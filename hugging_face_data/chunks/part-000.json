This is because, Section 11(1) states that the\n\ndate to be specified in the decree nisi as the date on which the defendant is to\n\nmake an application seeking leave to appear and show cause. These factors,\n\ntaken in conjunction with the prohibition imposed by Section 11(2) of the\n\nAct with the words Court shall not grant the defendant any further time to\n\nmake an application to enable the defendant to seek leave to appear and show cause"

It is well settled since the pronouncement of Rustom v Hapangama\n\n& Co., (1979) 1 Sri L.R. 352, that the insistence on the existence of\n\nexceptional circumstances, is a pre-requisite that warrants the exercise of\n\nthe discretion conferred on the Court of Appeal, in favour of a petitioner\n\nwho opted to invoke its jurisdiction conferred by Article 138 of the\n\nConstitution, when he failed to seek an alternative remedy available to\n\nhim.\n\nSection 16(1) of the Act states that no appeal shall lie against the\n\ndecree nisi, which has been made absolute due to the failure of a defendant\n\nto make an application in terms of Section 15(a). However, the Act itself\n\noffers an alternative remedy to a defendant who is aggrieved by an order\n\nmade under Section 12 of the Act. Section 16 confers power on the District\n\nCourt to entertain an application by a defendant, against whom a decree\n\nnisi has been made absolute, if such a defendant satisfies the original Court\n\nof either of the grounds that has been specified in Section 16(1)(a) and\n\n16(1)(b), and he is therefore entitled to have that decree absolute set aside\n\nsubject to imposing security, provided that such an application was made\n\nnot later than one year from the date on which the decree nisi was made\n\nabsolute. Therefore, the Defendant was required to satisfy the existence of\n\nS.C.

The exceptional circumstance on which the Court of Appeal\n\nacted in revising the order of the District Court was the deprivation of an\n\nopportunity for the Defendant to show cause against the decree nisi. In the\n\nprocess of reasoning adopted by that Court to arrive at the said finding, it\n\nhad failed to observe that the reason on which the Defendant could not be\n\ngranted any further time to show cause against the decree nisi was due to\n\noperation of law.

When an owner sues in ejectment an allegation in his\n\ndeclaration that he has granted the defendant a lease which is terminated is an\n\nunnecessary allegation and is merely a convenient way of anticipating the\n\ndefendant's plea that the latter is in possession by virtue of a lease, which plea\n\nwould call for a replication that the lease is terminated. It is the defendant and not\n\nthe owner-plaintiff who relies on the lease, and if the lease itself is denied by the\n\ndefendant, as in the present case, the allegation of the lease is a surplusage.\n\nThis position has been cited with approval in Senanayake v. Peter De Silva [(1986) 2 Sri\n\nLR 405] where Goonewardena, J., after examining several South African authorities which\n\nhave applied the principle expounded in Graham (supra), held (at page 411) that:\n\nThese authorities, it will be seen, go so far as to hold that it is sufficient for an\n\nowner in these circumstances to make an assertion of ownership to the property,\n\nwithout further statement that the defendant's right of occupation is at an end (if\n\nthat be the case) and upon the proof of such title to obtain recovery of possession.\n\nIndeed, they then demonstrate beyond any manner of doubt, that it is competent\n\nfor an owner who has leased his land, upon showing that the lessee has lost the\n\nright of occupation, to eject him on the strength of his title and that an action so\n\nframed is not misconceived nor that the action should be constituted as one against\n\nan over holding lessee based upon the lawful termination of the contract of lease,"

In Thilangani Kandambi vs. State Timber Corporation & Others3, this\n\nCourt identified four key principles on the application of Section 13(1) of the\n\nAct concerning Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

The initial view was that mere production of a complaint made to\n\nthe HRCSL within one month of the alleged infringement is\n\nsufficient to get the benefit of the provisions in section 13(1) of the\n\nHRCSL Act [Romesh Coorey v Jayalath (2008) 2 Sri.L.R. 43, Alles\n\nv. Road Passenger Services Authority of the Western Province,\n\n(S.C.F.R. 448/2009, S.C.M. 22.02.2013)].\n\nb. However, the present position is that a petitioner must show\n\nevidence that the HRCSL has conducted an inquiry regarding the\n\ncomplaint or that an inquiry is pending. Simply lodging a\n\ncomplaint is inadequate. [Subasinghe v. Inspector General of\n\nPolice, SC (Spl) 16/1999, S.C.M. 11.09.2000; Kariyawasam v.\n\nSouthern Provincial Road Development Authority and 8 Others,\n\n(2007) 2 Sri.L.R. 33; Ranaweera and Others v.

G.A.\n\nS.C.M. 11.09.2014)].\n\nd. The provisions of section 13(1) of the HRCSL are not available to a\n\npetitioner who has made a complaint to the HRCSL only to obtain\n\nan advantage by bringing his application within Article 126(2) of\n\nthe Constitution [K.H.G. Kithsiri v Faizer Musthapha, (S.C.F.R.\n\n362/2017, SCM 10.01.2018)].\n\n13. This Court finds that, when the Petitioner filed the initial application dated\n\n30/10/2015, he was fully aware that the jurisdictional requirement under\n\nArticle 126(2) of the Constitution had already been breached. By producing\n\nP9, the Petitioner sought to rely on the statutory exclusion from the\n\ncomputation of time under Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission\n\nAct, thereby placing the Respondents on notice of such reliance. This\n\nobviates the need for the Respondents to have raised a specific objection in\n\nthat regard.\n\n14. Nevertheless, the Petitioner has failed to establish that an inquiry was in fact\n\npending before the Human Rights Commission. No documentation has been\n\nproduced, and neither the original Petition nor the Amended Petition\n\nprovides any clarification in this regard. Accordingly, this Court holds that\n\nthe Petitioner cannot invoke the protection afforded by Section 13(1) of the\n\nAct. The burden of proving the applicability of the statutory exception lies\n\nsquarely with the Petitioner, and that burden has not been discharged.\n\n15. The legal maxim vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt, which\n\nmeans; the law assists those who are vigilant, not those who sleep on their\n\nrights, applies with full force in this instance.

The main objection amongst them is\n\nthat the applications are time bared in terms of Article 126(2) of the\n\nConstitution.\n\nTherefore, let me first deal with the said main preliminary objection\n\npertaining to the time bar as it amounts to a matter that goes into the core\n\nof the applications before the Court.\n\nPage 26 of 29\n\nI am of the view that if the said objection succeeds, considering the other\n\nfactual matters would become irrelevant.\n\nThe relevant Article 126(2) of the Constitution reads as follows;\n\n126. (2) Where any person alleges that any such Fundamental\n\nRights or Language Right relating to such person has been\n\ninfringed or is about to be infringed by executive or\n\nadministrative action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law on\n\nhis behalf, within one month thereof, in accordance with such\n\nrules of Court as maybe in force, apply to the Supreme Court by\n\nway of petition in writing addressed to such Court praying for\n\nrelief or redress in respect of such infringement. Such application\n\nmaybe proceeded with only with leave to proceed first had and\n\nobtained from the Supreme Court, which leave maybe granted or\n\nrefused, as the case maybe, by not less than two judges.\n\nAs I have highlighted previously, the petitioners have come before this Court\n\nchallenging the constitutionality of the Cabinet Memorandum No. 10/2015\n\ndated 26-03-2015, and the Cabinet decision taken in that regard on 23-05-\n\n2017. I find that, in their petition, the petitioners have conveniently failed to\n\nmention when they become aware of the said Cabinet decision.\n\nHowever, it appears that by referring to the document marked P-06(A),\n\nwhich is the letter issued by the Inspector General of Police on 18-03-2019"

I find no basis for one to\n\nargue that fact was not within their knowledge. They would have known very\n\nwell that there was no Cabinet Decision that would grant them an additional\n\npromotion."

This matter arises from an Appeal filed by the Petitioner seeking to set aside\n\nrelief prayed for in the Petition dated 28/09/2006 filed in the Court of Appeal.\n\n2. According to the Petition, the Petitioner was appointed as a Clerk Grade III at\n\nthe Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka with effect from 03/05/1999\n\n(P1), and was subsequently confirmed in that said post by letter dated\n\n26/01/2004 (P2). She was promoted to Clerk Grade II with effect from\n\n03/05/2005 (P3). Her service record indicates transfers across various\n\ndivisions of the University, including the Finance Division, the\n\nAdministration Division at Homagama and Colombo, and thereafter the\n\nInternal Examinations Division.\n\n3. The Petitioner states that, as she was ill and in a state of depression, she\n\ninformed the 1st Respondent University of her illness on 25/07/2006 via\n\ntelegram, followed by a medical certificate dated 21/07/2006 (P16) with a\n\nrecommendation of one months medical leave. On 27/07/2006, the\n\nP a g e 10 | 17\n\nPetitioner tendered her Letter of Resignation dated 27/07/2006 (P7), stating\n\nher intention to resign with effect from 24/07/2006. This was followed by the\n\nPetitioners letter dated 10/08/2006 (P8) which is the acknowledgement of\n\nthe consequences of resignation.\n\n4. The Petitioner contends that, subsequently, she recovered from her fragile\n\nstate of mind and, upon realizing the potential severity of her action and its\n\nconsequences, immediately submitted a letter dated 22/08/2006 (P9),\n\nseeking to withdraw both her Letter of Resignation dated 27/07/2006 and her\n\nletter of acknowledgment of the consequences of resignation dated\n\n10/08/2006.\n\n5. The Petitioner contends that upon receiving the Letter of Resignation, the\n\nPetitioner was informed of the consequences of resignation by letter dated"

The visibility capacity of urban people who are acclimatized to fluorescent lights or incandescent lamps is not the standard to be applied to villagers whose optical potency is attuned to country-made lamps. Their visibility is conditioned to such lights and hence it would be quite possible for them to identify men and matters in such lights.\n\nTherefore, in the instant case also PW1s recognition of the Appellants by the aid of the bottle lamp need not be disregarded at all because unlike the urbanized people who are used to fluorescent and neon lights the simple villager like PW1 who had not even gone to school has been used to the bottle lamp burning in the night all the life.

Wicks (1998) A.C. 92\n\nat 115; Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 A.C.\n\n143 at 156 and 161, and 173-4].\n\nHence, the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the requirement of possessing a Board\n\nCertificate physically by 31.12.2020 is not clearly reflected in P4 or P7.\n\nFurthermore, it is erroneous to consider the requirement of possessing Board Certification\n\nas at 31.12.2020 from the point of time when the applications are considered. Admittedly,\n\nthe transfers for 2021 were to take effect from 01.01.2021. Obtaining Board Certification\n\nafter that date although backdated to 2018 is irrelevant. In my view, the requirement in\n\nClause 5E must be considered as at 31.12.2020.\n\nPage 13 of 14\n\nThis approach is supported by the other requirements in both P4 and P7. According to\n\nClause 01, all posts where Specialist Medical Officers have completed 04 years from the\n\neffective date of transfer order by 31.12.2020 are considered as listed vacant posts.

Clause 04 states that the\n\nannual transfers will take effect from 01.01.2021 although both P4 and P7 were issued in\n\nMarch and April, 2021.\n\nWhen examined from that perspective, the Respondent was not Board Certified as at that\n\ndate notwithstanding the backdating of her Board Certification to 2018.\n\nThis is consistent with the position set out in Clause 6.3.11 of the Medical Service Minute\n\ndated 22.03.2001 which states that those who are eligible to apply for special posts are\n\nonly those who have got Board Certification and not those who are eligible to get Board"

According\n\nto the Petitioners, the Draft Marks List is based on the information and marks given by the\n\napplicants themselves and are not verified and checked.\n\nSubsequently, on 24.05.2021, an Amended Draft List was posted on the official website of\n\nthe Ministry of Health in which the name of the Respondent was removed. The Amended\n\nDraft List is prepared after verification by the Petitioners against the personal files of the\n\napplicants.\n\nIn these circumstances, there is nothing wrong in the authorities removing the name of\n\nthe Respondent from the Final Marks List, on the basis that she was not qualified, as the\n\nDraft Marks List was an unperfected decision. In L.J.K. Hettiarachchi and Another v. Pearl\n\nWeerasinghe, Commissioner General of Labour and Others [S.C. Appeal No. 37/2018,\n\nPage 14 of 14\n\nS.C.M. 18.07.2025], I held, for reasons more fully expounded therein, that an\n\nadministrative body can revisit an unperfected decision.\n\nMoreover, there are approximately 73 doctors who obtained Board Certification after\n\n31.12.2020 and were therefore ineligible to apply for transfers in 2021. Hence there was\n\nno discrimination of the Respondent.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, and in the circumstances of this application, I answer all\n\nthree questions of law in the affirmative.\n\nI set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 05.05.2022 and dismiss the\n\napplication made by the Respondent to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe appeal is allowed.\n\nParties shall bear their costs.\n\nJUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT\n\nP.

Section 207 accordingly makes the\n\njudgment of the Court conclusive not only as to matters actually pleaded, put\n\nin issue, and tried and decided, but also to matters which might, and\n\ndecided.\n\n[29] In the above case Wendt J. illustrated the effect of Section 207 CPC with the\n\nexample of a party holding two titles to the same land. If he sues on one and is\n\ndefeated, he cannot later sue on the other; equally, if he is sued in ejectment\n\nand defends on one title only, he cannot afterwards assert the other. His\n\nLordship explained that the Code requires all claims and defenses relating to\n\nthe same subject matter to be raised and determined in a single action, so that\n\neach case, once begun, is absolutely decisive of the rights of parties.\n\n[30] The circumstances in the example given in Baban Appu and in the present case\n\nare not identical, but they rest on the same principle. In that, it was the litigant\n\nwho attempted to divide his rights, withholding one title and then seeking to\n\nassert it in a later action. In the present case, the Plaintiff-Respondent pleaded\n\nhis cause of action on the basis of Constructive Trust. However, the District\n\nCourt, while accepting that the Plaintiff-Respondent had proved his title by\n\nDeed No. 4455 and that the Defendant-Appellant was in unlawful possession,\n\ndismissed the action on the ground that the trust as pleaded was not\n\nestablished. The effect of this reasoning is to compel the Plaintiff-Respondent\n\nto institute a further action based on title to obtain the relief of ejectment,\n\ndespite those matters having already been tried and determined. Both\n\nsituations involve the fragmentation of a single subject matter into multiple\n\nsuits. Whether the division is attempted by a party who sues or results from the\n\nP a g e 14 | 15\n\nprocedural approach adopted by the Court, the consequence leads to\n\nmultiplicity of actions, which Baban Appus case discourages."

General Manager, B.N.\n\nRailway and Others AIR 1952 CAL 610 it was stated,\n\nIt also appears to me that in the facts of this case the remedy by way of\n\nin dispute on several questions, namely, the authority by which the\n\npetitioner was appointed, the natures on inquiry if any made in the\n\nPage 12 of 14\n\npresent case, the denial of a right of appeal, the alleged imperfect nature\n\nof the inquiry and the alleged arbitrary conduct of certain offices of the\n\nrailway administration. It is difficult in my opinion, to arrive at a\n\nsatisfactory conclusion on these matters on mere affidavits. In order to\n\nget at truth, it is necessary that the questions referred to above should\n\nbe canvased in a suit where the parties would have ample opportunity of\n\nexamining their witnesses and the Court would be better able to judge\n\nwhich version is correct.\n\nIn the case of Aselro Financial Services (Private) Limited Vs.

This factual position falls within the ambit of Court\n\nof first instance to decide after an inquiry or trial. In such an inquiry\n\nor trial, the petitioner will also get an equal opportunity to contest\n\nthe trial. As factual matters are in issue this application is not\n\namendable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court.\n\nI find that the appellants have gone before the Court of Appeal claiming co-\n\nownership of the land, and their plea for a Writ of Certiorari had been based\n\non very much disputed facts as contemplated above.\n\nHence, I do not find any reason to disagree with His Lordship Justice of the\n\nCourt of Appeal on his refusal to issue the Writ as sought for the reasons\n\nstated in the judgement."

However, the Plaintiff did not assert a prescriptive title to the\n\ncorpus in the plaint. Instead, he relied solely upon the deeds produced in evidence and\n\nthe principles of intestate succession. Despite this, during the formulation of the points of\n\ncontest, the Plaintiff succeeded in introducing an issue relating to prescription.\n\nPage 9 of 11\n\nNevertheless, this issue was confined strictly to the land derived under the said deeds and\n\nby way of intestate succession.

    "chunk_text": "In Wijerathna v Sri Lanka Ports Authority [2020] SC (FR) Application No. 256/2017 - SC Minutes 11.12.2020, Justice Kodagoda explains the concept of equality as provided within Article 12(1) as follows:\n\nThe Petitioner complains that the fundamental rights of the Petitioner and that of its members guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been infringed for one or more of the following reasons:\n\ni. Arbitrary and discriminatory treatment by the 1st and 2nd Respondents in investigating the complaint made by the 3rd Respondent. ii. Investigation was biased, driven by the animosity of the 3rd Respondent. iii. This investigation caused public humiliation and distress. iv. Failure by the police to take action on her complaints against the 3rd Respondent amounts to a denial of equal protection of the law.\n\nThe 1st and 2nd Respondents deny any violation of the fundamental rights and that they acted in compliance with the Police Ordinance and the Criminal Procedure Code upon receiving a complaint of a serious nature. It was stated that the Petitioner was summoned on multiple occasions to record a statement but initially failed to appear. The 1st and 2nd Respondents assert that the case was withdrawn upon receipt of the Government Analysts report, the Petitioner was discharged and their actions were lawful, non-arbitrary, and consistent with\n\nPage 7 of 8\n\nthe duties imposed on the police, thereby not violating the Petitioners rights under Article 12(1).\n\nThe above view was reiterated in R.D. Shetty v International Airport Authority (1979) 3 SCC 489:\n\nThe principle of reasonableness and rationality which is legally as well as philosophically an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness is protected and it must characterize every State action, whether it be under authority of law or in exercise of executive power without making of law."

On all such accounts, it results in an infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution which guarantees equal protection of the law.\n\nThe Petitioners claims of unequal treatment under Article 12(1) must be assessed in the context of whether the Respondents conduct was arbitrary, unreasonable, or discriminatory. Equality before the law does not preclude the investigation of complaints made against individuals provided such investigations are conducted within the parameters of law and without malice or discrimination.\n\nThe allegations against the Petitioner stem primarily from the animosity of the 3rd Respondent and the personal disputes arising from the alleged loan transaction. The record reflects that the 1st and 2nd Respondents acted out of the scope of their lawful authority by making an application seeking further directions from the Learned Magistrate against the Petitioner, suppressing the directions given by the National Police Commission and by continuing to summon the Petitioner to the Thihagoda police and Mediation Board despite the directions given by the National Police Commission.

Accordingly, they had made a request for a rescheduling of the loan based on document P7, afterwards only Rs. 13 million had been ultimately released to the respondent.\n\nSubsequently, as reflected in P6, the loan had been rescheduled and brought down to Rs. 38 million, with Rs. 10 million had been held back by the appellant.\n\nThe consistent position of the respondents right through out, is that, although the initial agreement was for Rs. 48 million, the monies were not released to the respondent and it was the reason why they requested for a rescheduling. Even after such rescheduling, the respondents contend that only Rs. 13 million was released and not the Rs. 38 million as claimed.\n\nHence, the onus is on the appellant to show that the entirety of the monies, as alleged, was released to the respondents.\n\nIt is further observed that although the agreements marked as P1 and P2 enables the appellant to charge the respondent the bank rates of 22% plus the interest rate of 6.5% as stated in the agreement, the appellant has also charged an interest rate for default payment, which the respondent contends is illegal. It has to be noted that the alleged loan agreement has been signed by both parties and it has said that the appellant can charge an additional interest rate of 3% in the event of dishonoring the agreement.\n\nNevertheless, upon perusing the evidence led at the trial and the documents marked and produced, it has to be noted that the appellant has failed to produce any evidence or documentation to establish that the loan amount or the rescheduled was ever transferred to the respondents.\n\nHowever, there are documents confirming that the loan agreement took place and that both parties signed and that there was rescheduling and some securities offered but there is nothing to say that the monies have transferred."

This Court having heard the submissions of both learned Counsel\n\nParagraph 18b of the petition and also on question of law framed by this Court. I will\n\nquote the two questions of law as they read;\n\n18b. Have the learned Lordship of the Honorable Civil Appellate High Court\n\nof Kegalle erred in law in failing to take into account the fact that the\n\nPlaintiffs Petition to the Civil Appellate of Kegalle was tendered to the Court\n\nout of time and therefore should not have been entertained?\n\nQuestions of law formulated by this Court on May 23, 2023.\n\nSC/APPEAL/0085/20234\n\nHave the learned Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law by\n\nfailing to consider Sections 45 and 48 of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance in\n\nrelation to presentment for payment and dishonor well considering whether\n\nthe sums payable on -1 were in fact payable?\n\nAt the stage of argument both the learned Counsel for the Defendant and of the\n\nPlaintiff were heard and the judgment was reserved.\n\nFactual background\n\nThe Plaintiff instituted action against the Defendant in the District Court of Kegalle\n\nclaiming a sum of Rs. 375,000/- along with interest on the basis that she advanced\n\nthe said sum for which the Defendant furnished the promissory note marked P1 as\n\nsecurity. It was her case that she demanded the said sum which the Defendant\n\ndefaulted payment. Consequently, this action was filed under summary procedure set\n\nout in Chapter LIII of the Civil Procedure Code.\n\nThe Defendant having successfully made an application to unconditionally defend\n\nthe case, took up the position that he borrowed only a sum of Rs. 250,000/- out of\n\nwhich a sum of Rs. 135,000/- was repaid.1\n\nThe Defendant while challenging the promissory note and alleging that he never\n\nsigned the said document, stated in the answer that he placed his signature on a stamp"

However, in the appeal preferred to the\n\nProvincial Civil Appellate High Court, the learned Judges of the High Court have set\n\naside this reasoning.

Furthermore, although the Defendant and\n\nthe witnesses stated that the Defendant was unable to engage in his daily activities for\n\nseveral months, the Ayurvedic Physician recommended leave for only five days.

There is a practice among some lawyers to get up\n\nand say subject to proof whenever a document is marked in evidence by the other\n\nparty. This they do as a matter of course or as a matter of routine and not with any\n\nparticular objective in mind, except perhaps to prolong the trial. It is regrettable\n\nthat most of the time the party who produces the document obliges to this without a\n\nmurmur. If we are serious about laws delays, we must put an end to this bad\n\npractice. When a counsel routinely says subject to proof, the Judge must ask what\n\nhe wants the other party to prove in the document. If this simple question is asked, I\n\nam certain the objection would be withdrawn or at least the issue to be addressed\n\nwould be narrowed down. On the other hand, if the document is, take for instance, a\n\nDeed pleaded in the plaint but no issue has been raised disputing the Deed, the\n\nDefendant cannot make a routine application to mark it subject to proof when it is\n\nmarked in evidence. Against this backdrop, I must emphasize that the Judge shall\n\nnot mechanically refuse documents marked subject to proof but not technically\n\nproved by calling witnesses. The Judge shall decide the question of proof at the\n\nend of the trial on the facts and circumstances of each individual case.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nThis rule is applicable vice versa.

The learned Judge of the High Court observed that\n\nis caused to the opposite party when an application for amendment of pleadings is made.\n\nThe learned High Court Judge found no evidence of laches and, on that basis, sanctioned\n\nthe amendment of the Plaintiffs Plaint through an Order issued on 11.10.2019.\n\nPage 5 of 10\n\nBeing aggrieved by the said Order of the High Court, the Defendants instituted these\n\nproceedings seeking to get both the Orders of the High Court and District Court set aside.\n\nThis Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following questions set out in Paragraphs (a),\n\n(b) and (f) of the Petition dated 21.11.2018:\n\n(a) Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law by misapplying Section 93(2) of the\n\nCivil Procedure Code?\n\n(b) Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law and/ or in fact by failing to consider\n\nthat the Respondent has not pleaded and/ or submitted any ground which could satisfy\n\nthat the refusal of the proposed amendment would cause a grave and irremediable\n\ninjustice to the Respondent?\n\n(f) Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law in concluding that the Respondent is\n\nnot guilty of laches?\n\nThe Defendants argue that the District Court Order dated 11.07.2018 is contrary to the\n\nprovisions of Section 93(2) of the CPC and relevant judicial precedents.

The Defendants assert that the Plaintiff is\n\nguilty of laches, as the facts relating to the proposed amendments were known to the\n\nPlaintiff when the action was filed and do not relate to any new events or facts that\n\nemerged later."

The\n\nDefendant contends that the District Court, despite such findings, has erroneously allowed\n\nthe amendment on a flawed basis.\n\nPage 6 of 10\n\nThe stand taken by the Plaintiff is that the District Court must identify the cause of action\n\ntogether with the real dispute between the parties, granting its authority to allow necessary\n\namendments even following the amendments to Section 93(2) of the CPC. The Plaintiff\n\ncontends that the Amended Plaint did not introduce a new cause of action but merely\n\nelaborated on the original one. The Plaintiff asserts that although Section 93 of the CPC\n\nwas amended by Act No. 9 of 1991 with the introduction of Section 93(2) regarding the\n\namendment of pleadings, other relevant sections, namely Sections 18, 21, 146, 148, and\n\n149 of the CPC, remain unchanged.

Therefore, if the pension scheme of the bank is to be applied, he must at first reach the age of 55 years or has to be qualified for the grounds stipulated above to retire before the age of 55 years.\n\n8"

But even assuming this to have been proved, the plaintiff\n\nwould not necessarily be entitled to the benefit of the doctrine of enormis\n\nlaesio.

Kiri Appu 29 NLR 381, it was held;\n\nAt the trial the appellant did not press the question of the trust. There\n\nwas therefore only the claim on the grounds of laesio enormis, and the\n\nlearned District Judge held that such a claim would not be made as the\n\nPage 18 of 19\n\nappellant did not allege that she was not aware of the real value of the\n\nland, and, further, that on the averments in the plaint there was sufficient\n\nconsideration.

The transaction as it\n\nwas described in the plaint was not a sale; according to the sale no sum\n\nof Rs. 300/- passed, nor apparently was it intended to passed; it was a\n\ntransfer in trust for the appellant, and the doctrine of laesio enormis has\n\nno application in such a case.\n\nThe above line of authority clearly establishes that to claim Laesio Enormis,\n\nthe person who sells the land to another must have the intention to sell the\n\nland, but due to the facts and the circumstances, the seller could not have\n\nknown the true value of the land. It has to be established that as a result, he\n\nsold it for less than half of its actual value."
