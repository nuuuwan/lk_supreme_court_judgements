Section 11 of the Act, states that the general administration of the Act is with the Commissioner and the interpretation section defines Commissioner to be the holder of the Commissioner of Labour (which office has now been re-named Commissioner General of Labour) and Section 20 of the Act safeguards the primacy of this Act over such other written law. Thus, the provisions of this Act specifically and has categorically given the Commissioner jurisdiction to make necessary orders when he determines that an employer has terminated the services of a workmen in contravention of the law. This brings us to the pivotal issue in this appeal. Is the determination of the 1st Respondent in this appeal, in accordance with the provisions of the Act or is it a nullity?

Prior to considering the aforesaid proposition of the Appellant, I wish to consider the concept of transfer as the \u2018transfer\u2019 is the material issue in this application. The right of an employer to transfer an employee has undoubtedly been acknowledged and accepted by Courts in many an instance. The 1970 case of the Ceylon Estate Staffs\u2019 Union Vs The Superintendent Meddecombra Estate, Watagoda and another 73 NLR 278 is one such case and a leading authority. In the said case at page 281, Weeramantry, J. states thus: -",

    "text": "\u201cThere is of course no general principle that an employee is in all cases bound to accept such a transfer order under protest, for there may be cases, where the mala fides prompting such an order is so self-evident or the circumstance of the transfer so humiliating that the employee may well refuse to act upon it\u2026\u201d Thus, the inherent right of an employer to transfer an employee within the service must be made bona fide and for good and valid reasons and in terms of the contract of employment. In the Meddecombra Estate case referred to above, the transfer was within the estate from one division to another and the Court held the refusal of the workman to comply with the transfer, justified the employers right of termination of the services of the workman. It is observed that the afore mentioned case was an appeal from a Labour Tribunal decision prior to the enactment of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act of 1971 the statute under which the 1st Respondent made Order in the instant appeal. As discussed earlier, the appellants\u2019 initial intimation to the employees was that the impugned transfer was a transfer within the service. Thereafter the Appellant abandoned the said position and took up the stand that it was a transfer to an associate company and clause (ii) of the letter of appointment permitted such a transfer. Clause (ii) of the letter of appointment reads thus, \u201cYou will be attached to our factory at Ekala/Any other associate company.\u201d Clause (ii) sits between clause (i) which speaks of the date of appointment and clause (iii) which refers to probation. Thus in my view, upon a plain reading of the said clause and the flow of the clauses, clause (ii) refers to the original \u2018attachment\u2019 at the time of commencement of employment and clause (vi) which incorporates the employers\u2019 right to transfer as discussed earlier, speaks of a \u2018transfer\u2019 that would take place whilst been in service and attached to a particular place.",
