JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare PC. J.,

1. The Applicant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Applicant) invoked the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal alleging that his

services were unjustly terminated by the Monetary Board, the Respondent-

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent).

2. After inquiry the Learned Labour Tribunal President by the order dated 16th

October 2009 held that the termination of the services of the Applicant was

justified.

4

3. Aggrieved by the order of the Labour Tribunal, the Applicant canvassed the

said order by way of an appeal before the High Court, and the Learned High

Court Judge upon considering the appeal, set aside the order of the Learned

Labour Tribunal President, holding that the Applicants services were

wrongfully terminated, and granted the following relief;

a) The Applicant was held entitled to the salary up to the age of retirement

(60 years)

b) Compensation in the sum of Rs. 1,000,000/= (one million) and his

pension rights

4. Aggrieved by the judgement of the Learned High Court Judge, the Appellant-

Respondent sought Special Leave to Appeal against the said judgement.

Consequently, this court granted Special Leave to Appeal on the following

questions of law (vide SC Minutes 08.08.2012);

i. Did the Learned High Court Judge err in placing reliance on the evidence

of two domestic inquiries or matters related thereto without considering

the nature of and conduct of the proceedings before the Labour

Tribunal?

ii. Did the Learned High Court Judge err in failing to consider his appellate

role when reviewing the order of the Labour Tribunal, which can only

be on a question of law?

iii. Did the Learned High Court Judge err in making an order that the

Respondent is entitled to the relief of compensation in lieu of

reinstatement in addition to payment of back-wages and pension?

The Factual Matrix

5. The Applicant who had joined the Central Bank as a non-staff officer in the

year 1969, and having gained several promotions, had been serving in the

5

capacity of Senior Analyst Programmer (Grade 2-Staff Class) when his services

were terminated on 25th July 2002.

6. It is in evidence that at the point of terminating his services, the Applicant was

entrusted with the task of preparing staff salaries and this exercise included the

preparation of the Applicants salary as well. It is also in evidence that this

process (of preparing salaries) was carried out with the aid of a computer

software called Payroll Module of Integrated Human Resource Management-

AS 400.

7. It is alleged that the Applicant, who was not entitled to a Floor Allowance,

had prepared his own salaries for the months of February and March 2000, in

such a way that an additional sum of Rs. 5000/= was added to his salary for

the said months. It is also in evidence that in crediting salaries to the respective

employees of the Central Bank, based on the data entered by the Applicant, he

caused to have an additional sum of Rs. 10,000/= credited to his bank account.

8. Towards the end of March, what the Applicant had done had been detected and

consequently, with effect from 23rd March 2000 he had been suspended from

service followed by being charge sheeted. Subsequent to a domestic inquiry,

the services of the Applicant had been terminated in 2002.

9. As referred to earlier, the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal, having

considered the evidence led at the inquiry on behalf of the Monetary Board,

had come to a finding that the Applicant had committed a fraudulent act by

causing to have two additional sums of Rs. 5000/= each credited to his account

and had acted in a manner not befitting to an officer of the Central Bank. The

Learned President of the Labour Tribunal held that the termination of the

services of the Applicant was reasonable and justified under the circumstances.

6

Consequently, the application of the Applicant was dismissed by the Learned

President of the Labour Tribunal.

10. The Learned High Court Judge, however, by his judgement dated 30th September

2011, set aside the order of the Labour Tribunal and held that the termination

of the services of the Applicant was wrongful. The Learned High Court Judge

also held that the Applicant is entitled to receive his salary up to the point of the

Applicant reaching the age of 60 (up to 31st July 2005), Rs. 1,000,000/= (one

million) as compensation and granted his pension rights.

The High Court Judgement

11. The Learned High Court Judge has set aside the order of the Learned President

of the Labour Tribunal on the basis that the Labour Tribunal President has failed

to evaluate the evidence led at the inquiry (page 11 of the judgement).

12. As reasons for the conclusion referred to in the preceding paragraph, the

Learned High Court Judge has stated the following;

a) The Learned High Court Judge had considered extensively the two

domestic inquiries held against the Applicant wherein at the first inquiry

the Applicant had been exonerated and in the subsequent domestic

inquiry the applicant had been found guilty.

b) The inquirer who held the domestic inquiry had carefully analysed the

evidence led in the inquiry and had very correctly exonerated the

Applicant and that there was no necessity to have a second domestic

inquiry on fresh charges. The Learned High Court Judge had held that

the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal had failed to consider the

7

evidence led and order made at the domestic inquiries. Again, at page 15

of the judgement the Learned High Court Judge had reiterated the fact

that there was no justification to have the Applicant subjected to a second

domestic inquiry after he was exonerated at the first.

c) The Learned High Court Judge has also referred to the numerous

hardships the Applicant had undergone as a result of losing his job, and

had reproduced in his judgement (at page 15) the contents of a letter

addressed to the Director-Establishments, Central Bank by the Applicant

in that regard.

d) Further the Learned High Court Judge had referred to the evidence given

by a witness at the domestic inquiry (at page 17) and had reproduced

the questions put and answers given by the witness verbatim. The

Learned High Court Judge had concluded that this witness who testified

before the domestic inquiry had given contrary evidence, before the

Labour Tribunal (at page 18).

e) The Learned High Court Judge also referred to the fact that the same

Inquirer who held the initial domestic inquiry against the Applicant and

exonerated him had, at the subsequent domestic inquiry, held that the

Applicant was guilty of the three charges and by changing the

conclusion, had caused a serious prejudice to the Applicant.

f) The Learned High Court Judge had found fault with the Learned

President of the Labour Tribunal for not paying due attention to the fact

that the domestic inquiry had not been held in a just manner.

13. It appears from the above, that the sole reason for the Learned High Court Judge

to set aside the order of the Labour Tribunal had been the unjust manner, as

8

the Learned High Court Judge says, in which the domestic inquiry against the

Applicant was held.

14. Nowhere in his judgement had the Learned High Court Judge referred to or

considered any evidence given either on behalf of the Respondent (Monetary

Board) or the Applicant, before the Labour Tribunal. All what the Learned High

Court Judge had considered is the material placed before the domestic inquiry

(pages 11-24). On pages 1-10, the Learned High Court Judge had stated the

positions taken up at the argument before him, by the respective parties.

The Two Domestic Inquiries

15. As one of the questions this court is called upon to answer is whether the

Learned High Court Judge erred in placing undue weightage/reliance on the

evidence led at the domestic inquiry to arrive at the conclusion, I feel- although

it might not be directly relevant- that for the sake of completeness, it would be

pertinent to refer to the two domestic inquiries referred to by the Learned

High Court Judge.

16. In the first charge sheet served on the Applicant, it is alleged that the Applicant

facilitated the crediting of Rs. 5000/= for the month of February and March

2000 in favour of his bank account in the Peoples Bank. The Inquirer had come

to a finding that this charge against the Applicant had not been established

(document marked as R32 (a) before the Labour Tribunal).

17. The Central Bank, acting in terms of Rule 33 of the Central Bank Classification,

Control and Appeal Rules requested a further inquiry into certain specific

aspects. Two of them were; whether it can be established in which module the

9

change in data which facilitated the alleged fund transfer to take place i.e. the

payroll module or the SLIPS module and In the event the change affected was

in the payroll module, whether any person other than the accused officer had

access to that module (R33).

18. In response to the request for a further inquiry the Inquirer had re-opened the

inquiry and had recalled two of the witnesses who had given evidence earlier,

in order to clarify the queries raised; and the Applicant had taken part in the

inquiry represented by his Defending Officer. At the conclusion of the further

inquiry the Inquirer had concluded that the change of data has occurred in the

payroll module (paragraph 19 of R34) and only the Applicant had the

opportunity to work on the payroll module.

19. Before proceeding to consider the questions of law that this court is called upon

to answer, I wish to state the factual position with regard to the preparation of

staff salaries at the Central Bank as evidenced before the Labour Tribunal.

a) The process consists of two stages according to witness Jayawardena;

payroll module handled by the Applicant, and the SLIPS module

handled by the witness. According to Jayawardenas testimony salary

particulars are entered by the Applicant, and once that step is

completed, based on the data entered, the witness ensures that the

salaries are credited to the respective bank accounts of the staff

members.

b) In response to questions directed by the Labour Tribunal, the witness

has said that it was the Applicant who entered the data and further, in

relation to the amount that should be credited in favour of the

Applicant for the month of March 2000, data was entered by the

10

Applicant, and that this witness is incapable of changing them once the

data is entered.

c) According to the document marked as R17, a report compiled by

witness Mala Dayaratne, she had carried out a periodic system test run

on salary and other payments categories on 22nd March 2000,

when the witness had compared the total figures generated on the 21st

March and 22nd March, had detected a discrepancy of Rs. 5000/= in

the payroll live run. As an initial step, the witness had checked for

any bugs in the system and found no defects.

d) Eventually she had traced the discrepancy, in the net salary figure of

employee bearing ID No. 2083 which was of the Applicant. The net

salary figure of the Applicant on 21st March 2000 was recorded as Rs.

9371/= and on the following day it had been changed and the salary

figure reflected as Rs.4371/= (a deficit of Rs.5000/=). According to

witness Mala Dayaratne, once the payroll and the SLIPS processes

are completed, the person who is in charge of the payroll module can

change the data without the permission of anyone and during the

relevant period, the payroll module had been under the control of the

Applicant

e) It had been established that the Applicant was entitled to a salary of Rs.

4371/= and not for a salary of 9371/= for the month of March 2000.

A further inquiry had led to the detection of a similar occurrence in the

previous month (February) as well in favour of the Applicant.

f) The Applicant in his evidence had admitted that he was in charge of the

payroll module in the month of March. On the other hand, the

Applicant had not disputed the fact that although his salary entitlement

11

for the month of February and March were Rs.5, 542.52 and Rs.4,

371.41 respectively, that sums of Rs.10, 542.52 and Rs.9341.41 had

been credited to his account.

g) In fact, the Applicants due salary was Rs.28, 554.98 and Rs.28, 644.52

for the months of February and March 2000, due to the deductions of

Rs.23, 012.46, and Rs.24, 273.11 for those two months, his residual

salary had been low as referred to in paragraph (f).

h) If the crediting of the extra amount (Rs.5000) in the favour of the

Applicant was a mistake or due to the intervention of a third party, the

Applicant ought to have noticed it when more than double the amount

due to him as salary, got credited to his account in the month of

February. The Applicant, on the contrary, admitted that he withdrew

Rs.8000/= in February.

Questions of Law

20. The issue before the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal was, whether

the termination of the services of the Applicant by the Central Bank was unjust

or not, taking into account all the facts and circumstances under which the

services were terminated.

21. On the other hand, the mandate of an Inquirer, holding a domestic inquiry

relating to a worker is to determine whether the specific charges levelled

against the worker had been established or not.

22. It is needless to state that these two exercises cannot be equated, although one

might argue that the same set of evidence more or less might be relevant in

both processes.

12

23. The Labour Tribunal is required to hold an inquiry before determining this

factor and is further required to consider the oral testimonies and other

material placed before it, in this exercise.

24. Section 31(C)(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act dealing with duties and powers

of the Labour Tribunal stipulates that; Where an application under section

31B is made to a labour tribunal, it shall be the duty of the tribunal to make all

such inquiries into that application and hear all such evidence as the tribunal

may consider necessary and thereafter make, not later than six months from

the date of such application, such order as may appear to the tribunal to be just

and equitable. [Emphasis added]

25. The Learned President of the Labour Tribunal had considered the oral evidence

led on behalf of the Central Bank (pages 2-5 of the order) and the documents

produced at the inquiry and had arrived at the conclusion that the termination

of the services of the Applicant was just and equitable.

26. The judgement of the Learned Judge of the High Court must be viewed in the

context of the provision referred to above. I wish to observe that the Learned

President of the Labour Tribunal had adhered to the requirements of the said

statutory provision. However, the same could not be said of the High Court

judgement.

27. It is in this backdrop that this court needs to consider whether the Learned High

Court Judge erred in placing reliance on the evidence of the two domestic

inquiries in overturning the order of the Labour Tribunal.

28. At the outset, it must be said that there is no statutory requirement to conduct

a domestic inquiry prior to the imposition of disciplinary action, however,

13

courts have emphasized on its desirability, especially to establish the bona fides

of the employer [see St. Andrews Hotels Ltd. v. Ceylon Mercantile Union CA

138 /85 Court of Appeal minutes 01.04.1993].

29. In the case of The Batticaloa Multi-Purpose Co-operative Societies Union Ltd., v.

Velupillai 76 NLR 60, Justice Alles considered the relevance of the use of evidence

given at a domestic inquiry and commented;

I see no objection to Presidents of Labour Tribunals examining or even acting on

the evidence led at the domestic inquiry, after satisfying themselves that the

evidence has been properly recorded, ensuring that the workman had a fair

opportunity of meeting the allegations made against him and seeking support for

his findings from the evidence so led. No doubt, in certain matters the President

has naturally to be cautious in accepting the deposition of a witness who has not

been called at the inquiry before.

30. Whilst holding that the President is expected to act judicially, Justice Alles

commenting on the duty cast on the President of a Labour Tribunal in terms of

Section 31(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act went on to hold Needless to say that

does not mean that Presidents must not conform to the elementary principles of

natural justice and evaluate the evidence in a judicial manner before making

proper orders.(at page 66 of the judgement).

31. Thus, it appears that the ratio in the case of Velupillai (supra) is that the Labour

Tribunal President holding an inquiry in terms of Section 31(c) of the Industrial

Disputes Act is vested with the discretion as to the extent of the evidence led at the

domestic inquiry that may be used, in deciding the issues before the Labour

Tribunal.

32. It is my view that the evidence led at the domestic inquiry might have a

corroborative value or may be used to evaluate the credibility of the testimonies of

14

the witnesses who had testified at the inquiry, but should not be considered as

substantive evidence to decide the issue of justification for the termination.

33. In that context the learned High Court Judge had clearly misdirected himself in

holding that, the failure on the part of the learned Labour Tribunal President to

consider the unfairness in holding a second domestic inquiry is a serious lapse

on the part of the President.

34. In fact, there had not been a second domestic inquiry, but rather a reopening of

the domestic inquiry in terms of the Central Bank rules and the Applicant do not

appear to have objected to or challenged the direction to have the domestic inquiry

reopened.

35. Furthermore, the learned High Court Judge had made a sweeping statement that

the Respondent had failed to prove the case against the Applicant on a balance of

probability. The learned Judge, however, had not substantiated that statement by

reference to any shortcomings of the Respondents case or the credibility of the

witness on whom the learned President had relied on.

36. Upon the consideration of the facts referred to above and the legal position stated,

I hold that the learned High Court Judge erred in placing reliance on the manner

in which the domestic inquiry was conducted, in order to overturn the order of

the learned President of the Labour Tribunal, and accordingly answer the question

of law referred to (i) above, in the affirmative.

Right of Appeal is Limited to Questions of Law

37. In terms of Section 31D (2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, a party dissatisfied with

the order of the Labour Tribunal has a right of appeal on a question of law.

15

38. It was contended on behalf of the Respondent-Appellant [The Monetary Board]

that the learned High Court judge erred in reviewing the impugned order of the

Labour Tribunal which is opened to be reviewed only on a question of law.

39. In the case of Ceylon Transport Board v. W. A. D. Gunasinghe 72 NLR 76 Justice

Weeramantry held; Where a Labour Tribunal makes a finding of fact for which

there is no evidence-a finding which is both inconsistent with the evidence and

contradictory of it-the restriction of the right of the Supreme Court to review

questions of law does not prevent it from examining and interfering with the order

based on such a finding if the Labour Tribunal is under a duty to act judicially.

40. Justice A.R.B. Amerasinghe in Jayasuriya v. Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation (1995) 2 SLR 379, based on the evaluation of the findings of a

number of cases, identified instances in which the appellate courts could review

the findings of a Labour Tribunal treating it as a question of law; The Industrial

Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 S. 31D states that the order of a Labour Tribunal shall

be final and shall not be called in question in any court except on a question of

law. While appellate courts will not intervene with pure findings of fact, they will

review the findings treating them as a question of law: if it appears that the

Tribunal has made a finding wholly unsupported by evidence, or which is

inconsistent with the evidence and contradictory of it; or where the Tribunal has

failed to consider material and relevant evidence; or where it has failed to decide

a material question or misconstrued the question at issue and had directed its

attention to the wrong matters; or where there was an erroneous misconception

amounting to a misdirection; or where it failed to consider material documents or

misconstrued them or where the Tribunal has failed to consider the version of one

party or his evidence; or erroneously supposed there was no evidence. [emphasis

added]

41. From the above cited judgments it is clear that- in the context that the decision of

a Labour Tribunal can be reviewed by an appellate court only on a question of

16

law- the Supreme Court has identified certain permissible instances where the

findings of fact made by a Labour Tribunal can be considered as a question of law

and reviewed by an appellate court. In the instant case the learned President of the

Labour Tribunal has given due consideration to the evidence led before him and

the documents produced at the inquiry. Even the learned High Court Judge had

not found fault with the Learned President of the Labour tribunal in that regard. I

have considered the order made by the Labour Tribunal and hold that the findings

of the Labour Tribunal in the present case does not fall within any of the

permissible instances referred to in the case of Jayasuriya (supra) and thus I

conclude that the Learned High Court Judge erred in reviewing the impugned

order of the Labour Tribunal.

42. Accordingly, I answer the question of law referred to (ii) above also in the

affirmative.

The Correctness of the Relief ordered by the Learned High Court Judge

43. As I have concluded that the first two questions of law on which Special Leave to

Appeal was granted should be answered in the affirmative, the correctness of the

relief ordered by the Learned High Court Judge cease to be of any consequence.

The Learned High Court Judge has on an erroneous assumption reviewed the

decision of the Labour Tribunal and granted relief on the finding that the

Applicant was wrongfully terminated. Thus, I do not wish to proceed in answering

the question of law referred to (iii) above.

44. Accordingly, I set aside the judgement of the learned High Court Judge dated 30-

09-2011 and affirm the order of the learned president of the Labour Tribunal

dated 16-10-2009.

17

In the circumstances of this case I do not wish to order any costs and further this

judgement will not affect any statutory dues the Applicant might be entitled to.
