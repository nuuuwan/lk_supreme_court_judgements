Two petitioners in this matter invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126

of the Constitution. They allege that their right to equality guaranteed under Article

12(1) of the Constitution, in common with the other members of the general public of

Sri Lanka, had been violated. They contend that they invoke the jurisdiction of this

Court in their own interest as well as in the public interest. They further contend that

such violation took place due to the wrongful conduct of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

respondents namely the Minister of Justice, Secretary Ministry of Justice and

Assistant Secretary (Administration) Ministry of Justice, respectively. They inter alia

move the Court to issue an Order quashing the letter produced marked X6, which is

signed and counter signed by the Secretary, Ministry of Justice and Assistant

Secretary (Administration) Ministry of Justice.

X6 is a letter that is addressed to four recipients. They are the 1st and the 2nd

Petitioners and 4th and the 5th Respondents. The aforesaid four recipients by X6 have

been informed to perform their duties in the capacity of Inquirers in to Sudden Death

in the Division of Colombo City. The said letter assigns four days of the week namely

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday for the 1st Petitioner and 4th Respondent.

SC FR 230/2018

4

The balance three days namely Friday, Saturday and Sunday are assigned to 2nd

Petitioner and 5th Respondent.

Petitioners contend that the 4th and the 5th respondents are not competent to function

as Additional Colombo City Coroners. The basis for this contention is that both the

4th and 5th respondents are not Attorneys-at-Law.

This Court on 08 May 2019, granted leave to proceed on the alleged violation of

Article 12(1). Court also has granted interim relief in terms of paragraph (d) of the

prayer of the Petition dated 17 July 2018. By this order, the 4th and 5th respondents

had been restrained from functioning as Additional Colombo City Coroners until the

final determination of this application.

The Secretary Bar Association who is named the 8th Respondent as well as the 6th

respondent, who is a former Inquirer for the city of Colombo (Colombo City Coroner)

associate themselves with the submissions made in support of this application.

Furthermore, the 6th respondent submits that the Ministry of Justice developed the

basic qualifications for the post of Inquirer for the City of Colombo and such

qualifications were made equivalent to the basic qualifications required for the post of

Magistrate namely, experience as an attorney-at-law for not less than four years. This

respondent and the petitioners submit that the document marked X4 is a copy of the

approved scheme of recruitment. He contend that the said document marked X4 was

sent to the Director of Establishments by the Secretary of Justice along with the letter

dated 06 February 1981, which is produced marked X3. X3 letter titled Approval of

a Scheme of Recruitment, Inquirer into Sudden Deaths Colombo City has been

sent in response to the letter of the Director Establishments dated 21 January 1981,

which is produced marked X2 The document marked X4 sets out 6 items. Item no. 3

sets out the educational qualifications - an Attorney-at-Law with minimum of four

years active practice. According to X4, this post is a permanent pensionable post

with a fixed salary structure.

The petitioners having listed out the powers and functions of an inquirer, claim that

they should possess the ability to read and properly understand documents (including

SC FR 230/2018

5

bed-head tickets), the ability to analyze oral and documentary evidence, the ability to

act impartially and independently without being succumbed to pressure that might be

exerted politicians and leaders of the under world. They further claim that the

function of an inquirer into sudden deaths is a judicial function (emphasis added).

The 6th Respondent also emphasizes on the importance of the functions and duties of

an inquirer. It is in this context the petitioners and the 6th Respondent claim that a

person functioning as the Inquirer in to sudden deaths Colombo City who is also

called Colombo City Coroner should be an Attorney-at-Law. Further, they claim it

was the tradition and practice to appoint an Attorney-at-Law to function in the last

mentioned post.

However, the 2nd respondent; the Secretary, Ministry of Justice, does not support the

position taken up by the Petitioners as well as the 6th Respondent. The 2nd respondent

submits that neither the originals of X2, X3 and X4 nor any other letter connected to

such correspondence; or any file relating to such documents is available at the

Ministry. The 2nd respondent further contend that there is no such post available called

Inquirer in to sudden death Colombo City exists and there are no inquirers in to

sudden deaths appointed to a permanent pensionable post in the public service.

Furthermore, it is submitted that the post of an inquirer into sudden deaths is an

honorary position for a fixed period of five years, without any salary attached to it,

other than an allowance of rupees five hundred being paid to each inquiry, conducted.

The letter of appointment issued to the first Petitioner is with the heading

appointment as an Inquirer in to sudden deaths Colombo City and the letter of

appointment issued to the second petitioner is with the title appointment as a Inquirer

in to sudden deaths Colombo City (Additional). Both appointments are termed as

permanent inquirer into sudden deaths and valid for a period of five years ending 01

January 2019 unless cancelled before. Both these appointments were made in

November 2014 to be effective from 01 December 2014. These appointments were

made in consequent to the recruitment process initiated with the notice published in

the Gazette No 1,838 dated 22nd November 2013 by the Secretary, Ministry of Justice

(X5).

SC FR 230/2018

The said advertisement calls for applications to appoint Inquirers in to sudden death

under section 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, to fill up the vacancy in the

Colombo City limits. According to the said notice the position advertised is not a

salaried permanent position in the public service. However, an allowance of rupees

five hundred is paid per each inquiry. Furthermore, according to the advertisement,

five persons were to be recruited and each one of them should work one day per

week. Basic qualifications an applicant should possess include being an attorney-at-

law with a practice of more than four years.

It is pertinent to note that the appointments of both 4th and the 5th respondents pre

dates the appointments of both petitioners. Appointments of the aforesaid two

respondents were made in the year 2012 (R2 - 4R3 and R3 - 5R3). Subsequently, their

period of service had been extended (R2(a) - 4R6 and R3(a) - 5R6).

The recruitment process relating to the aforementioned two respondents was initiated

with a notice published in the Gazette No 1,705 dated 06 May 2011 (R1 - 4R1 - 5R1).

The Secretary Ministry of Justice by the said notice has called for applications to the

post of Inquirers in to sudden death to fill up the vacancies in the areas listed in the

said notice. Required minimum educational qualifications for the post as advertised

was three passes in the G.C.E (Advanced Level) examination, where preference was

given to the candidates who had passed the exam in science stream. This

advertisement was to fill-up vacancies in several districts. They include Badulla,

Colombo, Gampaha, Hambanthota, Kaluthara and Monaragala districts. Under

Colombo District, vacancies were advertised in seven divisional secretary divisions

and one such division is Colombo and the Inquirer into sudden deaths division

identified is Colombo General Hospital. In addition to above, applications had been

called for Inquire in to Sudden Deaths (Muslim) in Colombo, Gampaha and Kaluthara

Districts. It is in consequent to this notice the two respondents had applied and

appointed to the respective positions.

On an examination of all the material placed before this court by all the parties, the

court is unable to conclude that an approved scheme of recruitment for the post of

Inquirer into Sudden Deaths (Colombo City) exists. Although the document marked

SC FR 230/2018

7

X4 is titled Scheme of Recruitment - Post of Inquirer into Sudden Deaths Colombo

City, the salary structure set out under item 1 and the description provided under

item 5 (that it is a permanent pensionable post) do not correspond to the notice

published in the Gazette No 1,838 dated 22nd November 2013 by the Secretary,

Ministry of Justice (X5). In fact, according to the notice in the said gazette, the post

advertised is not a permanent position in the public service and with no salary

attached but with only an allowance of rupees five hundred per inquiry is paid. These

discrepancies between the scheme of recruitment - X4 - and the actual description in

the gazette notification - X5 - weighs in favour of the position taken up by the 2nd

respondent, the secretary of the Ministry of Justice. It is his contention that the

minimum qualifications set out in calling for applications to the post of Inquirer into

sudden deaths had varied at different stages. In 2001, the required qualification was

passing six subjects with four credit passes at the G.C.E (Ordinary Level)

Examination (R6). In 2009, 2011 and 2016 the required qualification was three credit

passes at the G.C.E (Advanced Level) Examination. However, in 2013, the required

qualification had been an attorney-at-law with minimum of four years experience.

It is pertinent to note that while section 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No 15 of 1979 governs the appointment of Inquirers, rest of the provisions in Chapter

XI of the same Code set out their powers and duties relating to investigations. Chapter

XXX of the Code, govern the matters relating to Inquests of Death.

The statute does not set out the required qualifications to perform the functions of an

Inquirer. The power to make the appointment and to set out the area in which they are

to perform their duties is a matter left to the Minister. Therefore, a decision on the

necessary minimum qualifications and the geographical area within which duties to be

performed by an Inquirer should be based on objective and reasonable criteria. In this

regard it is pertinent to note that powers and duties an Inquirer has to perform does

not depend on the geographical area in which he has to perform the duties. All

persons should be treated equally. Therefore, setting out different criteria based on the

area of service per se could lead to unequal treatment unless such differentia is based

SC FR 230/2018

8

on justifiable objective criteria on valid reasons and one such criteria could be the

competency in a particular language depending on the area of service. The Supreme

Court in fact had accepted that classifications are allowed if they are not arbitrary and

founded upon intelligible differentia. Ananda Dharmadasa and Others v

Ariyaratne Hewage and Others ([2008] 2 SLR 19, Tuan Ishan Raban and Others

v Members of the Police Commission ([2007] 2 SLR 351. The objective of this

requirement is to treat equals equally and not unequally.

However, the material available in these proceedings do not indicate that such criteria

exists to make a distinction between the minimum qualifications needed to perform

duties of an Inquirer in Colombo City and duties of an Inquirer in any other part of the

island. Furthermore, there is no material available to conclude that such classification

has been made by administrative or executive action in the year 1981 as claimed by

the Petitioners.

Under these circumstances, I see no valid grounds to challenge the appointments of

the 4th and 5th respondents or the subsequent assignment of area of work to them. Both

of them had been appointed in the year 2012 based on the advertisement published in

the Gazette No 1,705 dated 06 May 2011. They had been attached to the Inquirer in to

sudden deaths division named Colombo General Hospital.

In fact the advertisement published in Gazette No 1,627 dated 06 November 2009

(R7) contain similarly named inquirer divisions in other Divisional Secretary

Divisions too. Bandaragama Government Hospital, Rikillagaskada Hospital,

Panadura General Hospital and Welikanda Hospitals are Inquirers in to Sudden

Deaths Divisions in Bandaragama, Hanguranketha, Panadura and Welikanda;

Divisional Secretariat Divisions, respectively.

In the year 2018, both the 4th and the 5th Respondents had been re-assigned to share

work in the Colombo City division along with the two Petitioners. According to the

2nd Respondent, prior to such re-assignment of duties, series of meetings had been

held with the participation of the Petitioners and 4th and 5th Respondents with regard

to the delays in holding inquests at Colombo National Hospital and the impugned

SC FR 230/2018

9

reassignment of duties was initiated with the objective of reducing delays by ensuring

that the Inquirers are not overburdened. Creating the geographical boundaries for a

particular division is a function that would depend on many factors such as the

workload and convenience of relevant stakeholders, including the general public. In

fact, section 108 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979, empowers

the Minster to appoint any person by name or office to be an inquirer for any area of

which the limits are specified in the appointment.

I further observe, that the Petitioners have moved this Court, to lay down guidelines

relating to the qualifications necessary for the appointment of the City of Colombo

Inquirer in to Sudden Deaths and an Additional City of Colombo Inquirer into Sudden

Deaths. However, the material placed before this Court through these proceedings in

my view is not sufficient for the Court to embark upon a process of such nature.

However, considering the content of the advertisements published calling for

applications for the post of Inquirers between the period 2001 to 2016, Court observes

that varying levels of education ie G.C.E (Ordinary Level), G.C.E (Advanced Level)

and Attorneys-at-Law have been stipulated as minimum qualifications required to be

possessed by the applicants. It is prudent and necessary to embark upon a proper

study having consulted all stakeholders who have the knowledge, experience,

expertise and an interest in this matter and thereafter formulate clear guidelines on the

experience and qualifications a person should possess to be appointed an Inquirer,

early. Petitioners as well as any other persons who have an interest in this matter

including the Bar Association of Sri Lanka could make their representations during

such a consultative process. Through such a transparent process a decision may be

made whether a classification should be made among the Inquirers depending on the

geographical area in which such duties are to be performed, provided such

classification can be made on intelligible criteria without acting arbitrarily.

Honourable Attorney-General, who is the 9th Respondent in this matter and who

represented several Respondents including the first three Respondents is directed to

bring these observations to the attention of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents for necessary

action.

In view of the foregoing findings, I am unable to hold that the rights guaranteed under

Article 12(1) to the petitioners or to any other person had been infringed Therefore, I

refuse to grant any relief as prayed for in the Petition. The application is, accordingly

dismissed.
