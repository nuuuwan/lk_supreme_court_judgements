However, as stated before, the stance of the Substituted Debtor Applicant appears to be that the proviso has a standalone effect and, as such if the debtor is in possession, there is no terminal date backwards and applications can be filed on deeds of transfer even though they were executed at the date of commencement of the original Ordinance.

Thus, the interpretation given by the Court of Appeal affects the substantive rights of the Vendees of aforesaid deeds executed between 17.09.1996 and 17.09.1999.
