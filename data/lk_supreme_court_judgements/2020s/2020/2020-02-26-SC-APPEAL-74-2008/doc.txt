Sisira J. de Abrew, J

In this case the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred

to as the Defendant-Respondent) did not respond to the summons issued by the

District Court and the learned District Judge by his order dated 22.5.2000 fixed the

case for exparte trial. The exparte trial was taken up on 13.7.2000 and the learned

District Judge by his judgment dated 13.7.2000 gave judgment in favour of the

Plaintiff. According to the Fiscal Report the decree was served on the Defendant-

Respondent on 8.8.2000. However, the Defendant-Respondent takes up the

position that he received the decree only on 19.8.2000. The learned District Judge

disbelieved the Defendant- Respondent and held that the decree was served on the

Defendant-Respondent on 8.8.2000. The Defendant-Respondent, on 30.8.2000,

filed an application to purge the default. The learned District Judge after inquiry by

his order dated 3.4.2002 refused the said application to purge the default. Being

aggrieved by the said order of the learned District Judge dated 3.4.2002, the

Defendant- Respondent appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court and the learned

Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court by their judgment dated 8.5.2008 set

aside the order of the learned District Judge dated 3.4.2002 and allowed the

Defendant-Respondent to file the answer. The learned Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court in their said judgment further directed the learned District

Judge to conduct trial and deliver judgment after taking steps in terms of Civil

Procedure Code. In effect the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court in

their said judgment have set aside the ex parte judgment of the learned District

Judge dated 13.7.2000. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Civil

Appellate High Court, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the Plaintiff-Appellant) has appealed to this court. This court by its

SC Appeal 74/2008

4

order dated 5.9.2008 granted leave to appeal on questions of law set out in

paragraphs 25(g) of the Petition of Appeal dated 11.6.2008. Learned counsel for

the Plaintiff-Appellant at the hearing of this appeal confined himself to the

question of law set out in paragraph 25(g) of the said Petition of Appeal which

reads as follows.

“In all the circumstances of the case whether the judgment of the Central

Provincial High Court of Appeal of Kandy dated 8.5.2008 is liable to be set aside

by Your Lordships’ Court.”

At the inquiry before the learned District Judge relating to the application to purge

the default, the Defendant-Respondent stated in evidence that the decree was

served on him only on 19.8.2000. But Modara Archchige Wilbert who is the

Process Server stated in evidence that he served the decree on the Defendant-

Respondent on 8.8.2000. When the learned District Judge by his order dated

3.4.2002 refused the application to purge the default, the Defendant-Respondent

filed a petition of appeal in the Civil Appellate High Court against the said order

dated 3.4.2002 but not against the exparte judgment of the learned District Judge

dated 13.7.2000. It has to be noted here that there was no appeal before the Civil

Appellate High Court seeking to set aside the ex parte judgment of the learned

District Judge dated 13.7.2000. In fact, the notice of appeal filed by the Defendant-

Respondent dated 10.4.2002 in the Civil Appellate High Court states that the

Defendant-Respondent seeks to set aside the order of the learned District Judge

dated 3.4.2002. In the Petition of Appeal filed in the Civil Appellate High Court

by the Defendant-Respondent dated 30.5.2002, the Defendant-Respondent seeks to

set aside order of the learned District Judge dated 4.4.2002 (this date appears to be

a typographical mistake- it should be 3.4.2002). The Defendant-Respondent in the

said Petition of Appeal does not seek to set aside the exparte judgment of the

SC Appeal 74/2008

5

learned District Judge dated 13.7.2000. But the learned Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court have set aside the ex parte judgment of the learned District

Judge dated 13.7.2000.

Learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Appellant submitted that learned Judges of the

Civil Appellate High Court did not have power to set aside the exparte judgment of

the learned District Judge dated 13.7.2000 especially when the Defendant-

Respondent had not sought such a relief. He further submitted that under Section

88(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, there could not be an appeal against any

judgment entered upon default.

Section 88(1) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows.

“No appeal shall lie against any judgment entered upon any default.”

Learned counsel for the Defendant-Respondent submitted that the Judges of the

Civil Appellate High Court have the power to set aside the judgment of the learned

District Judge dated 13.7.2000 in terms of Section 753 and 839 of the Civil

Procedure Code even though there is no appeal. The most important question that

must be decided in this case is whether the Civil Appellate High Court had the

power to set aside the exparte judgment of the learned District Judge dated

13.7.2000 when the Defendant-Respondent filed an appeal against the order of the

learned District Judge refusing the application to purge the default and when there

was no appeal against the exparte judgment of the learned District Judge. I now

advert to this question. In this connection it is relevant to consider the judgment in

the case of Sirimavo Bandaranayake Vs Times of Ceylon [1995] 1 SLR 22. In the

said case this court observed the following facts.

“The Times of Ceylon Limited (defendant-respondent) published several

newspapers including the Times of Ceylon. On 2.8.1977 the business

SC Appeal 74/2008

6

undertaking of the defendant having its registered office, 3 Bristol Street,

Fort, was vested in the Government under and in terms of the Business

Undertakings (Acquisition) Act, No. 35 of 1971 and a Competent Authority

was appointed under that Act to administer the business undertaking. The

Sunday Times of 4.12.77 reported that Mr. E. L. Senanayake then Minister

Agriculture and Lands had stated that the plaintiff respondent (the plaintiff)

had revalued her lands in order to obtain enhanced compensation from the

Land Reform Commission.

On 18.9.1978 the plaintiff filed action in the District Court of Colombo

against the defendant alleging that this and a related statement were

defamatory of her, The Government takeover was not disclosed. The

defendant did not appear on the summons returnable date (17.11.78) and ex

parte trial was fixed for 10. 1.79. On 10.1.79 witness Dr. K. L. V.

Alagiyawanna gave evidence and produced the Sunday Times of 4.12.77 but

neither did he say that the defendant published nor did he mention that the

Government had taken over the defendant's undertaking. The name of the

printer and publisher was stated in newspaper marked in evidence as

“printed and published by the Competent Authority, Republic of Sri Lanka

successor to the business undertaking of Times of Ceylon Ltd...” However

the trial judge entered judgment against the defendant on 29.1.79. On

17.4.79 the draft decree was tendered to the District Court and signed.

There was no journal entry that the copy of the decree was served on the

defendant. On 29.12.80 the plaintiff applied for execution. The Court

ordered notice on the defendant and the Fiscal reported on 13.2.81 there

was no such establishment. Notice was re-issued and a copy was sent to the

SC Appeal 74/2008

7

Competent Authority. The Fiscal reported on 17.3.81 that notice was pasted

on the front door of the building of Times of Ceylon Ltd. and also served on

the defendant at No. 9, Castle Street, Borella. The defendant filed objections

stating that no summons or decree was served and praying that proceedings

be set aside and that permission to file answer and defend the action be

allowed. On 12.3.82 the Court upheld the objections and set aside the ex

parte judgment and decree and ordered summons to re-issue on the

defendant. This order was affirmed by the Court of Appeal on 13.8.82. On

appeal to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal and set

aside the orders of the District Court and Court of Appeal by the judgment

reported in (1984) 1 Sri LR 178. Thereupon on 18.4.84 the defendant

applied to the Court for revision of the ex parte judgment. The Court of

Appeal by its judgment delivered on 11.12.90 held that the defendant had

nothing to do with the impugned publication and there had been a failure of

justice and set aside the judgment and dismissed plaintiff's action. In the

meantime plaintiff had recovered the sum of Rs. 750,000/- from the

defendant. The Court of Appeal ordered the plaintiff to repay this sum to the

defendant but refused defendant's claim for interest. Leave to appeal to the

Supreme Court was granted on the following questions.

1. Whether the remedy of revision is available in law to the (defendant)

having regard to all the facts and circumstances of this case?

2. Whether the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to revise the order of the

learned District Judge entering judgment ex parte in favour of the plaintiff,

which order (it is claimed) had been restored by the Supreme Court and had

become res adjudicata between the parties?”

This court held as follows

SC Appeal 74/2008

8

1. Judgment had been entered when there was not a scrap of evidence that

defendant was responsible for the defamatory publication and no finding

had been made on the question of publication.

2. The plaintiff's lawyers, unfortunately, failed to tell the trial judge that the

defendant was not responsible for the impugned publication, despite their

duty to court (now stated in Rule 51 of the Supreme Court (Conduct of and

Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law) Rules 1988) not to mislead or deceive or

permit a client to mislead or deceive in any way the Court before which they

appear.

3. The decision of the Supreme Court of 1.2.84 had the effect of restoring the ex

parte judgment, but the Supreme Court did not expressly affirm or approve

the judgment. None of the Courts considered the legality or propriety of the

judgment.

4. Even in an ex parte trial, the judge must act according to law and ensure that

the relief claimed is due in fact and in law, and must dismiss the plaintiff's

claim if he is not entitled to it. An ex parte judgment cannot be entered

without a hearing and an adjudication.

5. The revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in Article 138 of the

Constitution extends to reversing or varying an ex parte judgment against

the defendant upon default of appearance on the ground of manifest error or

perversity or the like. A default judgment can be canvassed on the merits, in

the Court of Appeal in revision, though not in appeal and not in the District

Court itself.

6. The judgment of the Supreme Court holding that the defendant had failed to

purge its default does not amount to an affirmation of such ex parte

SC Appeal 74/2008

9

judgment, so as to preclude the exercise by the Court of Appeal of its

revisionary jurisdiction.

7. Section 85(1) requires that the trial judge should be 'satisfied' that the

plaintiff is entitled to the relief claimed. He must reach findings on the

relevant points after a process of hearing and adjudication. This is

necessary where less than the relief claimed can be awarded if the Judge's

opinion is that the entirety of the relief claimed cannot be granted. Further,

sections 84, 86 and 87 all refer to the judge being 'satisfied' on a variety of

matters in every instance; such satisfaction is after adjudication upon

evidence.

8. Section 88 must be read with section 753 of the CPC. The fact that. section

88(1) bars an appeal against an ex parte default judgment restricts the right

of appeal conferred by section 754 of the CPC but does not affect the

revisionary jurisdiction by section 753, if anything it confirms that

jurisdiction. From the fact that section 88(2) confers a right of appeal, one

cannot, possibly infer am exclusion of revisionary jurisdiction on the same

matter.

9. Insofar as a remedy in the District Court is concerned the general rule is

that judge is functus officio and cannot review its own judgment However,

section 86 makes an exception, by conferring jurisdiction on the District

Court to set aside a default judgment if it was flawed in procedural respects

- but not on the merits. The necessary implication of the grant of that

jurisdiction is that the District Court is not competent to review a default

judgment on the merits. There are two distinct issues. The first is whether

the ex parte default judgment was procedurally proper and this depends on

whether a condition precedent had been satisfied namely whether a proper

SC Appeal 74/2008

10

order for ex parte trial had been made and whether the defendant had failed

to purge his default. The second is whether, apart from that default, the ex

parte default judgment was on the merits i.e. in respect of its substance,

vitiated by lack of jurisdiction, error and the like.”

It is therefore seen that in the above case that the Defendant filed objection stating

that no summons was served on him and prayed that the proceedings be set aside;

that the District Court upheld the objection which was affirmed by the Court of

Appeal; that this court set aside both orders of the District Court and the Court of

Appeal; that thereafter the defendant applied to this court for a revision of the ex

parte judgment; and that it is in the said revision application that court made the

above decision. But in the present case there is no appeal or revision application

filed against the ex parte judgment of the learned District Judge. Therefore, it is

wrong for the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court to base their

judgment on the judgment in the case of Sirimavo Bandaranayake Vs Times of

Ceylon (supra) and set aside the ex parte judgment of the learned District Judge

dated 13.7.2000. I note that in the present case, there is no appeal or revision

application filed in the Civil Appellate High Court challenging the legality of the

exparte judgment of the learned District Judge dated 13.7.2000.

In my view, the Defendant-Respondent was not successful in his application to

purge the default since the Defendant-Respondent has failed to come to the District

Court to purge the default within 14 days of the service of the decree. If the

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court is accepted as correct, it would help

the defaulting party (Defendant-Respondent) to set aside the ex parte judgment

against which he has not appealed. When I consider the aforementioned matters, I

am unable to accept the contention of learned counsel for the Defendant-

SC Appeal 74/2008

11

Respondent that the court has power to intervene in this case under Section 753

and 839 of the Civil Procedure Code.

A party cannot be permitted to succeed in a matter where there is no appeal or

application to revise an ex parte judgment. Considering all the above matters, I

hold that the Civil Appellate High Court has no power to set aside an ex parte

judgment of the District Court in an appeal filed against an order of District Court

refusing the application to purge the default.

I would like to state that in an ex parte trial the plaintiff is not always entitled to the

judgment in his favour on the basis that the defendant is absent. In an ex parte trial

too, plaintiff must prove his case on a balance of probability. It is the duty of the

trial Judge to consider whether the plaintiff has proved his case even in an ex parte

trial and if he fails to do so, it is the duty of the trial Judge to dismiss the plaintiff’s

case. Considering all the aforementioned matters, I answer the above question of

law in the affirmative. Accordingly, I set aside the judgment of the Civil Appellate

High Court dated 8.5.2008 and affirm the order of the learned District Judge dated

3.4.2002.
