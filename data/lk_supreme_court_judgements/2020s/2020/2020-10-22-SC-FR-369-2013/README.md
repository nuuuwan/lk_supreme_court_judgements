SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 3 of 16

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

Nandasenage Lalantha Anurdha Nandasena (Hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Petitioner) claims that he was arrested on the 25th of September 2013 by

the 2nd and 3rd Respondent. He states that thereafter he was hung on the rear door

of the police jeep and assaulted by the 3rd Respondent, 4th Respondent and 4 other

police Officers. The assault resulted in a fracture of his left hand and losing

consciousness. When the Petitioner subsequently regained consciousness he noticed

that he was at a Ayurvedic centre in Wijayapura. Thereafter he was taken to the

Anuradhapura Police Station and was kept in a room adjacent to the Crime Branch.

The Petitioner states that while detained in the police station, he was subjected to

torture by police officers attached to the Anuradhapura Police Station including the

1st – 4th Respondents (1st Respondent is the Headquarter Inspector of Police of the

Anuradhapura Police station, 2nd Respondent is the OIC – Crime Branch of the

Anuradhapura Police station, 3rd Respondent is a Sub- inspector of the Anuradhapura

Police station and the 4th Respondent is a Police Constable of the Anuradhapura

police station.) The Petitioner states that on the following day (26/09/2013) he was

taken out of the Police station by several police officers including the 2nd, 3rd and 4th

Respondents. The Petitioner was put into a police jeep to set out allegedly to recover

the stolen goods. While in the police jeep the 2nd Respondent had taken out his

revolver and threatened to shoot the Petitioner if he reveals any information about

the assault by them and further threatened to arrest relatives of the Petitioner if he

speaks to them of said assault. The Petitioner was produced before the Magistrate

Court of Anuradhapura on the 27th of September 2013 in Case No. B2797/2013.

The Respondents, particularly the 2nd and 3rd Respondent maintain that the

Petitioner was arrested on the 26th of September by the 2nd Respondent. The

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 16

Respondents further state that a complaint was made by one Magal Bandalage

Gunasena on 24/08/2013 to the Anuradhapura police station stating that his house

was broken into, while he and his family members were away and gold jewelry worth

Rs. 120, 000/- was stolen. After an investigation, the Petitioner and two others were

arrested on 26/09/2013 in connection with the theft. The Respondents maintain that

as the jeep approached the main road from the junction while taking the suspects by

jeep to the police station due to a steep incline the wheels skidded and this resulted

in the rear doors of the jeep springing open. The Respondents assert that the

Petitioner in his attempt to escape in that moment jumped out and tripped, landing

heavily on his left shoulder thereby injuring himself and deny the use of any force.

The Counsel for the Petitioner informed court that he will be confining this

Application to Article 11, namely torture.

The pleadings and submissions before us establish the facts that are set out

below which are pertinent to this case.

While both parties acknowledge the arrest and injury on the petitioner’s left

shoulder, they have opposing views on how the aforementioned injury occurred. The

Petitioner submits that he was arrested on the 25th of September and that he was not

informed of the reasons for his arrest. He further states that he was tied up and hung

on the rear door of the jeep and assaulted as a result of which he broke his left arm.

The Petitioner was arrested in the Nelumkulama area and was taken to an indigenous

Ayurvedic medical practitioner (Vedha mahaththaya) at Wijayapura. Taking into

consideration the place the petitioner was arrested and the area where the ayurvedic

dispensary is located, it seems that the police vehicle in which the Petitioner was

taken for treatment travelled passing the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital.

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 16

The Petitioner states that he was produced before the Magistrate Court of

Anuradhapura on the 27/09/2013 and at that time his Attorney – at – Law informed

court that he had been assaulted by the police. The learned Magistrate cancelled the

identification parade and directed that the Petitioner be admitted to the

Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital for treatment. The Petitioner states that Magistrate

called for a report regarding the assault however the Respondents though accepting

that the Magistrate Court cancelled the identification parade and directed the

Petitioner to be admitted at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, they deny that a

report was called for. The Petitioner was subsequently admitted to the Anuradhapura

Teaching Hospital and he was released without being subjected to a medico legal

examination by the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) of the Anuradhapura Teaching

Hospital.

It is evident from the information submitted to this Court by the Respondents

that the police officers made entries in the relevant information books that the

Petitioner received his injuries as a result of his attempt to escape. It is also further

revealed that he was taken to an Ayurvedic medical practitioner.

When the Petitioner was admitted to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, he

had informed the doctors including the consultant of his assault by the police and

they had made entries in the Bed Head Ticket (BHT). As there is no Medico Legal

Report (MLR) available to us, I carefully perused the BHT and observed the following

injuries; swelling, fracture of the left humerus and left wrist drop.

The Respondents submit that the petition and affidavit bear incorrect dates.

According to the petition and affidavit the date mentioned is the 24th of September

2013. I perused the said petition and affidavit and find that to be correct but I

observed that the affidavit was sworn by the Petitioner in front of the jailer of the

Anuradhapura prison. He said that the affidavit was affirmed on 10/10/2013 and it

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 16

was filed before the Supreme Court on the 24/10/2013. Considering the nature of

this allegation I am inclined to give the Petitioner the benefit of the doubt. I presume

that the affidavit was signed on the 10/10/2013. The dates mentioned in the petition

and affidavit maybe a typographical error as claimed by the counsel for the

Petitioner.

If we were to hypothetically accept the Respondents’ version of events that

the Petitioner fell off the jeep while he was trying to escape, then why did the

Respondents fail to produce the Petitioner to the government hospital which they

are bound to do by law.

There is no material submitted before this Court that the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents have reported this matter to the higher authorities of the Police

Department, namely the ASP and higher. The two main factors namely the escape

and the injury must be brought to the attention of the higher officials (at least up to

the Divisional SSP). There are a number of Departmental Orders and circulars that

set out the proper manner and procedure on how a person in police custody must

be treated. The relevant provisions for this matter from the Departmental Order

Bearing No. A 20, the Departmental order bearing No. E 6 and the IG circular No.

2328/2011 will be reproduced for ease of reference.

Departmental Order Bearing No. A 20 states as follows;

Responsibilities of Police and the rights of the persons under arrest-

Every police officer should keep in mind that a person who is under the

custody of police is not in the state of a prisoner convicted and his

protection should be considered in every aspect. If a person being held in

the police custody made a special request on: food or bed and seat etc. special

attention should be paid on such a request and the instructions of the Duty

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 16

officer should be sought in that regard. The Duty Officer shall facilitate such

amenities unless it causes a prejudice to the custody.

2. A. - Arrest: when a person is arrested it should be done without the acts

of violence as much as possible. In a case of arresting a violent person the

police powers should be used only to the extent it is required to suppress powers.

(Emphasis added)

Departmental Order Bearing No. E 6 sets out the procedure to be followed by the

police when a prisoner escapes from the custody of the police. This same procedure

is applicable where a suspect attempts to escape from the custody of the police. It

states as follows;

2. At every occasion when a prisoner escapes, such should be informed to

the Assistant Superintendent of Police, Superintendent of Police and to

the information room of the Headquarters through a telephone call or

email along with a complete description of the person or persons who have

escaped.

5. If an escaped accused is taken in to the custody of the Police and when he is

taken into custody, it should be informed to all who had been informed

earlier that he is taken back to the custody of the police.

(Emphasis added)

The IG circular No. 2328/2011 sets out the manner in which the suspects who are

under the custody of the police should be protected. This circular states as follows;

02. in making an arrest of a suspect, the police should comply with Section 23 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and whereas –

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 16

IV. When an arrested person has injuries, he should be referred to a

Judicial Medical Officer and a report should be obtained thereby. If the

suspect does not hesitate to provide a statement, a statement should be taken

over the injuries.

X. The said telephone message should be inclusive of: the place, time in which

the suspect is arrested, the reason for the arrest, and details which describe

whether special incidents happened when the suspect is arrested. When

such a telephone message is received, the Gazetted Officer in charge of the

District shall promptly ascertain the information of the said arrest from the

relevant police station whereas the said officer should provide all the

instructions required over the further investigation of the suspect and producing

him to the courts to the Officer -in- Charge and the Investigation Officer. When

it is felt that the arrested suspect should have to be examined, he should visit

the relevant Police Station and instructions required for examining the suspect

and for the investigations should be provided.

XI. All the Officers- in - Charge are liable to work in a manner which

ensure the rights and protection of all persons who are being arrested.

The officers in charge of the District who are monitoring such places

should strictly monitor the rights and protection of the people who are

under arrest.

03.

III. All records of moving the suspect to another place should be duly noted in

the information book

04. It shall be the duty of all the officers in charge of the Districts cum Divisions

and the Deputy Inspector Generals who are in charge of Ranges to execute

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 16

constant monitoring process as to whether the said instructions are properly

carried in to effect and rights of the arrested suspects are properly ensured.

(Emphasis added)

Thus, on examination of the aforementioned provisions it is evident that the

Respondents involved in this matter had not complied with the necessary procedure

as set out above. It is also unheard of that when a person is injured when trying to

escape from the police custody for him to be taken to an ayurvedic medical physician

to be treated.

In the given circumstances as per the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15

of 1979 the police officer is compelled to produce him before a Government Medical

Officer and must obtain a report (MLR) and submit the same to the Magistrate and

the recoveries made by the police officer must be checked and itemized.

When taking into comparison the duties and responsibilities of the Petitioner

and the Respondent Police Officers, it is evident that the petitioner is just an ordinary

citizen of the country. However, the Respondents as police officers are expected by

virtue of the colour of their uniform to be more accountable in their duty than an

ordinary citizen of the country. A police officer is a repository of State duties, who

has been prescribed with law enforcement duties. When a fundamental rights

application of this nature is filed, Court expects reasonable explanation with

documents and evidence and not just a mere denial. A denial in itself will not suffice.

In the case of Ansalin Fernando v Sarath Perera, Officer – In – Charge, Police

Station Chilaw and Others [(1992) SLR Vol. 2 411) Kulatunga J stated as follows;

I do not consider it proper to reject such an allegation merely because the

police deny it or because the aggrieved party cannot produce medical evidence

of injuries. Whether any particular treatment is violative of Article 11 of the

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 16

Constitution would depend on the facts of each case. The allegation can be

established even in the absence of medically supported injuries.

The mission of the Sri Lanka Police Department reads as “Sri Lanka police is

committed and confident to uphold and enforce the law of the land, to preserve the

public order, prevent crime and terrorism with prejudice to none – equity to all” equity

generally means what is fair and just, moral and ethical. Consequently, it can be

stated that by committing acts that constitute acts of torture a police officer would

be acting against the mission and vision on which the Sri Lanka Police was founded.

Additionally, he or she would also be acting beyond the colours of his or her uniform.

Article 1 of The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or

Degrading Treatment or Punishment defines torture as follows;

For the purposes of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by

which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally

inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third

person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third

person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating

or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on

discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at

the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or

other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or

suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.

The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading

Treatment or Punishment Act No.22 of 1994 defines torture as follows;

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 16

Section 12 -

“torture” with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means any act

which causes severe pain, whether physical or mental, to any other person, being an

act, which is;

(a) done for any of the following purposes that is to say

(i) obtaining from such other person or a third person, any information or

confession; or

(ii) punishing such other person for any act which he or a third person has

committed or is suspected of having committed; or

(iii) intimidating or coercing such other person or a third person; or

(b) done for any reason based on discrimination,

and being in every case, an act which is done by, or at the initiation of, or with

the consent or acquiescence of, a public officer or other person acting in an

official capacity.

Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides for the

protection of persons from torture. It states that No one shall be subjected to torture

or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

The right to freedom from torture is enshrined in various human rights

instruments and protects all individuals from being intentionally subjected to severe

physical or psychological distress by, or with the approval or acquiescence of,

government agents acting for a specific purpose, including to inflict punishment or

to obtain information. Torture is a crime under international law. According to the

relevant instruments it is prohibited and it cannot be justified under any

circumstances. The right to freedom from torture is one of the most universally

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 16

recognized human rights and as such the protection from torture has attained status

as a jus cogens. Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne in his book Fundamental Rights in Sri

Lanka (1996, at page 114) writes that the intentional and wanton infliction of pain

and suffering is one of the most shameful acts that one human can perpetrate on

another. Torture is one of the vilest acts perpetrated by human beings on their fellow

creatures. It annihilates human personality and denies the inherent dignity of a

human being and should not be condoned under any circumstances.

Article 11 of our Constitution guarantees that no person shall be subjected to torture

or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. This is an unqualified

non – derogable right and every person is entitled to it. This unqualified nature of the

right and the fact that this provision is entrenched makes it abundantly clear that the

Constitution envisages ‘zero tolerance’ towards cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment which is the anti-thesis of ‘Human Dignity’.

In the case of Amal Sudath Silva v Kodituwakku Inspector of Police and

Others [(1987) Vol. 2 SLR 119] Atukorale J stated as follws;

“Article 11 of our Constitution mandates that no person shall be subjected to

torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It prohibits

every person from inflicting torture some, cruel or inhuman treatment on

another. It is an absolute fundamental right subject to no restrictions or

limitations whatsoever. Every person in this country, be he a criminal or not, is

entitled to this right to the fullest content of its guarantee. Constitutional

safeguards are generally directed against the State and its organs. The police

force being an organ of the State is enjoined by the Constitution to secure and

advance this right and not to deny, abridge or restrict the same in any manner

and under any circumstances. Just as much as this right is enjoyed by every

member of the police force, so is he prohibited from denying the same to others,

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 16

irrespective of their standing, their beliefs or antecedents. It is therefore the duty

of this court to protect and defend this right jealously to its, fullest measure with

a view to ensuring that this right which is declared and intended to be

fundamental is always kept fundamental and that the executive by its action

does not reduce it to a mere illusion. This court cannot, in the discharge of its

constitutional duty, countenance any attempt by, any police officer however high

or low, to conceal or distort the truth induced perhaps, by a false sense of police

solidarity. The facts of this case have revealed disturbing features regarding third

degree methods adopted by certain police officers on suspects held in police

custody. Such methods can, only be described as barbaric, savage and inhuman.

They are most revolting to one's sense of human decency and dignity particularly

at the present time when every endeavor is being made to promote and protect

human rights. Nothing shocks the conscience of a man so much as the cowardly

act of a delinquent police officer who subjects a helpless suspect in his charge to

depraved and barbarous methods of treatment within the confines of the very

premises in which he is held in custody. Such action on the part of the police will

only breed contempt for the law and will tend to make the public lose confidence

in the ability of the police to maintain law and order. The petitioner may be a

hard-core criminal whose tribe deserve no sympathy. But if constitutional

guarantees are to have any meaning or value in our democratic set up, it is

essential that he be not denied the protection guaranteed by our Constitution”

In Velmurugu v Attorney General and Another [(1981) Vol. 1 SLR 406] it

was held that;

Article 11 which gives protection from torture and ill-treatment is the only

fundamental right that is entrenched in the Constitution in the sense that an

amendment of this clause would need not only a two-third majority but also

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 16

a Referendum. It is also the only right in the catalogue of rights set out

in Chapter III that is of equal application to everybody and which in

no way can be restricted or diminished. This right occupies a preferred

position and it is the duty of this court to give it full play and to see

that its provisions enjoy the maximum application.

(Emphasis added)

In the case of Bandula Samarasekara v Vijith Alwis, OIC Ginigathhena

Police Station and Others [(2009) Vol. 1 SLR 213] Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake

stated as follows;

"It is the duty of a police officer to use his best endeavour and ability to

prevent all crimes, offences and public nuisances and more importantly to

preserve the peace. In order to carry out his duties efficiently and

effectively, it would be necessary to have the trust and respect of the

public. It is not easy to command that from the public and in order to earn

such trust and respect, the police officers must possess a higher standard of

moral and ethical values than is expected from an average person.

In Senthilnayagam and Others v Seneviratne and Another [(1981)

Vol. 2 SLR 187] Justice Colin Thome noted that;

“The Courts have been jealous of any infringement of personal liberty and

care is not to be exercised less vigilantly, because the subject whose liberty

is in question may not be particularly meritorious”

In the Indian case of State of Uttar Pradesh vs Ram Sagar Yadav and

others (1985 AIR 416) it was held;

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 16

“It is necessary that the Government amends the law appropriately so that

policemen who commit atrocities on persons who are in their

custody are not allowed to escape by reason of paucity or absence of

evidence. Police Officers alone and none else can give evidence as regards

the circumstances in which a person in their custody comes to receive

injuries while in their custody. Bound by ties of a kind of brotherhood, they

often prefer to remain silent in such situations and when they choose to

speak they put their own glass upon facts and pervert the truth. The result

is that persons, on whom atrocities are perpetrated by the police in

the sanctum sanctorum of the Police Station, are left without

evidence to prove who the offenders are. The law as to the burden of

proof in such cases may be re-examined by the legislature so that

hand-maids of law and order do not use their authority and

opportunities for oppressing the Innocent citizens, who look to them

for protection.”

(Emphasis added)

It must also be noted that when this application initially came before this

court the Attorney general appeared for all the Respondents however once

leave to proceed was granted the Attorney general did not appear for the 2nd

and 3rd Respondents.

Considering the available material, I find the complaint made by the

Applicant to be factual, that he was subject to torture at the hands of the 2nd

and 3rd Respondent. Therefore, I find that the right of the Applicant enshrined

under Article 11 of the Constitution was violated.

There are several cases decided by this court time and time again that

declare that the state should take strict measures to prevent abuse of authority

SC FR 369/2013 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 16

by government officials, especially the police but there is no report or action

plan before this court that the government has taken adequate measure to curb

these situations from arising continuously.

I find the Fundamental Right of the Applicant enshrined in Article 11 of

the Constitution to have been violated by the 2nd, 3rd Respondents and the

State. Hence, I order the 2nd and 3rd respondents to pay Rs. 50,000/- each from

their personal funds and the 5th respondent to pay compensation amounting to

Rs. 100,000/- to the Applicant, Nandasenage Lalantha Anurdha Nandasena.
