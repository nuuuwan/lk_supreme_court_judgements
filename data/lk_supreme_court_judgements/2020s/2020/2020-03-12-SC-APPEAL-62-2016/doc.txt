The Plaintiff - Respondent - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Plaintiff) filed plaint in the District Court of Colombo seeking to recover

damages for the wrongful detention by Sri Lanka Customs, 96 bales of fabric,

which the Plaintiffs had imported. The Plaintiff in the said plaint had alleged

that the Sri Lanka Customs had wrongfully seized the said items on 15-07-

1988 and continued to keep them in detention until the Plaintiff filed a writ

application in the Court of Appeal seeking a writ of Mandamus to compel the

Sri Lanka Customs to act in terms of law. The Plaintiff has further stated in

his plaint that in the course of the proceedings of the said case (C A writ

application No. 159/2000) in the Court of Appeal, the parties had agreed to

settle the matter on the terms and conditions set out in the motion dated

25-09-2000. Accordingly, the Sri Lanka Customs had released the 96 bales

of fabric to the Plaintiff on 23-02-2001. It is the complaint of the Plaintiff

that the Sri Lanka Customs had breached its legal duty either to hold an

inquiry into the matter if it had taken the view that the Plaintiff had violated

any law or to release the said consignment upon payment of due customs

4

levies. The Plaintiff has further stated in the plaint that he was compelled to

dispose the said 96 bales of fabric (after their release) at a low price, which

had incurred a loss to him.

The Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Defendant) filed its answer stating that the detention of the relevant

goods was an official act by the officers of the Sri Lanka Customs and

therefore the Plaintiff is not entitled to claim any damages from the

Defendant. The Defendant had further stated that it is not open for the

Plaintiff to maintain this action as the matter was settled in the Court of

appeal. The Defendant had prayed that the plaint be dismissed.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge delivered the

judgment dated 22-07-2009 in favour of the Plaintiff holding that the Plaintiff

is entitled to recover the damages.

The Defendant being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned District

Judge has filed an application for revision in the Provincial High Court

canvassing the said judgment.

At the conclusion of the argument of the said revision application, the

Provincial High Court, having considered the material, by its order dated 23-

5

08-2012 has dismissed the said revision application on the basis that there

are no exceptional circumstances to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction of

Court as the judgment under challenge was an appealable one.

This Court, when the leave to appeal application pertaining to the instant

appeal was supported, having heard the submissions of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General for the Defendant and the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff,

by its order dated 15-03-2016, has granted leave to appeal in respect of the

following questions of law.

1) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law by failing

to consider the legal effect and the spirit of the settlement between

the parties before a Court of law, especially the settlement before the

Court of Appeal?

2) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law by

deciding that the detention of the fabric is a statutory power exercised

by the customs officers under the Customs Ordinance and thus the

officers are protected against claims for damages?

3) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law by not

considering that the Plaintiff - Respondents had not availed itself of

6

the statutory relief available in the Customs Ordinance to obtain

damages and the aforesaid District Court action for damages was in

contravention of the Customs Ordinance?

4) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law by not

considering that the Plaintiff - Respondent’s action for damages was

prescribed under the Customs Ordinance?

5) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law by failing

to consider that the total disregard of the settlement entered into by

the learned District Court judge would in fact amount to exerting

supervisory jurisdiction over the Court of Appeal?

6) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law by failing

to appreciate that the Civil Appellate High Court exercises its

revisionary jurisdiction in the interests of due administration of justice?

Perusal of the impugned order of the Provincial High Court clearly shows

that the learned Judges of the High Court had not considered merits of the

case. The sole question they had considered is the question whether there

are any exceptional circumstances which warrant their intevention in the

matter to exercise their revisionary powers. Therefore, one does not find

7

any decision made by the Provincial High Court on the questions of law set

out in questions of law No’s 1-5. I am therefore of the view that the said

questions of law are misconceived. Further, this Court is not in a position to

decide whether the Provincial High Court has erred in its decision on the

said points as it has in fact not adjudicated on any of them.

As has also been pointed out by the Petitioner in his written submissions1,

the primary question this Court has to resolve at the outset is whether in

the given circumstances, there are any exceptional circumstances, which

warrant the intervention of the Court at the stage of the said revision

application. Although not clear enough, question of law No. 6 appear to be

on that line.

The learned Additional Solicitor General in the course of his submissions

conceded that it is imperative on the Defendant to show the existence of

exceptional circumstances before the Provincial High Court. It was his

submission that the exceptional circumstances relied upon by the Defendant

were set out in paragraph 4 of the revision application filed before the

1 Paragraphs 28-35 of the written submissions of the Petitioner.

8

Provincial High Court. Thus, I would reproduce the said paragraph 4 below.

It is as follows.

“ … Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Petitioner seek to invoke the

reversionary jurisdiction of Your Lordships Court on the following among

other exceptional circumstances that may be urged by the Counsel at the

hearing of this revision.

i. The Learned District Judge erred in determining that the "final and

conclusive" settlement entered by the parties in the Court of Appeal

cannot be considered as final and conclusive.

ii. The learned judge erred in determining that the District Court has

jurisdiction to determine the action of the Plaintiff.

iii. The learned District Judge erred in determining that the Plaintiff

Respondents cannot maintain an action for damages as the Customs

ofﬁcers detained the goods whilst exercising statutory powers under

the Customs ordinance.

iv. The learned District Judge erred in failing to consider that the Court of

Appeal had concluded that the Plaintiff Respondents attempted to

remove the 96 bales illegally.

9

v. The learned Judge has erred in determining that there was a delay in

releasing the goods.

vi. The learned Judge has erred in deciding that there is no evidence to

conclude that the settlement entered in to in the Court of Appeal case

no. 159/2000 is final and conclusive.

vii. The Learned Judge has erred in not considering that the Plaintiff

Respondents have not paid for the material to the buyer.

viii. The Learned Judge has failed to consider that the Plaintiff Respondents

are only entitled to CMT charges for the entire transaction.

ix. That the said judgement is contrary to law and against the weight of

the evidence presented during the case.

x. That the learned District Judge has erred in evaluating the evidence

led on behalf of the Defendant - Petitioner.

xi. The learned District Judge has erred in relying on the Defendant -

Petitioner’s evidence to prove the Plaintiff - Respondent’s case.

xii. The learned District Judge had given undue weight to the evidence of

the Plaintiff - Respondents and that of the evidence of the witnesses.

10

xiii. That the learned Judge has erred in evaluating the evidence relating

to the documents led at the trial and failed to evaluate the evidence

led by Defendant Petitioner in that regard.

xiv. The learned Judge has failed to give reasons.

xv. The learned Judge has disregarded/ misinterpreted the evidence led

on behalf of the Defendant - Petitioner.

xvi. The learned District Judge has failed to consider that the Plaintiff -

Respondents have not produced evidence on a balance of convenience

to prove the wrongful/ illegal acts of the Defendant - Petitioner.

xvii. The learned District Judge has failed to consider that the Plaintiff -

Respondents have not produced evidence on a balance of convenience

to prove damages and/or misdirected herself in calculating damages

or has awarded damages in excess than warranted in the case.

xviii. The learned District Judge has based the judgment on

extraneous and irrelevant facts. .. “

Learned Additional Solicitor General did not seek to controvert the fact that

the Defendant in fact had lodged an appeal against the judgment of the

District Court and that the said appeal was filed out of the time stipulated

11

by law. Further he also did not seek to controvert the finding by the

Provincial High Court that the Defendant has filed the revision application

after realizing that it cannot maintain the said appeal and that the grounds

it has pleaded in the revision application are the same as in the appeal it

had filed.

Grounds set out in the revision application by the Defendant are merely

grounds of appeal which are centered around the issues framed in the trial.

Our Courts have consistently held that the revisionary power of Courts is

an extraordinary power and that the Courts must exercise it only in

exceptional circumstances when the law has expressly provided the

aggrieved party a right of appeal.

The Defendant has had an alternative remedy available. In the instant

case, what the Provincial High Court was called upon to exercise was its

revisionary jurisdiction. The Defendant has not been successful in

convincing Court that the grounds he had urged have any exceptional

character which is sufficient to move Court to exercise its discretionary

revisionary power. Thus, this Court has no reason to disagree with the

conclusion of the Provincial High Court that there are no exceptional

circumstances to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court. In these

12

circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed

without costs.
