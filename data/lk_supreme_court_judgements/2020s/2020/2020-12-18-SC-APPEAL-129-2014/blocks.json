It must be noted that there is neither an averment in the plaint nor an issue raised in relation to the soil rights of the said path shown on the western boundary of P3 or of the purported roadway they claimed and, also no proof was adduced in establishing such soil rights. It should be also noted that no stance was taken by the Plaintiffs to indicate that the path shown in P3 on the western boundary or the purported roadway they claim was a public road that all members of the society including the Plaintiffs had access. Thus, it is clear that the action filed by the Plaintiffs is not based on soil rights or on an alleged right of the Plaintiffs to use a public roadway or on an alleged encroachment caused by the Defendants. As mentioned above, their cause of action was based on obstructions caused to a right of way and they prayed for a declaration of right of way by prescription and on necessity indicating that their claim was based on a servitutal right of way.

This evidence shows that the purported roadway claimed by the Plaintiffs was at least not in use during the last 10 to 15 years prior to the making of the said plan marked P1 in the manner shown by the Plaintiffs. Further, it indicates that the obstructions caused on 01.03.1993 by the Defendants as alleged in the plaint may not be the correct representation of facts since those trees would have been planted or allowed to be grown many years prior to that. The aforesaid surveyor in his evidence had stated, due to the trees mentioned above, it cannot be used as a road and a cart cannot be taken using that. However, the 3rd Plaintiff and the 2nd Plaintiff in their evidence had attempted to indicate that a cart road was used over the Defendants\u2019 land to bring cadjan leaves to thatch a house in their land evading the trees. This may be an afterthought due to the irreconcilability caused by the existing trees on the strip of land shown by them with their stance of user of 10 feet wide roadway till the alleged obstruction. On the other hand, these two plaintiffs were not consistent in this regard since as per the 3rd Plaintiff, last occasion a cart was so taken with Cadjan leaves was in 1979 or 1980 and thereafter they were taken through the playground while according to the 2nd plaintiff last occasion was in 1992. Other than the issue of reliability, this clearly indicates that even if it is true that they have not shown the definite track or the path they purportedly used as a cart road through plan marked P1 since it cannot be a straight strip of land as per the evidence given by the aforesaid Plaintiffs. Nevertheless, taking a cart with Cadjan leaves to thatch a house that may happen once within 12 to 18 months over the neighbour\u2019s land as per the evidence given cannot be considered as using permanent cart road adverse to the interests of the owner of the land. However, contrary to the position of using a cart road over the Defendants\u2019 land which is, as per the plaint, described in the second schedule to the plaint as well as lot B of plan marked as P3, to show the roadway, the Plaintiffs have taken another commission to superimpose plan marked P3 which indicates a path outside the aforesaid Defendants\u2019 land. It appears, as per the evidence led before the District Court, that the intention of producing this superimposed plan no 3465, marked as P2 at the trial, was to indicate how the path shown in P3 would position on the ground. The tendering of this superimposed plan does not reconcile with claiming a servitude over the Defendants\u2019 land because the roadway or path depicted in P3 is situated outside the Defendants\u2019 land. Further, it is contrary to the claim that a roadway was used",

As observed above, it must be said that, as per P3, there is no roadway within lot B but only as the boundary of lot B. Even the second schedule to the plaint indicates that roadway is the boundary and not a part of lot B. The aforesaid surveyor in his evidence has stated that he received a commission to superimpose P3 with P1 and his superimposition is satisfactory- vide pages 111 and 108 of the brief. However, in his evidence he did not give reasons to say as to why he found it satisfactory. He had not explained how many identified points in P3 plan tallied with the other plan. As per the evidence given by the 3rd Plaintiff, aforesaid surveyor only surveyed the road on the first occasion and after the second commission, surveyed plaintiffs\u2019 land but not the defendants\u2019 land \u2013 vide pages 142,143 and 144of the brief. Now it is important to observe what the surveyor has stated in his superimposition plan no. 3465 and its report marked as P2 and P2a respectively. Neither the notes on plan marked P2 nor the report marked P2a states that the surveyor superimposed P3 with the Plan no.2618 (P1) as per the commission issued. The notes on the P2 plan which describe the plan P2 states that he surveyed the Siyabalagahawatte claimed by the Defendants and superimposed it with lot A of Plan no. 5196 (P3). Ironically, the said note speaks of a superimposition of the Defendants\u2019 land with the Plaintiffs\u2019 land since lot A in P3 is the Plaintiffs\u2019 land. However, the report marked P2a states that he surveyed the plaintiffs\u2019 land and superimposed it with the corresponding lot A in P3. Nonetheless, the facts mentioned above establish that the notes on the superimposition plan marked P2 is contradictory to the contents of its report and, the superimposition plan and report does not show that it was prepared in compliance with the commission issued. As such, it is not proper to rely on the mere statement of the surveyor who made it, saying that it was a satisfactory superimposition. In the said report marked P2a the surveyor had stated the",

It may even be a path used by someone else to some other land since, as per P3, it does not seem to end at the Plaintiffs\u2019 land. However, the Plan marked V 2 and V2a indicates that there was no such path along the western boundary of the Plaintiffs\u2019 land when it was made in 1987. As per the said Plan, the western boundary is the Municipal Play Ground which belongs to the State. Even W J M G Dias, Licensed Surveyor had stated in evidence that he did not observe any sign indicating a roadway on the western boundary when he made that plan. Thus, it appears that the roadway claimed by the Plaintiffs were not in existence by 1987.

It must be observed that V1 was not a plan submitted by the Plaintiffs. It was the plan tendered by the Defendants to show the existence of an alternative roadway. Whether there is an alternative road is a matter of fact and the Learned District Judge who heard the evidence of the surveyor who made that plan had come to the conclusion that the Plaintiffs could use the said alternative roadway- vide answer to issue no 10 of the District Court Judgment. Neither the High Court nor this Court sitting in appeal is better equipped to decide on facts and nothing is there to decide that it was a perverse finding. However, towards the Plaintiffs\u2019 land the width of the said access is only 4 feet. The Plaintiffs claim is not related to the widening of the said access shown in V1 but a 10-feet right of way over the Defendants\u2019 land. The learned District Judge had observed in his Judgment that the Plaintiffs were not using any private vehicles and even as per the nature of their livelihood it is not apparent that they have any need to use a private vehicle. No evidence seems to have led to show that a fair need to take a vehicle regularly to the Plaintiffs\u2019 land had arisen. The Plaintiffs had",

    "text": "Limited V Cader (1986) 2 S L R 309 to indicate that tacit abandonment takes place where the servient owner is permitted to do something that necessarily obstructs or make inoperative the exercise of servitutal right. However, in the case at hand, purported servitude claimed by the plaintiffs is not one created by a deed, as such the proposition of law stated in the said case that, under our law, a servitude of right of way created by a notarial grant cannot be lost by non-user has no relevance. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs marked P1 plan to show the purported roadway they claim but the trees grown on the said roadway which are 10 to 15 years old as per the Plaintiffs\u2019 own witness itself is indicative of an abandonment that had taken place much before the purported obstruction alleged in the plaint. Anyhow, according to Roman Dutch Law, in order for the right to be abandoned, non-user or the abandonment of the right should be for a third of hundred years, i.e. 33 and 1/3 years- vide Dayawathie V Dias and others, The Bar Association Law Journal 2013 Vol. XX page 20. As per P3, lot A and lot B appears to be portions of one land named Siyambalagahawatte. There is no evidence to indicate that the path on the western boundary was part of the main land reserved as a road access to these two lots. No roadway is shown over the Lot B as an access road to Lot A. The Plaintiffs deed, as said before, does not indicate any right of way was reserved for Lot A, neither over Lot B nor over the said path on the west to the land. No evidence had been led to show when the original owner transferred Lot B to the predecessors of the Defendants, he reserved a right of way over Lot B for Lot A. Thus, if there was any right of way over Lot B, the abandonment would have taken place when those Lots were given to the predecessors of the parties. If one abandons his right of way, he cannot be allowed to claim it as a way of necessity again. However, even to consider abandonment, first there must be proof for that, at a given time in the past, there was a servitude of right of way over the Defendants\u2019 land which is lot B of P3. As said before, the path shown in P3 was not over the said lot B as such there was no proof to indicate that there was servitude of right of way over aforesaid lot B which has to be considered as the servient tenement.",
