Sisira J. de Abrew, J Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Respondent) filed this action inter alia seeking to get a declaration that the

Deed of Transfer No.2199 dated 18.9.1997 is null and void.

The learned District Judge by his judgment dated 26.10.2009 granted the above

relief claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said judgment

of the learned District Judge, the 2nd Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant

who is the son of the 1st Defendant appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court

Gampaha (hereinafter referred to as the Civil Appellate High Court). The learned

Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court by their judgment dated 17.12.2014,

affirmed the said judgment of the learned District Judge. Being aggrieved by the

said judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the 2nd Defendant-Appellant-

Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd Defendant-Appellant) has

appealed to this court. This court by its order dated 1.11.2016 granted leave to

appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs 14(b),(d) and (h) of the Petition of

Appeal dated 27.1.2015 which are set out below.

1. Whether the Respondent has failed to discharge the burden of proof to

vindicate her title?

2. Whether the learned District Judge and as well as the learned Judges of the

Civil Appellate High Court of Gampaha have erred in law by failing to

appreciate the fact that the Respondent has failed to rebut the evidence of the

Petitioner and as well as the Notary Public Mr. Crooz Morais who executed

the said Deed bearing No.2199?

3. Whether the learned District Judge and as well as the learned Judges of the

Civil Appellate High Court of Gampaha have erred in law by holding that

the Respondent is entitled for damages when there was no iota of evidence

SC Appeal 205/2016

placed before the court by the Respondent to that effect?

The 2nd Defendant-Appellant is the son of the 1st Defendant. The 2nd Defendant-

Appellant claims that his father had acquired title to the property in dispute by

Deed of Transfer No.2199 dated 18.9.1997 attested by AERC Moraes Notary

Public. The Plaintiff-Respondent claims that she acquired title to the property in

dispute by Deed of Gift No.27 dated 9.12.1997 attested by Ranjika P Navaratne

Notary Public. The Plaintiff-Respondent by his plaint seeks a declaration that Deed

of Transfer No.2199 dated 18.9.1997 is null and void. Learned counsel for the

Plaintiff-Respondent supported this position of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Learned

counsel for the 2nd Defendant-Appellant submitted that Deed of Gift No.27 dated

9.12.1997 is null and void. I now advert to the above submissions. The donor in

Deed of Gift No.27 dated 9.12.1997 is Sathasivam Achalingam and the vendor in

Deed of Transfer No.2199 dated 18.9.1997 is also Sathasivam Achalingam.

Sathasivam Achalingam on 14.7.1998 has made a statement to the police

(produced as X5) to the effect that he, by Deed of Gift No.27 dated 9.12.1997

attested by Ranjika P Navaratne Notary Public, gifted the property in dispute to the

Plaintiff-Respondent. He has further stated in the statement that he did not sign

Deed of Transfer No.2199 dated 18.9.1997 supposed to have been attested by

AERC Moraes Notary Public and that the signature found in the said deed was not

his signature. Learned counsel for the 2nd Defendant-Appellant submitted that

Sathasivam Achalingam had not given evidence at the trial. However we note that

when the Plaintiff-Respondent made an application to the District Court to record

the evidence of Sathasivam Achalingam before the commencement of the trial on

the basis that Sathasivam Achalingam was an old person and a sick person, the 2nd

Defendant-Appellant strongly objected to the said application. The EQD has given

SC Appeal 205/2016

evidence in this case and stated that he compared the purported signatures of

Sathasivam Achalingam in both deeds with the signatures in the following

documents.

1. Passport of Sathasivam Achalingam.

2. Affidavit of Sathasivam Achalingam dated 20.1.2003.

3. Statement made by Sathasivam Achalingam to the Police.

4. Passbook issued by Commercial Bank to Sathasivam Achalingam under the

Account Number 8528826601.

The EQD in his evidence has stated that the purported signature of Sathasivam

Achalingam in Deed of Gift No.27 tally with the signature of Sathasivam

Achalingam found in the above documents but the purported signature of

Sathasivam Achalingam in Deed of Transfer No.2199 does not tally with the

signature of Sathasivam Achalingam found in the said documents. One of the

attesting witnesses in Deed of Gift No.27 dated 9.12.1997 gave evidence and

confirmed his signature in the deed. However the Defendant-Appellant did not call

any of the attesting witnesses in Deed of Transfer No.2199 dated 18.9.1997 except

the Notary Public who attested the said deed.

When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the learned District Judge was

correct when he, in his judgment dated 26.10.2009, decided that the Deed of Gift

No.27 dated 9.12.1997 is a genuine deed and that the Deed of Transfer No.2199

dated 18.9.1997 is null and void. I further hold that the learned Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court were correct when they in their judgment dated 17.12.2014

affirmed the judgment of the learned District Judge dated 26.10.2009. In view of

the conclusion reached above, I answer the above questions of law in the negative.

SC Appeal 205/2016

For the aforementioned reasons, I affirm the judgment of the learned District Judge

dated 26.10.2009 and the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated

17.12.2014 and dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
