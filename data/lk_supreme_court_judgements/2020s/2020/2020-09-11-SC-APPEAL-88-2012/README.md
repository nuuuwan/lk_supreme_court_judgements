JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare PC. J.,

The only question of law that this court is called upon to consider in this matter is,

as to whether the sentence imposed on the accused-appellant-appellant

(hereinafter the accused) is excessive. [The question of law raised in

subparagraph L of paragraph 8 of the Petition of the Petitioner].

The accused had been convicted for the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust in a

sum of Rs. 527,496.00, punishable under Section 391 of the Penal Code. Upon

conviction the accused has been imposed with a sentence of a term of 5 years

rigorous imprisonment and in addition a fine of Rs. 700,000.00 was also imposed,

which carried a default sentence of 21 months rigorous imprisonment.

Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the accused appealed to the Court of

Appeal. After the hearing of the appeal, their Lordships of the Court of Appeal by

their judgment of 9th July 2008 dismissed the appeal.

The appeal before us arises from the said judgment of the Court of Appeal. At the

outset the Learned Presidents counsel for the accused contended that he is only

seeking the relief prayed in paragraph c of the petition, namely, to vary the

custodial sentence imposed on the accused to a non-custodial sentence.

The allegation against the accused was that he committed Criminal Breach of Trust

in a sum of money, while being employed as an Accounts Executive at the

Freudenberg Air Service Ltd. It transpires from the record that the prosecution had

led 5 witnesses to prove the charge and after the conclusion of the prosecution

case, the accused had testified under oath on his own behalf and has refuted the

charge. In view of the fact that the court is only called upon to consider as to

4

whether the sentence is excessive or not, I see no purpose in considering the merits

of the prosecution case.

The main contention of the Learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the accused

was that 30 years has elapsed since the date of the offence, and it is highly

inappropriate to incarcerate a person who has had a clean life since then after the

lapse of such a long period. It was also submitted that the accused was incarcerated

for a period of 8 months consequent to the conviction and sentence by the High

Court before he was released on bail, pending the appeal by the Court of Appeal.

The attention of the court was also drawn to the deteriorating medical condition

of the accused. Medical records of the accused filed in this case (P1 to P10) is

indicative of that, the accused had suffered a myocardial infarction in 2006 and

had obtained treatment since then from the Cardiology Unit of the Sri

Jayawardenapura General Hospital and the Durdans Hospital.

The Learned Presidents Counsel relied on the decisions of Karunanayake v. The

State 1978 NLR 413, Ananda v. The Attorney General 1995 2 SLR 315,

Wimalaratne v. The State (CA Application 46/58-CA minutes dated 24.11.2000

and Ranawaka Arachchige Priyanka Ruwanari Perera (Sc Appeal 99/2006-SC

minutes of 21.07.2007).

In all these decisions the court broadly takes into account the time elapsed since

the date of the offence and the date the sentence was to be imposed as a factor in

deciding whether imposing a custodial sentence could be justified. Although the

period of time between those two events is a factor to be considered, taking into

consideration that law's delays are prevalent in the system of administration of

justice, the delay alone cannot be a factor to refrain from imposing a custodial

sentence. The delay, however, may be taken into account in conjunction with other

mitigatory factors in deciding the quantum of sentence that should be imposed to

commensurate with the gravity of the offence and any other aggravating factors.

Thus, in exercising judicial discretion, it is imperative for a judge to consider both

5

the mitigating factors as well as the aggravating factors before deciding on an

appropriate sentence.

The Learned Senior State Counsel submitted that he has no objection to waiving off

the custodial sentence imposed on the accused. However, the Learned Senior State

Counsel invited the court to consider enhancing the fine imposed by the High

Court in the event the court is of the view that the custodial sentence should be

replaced with a suspended term of imprisonment. This court considered the factors

peculiar to the case before us and is of the view that this is a fit instance to set aside

the custodial sentence and to impose a suspended term of imprisonment in lieu of

the same.

The court observes that this is a financial fraud committed by the accused when he

was placed in a position of trust in the capacity of the Accounts Executive by his

employer. As such this court is mindful of the fact that the sentence to be imposed

should act as a deterrent, from the perspective of the society.

Taking all facts and the attendant circumstances into consideration, the sentence

imposed by the Learned High Court Judge is hereby set aside and is substituted

with the following sentence;

The accused is imposed a sentence of two years (2 years) rigorous imprisonment

and, acting under Section 303 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the said term

of imprisonment is suspended for a period of ten years (10 years). In addition, a

fine of Rupees Two Million Five Hundred Thousand (Rs. 2.5 million) and a default

sentence of one year and nine months (1 year and 9 months) rigorous

imprisonment are also imposed on the accused.

The Learned High Court Judge is directed to pronounce and enforce the sentence

imposed by this court on or before 30th October 2020 and report back of its

implementation, to this court.

6

The accused is directed to appear before the High Court upon receipt of notice

from the High Court to that effect.

Appeal partially allowed.
