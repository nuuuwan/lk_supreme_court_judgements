SC Appeal 20/2017

2

Decided on: 3.7.2020 Sisira. J. de Abrew, J This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 8.8.2016.

The Petitioner-Petitioner-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner-Appellant) filed an application for bail in the High Court of Panadura

seeking to enlarge his son (the suspect) on bail. The suspect was remanded by the

learned Magistrate. The allegation levelled against the suspect was that he was in

possession of 42 grams of heroin. But according to the Government Analyst‟s

report pure quantity of heroin was 3.89 grams of heroin. I must state here that the

Government Analyst‟s report is not available in the brief. But their Lordships of

the Court of Appeal in their judgment dated 8.8.2016 have observed that the pure

quantity of heroin, according to the Government Analyst‟s report, was 3.89 grams.

The learned High Court Judge by his order dated 13.1.2016 refused the application

of the Petitioner-Appellant for bail. Being aggrieved by the said order of the

learned High Court Judge, the Petitioner-Appellant who is the father of the suspect

filed a revision application in the Court of Appeal seeking to revise and set aside

the said order of the learned High Court Judge. The Court of Appeal, by its

judgment dated 8.8.2016 dismissed the said revision application. Being aggrieved

by the said judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Petitioner-Appellant has appealed

to this court. This court by its order dated 27.1.2017, granted leave to appeal on

questions of law set out in paragraphs 10(a) and 10(b) of the Petition of Appeal

dated 15.9.2016 which are reproduced below.

1. Did the Court of Appeal err in law in deciding that the Petitioner has no

locus standi to maintain the Application for Revision?

SC Appeal 20/2017

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in law in not considering the fact since the

Petitioner is the Petitioner in the Application for bail in the High Court, the

Petitioner has locus standi to maintain the Revision Application in the Court

of Appeal against the order of the High Court.

The Petitioner-Appellant is the father of the suspect in this case. When the matter

was taken up for argument in the Court of Appeal, the learned Senior State

Counsel who appeared for the Attorney General raised an objection to the effect

that the Petitioner-Appellant had no locus standi to maintain the application for

revision. Their Lordships of the Court of Appeal have relied on the judgment of the

Court of Appeal (judgment of Justice Jayasuriya) in the case of Senathilaka Vs

Attorney General [1998] 3 SLR 290. The head note of the said judgment states as

follows. “The father of the accused has no locus standi to maintain the revision

application.”

In Senathilaka‟s case (supra) the accused who was convicted and sentenced did not

appeal against the conviction and the sentence. The father of the accused filed a

revision application against the conviction and the sentence. His Lordship Justice

Jayasuriya observed that it was a belated application. The accused in Senathilaka‟s

case (supra) who was granted bail did not face the trial and after an inquiry under

Section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the learned trial Judge proceeded

with the trial and convicted the accused. His Lordship Justice Jayasuriya at page

293 observed as follows.

“The present application is an application in revision. This is an

extraordinary jurisdiction which is exercised by the Court of Appeal and the

grant of relief is entirely dependent on the discretion of the court. Here the

accused's father is seeking discretionary relief from the Court of Appeal and

SC Appeal 20/2017

in considering the grant of discretionary relief, the court will closely

examine the conduct of the accused person. In the exercise of a discretion

the court scrupulously looks into the conduct of the ultimate party who is

deriving benefit from the orders to be made by the court in revision. Besides

this application has been preferred with undue and unreasonable delay. The

application is refused.”

Therefore, it is seen that in the above case, the Court of Appeal, after considering

the conduct of the accused and belatedness of the revision application, refused to

exercise the extraordinary jurisdiction and discretion of the Court of Appeal. His

Lordship Justice Jayasuriya in the above case has not expressed a general view that

the father of an accused in each and every case has no locus standi to maintain a

revision application.

In the present case, the suspect has not been convicted and it was an application to

revise the order of the leaned High Court Judge who refused to enlarge the suspect

on bail. Thus, it is seen that the facts of the present case are quite different from the

facts of Senathilaka‟s case (supra). After considering all the aforementioned

matters, I feel that it was wrong for the Court of Appeal to act on the judicial

decision in Senathilaka‟s case (supra) and dismiss the revision application.

The Court of Appeal has also based its judgment on Section 16 of the Judicature

Act which reads as follows.

(1) A person aggrieved by a judgment, order or sentence of the High

Court in criminal cases may appeal to the Court of Appeal with the

leave of such court first had and obtained in all cases in which the

Attorney-General has a right of appeal under this Chapter.

SC Appeal 20/2017

(2) In this section "a person aggrieved" shall mean any person whose

person or property has been the subject of the alleged offence in

respect of which the Attorney-General might have appealed under

this Chapter and shall, if such person be dead, include his next of kin

namely his surviving spouse, children, parents or further descendants

or brothers or sisters.

(3) Nothing in this section shall in any way affect the power of the

Court of Appeal to act by way of revision in an appropriate case.

It must be noted that Section 16(1) of the Judicature Act contemplates the right of

appeal given to an aggrieved person and Section 16(2) discusses about „a person

aggrieved‟. These two subsections do not discuss about the revisionary power of

the Court of Appeal. When Section 16(3) of the Judicature Act states that „nothing

in this section shall in any way affect the power of the Court of Appeal to act by

way of revision in an appropriate case‟, it has to be understood that revisionary

power of the Court of Appeal has not been taken away by the above two sub

sections [16(1) and 16(2)]. Section 16(3) of the Judicature Act in fact retains the

revisionary power of the Court of Appeal notwithstanding what is stated in sub

sections 16(1) and 16(2) of the Judicature Act. Thus, it was the duty of the Court of

Appeal to have considered the revision application of the Petitioner-Appellant. In

this connection I would like to consider a passage of the judgment of Sharvananda

CJ in the case of Sudharman de Silva Vs Attorney General [1986]1 SLR 9 at page

15 wherein His Lordship observed as follows.

“It is the court's duty to ensure that the statutory right of a person is not lost

to him except in strict accordance with the statute. The first duty of a judge

is to administer justice according to law, the law which is established for us

SC Appeal 20/2017

by an Act of Parliament. The judges in their anxiety to uphold the dignity of

courts should not fail to do justice according to enacted law. Dislike of the

effect of a statutory provision does not justify departing from its plain

language.”

In Rasheed Ali Vs Mohamed Ali [1981] 1SLR 262 this court held as follows.

“The powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are very wide and the

Court can in a fit case exercise that power whether or not an appeal lies.”

The revision application of the Petitioner-Appellant was dismissed on the ground

that the Petitioner-Appellant had no locus standi. It must be noted that revisionary

power of the Court of Appeal is exercised in order to correct the errors or mistakes

of judgments or orders of the courts of first instance. When an illegality or error of

a judgment/order of the court of first instance is brought to the notice of the Court

of Appeal, the Court of Appeal can, on its own motion, call for the record of the

court of first instance and give directions to correct such errors or set aside such

illegal judgments/orders. This view is supported by the judicial decision of this

court in the case of Attorney General Vs Gunawardena [1996] 2 SLR 149 wherein

five judges of this court held as follows.

“Revision like an appeal is directed towards the correction of errors but it is

supervisory in nature and its object is the due administration of justice and

not primarily or solely the relieving of grievances of a party.

The provision that the Court may upon Revision make such order, as it might

have made had the matter been brought up in due course of appeal may

have been enacted because of the recurring discussion in Courts, whether

powers of revision can or should be exercised where the matter might have

SC Appeal 20/2017

7

been brought up in appeal, had S.354 stood alone the argument that, by

reason of the Provision relating to the orders which a Court may make in

revision, the remedy by way of revision may be exercised only in a case

where an appeal lay may have been valid. S.354 being an enabling provision

it does not have the effect of impliedly excluding the exercise of the wide

powers of Revision given by other provisions in cases where no appeal lies.

In exercising the powers of Revision this Court is not trammelled by

technical rules of pleading and procedure. In doing so this Court has power

to act whether it is set in motion by a party or not and even ex mero motu”.

The expression „ex mero motu‟ according to „Wharton‟s Law Lexicon‟ 14th edition

page 393 means „of his own accord‟.

For the above reasons, I hold that in the present case, dismissing the revision

application of the Petitioner-Appellant on the basis that he had no locus standi is

wrong and the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 8.8.2016 should be set aside.

For the above reasons, I answer the above-mentioned 1st question of law in

affirmative. In view of the answer given to the 1st question of law, it is not

necessary to answer the 2nd question of law.

At the hearing of this appeal when court sought clarification whether the suspect in

this case has been released on bail, learned counsel for the Petitioner-Appellant

submitted that he had no knowledge on the matter.

SC Appeal 20/2017

For all the aforementioned reasons, I set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal

dated 8.8.2016 and direct the Court of Appeal to hear the revision application of

the Petitioner-Appellant on its merit.
