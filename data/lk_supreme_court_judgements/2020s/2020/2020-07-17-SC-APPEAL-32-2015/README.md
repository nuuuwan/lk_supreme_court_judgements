Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, CJ

The Accused-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter who is referred to as the accused) was indicted

along with his father in the High Court of Polonnaruwa. They were indicted for Murder and

Attempted Murder. The accused was convicted on both counts and his father was acquitted from

both counts after trial before a Judge. Death sentence was imposed on the accused for the count

of Murder and a term of fifteen years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of five thousand rupees

was imposed for the count of attempted murder. The accused appealed against the convictions

and sentences and the Court of Appeal dismissed the said Appeal.

Although, this Court had granted Special Leave on eight questions of law raised in the Petition of

Appeal, the learned President’s Counsel during the hearing before this Court submitted that the

only question of law that is pursued before this Court is the question, whether the judgment of

the Court of Appeal is contrary to law and against the weight of evidence adduced at the trial. In

this context the Learned President’s Counsel submitted that the judges of the Court of Appeal

misdirected themself and / or erred when they affirmed the conviction of the accused for murder.

Further narrowing down the issue, he contended that if the trial judge as well as the judges of the

Court of Appeal properly analysed the facts of this case, culpability of the 1st accused should

have been reduced to Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder on the basis of Grave and

Sudden Provocation. The contention on behalf of the accused is, that he had acted due to

“cumulative provocation”.

Exception 1 in Section 294 of the Penal Code reads as follows:

“Culpable Homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of self control by

grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation, or

causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident”.

Further, the Explanation under this exception reads as:

“Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting

to Murder is a question of fact”

SC/Appeal/32/2015

For an accused to succeed a plea of “provocation” there are several factors that has to be proved

on a balance of probability. First there has to be a ‘provocation’ that had taken place. However

each and every instance of provocation would not bring a situation within the parameters of this

exception. Such provocation needs to be ‘grave and sudden’. As the explanation to Exception 1

of section 294 of the Penal Code clarifies, whether a particular instance of provocation is grave

and sudden is a question of fact. The Court will have to determine this issue based on the facts of

each case. In addition to the existence of such provocation, the accused should have been

deprived of the power of self-control due to such provocation. One other important aspect is that

the accused should either cause the death of the person who caused that provocation or should

have caused the death of any other person due to a mistake or an accident.

The Privy Council in Attorney-General v John Perera (54 NLR 265) observed that

“The defence of provocation may arise where a person does intend to

kill or inflict grievous bodily harm but his intention to do so arises from

sudden passion involving loss of self control by reason of provocation”

(ibid at p 269).

The Privy Council in the same judgment further held that

“In order to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter the offender

must show first that he was deprived of self control and secondly that that

deprivation was caused by provocation which in the opinion of the jury was

both grave and sudden”. (ibid at p 269).

In Jamis v The Queen (53 NLR 401 at 404) the Court of Criminal Appeal held that

“A mitigatory plea under Exception 1 to section 294 is not available to

an accused person who can only satisfy the jury that, at the time when he

intentionally killed a person who had provoked him, he was acting under

the stress of that provocation. He must in addition establish that such

provocation, objectively assessed, was “grave and sudden enough to

SC/Appeal/32/2015

4

prevent the offence from amounting to murder”. That depends upon the

actual effect of the provocation upon the person provoked “and upon the

probability of its producing a similar effect upon other persons”.

It is also pertinent to observe that the Court of Criminal Appeal in K.D.J. Perera v The King

(53 NLR 193 at 202) held ,

“that the provocation must be such as to bring it within the category

termed sudden, that is to say, that there should be a close proximation in

time between the acts of provocation and of retaliation – which is a

question of fact. This element is of importance in reaching a decision as

to whether the time that elapsed between the giving of provocation and

the committing of the retaliatory act was such as to have afforded and

did in fact afford the assailant an opportunity of regaining his normal

composure, in other words, whether had been a “cooling” of his

temper”.

It is trite law that “the plea of grave and sudden provocation is required to be established by the

accused on a balance of probability” (“Offences Under the Penal Code of Ceylon” G.L.Peiris ,

2nd Ed, page 103).

Submissions of the Learned President’s Counsel for the accused and of the learned Deputy

Solicitor-General needs to be considered in the context of jurisprudence set out above, to decide

whether the appellant should have been given the benefit of the plea of provocation and

convicted for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to Murder.

The deceased in this case is a thirty-three years old lady. According to the evidence of the

Judicial Medical Officer, the death was caused due to brain damage following gun shot injuries.

There had been four entry wounds on the face and two of them were on either of the eyes. The

victim who received firearm injuries in the course of the same transaction was 20 years old at the

time of the incident. Altogether there had been seven entry wounds on his body and two of them

were on the chest area. They were identified as injuries that are sufficient in the ordinary course

of nature to cause death. When the nature of the injuries and the nature of the weapon used to

SC/Appeal/32/2015

5

commit such injuries are taken into account, there is a little difficulty to conclude that the person

who caused these injuries had entertained a “murderous intention” as described under section

294 of the Penal Code.

The prosecution has presented evidence of three eye-witnesses to the incident. They were the

injured victim (the brother-in-law of the deceased), the daughter of the deceased who was eleven

years of age at the time of the incident and a neighbour of the accused.

According to the injured victim, on the day in question, he had cycled passing the house of the

accused. At that stage the accused had questioned the victim regarding an issue over the

employees who were initially working for the accused and had later joined the victim. The victim

was assaulted and his cycle was pushed to a side by the accused. A scuffle had ensued between

the two. However, the brother and the father of the victim had later on rushed to the scene after

the victim ran away and the accused had handed over the victim’s push cycle to them.

The victim who ran towards his house had met his brother, the sister-in-law and their daughter

who were heading towards their paddy field. The Victim also had joined them. They’ve had to

walk passing the house of the accused to reach their paddy field. When they were nearing the

said house he had heard the father of the accused who stood trial as the 2nd accused verbally

abusing them and thereafter asking the accused to open fire at them. Then the victim had seen the

accused approaching them armed with a gun and opening fire at the deceased first. Thereafter a

second shot had been fired at the victim. He sustained injuries and fell on the road. Later on the

victim had seen the deceased lying with injuries and the daughter weeping near the deceased.

The victim was admitted to the hospital and had been treated as an in house patient. These

incidents had taken place around 7.30 in the morning.

The neighbour of the accused had corroborated the evidence of the victim on material points. She

had witnessed both incidents. The witness says that she witnessed the accused bringing a gun

from her house and later opening fire at the deceased and the victim. She confirmed that two

shots were fired. Thereafter the accused had run away leaving the gun behind.

SC/Appeal/32/2015

Police officers who visited the scene had taken charge of the gun and the witness had identified

the gun at the trial. This witness said that there was a gap between the initial scuffle between the

accused and the victim and the second incident of shooting.

The daughter of the deceased who witnessed the shooting also had testified at the trial and had

corroborated the evidence of the other two witnesses.

Both, the accused and his father, the 2nd accused made dock statements. The accused in his dock

statement admitted that there was an argument between him and the victim, initially. He said that

the incident of shooting took place, thereafter. According to the accused, after the first incident

he was attacked and he ran into a nearby house to hide. Then he saw the gun lying there. He

claimed that the gun went off when he pointed it.

The 2nd accused claimed that he was not at the scene.

The learned trial judge having analysed the evidence had accepted the evidence of the

prosecution. He had focused on the evidence of the neighbour of the accused and had concluded

that she is an independent witness. The learned trial judge rejected the versions of the two

accused. However, acquitted the 2nd accused on the basis that the evidence failed to prove a

common intention between the two accused. The accused in his allocutous said that he did not

intentionally shoot at the crowd. He claimed that he opened fire as he was assaulted.

The evidence transpired at the trial clearly proves the intention of the accused at the time of

shooting. Furthermore, the evidence proves that there were two separate incidents on the day in

question. There was a gap between the initial scuffle between the accused and the injured victim

and, the incident of shooting. Evidence does not show any abusive or provocative behaviour of

the victim or the deceased when they were approaching the place of the incident. The accused

did not take up the position that either the deceased or the victim provoked him and he lost his

self control due to such provocation. The version of the accused, namely, that a crowd of people

assaulted him, was rejected by the trial judge. Even if the initial incident – the scuffle between

SC/Appeal/32/2015

7

the victim and the accused - is taken as an act of provocation, there was a cooling off period

between the said incident and the act of shooting. The jurisprudence discussed hereinbefore does

not support the proposition that the accused is entitled to succeed in the plea of grave and sudden

provocation.

However, an examination of the jurisprudence relating to the defence of provocation reflects that

the scope of this defence had subsequently been expanded. The Court of Criminal Appeal in

Samithamby v The Queen (75 NLR 49) a verbal abuse by the wife several hours ago which

resulted in the subsequent stabbing that caused the death of the wife was considered in favour of

the plea of grave and sudden provocation. The majority of the court was of the opinion that the

accused was,

“brooding over his wife’s remark which was not only insulting, but also

expressed the thought that she preferred him to be dead. This mood

persisted and prevented him returning to work in the field”.

The court was of the view that the fact that :

“he had previously attempted to commit suicide supported the probability

that he ultimately stabbed his wife at a time when his mind was still

disturbed by his wife’s remark” (at p 50).

Further the Court held that :

“ There was no doubt an interval of time between the giving of

provocation and the time of stabbing, but the provocation given was

sudden, in the sense that the accused must have been taken aback when he

realised that his wife wished him to be dead. The evidence concerning the

subsequent period made it quite probable that in fact the accused all the

time suffered under a loss of self-control” ( at p 50).

The Court of Appeal in Gamini Silva v Attorney-General [1998] 3 SLR 248 following the

decision in Samythamby did set aside a conviction for murder and found the accused guilty of

SC/Appeal/32/2015

8

Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder on the basis of grave and sudden provocation. The

court was of the view that :

“although the accused appellant was not justified in killing the deceased,

that he was entitled to have succeeded in the defence of grave and sudden

provocation although an interval of time had lapsed between the time of

the provocation and the acts that led to the killing” (at p 252).

In Premlal v Attorney-General [2000] 2 SLR 403, the Court of Appeal cited with approval the

following passage from the judgment of Lahore High Court in Jan Muhammed v Emperor,

AIR 1929 – Lahore 861 at page 862 -

“Each case must depend upon its own facts and circumstances. In the present case, my

view is that, in judging the conduct of the accused, one must not confine himself to the

actual moment when the blow, which ultimately proved to be fatal, was struck, that is to

say, one must not take into consideration only the event which took place immediately

before the fatal blow was struck. We must take into consideration the previous conduct of

the woman. Her evil ways were the common scandal of the village and must have been

known to the husband, causing him extreme mental agony, shame and humiliation”.

The Court of Appeal in W.A. Gamini v Attorney-General, C.A. No. 142/2009, decided on 30

August 2016 set aside the conviction of Murder and convicted the appellant for the offence of

Culpable Homicide not amounting to Murder on the basis that the facts of the case establishes

the plea of continuing or cumulative provocation on a preponderance of evidence. The Court

observed that

“the chain of stressful events in the troubled relationship of the accused

and the deceased culminating in the aforesaid unfortunate incident, are

probable reasonably sufficient to entertain a plea of continuing or

cumulative provocation because the accused retaliated at the spur of the

SC/Appeal/32/2015

9

moment and that he could reasonably show that he was deprived of his

self control”.

Jurisprudence referred to above demonstrate that in considering the plea of grave and sudden

provocation an accused is entitled to rely upon a series of prior events that ultimately led to the

incident at which the death was caused. A court should not restrict its focus to an isolated

incident that resulted in the death, in considering a plea of grave and sudden provocation. The

aforementioned jurisprudence has widened the scope of this plea by expanding the limitations

recognised in its statutory form. Thereby, the concept of ‘Continuing’ or ‘Cumulative’

provocation has been recognised as a plea coming within the purview of the plea of grave and

sudden provocation recognised under Exception – 1, section 294 of the Penal Code. Therefore,

the proximity of time between the “actus reus” of the accused and the “provocative act” of the

victim should be considered in the context of the nature and circumstances in each case, in

deciding whether an accused is entitled to the benefit of the plea of Grave and Sudden

Provocation.

The Madras High Court in Marimuthu v State, Crl.A.(MD) No 29 of 2018, judgment dated

05.11.2019, cited with approval the following passages from the judgment of a Division Bench

of the same court in Poovammal v State, 2012 (2) MLJ (Crl.) 482, in explaining the concept of

‘Sustained Provocation’ recognised and developed by the courts in India.

“30. Under the English Criminal Law, the provocation must be grave and

also sudden. But, by way of judicial thinking, the Indian Criminal Law has

gone ahead. (K.M.NANAVATHI Vs. STATE OF MAHARASTRA

[A.I.R. 1962 S.C. 605]) In our system, there is the concept of "sustained

provocation". It is concerned with the duration of the provocation. There

may be incidents/occurrences, which are such that they may not make the

offender suddenly to make his outburst by his overt act. However, it may

be lingering in his mind for quite sometime, torment continuously and at

one point of time erupt, make him to lose his self control, make his mind

to go astray, the mind may not be under his control / command and results

SC/Appeal/32/2015

10

in the offender committing the offence. The sustained provocation /

frustration nurtured in the mind of the accused reached the end of breaking

point, under that accused causes the murder of the deceased.”

............

“34. In SUYAMBUKKANI v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU [1989 LW

(Crl.) 86], it is held as under:- "Though there has been here and there

attempts in those decisions to bring the sustained provocation under

Exception 1 to Section 300, I.P.C., there is a cardinal difference between

provocation as defined under Exception I and sustained provocation. The

only word which is common is 'provocation.' What Exception 1

contemplates is a grave and sudden provocation, whereas the ingredient of

sustained provocation is a series of acts more or less grave spread over a

certain period of time, the last of which acting as the last straw breaking

the camel's back may even be a very trifling one. We are, therefore, far

from grave and sudden provocation contemplated under Exception 1 to S.

300, I.P.C. Sustained provocation is undoubtedly an addition by Courts, as

anticipated by the architects of the Indian Penal Code."

Certain common features in the factual circumstances can be observed in the cases where the

similar concept was adopted by courts in Sri Lanka (Samythamby, Gamini Silva, Premalal and

W.A.Gamini).

In Samythamby, the accused husband caused the death of the wife. They were married for

nearly twenty-five years and were blessed with seven children. A few months prior to the fatal

attack, the wife was discovered in an act of intimacy with another person. Thereafter the wife

had been constantly scolding him and even ordered him out of the house. Further there had been

an attempt of suicide by the accused. On the day in question the wife had verbally abused him.

Few hours later the fatal attack by the accused took place. In Gamini Silva, the accused

husband caused the death of an eighty-two year old person who made improper advances

towards his wife. The accused husband was living at his in-laws with his young wife and their

infant child. The accused in the early hours of the day of the incident came to know about an

SC/Appeal/32/2015

11

instance where the deceased in the previous evening had made improper advances and

suggestions to his wife. Thereafter the fatal attack by the accused took place around 11.00 am

when the deceased came near his house. The accused in Premalal, was a University student. He

caused fatal injuries to a female colleague. There had been a love affair between the two and

later on the deceased had broken the relationship off and contracted a marriage with a person

from her village. However, the accused continued to be intimate with her and was pleading not to

leave him. Thereafter, the fatal attack took place at the University premises when the deceased

came to sit for the examination. In W.A.Gamini, the accused who was a soldier caused the death

of a corporal attached to the same camp. The latter had made undue advances towards a girl with

whom the accused had fallen in love with. The deceased had ignored accused’s plea not to

interfere with the relationship. Fatal attack had taken place at a time where the deceased ridiculed

the accused in front of the girl.

In all these instances, the fatal attack had taken place after a series of events that caused

disturbance to matrimonial and or intimate relationship that existed between the accused and

another person. In these cases the accused have gone through severe mental agony or distress up

to the point where the fatal attack takes place, due to such series of events. Courts therefore had

held that the accused should receive the benefit of the plea of grave and sudden provocation,

even though a time gap exists between the act of provocation and the fatal attack. During the

time between these two points there had not been a “cooling off” of the mind, but a state of

continued mental stress and trauma due to the nature and the gravity of the provocative conduct

of the deceased did exist. Therefore, for an accused to succeed in the plea of Grave and sudden

provocation on the basis of continuing or cumulative provocation, the court on a balance of

probability should be satisfied that the accused had gone through a state of continued mental

stress and agony during the time gap between the provocative conduct and the fatal attack.

The Indian Supreme Court in Nanavati v State of Maharashtra, AIR 1962 SC 605 at page 629

having analysed decisions of the High Court in which the accused succeeded in the plea of grave

and sudden provocation observed that,

“All the said four decisions dealt with a case of a husband killing his wife

when his peace of mind had already been disturbed by an earlier discovery

SC/Appeal/32/2015

12

of the wife’s infidelity and the subsequent act of her operated as a grave

and sudden provocation on his disturbed mind” (emphasis added).

In determining on the issue of provocation, the court should be mindful of the parameters to

which the defence of grave and sudden provocation should be expanded in the context of

continued or cumulative provocation. In this regard it is pertinent to note the following dicta of

the High Court of Delhi, in Suresh Kumar v State of Delhi CRL. A 182/2002, judgment dated

19 February 2018.

“(e) Sustained provocation' will be recognised only if the last straw' or the

immediate act that led to the killing is in the spur of the moment and has a

nexus to the past acts of sustained provocation. The Court will have to be

cautious in adding further exceptions of that kind to Exception 1 to

Section 300 IPC.”

An examination of the facts of the case under consideration clearly indicates, that the series of

events revealed therein cannot be brought within the parameters of the defence of cumulative or

continued or sustained provocation discussed hereinbefore. There had been no provocative

conduct or any other type of an interaction between the accused and the deceased lady, when

they were attacked by the accused. The only connecting factor is that she happened to be the

sister-in-law of the injured victim with whom the accused had an altercation in the same

morning. The altercation itself, the facts surrounding the altercation and the circumstances

leading to the said altercation, in my view are not of such a nature and gravity resulting the

accused to have gone through continued stress or agony resulting in the subsequent act of

shooting. Therefore in my view the accused is not entitled to the benefit of the Exception – 1 to

Section 294 of the Penal Code.

The fact that the accused opened fire twice, the range of fire and the location and nature of

injuries on the deceased and the victim clearly demonstrate the intention to kill entertained by the

accused.

SC/Appeal/32/2015

13

In view of all the findings discussed hereinbefore, there is no basis to interfere with the decision

of the learned trial judge to convict the accused for the offences of Murder and Attempted

Murder.

Accordingly, the question “whether the judgment of the Court of Appeal is contrary to law and

against the weight of evidence adduced at the trial ?” is answered in the negative and the learned

trial judge’s decision to convict the accused-appellant for murder and attempted murder and the

sentences imposed on both counts are affirmed.

The appeal of the accused-appellant is dismissed.
