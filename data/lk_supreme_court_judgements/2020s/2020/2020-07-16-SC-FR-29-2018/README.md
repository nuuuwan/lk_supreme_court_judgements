Aluwihare PC. J.,

The subject matter of this Application concerns whether the non-implementation, by the

1st to 3rd Respondents, of the Scheme of Recruitment (SOR) issued in 2016 for the purpose

of effecting new recruitments for the post of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ in the Sri Lanka

Railways Department, amounts to a violation of the Petitioners’ right to equality before

the law and equal protection of the law, guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Factual Background

The Petitioners are office bearers and members of the Trade Union, ‘Locomotive Assistants

Union’ (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Petitioner Union), and are employed

in the Sri Lanka Railways Department as ‘Railway Driver Assistants’. The Added-

Respondents are also employees of the said Department, as well as office bearers and

members of the Trade Union, ‘Railway Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union’

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 6th Added-Respondent Union). The Added-

Respondents have intervened in this Petition representing the interests of the ‘Railway

Engine Drivers’ of the Department of Railways.

This Application challenges the alleged non-implementation by the 1st to 3rd Respondents

of the Scheme of Recruitment (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the SOR of 2016)

issued in 2016 marked ‘P9’, and claims that their failure to make necessary new

recruitments to the post of ‘Railway Engine Driver Assistants’ in terms of the SOR, is a

violation of the Petitioners’ right to equality before the law and equal protection of the

law as enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Petitioners pray for a

6

Declaration to that effect, and a direction to the Respondents to take appropriate steps to

immediately fill the existing vacancies in the post of ‘Railway Driver Assistant’, as per the

SOR of 2016.

In the sequence of events leading up to the status quo, it is the Petitioners’ contention (as

per the amended Petition dated 05th March 2018) that in 1993, four existing ‘Labour

grades’ in the Department of Railways [Third Enginemen, Second Enginemen, Shed

Enginemen, and Shunting Engine Driver] were amalgamated to form the two grades

designated as ‘Railway Engine Drivers (shunting)’ and ‘Driver Assistants’. In 1996, these

two grades have been taken out of the ‘Labour grades’ and placed under the ‘Major Staff

grade’ (as evidenced by the letter marked ‘P1’ and the General Manager’s Circular

marked ‘P21’). With the subsequent establishment of the Sri Lanka Technological Service,

these two grades have been assigned the salary scales pertaining to Sri Lanka

Technological Services Grades II A and II B, respectively.

Thereafter, effecting a general re-structuring of salaries in the public service, the Public

Administration Circular No: 06/2006 (marked ‘P2’), brought about a re-categorisation

and re-classification of public sector employees with effect from 1st January 2006. Under

the said Circular, the ‘Engine Drivers (Shunting)’ and ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ were

once again categorized under ‘Labour grades’, and in the new classification, they were

assigned the salary code PL 2-2006 A (Primary Level- Semi Skilled). This decision appears

to have been taken as there was no category, after the restructuring of salaries in the

public service by the said Public Administration Circular, to accommodate the ‘Major

Staff grade’- the grade in which the ‘Engine Drivers (Shunting)’ and the ‘Railway Driver

Assistants’ were hitherto placed.

Following the protests against the above course of action by the 1st Petitioner Union and

the 6th Added-Respondent Union, the Circular No: 06/2006 was amended in 2007 by,

inter alia, the Public Administration Circular No: 06/2006 (IV) (marked ‘P3’). This

amendment had been consequent to a recommendation made by a Committee appointed

by the then Secretary to the Ministry of Transport to resolve the issue.

The Cabinet of Ministers had approved a Scheme of Recruitment (SOR) on 03rd February

2010 in terms of the above Circular (‘P3’) for the new Grade of ‘Railway Driver Assistants

7

and Engine Drivers (Shunting)’ to take effect from 01st January 2010. By virtue of this

SOR both the ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ and the ‘Engine Drivers (Shunting)’ were placed

in the category of ‘Management Assistant Technical-Segment 3’ and were assigned the

salary scale code MT 1-2006(A) (Rs. 14,425-10x145-11x170-6x240-14x320-

23,665). The ‘Engine Driver (Shunting)’ was placed higher in the same salary scale (as

per ‘P5’).

This SOR submitted by the Petitioners marked as ‘P5’, stipulates the approved cadre for

‘Engine Drivers (Shunting)’ as 103 and the approved cadre for ‘Railway Driver Assistants’

as 390, out of which 50% is to be recruited through an open competitive examination,

with 10% through a limited examination for internal applicants and 40% through merit.

It also lays down the academic and technical qualifications for new recruitments to grade

III of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ and for the post of ‘Engine Driver (Shunting)’.

Meanwhile, the Department of Management Services (DMS), expressing a contrary view

by their letter dated 09th April 2013 (marked ‘IP4-A’) had stipulated that the approved

cadre of the Sri Lanka Railways is as set out in Annex1 thereto, in terms of which the new

recruitments to the post of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ should be made under the salary

scale PL 3- 2006(A) as opposed to MT 1-2006(A). It conveyed that those Assistants who

were already drawing a salary as per the salary scale of MT 1-2006(A) should continue

to receive that salary.

The Petitioners submit that around August 2013, the 1st Petitioner Trade Union became

aware of an attempt by the General Manager- Railways (1st Respondent) to place the

‘Railway Driver Assistants’ in a lower salary scale (under salary code PL 3 -2006 A)

applicable to the Grade of Primary Level-Skilled Workers which is a ‘Labour grade’, while

the ‘Engine Driver (Shunting)’ were to remain in the previous higher salary scale

stipulated by the SOR of 2010 (namely, salary code MT 1-2006 (A) for Management

Assistant Technical- Segment 3). Challenging, inter alia, this attempt to thwart the

operation of the approved SOR and place them in a lower salary scale, the Petitioner

Union of Railway Driver Assistants had filed the Fundamental Rights Application SC FR

No. 341/13 on 01st October 2013 (Petition marked ‘P6’) claiming the infringement of

their right to equality before the law and equal protection of the law as per Article 12(1).

8

It is stated by the Petitioners that while the above case (SC FR No. 341/13) was pending,

a new Scheme of Recruitment in respect of recruitment of Railway Driver Assistants was

approved by the Public Service Commission on 9th June 2016 and 29th September 2016

(marked ‘P9’). This new SOR preserved the status quo by placing the ‘Railway Driver

Assistants’ under the same category of ‘Management Assistant Technical- Segment 3’ and

assigning them the salary code MT 1-2006 (A) (Rs. 14,425-10x145-11x170-6x240-

14x320- 23,665).

As for the changes brought about by the new SOR of 2016, it increased the cadre of

‘Railway Driver Assistants’ from 390 to 540; 30% of them was to be recruited through

an open competitive examination while the rest 70% was to be selected through a limited

examination for internal applicants. The earlier method of recruitment based on merit

was done away with. Another substantial change brought about was that it amended the

recruitment qualifications for external recruits to the post of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’

stipulated in the earlier SOR. It removed the academic qualification requirement of

securing four passes at the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination in the Science Stream,

and replaced the previous technical qualification of completing a NVQ Level-5 course of

not less than 18-month duration (related to diesel engine operation), with the

requirement to complete a 2 ½ year technical course recognized by the Tertiary and

Vocational Education Commission.

The Petitioners state that they accepted the new SOR of 2016 as a settlement of their

grievances. With the Railway Department subsequently commencing calling for external

and internal applications for vacancies in the post of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ under

the new SOR, and publishing a notice in the Government Gazette to that effect dated 23rd

December 2016, the Petitioners had moved the Court on 13th February 2017 to terminate

the proceedings of the above case filed by them- SC FR No. 341/13.

Meanwhile, the 6th Added-Respondent Union had forwarded proposals to be

incorporated in to this new SOR of 2016 to the then Secretary to the Ministry of

Transport, the relevant Minister, the Department of Management services and the

Ministry of Public Administration and Management (‘8R6’) on several occasions. In

opposition to the Examination for recruitment under the SOR 0f 2016 being gazetted,

9

they had resorted to Trade Union action on 08th April 2016, and had threatened such

action again on 06th October 2016 and 18th January 2018 (‘8R8’).

In view of the fact that the new SOR of 2016 did not include any of their suggested

amendments, the Railway Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union had filed a separate

Fundamental Rights Application - SC FR No. 76/2017 on 16th February 2017 (evidenced

by ‘P8’) challenging the legitimacy of the SOR, and seeking to amend the new SOR of

2016- purportedly to bring it into conformity with the aforementioned Public

Administration Circular No: 06/2006 and the Safety Rules of the Department of

Railways- which appear to be Rules governing the operation of trains, coming into effect

in the year 1983 and are currently applicable.

The Engine Drivers’ Union had also sought to intervene in the earlier Fundamental Rights

Application filed by the Petitioners (SC FR No. 341/13) on 22nd February 2017 (after

almost 4 years had passed since the Petitioners had filed the case and after the Petitioners

moved to terminate it, as evidenced by ‘P7’) but the intervention Application was not

supported by them.

However, when the Petitioners who had moved to terminate the proceedings of SC FR No.

341/13 were informed that the recruitment process of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ which

was then underway, had been suspended on the directive of the Senior Assistant Secretary

to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation by a letter dated 17th January 2017, they

opted not to support the motion for termination. But with the Additional General

Manager of the Railway Department subsequently informing the Petitioners that the

suspension had been cancelled on 10th March 2017, the Petitioners were satisfied, and

filed a motion to support the application for termination of proceedings. Consequently,

the proceedings of SC FR No. 341/13 were terminated on 30th March 2017.

Soon after, however, another complication had developed to stifle the recruitment

process. The Petitioners had received a letter from the 1st Respondent [GM-Railways]

dated 23rd May 2017 (marked ‘P12’), communicating that on the instructions of the

Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation (2nd Respondent) pursuant to a meeting held by

the then Secretary to the Ministry, the recruitments to the post of ‘Railway Driver

Assistant’ have been temporarily suspended for two weeks. The reason had been given as

10

the need to allow time for ‘Railway Engine Drivers’ to seek legal relief under the case filed

by them, but have stated that this decision does not suspend the written examination. The

Petitioners state that the ‘Railway Engine Drivers’, however, did not take any further steps

in the abovementioned Fundamental Rights Application -SC FR No. 76/2017 filed by

them (which suffered the fate of being postponed several times until finally being

withdrawn a few months later on 25th October 2017), nor did they seek any other legal

remedy during the two weeks’ grace period.

After the two-week period had lapsed with no objections, the Open Competitive

Examination for Recruitment to the Post of Railway Engine Driver Assistant- Grade III

was fixed for 26th August 2017. But after the strike action on 21st June 2017 by the 6th

Added-Respondent Union opposing, inter alia, the recruitment of Driver Assistants as per

the SOR of 2016 (‘P16’) the examination was yet again postponed on the instructions of

the then Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (as per his letter dated

02nd August 2017 -marked ‘P14(a)’).

Two months later, the letter postponing the exam was cancelled by the 3rd Respondent

(Secretary to the Ministry of Transport) by his letter dated 28th September 2017 (marked

‘P14(b)’) by which he directed the 1st Respondent (GM-Railways) to take all necessary

steps to hold the said examination without delay. Consequently, the 1st Respondent had

abided by the instructions and written to the Commissioner General of Examinations to

take all necessary steps to conduct the examination. The examination was finally fixed

for 23rd December 2017.

At this juncture, the 6th Added-Respondent Union of Engine Drivers, being aggrieved by

the fact that the proposals presented by them to be incorporated in the new SOR of 2016

to purportedly bring it into conformity with Safety Rules and PA Circular No: 06/2006

were rejected, resorted to Trade Union action on 12th October 2017 (paragraph 22 XVIII

of the affidavit of the 8th Added-Respondent). As a consequence of such Trade Union

action, an Eight Member Committee was appointed by the Secretary to the President on

12th October 2017 to look into the concerns raised by the ‘Railway Engine Drivers’

regarding the SOR of 2016 and to make recommendations to resolve the outstanding

issues (‘IP13A’). Subsequent to meeting with the said Committee, the 6th Added-

11

Respondent Union withdrew the FR Application No. 76/2017 filed by them on 25th

October 2017 (‘P13’), as they were given an undertaking by the then Secretary to the

Ministry of Transport to suspend the examination until the SOR of 2016 was amended.

Thereafter, the 6th Added-Respondent Union had yet again struck work along with the

‘Trade Union Alliance of the Department of Railways’ on 06th December 2017

(paragraph 11 of the Petitioners’ written submissions) over salary anomalies, even with

the G.C.E. Ordinary Levels Examination looming close. At that point, the President had

appointed a Cabinet Sub-Committee chaired by the 4th Respondent to resolve the issues

of the strikers. While the negotiations continued, the examination was yet again

postponed indefinitely on the instructions of the 4th Respondent on 20th December 2017

(‘P15’) for the time being. This was, in the sequence of events, effectively the fourth time

that the recruitment process of ‘Railway Engine Driver Assistants’ had been halted.

The abovementioned Cabinet Sub-Committee on 16th February 2018 issued a Joint

Cabinet Memorandum with their observations on outstanding issues (‘IP16-A’). By issue

number 02 of the Memorandum, the Committee has identified that, increasing the basic

qualifications for Primary Technical Service MN1 level salaried officers to recruit them

to MT1 and MT2 level salary scales had created an anomaly, in that MN1 level officers

were imposed with a basic qualification of NVQ level proficiency, resulting in no

qualified candidates being available for their vacancies, as it exceeded the level of

education required by these employees in discharging their duties. However, the

Petitioners submit in their written submissions (paragraph 21) that issue number 02 does

not concern Driver Assistants who were previously in PL 2 salary scale but only refers to

Primary Technical Service (MN 1 level) officers who were subsequently given MT 1 and

MT 2 level salary scales. They further state that a number of qualified candidates applied

for the competitive examination when it was gazetted to be held in 23rd December 2017.

Observation number 3 in the Memorandum, notes the need to “revise salary scales and

recruitment schemes of all officers” of the Railway Department. The Cabinet of Ministers

made a policy decision dated 9th May 2018 (‘IP16-B’) and granted approval to implement

the observations, including observation 3 (as a long-term measure) to resolve the issue,

thus allowing for the formulation of a new SOR. The approval however, was “subject to

12

the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation taking action to convert the Department of

Sri Lanka Railways to a closed Department in future.”

The Petitioners on the other hand contend that continuous disruptions to the process of

recruitment are a result of the Respondent Authorities acquiescing to the strike actions

or threats of striking work by the 6th Added-Respondent Trade Union of the Engine

Drivers, merely for the purpose of gaining leverage to achieve their demands contained

in the letter marked “P16”, which includes inter alia, the Union’s objections to the SOR

of 2016 and the implementation of it.

The Petitioners state that even though the above SOR increased the cadre of ‘Railway

Driver Assistants’ to 540, at the moment only 220 ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ are in

service, creating more than 300 vacancies, with the last intake being in 2011, nearly 09

years ago. They claim that the Railway Department functions were hindered by Railway

Driver Assistants being severely understaffed. Due to this, they state, around 140 workers

from lower labour grades had had to function as ‘Acting Driver Assistants’, covering the

duties since 2010. The 6th Added-Respondent Union has concurred that due to the

shortage of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’, they are currently engaging in work with labour

grade workers, to cover the duties of ‘Driver Assistants’, in their letter to the 2nd

Respondent on 04th April 2016 (‘IP6’).

These difficulties are also evidenced by the letter of the Chief Engineer (Motive Power)

addressed to the 1st Respondent dated 22nd May 2017 (marked ‘P18’), where he

communicates the hardships in maintaining services with 300 existing vacancies for

Railway Driver Assistants, and requests him to expedite the recruitments.

With such an impasse continuing without a resolution in sight, the 1st Respondent had

written to the Coordinating Secretary to the President on 04th December 2017 (‘P19’),

reiterating that currently bare minimum service is maintained by employing Technical

Assistants to cover the duties of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ and re-employing retired

Engine Driver Assistants on contract basis. He has thus requested the Secretary to issue

instructions to the officials of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to expedite

recruitments, in view of these facts.

13

Additionally, the Petitioners also state that due to no new recruitments being done, they

have been denied their usual nine-hour rest after an outstation turn, and their legitimate

expectation of promotion to the post of ‘Engine Driver (Shunting)’ of which 30% of the

vacancies are open to the ‘Driver Assistants’ who have completed 5 years of satisfactory

service. They submit that this has resulted in both the posts of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’

and ‘Engine Drivers (Shunting)’ being understaffed.

In light of these circumstances, the Petitioners submit that the failure or the refusal of the

1st to 3rd Respondents to act in accordance with SOR of 2016 and to make the

recruitments to the post of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’, is an arbitrary and an

unreasonable act. They claim that it is a violation of the Fundamental Right to equality

before the law and equal protection of the law, of the 1st Petitioner Union and of the other

Railway Assistants represented by them, as guaranteed to them by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

Competing Interests of the Petitioners and the 6th to 8th Added-Respondents

The main issue in this Application is whether the non-implementation of the Scheme of

Recruitment of 2016 which is currently in force regulating the recruitments to the post

of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ by the 1st to 3rd Respondents, is indeed a violation of the

Petitioners’ right to equality before the law and their entitlement to the equal protection

of the law.

However, when cumulatively considering the above illustration of the sequence of events

that had come to pass, with the affidavit of the 8th Added-Respondent and its annexures,

as well as the affidavit of the 3rd Respondent, it is apparent that the practical

implementation of the SOR had been continuously disrupted due to the 6th Added-

Respondent Union resorting to Trade Union action whenever the Railways Department

was poised to conduct the Open Competitive Examination for admitting new recruits for

the post of ‘Railway Driver Assistant’, as per the SOR of 2016.

The persistent objections of the 6th Added-Respondent Trade Union, against the

implementation of the SOR of 2016 are based on the following grounds;

14

1. The requirement of a 2 ½ years’ vocational training course as an entry qualification

is unnecessary for Driver Assistants, considering the primary level duties carried out

by them;

2. The Driver Assistants who perform ‘primary duties’ according to Rule 169(c) of the

Appendix to Rules and Regulations – Part I (Operating), being classified under the

‘Management Assistant’ Grade and being placed on Salary Scale MT1-2006(A) is

contrary to PA Circular 6/2006;

3. Authorizing the Executive to assign technical and operating tasks to Railway Driver

Assistants, by virtue of the General Definition of Assigned Tasks (clause 3.3) and their

duties (clause 6) of the SOR-2016, undermines the hitherto exclusive supervision of

the Driver Assistants exercised by the Engine Drivers, and is contrary to Rule 157(c)

of the Railway Safety Rules, 1983.

These objections hold little legal merit and require mere cursory attention as it is not the

subject matter of this application.

It must be noted, that by any stretch of the imagination, over-qualification cannot present

an issue for the safety of railway operations. A training of a longer duration can only lead

to recruits being better qualified and adept at performing the technical and safety

procedures listed in clause 6 of the SOR and the Safety Rules 155, 157, 161-163 and

178, which is only in agreement with the vehement concern expressed by the 6th to 8th

Added-Respondents on public safety. The concern over Driver Assistants who perform

‘primary duties’ being placed in the same salary scale as the Engine Drivers [MT 1-

2006(A)] being prejudicial to them too is unsubstantiated as it can be observed that the

Engine Drivers were placed higher in the same salary scale since the approval of the SOR

of 2010 (as per ‘P5’), commensurate with their duties. A perusal of ‘P21’- the General

Manager’s Circular No. 4 for the month of April in 1996- indicates that both these grades

come from an amalgamation of four existing grades at the time, and were taken out of

the ‘labour schedule’ together as far back as 1996. The said Circular also notes that future

action should be taken in accordance with this change, when effecting appointments,

promotions etc. Further, a study of Clause 3 and 6 of the SOR does not indicate that the

Driver Assistants being assigned duties by the executive, necessarily deprives the Engine

15

Drivers of their habitual supervision and control over the Railway Driver Assistants for

the operation of the railway services.

Furthermore, as stated before, the 6th Added-Respondent Union had forwarded proposals

on several occasions to address the concerns itemized in numbers 1, 2 and 3 above, with

a view to incorporating them in to the SOR of 2016, to a host of Authorities-the then

Secretary to the Ministry of Transport, the Minister of Transport, the Department of

Management services and also the Ministry of Public Administration and Management

(as evidenced by ‘8R6’). It is therefore clear that the stakeholders involved in the making

of the new SOR of 2016 were well aware of these suggestions, and have opted not to

incorporate them into the said SOR, which is justifiable.

In this context, it must be noted, as the 8th Added-Respondent contended [in his affidavit],

Section 37 of the Railways Ordinance, No. 1 of 1903 places the safety of the public as the

overriding concern:

“In the construction to be placed upon this Ordinance, every railway official

shall be deemed to be legally bound to do everything necessary for, or conducive

to, the safety of the public which he shall be required to do by this Ordinance, or

by any rule which shall be made by the Minister, and of which rule such official

shall have had notice; and every such official shall be deemed to be legally

prohibited from doing every act which shall be likely to cause danger.”

(emphasis added)

The 1st Respondent [GM Railways] writing to the Coordinating Secretary of the President

on 04th December 2017 (‘P19’) has referred to the hardships faced by the Railway

Department owing to the recruitments being halted and has reiterated that currently

even the bare minimum service is maintained by employing Technical Assistants who are

of the untrained labour grade to cover the duties of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’, and also

re-employing retired Engine Driver Assistants on contract basis. The 6th Added-

Respondent Union in ‘8R-6’ concurs with this fact.

It is therefore illogical, how the Added-Respondents who are railway employees legally

bound to give utmost importance to the safety of the commuters and who express

16

vehement concern over public safety, are agreeable to compromising on safety as well as

efficiency by working with untrained labour grade employees and senescent retired

employees as replacements for technically-trained Driver Assistants. This is also evident

from their protests against the Driver Assistants acquiring any awareness of Safety Rules

(as per page 191 of the 6th Added-Respondent’s letter marked ‘8R-15’). They are also

objecting to the Driver Assistants being authorised to apply the brakes to stop the train,

should the driver become incapacitated during the journey (which is in line with Rule

158 of the Sri Lanka Railway -Safety Rules 1983 and Clause 6 of the SOR of 2016), and

they also oppose the Driver Assistants being given the training required for them to pass

the competitive test for that purpose (as per page 203 of the meeting minutes marked

‘8R-15’).

It is evident, therefore, that the opposition to the SOR of 2016 harboured by the 6th

Added-Respondent Union of Engine Drivers aim more towards maliciously stripping the

Driver Assistants of their powers and demoting them to the labour grade by holding the

public at ransom through trade union action, all the while paying lip service to ensuring

the safety of the public, which indeed they are legally obligated to ensure.

Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the object of the present Application is not

inquiring into the validity of the SOR of 2016 from the stand point of the rights of the 6th

Added-Respondent Union, but is delving into the legality or otherwise of its non-

implementation in the context of the Petitioner’s Fundamental Rights. Whether the SOR

itself was violative of the 6th to 8th Added-Respondents’ Fundamental Rights was the

subject matter of a separate Fundamental Rights Application- SC FR No. 76/2017 filed

by the 6th to 8th Added-Respondents; but it had been withdrawn by them before the matter

could proceed to argument. The present application, therefore, cannot act as a vehicle

for the 6th Added-Respondent Union to challenge the SOR, which came into force over

03 years ago. Hence, the SOR of 2016 stands unchallenged, until such time it is replaced

by a new SOR.

As the learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the1st to 5th Respondents submitted,

the determination of the present application hinges on the presence or absence of a legal

17

impediment for the 1st to 3rd Respondents to implement the SOR of 2016 and whether

the protection of the law will be achieved through its implementation.

For this purpose, attention should be paid to two main considerations. Firstly, whether

there are any legal impediments which hinder the 1st to 3rd Respondents from

implementing the SOR of 2016, Secondly, if no such impediments are present, whether

by such non-implementation of the SOR, they [the 1st to 3rd Respondents] have denied the

Petitioners’ right to equality before the law and equal protection of the law, enshrined in

Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Legal Impediments to the Implementation of the SOR

As per Article 55(1) of the Constitution, the Cabinet shall provide for and determine all

matters of policy relating to public officers, relating to schemes of recruitment, codes of

conduct for public officers, and the principles to be followed in making promotions and

transfers etc. However, Article 55(3) vests the authority in the Public Service Commission

(PSC) to effect appointments, promotions, transfers and disciplinary control/dismissal of

public officers. It states as follows:

Article 55(3) – “Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the appointment,

promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers shall be

vested in the Public Service Commission.”

The Public Service Commission Procedural Rules- Volume I on ‘Appointment, Promotion

and Transfer of Public Officers’ (published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1589/30 dated

20.02.2009) issued in terms of Article 61B and 58(1) of the Constitution which came

into effect from 02nd April 2009, in its Chapter IV- titled ‘Service Minutes & Schemes of

Recruitment’ stipulates the following:

38. The Commission shall have the discretion to approve or approve with

revisions or reject or revoke a Scheme of Recruitment or Service Minute or the

proposed amendments submitted by a Secretary… (Emphasis added)

18

The Public Service Commission, ‘Guideline for Preparing Schemes of Recruitment’ for

streamlining SORs as per P.A Circular No. 06/2006- Section 4 titled ‘Submission for

Approval’ provides as follows:

I. The Head of Department shall invariably be responsible for the content and the

accuracy of a draft scheme of recruitment when it is submitted to the Public

Service Commission for approval.

II. Since the schemes of recruitment are prepared for a category of service, it is

necessary to obtain from the Director General of Management Services, a formal

approval pertaining to all posts belonging to such category of service.

III. It is necessary to obtain the relevant recommendations of the Director General

of Establishments and the National Salaries and Cadres Commission for the draft

scheme of recruitment concerned.

IV. Thereafter the Head of Department should forward the prepared draft

scheme of recruitment embodying the aforesaid recommendations together with

the recommendations of the respective Secretary of the line Ministry to the Public

Service Commission for approval. (emphasis added)

In view of the above provisions, the Head of the Department- the General Manger-

Railways (1st Respondent) bears responsibility for the contents of the draft SOR which is

to be forwarded to the PSC after due formal approval by Director General of Management

Services together with the recommendations of the National Salaries and Cadres

Commission, Director General of Establishments and the Secretary of the line Ministry.

The final approval is given by the PSC.

It must be noted that the Scheme of Recruitment in ‘P9’ bears the signature of the General

Manger of Railways-the Department Head, dated 16.11.2016, the signature of the

Secretary to the line Ministry, dated 05.12.2016 as well as the signature of the Secretary

of the Public Service Commission, dated 17.01.2017 along with a minute stating the

following:

19

“Y%S ලංකා දුම්රිය දෙපාර්තදම්රන්තුදෙහි දුම්රිය එන්තින්ත ියැදුරු සහායක තනුර

සඳහා ෙන දෙෙ සංද ෝධිත බඳො ගැනීදම්ර පටිපාටිය 2016.09.29 ෙන දින රාcH

දේො දකාමිෂන්ත සභාෙ විසින්ත අනුෙත කරන ලදී.”

Hence, the fact that the SOR of 2016 is founded in law is clear. After coming into force,

despite the proposals made by the 6th Added-Respondent Union for its amendment, no

amended SOR had been submitted to the PSC for approval. The Fundamental Rights

Application SC FR No. 76/2017 filed by the 6th to 8th Added-Respondents challenging the

SOR and seeking to amend it was also withdrawn by them on 25th October 2017. The

implementation of the SOR of 2016 was last halted for the time being by the 1st

Respondent on the instructions of the 4th Respondent on 20th December 2017 (‘P15’) as

the Cabinet sub-Committee discussion was then ongoing. The policy decision made by

the Cabinet Sub-Committee on 9th May 2018 (‘IP16-B’) in terms of the observations in

their Joint Cabinet Memorandum to prepare a new SOR has not yet materialized.

As such, with no amendment or replacement of the SOR of 2016, it continues in force.

This is substantiated by Section 2:1:1 of Chapter II of the Establishments Code:

“The Scheme of Recruitment in respect of a post in the Public Service which has

already received approval, will continue to be in force subject to any changes as

may be made hereafter.”

As no subsequent changes in the form of an amendment, as envisaged in the

Establishments Code, had been brought to the SOR of 2016, the above provision clarifies

that the SOR marked ‘P9’ continues to be the SOR applicable in respect of the post of

Railway Driver Assistant, until such time an amendment or a replacement is made. As

per Abeywickrama v. Pathirana and Others (1986) 1 SLR 120, it is trite law that the

Establishments Code by virtue of its constitutional origin acquires statutory force,

provided that it’s not inconsistent with any provision of the Constitution. Therefore, it is

apparent that the SOR of 2016 remains in force unchallenged since its approval on 29th

September 2016.

As held by Sharvananda C.J. in C.W. Mackie and Co. Ltd v. Hugh Molagoda,

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and Others (1986)1 SLR 300 at page 310,

20

noting that in respect of a violation of Article 12(1), “To succeed in the plea the petitioner

has to establish discrimination in the performance of a lawful act. The doctrine of

equality is intended to advance justice according to law, by avoiding hostile

discrimination” (emphasis added). Hence, the SOR of 2016 which springs from a legal

source and is currently in force, ought to encounter no legal impediment for its

implementation. It must now be inquired into whether such non-implementation of a

legally valid SOR is violative of the Petitioners’ rights under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

Violation of Article 12(1)

In the absence of legal impediments to the implementation of the SOR of 2016, it is

observed that what hindered its implementation is the practical obstacle faced by the 1st

to 3rd Respondents due to the trade union action resorted to by the 6th Added-Respondent

Union as a strategic weapon, whenever the open competitive examination for recruiting

Railway Driver Assistants as per SOR 2016 was scheduled to be held. This fact is admitted

by the 3rd Respondent in his affidavit.

The Petitioners claim that their fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution which postulates that “All persons are equal before the law and are entitled

to the equal protection of the law,” has been violated by the 1st to 3rd Respondents’

arbitrary and unreasonable decisions to acquiesce to the demands of the 6th to 8th Added-

Respondents time and again and to repeatedly postpone the implementation of the SOR

of 2016, which has resulted in the following grievances (vide paragraphs 26-29 of the

Amended Petition):

I. due to no new recruitments being done and Driver Assistants being understaffed,

they have been overburdened by requiring to be on duty continuously for over a

week and denied their entitled off-days and nine-hour rest after an outstation

turn,

II. their legitimate expectation of promotion to the post of ‘Engine Driver (Shunting)’,

of which 30% of the vacancies are open to the Driver Assistants with 5 years of

satisfactory service, has been denied to them.

21

When inquiring as to whether the above grievances were caused by the decisions of the

1st to 3rd Respondents to postpone indefinitely and suspend recruitments under the SOR

of 2016, the following criteria should be borne in mind;

“In order to sustain the plea of discrimination based upon Article 12(1) a party will have

to satisfy the court about two things, namely (1) that he has been treated differently from

others, and (2) that he has been differently treated from persons similarly circumstanced

without any reasonable basis.” (C.W. Mackie and Co. Ltd v. Hugh Molagoda (supra) at

page 308)

It can be observed by the 1st Respondent’s letter to the Coordinating Secretary of the

President on 04th December 2017 (‘P19’) and the letter by 6th Added-Respondent Union

to the 1st to 3rd Respondents (‘8R-6’) that for maintaining the bare minimum railway

services during this period, Technical Assistants had to be employed to cover the duties

of ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ and retired Engine Driver Assistants had to be re-employed

on contract basis. Thus, the suspension of recruitments and non-implementation of the

SOR was prejudicing only the Petitioner ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ who were currently

in service.

Not only have the Petitioners been denied promotion and been overburdened in their

duties in contradistinction to the other railway employees, but the vacancies in their posts

have been filled by de facto upgrading untrained labour grade employees to that post and

rehiring retired employees through new contractual agreements due to the hesitation

and indecisiveness shown by the 1st to 3rd Respondents to go ahead with the

implementation of the SOR, without indulging the 6th Added-Respondent Union or

succumbing to the pressure exerted by them. This satisfies the first limb of the criteria in

C.W. Mackie and Co. Ltd (supra) that the Petitioners were treated differently from others.

Examining whether the Petitioners have been treated differently from similarly

circumstanced persons without a reasonable basis as per the second limb, it must be

noted that the 1st to 3rd Respondents have not sought a proactive and lasting solution to

this impasse created by the competing interests of two grades of its employees who are in

the same salary scale. They have instead merely favoured the claims of the 6th Added-

Respondent Union and yielded to the pressure wielded by the Engine Drivers’ Union,

22

while compromising the interests of the ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ in an ad-hoc and

arbitrary manner. They have effectively postponed/suspended the examinations four

times, once after scheduling it to be held on 26th August 2017 and again on 23rd

December 2017, even after the candidates had arrived at the examination centre, wasting

both time and resources at the tax-payers’ expense (paragraph 26 of the Petitioners’

counter affidavit).

As a result, the recruitment of new Railway Driver Assistants according to the SOR has

been arbitrarily and repeatedly suspended since the SOR’s approval on 29th September

2016 until the filing of this application on 22nd January 2018, and even up to the present

day, without a definite and immediate solution in sight. The failure of the 1st to 3rd

Respondents to address the concerns of the 6th Added-Respondent Union with a

considered solution when the disagreement first cropped up, and instead suspending

recruitments to the Petitioners’ post in an ad-hoc manner, has resulted in the current

impasse.

In their defence, the 3rd Respondent affirms in paragraph 8 of his affidavit that the 1st to

3rd Respondents have been compelled to take cognizance whenever the 6th Added-

Respondent Union struck work (which had assumed the ruse of salary anomalies to

interfere where they had no sufficient interest to interfere) “in order to minimize

disruption to railway services and the hardships faced by railway commuters thereby”.

Quite paradoxically, the repeated suspension of the recruitment process of Driver

Assistants, due to some of its terms being contested by the 6th Added-Respondent Union,

has only incurred additional costs and hardship to the Department of Railways and

compromised the efficiency of work and safety of the public, merely to sustain the bare

minimum service to the public. This course of action is further violative of Section 37 of

the Railways Ordinance, No. 1 of 1903 which binds all railway officials to do everything

necessary for ensuring the safety of the public. Thus, the second limb of the criteria in

C.W. Mackie and Co. Ltd (supra) is thereby substantiated.

It should also be noted that, although the Cabinet of Ministers’ policy decision dated 27th

April 2018 (‘IP16-B’) granted approval to implement all the observations included in the

‘Joint Cabinet Memorandum’ drafted pursuant to the Cabinet sub-committee inquiring

23

into this issue, allowing for the formulation of fresh SORs, its approval was “subject to

the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation taking action to convert the Department of

Sri Lanka Railways to a closed Department in future.” Furthermore, the Petitioners affirm

that these observations were based on misrepresented and one-sided facts, as the

Petitioners were only consulted in one meeting, while the sub-committee meetings had

continued only with the strikers (Paragraph 28 of counter-affidavit).

At this point it is apt to refer to the case of The Public Services United Nurses Union v.

Montague Jayewickrema, Minister of Public Administration and Others (1988) 1 SLR

229. This case, akin to the instant one, concerned two rival trade unions. The Petitioner

Union struck work demanding increase in salaries, but subsequently the strike was

settled and the strikers went back to work without loss of back pay and was taken back

unconditionally. However, after the strike, following the urging of the Respondent rival

nurses trade Union, the members of whom did not participate in the strike, were granted

a special ad-hoc benefit of two salary increments by a Cabinet decision, as a reward for

their non-participation and continued service during the strike.

Wanasundera J. stated in the above case that the ad-hoc benefit was especially crafted to

benefit members of one trade union to the detriment of those of another, giving one a

decided advantage over the other, even though up to now they have been equals. Quoting

from Roshan Lal v. Union of India AIR 1967 SC 1894, where it was stated that “The

emoluments of the Government servant and his terms of service are governed by statute

or statutory rules which may be unilaterally altered by the Government without the

consent of the employee”, Wanasundera J. opined that while there is no doubt of such

unilateral authority, “there still remains a question of form and procedure as to how it

should be done” (emphasis added).

Thereby, following this argument the Court held in The Public Services United Nurses

Union (supra) that,

“…there is no valid basis for granting these far-reaching benefits to a very

limited and narrow segment of public officers of the public service of this

country, or for imposing a disability or disadvantage on the rest. The matter

becomes all the more suspect when we find that the benefits of this proposal

24

accrue primarily to officers of a particular union… The wage structure of the

public service is of utmost interest both to the officers concerned and the general

public and its importance is seen by the fact that revisions and alterations are

made only after the most careful consideration and after a thorough hearing of

the views of all categories of public officers.” (at pages 238, 239, emphasis

added)

In the instant case, the Petitioners- ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ and the 6th to 8th Added-

Respondents- ‘Engine Drivers (Shunting)’ were both placed in the same category of

‘Management Assistant Technical-Segment 3’ and both were assigned the salary scale

code MT 1-2006(A) by the SOR of 2010. The ‘Engine Drivers (Shunting)’ were, however,

placed higher, albeit in the same salary scale, in recognition of and commensurate with

the additional level of responsibility on the Engine Drivers. This wage structure

pertaining to ‘Railway Driver Assistants’ was unchanged by the SOR approved by the PSC

in 2016. Therefore, it is evident that, in terms of grade and salary scale, the two are

equals.

In such a backdrop, the suspension and non-implementation of the legally valid Scheme

of Recruitment approved in 2016, by the 1st to 3rd Respondents places the Petitioners in

a disadvantaged position against their equal as well as other railway employees, and

frustrate their legitimate expectations of promotion as per the terms of the SOR. As such,

the non-implementation of the SOR of 2016 by the 1st to 3rd Respondents is violative of

the Petitioners’ Fundamental Right to equality before the law and equal protection of the

law.

Until such time as the proposed changes are brought about and fresh SORs are prepared,

the prevailing situation, naturally, cannot be sustained without causing serious harm to

the safety of the railway commuters, as well as the functioning of the railway service.

I need not state in express terms that the railway service is supported by public funds and

at a significant cost to the public. Every railway employee has to bear in mind that they

are compensated by the public with the expectation of providing an essential service to

them. It is no enigma that it is the masses who mainly rely on the railway system to

commute and there is an ethical and a moral duty cast on all the railway employees to

25

make every endeavour to offer the service to the discerning general public without a

disruption, to the best of their ability. It is in that spirit that they are expected to discharge

their responsibilities. In the instant case, the 6th Added-Respondent Union have left out

the paramount duty they owe to the very society that maintain them, which to my mind

is unfortunate, to say the least.

In this regard, I wholeheartedly concur with the opinion expressed by Justice F.N.D.

Jayasuriya in Best Footwear (Pvt) Ltd. and Two Others v. Aboosally, Former Minister of

Labour & Vocational Training and Others (1997) 2 SLR 137 at page 151:

“It is a trite proposition that since the commencement and the continuance of a strike has

an adverse effect upon production and upon the industry and because it may ultimately

lead to a closure of manufacturing establishments, this weapon of a strike ought to be

used as a last resort when all other avenues for settlement of industrial disputes have

proved to be futile and fruitless. In the circumstances, Courts of law by their orders ought

to discourage the misuse of strikes and to control and minimise the deleterious and

harmful consequences of its misuse in respect of industries as far as possible so that the

economy of the country would not be adversely affected. I hold that the strike in this case

has not been utilised as a last resort and this hasty and ill-considered decision to strike

has caused cessation of production, considerable financial loss and detriment to the

employer and an adverse effect on the economy of the country for which all blame must

be imputed to the trade union in question” (emphasis added).

Considering the above I hold that the non- implementation of the SOR of 2016 (‘P9’) has

resulted in a violation of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners and accordingly

declare that the Petitioner’s Fundamental Right enshrined in Article 12(1) has been

violated in the instant situation by the State. Although 1st to 3rd Respondents were

responsible for implementing the SOR, it appears they were hamstrung in doing so due

to various factors beyond their control and as such court does not hold them responsible

individually.

I also observe that the implementation of the SOR of 2016 applicable to the ‘Railway

Driver Assistants’ does not in any way impinge on the rights of the 6th to 8th Added-

Respondents or the members of the ‘Railway Locomotive Operating Engineers’ Union’

26

represented by them, as such they should not take any action to hinder the

implementation of the SOR of 2016 (‘P9’).

Earlier in this judgement I have referred to the numerous difficulties the Railway

Department is facing as a result of not being able to fill the vacancies of Railway Driver

Assistants. Bearing in mind such complications and the disruption caused by this impasse

to the public railway transport system- over which the Sri Lanka Railway Department

holds a monopoly- the 1st to 3rd Respondents or their successors are directed to take all

necessary steps to implement the SOR of 2016 (‘P9’) forthwith, and to report the progress

of the action taken in that regard to this court on the 30th November 2020. This directive,

however, is to be carried out subject to any budgetary constraints the State might be

facing.

In the circumstances of this case, this court does not award compensation or order costs.

Application allowed.
