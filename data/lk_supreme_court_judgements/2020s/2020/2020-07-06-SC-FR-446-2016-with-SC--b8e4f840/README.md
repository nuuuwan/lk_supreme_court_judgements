Decided on: 06.07.2020

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

SC FR 227/16 and SC FR 446/16 were taken up for argument together on a decision of this court,

made when SC FR 446/16 was supported for leave to proceed on 31.03.2017.

Out of the two applications, SC FR 227/16 was supported for leave on 13.01.2017. On that day court

after considering the submissions of both parties, granted leave to proceed for the alleged violation

of the Petitioner’s Fundamental Rights enshrined on Article 12 (1) of the Constitution with interim

relief as prayed in paragraph (b) to prayer of the Petition dated 1st July 2016 to the effect;

“that the Respondents not to fill the existing vacancies for the post of Deputy Commissioner

of Provincial Revenue Service of the Western Province until the final hearing and

determination of this application”

The next application before us, namely SC FR 446/ 2016 was filed before the Supreme Court along

with a motion dated 14th December 2016 (one month prior to the application 227/16 was supported)

and in this application the Petitioner alleged violation of the Petitioner’s Fundamental Rights

guaranteed under Article 12 (1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution by not promoting her to the vacant

post of the Deputy Commissioner Class 1 of the Provincial Revenue Service of the Western Province.

This matter too was supported for leave to proceed before this court 27.03.2017 and leave to

proceed was granted.

When considering the violations alleged by the two Petitioners it is observed that the position taken

up by the two Petitioners in their complaints before this court, are not the same but are exactly the

opposite of the other. In this background this court will be considering the material in each case

separately and in granting the final relief this court will be mindful of the said positions taken by both

parties.

11 After the leave to proceed had been granted in SC FR 446/16, the Petitioner in SC FR 227/16 made

an attempt to intervene in SC FR 446/16, but the said request was turned down by this court on

10.10.2018 but allowed both matters to be taken up for hearing together before the same bench.

In the meantime, two Intervenient Petitioners filed papers in SC FR 227/16 for intervention and the

said application was allowed by his court on 01.10.2019.

Position taken by the Petitioner in SC FR 227/2016

The Petitioner in SC FR 227/16 was a Senior Assessor [Class II Grade I] belongs to the Provincial

Revenue Service and was attached to the Department of the Provincial Revenue of the Western

Province. Having joined the said service as a Tax Officer in the year 1996, he was promoted to the

post of Senior Tax Officer in the year 2001. With effect from 01.12.2004 he was promoted to the post

of Assessor and was promoted as Senior Assessor with effect from 1st December 2010. According to

the Petitioner his next promotion would be to the post of Deputy Commissioner which is a Class I

position.

On 30th April 2015 a vacancy occurred in the post of Deputy Commissioner of the Western Provincial

Revenue Service at Gampaha office and the Petitioner being the most Senior Assessor in the said

service of the Western Province having the required post graduate qualification, preferred an

application to the 6th Respondent through the head of his Department. (P-12)

However the 1st Respondent by letter dated 20th October 2015 addressed to the Petitioner, had

informed him, that the Petitioner’s request to hold an interview to consider his application to fill the

existing vacancy of Deputy Commissioner would not arise since the filling of vacancies in the said

cadre is done in terms of Clause 9.1 of the existing service minute. (P-13C)

In this regard Petitioner had further submitted that the filling of vacancy in the cadre of Deputy

Commissioner in terms of Clause 9.1 of the existing service minute is completely based on seniority

12 alone, and therefore it is not in conformity with the terms of Public Administrative Circular 6 of 2006

and in the said circumstances he lodged a complaint at the Human Rights Commission. (P-14A)

In support of his contention, Petitioner had produced the existing service minute of the Provincial

Revenue Service of the Western Province marked P-8, a covering letter addressed to Deputy

Commissioners Colombo, Maharagama, Kalutara, Gampaha and Stamp Division by the Provincial

Revenue Commissioner Western Province dated 11.07.2013 marked P-10 and the annexed draft

service minute for the Provincial Revenue Service -Western Province marked P-10B, a model scheme

of recruitment by the National Pay Commission marked P-11A and a letter dated 02.01.2016

addressed to the Provincial Revenue Commissioner from the Chief Secretary of the Western Province

under the heading “niakysr m<df;a wdodhï fiajd jHjia:dj rdcH mrsmd,k pl%f,aL 06$2006 wkqj

.e,mSu” marked P-17.

According to P-8, the existing service minute, procedure in promotion to the post of Class I Deputy

Commissioner is identified under section 9 as follows;

“I mka;sfha ksfhdacHh flduidrsia ;k;=rg Wiia lsrSu

In P-17, the Chief Secretary of the Western Province had observed the lapses in the above provision

as follows;

According to P-10B the draft service minute circulated for calling observation from the Deputy

Commissioner on 11.07.2013, measures were already recommended for the lapses identified by the

Chief Secretary in the year 2017, in the following manner.

Whilst adverting to the requirements under Public Administration Circular 6 of 2006, the Petitioner

had further submitted that the 1st Respondent and his predecessors and the 6th Respondent had

taken steps to implement the provisions of the Public Administration Circular 6/2006 within the

Western Province with regard salary structures in compatible with the salaries of the employee of

the Central Government and took up the position that it is the duty of the 1st and the 6th Respondent

to implement the rest of the requirements under the said circular.

14 In this regard I am mindful of the decision by this court in Kamalawathie and Others Vs. The

Provincial Public Service Commission, North-Western Province and Others (2001) 1 Sri LR 1 where

Fernando (J) had observed,

“While powers in respect of education have been devolved to provincial councils, those

powers must be exercised in conformity with national policy. Once national policy has been

duly formulated in respect of any subject, there cannot be any conflicting provincial policy on

that subject.”

As further observed by me, the Respondent before this court, did not challenged the requirement to

implement the provisions of Public Administration Circular 6 of 2006 within the Western Province

but took up the position that there is a delay in implementing some of the provisions of the said

circular.

The 1st Respondent had responded to the complaint of the Petitioner in the following manner.

a) The new salary structure introduced subsequent to the Public Administration Circular 6/2006

was included in the new service minute dated 7th April 2009 which had been duly approved

by the Governor of the Western Province under section 32 of the Provincial Councils Act (IRI)

b) At the time of the new service minute being introduced, the guidelines pertaining to service

minutes were not issued by the Public Service Commission.

c) At the time the said service minute was implemented pursuant to Public Administration

Circular 6 of 2006, there was no requirement to submit it before the National Pay Commission

or the National Salaries and cadre Commission for their approval.

d) According to section 9 of the said service minute the appointment of Deputy Commissioner

Class I was based on Seniority only.

e) Secretary to the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils by letter dated

10.06.2013 informed the Chief Secretaries of all the Provinces to submit their observations

15

and recommendations to a draft service minute submitted by the Southern Provincial Council

and the Chief Secretary of the Western Province by letter dated 05.07.2013 forwarded the

said document to the 1st Respondent for his observations (IR2)

f) P-10B the said document was circulated among the officers of the Provincial Revenue Service

by P10A

g) A daft service minute agreed by the Trade Unions and all the Provincial Revenue

Commissioners was submitted to the Deputy Chief Secretary by letter dated 16.07.2013 (IR3

or IR3A)

h) Since then a large number of letters were exchange between several Government agencies

including the office of the Chief Secretary Western Province, 1st Respondent, Secretary to the

Western Province Governor, Department of Management Service, but until the vacancy in

question occurred, i.e. the vacancy of Deputy Commissioner Provincial Revenue Service-

Gampaha, there was no finality to the service minute of the Revenue Service of the Western

Provincial Council (IR4-IRII )

i) In the said circumstances, the service minute introduced on 07.04 2009 was the only service

minute which was in operation by that date.

j) The petitioner had submitted an application through his Superior Officer (i.e. Deputy

Commissioner Revenue Service of the Western Province-Maharagama) for the above vacancy

requesting to hold an interview, (P-12) but by letter dated 28.10.2015, 1st Respondent had

informed the Petitioner that there is no requirement to hold an interview under the

provisions of the prevailing service minute and that he had already submitted his

recommendation to fill the said vacancy (P-I3C)

16

k) Based on the prevailing service minute, the name of the Most Senior Officer in Class II Grade

I, one Mrs. K. N. K. de Silva’s (Petitioner in SC FR 446/16) name was recommended to the

above post by letter dated 02.04.2015 (IR28)

l) On the directives received from the Chief Secretary, an application received from the said

Mrs. K. N. K. de Silva for the above post was forwarded to the Chief Secretary along with the

seniority list of the Officers of the Provincial Revenue Service (IR30 and IR31). According to

IR31 the Petitioners seniority was observed 8 positions below Mrs. K. N. K. de Silva. The said

recommendation was approved by the Provincial Public Service until a permanent

appointment is made, subject to 3 months acting with effect from 30.04.2015 and thereafter

covering up the duties of the said post. (IR32)

As revealed before this Court, even up to the date the instant case was taken up for hearing, the

service minute of the Revenue Service of the Western Province has not been amended to include

the necessary amendments required under public Administration Circular 06/2006, including the

amendment for the promotion from Grade II to Grade I, even though the Chief Secretary Western

Province had observed several lapses and given directions to the 1st Respondent by letter dated

02.01.2016 (P-17).

The 1st Respondent in his affidavit filed before this court on 23rd October 2017 had taken up the

position that by 10.03.2016 he had duly submitted the report by the Chief Secretary in order to

amend the prevailing service minute but as revealed before us, so far the service minute had not

been amended.

Position taken by the Petitioner in SC FR 446/2016

The Petitioner in SC FR 446/2016 was the Most Senior Assessor (Class II Grade I) belonging to the

Provincial Revenue Service -Western Province at the time a vacancy had occurred in the post of

Deputy Commissioner (Class I) of the Western Provincial Revenue Service on 29.04.2015.

17 As submitted by the Petitioner, by 2nd April 2015, the 1st Respondent had written the 3rd Respondent,

Chief Secretary of the Western Provincial Council with a copy to the 4th Respondent, the Secretary

to the Western Provincial Public Service Commission, that there will be vacancy in the Post of Deputy

Commissioner of the Western Provincial Revenue Service and recommending the Most Senior Officer

in Class II Grade I with a satisfactory service, namely the Petitioner, under section 9.1 of the service

minute of the Western Provincial Revenue Service (P-7). Several letters exchanged with regard to the

filling of the said vacancy was produced marked P-8 to P-14 by the Petitioner before this court.

The Petitioner was appointed to the Post of Deputy Commissioner in the Provincial Revenue Service

until a permanent appointment is made, subject to 3 months acting and thereafter on a covering up

basis with effect from 30.04.2015 by 1R32 filed along with the objection in the Fundamental Rights

application SC FR 227/2016 and I have already referred to the above in this Judgment.

The Petitioner dissatisfied with her not being appointed to the permanent cadre under section 9.1

of the service minute of the Provincial Revenue Service of the Western Province, had first complaint

to the Human Rights Commission and thereafter filed the instant application for alleged violation

under Article 12 (1) and 14 (1) of the Constitution.

However as referred to in this Judgment, by the time the instant application was filed,

SC FR 227/2016 had already been filed and leave to proceed had been granted on 03.01.2017 with

an interim order preventing the filling of vacancy in the cadre of Deputy Commissioner of Provincial

Revenue Service in Western Province. When the instant application was supported for leave to

proceed on 27.03.2017, the said interim order was in operation.

Both the Petitioners is SC FR 227/2016 and SC FR 446/2016 argued legitimate expectation of them

being appointed to the post of Deputy Commissioner in the Provincial Revenue Service, with the

vacancy occurred in the said service with effect from 30.04.2015.

18 The Petitioner in SC FR 227/2016 claimed legitimate expectation on state policy that required an

amendment to the remaining scheme of Recruitment and the draft scheme of Recruitment which

was in the calculation since 2013.

However, the positions of the Petitioner in SC FR 446/2016 was based on the Scheme of Recruitment

which was in operation at the time the vacancy occurred, since she was the most senior officer in

Class II Grade I with a satisfactory service.

In the case of Siriwardana Vs. Seneviratne and Others SC FR 589/2009 SC minute dated 10.03.2011

and 2011 [2] BLR 336 Shirani Bandaranayake J (as she then was) observed the following

requirements in identifying the presence of legitimate expectation in alleged violation of Article

12 (1) of the Constitution

a) A careful consideration of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, clearly shows that, whether

an expectation is legitimate or not is a question of fact. This has to be decided not only on

the basis of the application made by the aggrieved party before court, but also taking into

consideration whether there had been any arbitrary exercise of power by the administrative

authority in question.

b) Accordingly, the question that would have to be looked into would be as to whether there

was a promise given to the Petitioner or a regular procedure that future vacancies would be

filled on the basis of a previously held examination on which there had been selectins made

on the results of the said examination

c) The applicability of the doctrine of legitimate expectation imposes in essence a duty to act

fairly

d) More hope or an expectation cannot be treated as having a legitimate expectation.

19 In the case of Kurukulasooriya Vs. Edirisinghe and Others SC FR 577/209 SC Minute 23.02.2011 and

2012 BLR 66 Shirani Bandaranayake J (as she then was) had further observed;

“Legitimate expectation has been described as a concept which derives from an undertaking

given by someone in authority. There is no compulsion for such an undertaking to be in

written formula, but would be sufficient if that could be known through the surrounding

circumstances.”

In the absence of any promise or undertaking that the draft Scheme of Recruitment would give effect

to, at the time the vacancy occurred, it is also important to consider the effect of the draft Scheme

of Recruitment with the employees who will be affected by the said draft, if it is implemented by

the employer. The above position was considered in the case of,

In R (Bancoult) Vs. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) [2008] 61,

[2009] 1 AC 465 as follows;

“The legitimate expectation may entail either

1) No more than that the decision-maker will take his existing policy into account or

2) An obligation on the decision-maker to consult those affected before changing his

policy or

3) An obligation for the decision-maker to confer a substantive benefit on an

identified person or group

Those categories represent an ascending hierarchy which must be reflected in the precision,

clarity and irrevocability of any alleged representation or promise on which the expectation

is said to be based, to rely successfully on a substantive expectation a claimed must be able

to show that the promise was ambiguous, clear and devoid of relevant qualification, that it

20

was made in favour of an individual or small group of persons affected; that it was reasonable

for the claimant to rely on it, and that he did rely on it generally, but not invariably, to his

detriment.”

This position was once again considered by this court in Dayarathne Vs. Minister of Health and

Indigenous Medicine [1999] 1 Sri LR 393 as follows;

“When a change of policy is likely to frustrate the legitimate expectations of individuals, they

must be given an opportunity of stating why the change of policy should not affect them

unfavourably. Such procedural rights have an important bearing on the protection afforded

by Article 12 of the Constitution against unequal treatments arbitrarily, invidiously,

irrationally or otherwise unreasonably dealt out by the Executive.”

When considering the matters already discussed in this Judgment it is observed by me that the

legitimate expectation, the Petitioner in SC FR 227/2016 relied upon, is a mere expectation based on

the change of policy, which was not implemented at the time the vacancy occurred. His claim that

the Respondents have failed to implement the said recommendations, has no bearing on his case

before us. In these circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner in SC FR 227/2016 has failed to establish

his case before this court.

As further discussed in this Judgment, at the time the Petitioner in SC FR 446/2016 has supported

her case before this court, SC FR 227/2016 had already been supported and a stay order preventing

the Respondents (are same in both cases) filling the existing vacancy for the post of Deputy

Commissioner- Provincial Revenue Service, and the said vacancy could not be filled pending SC FR

227/2016 before this court. As further submitted by the Respondents in SC FR 446/2016 before this

court, the 1st Respondent had in fact recommended the name of the Petitioner in SC FR 446/2016

being the most Senior Officer in Class II Grade I with a satisfactory service to fill the said vacancy. In

21 these circumstances I see no basis to conclude that the Respondents before us had acted in violation

of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Petitioner in SC FR 446/2016.

Both Applications before this court are accordingly dismissed.

The Petitioners to bear their costs.
