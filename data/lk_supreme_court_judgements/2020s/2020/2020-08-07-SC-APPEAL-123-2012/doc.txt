The Accused - Appellant - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant)

stood charged in the Magistrate’s Court of Kesbewa on seven counts. The said seven

counts respectively alleged that the appellant on or about 08-12-1999, had;

I. assaulted Yukinori Kyuma with hand and thereby committed an offence punishable

under Section 314 of the Penal Code;

II. abetted Chinthaka alias D. C. R. Wanigasekara to assault Kyoko Kyuma and thereby

committed an offence punishable under Section 314 read with 102 of the Penal

Code;

III. wrongfully confined Yukinori Kyuma and thereby committed an offence punishable

under Section 333 of the Penal Code;

IV. used criminal force to Yukinori Kyuma and thereby committed an offence

punishable under Section 343 of the Penal Code;

V. abetted Chinthaka alias D. C. R. Wanigasekara to commit the offence of robbery of

a camera from the possession of Kyoko Kyuma and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 380 read with section 102 of the Penal Code;

VI. used criminal force to Kyoko Kyuma and thereby committed an offence punishable

under section 343 of the Penal Code;

VII. abetted Chinthaka alias D. C. R. Wanigasekara to commit the offence of mischief

by breaking the door of the Directors’ room of Ceylon M. K. N. Ecopower (pvt) Ltd.

and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 409 read with section

102 of the Penal Code.

The Appellant had pleaded not guilty to all the above charges and hence the learned

Magistrate had taken steps to conduct and conclude the trial against him.

In the trial, the prosecution led evidence of four witnesses namely;

i. Kyoko Kyuma, (daughter)

4 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

ii. Yukinara Kyuma, (father)

iii. Police Sergeant (PS 4481) Abdul Aziz Mohomed Mihilar,

iv. Woman Police Constable (RWPC 651) Iluksuriya Arachchige Dayawathie.

After the prosecution closed its case, the Appellant had given evidence under oath. The

defence also led evidence of two other witnesses namely;

i. Udawattage Don Kamal Chandrasiri,

ii. Anoma Upendranath Walpola.

Learned Magistrate at the conclusion of the trial, pronounced the judgment dated 28-06-

2002, acquitting the Appellant from all of the above charges.

Being aggrieved, by the said judgment of the learned Magistrate, the Aggrieved Party -

Appellant - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Aggrieved Party) had

appealed to the Provincial High Court. The Provincial High Court of Western Province

holden at Panadura, by its judgment dated 04-04-2008 had set aside the judgment of

the learned Magistrate and ordered a re-trial to be conducted against the Appellant. The

Appellant, in this appeal, seeks to canvass before this Court the said judgment of the

Provincial High Court.

Upon the Appellant supporting the application for special leave to appeal relevant to this

appeal, this Court by its order dated 12-07-2012, had granted special leave to appeal on

the following question of law.1

“Having regard to the evidence of this case, including the medical evidence and

the history given by the parties to the Medical Officer, is the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge setting aside the order of acquittal manifestly erroneous

in law?”

In order to answer the above question of law, it would be necessary to turn, albeit briefly,

to the evidence adduced before Court in this case.

1 Question of law set out in paragraph 13(a) of the petition dated 15-05-2008.

5 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

The following facts have been revealed from the evidence of the prosecution witness No.

02, Yukinara Kyuma (father).

I. He came to reside in Sri Lanka in 1997.

II. He, along with the Appellant and one Noriko functioned as Directors of the company

named ‘Ceylon MKN Eco Power (Pvt) Ltd.’

III. The Appellant functioned as the Chief Officer in the office of the said company

situated in Piliyandala.

IV. On 07-12-1999, at about 8 PM he along with his wife, Kyoko, Noriko, Sumuko and

driver Jagath went to the said office.

V. As there is a case filed by the Appellant regarding a dispute in the company, which

was pending in the Supreme Court, he collected the important documents, kept it

in the Director’s room of the office, and locked it.

VI. Around 8.30 AM on the following day, he along with his daughter Kyoko went to

the said office in Piliyandala.

VII. When they entered, the watcher and driver Jagath were there.

VIII. Around 9 AM, another girl came to the office. Thereafter the Appellant along with

several other people also came to the office. At that time, he and his daughter were

in the main office.

IX. The Appellant can speak Japanese language well but he can speak Sinhala language

only a very little.

X. The Appellant had told that his belongings are also in the locked up room and

wanted him to open the locked up room.

XI. When the Appellant assisted by the others with him, attempted to break open the

door of the locked up room, he went in front of the said door and stood right in

front of it with a view to prevent the said attempt. At that time, the Appellant

assaulted him and that resulted in his pair of spectacles getting thrown away. He

6 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

then picked up his pair of spectacles and continued to stay in front of the door of

the locked up room. At that time, the Appellant assisted by the others (who came

with the Appellant), dragged him away and forcibly made him sit on a chair. He

then saw his daughter trying to video record the act of breaking open the door.

Then Chinthaka, upon being instructed by the Appellant, grabbed the video camera

from his daughter. They then sent his daughter and driver Jagath out of the door

and locked the main door. After about twenty minutes, officers from the Piliyandala

Police Station came to the scene. Yukinara states that he does not know English

language. He had observed that there were bleeding injuries on his face and on

the small finger of his right hand. The Medico Legal Report was produced marked

P 4.

He had identified the Appellant as the person who assaulted him. During the cross-

examination also, this witness has re-iterated the sequence of events in the same way

he had testified in his evidence in chief.

The prosecution witness No. 01, Kyoko Kyuma (daughter) in her evidence has stated that

she knows the Appellant as one of the partners in business with his father. The said

business was with regard to generation of hydropower electricity and the name of the

company engaged in the said business is ‘Ceylon MKN Eco Power (Pvt) Ltd.’ She states

that her father (Yukinara) functioned as the chairman and the Appellant and her sister

Noriko Kyuma functioned as the other directors of the said company.

She states that acting on the advice given by their Attorney-at-Law, she along with her

father, mother, sister, and the driver went to the office of the said company in Piliyandala

on 07-12-1999. They thereafter collected all the important documents, kept them in the

Director’s room in the said office, locked the said room, and left the office.

At about 9 AM on the following day morning, she along with her father came back to the

said office. She had seen an engineer by the name of Walpola also present near the gate.

Although said Walpola wanted to come along with them into the office, they had not

permitted him to come in. When she and her father were waiting in the office, the

Appellant along with Walpola, Chinthaka, driver Kamal and the driver working for the

Appellant had come to the office.

7 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

Thereafter, as the Appellant had wanted them to open the door of the locked up room

an argument between her father and the Appellant had ensued. However, she and her

father had refused to open the locked up room. At that time the Appellant with the help

of the others who came with him, had made preparations to break open the door. When

her father attempted to stop it, the Appellant had assaulted him with his hand. Her father

had gone near the door and stood in front of it, to prevent the break opening. It was at

that time that the Appellant assaulted her father on his face. She had then telephoned

the Police. As she tried to defend her father, somebody in the crowd had assaulted her

also. However, she has not identified the person who had assaulted her. On the

instructions of the Appellant, the persons in the group of the Appellant had forcibly held

her father seated on a chair rendering him immobilized.

As she tried to video record the incident that was taking place, Chinthaka on being

instructed by the Appellant, had assaulted her, dragged her out of the main door, pushed

her out of the door, and then locked the said main door. Her driver Jagath was also

pushed out of the same door in the same way. After some time, Police came to the scene

and took all of them to the Police Station. The Medico Legal Report in respect of the

examination of this witness was produced marked P 2.

Answering the questions posed to her in cross-examination, this witness also has

reaffirmed her evidence on the main points in the same way. She has reiterated in cross

examination that she saw her father being assaulted by the Appellant and was held

immobilized forcibly.

PS 4481 Abdul Aziz Mohammed Mihilar is the police officer who had gone to the place of

the incident around 10 AM on 08-12-1999 as he was instructed to do so on a Walkie-

talkie, by Piliyandala Police Station. He along with RPC 18608 Navaratne and the driver

of the vehicle had gone to the address No. 202, Suwarapola, Moratuwa Road, Piliyandala.

He then had observed the scene of the incident. He had observed that the lock of the

room had been broken. He also had observed injuries on Yukinara (father). He also had

observed that Yukinara’s shirt had been torn and his tie had been pulled out. He had

observed the presence of the Appellant, Shammi Ramani Cooray, Chinthaka

Wanigasekera, A U Walpola, Indika Atapattu, drivers Kamal Chandrasiri and Jagath at

8 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

that place at that time. According to his observations, Yukinara Kyuma did not appear to

be normal.

RWPC 651 Iluksuriyaarachchige Dayawathie has entered the complaint produced by

Kyoko Kyuma (daughter) written in English on 08-12-1999. She had issued medico-legal

examination forms to both Kyuko Kyuma and Yukinara Kyuma and recorded the

statements of the others present. She also arrested the Appellant on the instructions of

the officer in charge of the crimes branch of the Police Station. She had also recorded

the statements of Shammi Cooray who worked as the Accountant, Anoma Upendranath

Walpola who functioned as the Electrical Engineer, Chinthaka Wanigasekera who

functioned as the Mechanical Engineer, Indika Sanjeewani Atapattu who functioned as a

clerk of the relevant organization.

After the prosecution closed its case, the Appellant Dehigaspe Patabendige Nishantha

Nanayakkara also has given evidence. The next paragraph would consist of the summary

of his evidence before Court.

The Appellant had admitted establishing ‘Ceylon Eco Power (Pvt) Ltd’ company along with

Yukinara and establishing the office in Piliyandala. On 08-12-1999 at about 8.30 AM

Engineer Walpola had informed him that Yukinara along with another person had come

to the office in Piliyandala. Walpola also had alerted him about the existence of somewhat

dangerous situation at the said office. Upon the receipt of the above information, the

Appellant had proceeded to the office with his driver. Thereafter, the Appellant along with

Walpola, driver Kamal and another employee Chinthaka had opened the gate and entered

the office. He had found his room sealed and locked by placing a new lock on the door.

He has also found that documents had been removed from the office. He had observed

the word ‘Kyuma’ written in Japanese language on the seal. The Appellant had tried to

enter the locked room but Yukinara stood guard in front of the door blocking and

preventing access of the room to the Appellant. The Appellant then instructed the others

to open the door of the room. Then Chinthaka and Nimal came and attempted to open

the door. As Yukinara intervened against opening the door, they had forcibly dragged

him and forced him to sit on a chair. Thereafter, Chinthaka and Nimal had forced open

the door. According to the Appellant, it was in the course of the said melee that Yukinara

9 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

had sustained injuries. The Appellant also has stated that he had instructed Chinthaka to

take the video camera from Koyoko (daughter) and he saw her going out of the office

though the door. He also had seen her calling the Police. Police had arrived after about

12 minutes. The Appellant states that thereafter all of them went to the police station

and Police subsequently arrested him and recorded a statement.

The Appellant denies having assaulted Yukinara, he also denies that Yukinara was

assaulted by anybody else in his group. It is the Appellant’s position that he used force

on Yukinara when he attempted to block the break opening of the door.

Udawattage Don Kamal Chandrasiri who worked as a driver of the relevant company also

had given evidence on behalf of the Appellant. This witness having narrated the incident

had stated that the locked up room had got broken open when Nimal and Chinthaka

pushed its door. According to this witness, Yukinara at that time had jumped towards the

door. It was at that time Yukinara’s finger had got entangled in the lock, which caused

the injury on his finger. Chandrasiri had also stated that Jagath pulled from Yukinara’s tie

and pulled him away. He had seen Koyoko (daughter) raising the video camera which

was in her hand. On being instructed by the Appellant, Chandrasiri had grabbed the video

camera from Koyoko’s hand and kept it elsewhere. Police had arrived after some time.

Chandrasiri had observed injuries on Yukinara’s finger and face.

Anoma Upendranath Walpola, who works as the Electrical Engineer of this company, also

had given evidence on behalf of the Appellant. Having narrated the incident, he has stated

that they had opened the locked door on the instructions of the Appellant. According to

Walpola, Yukinara had attempted to block the opening of the door and it was in that

process that Yukinara’s finger had got injured as the finger had got entangled in the lock.

Walpola also has stated that Chinthaka grabbed the video camera from the hand of

Koyoko (daughter) on the instructions of the Appellant as she had attempted to video

record the incident at that time.

The question in respect of which this Court has granted special leave to appeal to wit,

“Having regard to the evidence of this case, including the medical evidence and the

history given by the parties to the Medical Officer, is the judgment of the learned High

10 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

Court Judge setting aside the order of acquittal manifestly erroneous in law?” would ex-

facie be a question of fact as it revolves solely around facts of the case namely the

evidence adduced by parties in the case. However, the said question would become a

question of law only if the conclusion of the learned High Court Judge is found to be

perverse. Therefore, I would endeavor to answer the said question within the above

parameters.

Since the question in respect of which this Court has granted special leave to appeal has

a reference to the consideration of medical evidence and the short history given by the

victim, I would at this juncture briefly set out the medical evidence adduced in this case.

The Medico Legal Report (MLR) of Yukinara Kiyuma has been produced marked P 4 in

the course of the trial. The short history given by the patient in the said MLR is recorded

as “assaulted by 7 people with hands & feet on 8/12/99 around 9.10 AM at Piliyandala.”

The said MLR has confirmed that Yukinara had sustained following two injuries.

1) ½ cm abrasion about 1 ½ cm lateral to the left eye

2) 1 cm abrasion in the dorsal aspect of the distal phalanx of second (2nd ) finger

of right hand.

Thus, the aforesaid oral evidence adduced in this case, taken in to consideration together

with the above medical evidence and the short history to the Medical Officer, shows

clearly that this is not a case where the assertion of the witnesses cannot be supported

by the medical evidence. This is because the injuries observed by the Medical Officer on

Yukinara’s body match with the oral account of the incident narrated by the witnesses in

the trial.

Further, the consideration of evidence summarized above (including the medical

evidence) in the backdrop of the charges set out in the charge sheet clearly shows that

there is evidence against the Appellant. It can also be seen that the evidence adduced

by the defence is not at substantial variance with that adduced by the prosecution. The

main position taken up by the defence in this case is that this incident had sparked off as

a result of actions of Yukinara in locking up the office room. It can be seen that the most

11 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

of the facts have been admitted by the defence in the course of the evidence they had

adduced.

In spite of the presence of aforementioned evidence, the learned Magistrate had

concluded that he was not prepared to accept that there has been an assault in view of

the fact that the prosecution has not explained as to how these injuries were caused. In

contradistinction to the above conclusion, it can be seen towards the end of the judgment

that the learned Magistrate from the same breath has also concluded that there has been

an incident between the Appellant and the prosecution witnesses and that Yukinara could

have been injured in the course of that incident.

The learned Magistrate has also concluded that the prosecution has not proved the fact

that Yukinara was unlawfully restrained. In coming to this conclusion, the learned

Magistrate has taken the view that both Yukinara and Koyoko should have jointly seen

what each of them had separately narrated in Court. This in my view is against the

principle enunciated in the case of Bandaranaike V Jagathsena and others 2 where this

Court has taken the view that when version of two witnesses do not agree the trial judge

has to consider whether the discrepancy is due to dishonesty or to defective memory or

whether in the witness’ powers of observation were limited.3 Moreover, it appears that

the learned Magistrate has lost sight of the fact that the Appellant also in his evidence

has stated that they had forcibly dragged Yukinara and forced him to sit on a chair to

prevent his intervention against opening the locked up room.

It appears to me from the judgment of the learned Magistrate that he has not taken into

consideration the evidence adduced by the defence before he came to the conclusion

that the prosecution has not proved its case. Moreover, it also appears that the Magistrate

had failed to assess, evaluate and appreciate the evidence adduced in the trial as a whole.

In spite of the presence of an abrasion on Yukinara’s face, the move by the learned

Magistrate to look for injuries that are more specific to hold that an assault had taken

place would in my view be unrealistic in the light of the facts of this case.

2 1984 (2) SLR 397. 3 Ibid. at page 415.

12 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

In these circumstances, I am unable to find any acceptable basis, which could have

enabled the learned Magistrate to acquit the Appellant from all the charges. Therefore, I

am unable to hold that the conclusion by the learned High Court Judge that she cannot

agree with the judgment of the learned Magistrate in acquitting the Appellant from all

the charges is a perverse conclusion. Although there are other grounds to support my

conclusion I would desist from referring to any more of them in this judgment as I am

mindful that the Magistrate after this judgment will be called upon to consider and

evaluate the available evidence afresh and pronounce a fresh judgment. Therefore, I

would not proceed any further to deal with or pronounce any view on the evaluation of

evidence adduced by both parties at the trial.

Further, presumably for the same reason, the learned High Court Judge too had not

pronounced any opinion on the evaluation of evidence adduced at the trial by both

parties. It is therefore unnecessary for me to embark on the step of evaluation of evidence

adduced at the trial by both parties, as my task would be limited to the ascertainment

whether the judgment of the learned High Court Judge setting aside the order of acquittal

by the learned Magistrate is manifestly erroneous in law.

As has already been indicated, in view of the fact that I am inclined to affirm the judgment

of the learned High Court Judge setting aside the learned Magistrate’s judgment, I would

conclude this judgment with the following quotation from the Indian case of State of Uttar

Pradesh V M K Anthony.4 The Supreme Court of India in that case held as follows.

“ … while appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the

evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Once that

impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinize the evidence

more particularly keeping in view of the deficiencies, draw-backs and infirmities pointed

out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the

general tenor of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of

the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies of trivial

matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences

torn out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching importance to some

4 A I R (1985) SC 48 (paragraph 10).

13 SC Appeal 123 / 2012

technical error committed by the investigating officer not going to the root of the matter

would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. … “

It was further observed by Hon. Justice Desai in the above case that even honest and

truthful witnesses may defer in some details unrelated to the main incident because

power of observation, retention and reproduction defer with individuals.

As has already been mentioned above, in order to prevent jeopardizing further

proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court, I am compelled to stop here with the process of

reasoning.

I proceed to answer the aforementioned question of law in the negative.

For the above reasons, the Appellant is not entitled to succeed in this appeal. Therefore,

I affirm the judgment of the High Court dated 04-04-2008 and dismiss this appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.
