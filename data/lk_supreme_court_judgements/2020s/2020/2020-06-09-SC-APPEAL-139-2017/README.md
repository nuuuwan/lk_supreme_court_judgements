S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Employer, Next Manufacturing (Pvt) Ltd. is the Employer - Respondent –

Appellant – Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Employer –

Appellant). The Employee, Ms. W.K.S. Jayasundara is the Applicant – Respondent –

Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Employee – Respondent).

It was revealed at the Labour Tribunal that the Employee – Respondent was a

Senior Clerk in the Human Resources division of the said Company and was

employed with the Employer- Appellant from 13.12.1993. Employee – Respondent

claimed that her services were terminated along with other employees after paying

of nominal compensation and obtaining signatures to the documents hence the said

termination of services is unjust and inequitable. The Employee – Respondent filed

an application in the Labour Tribunal and stated inter alia as follows.

(a) That Employee – Respondent joined the company on 13.12.1993 and

was the Senior Clerk- Human Resources on or around 15.05.2009;

(b) That on or around 15.05.2009, 20-25 employees including her had been

terminated from their employment in unjust and inequitable manner by

getting them signed to a document and giving them a nominal

compensation and obtaining signatures to documents;

SC Appeal 139/2017 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 11

Employer – Appellant filed their answer and stated that the services of

Employee- Respondent had ended in consequence of a Voluntary Retirement

Scheme which was formulated in a manner consistent with the provisions of the

Gazette Extraordinary No. 1384/07 dated 15.03.2005 under the Termination of

Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act 45 of 1971.

The Employer- Appellant is a business establishment engaged in

manufacturing of Apparel for export. Necessarily, the success of the business is

contingent upon market forces, to be precise the ‘demand’ for apparel in the

overseas markets. The learned counsel for the Employer- Appellant in the course of

her submissions contended that it is the global economic recession in the apparel

industry, which necessitated such reduction of staff.

The Employer- Appellant raised a preliminary objection at the Inquiry in the

Labour Tribunal that when section 12(1) settlement entered between the Employer-

Appellant and Employee- Respondent under the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), this

application cannot be maintained before the Labour Tribunal. The Employer-

Appellant led the evidence of Mr. Somasiri Perera and the retired Assistant

Commissioner of Labour who had who had entered the Section 12(1) settlement. The

retired Assistant Commissioner of Labour gave evidence and produced the following

documents.

a) Application made by the Employer – Petitioner to the Assistant

Commissioner of Labour for retrenchment of employees (marked ‘R1’);

b) Section 12(1) order which is signed by the Employee – Respondent

(marked ‘R2’);

c) The minutes of the meeting at which the said section 12(1) order was

signed (marked ‘R3’);

d) The calculation of compensation (marked ‘R4’).

The retired Assistant Commissioner of Labour in his evidence stated that, both

the emloyer and employees discussed and negotiated the terms of the settlement

SC Appeal 139/2017 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 11

prior to signing the settlement. Further, he confirmed that, the employees were well

advised on the terms of settlement and were specifically and repeatedly advised that

they do not have to sign the agreement, if they are not agreeable to the same. The

General Manager Sumudu Kannangara confirmed in his evidence that the Section

12(1) settlement was entered into in the presence of both the Assistant

Commissioner of Labour and the official from the Board of Investment (BOI) and the

employees had the opportunity, if they so wished to withdraw from the settlement.

Further, all payments to employees were duly made and only the Employee –

Respondent had maintained this present Labour Tribunal action. The minutes of the

meeting at which the settlement was signed (marked as ‘R3’) revealed that 21

employees had attended the meeting whilst the document ‘R2’ reveals that two

employees namely, W.K.R. Jayasooriya and K.A.P Fernando who attended the

meeting had not signed the settlement. This reveals that the employees had the

freedom to refrain from entering into the settlement if they so wished. However, the

Employee – Respondent had signed the settlement. Counsel for the Employee –

Respondent vehemently denied the said position of the Employer- Appellant.

At the conclusion of the Labour Tribunal Inquiry, the learned President made

the order dated 30.08.2011 and held that, the Employer- Appellant had not followed

the due procedure in terminating the services of the Employee – Respondent and

that Section 12(1) settlement has been entered upon against the will of the Employee

– Respondent therefore the termination of her services is unjust and inequitable

hence awarded a sum of Rs. 297,000/- as compensation.

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned President of Labour Tribunal the

Employer- Appellant appealed to the Provincial High Court. By order dated

22.11.2016 the Provincial High Court affirmed the order of the Labour Tribunal and

dismissed the appeal.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Provincial High Court the Employer-

Appellant preferred an appeal to this court.

SC Appeal 139/2017 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 11

Court being satisfied, granted leave under paragraph 21 (a) and 21 (b) of the

petition dated 20.12.2016 the same as reproduce below for the purpose of easy

reference;.

(a) Whether the Labour Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to disturb a

settlement made under section 12(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act

which amounts to a full and final settlement in law?

(b) Whether the Provincial High Court and Labour Tribunal erred in

law in the in the analysis of the evidence and reached findings

which are perverse?

The Employer- Appellant submits to Court that, said agreement was reached

under Section 12(1) (to be read with section 14) of the (IDA). Further submits that, if

there is any dispute out of a settlement received under Section 12(1) of the IDA

provides remedy under Section 15 of the said Act.

The major question of law raised by the Counsel for the Employer- Appellant

is when the Commissioner of Labour had exercised his jurisdiction under Section

12(1) can the President of the Labour Tribunal have jurisdiction.

As per the submitted facts, due to the world economic recession, the

Employer- Appellant Company namely, Next Manufacturing (Pvt) Ltd which is a BOI

approved company had sought permission from the Commissioner of Labour to

retrench some of their excess staff. The Commissioner of Labour in the presence of

Board of Investment had officiated negotiation between the Employer and

Employees including Employee – Respondent (refer ‘R3 and R2’) out of 21 employees

19 had opted to sign and obtained the compensation.

After obtaining the compensation on 15.05.2009 the Employee – Respondent

complained to the President of Labour Tribunal on 20.08.2009 that she had been

forced to sign a document which she could not read and understand. When the

matter was taken up Employer- Appellant raised a preliminary objection about the

SC Appeal 139/2017 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 11

jurisdiction (at page 118-121 of the brief) but Labour Tribunal decided to take up the

matter for inquiry. Inquiry commenced and evidence led including Assistant

Commissioner of Labour. Both parties made submissions, produced documents as

evidence before the President of Labour Tribunal.

The main submission by the Employee- Respondent before the Labour

Tribunal was that she was forced to sign an unread document. The placing of

signature had occurred in front of the Commissioner of Labour and representatives

of the Board of Investment. When the Assistant Commissioner of Labour gave

evidence this was never questioned nor suggested to him.

Counsel for the Employer- Appellant made submissions before this Court and

confined a question of law that Section 12 (1) gives jurisdiction to the Commissioner

of Labour which is a parallel jurisdiction to the Labour Tribunal. Therefore, the

President of Labour Tribunal cannot hear and determine this issue. Further submits

the affirmation of the order of the Learned President of Labour Tribunal by affirming

the High Court is bad in law.

Conciliation process is dealt in Section 12(1) of the IDA. When the employer

and employee enters into settlement on any industrial dispute with the assistance of

the Commissioner of Labour or any officer acting on his behalf, the Commissioner of

Labour is empowered to draw up a memorandum setting out the terms of settlement

and the said settlement shall be signed by both parties.

In section 12(1) and 12(2) of the IDA the said settlement was described as

follows.

12. (1) If the Commissioner or an authorized officer succeeds in settling

an industrial dispute, a memorandum setting out the terms of

settlement shall be drawn up by the Commissioner or the officer

and shall be signed by both the parties to the dispute or by the

representatives of each party thereto.

SC Appeal 139/2017 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 11

(2) Reference shall be made in every memorandum of settlement drawn

up under subsection (1) to the parties and trade unions to which,

and employers and workmen to whom, such memorandum relates.

In terms of section 14 of the IDA reads as,

14. Every settlement which is for the time being in force shall, for the

purpose of this Act, be binding on the parties, trade unions,

employers and workmen referred to in that settlement in

accordance with the provisions of section 12(2) and the terms of

the settlement shall be implied terms in the contract of

employment between the employers and workmen bound by the

settlement.

The remedy to set aside a section 12(1) settlement is dealt with section 15 of the

IDA where there is a provision to make an application to withdraw from such a

settlement.

15. (1) Any party, trade union, employer or workman, bound by a

settlement under this Act, may repudiate the settlement by written

notice in the prescribed form sent to the Commissioner and to

every other party, trade union, employer and workman bound by

the settlement:

Provided that : -

(a) it shall not be necessary for any employer or any workman who is a

member of a trade union which is, or is included in, a party bound

SC Appeal 139/2017 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 11

by the settlement to be so notified independently of his trade union;

and

(b) any employer or workman, who is a member of a trade union which is,

or is included in, a party bound by the settlement, shall not be

entitled to repudiate the settlement independently of such Trade

Union, and any notice of repudiation given independently by any

such employer or workman shall not be a valid notice for the

purposes of this Act.

Section 12 to 15 of the IDA lay down the procedure to be followed where a

settlement has been concluded or in cases where the parties (or either of them) do

not accept the settlement arrived at. In cases where the settlement arrived at is

acceptable to both parties, a Memorandum setting out the terms of settlement is

drawn up and signed by both parties or their representatives, and such

Memorandum is transmitted with the least amount of delay to the Commissioner of

Labour. Where the Commissioner is of the view that such settlement relates to a

major issue, he is obligatory by Section 12 (6) of the IDA to cause such Memorandum

of Settlement to be published in the Government Gazette, and notice of such

publication is sent to both parties.

The Memorandum of Settlement so published comes into effect on the date

of such publication, or on a date which may be specified in the Memorandum of

Settlement. It is important to note that the legal effect of this procedure is that the

settlement is binding on both parties, and any decisions recorded in the

Memorandum of Settlement becomes part of the Contract of Employment between

the parties bound by the settlement.

In Law of Dismissal by S.R. De Silva at page 3 stated that,

SC Appeal 139/2017 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 11

“Every settlement which is a memorandum within the meaning of

Section 12 of the Industrial Disputes Act and which is for the time being in

force is binding on the parties, trade unions, employers and workmen

referred to in the settlement and its terms become implied terms in the

contracts of employment between the employers and workmen bound by

the settlement. Such a settlement has the same effect as a Collective

Agreement or an award of an Arbitrator or Industrial Court, in relation to

those bound by the settlement. “

Where the settlement recommended by the Memorandum is not accepted by

the parties or one of them, but where the Commissioner is of the opinion that such

Memorandum should be published, it will be published in the Sri Lanka Government

Gazette with a statement that the settlement recommended has not been accepted

nor deemed to have been accepted by either party or both.

Section 15 of the IDA lays down the procedure for repudiation of a settlement.

Section 15 (1) specifically states that where repudiation or termination of a

Memorandum of Settlement is envisaged, such party repudiating the settlement

must send notice of repudiation in the prescribed form to the Commissioner of

Labour and every other party bound by the settlement, though not individually.

Regulation No. 3 made under the IDA published in the Government Gazette of 12

March 1959 in this respect states that such notice of repudiation must be on Form A

set out in the First Schedule to the Regulations. Thus it will be seen that any

settlement to be repudiated by either party must follow the prescribed procedure.

Once the Commissioner of Labour receives a notice of repudiation, he will

cause such notice to be published in the Government Gazette, and the settlement

will cease to be effective from the end of the month immediately proceeding the

month in which the notice is received. It must also be understood that the

repudiation or termination of such a settlement will apply only to those parties who

SC Appeal 139/2017 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 11

give such notice of repudiation or termination and not to others who have been

parties to the settlement.

In my view the process of conciliation in the settlement of labour disputes of

the greatest importance, specially in present context, when the process of mediation

is being resorted to solving larger problems, both legal and otherwise.

Considering all I find that, when the matter is settled under section 12(1) of

the IDA as discussed above, the Labour Tribunal has no jurisdiction. I answered the

question of law raised affirmatively. Accordingly I set aside the order of the Learned

President of the Labour Tribunal and Learned Judges of the High Court and allow this

appeal.

Appeal allowed.
