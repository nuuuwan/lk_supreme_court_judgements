Judgement

Aluwihare PC J.

1. The Accused-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Accused) along with another, were indicted in the High Court for

importation, trafficking and possession of 1384 grams of Heroin, in terms of

Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended

by Act No 13 of 1984 (hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance).

2. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned Judge of the High Court convicted the

Accused-Appellant and acquitted the other who was indicted along with him.

3. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment the Accused appealed to the Court of Appeal

and by its judgment dated 13th March 2015, the Court of Appeal having affirmed

the conviction and the sentence imposed on the Accused, dismissed the Appeal.

4. When this matter was supported before this court, the court granted Special Leave

to Appeal on the following questions of law.

Did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal;

i. Misdirect themselves on the law pertaining to the burden of proof by

holding that the Prosecution need not establish the mental element of

conscious possession in a charge of possession, trafficking or importation

of Heroin in terms of Section 54 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1984.

ii. Err in law, in considering the provisions of Section 69 and 70 of the

Penal Code and thereby casting a burden on the defense, without

4

considering the case for the Prosecution for the purpose of concluding

that the Prosecution had discharged its burden of establishing the

ingredients of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.

iii. Whether mere possession was sufficient to convict the Accused-

Appellant on charges of trafficking in terms of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

iv. A person who brings narcotic substance into the country through the Airport- does it fall under trafficking.

5. It is to be noted that the first two questions referred to above are questions raised

in subparagraph (i) and (iv) of paragraph 8 of the petition of the Accused whilst

the 3rd question was permitted to be raised by this Court when the application for

Special Leave to Appeal was supported on 25th June 2015.

6. The 4th question of law referred to above, was raised on behalf of the State which

was permitted by the Court.

7. Of the four questions referred to above, as far as the 4th question is concerned, I

do not see a question of law embodied therein for the reason that, whether a

person carrying drugs on his body passing through the Airport amounts to

trafficking or not depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. A person

who is addicted to drugs may carry any prohibited substance on his person for his

own consumption. In the circumstances I will not embark on an exercise to

answer the 4th question as there is no ‘question of law’ embodied therein.

Furthermore, Section 54A of the Act defines the meaning of the word “traffic” and

as such whether a person has ‘trafficked’ any of the drugs referred to in the said

provision has to be decided by considering whether the act contemplated, falls

5

within the said definition and not on ‘whether a man carrying drugs has passed

through the airport’.

The Facts

8. The Accused boarded the Sri Lankan Airlines flight UL124 from Madras, which

was bound for Sri Lanka and arrived at the Katunayake International Airport late

in the evening, on 01st September 2001. Witness Upul Gonawela, Assistant

Superintendent of Customs, had been on duty at the ‘Green Channel’ of the

Customs exit point. He had randomly checked several passengers who were

heading towards the exit through the ‘Green Channel’ and one of the passengers

happened to be the Accused. According to witness Gonawela, the Accused had

had four bags as his baggage; two large bags, a blue travelling bag and a

briefcase. Witness had inspected those bags and had found two cello- taped

parcels wrapped in brown paper in the travelling bag that the Accused carried.

Upon inspection, witness had noticed that the parcels contained a brown

coloured powder which was later established to be Heroin. The Government

Analyst had identified 1.384 kilograms of pure Heroin in the two parcels, which

had had a gross weight of 2.384 kilograms.

9. These facts and the detection were not disputed by the Accused at the trial or

before the Court of Appeal.

Matters That are Not in Dispute

10. The Accused admitted that he went to India on 30th August 2001, met a doctor

in relation to his father’s illness on 31st August and enplaned on that same day,

departing from Chennai on the flight UL124.

11. He has also admitted that baggage was checked by the Customs officers and two

brown coloured parcels were removed from the side pockets of the travelling

bag. Thereafter his statement had been recorded and on the following day he

6

had been handed over to the officials of the Prevention of Narcotics Bureau of

the Police.

12. Thus, the Accused had not disputed the detection of drugs and as far as the

detection is concerned, the evidence placed by the Prosecution, to a large extent,

is consistent with the version of the Accused.

The Defense Version

13. The Accused elected to testify under oath before the High Court. His version,

albeit briefly, is as follows; The Accused had said that he went to India to consult

a medical doctor to obtain an opinion on behalf of his father. He had departed

on 30th August and on the following day, that is, the 31st of August, he had left

India bound for Sri Lanka in the flight referred to. At the Chennai Air Port he

had met a couple, whom he had later come to know as Mohammed Faumi and

Chandrani, near the check-in counter of the airline. The couple had approached

him and had offered to pay 2000 Indian Rupees if he agreed to carry part of

their baggage, to which the Accused had consented. He said, in his evidence,

that he was carrying only a briefcase in which he had packed his clothes for

the short trip. Accordingly, two strapped bundles, wrapped in material that is

used to pack fertilizer and another travelling bag that was given by the couple,

had been checked-in as unaccompanied luggage under the Accused’s ticket. The

Accused says he agreed to do so as Faumi claimed that they had exceeded the

weight permitted by the airline. As to the colour of the travelling bag, there

appears to be a discrepancy; the Accused in his evidence at page 639 of the brief

had said that the bag was black in colour, but at page 649 he had referred to it

as a ‘blue bag’. This discrepancy, however, is not material to decide the issues in

this case.

14. Upon arrival at Katunayake, he had collected the two bundles referred to and

placed them on a baggage trolley. When he was about to retrieve the travelling

bag from the baggage carousel, a gentleman sporting a tie had approached him

7

and had directed him to have his baggage checked before leaving. The Accused

identified this Officer as Sivakumar, who testified on behalf of the Prosecution.

It was thereafter that his baggage was checked by witness Gonawela and the

detection was made. The Accused had taken up the position that he had had no

knowledge that the travelling bag he brought to Sri Lanka on behalf of Faumi,

contained narcotics.

15. If I may reiterate, the position taken up by the Accused is that he had no

knowledge that he was taking a bag containing Heroin. Simply his position was

that he is entitled to an acquittal, as the ‘knowledge’ of possessing heroin, which

he claimed he lacked, is an element of the offence for which he was indicted.

The Questions of Law

16. In relation to the first question of law on which Special Leave to appeal was

granted, it was the contention of the learned President’s Counsel that the Court

of Appeal misdirected itself on the law pertaining to the burden of proof, by

holding that the Prosecution need not establish the mental element of ‘conscious

possession’ in a charge of possession, trafficking or importation of Heroin in

terms of Section 54A of the Ordinance. It was further argued on behalf of the

Accused-Appellant that the Court of Appeal erred in law and proceeded on the

misconception that the offence referred to is a ‘strict liability offence’.

17. The thrust of the argument on behalf of the Accused-Appellant was that the

Court of Appeal, having accepted the version of the Accused-Appellant that the

bag containing the parcels of Heroin was given to him by another person,

proceeded to impose liability on the basis that the Accused-Appellant had not

acted with due care in accepting the bag given the attendant circumstances

and thereby their Lordships of the Court of Appeal failed to appreciate that the

burden of proof is on the Prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt that

the Accused-Appellant had the requisite knowledge as far the offence is

8

concerned. The Learned Additional Solicitor General drew the attention of court

to section 394 of the Penal Code, the offence of retention of stolen property. The

learned ASG argued that the said provision criminalises retention [possession]

of stolen property. However, the provision has explicitly laid down the requisite

mens rea [knowledge] but not so under Section 54A of the Ordinance. Based on

this distinction, it was argued on behalf of the State that the onus is on the

Accused to seek refuge under Section 72 of the Penal code once the possession

is established by the Prosecution.

Requirement of ‘Conscious Possession’ in a Charge under Section 54A of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance

18. At the outset, it must be said that the relevant provision of the Ordinance that

establishes the offences referred to, is silent as to the requisite ‘mens rea’. In the

case of Van der Hultes v. Attorney General 1989 1 SLR 204 [supra] where Van

der Hultes was indicted on identical counts as in this case, the Court of Appeal

observed; “We are of the view that mens rea is an essential ingredient of the

offences with which the appellant was charged. The ordinance nowhere rules

out the necessity, recognized in the general law, that the prosecution must prove

this element beyond a reasonable doubt.” [page 215]. Our courts have

continuously held that the mental element is an essential ingredient of the

offence under Section 54A of the Ordinance.

19. I wish to refer to the observation made by Lord Reid in the case of Warner v.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner 1968 52 Crim. Appl. R 373. His Lordship

stated that “It is of utmost importance for the protection of the liberty of the

subject that a court should always bear in mind that, unless a statute either

clearly or by necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a

crime, the court should not find a man guilty of an offence against the criminal

law unless he has a guilty mind”. [page 383]

9

20. The vexed issue that needs consideration is, what is the mens rea contemplated

in Section 54A of the Ordinance. In the case of Warner v. Metropolitan Police

Commissioner [supra] where the Accused was charged for possessing

amphetamine sulfate tablets, a prohibited substance under the Drugs

(Prevention of Misuse) Act of 1964, the House of Lords considered the requisite

mental element of the offence. The question that was certified as fit for the

decision of the House of Lords was, ‘whether a defendant is deemed to be in

possession of a prohibited substance when, to his knowledge, he is physically in

possession of the substance, but is unaware of the true nature’. As it appears the

question referred to is slightly different to the issue in the present case, where

the Accused had taken up the position that he was unaware not only of the true

nature but he was also unaware of the contents he had [physically] in possession

as far as the baggage given to him by Faumi was concerned.

21. In relation to the mental element of ‘knowledge’, however, the pronouncement

of Warner [supra], in my view, has a significant bearing on the case before us

for the reason that Lord Wilberforce has considered the mental element from

the context of the requisite mens rea that requires to be established in a case of

this nature. His Lordship, in reference to the issue of mental element stated; “I

take this as raising the general question as to the nature and extent of knowledge

or awareness, which must be shown against an accused person found in actual

control of a prohibited substance, in order that the section may apply”, [page

452] the very question that this court is called upon to answer.

22. Lord Wilberforce, stating that what must be answered is whether in the

circumstances the Accused should be held to have possession of the substance

rather than mere control, referred to R.S. Wright [Pollock and Wright] “An Essay

on Possession in Common Law” [1888 Part III Chapter 1 page 119] where the

writer had said “The ‘modes or events’ by which the custody commences and

the legal incident in which it is held. By these I mean, relating them to typical

situations, that they [the jury] must consider the manner and circumstances in

10

which the substance or something which contains it, has been received, what

knowledge or means of knowledge or guilty knowledge as to the presence of the

substance, or as to the nature of what has been received, the accused had at the

time of receipt or thereafter up to the moment when he is found with it; his

legal relation to the substance or package (including his right of access to it) On

such matters as these (not exhaustively stated) they [the jury] must make the

decision whether, in addition to physical control, he has, or ought to have

imputed to him the intention to possess or knowledge that he does possess what

is in fact a prohibited substance. If he has this intention or knowledge, it is not

additionally necessary that he should know the nature of the substance.”

23. Lord Wilberforce went on to state that, on such matters as above, though not

exhaustively stated, it must be decided whether in addition to physical control,

he has or ought to have imputed to him, the intention to possess or knowledge

that he does possess, what is in fact a prohibited substance.

24. The above reasoning in my view is a rational guideline that should be adopted

in deciding as to whether the Accused had the knowledge (the requisite mens

rea) that what he possessed is a prohibited substance, even though he may not

have known the precise nature of the substance.

25. I shall now consider the argument placed before this court by the learned

President’s Counsel in relation to the 1st question of law, in the backdrop of the

legal position postulated above.

26. The Court of Appeal had relied on the decision of Jayaseelan Sathyanathan v.

Attorney General CA 188/96 [CA minutes 20- 08-1998]. Even in the said case,

Justice Jayasuriya acknowledged the fact that “knowledge and mens rea is

relevant to liability” and therefore the Accused person is entitled to be acquitted

if he brings his case within the ambit of Sections 69 and 72 of the Penal Code.

Justice Jayasuriya in a subsequent case, Sarala Natarajan Setti v. Attorney

11

General CA 209/96 [CA minutes 29-06-1999] succinctly dealt with the

requisite mental element in a case under Section 54A of the Ordinance. [Both

cases, Jayaseelan and Natarajan Setti relate to charges under Section 54A of the

Ordinance.]

27. In reference to the mental element, Justice Jayasuriya states “…..the prosecution

could discharge the burden in regard to mens rea by relying on a presumption

arising under special circumstances of the case established by it in which case

there is no burden to establish knowledge, affirmatively, but by relying on a

presumption, prosecution shifts the evidential burden of proof and the accused

required to rely on the provisions of sections 69 and 72 of the Penal Code to

negate the knowledge”. [page 3 of the judgement]

28. This observation, in my view is consonant with the view expressed by Lord

Wilberforce in the case of Warner [supra] when his Lordship [Wilberforce]

stated; “By there, I mean, relating these to the circumstances in which the

substance or something which contained it, had been received” [by the Accused]

(the emphasis is mine). As such, consideration must be given as to whether the

Prosecution has discharged its burden in regard to establishing mens rea

presumptively, arising under the circumstances peculiar to the instant case, and

if that was so, whether the Accused had discharged the evidentiary burden to

negate the same. It must be stated that the evidentiary burden on the Accused is

to create a reasonable doubt as to the requisite knowledge. See Sumanawathie

Perera v. Attorney General 1998 2 SLR 20.

29. The learned ASG also drew the attention of the court to the decision in the case

of Shanmugarajah v. The Republic 1990 2 SLR 57 where the court held, “..in a

clear case it would be open to the prosecution to make out a prima facie case as

to the mental element required by invoking the tentative presumption that a

person is deemed to intend the natural consequences of his act”. The learned

ASG argued that, in the present case the prosecution did establish a strong prima

12

facie case and if an accused in such situation did nothing, the prosecution may

be held to have discharged its burden in regard to proof of the mental element

necessary to establish liability. The learned ASG pointed out, that the learned

trial judge having carefully evaluated the evidence given by the accused had

rejected the accused’s version giving reasons for doing so. Thus, the learned ASG

argued that the only acceptable evidence that was available to the court was the

version of the Prosecution.

30. In the instant case, the Accused had elected to give evidence under oath and

stated that he carried his father’s medical records, even on his return trip, but

none of them were produced to substantiate his assertion which he could have

done. His explanation was that his briefcase was taken into custody and when

it was returned, the documents were not there. However, he had failed to

confront any of the witnesses who testified on behalf of the Prosecution in this

regard. Further, his assertion that he volunteered to check in luggage belonging

to total strangers who turned up at the airport, under his ticket for a meagre

payment is also highly improbable for several reasons. He did not know how

genuine the strangers were and more importantly, he did not have any idea as

to the contents that were to be checked in as luggage, under his ticket. It would

not be unreasonable to presume that it was well within his knowledge that

people do smuggle contraband into the country under various guises, given the

social standing of the Accused. In the case of Warner [supra] Lord Reid observed;

“ Further, it would be pedantic to hold that it must be shown that the accused

knew precisely which drug he had in possession…..and in fact virtually

everyone knows that there are prohibited drugs. So it would be quite sufficient

to prove facts from which it could properly be inferred that the accused knew

that he had a prohibited drug in his possession.”

31. Even if the Accused is given the full benefit of playing the role of a good

Samaritan, in assisting the passengers who claimed they were overweight, there

was no reason for the Accused to have the luggage collected upon arrival at

13

Katunayake airport for the simple reason that the ‘weight issue’ is of no

relevance once the baggage arrives. The Accused had not given any explanation

for his conduct in this regard. The Learned ASG drew the attention of this court

to the testimony of the Accused where he had said that he helped Chandrani

[who was with Faumi and came in the same flight] to place the bag she brought

on the trolley. The learned ASG argued that this is not a probable conduct of a

normal person. In the circumstances I hold that both the learned High Court

Judge as well as the Court of Appeal was correct in holding that, inferentially

the Prosecution had established that the Accused had the requisite knowledge,

thus, I answer the 1st question of law on which Special Leave was granted in the

negative.

32. The second question of law on which Special Leave was granted was, as to

whether the Court of Appeal, in considering Sections 69 and 72 of the Penal

Code, erred in casting a burden on the defence, without first considering as to

whether the Prosecution had discharged its burden of establishing the

ingredients of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.

33. As stated earlier, as the law stands now, the Prosecution can discharge its

burden of establishing the requisite mental element presumptively, by adducing

circumstances in which the [prohibited] substance or something which

contained it had been recovered [from the Accused]. The learned trial judge

having analysed the position taken up by the Accused at the trial (pages 15 to

24 of the judgement) had arrived at a clear finding of fact that the position taken

up by the Accused cannot be accepted and has proceeded to reject the same.

The learned trial judge had also come to a finding of fact that the Accused had

brought into this country from Chennai the bag containing Heroin, which was

in the control and possession of the Accused, knowing very well that the bag

contained the substance;

14

34. Thus, it appears that the trial judge had not cast any burden on the Accused to

prove anything but had arrived at his findings purely on an analysis of the

evidence led before the court. At the arguments before this court, the learned

President’s Counsel did not advert to any misdirection on the part of the trial

judge as far as application of Sections 69 and 72 of the Penal Code are

concerned. It is noteworthy to mention that even in the written submissions filed

on behalf of the Accused before the High Court, it had not been urged that the

Accused was entitled to the benefit of the said provisions of the Penal Code.

35. The principle contention on behalf of the Accused before the Court of Appeal

had been, as to whether the Prosecution had established the requisite knowledge

on the part of the Accused in order to convict him for the offences with which

he was indicted. The Court of Appeal, in reference to the case of Jayaseelan v.

Attorney General [supra] had made a passing reference to Sections 69 and 72

of the Penal Code presumably because those sections were considered in

Jayaseelan’s case [supra]. The court proceeded to hold that both, Sections 69 and

72 postulate that the Accused should have acted in good faith and had given

consideration to the manner in which the Accused had conducted himself under

the circumstances and had held that the Accused “cannot be heard to say that

he acted with due care and attention in the attendant circumstances.”

15

36. I am of the view that Section 69 of the Penal Code has no application to the

instant case as the section is applicable to an ‘act’ done in the belief that he is

‘bound by law’ to do it.

37. Section 72 of the Penal Code is found in verbatim in the Indian Penal Code and

the corresponding provision is Section 79. The enactment of the Indian Penal

Code is anterior to ours and as such it could be said that section 72 of our Penal

Code is a reproduction of section 79 of the Indian Penal Code, given the fact that

both Codes were drafted by the one individual. And as such its scope and

application necessarily has to be the same, both here and in India.

38. Gour [Penal Law of India, 11th Edition page 571] states that the section embodies

one of the general exceptions in the Code and the onus of showing that the

section applies in his case is on the person who seeks to take advantage of it.

[Also see Nirmakumar Bhowmik v. Emperor AIR 1938 Cal. page 553]. Gour

goes on to say that Section 79 requires that the party pleading this exception

should have acted in good faith and the definition of good faith involves due

care and attention, both of which were lacking, on the part of the Accused in

this case.

39. In fairness to their Lordships of the Court of Appeal, as referred to earlier, no

burden has been placed on the Accused by the Court, but the Lordships have

stated the legal position relating to the application of Section 72. The Court of

Appeal has not erred in that regard. As such I answer the 2nd question on which

Special Leave was granted also in the negative.

40. The final question of law that this court is called upon to answer is, as to whether

‘possession’ was sufficient to convict the Accused-appellant on charges of

trafficking in terms of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

41. As far as the mental element is concerned, I am of the view that the offence of

[drug] trafficking is similar to possession, since it requires to be established that

16

the perpetrator knowingly possessed or had control over a dangerous drug.

Thus, one cannot engage in drug trafficking while being unaware that he or

she is in possession of a drug, or if he or she reasonably but mistakenly believes

that the substance is legal. The offence of drug trafficking, however, also

requires that the Prosecution establish that the perpetrator was involved in the

selling, procuring, storing, administering, transporting, delivering or

distributing of such drugs, or had offered to do anything referred to above

[Definition of the term “traffic” in section 54 A of the Ordinance]. It is this

additional requirement [of an act] that transforms the status of the offence [of

possession] to trafficking.

42. Since possession and trafficking can look the same at first glance, Prosecution

for drug trafficking typically requires producing additional circumstantial

evidence to indicate that the Accused was in possession of drugs not for personal

use but for commercial purposes. The quantity of the drug detected would be a

good indicator to decide whether the perpetrator is a user [an addict] or is

trading in drugs. This would be a question of fact. It is in this context, it was

stated at the commencement of this judgement, that the 4th question of law raised

by the State, on which special leave was granted does not contain a question of

law, thus this court will not endeavour to answer that question.

43. For the reasons set out above, I answer the 3rd question of law affirmatively. Even

though I have answered the 3rd question of law referred to above in the

affirmative, I am of the view that the Accused, cannot stand to benefit from it as

for the reasons referred to above inferentially the Prosecution had established

that he had the knowledge, that what he carried from Chennai to Sri Lanka was

a prohibited substance.

44. For the reasons set out above the 1st and 2nd questions of law on which special

leave was granted are answered in the negative while the 3rd question is

answered in the affirmative.

17

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence imposed on the Accused-

Appellant is affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed.
