S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

P.U.P. Kumara De Silva (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Petitioner)

filed this Fundamental Rights application on the 19/09/2012 stating that his

fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 12(1), 12(2), 14(1) (g) and 17 were

violated by non – promotion and/or non – absorption and failure to give permanent

appointment in the Sri Lanka Engineering Service Class II Grade II from the Sri Lanka

Technical Services. Leave to proceed was granted by this Court for the alleged

infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

According to the Petitioner’s petition he joined as a Technical Officer

(Electrical) Grade III of Middle Level Technical Service (MLTS) in the Local

Government Service on the 01/10/1985. On the 07/03/1991 he was absorbed into

the Provincial Public Service and posted to the Balapitiya Pradeshiya Sabha. During

this period the Ceylon Electricity Board was privatized and the services of the

Petitioner were terminated. Being aggrieved by this decision the Petitioner filed

Fundamental Rights Application No. SC FR 144/92. A settlement was reached and

Court directed that the Petitioner be reinstated with due seniority and back wages.

He was then posted to the Municipal Council of Galle. In 1994 the Petitioner was

absorbed into the Sri Lanka Technical Services (SLTS) from the Middle Level Technical

Service in the Local Government. On the 24/08/1995 his services were made

permanent with effect from 03/10/1985. On 12/03/1997 he was promoted as a

Technical Officer (Electrical) Grade II. Thereafter in 1999 he was promoted to Grade II

A. in December 1999 he was absorbed into SLTS Grade I and in 2002 he was

promoted to the special grade.

The Sri Lanka Engineering Service (SLES) was governed by the Gazette

Extraordinary dated 07/06/1988 and is a service distinct from the SLTS. Appointments

to the SLES are vested in the 1st Respondent Public Service Commission. The cadre

structure in the SLES is Class I, Class II Grade I and Class II Grade II (Recruitment

SC FR 551/2012 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 15

grade). An avenue of progress to the SLES for Class I and/or Special Class officers

under the SLTS was created by the Engineering Service Circular No. 31 dated

5/8/1997 by the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs and plantation

industries at the time (P7). Thus it is evident that the only way for an Officer of the

SLTS to be appointed to the SLES is through the aforementioned avenue of progress

as set out in the Circular marked P7.

On the 9th of February 2006, while the Petitioner was performing his duties in

the Southern Provincial Council, he was appointed as an acting engineer to cover up

the position of electrical engineer. Since then he was writing to the authorities to

make him permanent in the said position. The Petitioner claims that, as per Circular

No. 31 dated 5/8/1997, he is entitled to be appointed as an Engineer Class II Grade II

from 4/10/2000. Further he moves that the letter sent by the 20th Respondent dated

20/08/2012 (letter written by the Deputy Chief Secretary [Engineering] [Southern

Province] to the accountant terminating allowances paid for cover up duties to the

Petitioner from 06/08/2012) be quashed.

The 11th and 20th Respondents’ filed objections and took up the following

preliminary objections;

a) The application is time barred.

b) Necessary parties are not before the court.

c) Prayer c of the petition is inaccurate and is contrary to the Supreme Court

rules 44(1) (d)

When this matter was pending before this court both parties informed Court that

they were willing to settle the matter. Finally on the 16th of May 2019 the

Petitioner informed Court that if he is given the benefits attached to the cover –

up duties, he is willing to withdraw the application.

When taking this matter into consideration I find it pertinent to first discuss

the Petitioner’s aforementioned acting appointment (වැඩ බලන) in February of

SC FR 551/2012 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 15

2006 from which the alleged Fundamental Rights infringement stems from. The

Petitioner’s main grievance is that he was not made permanent in the acting

appointment. As evident from the above mentioned facts the Petitioner came to

this Court in 2012, after a period of six years had lapsed since the acting

appointment was made. I am of the view that the Petitioner accepted the acting

appointment without any objection in 2006, as he himself was aware that he was

not qualified to be appointed to the said post on a permanent basis. Even though

the Petitioner may not have been qualified for the post, had he wanted to be

made permanent in that position he could have taken the necessary steps to

become qualified for that post as per Circular No. 31 dated 5/8/1997 (P7). The

procedure set out in P7 is reproduced below for ease of reference.

(3) The minimum qualifications and the conditions for promotion to Class II/II of the Sri

Lanka Engineering Service for Officers of the Sri Lanka Technological Service (former

MLTS) who are attached to Departments and Provincial Councils are as follows;

(i) An officer who has passed the 3rd examination conducted by the commissioner

of examinations, with 15 years of total service, out of which a minimum of 5

years should be in CL 1 of the SLTS and/or CL II “A” of the former MLTS or

(ii) An officer who has passed the Senior Technical Examination conducted by the

commissioner of Examinations, with a total of 15 years of service out of which a

minimum period of 5years should be in CL I of the SLTS and/or CL II “A” of the

former MLTS Or

(iii) An officer in the special grade of the SLTS or CL 1 of the former MLTS with a

total of 21 years of service and passed the 2nd examination for Technical officers

conducted by the Commissioner of Examinations.

(iv) An officer in the special grade of the SLTS or CL1 of the former MLTS with a total

of 21 years of service who has been recruited directly to the territorial Civil

Engineering Organization or absorbed to the TCEO from other Government

Departments as per the TCEO Minute ad successfully completed the2nd

SC FR 551/2012 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 15

common examination for Technical officers conducted by the Commissioner of

examinations before the specified date (i.e. 31sr December 1980)

(v) An officer in the SLTS/MLTS seeking Engineering grade promotion to civil group

3 of the Sri Lanka Engineering Service should have passed in Hydraulics and

Irrigation subjects in any of the qualifying examination mentioned above, which

he has successfully completed to become eligible for promotion to the

Engineering grade in the SLES.

The procedure in which an Officer in the Special Class of the SLTS can be

promoted to the SLES is set out above. On perusing the material available before us

it is evident that the Petitioner had not provided this court with any evidence

pertaining to the fact that he had among the other requirements sat for and passed

the 2nd examination for Technical officers conducted by the Commissioner of

examinations. Hence the Petitioner had no right to ask for his acting appointment to

be made permanent as he had not fulfilled the mandatory requirements that are

provided in the Circular marked P7. Furthermore the allowance, facilities and benefits

provided to the Petitioner in the course of his acting appointment are not a right

they are merely a privilege. And as such the Petitioner cannot make an application to

this court under Fundamental Rights jurisdiction to obtain said benefits by claiming

them to be a right.

I find it pertinent to discuss the time bar per Article 126 (2) of the Constitution as

it relates to this application. Article 126(2) of the Constitution stipulates that an

applicant should invoke the jurisdiction of this court within 30 days from the

violation. Prior Judgments of this court have touched upon this principle.

In the case of Demuni Sriyani De Soyza and others v Dharmasena

Dissanayake, Public Service Commission and others - SC/FR 206/2008 (S.C.M –

9th December 2016) Hon. Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, PC stated as follows;

SC FR 551/2012 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 15

“Article 126(2) of the constitution stipulates that, a person who alleges that

any of his fundamental rights have been infringed or are about to be

infringed by executive or administrative action may…within one month

thereof…apply to this court by way of a petition praying for relief or redress

in respect of such infringement. The consequence of this stipulation in Article

126(2) is that, a Petition which is filed after the expiry of a period of one

month from the time the alleged infringement occurred, will be time barred

and unmaintainable. This rule is so well known that it hardly needs to be

stated here.

The rule that, an application under Article 126 which has not been filed

within one month of the occurrence of the alleged infringement will make

that application unmaintainable, has been enunciated time and again from

the time this Court exercised the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction conferred

upon it by the 1978 Constitution. Thus, in Edirisuriya v Navaratnam

(1985 1 SLR 100 at p.105 – 106), Ranasinghe J, as he then was, stated

“this court has consistently proceeded on the basis that the time limit of one

month set out in Article 126(2) of the Constitution is mandatory”

In the case of Lewla Thiththapajjalage Illangaratne v Kandy Municipal

Council and Others (1995 BALJ Vol. VI Part 1) Kulatunga J held as follows;

“The result of the express stipulation of a one month time limit in Article

126(2) is that, this court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application which

is filed out of time – ie: after the expiry of one month from the occurrence of

the alleged infringement or imminent infringement which is complained

of…if it is clear that an application is out of time, the Court has no

jurisdiction to entertain such application”

I carefully considered the Petitioner’s application, giving special consideration to

paragraph 5 and the prayers in the petition. Prayer C states as follows;

(Emphasis added)

SC FR 551/2012 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 15

“ (c) – Quash the letter dated 20/08/2012 (P11) issued by the 20th Respondent.”

When I perused the document marked P11 it is the Gazette No.1726 dated

30/09/2011. Whereas P12 is the letter dated 20/08/2012 and written by the 20th

Respondent. I presume that the Petitioner in actuality want to quash P12.

Prayers d, e and f in the petition are virtually praying to appoint the Petitioner

to the SLES Class II Grade II from 04/10/2000 with back wages.

Taking into consideration the 1st preliminary objection raised by the

Respondents namely, the time bar, I find that the Petitioner is relying on a Circular

issued by the Secretary of Public Administration and Home Affairs dated 02/01/2009

calling for applications from officers who are in the SLTS to apply for the post of Sri

Lanka Engineering Service Class II Grade II (Marked P9). The Petitioner after having

failed to fulfill the requirements stipulated in “P9” made communications with some

of the Respondents, from the date that he was appointed to cover up duties. There is

no material submitted that he had fulfilled the requirements stipulated in the said

circular marked P9 and the Petitioner had come to Court with unexplained undue

delay seeking relief in 2012 based on the circular (P9) issued in 2009.

Prayer ‘C’ of the petition focuses on the letter dated 20/08/2020. It was by this

letter that the decision to stop the payment of the acting allowance had been

communicated to the Petitioner and the accountant. The Petitioner came to this

Court on the 19/09/2012. Hence, prima facie it satisfies Article 126(2). The Petitioner

claims that discontinuing his allowance paid during the acting appointment (cover up

duties) is a violation of his Fundamental Rights.

According to P12 the date of the letter is 20/08/2012. However in order to

obtain a proper perspective P12 should not be read in isolation, it should be read in

conjunction with letters marked P5D, P5C, P5A and P5E. P12 references P5D (letter

dated 04/04/2006). By P12, the payments authorized by letter P5D had been

stopped. The payments approved of by P5D had been approved of in the year 2006,

SC FR 551/2012 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 15

consequent to a decision in P5C. By P5C the Petitioner had been specifically informed

that the acting appointment would be effective until the vacancy is filled by a

permanent appointee. Furthermore, when the Petitioner accepted the acting

appointment in 2006 by P5E he was aware that the acting appointment was to be

made until the post of Sri Lanka Engineering Service Class II Grade II (Electrical) in the

Southern Provincial Council was filled. Hence I find that the grievance arising from

P12 is linked to the appointment made to fill the vacancy of the said post. Therefore

the date of the alleged infringement of the Petitioner’s rights arising from the letter

dated 20/08/2012 is the date of appointment of the new appointee and the one

month period in relation to Article 126(2) of the Constitution should begin from that

date.

When I perused P13 which is an appointment letter for P.U.P.K De Silva to be

granted an acting appointment in SLES Class II Grade II (Electrical) dated 10/08/2012,

I found that in paragraph No.2, it was revealed that an engineer who belonged to

SLES Class II Grade II (Electrical) had transferred and reported for work on

08/08/2012. Hence the one month period began from the 8th of August 2012. Further

the Petitioner did not reveal this fact to Court in his petition and affidavit and hence

this amounts to a misrepresentation. This application was filed on 19/09/2012 which

was after one month from the date of the alleged violation of his fundamental rights.

If the Petitioner sought the benefit of the principle that the time period in

relation to Article 126(2) should start counting from the date he became aware of the

act resulting in the alleged infringement as recognized by this Court in

Demuni Sriyani De Soyza and others v Dharmasena Dissanayake, Public Service

Commission and others (Supra) it is pertinent to note the following observations of

this court;

“where the time period of one month is to be computed not from the

date of the occurrence of the alleged infringement but from the day the

Petitioner becomes aware of the alleged infringement - in the decision cited

SC FR 551/2012 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 15

by De Alwis J, namely, SIRIWARDENE vs. RODRIGO, Ranasinghe J, as he

then was, held [at p.387] “Where however, a petitioner establishes that he

became aware of such infringement, or the imminent infringement, not on

the very day the act complained of was so committed, but only subsequently

on a later date, then, in such a case, the said period of one month will be

computed only from the date on which such petitioner did in fact become

aware of such infringement and was in a position to take effective steps to

come before this Court.”. This principle has been reiterated time and again.

It should be added here that, if the facts and circumstances of an

application make it clear that, a Petitioner, by the standards of a reasonable

man, should have become aware of the alleged infringement by a particular

date, the time limit of one month will commence from that date on which he

should have become aware of the alleged infringement.”

The case of Sri Lanka Nidahas Rubber Inspectors Union v R. B. Premadasa-

SC/FR 109/2005 (S.C.M – 25th September 2019) further reiterates the

aforementioned principle. the burden is on the Petitioner to establish the date on

which he became aware of the relevant act.

In Lewla Thiththapajjalage Illangaratne v Kandy Municipal Council and

Others (Supra) Kulatunga J stated as follows;

“Hence it would not suffice for the petitioner to merely assert that he

personally had no knowledge of the discriminatory act, if on an

objective assessment of the evidence, If the law were otherwise, and the

Court is constrained to entertain applications which are out of time upon

subjective considerations, the mandatory time limit would be rendered

nugatory. It would also lead to the mischief that the petitioner will be given

SC FR 551/2012 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 15

a measure of discretion to select the time of coming before this Court,

according to his convenience.”

Thus it is apparent that a heavy burden lies on the Petitioner to establish this fact and

a mere assertion does not suffice.

The Petitioner’s silence on this fact fails to establish that he did not become

aware of the new appointment on the 08/08/2012 even though the letter dated

10/08/2012 (P13) clearly establishes the fact that the new appointee had reported for

duty on 08/08/2012. Thus it is reasonable to assume that a person would become

aware of an appointment of a person who takes over the duties he had been

performing at least on the day the new appointee reports for duty. Therefore I find

that the Petitioner has failed to satisfy Article 126(2) even in relation to prayer C of

the petition.

As discussed above, it is apparent that the Petitioner is seeking remedy under

the circular dated 02/01/2009 (marked P9) in relation to prayers (d), (e), (f) but he

filed this application on the 19th of September 2012. Hence, I find this claim to be

time barred.

For the purpose of completeness, as it was discussed above in the Circular

marked P7, the Petitioner was not automatically qualified to be appointed to the

SLES Class II Grade II. There is no evidence before this Court that the Petitioner had

fulfilled the requirements stipulated in P7

Further it is revealed that the newly appointed Electrical Engineer from the

SLES had assumed duty which was covered up by the Petitioner on the 08/08/2012

but the Petitioner had come to courts on 19/09/2012. Consequently, I find this claim

to also be time barred. Accordingly I find the Petitioner’s application to be

unmaintainable before this court under Article 126 of the Constitution. This results in

the dismissal of this application.

(Emphasis added)

SC FR 551/2012 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 15

Since the preliminary objection on time bar is upheld this court has no

jurisdiction to hear the other issues raised by the Petitioner. Application Dismissed.

We order no costs.

Application dismissed.
