Sisira J. de Abrew, J The learned District Judge by his judgment dated 13.12.2007 held the case in

favour of the Plaintiff. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned

District Judge, the Defendant appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of

Mount Lavinia and the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court by

their judgment dated 2.10.2013 dismissed the appeal. Being aggrieved by the

said judgment of the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court, the

Defendant appealed to this court and this court by its order dated 1.10.2014

granted leave to appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs 10(a) to (c)

of the petition of Appeal dated 11.11.2013 which are set out below.

1. Whether the learned District Judge and the Honourable High Court

Judges have erred in law holding that there was a Constructive Trust

established in favour of the Respondents despite the fact that the

Respondents had no locus standi/legal standing to file an action as

constituted in their plaint.

2. Whether the learned District Judge and the Honourable High Court

Judges have erred in law holding in favour of the Respondents despite

the fact that the alleged cause of action to obtain a decree of a

Constructive Trust does not fall to any category of Constructive Trust

contemplated in Chapter IX of the Trust Ordinance.

3. Whether the learned District Judge and the Honourable High Court

Judges have failed to evaluate the evidence adduced at the trial in

coming to the said conclusion as the evidence revealed that in fact late

K.A. Upasena had no intention whatsoever either to retain the

beneficial interest for himself or to pass on to the Respondents.

Facts of this case may be briefly summarized as follows. The three plaintiffs

and the defendant in this case are sisters and brothers.

Niriellage Upasena who is the father of the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-Respondents) and the Defendant-

Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Appellant)

gifted the property in question by Deed No.529 dated 11.6.2001 to the

Defendant-Appellant. This was an irrevocable gift and the donor Niriellage

Upasena did not keep the life interest of the property. Niriellage Upasena died

in June 2002. After the death of Niriellage Upasena, the Plaintiff-Respondents

filed this case in the District Court of Mount Lavinia against the Defendant-

Appellant seeking, inter alia, a declaration that the Defendant-Appellant holds

the property in question in trust in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondents and to

retransfer share of the property in question to the Plaintiff-Respondents. It

was the contention of the Plaintiff-Respondents that the property in question

was gifted to the Defendant-Appellant for her to get visa to go to Canada and

that their father never intended to transfer the beneficial interest to the

Defendant-Appellant. Therefore, the most important question that must be

decided in this case is whether the Defendant-Appellant held the property in

question in trust in favour of her father. The 1st Plaintiff-Respondent

Niriellage Jayamini Keerthiseeli says in her evidence that the property in

question was gifted to the Defendant-Appellant for her to get visa to go to

Canada. The Notary Public who attested the relevant Deed of Gift (Deed of

Gift No.529) says, in his evidence, that he was informed that there was a

SC Appeal 179/2014

necessity to produce the relevant deed to the relevant Embassy in order to

obtain visa. It is interesting to find out as to who gave this information to the

Notary Public. Mr.Ranawaka the Notary Public says, in his evidence, that it

was the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent who gave this information. Mr.Ranawaka the

Notary Public, in his evidence, further says the following matters.

1. He (the Notary Public) is a neighbour of the donor Niriellage Upasena.

2. The donor Niriellage Upasena told him (the Notary Public) that he

wanted to gift the property in question to her youngest daughter.

3. The donor Niriellage Upasena did not tell the Notary Public that he

wanted to get the property back after gifting the same to her youngest

daughter.

4. He (the Notary Public) prepared the Deed of Gift No.529 on the

instructions given by the donor.

It has to be noted here that the above evidence of the Notary Public was not

challenged in the cross-examination. From the above evidence of the Notary

Public it is clear that the donor Niriellage Upasena had fully gifted the

property in question to the Defendant-Appellant with clear intention of gifting

and that he did not have an intention to reclaim the property in question from

the donee. The above evidence clearly demonstrates that the Defendant-

Appellant was not holding the property in question in trust in favour of the

donor who is her father. If the Defendant-Appellant was not holding the

property in question in trust in favour of the donor who is the father of the

Defendant-Appellant and the Plaintiff-Respondents, then the Defendant-

SC Appeal 179/2014

Appellant was not holding the property in question in trust in favour of the

Plaintiff-Respondents. Further, the Plaintiff-Respondents have failed to

adduce any evidence to show that there were attendant circumstances to

establish any constructive trust between the donor and the Defendant-

Appellant. When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the Plaintiff-

Respondents are not entitled to the relief claimed in the plaint. The learned

District Judge and the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court have

failed to consider the above evidence of the Notary Public and come to the

wrong conclusion that the Defendant-Appellant was holding the property in

question in trust in favour of the donor.

In view of the conclusion reached above, I answer the 3rd question of law in

the affirmative and answer the 1st question of law as follows. The learned

District Judge and the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court have

come to the wrong conclusion that the Defendant-Appellant was holding the

property in question in trust in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondents. The

Defendant-Appellant was not holding the property in question in trust in

favour of the Plaintiff-Respondents.

In view of the answers given to the 1st and the 3rd questions of law, the 2nd

question of law does not arise for consideration.

For the above reasons, I set aside both judgments of the learned District Judge

and the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court and allow the appeal. I

dismiss the action of the Plaintiff-Respondents. The learned District Judge is

Appellant is entitled to the costs in all three courts.
