Introduction

The Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the “Petitioner”) filed an

application by Petition dated 15th December 2014 in the High Court of the Western

Province Sitting in Colombo in the Exercise of Its Civil Jurisdiction (hereinafter referred

to as the “High Court”) against the Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the “Respondent”) for a claim of Oppression and Mismanagement under Section 224,

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 25

225 and 521 of the Companies Act No.07 of 2007(hereinafter referred to as the

“Companies Act”), seeking inter alia the granting of Interim Orders requested as prayed

for in paragraph 32 of the Petition dated 18th December 2015.

Upon the parties making written submissions and subsequent oral submissions,

the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court delivered an Order on 3rd December

2015 refusing to grant the Interim Orders sought by Petitioner based on laches on the

part of the Petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the Petitioner appealed to

the Supreme Court seeking inter-alia the following reliefs;

a) Grant the Petitioner Leave to Appeal against the Order of the Learned Judge

of the High Court of the Western Province Sitting in Colombo in the Exercise

of its Civil Jurisdiction dated 03rd December 2015, marked ‘Y17’;

b) Set aside the Order of the Learned Judge of the High Court of the Western

Province Sitting in Colombo in the Exercise of its Civil Jurisdiction dated 03rd

December 2015, marked ‘Y17’;

c) Issue Interim Orders as prayed for in prayers (j), (k), (l), (m), (n) and (o) of the

Petition dated 15th December 2014 in the said action bearing No. HC (Civil)

59/2014 (Co).

Pursuant thereto, after hearing the Counsel for the parties on 11th March 2016

and 14th March 2016, leave to appeal was granted precisely on the questions of law set

out in paragraphs 38(c), (h) and (j) of the Petition namely;

c) The Learned Judge of the Commercial High Court has misdirected himself by

failing to recognize that a duty to approach Court for relief against the affairs

of a company being conducted in a manner oppressive to a shareholder

and/or mismanagement does not arise until the commission of a series of

acts

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 25

h) The Learned Judge of the Commercial High Court has misdirected himself by

failing to consider the series of acts of oppression and/or mismanagement,

in addition to the removal of said Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe from being a

Director of the 1st Respondent Company, referred to in the Petition and the

entitlement of the Petitioner for the grant of the interim orders prayed for in

the Petition on the basis thereof:

j) The Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself in failing to

appreciate that the fundamental complaint of the Petitioner is that the

affairs of the 1st Respondent Company have been conducted in a manner

oppressive to the Petitioner and/or mismanaged and the interim orders are

required for the protection of the interests of the 1st Respondent Company

and the Petitioner as a minority shareholder thereof

Both parties have filed their written submissions and have advanced their oral

arguments. I find it pertinent to set out the material facts of the case prior to

addressing the questions of law before us.

Background to this application

The now Petitioner and now 2nd Respondent are the two shareholders of the

now 1st Respondent Company and each holds 50% of the issued shares thereof. The

2nd Respondent and now 3rd Respondent are currently Directors of 1st Respondent

Company and the 4th Respondent is the Company Secretary. As the Petitioner is an

artificial person, its interests as a 50% shareholder were represented in the Board of

Directors by Director Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe, who happens to be the Chairman of

the Petitioner Company.

It is the Petitioners allegation that Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe was irregularly

and unlawfully removed from the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent Company

by the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner submits Form 20 dated 31st January 2014,

marked as ‘Y6’, in order to demonstrate that the Registrar-General of Companies was

informed of such removal by the 4th Respondent that the said Dr. Bandusena

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 25

Ranasinghe has resigned from the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent Company

on or around 10th October 2013. This document is signed by the 4th Respondent and

mentions the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to be the remaining Directors of the company

while the 4th Respondent remains as the Company Secretary. Form 20 is submitted as

Section 223(2) of the Companies Act requires such document communicating the

change of Directors.

However, The Respondents have failed to comply with the requirements of Section

223 as the Section states as follows:

(2) The company shall ensure that notice in the prescribed form of—

(a) a change in the directors or the secretary of the company..

is delivered to the Registrar for registration.”

And further that:

“(3) A notice under subsection (2) shall—

(a) specify the date of the change;

(c) be delivered to the Registrar within twenty working days of—

(i) the change occurring, in the case of the appointment or

resignation of a director or secretary;”

Additionally, Form 20 in itself, as evidenced by ‘Y6’, states at the end of the 2nd page

the following:

“Notice should be delivered to the Registrar of Companies, within 20

working days of the change occurring”

‘Y6’ mentions the 10th of October 2013 to be the date Dr. Bandusena

Ranasinghe ceased to hold office. Taking public holidays in the year 2013 into

account, the 20 working days would elapse on or around the 8th of November

2013. Despite this, the document ‘Y6’ was only submitted to the registrar on

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 25

the 31st of January 2014, after well over 3 months of the purported date of

Resignation. If Form 20 were to be an authentic document as the Respondent

insists, the 1st - 4th Respondents would be liable to pay a fine upon conviction

as stated in 223(3) as follows:

(4) Where a company fails to comply with this section—

(a) the company shall be guilty of an offence and be liable on conviction

to a fine not exceeding one hundred thousand rupees; and

(b) every officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an

offence and be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty thousand

rupees.

The above inconsistency by the Respondents’ negligence is rather ironic as it is

the Respondent in this case that wishes to continue to emphasize the importance of

delay and timeliness in following procedure. Further, there is no evidence before this

court to believe that the Registrar of Companies has taken any action regarding the

above violation of Section 223.

Further, it must be noted that despite Article 8 of Articles of Association

requiring an appointment of a director to be made in replacement of Dr. Bandusena

Ranasinghe in order to represent the interests of the Petitioner, the annexed Form 20

in itself does not make any replacement and there have been no further steps taken

by the 2nd,3rd or 4th Respondent to make such replacement. For this reason, there are

no directors representing the interest of the Petitioner in the 1st Respondent company

as at present.

In order to contest Form 20, the Petitioner submits the Annual Return Form of

the 1st Respondent Company filed as at 31st December 2013 (marked as ‘Y3’, signed

by Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe, the 2nd Respondent and 3rd Respondent.) Additionally,

the Petitioner also files a cheque signed by Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe dated 21st

November 2013 marked ‘Y7a’ and the Bank Statement indicating the realization of

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 25

specified cheque, annexed as ‘Y7b’ in order to demonstrate that Dr. Bandusena

Ranasinghe had not resigned as indicated by Form 20. Additionally, the Petitioner

alleged the existence of a fraudulent letter, which was the basis of Form 20 in the

instant case, however it must be noted that the Petitioner has not taken any steps to

produce such a letter.

The Petitioner also submits a letter dated 1st July 2014 annexed as ‘Y9’, sent by

the said Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe and Mr. Darshana Srinath Ranasinghe (The second

shareholder of the Petitioner company along with Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe), denying

that the said Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe resigned as a Director of the 1st Respondent

Company and without prejudice thereto, nominating three persons including the said

Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe, to be appointed to the Board of Directors of the 1st

Respondent Company in terms of Article 8(B)(I) of the Articles of Association of the 1st

Respondent Company (as indicated in document annexed as ‘Y4(b)’ )

The 2nd Respondent has proceeded to incorporate a company (the 5th

Respondent) under the name of “IDM Nations Campus Lanka (Pvt) Ltd” of business

registration number PV98554, incorporated on 13th May 2014 (Form 18 annexed as

‘Y10b’), with the 2nd Respondent as the sole shareholder, the 2nd and 3rd Respondent

as Directors and the 4th Respondent as Company Secretary (as mentioned in Form 1

annexed as ‘Y10a’ and Form 18 annexed as ‘Y10b’ respectively).

Subsequently, the Petitioner has submitted a letter dated 6th June 2014

(annexed as ‘Y11(a)’) to the Registrar of Companies bringing to attention the concerns

of the Petitioner in the incorporation of the 5th Respondent Company, requesting for

the Registrar of Companies to not permit the incorporation of the 5th Respondent.

Thereafter, the Registrar of companies has responded directing the Petitioner to file

an action by letter dated 30th June 2014 annexed as ‘Y11(b)’, following which the

Petitioner has preferred to the Commercial High Court by petition dated 15th

December 2014, leading to the action bearing No. HC (Civil) 59/2014 (CO).

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 25

The learned Judge of the High Court discussed the matter of Form 20 as the act

upon which the petition is based and issued an Order dated 03rd December 2015

refusing the grant of interim orders for the reason of laches on the part of the

Petitioner, in having delayed approximately 5 months in approaching the court,

deeming such delay to be unjustified and unreasonable.

The learned Judge also relies on the conduct of the Petitioner in failing to

exercise the remedy available under Section 483 of the Companies Act, in not having

made a complaint to the Police or the Registrar of Companies to obtain an order by a

Magistrate for the inspection or production of the suspected document alleged by the

Petitioner, when the Act expressly provides this remedy for such offence as is alleged

by the Petitioner.

Thereafter, the Petitioner has made an application to the Supreme Court by way

of petition dated 18th December 2015 and I hereby address the questions of law

abovementioned as follows:

Oppression and mismanagement.

The Petitioner makes claims under Section 224 for Oppression, Section 225 for

Mismanagement whilst seeking for relief under Section 521 of the Companies Act. In

the matter of oppression, Section 224 of the Companies Act reads as follows:

“(1) Subject to the provisions of section 226, any shareholder or

shareholders of a company who has a complaint against the company that

the affairs of such company are being conducted in a manner oppressive

to any shareholder or shareholders (including the shareholder or

shareholders with such complaint) may make an application to court, for

an order under the provisions of this section.

(2) Where on any application made under the provisions of subsection (1),

the court is of the opinion that the affairs of a company are being

conducted in a manner oppressive to any shareholder or shareholders of

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 25

the company, the court may with a view to remedying the matters

complained of, make such order as it thinks fit.

(3) Pending the making by it of a final order, the court may on the

application of a party to the proceedings, make an interim order which it

thinks is necessary for regulating the conduct of the company’s affairs,

upon such terms and conditions as appear to it to be just and equitable.

The provisions of section 521 shall apply to any interim order made

hereunder.”

The provisions for Oppression were introduced in order to allow for the protection

of Shareholders and it entitled them as of a right, to be treated without oppression as

a right, regardless of whether they are minority shareholders. The need for such a

remedy was made apparent by the increasing number of claims for winding up based

on prejudicial conduct against shareholders despite companies being solvent, as it was

the only remedy available to shareholders when faced with such difficulty. It was

observed that this position was detrimental to the interests of all parties involved given

the finality in the recourse of winding up. Thus is 1948 it could be seen that the United

Kingdom (UK) was compelled to introduce a satisfactory remedy that incorporated the

long-term interests of both the shareholders and company by providing justice and

continuity respectively despite the oppressive conduct in issue. Further, such remedy

allowed a shareholder to approach the courts in the event the majority shareholders

deviated from the best interests of the company

Section 210 of the UK Companies Act 1948 introduced a provision for Oppression

whereby members of a company were to make an application to court in the event of

oppressive conduct. This was less drastic and allowed courts to offer a large range of

remedies as it was to be what was deemed just and equitable by the Courts. Upon its

introduction in the United Kingdom, such remedy was considered to be novel,

however, the judgements of the UK courts and the 1948 legislation laid the framework

countries were to follow in the years to come. For instance, in the case of Scottish Co-

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 25

op Society v Meyers 1959 AC 324 it was considered that the question was not one

of whether the shareholder had been oppressed, but rather whether the “affairs of the

company had been conducted oppressively”. This approach was adopted by both

India and the Sri Lanka.

India not only recognized Oppression but introduced a provision for

‘mismanagement’ through the 1956 Act. This did not have a counterpart in the UK

legislation. Sri Lanka followed suit by enacting the Companies (Amendment) Act No.15

of 1964 and introduced the provisions for Oppression and Mismanagement based on

the Indian Companies Act, which was framed as alternative remedies to winding up.

Subsequently, the Companies Act no. 17 of 1982 carried forward the provisions of

oppression and mismanagement while approaching the remedies as a means of

recognizing and addressing the rights of shareholders, granting general powers to

Courts to remedy such conduct, as opposed to alternatives to winding up under the

previous regime.

In this backdrop, when the Companies Act no.7 of 2007 came into being, the

provisions were retained unaffected by the change in the UK as the Companies Act

2007 diverted from following the UK legislation. The alteration in phrasing of the

provision for Oppression from the word “oppression” to “unfairly prejudiced”

following the Companies Act 1980 under the UK law did not faze law makers in Sri

Lanka in adopting the express words Oppression and Mismanagement as part of the

Companies Act in 2007.

Thus, in light of the current position in the UK, it is appropriate to refer to the

jurisdiction of India which retains the concept of “Prevention of Oppression and

Mismanagement” in their current Companies Act of 2013.

Section 225 of the 2007 Companies Act in relation to Mismanagement

reads:

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 25

“ (1) Subject to the provisions of section 226, any shareholder or shareholders of

a company, having a complaint—

(a) that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner

prejudicial to the interests of the company; or

(b) that a material change (not being a change brought about by or in the

interest of any creditors, including debenture holders or any class of

shareholders of the company) has taken place in the management or control

of the company, whether by an alteration in its board of directors or of its

agent or secretary or in the constitution or control of the firm or body

corporate acting as its agent or secretary or in the ownership of the shares

of the company or in any other manner whatsoever, and that by reason of

such change it is likely that the affairs of the company may be conducted in

a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company, may make an

application to court for an order under the provisions of this section.”

It is important to note the distinction between Sections 224 and 225. Section 224

concerns acts oppressive towards shareholders whilst the focus of Section 225 is the

Company itself. Further, there are two limbs to Section 225, namely whether the affairs

of the company are being conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the

company as well as changes to board structure that affects or is likely to affect conduct

in such a prejudicial manner.

The second subsection recognizes the power of court to make such order as may

be suitable for the circumstances of each application if the court deems oppression

exists.

However, the third subsection is of importance in terms of this instant case as it

recognizes the power of courts to issue interim Orders in line with Section 521 in lieu

of a pending decision, in order to regulate conduct “upon such terms and conditions

as appear to it to be just and equitable.” Thus, this Court is empowered to decide upon

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 25

this matter of the issuance of Interim Orders prayed for under Sections 224,225 and

521.

Further, it is uncontested that the Petitioner fulfills the requirement of Section 226

and is thereby entitled to make such application for claims of Oppression and

Mismanagement in exercising his rights as a shareholder of the 1st Respondent

Company.

While there is no specification in the provision, it is generally accepted practice

that an isolated act of oppression does not entitle a shareholder to make an

application to the Court for relief on the basis that the affairs of a company are

conducted in a manner oppressive to a shareholder of a company. Rather, a series of

such acts of oppression are required for a shareholder to be entitled to make such

application to Court.

This is substantiated by the case of Needle Industries (India) Ltd v Needle

Industries Newey (India) Holding Ltd. AIR 1981 SC 1298 in which The Supreme

Court of India took the view that:

“An isolated act, which is contrary to law, may not necessarily and by itself

support the inference that the law was violated with a mala fide

intention…But a series of illegal acts following upon one another can, in

the context, lead justifiably to the conclusion that they are a part of the

same transaction, of which the object is to cause or commit the oppression

of persons against whom those acts are directed”

In the United Kingdom, the interpretation afforded to Section 210 of the English

Act of 1948, the final English Company Act to use the express word “oppression”, was

of a much narrower scope, as opposed to the broader phrasing “unfairly prejudicial”

adopted in 1980 and used as at present in the Companies Act 2006 in Section 994 and

995. For an application for a claim of oppression under the former Act, it was

insufficient to put forward a singular isolated incident.

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 25

Relying on the leading treatise of Company Law by Dr. Kang-Isvaran and

Wijayawardane, that the Respondent themselves rely on in their written submissions,

page 517 reads thus,

“Early decisions of court expressed the opinion that isolated acts or an act

of the past cannot be challenged under the rubric of ‘oppression’. This view

was criticized both in England and India as being too “onerous”.”

This cannot be construed to mean that an isolated incident is sufficient. On the

contrary, it is accepted in UK, India and Sri Lanka that whilst an isolated incident is

insufficient, there must in the least, be sufficient events that may be considered as part

of a continuing series of events, accumulating to a continuing story leading to the date

of Petition, even if there are no multiple disconnected events.

This is supported in the case of S. P. Jain vs Kalinga Tubes Ltd on 14

January, 1965 AIR 1535 in which Justice K Wanchoo held the following:

“There must be continuous acts on the part of the majority shareholders,

continuing up to the date of the petition, showing that the affairs of the

company were being conducted in a manner oppressive to some part of the

members.”

It must be noted that unlike the jurisdictions of India or the United Kingdom, Sri

Lanka does not have as an extensive or comprehensive guide of interpretation that

may be followed in instances of Oppression and Mismanagement. Udalgama J in

Ratnam and others v Jayathileka (2002) 1 Sri LR 409 supported this stance. He

went on to state that:

“when all the events are considered as part of the continuing story as

opposed to an individual event in isolation, that on a balance of probability

the affairs of the company appears to have been conducted in a manner

oppressive to the respondent”

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 25

Justice Udalgama arrived at this conclusion after being influenced by the definition

of the term oppression as given in the case of Re Harmer Ltd [1958] 3 All ER 689

where the courts held that the oppression includes acts or conduct which are

‘burdensome’, ‘harsh’ and ‘wrongful’. Further it could also be seen that as proposed

by the Australian courts in Re Bright Pine Mills Pty Ltd [1969] VR 1002 oppression

could also be by inertia. In this case it was seen that the directors ignored business

opportunities the company could have taken up so that another business in which

they were interested could take advantage of them.

The view taken by the Court of Appeal in the Ratnam case is correct as they have

recognized that oppression could not be an isolated act but one that is part of a

continuing story. It could also be seen that such an inactivity for it to be a considered

as oppression as envisaged by the Companies Act. This ensures that all acts must be

considered collectively and no act of oppression is disregarded based on a scale of

importance relative to the other acts of oppression present, while allowing for a

holistic view on the entirety of the circumstances surrounding any given case, as

opposed to focusing on a singular act.

Thus, it is established law that a singular isolated occurrence does not always fulfill

the threshold required for a claim of oppression and I will continue to uphold this view.

The requirement is such that there must be a series of which are caused by acts at the

very least which are burdensome, harsh, wrongful and/or due to an inactivity.

Upon examination of the facts and circumstances of this case, I am of the

opinion that there exists a prima facie case established by the Petitioner, upon

examination of evidence, based on a series of events amounting to oppression against

the Petitioner as a Shareholder and this conduct appears to amount to multiple acts

of Mismanagement of the company as provided for by Section 224 and 225

respectively.

As submitted, the Articles of Association of the 1st Respondent Company dated

27th June 2011 annexed as ‘Y4(b)’ was amended on 7th March 2013 by way of board

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 25

resolution on 5th March 2013, in regards to which the Registrar of Companies has been

informed by Secretary of company, the 4th Respondent, by Form 39 on 14th March

2013. It is observed that while the resolution is titled as being “on 5th March, 2013 at

11:00 am”, the Company Secretary has signed, filed and dated the document at the

footer as “Colombo, Dated: 7th March, 2012”. Following the amended Articles of

Association and the Companies Act No.7 of 2007, breaches would arise, should the

conduct be proven upon further investigation by the High Court.

Firstly, the matter of the alleged fraudulent Form 20, should it be so proven,

would amount to an act of Oppression against the Petitioner as a shareholder.

Secondly the non-appointment of a director following the removal of resignation in

order to represent the interests of the 50% shareholder would amount to oppression

against the Petitioner and Mismanagement prejudicial to the interests of the company.

Further, this is a violation of Article 8(A)(I) of the amended Articles of Association as it

requires for a Director of Group “A” to be appointed at the capacity of

Chairman/Deputy Chairman of the 1st Respondent company. Non-compliance with this

would, in essence, amount to a violation of Section 188 of the Companies Act by the

2nd and 3rd Respondent as well as violation of Section 16 of the Companies Act.

Additionally, it is a requirement of Article 8(G) (III) to promptly inform the bank

of any changes to authorized signatures. If such requirement is complied with, the

resignation is questionable given a cheque dated 11th November 2013, signed by both

Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe and the 2nd Respondent (annexed as ‘Y7(a)‘) has been

realized as according to the ordinary conduct of business (refer to document annexed

as ‘Y7(b)’), allowing for the impression that the signature continued to be an authorized

signature.

Finally, the incorporation of the 5th Respondent Company bearing a name, logo

and business activities largely similar to the 1st Respondent company, the diversion of

business from the 1st Respondent company to the 5th Respondent company and the

confusion caused by the above to the general public, must all be assessed as acts of

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 25

mismanagement given that each of the above is detrimental to the 1st Respondent

Company.

For reasons inclusive of the above concerns, the Petitioner has sufficiently

established a prima facie case based on multiple acts of alleged oppression and

mismanagement, leaving reason for this court to consider the questions of law and

interim orders as prayed for by the Petitioner.

In the judgement by the learned High Court judge, reference is only made to a

single act of oppression of the alleged forceful removal of Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe.

Therefore, I direct the High Court to revisit this matter paying due attention to the

existence of a series of claims of oppression and mismanagement.

Laches

The learned High Court judge has set aside the petition based on laches on the

part of the Petitioner based on the delay of a period of approximately 5 months

between the Petitioner being directed to approach the court by letter dated 30th June

2014 (’Y11(b)’) and the Petition dated 15th December 2014 in the High Court. However,

the source of any requirement of promptness or a period of time within which a claim

must be made is not made clear in the judgement by the learned High Court judge.

In examining the Sections 224, 225 and 521 of the Companies Act, Section 224

and 225 merely state that an aggrieved shareholder or shareholders

“may make an application to court for an order under the provisions of this

section.”

Section 521 does not specify a time frame within which a party must make an

application for interim orders. Therefore, this claim of undue delay is not based on

statutory grounds. In order to derive a time limit within which a claim must be brought,

we must refer to the basis of the present Companies Act. As discussed in Company

Law by Dr. Kang-Isvaran and Wijayawardane at page 12, one among the key

objectives of the introduction of a new Companies Act in 2007 was in order to bring

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 25

clarity to the law regarding companies. Many of the processes were simplified and

streamlined while minority shareholder rights were pertinently taken into account as

the previous legislation had failed to do. In this process of bringing clarity, time limits

for most processes have been introduced. For instance, in reference to the delay by

the Respondents, the time limit of 20 working days for the notice of resignation of a

Director, which the 1st-4th Respondents have failed to comply with as enumerated

above, is an express statutory time limit imposed by the Company Act, this Section

further stands evidence to the fact that the basis of the current Companies Act is to

provide clarity and streamline the process of the functioning of a company. For this

reason, it is not simple oversight by the legislators through which a time limit has not

been imposed on applications for oppressions and mismanagement

Examining the jurisdiction of India which retains the Section on Oppression and

upon judgements of which the Respondent bases a defense of laches on, the time limit

is not imposed directly through the Indian Companies Act 2013 but is imposed by

Section 137 of the Limitations Act of 1963. The section states applications must be

made within a period of 3 years. Such limit is to be considered “as the case may be”

according to Section 433 of the Indian Companies Act 2013. Even in relation to the

time bar of 3 years, there is therefore uncertainty as to its application as it is not directly

through the Companies Act 2013 of India, and the same act allows for discretion in the

application of this limitation and thus, in many cases this requirement is waived based

on circumstances of the case.

Further, as demonstrated in the case of A Brahmaraj vs. Sivakumar Spinning

Mills Pvt. Ltd., Tirunelveli-6 & Others (1984) 1 MLJ 376, it was considered in the

Madras High Court that:

"There could, therefore, be no doubt that the oppression or the conduct of

the affairs of the company in a manner prejudicial to the public interest has

to be continuous and shall have persisted up to the date of the filling of the

petition under s.397 and/or 398 of the Act. lf the state of affairs existing on

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 25

the petition is the main criterion for invoking the jurisdiction under Ss. 397

and 398 and the oppression complained of or the conduct of the affairs

complained of, should be existent on the date of the petition as in the case

of a continuing wrong and the relief asked for is only with a view to put an

end the matters complained of, we are unable to see how any question of

limitation could arise at all."

Thus, if the act of oppression and/or mismanagement complained of is

continuing in the state of affairs to the date of the petition, there is no reason for a

limitation to be imposed as the act of oppression has not concluded, despite isolated

trigger events being discussed.

Additionally, even in the cases where laches was seen as a ground for

applications to be barred by limitation, the laches were in the period of an extensive

number of years, as opposed to a number of months as in the instant case.

In the case of Shri Raj Kumar Gupta vs. D.P Gupta & Co. (P) Ltd. & others

(2008) 84 CLA 390 (CLB) the delay of 10 years was considered abnormal and such

delay was to be considered important regardless of the Limitations Act. In the case of

S. Sukhdeep Singh Jhikka vs S. Ajit Singh Deogan And Others (2009) 93 SCL 212

a period of 9 years was considered to be too lengthy and the court upheld the limit of

3 years. Hence it could be see that the court in India have applied the laches rule

subjectively after carefully considering each scenario.

In the United Kingdom, under the previous Act through which claims for

Oppression could be brought forward, it was considered that while laches could act as

a deterrent to claims, even a period of 4 years between the mentioned continuing act

and the petitioner making an application would not amount to laches limiting the

rights of the petitioner, as according to Peter Gibson J in Re a company (No 005134

of 1986), ex parte Harries, [1989] BCLC 383.

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 25

Therefore, considering the practical instances of delay or laches acting as a

deterrent to applications of Oppression, the periods considered to amount to laches

was in a span of a number of years as opposed to months while even the statutory

limit entertains applications made within 3 years in other jurisdictions.

One must also keep in mind the detriments of imposing a strict time limit for

applications under the provisions for Oppression and Mismanagement. A strict

numerical time limit, should it be so imposed, discourages resolution of conflict

outside of the system of courts as aggrieved shareholders would be inclined to resort

to legal redress through claims, in place of exercising any other remedies available to

them, both practically in the given circumstances and statutorily. It would not be

feasible for shareholders to waste time attempting to resolve conflict outside court at

the expense of the claim being time barred thereafter, should such attempts fail. It is

not in the best interest of Companies, shareholders or even of court to promote such

a view.

Additionally, any short period of time does not allow for the parties to further

investigate matters, gather evidence, resort to negotiation or further substantiate their

claim. It also creates the dilemma of the shareholders questioning the exact number

of claims that should exist to make a claim under Oppression and mismanagement as

one act is insufficient, but waiting for the commission of multiple or continuing acts

may limit the claim due to delay. This would be contrary to the basis of the Companies

Act in attempting to bring clarity to company law in Sri Lanka.

For this reason, it is my belief that the standard that must be adopted in

assessing the period of time in which a party is expected to bring a claim must take

into account the circumstances of each individual case, as opposed to a rigid numerical

standard. A standard of “a reasonable period of time in the given circumstances” is

more apt for the given purpose. This encompasses the standard of “as the case may

be” while not accommodating for extensive delays in terms of years having elapsed

following the commission of such activity in contravention of Section 224 or 225.

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 25

Thus, I am in no way refusing to acknowledge that laches and/or delay may be

a ground to refuse remedy under Section 521, however, such refusal must only be

resorted to where unjustifiable, unreasonable, or abnormal extensive delay exists. This

is in line with the lack of a statutory guideline of a numerical value of time, upon which

courts may take the facts of each case into account, in weighing reasonable

circumstance against legal principles.

In examining the instant case, I am of the view that this delay in application is

in no way an unjustifiable, unreasonable or abnormal extensive period of time, being

of 5 months, and thus does not amount to laches or complicity on the part of the

Petitioner.

Additionally, I am inclined to respectfully defer to the judgment by the learned

Judge of the High Court on multiple grounds. Firstly, as discussed above, the Petitioner

is not guilty of laches taking into account the period of delay in the instant case.

Secondly, the learned High Court judge has referred only to one of the claims made

by the petitioner and I am of the view that all relevant claims must be taken into

consideration in assessing the interim orders to be granted as such series has been

alleged and put forward by the Petitioner. Thirdly, the learned High court refers to

“interim injunctions” in the Order dated 3rd December 2015 whereas the Petitioner

expressly prays for Interim Orders, recognizing the distinction between the remedies.

Finally, I am of the view that the Petitioner’s claims are supported by evidence

additional to the claim of a forged letter which the Petitioner has failed to produce.

While I am in agreement with the learned High Court Judge in the fact that the

Petitioner has not sought redress through the remedies available under Section 483, I

defer in that this is attributable the larger claim of laches in relation to the series of

events claimed and the evidence produced in addition to Form 20.

Therefore, as enumerated above, I am of the view that the Petitioner is entitled

to remedies available under Section 521 of the Act.

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 25

Jurisdiction to grant interim orders

As enumerated above, both Section 224(3) and 225(3) allow for the court to

exercise its powers as provided for by Section 521 of the Companies Act, which states

as follows:

“(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3), pending the making

of a final order in any application or reference to court made under this

Act, the court may on the application of a party to the proceedings, make

such interim order, including a restraining order, as it thinks fit.”

In the instant case the Petitioner has made an application to the High Court

requesting for the grant of interim orders, which was refused. However, in examining

the present case, taking all above circumstances into account, I am of the view that

certain interim Orders as prayed for are justified in the interest of justice, and in

compliance with Section 225(3) in making an order that is “just and equitable”.

However, I wish to clarify the standard of intervention given the concern of

interference with the internal affairs of a company by a Court, being too intrusive. It is

my understanding that courts are cautious, and rightfully so, in exercising its powers

to intervene in the conduct of any Company. However, The Courts as a regulatory body

and as of bearing the obligations of upholding justice, must exercise such powers

where there is a lapse of such fairness or equity in such a manner that the Company

itself and stakeholders are threatened, Mismanaged and oppressed for the personal

benefit of those in control of the powerful tool that is a Company of a separate legal

personality.

This contention that the court does not have jurisdiction to interfere with the

internal affairs of the company has been addressed previously. For instance, in the case

of Burland and Others v. Earle and Others (1902) AC 83, it was held that it is an

elementary principle that a court has no jurisdiction to interfere with the internal

management of companies acting within their powers. Another case is that of Lee v.

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 23 of 25

Chou Wen Hsein and Others (1985) B CLC 45, where a Director was expelled by his

fellow Directors it was held that even if one or more Directors acted from ulterior

motives the expulsion would be effective; presumably this is because the act of the

other Directors if improperly motivated is voidable not void.

However, the stance in Sri Lanka was confirmed by the case of Unipak Ltd. And

Others V. Amarasena 2002 3 SLR 173 in which A. M. Somawansa, J. in the Court of

Appeal were to decide on a case with the material facts bearing certain similarities to

the instant case. The Learned Judge upon discussing the prior mentioned cases

Burland and Others v. Earle and Others and Lee v. Chou Wen Hsein and Others

further mentioned the case of Re the Langham Skating Rink Company (1877) 36

CT 605 and stated as follows:

“However, it appears to me that another elementary principle originates

from these decisions and that is that if the acts complained of are ultra

vires its powers then the court will interfere. This principle was recognized

in Re The Langham Skating Rink Company where it was observed that

the power to manage the affairs of a company vests with the Directors

and it is settled law that a court will not interfere with such power unless

strong grounds are shown for doing so.”

In the Unipak case, it could be seen that the petitioner-respondent has shown

strong grounds for the court to interfere. One being her unlawful removal from the

Board of Directors on or about 27th December, 1984, by the 2nd and 3rd respondents-

appellants. In the petition of appeal as well as in the written submissions filed by the

respondents-appellants it is contended that the respondents-appellants acted well

within the powers conferred on them by the Articles of Association in removing the

petitioner-respondent from the Board of Directors. Unfortunately, except for the bare

statement that they acted well within the powers conferred on them by the Articles of

Association the respondents- no appellants have failed to adduce any evidence to

establish this fact. No evidence as to the procedure adopted was in conformity with

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 24 of 25

the powers conferred on them by the Articles of Association or in fact that they

adopted any procedure other than informing the Registrar of Companies that the

petitioner-respondent has been removed from the Board of Directors. In fact, there is

no evidence that the removal was communicated to the petitioner-respondent.

As in the above mentioned facts, there is no reasons upon examination of the

prima facie case to believe that the Respondents proceeded to remove Director Dr.

Bandusena Ranasinghe in an exercise of powers intra vires or for the best interests of

the Company. There is no reason as at present, based on the arguments by the

Respondents, to believe that the 2nd – 4th Respondents incorporated the 5th

Respondent Company or continued to conduct business in competition with the 1st

Respondent Company for the best interest of the 1st Respondent Company or the

Petitioner. Thus, I am of the view that there exist strong grounds to grant Interim orders

as necessary, upon such terms and conditions as appear Just and Equitable in the

instant case, as required by sections 224(3) and 225(3).

Conclusion

With the aforementioned circumstances, I answer the question of law raised by

the Petitioner affirmatively.

On careful analysis of the materials that was produced before the learned High

Court Judge, I am of the view that the finding of the learned High Court in order dated

03.12.2015 in case no. 59/2014/Co is incorrect. Accordingly, I grant the following

interim orders:

a) an Interim Order setting aside the resignation of Dr. Bandusena Ranasinghe

from the position of Director of the 1st Respondent Company, as

enumerated in the submitted Form 20.

SC Appeal 58/16 JUDGMENT Page 25 of 25

b) an Interim Order restraining the 5th Respondent from engaging in any

business activity in competition with the 1st Respondent Company except to

the extent contractually obligated as at the date of this petition.
