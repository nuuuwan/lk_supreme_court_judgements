3 Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Applicant-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) had filed a Special

Leave to Appeal Application before this court after her application for Leave to Appeal made under

section 14 (2) of the Maintenance Act No 37 of 1999 was rejected by the learned High Court Judge

of Kalutara. On 29th October 2015, the said Special Leave to Appeal Application was supported and

the court granted (Special Leave) on the questions of law set out in the paragraph 19 (a), (b) and (c)

of the Petition dated 13th of November 2014 which reads as follows;

(a) Did both the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge err in law in failing to

consider the inadequacy of evidence to establish that the RespondentRespondent

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) has sufficiently maintained the

children as provided by the section 2 (2) of the Maintenance Act No 37 of 1999 (hereinafter

referred to as the Maintenance Act or the Act) and thereby failed to make a maintenance

order in respect of the elder child?

(b) Did both the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge err in law in accepting the

evidence of witnesses called on behalf of the Respondent, who were interested and partial?

(c) Has the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the amount of maintenance which

has been awarded in respect of the 2nd child is inadequate in the light of the means and

circumstances of the petitioner who is caring for the said child?

As revealed before this court, the Petitioner has filed a Maintenance Application in terms of the

Section 2 (2) of the Maintenance Act in the Magistrate Court of Horana seeking a maintenance order

of Rs 10,000/- for the eldest child and Rs 20,000/- for the youngest child who is suffering from

hyperactive disorder and needs special care. The learned Magistrate having considered the

4 application of the Petitioner, made an interim maintenance order in terms of the section 2 (2) of the

Maintenance Act to pay a sum of Rs 5000/- for each child per month.

During the inquiry before the Magistrates Court, the Petitioner herself and one witness, namely Don

Bandusena Wijesuriya representing the Bank of Ceylon gave evidence, and her case was closed.

During the Respondents case, the Respondent and four other witnesses gave evidence. At the

conclusion of the inquiry, the learned Magistrate had delivered the judgment making a maintenance

order of Rs 10,000/- only with regard to the younger child. The learned Magistrate made no

Maintenance order with regard to the eldest child who was only 13 years old at that time.

Being dissatisfied with the said Judgment of the learned Magistrate dated 13th December 2012, the

Petitioner had preferred an Appeal to the Provincial High Court of Kalutara by Petition dated 26th

December 2012. The learned High Court Judge who considered the said Appeal had dismissed the

Petitioners appeal and affirmed the Judgment of the learned Magistrate.

Being aggrieved by the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 02nd of October 2014, the

Petitioner sought Leave to Appeal from the Provincial High Court of Kalutara in terms of Section 14

(2) of the Maintenance Act, but the said Application was refused by the High Court and the Petitioner

had come before the Supreme Court by way of a Special Leave to Appeal.

As observed by this court, the entire case for the Petitioner is based on the section 2 (2) of the

Maintenance Act which reads as follows;

Where any parent having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain his or her child

who is unable to maintain himself or herself, the Magistrate may upon an application being

made for maintenance and upon proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make

a monthly allowance for the maintenance of such child at such monthly rate the Magistrate

5

thinks fit, having regard to the income of the parents and the means and circumstance of

the child.

[emphasis added by me]

When going through the aforementioned provision, it can be identified that in a maintenance

application, filed before a Magistrate seeking a maintenance order, the discretion to decide the

maintenance allowance for the children is vested upon the Magistrate who acts under the above

provision. In addition to this, there is a requirement under the section 2 (2), of the Act, such person

against whom the maintenance order is made should have sufficient means to maintain his or her

child and then neglects or refuses to maintain the child as the case may be. With regard to the

question of sufficient means, it is an admitted fact that both the Petitioner as well as the Respondent

were employed as Samurdi Development Officers and drawing a monthly salary. In addition to the

above, the Petitioner had taken up the position that a considerable amount from her salary was

deducted as a monthly installment for a housing loan she has obtained and the Respondent had

additional income by engaged in journalism and photography as part-time jobs.

Even though the Respondent had disputed some of the sources referred to above, I see no reason to

consider them in my Judgment since, for me the main question that has to be considered by this

court is not, whether the Respondent had sufficient income to maintain his children but, whether

the Respondent had neglected to maintain his children.

Accordingly, I will now proceed to consider the main question that is to be considered in the instant

case, i.e. whether the Respondent has sufficiently maintained the two children as required by the

section 2 (2) of the said Act.

6 As referred by me in this judgment, the Petitioner gave evidence before the learned Magistrate at

the inquiry, that was held under sections 12 and 13 of the Act and summoned another bank official

to give evidence on behalf of her.

In her evidence before the Magistrate she explained the expenditure she has to undergo for her two

children with special reference to the additional expenditure she has to meet with regard to their

youngest son who is taking treatment for Hyperactive disorder including medicine, doctors charges

and salary of an attendant.

Under cross examination, the Petitioner admitted that the Respondent had shared the day to day

expenses including the gas bill, electricity and telephone bills and some other expenditures until

August 2009 but took up the position that after August 2009 the relationship between her and her

husband had deteriorated and thereafter her husband did not spend anything for their family. In

April 2010, she decided to file the instant application before the Magistrates Court. However, she

continued to stay in the same house belongs to her husband.

However, when she was further cross examined with regard to the payments of utility bills, she

admitted the Respondent making those payment as follows;

When she was further cross examined with regard to the medical expenditure for the youngest child,

she admitted that the Respondent accompanied her and the child to several hospitals and met those

expenditure. However, when the Petitioner was cross examined with regard her request, her answer

was that she needs maintenance to cover the basic needs only. The said question and answer read

as follows;

Among the several witnesses summoned by the Respondent to give evidence on behalf of him, the

Respondent had summoned his 13 years old eldest son Nadula Tharupathi de Silva to give evidence

on behalf of him. During the examination in chief witness admitted the following

[At page 214 of the brief]

When the above evidence is considered with the evidence of the Petitioner and the Respondent, it

appears that the Respondent was looking after the expenditure of home as well as the two children

until the maintenance action was filed in April 2010. According to the evidence of Nadula Tharupathi,

the eldest son of both the Petitioner and the Respondent, the Respondent continued to look after

some of their requirements including the bus season tickets even after the maintenance action was

pending before the Magistrates Court.

9 The Respondent whilst testifying before the Magistrate, confirmed that he met some of the

expenditure at home and most of the expenditure of the children until the instant case was filed

before the Magistrates Court, and started paying maintenance based on the interim order made by

the learned Magistrate thereafter.

However, during the arguments before us, the learned Presidents Counsel who represented the

Petitioner, argued the importance of making an order based on the proportionality of the income of

both parties when the Petitioner as well as the Respondent are employed and drawing monthly

salaries. If one party is purposely ignoring the maintenance of his or her children, an order based on

proportionality might help the other party to ease the additional burden on herself or himself but,

when going through the evidence led before the Magistrate, at the inquiry held under the provision

of the Maintenance Act No 37 of 1999, it is clear that there was adequate evidence to establish that

the Respondent too had helped the family, even after the instant application was pending before the

Magistrates Court.

When the Respondent started paying Maintenance as per the interim order, he had stopped making

certain payments but, that cannot be considered against him in the absence of any complaint that

he failed to obey the court order.

In the case of the Sinaval vs. Nagappa (1916) Volume VI Balasinghams Note of Cases 26, Shaw J

observed:

Maintenance cases are in the nature of civil proceedings, and the Court of Appeal, although

sitting by way of re-hearing, ought to give very great weight to the finding of fact of the

Magistrate who has seen the witnesses, and ought not to reverse his decision on a question

of fact unless it is clear from the evidence or from some undisputed fact that he has gone

wrong

10 On perusal of the facts of the instant case, it is observed that there is no necessity to interfere with

the findings of the learned Magistrate who has come to a correct finding that the Petitioner has failed

to provide adequate evidence to establish that the Respondent has not sufficiently maintained the

children as provided by the section 2(2) of the Maintenance Act, at the time the maintenance action

was filed before the Magistrates Court.

In addition, the learned Magistrate has made an Order for the Respondent to pay Rs.10,000/- for the

younger child. Such amount of maintenance allowance is not for the total refusal or neglect on the

part of the Respondent to maintain the younger child, but to cover the extra expenditure to be

incurred by the mother for medical expenditure of the 2nd child.

For the reasons given in my judgment I see no reason to interfere with the findings of both the

learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge of Kalutara.

The appeal is dismissed. No Costs.
