S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

I find it pertinent to establish the facts of the case prior to addressing the issues

before us. The employee W.K.P.I Rodrigo i.e. Applicant Appellant Appellant,

(hereinafter referred to as Employee Appellant) was recruited by Central Engineering

Consultancy Bureau i.e. Respondent Respondent Respondent (hereinafter referred to

as Employer Respondent) as a Civil Engineer Grade D1, in January 1986. The Employee

Appellant was suspended on a disciplinary issue on the 26th of August 2011, was found

guilty upon the conclusion of the disciplinary inquiry and was terminated from

employment on the 14th of October 2013.

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 31

Being aggrieved with the termination of employment, the Employee Appellant

filed a fundamental rights application in the Supreme Court bearing No. SC FR 395/2013

against the Employer Respondent by petition dated 18.11.2013 alleging that the

termination of his services was a breach of his fundamental rights enshrined in Article

12(1), 12(2) and 14(1) (g) of the Constitution. Subsequently the Employee Appellant filed

an application against the Employer Respondent in the Labour Tribunal of Colombo on

the 17.03.2014 (Application No. 01/Add/19/2014) challenging the termination of his

services.

The Employer Respondent filed its answer and raised the preliminary objection

under Section 31 B (5) of the Industrial Disputes Act No.43 of 1950 (as amended), that the

Employee Appellant could not maintain an application before the Labour Tribunal due

to the fact that he had first filed a fundamental rights application before the Supreme

Court.

After the preliminary objection was raised, the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal asked both parties to file written submissions. Thereafter the preliminary

objection was upheld and the Employee Appellants application was dismissed.

Being dissatisfied with the order dated 03.09.2014 of the Labour Tribunal, the

Employee Appellant appealed to the High Court of the Western Province Holden in

Colombo (Appeal No. HCALT 83/2014 dated 01.10.2014). The learned Judge of the High

Court upheld the order of the Labour Tribunal and dismissed the appeal of the Employee

Appellant.

Being aggrieved with the said Order of the High Court, the Employee Appellant

preferred an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court and leave to appeal

was granted on the questions of law set out in paragraph 13 (a) to (f) of the petition.

Previously, this matter was heard before a bench comprising of Hon. Chief Justice

Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, late Hon. Justice Prasanna Jayawardane, PC and myself on

17/07/2019. The Counsel for the Employee Appellant, Geoffrey Alagratnam PC

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 31

submitted to Court detailed and comprehensive written submissions and made extensive

oral submissions on behalf of the Employee Appellant. When this case was recalled for

argument the Employee Appellant appeared in person and relied on the written

submissions made on behalf of him on 03/08/2018. As this matter was previously heard,

I have had the benefit of engaging in extensive discussions with my late brother regarding

various issues in this matter and wish to acknowledge his invaluable contribution which

was of immense help for me to capture all salient features and develop this judgment.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Employee Appellant submitted that the

petitioners appeal would be confined to three questions of law. They are as follows;

(a) Did the learned High Court Judge err in law in not appreciating the scope and

purpose and/ or wording of

A Section 31 B (3) and/or

B Section 31 B (5) of the Industrial Disputes Act?

(b) Did the learned High Court Judge err in holding that two cases cannot be filed on

the same incident?

(c) Did the learned High Court Judge err in law in upholding the Order of the Labour

Tribunal on the grounds stated and in deciding to dismiss the Application and

petition filed by the Petitioner?

The issue of law to be decided in this appeal is whether the provisions of section

31B (5) of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950, as amended, debar the Employee

Appellant from maintaining his application to the Labour Tribunal against the termination

of his services by the Employer - Respondent, for the reason that the Employee

Appellant had previously filed a fundamental rights application No. SC FR 395/2013 in

this Court claiming that the said termination of his services by the Employer - Respondent

violated his fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12 (1), 12 (2) and 14 (1) (g) of the

Constitution.

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 31

The Counsel for the Employer - Respondent, relying on Section 31B (5), submitted

that the Employee Appellant is precluded from filing an application before the Labour

Tribunal on the ground that he had first filed a Fundamental Rights Application bearing

No. SC FR 395/2013. He submitted that although an employee can challenge termination

of his services in several forums including the Labour Tribunal, District Court and Supreme

Court, he cannot seek legal remedies from multiple forums in respect of the same issue /

dispute (i.e. the termination of services).

Section 31 B (5) of the Industrial Disputes Act is reproduced below for easy reference.

Section 31 B (5)

Where an application under subsection (1) is entertained by a labour tribunal and

proceedings thereon are taken and concluded, the workman to whom the application

relates shall not be entitled to any other legal remedy in respect of the matter to

which that application relates, and where he has first resorted to any other legal

remedy, he shall not thereafter be entitled to the remedy under subsection (1)

The determination of this question requires us to ascertain the intention and

purpose of the Legislature when it enacted section 31B (5) and, in that light, to identify

the proper scope of section 31B (5). Doing so will require an examination of the

background to the introduction of Part IVA of the Act which contains the provisions

relating to Labour Tribunals, including section 31B (5). Part IVA was introduced by the

Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act No. 62 of 1957. Part IVA initially had four sections

- ie: sections 31A, 31B, 31C and 31D. These sections have been subjected to a few

amendments since 1957. Further, new sections 31DD, 31DDD [later repealed] and

31DDDD were added to Part IVA, by other Amendments to the Industrial Disputes Act.

As indicated in its long title, the Industrial Disputes Act was enacted in 1950 with

the aim of preventing, investigating and settling industrial disputes and for matters

connected therewith or incidental thereto. It has been long recognised that the overall

purpose of the Act is to maintain and promote industrial peace. Thus, in Colombo

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 31

Appothecaries Co. Ltd Vs. Wijesooriya [70 NLR 481 at p. 490], G.P.A. Silva J said that

..there can be hardly any doubt-that the sole object of the Act is the promotion and

maintenance of industrial peace. and Tennekoon J, as he then was, observed [at p.507],

It has been said frequently, and quite recently reiterated by their Lordships of the Privy

Council that the purpose and object of the Act is the maintenance and promotion of

industrial peace .. .

In its original form, the Act provided, inter alia, for the Minister to refer an industrial

dispute to an Industrial Court or to Arbitration, for settlement. There was no provision for

a workman who was aggrieved by the termination of his services by his employer, to

unilaterally seek relief under the Act. Instead, he had to obtain the intervention of the

Minister to seek relief under the Act. That lacuna was rectified with the enactment of the

aforesaid Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act No. 62 of 1957 which introduced a new

Part IVA to the Act containing provisions for the establishment of Labour Tribunals as a

special forum established by the State to enable workmen to seek relief in instances where

they complain of a termination of their services. As eloquently explained by Lord Guest

and Lord Devlin in their renowned dissenting judgment in the Privy Council decision of

The United Engineering Workers Union vs. Devanayagam [69 NLR 289 at p.304-305]

The Act thus employed the known ways of settling the ordinary trade dispute.

But it did not include any simple way of remedying a grievance which an

individual workman might have against his employer. Suppose, for example, that

a workman was dismissed with such notice as the common law thinks reasonable

but which a fair-minded employer nowadays probably accepts as inadequate; or

suppose he was dismissed because of reduction in the labour force but without the

ex gratia payment which a reasonably generous employer would nowadays think

appropriate. The aggrieved workman in such a case could seek the help of his

trade union which could threaten industrial action. Then there might be a

reference which might result in the workman obtaining better treatment and in

an award to govern similar cases in the future A swift way of dealing with an

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 31

individual grievance without calling out the whole force of trade unionism would

certainly help to promote industrial peace. It was supplied by an amending Act of

1957. This Act enlarged the definition of industrial dispute so as to make it clear

that it included a dispute or difference between an individual employer and an

individual workman. It inserted into the Act a new part, Part IV A, entitled `Labour

Tribunals. The function of the Labour Tribunal is to entertain applications by a

workman for relief or redress in respect of such matters relating to the terms of

employment or the conditions of labour as may be prescribed. The particular

matters specified in the Act are those which we have already mentioned by way

of example, namely, questions arising out of the termination of the workman's

services and relating to gratuities or other benefits payable on termination. On

such matters the Tribunal is to make such order as may appear to it to be just and

equitable.

Identifying the purpose for which the Legislature introduced Labour Tribunals in

1957, S.R. De Silva, the renowned writer on Industrial Law, states [The Legal Framework of

Industrial Relations at p. 293] In 1957 the State, by amending legislation, created bodies

known as labour tribunals to ensure job security by safeguarding against involuntary

termination of employment except for good cause..

Thus, 31A (1) of the Act, post the aforesaid amendment, empowers the Minister

to establish Labour Tribunals. Next, sections 31B (1) (a), (b) and (c) provide that a

workman [or a trade union on his behalf] may make a written application to a Labour

Tribunal for relief or redress in respect of the termination of his services and/or the

gratuity or benefits due to him from his employer upon the termination of his services.

[Section 31B (1) (d) states that a workman may make and application to a Labour Tribunal

in respect of such other matters as the Minister may prescribe. However, that provision is

not relevant to the question before us].

Thereafter, section 31C (1) states that, when such an application is made to it, it

shall be the duty of the Labour Tribunal to make inquiries into that application and, when

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 31

doing so, to hear all such evidence as the Labour Tribunal considers necessary and,

thereafter, make an Order which the Labour Tribunal considers is just and equitable.

Section 31B (4) read with section 31C (1) make it clear that a Labour Tribunal is not

limited by the terms and conditions of the contract of service between the workman and

the employer when making an Order which it considers to be just and equitable. Thus, for

example, section 33 (1) (b) in Part VI of the Act which contains the General provisions

applicable to the Act, states that a Labour Tribunal is empowered, where it considers it

appropriate, to order that a workman whose services have been terminated, be reinstated

in service even though, as is well known, the relief of specific performance is unavailable

in a contract for personal services other than in a few exceptional circumstances.

These provisions show that the Legislature established Labour Tribunals with the

intention of giving workmen whose services had been terminated by their employer, a

special forum which was constituted to determine applications against the employer for

relief in respect of the termination of services and to ensure that a workman could make

such an application with relative ease. It is also evident that, in order to achieve this

intention, the Legislature considered it necessary to invest Labour Tribunals with

substantial powers and the discretion to grant relief on a just and equitable basis,

untrammelled by the terms and conditions of the contract of services and the common

law of master and servant.

However, a perusal of the other provisions in Part IVA of the Act, make it clear that,

when establishing Labour Tribunals, the Legislature kept in mind the overall purpose of

the Act - which was to maintain and promote industrial peace for the common good of

society. Thus, some of the provisions in Part IVA of the Act demonstrate that Parliament

took care to ensure that, while giving workmen the right to `directly make an application

to a Labour Tribunal seeking relief in respect of the termination of services by their

employers, that right is not permitted to interrupt or prejudice other proceedings in which

matters relevant to the application are being considered. This safeguard is seen in section

31B (2) (a), section 31B (3) (a) and section 31B (3) (b) of the Act.

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 31

Thus, section 31B (2) (a) specifies that, where a Labour Tribunal is satisfied that

the termination of services which is the subject matter of an application made to it, is

under discussion between the employer-respondent and the trade union of which the

workman is a member, the Labour Tribunal must suspend hearing the application until

the conclusion of those discussions and, in the event those discussions lead to a

settlement, the Labour Tribunal must make Order in terms of that settlement. It is also

implicit in section 31B (2) (a) that, even if the discussions do not end in a settlement, a

Labour Tribunal should consider what transpired during such discussions when it makes

its final Order.

On broadly comparable lines, section 31B (3) (a) and section 31B (3) (b) specify

that: (a) where a Labour Tribunal is of the opinion that an application made to it relates

to any matter which is similar to or identical with a matter constituting or included in an

industrial dispute in respect of which there is an inquiry proceeding in terms of the Act

and to which the same employer is a party; or, (b) where a Labour Tribunal is of the

opinion that the facts affecting an application made to it are facts which affect any other

proceeding under any other law; the Labour Tribunal must suspend hearing the

application until the conclusion of that inquiry or proceeding and, thereafter, resume

hearing the application having regard to the award or decision of the inquiry or

proceeding.

It is apparent that the aforesaid section 31B (2) (a) and sections 31B (3) (a) and

31B (3) (b) are designed to ensure that the hearing of an application made to a Labour

Tribunal does not run contrary to or prejudice: (i) related discussions between the same

employer and a trade union of which the applicant is a member; or (ii) related inquiries,

under and in terms of the Act, into an industrial dispute, to which the same employer is a

party; or (iii) proceedings under any other law which are relevant to that application. In

other words, these three statutory provisions seek to harmonize a Labour Tribunals

hearing of an application made to it with other directly relevant proceedings and, thereby,

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 31

promote the overall purpose of the Act, which is to maintain and promote industrial peace

for the common good of society.

At the same time, it is evident from two other provisions in Part IVA of Act - namely,

section 31B (2) (b) and section 31B (5) - that, when the Legislature introduced Labour

Tribunals, it wished to ensure that the right it gave any workman who is aggrieved by the

termination of his services, to make an application to a Labour Tribunal with relative ease,

should not permit that workman to obtain relief in respect of the termination of his

services from both a Labour Tribunal and also from court or other forum which is

empowered by law to grant relief to him in respect of the same termination of his services.

Needless to say, permitting a workman to obtain relief in respect of the termination of his

services from both a Labour Tribunal and also from court or other forum would not be

conducive to the overall purpose of the Act, which is to maintain and promote industrial

peace for the common good of society.

Accordingly, section 31B (2) (b) specifies that, in cases where the Labour Tribunal

is satisfied that the subject matter of an application made to it constitutes or forms part

of an industrial dispute which is already before an Industrial Court or an Arbitration under

the Act, the Labour Tribunal must dismiss that application without prejudice to those

proceedings before the Industrial Court or Arbitration. It is apparent that this provision is

founded on the policy that a Labour Tribunal should not proceed, under and in terms of

the Industrial Disputes Act, to separately hear and determine an Industrial Dispute which

has been previously referred by the Commissioner of Labour or the Minister for settlement

to Arbitration or to an Industrial Court under the provisions of sections 3 or 4 of the same

Act.

To turn to section 31B (5), it is evident that this statutory provision has two limbs.

The first limb of section 31B (5) states that a workman who has previously made an

application to a Labour Tribunal in respect of the termination of his services and has had

that application decided by the Labour Tribunal, shall not be entitled to any other legal

remedy in respect of the matter to which that application relates. Conversely, the second

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 31

limb of section 31B (5) states that where a workman has first resorted to any other legal

remedy, he shall not thereafter be entitled to the remedy available under section 31B (1)

of the Act - ie: the remedy available in an application to a Labour Tribunal.

It is evident that the first limb of section 31B (5) has the effect of ousting the

jurisdiction of the courts [and other fora which are statutorily authorised to determine

disputes relating to the termination of services of a workman] if the circumstances

referred to in the first limb exist. In this regard, it is a long established and salutary rule

that statutory provisions can have the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the courts only

if there is clear and unambiguous language to establish such an ouster. Thus, MAXWELL

[3rd ed. at p.153] refers to

the well-known rule that a statute should not be construed as taking away the

jurisdiction of the courts in the absence of clear and unambiguous language to

that effect..

It follows that first limb of section 31B (5) should be given a restrictive

interpretation which is confined to the specific circumstances described in this statutory

provision. Next, it is evident that the second limb of section 31B (5) has the effect of

ousting the jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal if the circumstances referred to in that

statutory provision exist. However, the rationale and policy considerations which brought

about the introduction of Labour Tribunals in 1957, which were mentioned earlier, dictate

that the right of workmen to invoke the jurisdiction of a Labour Tribunal must not be

restricted beyond the proper scope of the second limb of section 31B (5). Thus, it follows

that the second limb of section 31B (5) also should be given a restrictive interpretation

which is confined to the specific circumstances described in that statutory provision.

The effect of the first limb of section 31B (5) is clear as it explicitly precludes a

workman from obtaining a determination by a Labour Tribunal of his application for relief

or redress in respect of the termination of his services and, thereafter, proceeding to

obtain another legal remedy in respect of the same subject matter from any other forum,

whether that forum be a court of law, or a forum constituted under any of the provisions

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 31

of the Act other than those in Part IVA of the Act, or any other forum which has the legal

authority to determine such complaints.

Thus, in Devanayagam [at p. 305], Lord Guest and Lord Devlin appear to have had

the first limb of section 31B (5) in mind when Their Lordships commented that

The workman has to make his choice between the remedy afforded by the Act and

any other legal remedy he may have; he cannot seek both. If he goes to the Tribunal,

the Tribunal's order settles the matter and is not to be called in question in any court

except that there may be an appeal to the Supreme Court on a question of law..

This view is reinforced by the statement [at p.313] made by Lord Guest and Lord Devlin in

relation to section 31B (2) (b) of the Act, that a dismissal of an application to a Labour

Tribunal under that provision

does not preclude the workman from pursuing his rights at common law since under

s. 31B (5) they are excluded only where proceedings before the Tribunal are taken

and concluded..

It is apparent that the question of whether the first limb of section 31B (5) will apply and

debar a workman from maintaining an action in a court [or an application to another

forum], by reason of the fact that the same workman has previously received a

determination in respect of the same subject matter in an application made by him to a

Labour Tribunal, is a question that will have to be decided by that court [or other forum].

It is not a question that will come to the attention of a Labour Tribunal. I would also state

here that, apart from section 31B (5) being designed to maintain and promote industrial

peace, it is self-evident that the first limb of section 31B (5) is also founded on the

principle of Res Judicata.

The second limb of section 31B (5) states that, where a workman has first resorted

to any other legal remedy, he shall not thereafter be entitled to make an application to a

Labour Tribunal under section 31B (1) of the Act. The Act does not define what is meant

by the phrase legal remedy. As discussed above, the phrase any other legal remedy as

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 31

used in the first limb of section 31B (5), means a legal remedy subsequently sought from

any forum other than a Labour Tribunal, to obtain relief or redress in respect of the subject

matter of the workmans previous application to a Labour Tribunal made under section

31B (1) of the Act. However, unlike in the first limb of section 31B (5), in which the words

in respect of the matter to which that application relates follow up and accompany the

phrase any other legal remedy, the said phrase as used in the second limb of section

31B (5) stands alone without any accompanying words to clarify its meaning.

Consequently, it is necessary to identify what the Legislature meant when it used the

phrase any other legal remedy in the second limb of section 31B (5).

In circumstances such as this, it is an established rule of statutory interpretation

that a Court is entitled to look at the other related provisions of the Act to understand the

context in which the phrase any other legal remedy has been used in the second limb of

section 31B (5) and, thereby, identify the correct meaning of the phrase for the purposes

of section 31B (5). As Bindra [INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES 7th ed. at p.301] states,

It is, however, equally well settled that the meaning of the words used in any

portion of the statute must depend on the context in which they are placed.

Moreover, in interpreting an enactment all its parts must be construed together

as forming one whole and it is not in accordance with sound principles of

construction to consider one section, or group of sections alone, divorced from

the rest of the statute. Further, so far as possible, the construction must be

placed upon words used in any part of the statute which makes them consistent

with remaining provisions and with the intention of the Legislature to be derived

from a consideration of the enactment.

When the approach set out above is used, it is evident that the phrase any other

legal remedy in the second limb of section 31B (5) echoes and should be understood to

have the same meaning as it has in the first limb of section 31B (5). Thus, it can be

concluded with certainty that the phrase any other legal remedy in the second limb of

section 31B (5) is limited in its meaning to any other legal remedy which the workman

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 31

has previously sought in a court or other forum in respect of the termination of his services

and which had the same subject matter as his subsequent application to the Labour

Tribunal.

Consequently, the second limb of section 31B (5) applies only in instances where

the other legal remedy sought by the workman in any another forum [whether that

forum be a court, or a forum constituted under any of the provisions of the Act other than

those in Part IVA of the Act, or any other forum which has the legal authority to determine

such complaints]: (i) covered the same or similar ground and had the same or similar

scope; and (ii) sought the same or similar substantive reliefs, as his subsequent application

to a Labour Tribunal. For the reasons referred to earlier, this conclusion can be properly

reached upon reading the provisions of the Act and applying the aforesaid established

rule of statutory interpretation. Thus, S.R. De Silva has, referring to the second limb of

section 31B (5), stated [at p.345], The principle of res judicata enshrined in this provision

operates only where the matter in dispute is the same in both remedies sought by the

workman.. [emphasis added by me].

I would mention a third limitation/qualification to the circumstances in which the

second limb of section 31B (5) may be properly invoked. To my mind, this limitation

follows as a corollary to the conclusion set out above. That third limitation is: the other

legal remedy sought previously by the workman in a court or other forum [which has the

legal authority to determine such complaints]; and the workmans subsequent application

to the Labour Tribunal; would both have to be decided upon the core issue of whether

the termination of the workmans services by the employer was done for good cause.

Inevitably, there might be some difference between the principles which would be

applied by such court or other forum when deciding this core issue, and the principles

that would be applied by a Labour Tribunal when it decides this core issue. Consequently,

taking a view that the principles that are to be applied must by the court or other forum

and by the Labour Tribunal, must be the same, will render section 31B (5) nugatory. To

illustrate by way of an example, a court of law will decide by applying the common law

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 31

and the terms and conditions of the contract of services when deciding an action relating

to a workmans claim for relief consequent to the termination of his services, while a

Labour Tribunal will decide an application made to it, by testing whether the termination

of services was just and equitable without being confined by the terms and conditions of

the contract of services. Hence, although the two forums need not necessarily apply the

same principles for the second limb of section 31B (5) to come into effect, the application

of this provision is qualified/limited if the core issue before the court or other forum and

the Labour Tribunal relates to whether the termination of the workmans services by the

employer was done for good cause, according to the principles which are to be applied

by the court or other forum. When voicing this further limitation, I am fortified by broadly

comparable views expressed by Tilakawardane J in Tri-Star Apparels Exports (Pvt) Ltd

vs. Gajanayake [SC Appeal No. 85/2003 decided on 19th October 2004 at p.12-13] and

by Sisira De Abrew J in Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation vs. Dharmawansa,

[2006 1 SLR 346 at p.348-349]. These decisions are discussed later on.

It also appears that, in order for the second limb of section 31B (5) to apply, there

should not be a significant disparity between the procedure followed by the court or other

forum when it determines an action or application in which a workman seeks a legal

remedy is respect of termination of his services, and the procedure followed by a Labour

Tribunal when it determines an application made to it by a workman. Views to this effect

were expressed by G.P.S. De Silva J, as he then was, in Ceylon Tobacco Co. Ltd vs.

Illangasinghe [1986 1 SLR 1 at p.4-5] and by Tilakawardane J in Tri-Star Apparels

Exports (Pvt) Ltd vs. Gajanayake [at p.13-14]. Thus, if there is a material disparity or

divergence between the aforesaid criteria in the other legal remedy sought by the

workman and in his subsequent application to the Labour Tribunal, the second limb of

section 31B (5) cannot be applied. An attempt to apply the second section 31B (5) even

where there is a material disparity or divergence of the nature referred to in the preceding

sentence, will require unduly stretching the intended effect of the second limb of section

31B (5) beyond its proper scope, and, also, be illogical and inequitable.

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 31

Further, as I mentioned earlier, Labour Tribunals were introduced by the Legislature

with the intention of providing a special forum in which a workman, who was aggrieved

by the termination of his services by his employer, could seek relief or redress with relative

ease of procedure. Consequently, enlarging the scope of the second limb of section 31B

(5) beyond its necessary limits which were formulated in the preceding paragraphs, will

run contrary to that intention of the Legislature.

An examination of the previous decisions on the effect of section 31B (5), endorses

the conclusions reached above. Firstly, I will consider the decisions cited by learned

Presidents Counsel for the workman-appellant and learned counsel for the Employer-

Respondent, in the course of their submissions to us. The decisions cited by learned

counsel are: Richard Pieris and Co. Ltd. vs. Wijesiriwardena [62 NLR 233], The United

Engineering Workers Union vs. Devanayagam, Mendis vs. RVDB [80 CLW 49], Ceylon

Tobacco Co. Ltd vs. Illangasinghe, Construction Liason Ltd vs. Fernando [1988 II CALR

122], Independent Newspapers Ltd vs. Commercial and Industrial Workers Union

[1997 3 SLR 197] and Fernando vs. Standard Chartered Bank [2011 BALR 242].

In the Richard Pieris and Co. Ltd. case, T.S. Fernando J was of the view that the

phrase any other legal remedy in section 31B (5) refers to an action under the common

law or to recourse to a specific statutory procedure in order to claim monies or benefits

which are due to the workman from his employer upon the termination of employment.

In Devanayagams case, it is clear that Lord Guest and Lord Devlin considered that the

phrase any other legal remedy in the first limb of section 31B (5) refers to an action filed

in a civil court under the common law. That view was shared by Viscount Dilhorne, who,

referring to the phrase any other legal remedy in section 31B (5), said [at p.301] that a

workman who makes an application to a Labour Tribunal

will get what the Tribunal thinks just and equitable and he can apply even

when there has been no breach of contract. If he sues in the Courts he will have

to show that he has a cause of action and he can only get what is legally due to

him.

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 31

Viscount Dilhorne also made it clear that section 31B (5) will apply only where there

is a duplication of claims by a workman.

The same approach will apply to the second limb of section 31B (5); in Mendis vs.

RVDB, De Kretser J considered that the second limb of section 31B (5) could be applied

only where the other legal remedy sought previously by the workman was in connection

with the same subject-matter of the workmans subsequent application to the Labour

Tribunal; in the Ceylon Tobacco Co. Ltd case, which concerned a previous application

made by the workman under the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special

Provisions) Act and a subsequent application made by him to the Labour Tribunal, G.P.S.

De Silva J, when His Lordship was in the Court of Appeal, based his decision that the

second limb of section 31B (5) applies, on the fact that the jurisdiction and powers to

grant relief conferred upon Commissioner of Labour by the Termination of Employment

of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act and the jurisdiction and powers to grant relief

conferred on a Labour Tribunal by Part IVA of the Industrial Disputed Act are very similar

and, further, that the procedure before both fora were similar. It is also evident that De

Silva J considered that the phrase other legal remedy in the second limb of section 31B

(5) referred to either an action filed in a civil court under the common law or to a recourse

to a specific statutory procedure; the Construction Liason Ltd case concerned similar

facts and the Court of Appeal followed its previous decision in the Ceylon Tobacco Co.

Ltd case; the Independent Newspapers Ltd case also concerned proceedings under the

provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act and a

subsequent application by the workman to a Labour Tribunal. Dheeraratne J held that the

second limb of section 31B (5) was inapplicable because the application under the

Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act had been made by the

employer and not by the workman; the main questions before the Supreme Court in

Fernando vs. Standard Chartered Bank dealt with whether the pleadings complied with

provisions of the Civil Procedure Code. In any event, there was no application made by

the workman to the Labour Tribunal. Accordingly, this decision is of little relevance to the

issue of law which is before us in this appeal.

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 31

In addition to the above cases cited by learned counsel, the following decisions

should also be considered: Tri-Star Apparels Exports (Pvt) Ltd vs. Gajanayake, Sri

Lanka State Plantations Corporation vs. Dharmawansa, Ceylon Estate Staff Union

vs. The Superintendent, Sunderland Estate [2012 BALR 9] and Colombo Muncipal

Council Employees Co-Operative Thrift and Savings Society vs. Hettiarachchi [SC

Appeal No. 136/2009 decided on 25th June 2012]. I have not been able to locate any other

decisions which consider section 31B (5).

In the Tri-Star Apparels Exports (Pvt) Ltd case, the workman had instituted an

action in the District Court praying for relief in respect of the termination of his services

and, later, made an application to the Labour Tribunal. Tilakawardane J held that, in the

circumstances of that case, the second limb of section 31B (5) was inapplicable. Her

Ladyship held that the second limb of section 31B (5) could be invoked only where the

application to the Labour Tribunal relates to the same matter which was the subject

matter of the action instituted in the District Court [emphasis added by me]. Further, the

learned Judge was of the view that section 31B (5) could not be applied if there was

difference between the sphere or scope of the other remedy sought by the workman

and his application to the Labour Tribunal. Tilakawardane J was of the view that section

31B (5) cannot be applied if there is a difference between the principles which would be

applied by a court or other forum when deciding whether a workman is entitled to a legal

remedy which the workman has sought from that forum in respect of the termination of

his services, and the principles that would be applied by a Labour Tribunal when it decided

a workmans application. The learned judge considered that a significant difference

between the procedure followed by a court or other forum when deciding a legal

remedy in respect of the termination of a workmans services and the procedure followed

by a Labour Tribunal when it decides a workmans application, would deter the

applicability of section 31B (5). Finally, Tilakawardane J recognised that a Court or

Tribunal should be reluctant to apply the provisions of section 31B (5) in a way which will

unreasonably deprive the workman of the procedural as well as the substantive

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 31

advantages and the right to seek equitable relief granted to him by the Industrial

Disputes Act.

In the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation case, Sisira De Abrew J, when His

Lordship was in the Court of Appeal, held that a previous application made by the

workman to the Court of Appeal for the issue of a writ, cannot sustain an objection, under

section 31B (5), to the workman maintaining a subsequent application to the Labour

Tribunal, because the application for a writ is to be decided upon the principles of

administrative law while the application to the Labour Tribunal will be decided upon the

principles of equity.. His Lordship stated [at p.349]

.. I hold that seeking a remedy under the Administrative Law does not prevent

an employee from seeking relief under the Industrial Disputes Act. and I am of

the view that the provisions of section 31B (5) of the Industrial Disputes Act does

not operate, in the circumstances of this case, as a bar to the maintainability of

the case filed in the Labour Tribunal..

Thus, it is clear that Sisira De Abrew J was of the view that a difference between the

principles applied by a forum from which the workman has sought a remedy and the

principles which will be applied by a Labour Tribunal, will exclude the application of

section 31B (5).

Finally, in the Colombo Muncipal Council Employees Co-Operative Thrift and

Savings Society case, Bandaranayake CJ was of the view that section 31B (5) could apply

only if the other remedy sought by the workman and his application to the Labour

Tribunal are in respect of the same matter or substantially the same matter.

I should also mention here that, although the report of the decision in Ceylon

Estate Staff Union vs. The Superintendent, Sunderland Estate contains a statement [at

p.10] that S. 31B (5) requires the Tribunal to lay by cases filed before it, if proceedings are

being taken in another forum regarding the same matter, a perusal of the judgment shows

that the learned judge was considering how a Labour Tribunal should act when there was

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 31

a pending prosecution of the workman in the Magistrates Court for an offence which was

related to the termination of the workmans employment. That fact and the reference to

the Labour Tribunal being required to lay by the application made to it, leads me to

think that there is a typographical error in the report and that the learned judge was, in

fact, referring to section 31B (3) (b) which requires a Labour Tribunal to suspend hearing

an application made to it where the facts affecting that application are facts which affect

any other proceeding under any other law. For those reasons, I am not inclined to rely on

the report of the decision in Ceylon Estate Staff Union vs. The Superintendent,

Sunderland Estate when determining the issue of law before us.

I have taken some pains to refer to all these decisions in order to explain why I said

earlier that these decisions fortify the conclusion I reached with regard to the limitations

on the circumstances in which the second limb of section 31B (5) can be properly invoked.

Thus, if I am to reiterate the conclusion reached earlier, which, as seen from the preceding

discussion, is endorsed by the reasoning applied in several previous decisions, the criteria

upon which the second limb of section 31B (5) can be properly applied are that: (i) the

action/application by the workman in the court or other forum must cover the same or

similar ground as the application to the Labour Tribunal and have the same or similar

scope; (ii) the action/application by the workman in the court or other forum should seek

the same or similar substantive reliefs as the application to the Labour Tribunal; (iii) both

the action/application by the workman in the other forum and the workmans application

to the Labour Tribunal should be decided upon the core issue of whether the termination

of the workmans services by the employer was done for good cause, according to the

principles which are to be applied by the court or other forum; and (iv) there should not

be a significant disparity between the procedure followed by the court or other forum

and the procedure followed by a Labour Tribunal.

In my view, the second limb of section 31B (5) can be applied only if all these four

criteria or, at least, a sufficient number of them are met, so as to satisfy the Labour Tribunal

that there is no material disparity or divergence between the previous action/application

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 31

made by the workman to a court of other forum and the subsequent application made

by the same workman to the Labor Tribunal.

I should mention here that, while the first limb of section 31B (5) expressly states

that it will apply to debar the workman from being entitled to a legal remedy from another

forum only where a Labour Tribunal had previously determined an application he had

made to it, the second limb of section 31B (5) says that where a workman has first

resorted to any other legal remedy in respect of the termination of his services, he shall

not be entitled to make an application on the same subject matter to a Labour Tribunal.

The phrase first resorted to has not been defined in the Act. There has been a difference

of opinion on what is meant by the phrase first resorted to in the second limb of section

31B (5). Hence, before parting with the scope and effect of section 31B (5), the following

question should be examined: namely, whether the phrase in the second limb of section

31B (5) which states that where a workman has first resorted to any other legal remedy,

he shall not thereafter be entitled to make an application to a Labour Tribunal, has the

effect of denying a workman the right to maintain an application to a Labour Tribunal

only where he has received a determination from the court or other forum in which he has

previously filed an action/application in respect of the termination of his services; or,

whether second limb of section 31B (5) has the effect of denying a workman the right to

maintain an application to a Labour Tribunal immediately upon the workman commencing

proceedings in a court or forum other than a Labour Tribunal, despite him not having

received a determination from that court or other forum.

In this regard, in Mendis vs. RVDB, which was a decision of this Court, the workman

had instituted an action in the District Court against his employer, seeking reliefs in

respect of the termination of his services. The workman later made an application to the

Labour Tribunal. The employer objected, under the second limb of section 31B (5), to the

workman maintaining the application to the Labour Tribunal. De Kretser J held that the

second limb of section 31B (5) applies to debar an application to a Labour Tribunal only

where there has been a final determination of the other legal remedy previously sought

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 23 of 31

by the workman from the court. His Lordship was of the view that the words resorted to

used in the second limb of section 31B (5) should be interpreted to mean the obtaining

of a conclusive determination by the court and not merely the institution of an action in

court.

However, in the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in Ceylon Tobacco

Co. Ltd vs. Illangasinghe, De Silva J stated [at p. 5-6] that he was unable to agree with

the view taken in Mendis vs. RVDB. His Lordship was of the view that the words resorted

to should be given their ordinary meaning and be held to mean the act of commencing

the other proceeding.

Thereafter, in Independent Newspapers Ltd vs. Commercial and Industrial

Workers Union, which is a decision of this Court, Dheeraratne J did not refer to either

Mendis vs. RVDB or Ceylon Tobacco Co. Ltd vs. Illangasinghe. His Lordship was of the

view [at p.199] that the word resorted in the second limb of section 31B (5) should be

given the ordinary meanings of that word and be taken to mean the commencement of

proceedings in another forum and not the obtaining of a determination from that other

forum. However, as mentioned earlier, Dheeraratne Js decision in Independent

Newspapers Ltd vs. Commercial and Industrial Workers Union was grounded on the

learned Judges determination [at p.199] that the workman had not first resorted to a

legal remedy within the meaning of subsection 31B (5). Thus, Justice DheeraratneJs

aforesaid observation on the meaning of the word resorted in the second limb of section

31B (5), was made obiter.

With the greatest respect to the decision of the Court of Appeal in the Ceylon

Tobacco Co. Ltd case and to the aforesaid obiter observation by Dheeraratne J in this

Court in the Independent Newspapers Ltd case, I am unable to agree with the view that

the words first resorted to any other legal remedy in the second limb of section 31B (5)

mean the mere commencement of proceedings in another forum.

Instead, I am of the view that: (i) in the absence of a definition in the Act of the

phrase where he has first resorted to any other legal remedy or any of its component

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 24 of 31

parts; and (ii) upon an application of the established rule of statutory interpretation cited

earlier; the phrase where he has first resorted to any other legal remedy, the workman

shall not be thereafter entitled to make an application to a Labour Tribunal, in the second

limb of section 31B (5), should be understood to have a meaning and effect which is on

the same lines, mutatis mutandis, as the comparable phrase in the first limb of section

31B (5). As seen earlier, the first limb of section 31B (5) states that, where a workman has

made an application to a Labour Tribunal and proceedings thereon are taken and

concluded, the workman to whom the application relates shall not be entitled to any other

legal remedy in respect of the matter to which that application relates. [emphasis added

by me].

I see no logical reason which persuades me to think that the Legislature intended

to apply one standard in the first limb of section 31B (5) and limit the curtailment of a

workmans right to maintain an action/application for a remedy in another forum only to

instances where he has previously had an application to a Labour Tribunal finally

determined by the Labour Tribunal; and to apply another and much harsher standard in

the second limb of section 31B (5) and curtail a workman the right to maintain an

application to a Labour Tribunal merely because has had previously commenced

proceedings, in another forum but has not yet received a determination from that other

forum. In this connection, I do not think it can be reasonably said that a workman who

chooses not to avail himself of the procedure available under Part IVA of the Act in the

first instance, but later realises that he should resort to the provisions of Part IVA of the

Act, should be penalised by debarring him from doing so unless he has received a

determination from that other forum. I would add that debarring a workman from having

access to a Labour Tribunal merely because he has, perhaps misguidedly, previously

decided to refer his claim to another forum but has not received a determination from

that forum, would go against the clear intention of the Legislature when it introduced

Labour Tribunals in 1957.

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 25 of 31

Further, it has to be kept in mind that the ordinary meaning of the word resort in

this context is defined in the SHORTER OXFORD DICTIONARY [5th ed. 2 at p.2550] as

meaning Have recourse to something for aid, assistance, or as the means to an end, while

the word remedy in this context is defined [at p.2526] as meaning Legal redress. Thus,

it can be cogently contended that the ordinary meaning of the phrase where he has first

resorted to any other legal remedy in the second limb of section 31B (5), is having

obtained a determination from the other forum with regard to the legal redress [legal

remedy] sought from it.

Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the words where he has first resorted to any

other legal remedy in the second limb of section 31B (5) should be understood in a

manner comparable to the import of the first limb of section 31B (5) - ie: as meaning,

having first resorted to a legal remedy in a court or forum other than a Labour Tribunal

and having had the proceedings thereon taken and concluded by that court or other

forum. Thus, I am in respectful agreement with De Kretser J, when His Lordship stated in

Mendis vs. RVDB stated [at p.50] It appears to me it is not the filing of the plaint or the

application as the case may be that is the bar but the fact that there has been a final order

or an adjudication on the remedy sought that operates as the bar to the seeking of another

remedy in the same or any other forum. What is forbidden is the obtaining of more than

one remedy in connection with the same subject-matter in separate proceedings and not

the seeking of them.

It should be mentioned here that the decision in the Ceylon Tobacco Co. Ltd case

is by the Court of Appeal and the aforesaid observation by Dheeraratne J in this Court in

the Independent Newspapers Ltd case was made obiter. Thus, I would observe, with

respect, that neither decision stands in the way of the view as set out by me in the

preceding paragraph, which is fortified by the authority of the decision of this Court in

Mendis vs. RVDB.

When the second limb of section 31B (5) is understood, as set out above, to mean

that it debars a workman from obtaining a determination from a court or other forum of

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 26 of 31

an action or application in which he sought relief or redress from that court or other forum

in respect of the termination of his services, and, thereafter, maintaining an application in

a Labour Tribunal upon the same subject matter, it is self-evident that the second limb of

section 31B (1) is founded on the principle of res judicate, as observed by S.R. De Silva [at

p.345]. That is, in addition to the fact that the second limb of section 31B (5) had been

designed to help maintain and promote industrial peace, as described earlier.

In this connection, although both the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and

the learned High Court Judge correctly stated that the second limb of section 31B (5) is

founded on the principle of res judicata, they, nevertheless, proceeded to dismiss the

workman-appellants application to the Labour Tribunal on the ground that he had

previously filed a fundamental rights application in this Court despite the fact that this

Court had not determined that fundamental rights application. When they did so, both

the learned President and the learned High Court Judge erred by overlooking the basic

requirement that the principle of res judicata can operate only where a court or other

body lawfully vested with the authority to determine a question has pronounced a final

determination of that question, which is later made the subject matter of a subsequent

proceeding in a court or other forum. It is self-evident that, when the principle of res

judicata is to be applied to the second limb of section 31B (5), it will require that the

words first resorted to any other legal remedy in the second limb of section 31B (5) are

taken to have the meaning and effect I have described in preceding paragraphs.

To conclude this aspect of the present judgment, it is my view that, in instances

where an employer objects, under the second limb of section 31B (5), to a workman

maintaining an application to a Labour Tribunal on the ground that the same workman

has previously sought a legal remedy in a court or other forum and it is apparent that the

workman has not yet received a determination from that court or other forum, the Labour

Tribunal should examine whether the four criteria identified earlier, are met.

If the Labour Tribunal is of the view that these criteria are not sufficiently met and,

therefore, there is a material disparity or divergence between the previous

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 27 of 31

action/application made by the workman to a court or other forum and the subsequent

application made by the same workman to it, the Labour Tribunal should proceed to hear

and determine the application made to it; unless the Labour Tribunal is, nevertheless, of

the opinion that the facts affecting the application made to it are facts affecting the other

proceeding and, therefore, this is a suitable case to act under and in terms of 31B (3) (b)

and suspend hearing the workmans application until the conclusion of the proceedings

in the court or other forum and, thereafter, resume hearing the application and, when

determining the application have regard to the determination reached in the other

proceedings.

However, if the Labour Tribunal is satisfied that the aforesaid criteria are sufficiently

met and that the proceedings in the court or other forum are still pending without a

determination having being made by that court or other forum, the Labour Tribunal

should suspend hearing the workmans application until a final determination is made in

those proceedings. If a final determination is made by the court or other forum in those

proceedings, the Labour Tribunal is entitled to act under the second limb of section 31B

(5) and terminate the application made to it since it is satisfied that the aforesaid criteria

have been sufficiently met [ie: that there is no material disparity or divergence between

the previous action/application made by the workman to a court or other forum and his

subsequent application which is before the Labour Tribunal] and a final determination has

now been made in that other proceeding. However, if the other proceedings end without

a final determination being made, the Labour Tribunal should resume hearing the

application made to it. In my view, the provisions in the second limb of section 31B (5)

read with 31B (3) (b) give sufficient authority to the Labour Tribunal to act in this manner.

Further, this approach would be consistent with the principle of res judicata which is

inherent in the second limb of section 31B (5).

It remains for me apply the criteria discussed earlier and determine whether the

workman-appellants fundamental rights application no. 395/2013 in this Court enabled

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 28 of 31

the application of the second limb of section 31B (5) and the dismissal of the workman-

appellants subsequent application to the Labour Tribunal

In this regard, firstly, it is apparent that the fundamental rights application and the

application to the Labour Tribunal do not cover the same or similar ground and do not

have the same or similar scope. The fundamental rights application is founded on the

workman-appellants grievance that the employer-respondent [which is said to be an

organ or entity of the State] has violated his fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles

12 (1), 12 (2) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution. When determining a fundamental rights

application, this Court focuses on its duty to protect fundamental rights guaranteed by

the Constitution. The question before the Supreme Court is a matter of public law and its

duty to uphold constitutional rights of persons, vis--vis the State. As was emphasised by

Sharvananda J in Palihawadana v Attorney General [(1978) SLR Vol. 1 Page 65] the

object of the Fundamental Rights Chapter

Is to ensure the inviolability of certain basic rights by the state and its organs and

to establish a society founded on principles of justice, equality and freedom.

In contrast, the application to the Labour Tribunal is founded and confined within

the employer-employee relationship and the Labour Tribunal will focus on the nature of

the specific employer-employee relationship before it and ascertain whether the

termination of services was just and equitable. It is a matter of private law. It is apt here

to cite Chief Justice Sharvanandas observation [FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN SRI LANKA 1st

ed. at p.15] that An ordinary legal right appertains to private law and denotes the

relationship between two private persons; a fundamental right appertains to public law and

is a right which an individual possesses against the State itself. I should also mention that

in Gamaethige vs. Siriwardene [1988 II CALR 62 at p. 73] Fernando J observed that the

exercise of the Supreme Courts fundamental rights jurisdiction cannot be equated to the

prerogative writs. This statement highlights the even wider gulf between the nature of a

fundamental rights application and an application to a Labour Tribunal. In view of these

essential differences, it cannot be said that the workman-appellants fundamental rights

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 29 of 31

application and his application to the Labour Tribunal cover same or similar ground and

have the same or similar scope.

Secondly, it appears that the Employee-Appellants fundamental rights application

and his application to the Labour Tribunal sought similar substantive reliefs.

Thirdly, the Employee-Appellants fundamental rights application is decided by this

Court by examining, inter alia, whether he has been subjected to unequal treatment or

been denied the equal protection of the law or been made the victim of unreasonable or

arbitrary or mala fide action on the part of the employer-respondent [which is said to be

an organ or entity of the State]. The termination of the workman-appellants services is

only a part of the issue before the Supreme Court and is looked at by this Court in the

context of the questions described in the preceding sentence. On the other hand, the

application to the Labour Tribunal will be decided solely on the core issue of whether the

termination of services was just and equitable. No doubt, Article 126 (4) of the

Constitution invests the Supreme Court with the power to grant relief which it deems just

and equitable in the exercise of its fundamental rights jurisdiction. But that is only a

consequential power which can be exercised, if the Supreme Courts deems fit, when

granting relief. It is not the basis on which the Supreme Court will determine a

fundamental rights application. Thus, it cannot be said that the core issue before the

Supreme Court in the workman-appellants fundamental rights application, was the

termination of his services.

Fourthly, there is a significant disparity between the procedure followed by this

Court in entertaining and determining the workman-appellants fundamental rights

application and the procedure followed by a Labour Tribunal when determining the

application made to it by the Employee-Appellant. The fundamental rights application will

proceed to a full hearing only if the Employee-Appellant is first able to make out a prima

facie case that his fundamental rights have been violated by the Employer-Respondent

and is granted Leave to Proceed with the fundamental rights application. The decision by

this Court on whether or not to issue notice on the Employer-Respondent and whether

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 30 of 31

or not to grant Leave to Proceed, is taken based on affidavits, documents and

submissions. In contrast, a Labour Tribunal is obliged to proceed to hear and determine

the workman-appellants application made to it and there is no provision for a Labour

Tribunal to refuse to hear and determine that application [subject to any dismissal which

may be made, after hearing both parties, on a preliminary issue of law]. Even if the

Supreme Court grants Leave to Proceed and grants a full hearing of the fundamental

rights application, the Court will determine the application based on affidavits, documents

and submissions. In contrast, a Labour Tribunal will determine the application made to it,

on the basis of the oral evidence of witnesses, including cross-examination, documents

and submissions. Thus, it cannot be said that there is any similarity between the procedure

which will be followed by the Supreme Court when it determines the Employee-

Appellants fundamental rights application and the procedure which will be followed by

the Labour Tribunal when it proceeds to determine the Employee-Appellants application.

It is also pertinent to note that Fundamental Rights enshrined in Chapter III of the

Constitution can only be restricted by the limitations imposed by the Constitution itself

and cannot be limited by any other law. Thus, provisions in the Industrial Disputes Act

cannot circumscribe the scope and applicability of fundamental rights guaranteed by the

Constitution. Moreover, the ability to invoke the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction of this

Court is a distinct right vested in every person under Article 17 of the Constitution and

such right cannot be circumscribed by a restrictive reading of the Industrial Disputes Act.

For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that a Fundamental Rights

application and an application to a Labour Tribunal cannot relate to the same matter.

Hence, I am of the opinion that a workman who has invoked the Fundamental Rights

jurisdiction of this Court will not automatically be debarred from seeking relief in a Labour

Tribunal by virtue of Section 31B (5). I hold that the Learned High Court Judge has erred

in dismissing the Employee Appellants Labour Tribunal application on the ground that

the Employee Appellant has simultaneously resorted to invoke the Fundamental Rights

Jurisdiction of this Court. In my view, the correct course of action would have been for the

SC Appeal 228/2017 JUDGMENT Page 31 of 31

Labour Tribunal to suspend its proceedings until the conclusion of proceedings in the

Supreme Court under Section 31 B (3) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, and, thereafter,

resume hearing the application and, when making a final determination of the application,

have regard to the outcome of the fundamental rights application. For the

aforementioned reasons, I answer the three issues of law framed on behalf of the

appellant in the affirmative and I set aside the decision of the Labour Tribunal and the

judgment of the High Court dismissing the Employee - Appellants application and direct

the Labour Tribunal to rehear the application made by the Employee Appellant.
