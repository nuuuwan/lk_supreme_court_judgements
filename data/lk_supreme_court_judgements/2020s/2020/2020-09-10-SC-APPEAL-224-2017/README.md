This is an appeal filed against the judgment of the Provincial High Court dated

30.03.2017.

Yahampath Arachchilage Niroshanee Nadumali i.e. Plaintiff Respondent

Respondent- Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Plaintiff

Respondent) instituted the above action bearing No. 15884/15/MS under Chapter LIII

of the Civil Procedure Code against the Defendant- Petitioner-Petitioner- Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as Defendant Appellant) praying for a judgment

and decree in favour of the Plaintiff Respondent to recover a sum of Rs. 3,000,000/-

(Rs. Three Million) together with the interest as prayed for in the prayer to the Plaint

dated 09th November 2015.

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 15

Plaintiff-Respondent contended that the Defendant- Appellant borrowed the

sum of Rs. 3,000,000/- from the Plaintiff-Respondent and had given her a promissory

note which was marked as P1 in the Plaint as proof of the transaction. The

Defendant- Appellant failed to settle the said Rs. 3,000,000/- as agreed upon.

Therefore, this action was instituted in the District Court based on the said

promissory note under chapter LIII of the Civil Procedure Code to recover the same,

with interest as prayed for in the prayer to the Plaint.

The Plaintiff Respondent supported the case before the learned District

Judge on 17/11/2015 and having been satisfied the Learned District Judge directed

that summons be issued on the Defendant- Appellant as per form 19 in the 1st

Schedule to the Civil Procedure Code. The Defendant- Appellant having received

summons appeared in Court and filed objections on 29/03/2016 supported by an

Affidavit together with the annexures marked as V1,V1(A), V1(AA), V2, V3 and

V4 seeking permission from court to appear and defend the action.

The Defendant-Appellant in his statement of objections stated inter alia that,

the plaint of the Plaintiff-Respondent is not supported by an accompanying affidavit

as required by law in terms of Section 705(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Further, the

Defendant-Appellant stated that, the date of the Plaint is 09/11/2015 but the date of

the affidavit of the Plaintiff-Respondent, available in the case record and served on

the Defendant-Appellant is dated 20/11/2015, and therefore the affidavit has been

tendered to Court after filing and supporting the Plaint. In response to the claim of

the Plaintiff Respondent, the Defendant-Appellant alleged that on three separate

occasions he had paid back a total of Rs. One Million (Rs. 1,000,000/-) to the Plaintiff

Respondent and the Plaintiff Respondent had acknowledged these payments by

signing on photocopies of the promissory note (marked as V2, V3 and V4). The

contention of the Defendant-Appellant is that, the Plaintiff Respondent has

suppressed these material facts relevant to the transaction between the Plaintiff

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 15

Respondent and the Defendant-Appellant, and claimed the full amount namely Rs.

3,000,000/- from the Defendant-Appellant.

The Defendant-Appellant pleaded and moved Court to allow him to file

answer to the Plaint of the Plaintiff Respondent unconditionally in terms of the

provisions of sections 704 and 706 of the Civil Procedure Code, since the Plaint is

contrary to mandatory provisions of Section 705(1) of the Civil Procedure Code and

the Defendant-Appellant has already paid Rs. 1,000,000/- to the Plaintiff

Respondent which has been acknowledged by the Plaintiff Respondent and as such

the Plaintiff Respondent is not entitled to file action under Chapter LIII of the Civil

Procedure Code. Further, the Defendant-Appellant stated that he had obtained the

sum of Rs. 3,000,000/- from the Plaintiff-Respondents husbands friend who is a

money lender, and placed as security a property belonging to the Plaintiff-

Respondent hence the said promissory note was given as security to the Plaintiff-

Respondent.

After hearing both parties, the learned Judge of the District Court by his order

dated 13/01/2017 directed the Defendant-Appellant to deposit the sum of Rs.

3,000,000/- before filing answer. The reasons for the order of the learned District

Judge are as follows.

The English translation of the aforementioned reasoning of the District Court

judgment is as follows;

Since the Defendant himself has admitted in his affidavit and also in the

document marked as P1 that he borrowed an amount of Rs.30 Lakhs from the

Plaintiff, the position that the Defendant asserts on two occasions over the

aforesaid amount of Rs.30 Lakhs seem to be contradictory. Therefore, it is

confirmed that the said amount of Rs.30 Lakhs which is in dispute has been

given to the Defendant by the Plaintiff as a debt

Accordingly, it is the observation of this court that the contradictions of the

aforesaid defence have not been sufficient to reject or dismiss the case filed by

the plaintiff.

Therefore, I do hereby order that, if the defendant intends to submit a defence

he believes and to file an answer, he should deposit a cash bail of Rs.30 Lakhs in

the Court prior to that. (sic)

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Judge of the District Court,

the Defendant- Appellant filed a Revision application in the Provincial High Court of

the Western Province (exercising Civil Appellate jurisdiction) holden at Avissawella

(hereinafter referred to as the Provincial High Court) bearing No.

WP/HCCA/AV/11/2017 (Revision) to revise the order of the District Court.

When the matter was taken up for support, the Plaintiff Respondent raised

preliminary objections as to the maintainability of the application, as follows.

1. Since the Defendant-Appellant failed to explain the reason as to why he

could not exercise the right to appeal, the application in revision cannot be

maintained.

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 15

2. The delay to make the instant application in revision has not been

explained in the petition.

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent and the Defendant-

Appellant made submissions pertaining to the aforesaid preliminary legal objections.

Provincial High Court held that,

under section 754(2) and 757 of the Civil Procedure Code, the Defendant-

Appellant must come to the Provincial High Court against the impugned order,

upon a leave to appeal application, whereas the Defendant-Appellant has not

availed himself of these provisions of law. In such a situation, there is a duty cast

upon the Defendant- Appellant to explain the reasons as to why he did not

invoke the Appellate jurisdiction of the Court.

In this case, there is a right of appeal against the impugned order of the District

Court, with the leave of the Provincial High Court. The Defendant-Appellant,

however, has not exercised this right and failed to explain the reason as to why

he could not exercise the right of appeal. Hence, in the light of the forgoing

decisions of apex courts, Provincial High Court hold that the instant application

in revision cannot be maintained.

Besides, since there is no material prejudice caused to the defendant due to the

fact that the affidavit was executed on a subsequent date of the plaint, I hold

that there is no any impediment for plaintiff to proceed with this case as it is

instituted.

In the circumstances, it appears to this court that the order of the learned

District Judge allowing the defendant to file an answer after depositing the

entire amount in suit is not wrong.

The learned Judges of the Provincial High Court delivered the judgment dated

30.03.2017 and dismissed the said application of the Defendant- Appellant based on

the first preliminary objection raised by the Plaintiff Respondent.

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 15

Being aggrieved by the judgment of the learned Judges of the Provincial High

Court, the Defendant- Appellant filed an application before this Court seeking leave

to appeal. This matter was supported and leave to appeal was granted on

16/11/2017 on the questions of law raised in Paragraph 20(a) to (c) of the Petition

dated 06/04/2017. They are as follows.

(a) Did the Learned Provincial High Court Judges err in law by not considering

that a plaint presented under chapter LIII of the Civil Procedure Code must

accompany an Affidavit of the Plaintiff-Respondent at the time of

presenting the Plaint?

(b) Did the Learned Provincial High Court Judges err in law by not considering

that the Court has no jurisdiction to issue summons in terms of Section

705 of the Civil Procedure Code if there is no proper affidavit filed by the

Plaintiff-Respondent?

(c) Did the Learned Provincial High Court Judges err in law in coming to a

conclusion that irrespective of the imperative provisions of the Section

705(1) of the Civil Procedure Code an Affidavit can be executed before or

after the Plaint?

This matter was argued before this Court and Plaintiff Respondent

submitted that she filed her affidavit along with the petition on 09th of November

2015.

The Defendant-Appellant stated that the jurat of the Plaintiff Respondents

Affidavit filed before the District Court depicts the date of affirmation as 2015

20 ... [on the date of 20th November 2015]. It was the

position of the Defendant-Appellant that the 1st journal entry of the District Court

case record does not reveal that the Affidavit was tendered when the Plaintiff

Respondent filed this action under Chapter LIII of the Civil Procedure Code on

09/11/2015.

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 15

In this context, I have perused the original brief of the District Court, and I

observed that the impugned affidavit was filed in record on 9/11/2015. Further, I

found that the same dated Rubber Stamp was placed on the Plaint, Affidavit and

documents marked 1, 2, 2() .

As I observed, in terms of Section 705(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, when a

person (plaintiff) claims under Chapter LIII, he/she should file an affidavit along with

the petition stating the sum which he/she claims is justly due to him from the other

party (defendant). At this stage it will be useful to refer to the relevant section of the

Civil Procedure Code. Section 705(1) reads as follows;

"The plaintiff who so sues and obtains such summons as aforesaid must on

presenting the plaint produce to the Court the instrument on which he sues, and

he must make affidavit that the sum which he claims is justly due to him from

the defendant thereon."

According to Section 705(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, the condition

precedent to the issue of summons is that the documents on which the action is

based must along with the presenting the plaint, be produced to the court and that

the Plaintiff must make an affidavit that the sum which he/she claims is justly due to

him/her from the Defendant. When this section is carefully analyzed, it becomes

evident that the averments contained in the affidavit should only be supportive of

the contents of the petition.

In Kobbekaduwa vs. Jayewardene and others [1983 1 SLR 419], in the

Supreme Court, the Respondents have taken several preliminary objections to the

petition and have moved that the petition be rejected or dismissed. The petitioner

has not filed affidavits in support of his allegation of the illegal practice set out in

paragraph 7 of the petition and that the /petition accordingly does not comply with

the requirements of section 96(d) of the Presidential Elections Act, No.15 of 1981.

Justice Sharvananda observed that,

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 15

The function of an affidavit is to verify the facts alleged in the petition. The

affidavit furnishes prima facie evidence of the facts deposed to in the affidavit.

In an affidavit a person can depose only to facts to which he is able to testify of

his knowledge and observation.

In Kumarasinghe vs. Ratnakumara and Others [1983 SLR - Vol 2 ,Page 393]

at the commencement of the hearing of that application before the Supreme Court, a

preliminary objection had been raised by the Addl. Solicitor-General that the

petitioner's application does not conform to the requirements of Rule 65(1) of the

Supreme Court Rules of 1978; in that, the petition of the petitioner has not been

supported by an affidavit of the petitioner. He had pointed out that though the

affidavits of petitioner's brother Rajasinghe Bandara and his mother Manoli

Dharmadasa had been appended to the petition, the petitioner had failed to file his

own affidavit verifying the facts pleaded by him in his petition. He had contended

that it is an imperative requirement of the Rule 65(1) (a) and (c), that the petitioner

should support his petition with his own affidavit. In that backdrop, Justice

Sharvananda, A.C.J.,held as follows;

An Affidavit in support of the application serves the purpose of proof of facts

stated therein. It furnishes the evidence verifying the allegation of facts

contained in the petition. Affidavit evidence carries equal sanctity as oral

evidence. While a stranger cannot make an affidavit, it need not be made by the

party individually, but may be made by any person personally aware of the

facts.

In Distilleries Company Ltd vs. Kariyawasam and others (2001 SLR - Vol 3,

Page 119), the matter had been taken up for hearing on the 25th June 2001 before

the Court of Appeal and counsel for the plaintiff respondent (respondent) had raised

two preliminary objections. His first objection had been based on the provision of

section 757(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Counsel had submitted that the affidavit

filed by the 16th Defendant-petitioner (petitioner) does not support the petition as

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 15

contemplated by section 757(1) of the Civil Procedure Code, as the affidavit had been

affirmed to on a date anterior to the date the petition had been subscribed to. It had

been argued on behalf of the respondent, that as the date of the affidavit submitted

by the petitioner precedes the date of the petition, the petitioner could not have

possibly supported the contents of the petition by his affidavit, as contemplated by

section 757(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Justice Nanayakkara held as follows;

In terms of S. 757(1), the Petition need not precede in point of time to that of

the affidavit so as to enable a party to support the contents of the Petition. The

object of the Civil Procedure Code is to prevent civil proceedings from being

frustrated by any kind of technical irregularity or lapse which has not caused

prejudice or harm to a party. A rigid adherence to technicalities should not

prevent a court from dispensing justice." The court should not approach the task

of interpretation of a provision of law with excessive formalities and technicality.

A provision of law has to be interpreted contextually giving consideration to the

spirit of the law".

In the case of Mohamed Facy Mohamed vs. Mohamed Azath Sanoon Sally

and others [SC Appeal 4/2004 BASL Law Journal 2006 page 58] his Lordship Justice

Marsoof in considering the impact of defects of technical nature of an affidavit, has

observed in reference to Section 9 of the Oaths Ordinance, that the said section is a

salutary provision which was intended to remedy such maladies.

In conclusion, it must be said that the infirmities and irregularities in the

affidavit of the Plaintiff- Respondent referred to by the Defendant- Appellant are

technical in nature, and that they can be cured by application of section 9 of the

Oaths Ordinance and therefore do not impact on the validity of the affidavit.

I am of the opinion that the object of the Civil Procedure Code is to regulate

the conduct of civil proceedings and prevent civil procedure from being frustrated by

any kind of technical irregularity or lapse which has not caused no prejudice or harm

to a party. Hence, all that is expected of a person under section 705(1) of the Civil

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 15

Procedure Code is to evidentially support matters contained in the petition by way of

an affidavit. A rigid adherence to technicalities should not prevent a Court from

dispensing justice. In the instant case, the learned District Judge has given his

reasons for not allowing the Defendant- Appellant to defend the action

unconditionally. On a perusal of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, it is clear

that the legislature had intended to give the Judge in every such case the discretion

as to imposing terms with which the Appeal Court should not unnecessarily interfere.

In the aforesaid circumstances, I hold that the cited irregularity is not

sufficiently grave to have an effect on the validity of the impugned affidavit. Hence, I

answer the first question of law in the negative.

On a careful consideration of Sections 704(2) and 706 of the Civil Procedure

Code, it appears that when the Defendant who swears to a fact which, if true,

constitutes a good defence, he/she must be allowed to defend unconditionally

unless there is something on the face of the proceedings which lead the Court to

doubt the bona fides of the Defendant. It should be mentioned here that the

provision contained in section 704(2) of the Civil Procedure Code should not be

made use of as a punishment for not honouring ones obligation and the words

unless the court thinks his defence not to be prima facie sustainable or feels

reasonable doubt as to his good faith mean that the learned trial Judge has the

discretion to decide the question whether the Defendant should be allowed to

appear and defend without security. When one considers the above facts, it is clear

that the defence has not raised a triable issue and in such an event leave must not be

given unconditionally.

In the instant case, the Defendant-Appellant had presented different defences

and statements during the course of the trial. Hence, the learned District Judge has

exercised his discretion on sound judicial grounds, and on a perusal of the reasons

given by the learned District Judge, one cannot say that he has exercised his

discretion arbitrarily or perversely. In terms of Section 706 of the Civil Procedure

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 15

Code, having deposited the amount stipulated in the order of the learned District

Judge, the Defendant- Appellant has a legal right and opportunity to present all his

defences by way of an answer for final adjudication. He has failed to do so.

The power of revision vested in the Appellate Court are very wide; such

powers would only be exercised in exceptional circumstances. When there is an

alternative remedy available to the Defendant- Appellant or if the law provides

opportunities for the Defendant- Appellant to put forward his grievances, ordinarily

the Court will not interfere by way of revision.

In Rasheed Ali V. Mohamed Ali and Others (1981 SLR Vol 1 ,Page 262) the

Supreme Court observed that, ordinarily the Court will not interfere by way of review,

particularly when the law has expressly given an. aggrieved party an alternate remedy

such as the right to file a separate action, except when non-interference will cause a

denial of justice or irremediable harm.

It was submitted by the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff- Respondent that the

date that appears in the jurat is due to a typographical error. It is pertinent at this

stage to consider Section 9 of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance, No. 9 of 1985,

which provides as follows:

Proceedings and evidence not to be invalidated by omission of oath or

irregularity.

No omission to take any oath or make any affirmation, no substitution of any

one for any other of them, and no irregularity whatever in the form in

which any one of them is administered, shall invalidate any proceeding

or render inadmissible any evidence whatever in or in respect of which such

omission, substitution, or irregularity took place, or shall affect the obligation of

a witness to state the truth.

(Emphasis added)

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 15

Section 13 of the Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance furnishes the sanction

against a false affidavit by making the deponent guilty of the offence of giving false

evidence. In an affidavit a person can depose only to facts which he is able of his own

knowledge and observation to testify.

Taking the abovementioned law into consideration, I find that Section 9 makes

provision for an omission due to inadvertence, evasion or irregularity which took

place on the part of a declarant to be cured. This contention was upheld in K.H.S.

Pushpadeva vs. Senok Trade Combine Ltd [SC/HC/LA 02/2014 decided on

04/09/2014- Bar Association Law Journal 2015 Vol. XXI page 40]. When this case was

taken up for support, counsel for the Applicant-Appellant- Respondent had raised

preliminary objections and stated that the affidavit of Jerome Anil Rathnayake, is not

an affidavit known to law, as there was no affirmation. It had also been formulated

as a mere statement and the affirmant has not specified his religion and had not

taken an oath or affirmation. Justice Aluwihare, PC held that,

In conclusion it must be said that the infirmities and irregularities in the

affidavit of the Petitioner referred to by the Respondent are technical in nature

that can be cured by application of Section 9 of the Oaths Ordinance and

therefore do not impact on the validity of the affidavit.

I find that it is not disputed that the aforementioned decision has referred to

technicalities and had held that merely on the footing of a technical objection a

party should not be deprived of his case being heard by Court. I am quite mindful of

the fact that mere technicalities should not be thrown in the way of the

administration of justice and accordingly I am in respectful agreement with the

observations made by Justice Dr. Amarasinghe in Fernando v. Sybil Fernando and

Others - (1997) 3 Sri L.R. 1) in which he held that;

"Judges do not blindly devote themselves to procedures or ruthlessly

sacrifice litigants to technicality.

SC APPEAL 224/2017 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 15

(Emphasis added)

Hence, I answer the second and third questions of law also in the negative.

Additionally, since there is no material prejudice caused to the Defendant-

Appellant due to the fact that the affidavit was executed on a subsequent date of the

plaint, I hold that there is no impediment for the Plaintiff-Respondent to proceed

with this case in the manner it has been instituted. For the aforesaid reasons, I answer

all the questions of law raised before this Court by the Respondent- Appellant in the

negative, and I dismiss the appeal of the Respondent- Appellant. Accordingly, I affirm

the Order of the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court dated 30.03.2017 and

the learned Judge of the District Court dated 13.01.2017. I dismiss the appeal with

costs fixed at Rs.50, 000/-.

Appeal dismissed.
