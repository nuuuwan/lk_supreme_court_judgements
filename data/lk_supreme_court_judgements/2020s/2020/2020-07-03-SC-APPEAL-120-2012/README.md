Decided on: 3.7.2020 Sisira J. de Abrew, J The Plaintiff-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Appellant Bank) granted overdraft facilities (hereinafter referred to as

O/D facilities) to the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-Respondent). The said O/D facilities

were granted by the Nugegoda Branch of the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank to the

Defendant-Respondent who maintained a current account in the Nugegoda

Branch of the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank. The Plaintiff-Appellant Bank instituted

action No.4329/03/M in the District Court of Mount Lavinia against the

Defendant-Respondent to recover a sum of Rs.1,232,642.57 and 24% interest

per annum with effect from 1.8.1999 on the basis of the said O/D facilities

granted to the Defendant-Respondent. The learned District Judge by his

judgment dated 30.7.2008 dismissed the action of the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank

on the basis that the action was prescribed. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment of the learned District Judge, the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank appealed to

the Civil Appellate High Court. The Civil Appellate High Court by its judgment

dated 19.3.2012 dismissed the appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank and

affirmed the judgment of the learned District Judge. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank has

appealed to this court. This court by its order dated 6.7.2012, granted leave to

appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs 11(a),(b),(c),(d) and (e) of the

Petition of Appeal dated 26.6.2012 which are reproduced below.

SC Appeal 120/2012

1. When money is lent by way of an overdraft, when does prescription begin

to run if there is a stipulation that overdraft is repayable on demand?

2. When there is an overdraft facility which does not stipulate repayment on

demand and the customer makes a deposit (repayment) in reduction of the

overdraft, when does prescription begin to run for the purpose of the

Prescription Ordinance No.22 of 1871 as amended?

3. Where there is an overdraft facility which does not stipulate repayment on

demand and the bank makes a last advance to the customer by way of an

overdraft and the outstanding balance after the said last advance remains

unpaid, when does prescription begin to run?

4. Where there is an overdraft facility which does not stipulate repayment on

demand and there is a written acknowledgement and/or promise of

liability incurred under the overdraft facility, when does prescription

begin to run for the purpose of the Prescription Ordinance?

5. Where there is an overdraft facility which does not stipulate repayment on

demand and there is a written acknowledgement and/or promise of

liability in relation to the overdraft, what would be the period of

prescription?

The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court too decided that the action

of the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank had been prescribed on the basis of Section 7 of

the Prescription Ordinance which reads as follows.

No action shall be maintainable for the recovery of any movable property, rent,

or mesne profit, or for any money lent without written security, or for any money

paid or expended by the plaintiff on account of the defendant, or for money

SC Appeal 120/2012

received by defendant for the use of the plaintiff, or for money due upon an

account stated, or upon any unwritten promise, contract, bargain, or agreement,

unless such action shall be-commenced within three years from the time after

the cause of action shall have arisen.

One of the factors that the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

considered to arrive at the said conclusion was the date of default of payment by

the Defendant-Respondent which was on 1.8.1999. The action was filed on

19.12.2003. They came to the above conclusion on the basis of letter marked P7

sent by the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank to the Defendant-Respondent. Although the

learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court came to the above conclusion,

the statement of account regarding the current account of the Defendant-

Respondent marked P6 indicates that the Defendant-Respondent has made

payments in the months of May to December 2000, May, July to November

2001, August and September 2002. P6 further indicates that as a result of these

payments over draft balance has been reduced. Thus, the above conclusion

reached by the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court regarding the

date of default of payment by the Defendant-Respondent (1.8.1999) is wrong.

Learned counsel for the Defendant-Respondent tried to contend that the account

of the Defendant-Respondent had lain dormant from year 1999 to 2003 and that

therefore the action of the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank has been prescribed. He

cited a passage from the book titled Law of Contract by Prof. Weeramanthry

1st Edition Vol. II page 874 which reads as follows.

Overdrafts are loan by the banker to the customer, and in general no

demand is necessary, so that the time runs against the banker in respect

of each overdraft from the time when it is made. A bank cannot therefore

SC Appeal 120/2012

recover against a customer on an overdraft which has lain dormant for

the prescriptive period which, in Ceylon in the absence of a written

contract, would be three years.

I now advert to this contention. Has the account of the Defendant-Respondent

lain dormant? As I pointed out earlier, the Defendant-Respondent has made

payments to his account in the years 2000,2001 and 2002. Therefore, it is clear

that the account of the Defendant-Respondent has not lain dormant. For the

above reasons, I reject the above contention of learned counsel for the

Defendant-Respondent.

The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court have, in order to arrive at

the conclusion that the action of the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank was prescribed,

considered the judgment in the case of Seylan Bank Limited Vs Intertrade

Garments (Private) Limited 2004 BLR Vol. II page 41 wherein Justice Dr.

Shirani Bandaranayake held as follows.

In an action concerning a loan repayable on demand, the cause of

action will arise only at the time when demand is made. An action for the

recovery of money lent without written security, must be commenced

within three years from the time after the cause of action had arisen.

At this stage it is necessary to consider whether the money obtained by the

Defendant-Respondent on an O/D facilities is a loan or not.

The amount of money given by a bank to its customer on O/D facilities is

money belongs to the bank and the customer is duty bound to repay the said

amount. Therefore, the money given by a bank to its customer is a loan. This

view is supported by the following legal literature.

SC Appeal 120/2012

Prof. Weeramanthry in his book titled Law of Contract 1st Edition Vol. II page

874 which states as follows.

Overdrafts are loan by the banker to the customer. .

In the case of Hatton National Bank Vs Helenluc Garments Ltd [1999] 2 SLR

365 Justice Wijetunga held as follows.

Overdrafts are loans by the banker to the customer, and in general no

demand is necessary, so that time runs against the banker in respect of

each overdraft from the time when it is made.

In Elingers Modern Banking in Law 5th Edition page 756 states as follows.

From a legal point of view, an overdraft is a loan granted by the bank to

the customer so that the bank is the creditor and the customer is the

debtor

Considering all the above matters, I hold that an overdraft granted by a bank to a

customer is a loan.

Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake in the case of Seylan Bank Limited Vs

Intertrade Garments (Private) Limited (supra) observed that in an action

concerning a loan repayable on demand, the cause of action will arise only at the

time when demand is made. An action for the recovery of money lent without

written security, must be commenced within three years from the time after the

cause of action had arisen. I have earlier held that an overdraft granted by a

bank to a customer is a loan. Thus, acting on the principles laid down in the

above judicial decision, I hold that in an action to recover an overdraft granted

by a bank to a customer, cause of action would arise at the time the demand was

SC Appeal 120/2012

8

made. In the present case the demand to repay the overdraft was made to the

Defendant-Respondent on 26.9.2003 by letter marked P7. Thus, the cause of

action in the present case has arisen only on 26.9.2003. The action in the present

case was filed on 19.12.2003. Thus, the action has been filed within three years

from the date of the cause of action arose. For the above reasons, I hold that the

action of the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank has not been prescribed. Therefore, I hold

that the learned District Judge and the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate

High Court were wrong when they came to the conclusion that the action of the

Plaintiff-Appellant Bank had been prescribed. Further I would like to point out

that when the letter of demand marked P7 dated 26.9.2013 was sent to the

Defendant-Respondent, the Chairman of Defendant-Respondent by letter dated

5.12.2003 marked P8, has stated that the overdraft granted to the Defendant-

Respondent could be settled. Thus, even on the basis of letter marked P8 it can

be said that the action of the Plaintiff-Appellant Bank had not been prescribed

when the action was filed.

For the above reasons, I answer the 1st question of law as follows.

In the present case, prescription begins to run from the date of the demand.

In view of the answer given to the1st question of law it is not necessary to

answer the 2nd and the 4th questions of law.

The 3rd and 5th questions of law do not arise for consideration.

For the aforementioned reasons, I set aside both judgments of the District Court

and the Civil Appellate High Court. The Plaintiff-Appellant Bank has, by way of

evidence, proved its case and is entitled to the relief claimed in the plaint. I

therefore grant relief claimed in the plaint. The learned District Judge is directed

to enter decree in accordance with this judgment. The Plaintiff-Appellant Bank

is entitled to costs in all three courts.

Appeal allowed.
