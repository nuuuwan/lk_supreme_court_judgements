Background of the Case

Petitioners version

The Petitioner is a day labourer working at Fractures Ayurvedhic Dispensary in

Hettipola and a former army soldier. The Respondents to this application are the

Officer-in-Charge (OIC), Hettipola; OIC Crimes of Police, Hettipola; the Inspector

General of Police and the Attorney General (described nomine officii). In his affidavit,

the Petitioner has referred to Police Officer Saman and Sub-Inspector of Police (SI)

Sumanaweera as the persons who violated his rights. Inspector of Police (IP)

Samansiri, in his affidavit, has identified himself as the OIC of Hettipola and as the 1st

Respondent. SI Sumanaweera has also filed an affidavit identifying himself as the OIC

Crime of Hettipola and as the 2nd Respondent.

The Petitioner claims that he was arrested on the 13th of December 2013 at

around 3.00 pm. The Petitioner further states that, at the time of his arrest, he had

not been informed of the reason for his arrest. The Petitioner submits that he was

repeatedly assaulted whilst in police custody by the 1st Respondent, IP Samansiri

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as 1R) and the 2nd Respondent, SI Sumanaweera

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as 2R) from the 13th to the 15th of December 2013.

The Petitioner states that he was produced before the District Medical Officer

(DMO) of Hettipola on the 15th of December and to the Magistrate on the 16th of

December 2013. The Police moved the Magistrate to handover the suspect to

Kobeigane Army Camp. On the Magistrates orders, the Petitioner had been

remanded till the 24th of December 2013. On the 24th of December 2013, the

Petitioners mother produced the letter of discharge from service from the Sri Lankan

army to the Magistrate. The Police had objected to bail being granted and the

Learned Magistrate had ordered the prison officers to handover the Petitioner to the

Boyagane military police. Although the Petitioner had been handed over to the

military police on the 28th of December 2013, he had been permitted to leave as he

no longer belonged to the Army.

SC / FR 296/14 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 12

The Petitioner states that he was admitted to Chilaw Hospital on the 31st of

December 2013 as he was critically sick and that he was discharged from hospital on

the 3rd of January 2014. He had complained about the assault to the DIG Kurunegala

on the 7th of January 2014 and to the Human Rights Commission on the 16th of

January 2014 (HRC 2012/2014). The Petitioner then sought the relief of the Supreme

Court as no inquiry was held by the Human Rights Commission despite the lapse of

10 months since the complaint was made.

Respondents Version

Both the 1st and 2nd Respondents claim that the Petitioner was arrested on the

15th of December 2013 at around 2.05 pm at the Galkanda Junction after having

explained the charges against him. Respondents refute the claim that the arrest was

unlawful and state that that the arrest was carried out based on the results of the

preliminary investigation carried out by the Hettipola Police on a complaint made by

Mohamed Rasiduge Mohamed Jaleel regarding theft of a mobile phone.

Respondents also claim that the Petitioner is an army deserter attached to the 6th

Vijayaba Regiment of the Sri Lankan Army.

Before proceeding to deal with the alleged infringement of Fundamental

Rights guaranteed to the Petitioner under the Constitution of Sri Lanka, it is pertinent

to reminisce the observations of Justice Prasanna Jayawardena in Ajith Perera v.

Daya Gamage et al. [SC FR Application No. 273/2018 at page 23] (decided on 18th

April 2019)

it seems to me that the concept of human dignity, which is the entitlement of

every human being, is at the core of the fundamental rights enshrined in our

Constitution. It is a fountainhead from which these fundamental rights spring

forth and array themselves in the Constitution, for the protection of all the

people of the country.

SC / FR 296/14 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 12

I am in respectful agreement with his Lordship that Human Dignity is a

constitutional value that underpins the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction of the

Supreme Court. I am of the view that Human Dignity as a normative value should

buttress and inform our decisions on Fundamental Rights. Hence, it is with this value

in mind, that the allegations against the Respondents and State are examined.

Article 13 of the Constitution guarantees to every person inter alia freedom

from arbitrary arrest, detention and punishment. Article 13(1) guarantees that;

No person shall be arrested except according to procedure established by law.

Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest.

Article 13(2) provides that;

Every person held in custody, detained or otherwise deprived of personal liberty

shall be brought before the judge of the nearest competent court according to

procedure established by law and shall not be further held in custody, detained

or deprived of personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of such

judge made in accordance with procedure established by law.

There seems to be a discrepancy in the Petitioners and Respondents as

regards the time of the arrest. The Petitioner claims that he was arrested on the 13th

of December 2013, kept in custody and assaulted till the 15th of December 2013.

However, the Respondents claim that the Petitioner was arrested on the 15th of

December 2013 at 2.05 pm. If the Respondents account that the Petitioner was

arrested on the 15th of December 2013 is true, then it seems to appear that the

Respondents have obtained a Medico-Legal Examination Form (MLEF) by producing

the Petitioner to a Medical Officer within half an hour of the time of the arrest (i.e. on

the 15th of December 2013 at 2.32 pm). Although the Respondents claim that the

Petitioner was produced for an examination as he appeared to be under the

influence of liquor, the MLEF relied on by the Respondents reveals that the reason for

examination was to check whether the Petitioner has any injuries on his body. There

SC / FR 296/14 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 12

is no mention of whether the Petitioner resisted arrest or whether any violence or

escape was involved. In brief, there is no material submitted to Court which reveals

that the Petitioner had sustained injuries at the time of the arrest. If the Petitioner

was arrested on the 15th of December 2013 as claimed by the Respondents, then the

Respondents have not satisfactory explained as to why the Petitioner was produced

before a Medical Officer immediately after the arrest to check for injuries. Under

these circumstances, an inference can be drawn that the Petitioner was arrested not

as claimed by the Respondent but as described by the Petitioner. Having found the

Petitioners claim that he was arrested on the 13th of December 2013 to be credible, I

find that the detention of the Petitioner from the 13th to the 16th of December 2013

without producing him before a Magistrate to be unlawful and hence violation of

Article 13(2) of the Constitution.

The reasons for arrest submitted by the Respondents are theft and desertion

of the army. It is a proven fact that the Petitioner was serving in the Army and that he

was duly discharged from the service. As per the material submitted to Court, a

statement from the Petitioner and all necessary evidence relating to the charge of

theft of a mobile phone (value is not mentioned) had been obtained by the Police by

the 16th of December 2013. Hence, there appears to be no valid reason for the Police

to object to bail being granted. The objections raised by the Police for bail being

granted to the Petitioner for the bailable offence of theft of a mobile phone, leads

me to the inference that the arrest was illegal. In view of the aforementioned

circumstances, I find the arrest to be improper, unlawful and a violation of the

Petitioners rights enshrined under Article 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution.

The Petitioner submits that at the time of his arrest, he had not been informed

of the reason for his arrest. The Respondents claim that he was arrested after having

explained the charges against him. Given the paucity of evidence, no finding is made

in this regard.

SC / FR 296/14 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 12

Article 11 of the Constitution guarantees that no person shall be subjected to

torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is an

unqualified, non-derogable right to which every person is entitled. The unqualified

nature of the right together with the fact that it is an entrenched provision make it

abundantly clear that the Constitution envisages zero tolerance towards cruel,

inhuman or degrading treatment which is the anti-thesis of Human Dignity.

The Petitioner submits that on the 13th of December 2013, 1R and 2R

assaulted him with a 2 feet long iron bar. He submits that his head was injured and

that he was bleeding. When he requested for treatment, the police officer had merely

thrown water at him and locked him up.

The Petitioner claims that he was assaulted again on the following day i.e. on

the 14th of December 2013. He had been asked to remove his clothes and 1R and 2R

had proceeded to assault him with their hands and PVC pipes. The Petitioners hands

and thumbs had been tied backwards and he had been lifted up with the rope sent

over a beam and hung from the rafter. 1R had pulled on the rope from time to time

and the Petitioner claims that he was in terrible pain. The Petitioner submits that he

was assaulted six times on the 14th of December 2013.

The Petitioner submits that he was assaulted once again on the 15th of

December 2013 with the PVC pipes whilst he lay on the floor. The Petitioner claims

that he was kept in a seating position and that 2R and 1R had given forceful blows to

the soles of his feet with a wooden stick.

When investigating allegations of custodial violence inflicted by the Police, it is

relevant to keep in mind the inherent difficulties in proving the allegations.

First, a victim or a witness able to corroborate his story might hesitate to

describe or reveal all that has happened to him for fear of reprisals upon himself

or his family. Secondly, acts of torture or ill-treatment by agents of the Police or

Armed Services would be carried out as far as possible without witnesses and

SC / FR 296/14 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 12

perhaps without the knowledge of higher authority. Thirdly, allegations of

torture or ill-treatment are made the authorities whether the Police or Armed

Services or the Ministers concerned must inevitably feel that they have a

collective reputation to defend, a feeling which would be all the stronger in

those authorities that had no knowledge of the activities of the agents against

whom the allegations are made. In consequence there may be reluctance of

higher authority to admit or allow inquiries to be made into facts which might

show that the allegations are true. Lastly, traces of torture or ill-treatment may

with lapse of time become unrecognizable, even by Medical Experts, particularly

where the form of torture itself leaves few external marks. [Jayampathy

Wickramaratne, FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN SRI LANKA (2nd edn, Stamford

Lake Publication 2006) at p 219 citing Greek Case, Journal of Universal

Human Rights, [1979] 1, No 4, 42)

The Respondents have denied the allegations of torture leveled against them.

The Respondents claim that an internal investigation was carried out based on the

complaint made by the Petitioner and that 2nd Respondent has been discharged of

all allegations leveled against him. I am in agreement with Atukorale Js observations

with Sharavanada CJ and LH de Alwis J agreeing in Sudath Silva v. Kodithuwakku

[(1978) 2 Sri LR 119 at page 126 -127]

The police force, being an organ of the State, is enjoined by the Constitution to

secure and advance this right and not to deny, abridge or restrict the same in any

manner and under any circumstances It is the duty of this court to protect and defend

this right jealously to its fullest measure with a view to ensuring that this right which is

declared and intended to be fundamental is always kept fundamental This court

cannot, in the discharge of its constitutional duty, countenance any attempt by

any police officer however high or low, to cancel or distort the truth induced,

perhaps, by a false sense of police solidarity.

(Emphasis mine)

SC / FR 296/14 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 12

The Petitioner claims that when he was produced before the Medical Officer

on the 15th of December 2013, the Respondents had threatened him preventing him

from disclosing any information about the assault. Thereafter, the Petitioner had

been produced to the Magistrate on a Saturday and he had not been allowed to talk.

Petitioner was enlarged on bail and freed from police and fiscal custody on the 28th

of December 2013. On the 31st of December 2013, the Petitioner got himself

admitted to the District General Hospital of Chilaw, where he had the freedom to

speak to the Doctors and the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO). The Medical Legal

Report (MLR) of the JMO of Chilaw states the following as the Short History given by

the Patient:

While I was returning home in the evening from the working place I saw a sim

card on a roadside culvert. I put it in my phone with the intention to find the

owner and return. I called to a person named Weeraman. After one week,

Police came and arrested me. I was in their custody from 13/12/2013 to

16/12/2013. They physically harassed me. They hit me six times a day. They

removed my clothes, tied my hands on my back and lifted up with a rope sent

over the beam. They kept me in seated position and gave forceful blows to my

soles with a wooden stick. They hit my face with a fisted hand. They also hit me

with a rubber hose.

The Report reveals that the Petitioner had two injuries caused by a blunt

weapon, i.e. 1) parallel healed linear abrasions 5cm in length and 2 cm apart on the

left side of the back, directed downwards and laterally, 8cm below the inferior angle

of the scapula; 2) tenderness over buttocks, deltoid and anterior thigh area. After a

thorough examination, the consultant JMO Chilaw had come to the conclusion that

injuries that I could notice are compatible with the history given by the patient

and commented that since the Petitioner was presented to the JMO two weeks after

the date of the incident, some of the injuries could have disappeared by the time of

the examination. Given the fact that the Petitioner was hospitalized from the 31st of

SC / FR 296/14 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 12

December 2013 to the 3rd of January 2014 and in light of the conclusion reached by

the independent Government Judicial Medical Officer, I find the Petitioners claims to

be sufficiently corroborated.

In view of the above circumstances, I find that the Petitioners fundamental

right under Article 11 has been violated by the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

It should perhaps be mentioned in passing that gross humiliation or driving

an individual to act against his will or conscience may be deemed to amount to

degrading treatment [Jayamapthi Wickramaratne in FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN SRI

LANKA (2nd edition, Stamford Lake Publications 2006) at page 208 - 209 quoting

from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands v. Greece (1969) 12 YBECHR 1

and Tyrer v. The United Kingdom (1978) 17 YBECHR 356)]. The Petitioner claims that

on the day of the arrest (i.e. the 13th of December 2013) although the Petitioner had

been willing to come to the Police Station on his own motorbike, he had been

handcuffed, dragged and forced to sit on the police motorbike and taken to the

police station. It is pertinent to note here that if the Petitioners claim is true, the

manner in which the arrest was carried out can be said to be degrading and hence a

violation of Article 11. However, given the lack of evidence to support the Petitioners

claim, no finding is made as regards the manner of arrest.

In view of the violation of the Petitioners rights under Articles 11 and 13, I

find that the Respondents and the State have violated the Petitioners right to equal

protection of the law guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Responsibility of the State

The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading

Treatment of Punishment (10 December 1984, United Nations, Treaty Series, vol.

1465, p. 85,) has been ratified by Sri Lanka and incorporated into domestic law by

SC / FR 296/14 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 12

The Convention Against Torture Act No 22 of 1994. Section 12 of the Act defines

Torture as,

Torture with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means any

act which causes severe pain, whether physical or mental, to any other person,

being an act which is-

(a) Done for any of the following purposes that is to say

(i) Obtaining from such other person or a third person any information

or confession; or

(ii) Punishing such other person for any act which he or a third person

has committed, or is suspected of having committed; or

(iii) Intimidating or co-ercing such other person or a third person; or

(b) Done for any reason based on discrimination.

And being in every case, an act which is done by, or at the very instigation of, or

with the consent or acquiescence of, a public officer or other person acting in an

official capacity.

Given the circumstances, it is evident that the Petitioner has been subject to

torture within the meaning of the aforementioned definition. The consistent pattern

of police violence, custodial torture and death as evidenced by the considerable

number of Fundamental Rights petitions filed before this Court, indicates that the

State should consider addressing and mitigating the problem. Article 10 of the

Convention which requires the State to ensure that education and information

regarding the prohibition against torture are fully included in the training of

law enforcement personnel, civil or military, medical personnel, public officials

and other persons who may be involved in the custody, interrogation or

treatment of any individual subjected to any form of arrest, detention or

imprisonment may provide a starting point. As a society that is committed to

protecting the Dignity and Well-being of the People (See the Preamble/ Svasti of

the Constitution), the violation of the right to liberty guaranteed by Articles 11 and

SC / FR 296/14 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 12

13 of the Constitution should be of serious concern and in my view, the State should

take more proactive steps to address the gap between the law and practice.

Considering all material available before this Court, I am of the view that the

Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution, particularly Articles 11, 12(1),

13(1) and 13(2) have been violated by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents. I specifically

find the 1st and 2nd Respondents individually liable for the violation and I direct them

to pay Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand) each as compensation from their

personal resources to the Petitioner.

I find the State to be liable as the Respondents have acted as agents of the

State. Hence, I order the State to pay Rs. 100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousand)

as compensation to the Petitioner from funds of the Police Department.

Application allowed.
