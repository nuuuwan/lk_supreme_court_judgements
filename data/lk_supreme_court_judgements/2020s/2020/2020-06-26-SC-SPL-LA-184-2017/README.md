Aluwihare PC. J.,

In supporting this Special Leave to Appeal application, the learned President’s Counsel on

behalf of the Accused-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter the Petitioner) submitted to the court

that among other matters, he is relying mainly on two issues;

(1) Has the manner in which this matter was dealt with by the Court of Appeal created

a reasonable doubt as to whether the Petitioner had had the benefit of the

consideration of his appeal by one of the two judges who had heard the appeal, in

as much as the judgement had been delivered without jurisdiction?

(Cumulatively, questions of law raised in sub-paragraphs a. and b. of Paragraph

20 of the Petition.)

(2) Did the Court of Appeal misdirect itself by not considering or by having

overlooked, the version of the Petitioner placed before the court in arriving at its

conclusions? (Cumulatively, questions of law raised in sub-paragraphs, c. d. and

e. of paragraph 20 of the Petition of the petitioner.)

This court having considered the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner, is of the view

that there is merit in the matters urged before us. Accordingly, Special leave to appeal is

granted on the questions of law (1) and (2) referred to above.

As the learned Counsel representing the parties have consented for the court to act under the

proviso to Rule 16(1) of the Supreme Court Rules 1990, this court would proceed to

determine the above two issues forthwith, dispensing with compliance with the provisions of

the said Rules in regard to the steps preparatory to hearing of this appeal.

With regard to the first question of law referred to above, it was the contention of the learned

President’s Counsel that this matter was argued in the Court of Appeal before Hon. Justices,

K. K. Wickramasinghe and M. M. A. Gafoor and the judgement was delivered on 07th June

2017. The judgement, however, had been delivered by Hon. Justices P. R. Walgama and K. K.

Wickramasinghe. It was pointed out that this matter was not argued before her ladyship

Justice Walgama. On the perusal of the Court of Appeal minutes, commencing from 23rd

April 2012 up to 08th June 2016, it is quite evident that Hon. Justice Walgama had not

presided over this matter. On 08th June 2016 the matter had been taken up for argument

before Hon. Justices Wickramasinghe and Gafoor. The arguments had been re-fixed, to be

resumed on 04th August 2016, on which date the arguments were concluded before the same

bench referred to above, and the judgement was reserved by Hon. Justice Wickramasinghe.

The court had ordered the parties to file written submissions. The day on which the written

4

submissions were tendered to the court, Hon. Justices Walgama and Wickramasinghe had

presided.

Hon. Justice Wickramasinghe had delivered the judgement on the 07th June 2017. Hon.

Justice Walgama, concurring with Justice Wickramasinghe, had signed the said judgement

(A6). Subsequently, however, this case had got listed again on the 17th July 2017 and had

come up before Hon. Justice Wickramasinghe. On the said date, the court observing, that

‘there is a typographical error and a genuine mistake in the judgement’, a fresh judgement

of even date signed by both Hon. Justices Wickramasinghe and Gafoor had been pronounced,

and in the same breath the judgement delivered on the 07th June 2017 had been set aside

[Court of Appeal minutes of 17/07/2017].

The learned President’s Counsel pointed out that according to the Court of Appeal minutes

aforementioned, it appears that the subsequent judgement had been referred to Hon. Justice

Gafoor for his consideration only after the second judgement was signed by him and the same

was delivered.

The last line of that minute (of 17th July 2017) reads as follows; “After realizing that it should

have been signed by H/L M. M. A Gafoor J, I send the judgement to for his consideration”.

[sic] (emphasis added)

What reflects from the above minute is that the judgement has been referred to Hon. Justice

Gafoor for his consideration, only after it was delivered for the second time. The learned

President’s Counsel submitted that if that be the case, the judgement cannot stand, as it had

not been considered by one of the two judges who heard the case.

The Court of Appeal record does not disclose when the error was detected and whether any

steps were taken consequent to the detection of the error. This court sought the assistance of

both the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned Deputy Solicitor

General in this regard. But neither Counsel could elucidate as to what transpired between

the 07th June and the 17th July 2017.

Perusal of both judgements clearly shows that it is more than a typographical error. The

caption of the judgement delivered on 07th June 2017 states that the matter was argued

“Before; P. R. Walgama, J & K. K. Wickramasinghe, J” whereas the judgment delivered on

17th July states “Before; M. M. A. Gafoor, J & K. K. Wickramasinghe, J.”

It was also pointed out by the learned President’s Counsel that the Judgment delivered by

Hon. Justices Walgama and Wickramasinghe is identical to the judgement purported to have

been delivered by Hon. Justices, Gafoor and Wickramasinghe. It was contended on behalf of

the Petitioner that substantial prejudice had been caused to him as there is a serious doubt as

5

to whether Hon. Justice Gafoor had had the opportunity to consider the judgement in draft,

prepared by Hon. Justice Wickramasinghe and to offer his opinion, before it was pronounced.

Lord Chief Justice Hewart’s remarks in the case R v. Sussex Justices ex parte McCarthy

([1924] 1 KB 256, [1923] All ER Rep 233) made almost 100 years ago, “Justice should not

only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” are now heard

throughout the common law legal regimes. They sustain, in my view, not only an ethical

requirement that judges cannot hear a case if, from the perspective of a reasonable and

informed observer, their impartiality might reasonably appear to be compromised, but

transcends to the requirement that judges must also observe procedures that are widely

regarded as fair and transparent, especially in criminal cases.

Considering the aforesaid, I am of the view that, in the interest of justice, it would not be safe

to sustain the impugned judgment.

The second matter raised before this court by the learned President’s counsel was that the

Hon. Judges of the Court of Appeal had not given any consideration whatsoever to the matters

raised on behalf of the Accused-Appellant-Petitioner before the Court of Appeal. The learned

President’s Counsel submitted that the matters raised on behalf of the Petitioner, in the course

of the oral arguments before the Court of Appeal, with regard to the three distinct counts on

which the Petitioner was indicted, are referred to in pages 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Petition of the

Petitioner filed before this court. It was also submitted that a comprehensive written

submission dated 11th November 2016, was also filed on behalf of the Petitioner. The learned

President’s Counsel contended that, from the judgement it appears that the Court of Appeal

had not considered or given its mind to any of those matters. He also pointed out that, of the

7-page judgement where the court had dealt with the issues, 3 ½ pages are a verbatim

reproduction of the written submissions filed on behalf of the Attorney General. Perusal of

the documents shows that the submission of the learned President’s Counsel is not without

merit.

As referred to earlier in this judgement, on the first question of law raised on behalf of the

Petitioner, this court is of the view that it would not be safe to sustain the judgements (dated

07th June 2017 and 17th July 2017) delivered by the Court of Appeal. As such we are of the

view that it would not be necessary to consider and make a pronouncement on the second

question of law on which Special Leave to Appeal was granted.

6

Accordingly, both judgments pronounced by the Court of Appeal (07th June 2017 and 17th

July 2017) in this matter are hereby set aside. This court further directs the Court of Appeal

to hear the arguments in this matter afresh before a bench which had not considered this

case earlier.

Appeal partially allowed, Rehearing of the appeal by the Court of Appeal ordered.
