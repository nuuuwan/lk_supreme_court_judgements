WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS : 1st – 14th and 23rd Respondents on 6th February 2020

Petitioners on 21st June 2017

DECIDED ON : 19th May 2020.

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Petitioners were attached to Sri Lanka Customs. They were all appointed

to the post of Assistant Superintendent – Grade II with effect from 1st April 1990 and

were all promoted to the post of Deputy Superintendent with effect from

25/08/2010.

The next promotion available to the Petitioners is to the post of

Superintendent of Customs. The Petitioners state that promotions to the said post

are effected solely on the basis of seniority which is ascertained at an oral interview.

The Petitioners state that this has been the practice that has consistently been

followed by the Sri Lanka Customs when selecting officers for promotion to said

post.

It is alleged that the authorities have promoted seventeen officers without

following the proper procedure. Namely, there was no proper advertisement calling

for applications and that there was no interview. Therefore their Fundamental Rights

enshrined under Article 12(1) of the Constitution had been infringed upon.

Available facts reveal that the Sri Lanka Customs had sought approval from

the Public Service Commission to fill the existing 15 vacancies. It was submitted that

the calling for applications was displayed at the Human Resources Directorate of Sri

Lanka Customs on 20/01/2016. Further, it was circulated through the Customs Union

on which the Petitioners are members. The Petitioners deny seeing such an

advertisement and receiving any information through the Customs Union. Officials

of the said union also by letter dated 22/06/2016 (R5a) confirmed that the Petitioners

SC FR 181/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 9

are their members and they were informed of the vacancies and the date and time of

the interviews.

The above proves that the notice was properly displayed and communicated

to the Petitioners.

The Counsel for Petitioners and Respondents submit that after filing this

application the Petitioner and other Officers were promoted following the due

process. Presently the grievance of the Petitioners is that their seniority be restored

by back dating their appointments over and above the Officers who were promoted

in June 2016.

I carefully perused the material before us. It appears that pursuant to Cabinet

Decision No. අමප/14/07.09/504/079 dated 11 July 2014, the Public Service

Commission had amended the Scheme of Recruitment (SOR) applicable to Sri Lanka

Customs from the original one. Accordingly, promotions to the post of

Superintendent of Customs from that of Deputy Superintendent of Customs is

granted on the basis of seniority. Officers serving as Deputy Superintendents of

Customs, have to face a formal interview prior to such promotions being effected.

The interviews are held by an interview Board approved by the Public Service

Commission and at said interview the qualifications and other details of the

candidates are verified. The interview is mainly to consider the seniority of the

applicants.

The Petitioners are presently not challenging the interviews and promotions

given in January 2016, their challenge is only on the appointment given to eight

officers in June 2016. It is observed that the Public Service Commission had approved

the promotion of fifteen people originally and another two thereafter. Subsequently,

the Sri Lanka Customs by letter dated 27/05/2016 sought approval from the Public

Service Commission through the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance to appoint eight

officers from the list of officers who had faced interviews held on the 21st of January

2016. The Public Service Commission by letter dated 23/06/2016, granted approval

SC FR 181/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 9

to make the appointments as suggested by the Sri Lanka Customs and accordingly

the eight vacancies were filled according to seniority from the list of officers who had

faced interviews on 21st January 2016. Therefore it was not necessary for the Sri

Lanka Customs to re-advertise and re- interview when there was an approval from

the Public Service Commission.

The Respondents submit that the fact that the Petitioners were not interested

in applying or obtaining the promotions is evident from the conduct of the

Petitioners. Despite promotions being given to Officers who were ranked below the

Petitioners in the list of seniority in January 2016, the Petitioners made no complaint

or appeal and only submitted a belated appeal in May 2016.

The Respondents reiterated the aforementioned fact by submitting that, it was

further confirmed by the fact that this is not the first occasion where the 1st Petitioner

failed to apply for promotion despite being eligible to apply. He failed to apply for

the interview held on 24/04/2015, despite being eligible to be promoted according

to the merit order of the seniority list applicable to the rank of Deputy

Superintendent of Customs as at 24/04/2015 (1R13), the 1st Petitioner was ranked at

No. 50. The officer ranked at No.51 in the list, applied for the promotion, attended

the interview held on the aforesaid date and was promoted to the rank of

Superintendent with effect from 14/10/2015. Hence it is evident that if the 1st

Petitioner had applied for promotion and attended the interview, he would have

been eligible to be promoted with effect from 14/10/2015

The Respondents submit that it is imperative that all officers seeking

promotions to submit an application and be present at an interview. It is admitted

fact that Petitioners have not submitted their applications for promotion. Therefore,

they are not entitled to get any promotion, despite being eligible to be promoted

based on the ranking in the seniority list.

In the case of Devasinghe v Jayaratne SC/FR 516/95 (S.C.M. dated

19/02/1997) Justice Shirani Bandaranayake, J stated as follows;

“The question that has to be considered is whether the petitioners and the

respondents were equals under the above mentioned circumstances. There

is no doubt that equals will have to be treated equally without any

discrimination. However, the equal protection of the law cannot be

postulated among unequals; people who are differently circumstanced.

While the Respondents applied for the said post, the petitioners for

reasons of their own, had decided not to apply. No one had denied

the petitioners their right to apply for the advertised positions…If the

petitioners were interested in the said post the least they could have done

was to have sent an application. Their decision not to apply for the post,

clearly shows that they were, for some reason or other not interested in the

post. The decision not to send applications was not forced on them by

anyone but was a self- imposed decision. Since the petitioners failed to

apply, I cannot see how we could treat the petitioners and respondents as

persons who belong to the same class. The Petitioners and 8th – 11th

respondents, in my opinion cannot be regarded as persons similarly

circumstanced.”

(Emphasis added)

The Petitioners allege violation of their Fundamental right guaranteed under

the constitution. Article 12(1) of the Constitution states that all persons are equal

before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. The non –

promotion of the Petitioners occurred due to them not applying for the promotion.

However I am of the view that in these circumstances there has not been a violation

of their Fundamental Rights

Considering all material available before us, I find that all steps with regard to

the promotion process have been correctly made with the approval of the Public

SC FR 181/2016 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 9

Service Commission which is the appointing authority. I find no reason to backdate

the promotions of the Petitioners due to the fact that the non - promotion of the

Petitioners in the first instance was not due to any fault of the Respondent but

instead occurred due to their failure to apply for promotion at the relevant time. I am

of the view that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners enshrined in the

Constitution, particularly Article 12(1) has not been violated.

After careful consideration I dismiss the application with cost. I fix cost at Rs.

10,000/- on each of the Petitioners.

Application dismissed.
