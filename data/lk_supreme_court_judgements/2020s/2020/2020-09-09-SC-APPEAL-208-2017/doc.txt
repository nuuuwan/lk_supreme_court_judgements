Vijithsingh for the Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellants Sudarshani Corray for the Plaintiff-Respondent- Respondent-Respondent Argued on : 21.7.2020 Written submission tendered on : 17.8.2018 by the Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellants 19.11.2018 by the Plaintiff-Respondent- Respondent-Respondent Decided on: 9.9.2020 Sisira J. de Abrew, J Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Respondent) filed this action against the 1st and the 2nd Defendant-

Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant-

Appellants) seeking a declaration, inter alia, that the Plaintiff-Respondent is the

owner of the property in question and to eject the Defendant-Appellants from

the property in question. The learned District Judge by her judgment dated

30.8.2010 held in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Being aggrieved by the

said judgment of the learned District Judge, the Defendant-Appellants filed an

appeal in the Civil Appellate High Court. The learned Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court by their judgment dated 19.4.2016 dismissed the appeal of

the Defendant-Appellants. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned

Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Defendant-Appellants have

SC Appeal 208/2017

appealed to this court. This court by its order dated 31.10.2017, granted leave to

appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs 12(i),(ii),(iii) and (iv) of the

Petition of Appeal dated 27.5.2016 which are set out below.

(i) Whether the learned High Court Judges of the Civil Appellate High

Court of Gampaha erred in law by not considering the question that

although Princy Smarawickrama did not have the title to the property

in question at the time of entering into a lease agreement, since she had

the possession of the same, she had the right to lease out the

possession of the said property to the Petitioners by Deed of Lease

bearing No. 2396 executed on 28.10.1992?

(ii) Despite the aforesaid question No. (i) Whether the learned High Court

Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Gampaha erred in law by

not considering that the lease agreement entered by Princy

Samarawickrama with the Petitioners would become effective from 28.

10.1992 for the remainder of the lease for 99 years by applying the

principle of exceptio rei vinditae et traditae or from 03.04.1997 once

Princy Smarawickrama got the title back?

(iii) Honourable High Court Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of

Gampaha erred in law by holding that after the demise of the life

interest holder Princy Samarawickrama the lease agreement would

come to an end without considering the fact that the lease agreement is

valid for 99 years and would only come to an end after the lapse of 99

years?

SC Appeal 208/2017

(iv) Whether the Honourable Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of

Gampaha erred in law in not considering the evidence placed before

them in the correct and proper perspective in all the circumstances of

this case?

It has to be noted here that the 1A Plaintiff-Respondent Manic Pura Waduge

Chureen, the 2nd Defendant-Appellant Manic Pura Hewage Seetha and Manic

Pura Hewage Anulawathi are sisters and daughters of Princy Samarawickrama.

Facts of this case may be briefly summarized as follows.

Princy Samarawickrama by Deed of Gift No. 3647 dated 3.5.1988 marked P6

gifted the property in question to her daughter Anulawathi reserving her life

interest to the property in question. However, Anulawathi by deed No.2831

dated 3.4.1997 marked P7 transferred the property in question to her mother

Princy Samarawickrama. Therefore, it is seen that during the period

commencing from 3.5.1988 to3.4.1997, the owner of the property in question

was Anulawathi and not Princy Samarawickrama. However, Princy

Samarawickrama leased the property in question to one of her daughters Manic

Pura Hewage Seetha who is the 2nd Defendant-Appellant by Lease Agreement

No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (marked V1) for a period of 99 years. Thus, when

Princy Samarawickrama executed the abovementioned Lease Agreement

No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (marked V1), she was not the owner of the property

in question but she was holding the life interest to the property in question.

However, said Princy Samarawickrama by Deed of Gift No 123 dated 2.12.1998

marked P8, gifted the property in question to one of her daughters Manic Pura

Hewage Chureen who is the 1A Plaintiff-Respondent. (However, in the caption

her name has been typed as Manic Pura Waduge Chulani). It has to be noted

SC Appeal 208/2017

6

here that when Princy Samarawickrama executed the said Deed of Gift No 123

dated 2.12.1998 marked P8, she was the owner of the property in question and

she did not retain the life interest to the property in question. Thereafter said

Manic Pura Hewage Chureen by Deed of Gift No.14523 dated 20.8.2003

marked P9 gifted the property in question to her husband Obawath

Kankanamage Jinadasa who was the original Plaintiff-Respondent in this case.

However, Princy Samarawickrama continued to occupy the property in question

even after she gifted it to her daughter Chureen.

The Plaintiff-Respondent claims the property in question on the strength of the

Deed of Gift No 123 dated 2.12.1998 marked P8 and the Deed of Gift No.14523

dated 20.8.2003 marked P9. The Defendant-Appellants claim the property in

question on the strength of Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992

(marked V1). At the time that the Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992

(marked V1) was executed Princy Samarawickrama was not the owner of the

property in question but was only holding the life interest to the property in

question. At the time of the execution of the said Lease Agreement No.2396

dated 28.10.1992, the owner of the property was Anulawathi. At the time that

the Deed of Gift No 123 dated 2.12.1998 marked P8 was executed Princy

Samarawickrama was the owner of the property in question.

The most important question that must be decided in this case is whether Lease

Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (marked V1) has been proved in court. I

now advert to this question. As I pointed out earlier, when Princy

Samarawickrama signed the Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992

(marked V1), she was not the owner of the property in question and that she was

only having the life interest to the property. Thus, Princy Samarawickrama is

SC Appeal 208/2017

7

alleged to have signed the Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (marked

V1) apparently relying on the life interest to the property. The Lease Agreement

No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (marked V1) is for a period of 99 years. Princy

Samarawickrama is a mother of at least three daughters. Her life interest to the

property in question exists only up to her death. Thus, can it be believed that she

executed a lease agreement for a period of 99 years knowing very well that she

would not live for next 99 years? Therefore, this story of 99 year lease does not

tally with the test of probability. In my view it is difficult to believe that Princy

Samarawickrama executed a Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992

(marked V1) for a period of 99 years.

The Notary Public who attested the Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992

(marked V1) is W.D. Padmasiri Perera. He, in his attestation of Lease

Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (marked V1), does not say that he knows

Princy Samarawickrama. The two attesting witnesses Weerapulige Donald

Ackmon and Abdul Carder have not given evidence. W.D. Padmasiri Perera, the

Notary Public in his evidence says that he does not know Princy

Samarawickrama personally. He further, in his evidence, says that he, in his

attestation, has not stated that he knew Princy Samarawickrama and if he knew

her, it would have been stated in the attestation. Under these circumstances the

question arises whether Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (marked

V1) has been proved. In considering this question Section 68of the Evidence

Ordinance is relevant. Section 68of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows.

“If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as

evidence until one attesting witness at least has been called for the

SC Appeal 208/2017

8

purpose of proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and

subject to the process of the court and capable of giving evidence.”

In Wijegoonetilleke Vs Wijegoonetilleke 60 NLR 560 Basnayake CJ held as

follows.

“A Notary who attests a deed is an attesting witness within the meaning of

that expression in sections 68 and 69 of the Evidence Ordinance.”

In Marian Vs Jesuthasan 59 NLR 348 Sinnetamby J held as follows.

“Where a deed executed before a notary is sought to be proved, the

Notary can be regarded as an attesting witness within the meaning of

section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance provided only that he knew the

executant personally and can testify to the fact that the signature on the

deed is the signature of the executant.”

In Wijegoonetilleke Vs Wijegoonetilleke 60 NLR 560 Basnayake CJ delivered

the judgment on 6.7.1956. In Marian Vs Jesuthasan 59 NLR 348 Sinnetamby J

delivered the judgment on 20.7.1956. Therefore, it is seen that Sinnetamby J

delivered the judgment after Basnayake CJ delivered the judgment in

Wijegoonetilleke Vs Wijegoonetilleke 60 NLR 560. I would like to follow the

judgment in the case of Marian Vs Jesuthasan (supra).

In the case of Ramen Chetty Vs Assen Najna [1909] Current Law Reports of

Ceylon 256 Hutchinson CJ and Middleton J held as follows.

“The evidence of the Notary who attested a document, to the effect that

the signatory and the witnesses signed in his presence and in the presence

of one another, is not sufficient to prove the document, where the

SC Appeal 208/2017

9

signatory was not known to the Notary. To prove a document, whether

notarially attested or otherwise, it must be proved that the signature of the

signatory is in his handwriting.”

Section 31(9) of the Notaries Ordinance reads as follows

“He shall not authenticate or attest any deed or instrument unless the

person executing the same be known to him or to at least two of the

attesting witnesses thereto ; and in the latter case, he shall satisfy himself,

before accepting them as witnesses, that they are persons of good repute

and that they are well acquainted with the executant and know his proper

name, occupation, and residence, and the witnesses shall sign a

declaration at the foot of the deed or instrument that they are well

acquainted with the executant and know his proper name, occupation, and

residence.”

Sinhala version of Section 31(9) of the Notaries Ordinance reads as follows.

Applying the principles laid down in the case of Marian Vs Jesuthasan (supra)

and Ramen Chetty Vs Assen Najna (supra), I hold that when a deed executed

SC Appeal 208/2017

10

before a Notary Public is sought to be proved in evidence, the Notary Public can

be regarded as an attesting witness within the meaning of section 68 of the

Evidence Ordinance only if the following matters are satisfied.

1. There must be evidence from the Notary Public to the effect that he knew

the executant personally at the time the executant placed his signature on

the deed OR that he (the Notary Public) knew the attesting witnesses

personally and the attesting witnesses knew the executant personally.

2. There must be evidence from the Notary Public to the effect that the

signature found in the deed is the signature of the executant.

3. There must be evidence from the Notary Public to the effect that two

attesting witnesses placed their signatures in his presence.

In the present case, although the Defendant-Appellants sought to prove the

Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (marked V1), they did not call any

of the attesting witnesses to give evidence. The Notary Public who attested the

said deed says, in his evidence, that he does not know the executant personally.

When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the Lease Agreement No.2396

dated 28.10.1992 (marked V1) has not been proved in accordance with Section

68 of the Evidence Ordinance and it cannot be used as evidence in this case.

The next question that must be considered is whether the Deed of Gift No.123

dated 2.12.1998 (P8) executed by Princy Samarawickrama has been proved or

not. I now advert to this question. The Notary Public who attested the Deed of

Gift No.123 dated 2.12.1998 is T.H.D. Upul Deshappriya. He has, in his

attestation, stated that he knows the donor Princy Samarawickrama, donee

Manic Pura Hewagw Churanee and two attesting witnesses Ranasinghe

SC Appeal 208/2017

11

Archchige Don Somapala Ranasinghe and Manic Pura Hewagw Sriyani. T.H.D.

Upul Deshappriya the Notary Public in his evidence too has stated that he knows

the donor and donee in Deed of Gift No.123 dated 2.12.1998 and that the donor,

the donee, and the two attesting witnesses placed their signatures in his

presence. Manic Pura Hewagw Sriyani, one of the attesting witnesses in Deed of

Gift No.123, in her evidence says that she is a daughter of Princy

Samarawickrama and she signed as a witness in Deed of Gift No.123 dated

2.12.1998. When I consider all the above matters, I hold that Deed of Gift

No.123 dated 2.12.1998 has been proved and it is an act and a deed of Princy

Samarawickrama. Therefore, I hold that Princy Samarawickrama has gifted the

property in question to her daughter Manic Pura Hewagw Chureen by Deed of

Gift No.123 dated 2.12.1998. When Princy Samarawickrama gifted the property

in question to her daughter Manic Pura Hewagw Chureen by Deed of Gift

No.123 dated 2.12.1998, she did not retain the life interest of the property in

question.

Manic Pura Hewagw Chureen, by Deed of Gift No.14523 dated 20.8.2003

marked P9 has gifted the property in question to her husband Obawath

Kankanamage Jinadasa who is the original Plaintiff in this case. According to

paragraph No.10 of the Answer of the Defendant-Appellant, the Deed of Gift

No.14523 dated 20.8.2003 has been challenged on the basis that Deed of Gift

No.123 dated 2.12.1998 was not an act and a deed of Princy Samarawickrama. I

have earlier held that Deed of Gift No.123 dated 2.12.1998 was an act and a

deed of Princy Samarawickrama. Thus, the Defendant-Appellant cannot

challenge the Deed of Gift No.14523 dated 20.8.2003.

SC Appeal 208/2017

12

Further, the Defendant-Appellants argue that since the life interest of the

property in question was reserved by Princy Samarawickrama when she

executed the Deed of Gift No.3647 dated 3.5.1988 (P6) giving the property in

question to her daughter Anulawathi, the life interest of the property in question

was remaining with her and that the Defendant-Appellants are entitled to the

benefit of the Deed of Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (V1) at the

time of institution of this action. This argument does not hold water since this

court holds that the said Deed of Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992

(V1) was not proved and further, no life interest of the property in question was

retained by said Princy Samarawickrama when she executed the Deed of Gift

No.123 dated 2.12.1998 (P8).

Considering all the above matters, I would like to make the following

observation. Any act performed, on the strength of life interest to a property, by

the life interest holder such as leasing of the property comes to an end with the

demise of the life interest holder or when the life interest holder renounces the

life interest to the property.

In the present case, Princy Samarawickrama by Deed of Gift No. 3647 dated

3.5.1988 gifted the property in question to her daughter Anulawathi retaining the

life interest to the property in question. Princy Samarawickrama acting on the

life interest to the property in question is alleged to have executed deed of Lease

Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 for a period of 99 years in favour of the

2nd Defendant-Appellant. Thereafter, said Anulawathi, by deed No.2831 dated

3.4.1997, transferred back the property in question to Princy Samarawickrama

and thereby she again became the owner of the property in question. Thereafter,

Princy Samarawickrama as the owner of the property in question, by Deed of

SC Appeal 208/2017

13

Gift No.123 dated 2.12.1998 gifted the property in question to her daughter

Manic Pura Hewage Chureen who is the 1A Plaintiff-Respondent without

retaining the life interest to the property in question. Thus, when Princy

Samarawickrama executed the Deed of Gift No.123 dated 2.12.1998, she has

renounced her life interest to the property in question. I have already held that it

was not proved that Princy Samarawickrama executed the deed of Lease

Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 for a period of 99 years. She has, by Deed

of Gift No 123 dated 2.12.1998, renounced her life interest to the property in

question. Since the Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 which is

alleged to have been executed by Princy Samarawickrama has not been proved,

when she signed the Deed of Gift No.123 (2.12.1998) full title goes to the donee

of Gift No.123. Thus, the Defendant-Appellants will not be entitled to the

benefit of the Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 alleged to have been

executed by Princy Samarawickrama.

Considering all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the Plaintiff-Respondent

has proved that the owner of the property in question is the Plaintiff-

Respondent.

For the above reasons, I hold that the judgment of the learned District Judge

deciding the case in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent is correct and that the

learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court were correct when they

dismissed the appeal affirming the judgment of the learned District Judge.

I have earlier held that the Lease Agreement No.2396 dated 28.10.1992 (marked

V1) has not been proved. Therefore, any rights alleged to be emanating from the

said Lease Agreement cannot be considered by courts. In view of the conclusion

reached above, I answer the above questions of law in the negative.

SC Appeal 208/2017

For the aforementioned reasons, I affirm the judgment of the learned Judges of

the Civil Appellate High Court dated 19.4.2016 and dismiss this appeal with

costs.
