S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

Yogananda Wickramasinghe Mohotti i.e. Plaintiff Respondent Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as Plaintiff Respondent) instituted action

bearing number L7623 in the District Court of Matara against Nimal Bambarenda i.e.

Defendant Appellant Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Defendant

Appellant) seeking, a declaration that the Plaintiff Respondent was the owner of the

land referred to in the schedule to the plaint, to eject the Defendant Appellant

from said land and to hand over vacant possession thereof to the Plaintiff

Respondent.

In his plaint, the Plaintiff Respondent took up the position that the

aforementioned land originally belonged to the National Housing Development

Authority and that Hewa Lunuwilage Dayananda became owner by conveyance

bearing No. 7330 dated 04/01/1991. Dayananda transferred the land to the Plaintiff

Respondent by deed No. 30121 dated 08/03/1991 attested by Jinadasa Pathirana,

Notary Public and the Plaintiff Respondent had been in undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession thereof for 10 years and also had prescriptive title. He

further stated that the Defendant Appellant was the tenant of Dayananda and

when the Plaintiff Respondent purchased the land, the Defendant Appellant

contested the Plaintiffs title and was unlawfully occupying the land and claimed title

to said land.

The Defendant Appellant filed answer maintaining, inter alia, that Hewa

Lunuwilage Dayananda and the Plaintifff Appellant had acted in collusion and had

fraudulently executed the Deed No. 30121 to defraud the Defendant Appellant

since on the 6th of September 1985, Hewa Lunuwilage Dayananda had entered into

an agreement to sell aforesaid land to the Defendant Appellant for a sum of Rs.

SC APPEAL 34/2010 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 8

80,000/- and the Defendant Appellant came into possession of the land upon

paying an advance of Rs. 24,000/-.

The case was fixed for Trial in the District Court on 11/06/1996. On this day

the Defendant did not appear and the learned District Judge entered ex-parte

judgment in favour of the Plaintiff Respondent. Thereafter the Defendant

Appellant filed papers under Section 86 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code to purge his

default. Section 86 (2) states as follows;

Where, within fourteen days of the service of the decree entered against him for

default, the defendant with notice to the plaintiff makes application to and

thereafter satisfies court, that he had reasonable grounds for such default, the

court shall set aside the judgment and decree and permit the defendant to

proceed with his defence as from the stage of default upon such terms as to

costs or otherwise as to the court shall appear proper

The Defendant Appellant stated in his petition that he worked as a motor

mechanic undertaking work in different parts of the Island, he stated that on

02/06/1996 he had undertaken the repair of a bus belonging to one Jagath

Wickramasinghe who was a resident of Dela, Maudella, Marapana in Ratnapura.

Several days thereafter, there had been heavy rains in Ratnapura and the Marapana

area suffered heavy flooding and transportation was completely halted. The

Defendant Appellant states that due to this heavy flooding he was unable to attend

court on 11/06/1996. Thereafter the matter was fixed for inquiry and the Defendant

Appellant, Jagath Wickramasinghe and Herbert Clarence Silva who was the Grama

Niladhari of Marapana, Maudella gave evidence.

By Order dated 11/12/2001 the learned District Judge after considering all

evidence before him refused the Defendants application. The Defendant appealed

against the Order of the District Court to the Provincial High Court holden at Matara.

The Appeal was argued on 02/04/2009 and the learned High Court delivered

judgment on 15/06/2009 dismissing the Defendant Appellants appeal. Being

SC APPEAL 34/2010 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 8

aggrieved with the Judgment of the High Court the Defendant Appellant preferred

an appeal to this Court.

Leave to appeal was granted on the questions of law set out in paragraph 14

of the Petition dated 27/07/2009.

There are several issues that need to be addressed with regard to this matter.

The first being that the Defendant Appellant had not provided sufficient evidence

to prove that there were floods in Ratnapura on the day of the hearing. In his

judgment the learned additional District Judge stated as follows;

Herbert Clarence Silva who was the Grama Niladhari of Marapana, Maudella also

gave evidence and in his evidence he stated that there was no flooding;

When this matter was appealed to the High Court, the learned High Court

Judge confirmed the findings of the learned District Judge that the Defendant

Appellant had failed to adduce sufficent evidence on his behalf in regards to the

floods in Ratnapura. The learned High Court Judge further observed on perusal of

the brief, that it appears that after this matter was fixed for hearing in the District

Court the Defendant Appellant obtained several dates citing various reasons. On

the eighth trial date, he had failed to appear in court and had failed to give

SC APPEAL 34/2010 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 8

instructions to his AAL. Therefore the case was decided ex-parte in favour of the

Plaintiff - Respondent. The High Court Judge gave several reasons for dismissing the

Defendant Appellants appeal. they are as follows;

a) The Defendant had failed to adduce evidence to the satisfaction of the

Court that he could not appear on the trial date due to the sudden

flooding in the area where he was residing at the time.

b) Upon the perusal of the case record, it appears that after the case was

fixed for trial, the Defendant had obtained several dates citing various

reasons and on the 8th trial date, the Defendant had failed to appear in

court and failed to give instructions to his AAL. Therefore the case was

decided ex-parte.

c) At the inquiry to set aside the ex-parte order, the Defendant did not

attempt to lead the evidence of the Grama Niladhari of the Division he

was resident at the relevant time.

d) In terms of the decision in Paramalingam v Sirisena and Another (2001)

Vol. 2 SLR 239, the law assists those who are vigilant and not those

asleep on their rights.

In Paralingam v Sirisena and Another (2001) Vol. 2 SLR Justice

Wigneswaran held as follows;

Laches means negligence or unreasonable delay in asserting or enforcing a

right. There are two equitable principles that come into play when a statute

refers to a party being guilty of laches. The first doctrine is delay defeats

equities. The second is that equity aids the vigilant and not the indolent

(Emphasis added)

Furthermore I find that the more appropriate area of law for the Defendant

Appellant would have been Section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance which states as

follows;

SC APPEAL 34/2010 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 8

The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have

happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human

conduct, and public and private business in their relation to the facts of the

particular case;

The Court may presume-

(f) That evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced, be

unfavourable to the person who withholds it;

I find that the Defendant Appellant did not provide both the District Court

and the High Court with sufficient evidence. The Newspaper articles that the

Defendant Appellant produced to this Court as evidence were not produced at the

District Court. In addition to this the bus that the Defendant Appellant repaired was

parked at Jagath Wickramasinghes brothers house which was located in

Sudugedara, Marapane in Ratnapura. The Grama Sevaka who gave evidence in the

District Court was the Grama Sevaka of the Marapana, Maudella division. The correct

Grama Sevaka division in relation to this matter is the Sudugedara Division.

In David Appuhamy v Yasassi Thero (1987 SLR 253) it was held that,

An ex- parte order made in default of appearance of a party will not be vacated

if the affected party fails to give a valid excuse for his default.

Moreover this incident occurred in 1996. When the Defendant Appellant was

unable to make his appearance in court, if he was vigilant (Vigilantibus non

dormientibus jura subveniunt) he could have used a telephone to inform his lawyer.

There is no explanation as to why he failed in doing so. Whether the flood prevented

the Defendant Appellant in coming to court is a matter of fact. The learned District

Judge who heard and observed the witnesses disbelieved the story of the Defendant

Appellant. Consequently, we are not in a position to hold otherwise.

When taking into consideration the questions of law, I find that the Judgment

of the High Court was accurate and was arrived at after taking into consideration all

SC APPEAL 34/2010 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 8

available evidence. The learned High Court Judge had reached her conclusion after

considering all material and submissions available to her and had taken into

consideration the position of both parties. Furthermore, I find that the Defendant

Appellant had failed in providing both the District Court and the High Court with the

evidence necessary to substantiate his application to purge his default. The Order of

the learned District Judge had been made after all the evidence was taken into

account. Moreover the Grama Sevaka who gave evidence was not from the right

division and there were substantial contradictions in the evidence given by the

Defendant Appellant, Jagath Wickramasinghe and Clarence Silva. For these reasons

I answer the questions of law under which leave was granted in the negative.

Taking the aforementioned into consideration I find no reason to interfere

with the judgments of the District Court and High Court. The Defendant Appellant

did not provide sufficient evidence to support his application to purge his default

under Section 86 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code. I dismiss the appeal with cost and I

fix cost at Rs. 150,000/-

Appeal dismissed.
