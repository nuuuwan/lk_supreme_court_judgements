Decided on: 11.03.2020

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants (herein after referred to as the Plaintiff-Appellants) instituted

proceedings before the District Court of Kandy against the 1st and the 2nd Defendant-Appellant-

Respondents (hereinafter referred to as 1st and the 2nd Defendant-Respondents) for declaration of

title and ejectment from the land more fully described in the schedule to the plaint.

As revealed before us, the said proceedings were commenced only against the 1st and 2nd Defendant-

Respondents but, at a later stage of the trial the 3rd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as 3rd Defendant-Respondent) too had intervened in the proceedings pending before the

District Court.

The trial before the District Court proceeded with one admission and 25 issues raised by the parties

and at the conclusion of the said trial, the learned District Judge entered the judgment in favour of

the Plaintiff-Appellants, answering issues 1-9 and 11 in favour of them.

Being dissatisfied with the said decision of the District Court, the 1st and the 2nd Defendant-

Respondents appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of the Central Province, holden in Kandy. By

Judgment dated 22.05.2012, Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of the Central Province, holden

in Kandy, had allowed the appeal and dismissed the Plaintiff s case with costs.

The said decision of the Civil Appellate High Court was challenged before the Supreme Court by the

Plaintiff-Appellants by the instant application and when the instant application was supported before

the Supreme Court, Court granted leave on the following questions,

6

a) Did the Provincial High Court (exercising Civil Appellate Jurisdiction) factually err in

concluding that the boundaries of the land described in the schedule to the Plaint and

those shown in Plan No. 1901 (P1) are different except the northern boundary by

comparing the two sets of boundaries?

b) Did the Provincial High Court factually err in assuming that the Plaintiffs Land described in

the schedule to the plaint is only Dambuhena though their deeds refer to Western

portion of Kosgahamulahena and Dambuhena when the said schedule clearly refers to

both Gale Kosgahamulahena and Dambuhena?

c) Did the Provincial High Court also err in stating that according to P-1 Dambuhena is to the

north of the land shown in P-1 when the surveyor had clearly identified the land in P-1 as

the amalgamated land of Gala Kosgahamulahena and Dambuhena?

d) Did the Provincial High Court thus err in concluding that the Plaintiffs have not been able

to identify the land claimed by them?

e) Did the Provincial High Court err in concluding that the finding of the District Judge that

the subject matter of the action is depicted in plan P-1 as lots 1, 2 and 3 is not supported

by evidence?

f) Did the Provincial High Court err in allowing the appeal which includes a prayer that the

relief claimed by the 2nd Defendant in the answer be granted without citing any reasons

whatsoever to grant the said relief?

According to the plaint dated 1st September 1998 filed before the District Court of Kandy the Plaintiff-

Appellants had sought declaration of title of a land referred to in the schedule to the plaint as;

amalgamated land of Gale Kosgahamulahena of one Nelly of Kurakkan Sowing extent and

Dambuhena of seven Nelly of Kurakkan Sowing extent

7

which consist of lots 1, 2 and 3 of Plan No. 1901 dated 13.07.1996.

As revealed before us, a commission plan was not prepared in the case in hand (DC Kandy L 19332)

but the Plaintiff- Appellants had relied on Plan No. 1901 dated 13.07.1996 to identify the land in

question. The Plan No. 1901 which was produced marked P-1 at the District Court trial was a

Commission plan prepared by the Licensed Surveyor G. Heenkenda in District Court Kandy Case No. L

17966.

During the hearing before us, it was revealed that District Court Kandy L 17966 was an action filed by

the 1st Plaintiff-Appellant in the case in hand, against the same defendants but withdrawn, since it

was revealed that she only had the life interest to the property in question under the Kandyan Law

and instituted the present action along with her four children who are the heirs of their late father.

When the trial commenced before the District Court, all parties admitted that the previous action

filed before the District Court was on same cause of action and was withdrawn with liberty to file a

fresh action. Except for issue No. 22 raised on behalf of the 3rd Defendant-Respondent to the effect,

meKs,af,a 8 fjks fPaofha olajd we;s wxl 1901 orK msUqf

Wmf,aLkfha i|yka bvu fmkajd fkdue;af;ao@

none of the parties challenged the identity of the corpus.

At the conclusion of the District Court trial, whilst entering the judgment in favour of the Plaintiff-

Appellant, the District Judge had answered the above issue in the affirmative.

However when going through the questions of law under which the leave was granted and the

submissions placed before this court by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, it appears that the

8 question of identity of the land in question was one main ground for reversing the decision of the

District Court, by the Civil Appellate High Court of the Central Province holden in Kandy.

As observed by this court, whilst referring to some boundaries, the Judges of the Civil Appellate High

Court had concluded, that

In these circumstances it cannot be said that the Plaintiffs have been able to identify the land

to which they claimed title. The finding of the learned trial Judge, that the subject matter of

this action is depicted in Plan P-1 as lots 1 to 3 is not supported by evidence and therefore is

incorrect.

and proceeded to dismiss the plaintiffs action.

In the above circumstances, it is important to consider the evidence placed before the District Court

and ascertain whether the learned District Judge had correctly assessed the said evidence, and in the

said circumstances, the decision by the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court to interfere with the

finding of the trial Judge, who had the opportunity of observing the demeanor and deportment of the

witnesses, and to go through the plans and documents submitted before him by their makers, was

taken correctly, in the light of long line of authorities by Appellate Courts including the decision in the

case of Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 Sri LR 120 at 122 where his Lordship G.P.S de. Silva (CJ)

observed that;

It is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial judge who hears and sees witnesses

are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal

According to the plaint, the Plaintiffs (before the District Court) title to the land referred to in the

schedule to the plaint as, amalgamated land of Gale Kosgahamulahena of 01 Nelly of Kurakkan

sowing extent and Dambuhena of 07 Nelly of Kurakkan sowing which consist of lots 1, 2,and 3 in Plan

9 No. 1901 dated 13. 07. 1996 to the extent of 3 roods and 11 perches had devolved on the Plaintiffs as

explained in paragraphs 5 and 6 to the plaint; As submitted by the Plaintiffs the 1st and the 2nd

Defendants have allegedly created a dispute of the Plaintiffs land along the Western boundary, which

is part of lot 1 in Plan No. 1901.

Whilst disputing the above position, the 1st and the 2nd Defendants (before the District Court) took up

the position that a land about 1 Acre including the disputed area belongs to them and submitted a

cross claim for a declaration in respect of the said disputed area of land called Dambuhena Watta.

The 3rd Defendant, (before the District Court) who intervened in the District Court trial, had claimed

entitlement for a part of the land called Dambuhena through several deeds produced along with the

papers filed before court.

Whilst giving evidence before the District Court, summoned by the Plaintiff, one Gamini Heenkenda

a Licensed Surveyor had admitted preparing the Plan No. 1901 on a commission he received from the

District Court in case No. L 17966. By the single admission recorded during the trial, parties admitted

that,

L 17966 which was pending before the District Court in respect of the same cause of action,

was withdrawn with liberty to file fresh action

Whilst explaining the plan he prepared, the witness took up the position that he identified the corpus,

referred to in the schedule to the said plaint, included in the commission he received in case No.

L 17966.

According to witness Heenkenda the plan he prepared was referred to the land called the

amalgamated land of Gale Kosgahamulahena and Dambuhena and in preparing the said plan he took

guidance from the boundaries given in the schedule to the plaint.

10 During his evidence, the plaint in L 17966 and its schedule was produced marked P-2 and P-2a

respectively. According to P-2a the boundaries of the disputed land are as follows;

To North - boarder of Appuhamys land

To East - outer canal (msg we<)

To South - boarder of Godapale Gedara Dingiri Bandas land

To West - ditch (w,)

As observed by me, these are the same boundaries referred to in the schedule to the plaint in the

instant case.

In his evidence witness Heenkenda had said that he could identify the land in the ground, and

prepared the Plan No. 1901 based on his findings. It was his evidence that, the ditch referred to above

had been cut and converted to a road by the 1st and 2nd Defendants. The said area was at the West

edge of lot 1 of the commissioned plan and it was marked as X-Y in Plan No.1901. The 1st Plaintiff who

was present at the inspection had pointed out lot 01 and the area identify as X-Y as the encroachment

by the 1st and the 2nd Defendants.

As further revealed from the evidence of witness Heenkenda, one Godapale Gedara Seveviratne

Banda the 3rd Defendant in DC Kandy Case No. L 17966 (who is the 1st Defendant in the instant case)

was also present during the survey and submitted plan bearing No.2967 dated 03.09.1992 prepared

by A. B. Weerasekara licensed Surveyor and he made use of the said plan when making 1901. The

said plan was produced at the instant case marked P-3.

The learned District Judge when analyzing the evidence placed before him had referred to both the

plans submitted before him marked P-1 and P-3 and had correctly observed that the land depicted in

Plan 2967 (P-3) is the Northern boundary of the disputed land identified in Plan No.1901.

11 Even though the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court had stated that they have a doubt with regard

to the other boundaries, according to P-1 the plan bearing No. 1901, the Eastern boundary had been

identified as outer canal. The Southern boundary to the said land in question is, land earlier belongs

to Dingiri Banda and presently belongs to the 1st Defendant (in case No. L 17966) and the Western

boundary is the ditch said to have cut by 3rd Defendant (in case No. L 17966) when compared the

said boundaries with boundaries referred to in schedule to the plaint in the instant case, the position

taken up by the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court, that except for the Northern

boundary the other boundaries do not tally with each other does not appear to be correct.

The learned Counsel, who represented the Plaintiff-Appellants before us, had also submitted that

nowhere in the plaint or in the proceeding before the District Court, the Plaintiff had referred to the

land in dispute as Danduhena but always referred to it as, amalgamated land of Gale

Kosgahamulahena of one Nelly of Kurakkan sowing extent and Dambuhena of seven Nelly of Kurakkan

sowing extent

However, according to the impugned Judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Judge had

further observed that,

It is pertinent to note that assuming the land claimed by the Plaintiffs is not Danduhena as

referred to in the schedule to the plaint but Dambuhena the deeds relied on by the Plaintiffs

to establish their title do not refer to a separate allotment of land called Dambuhena. The

deeds refer to two contiguous allotments of land that is Southern portion of

Kosgahamulahena and Dambuhena but according to the plain P-1 Dambuhena is to the

north of the land surveyed by him. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the Plaintiffs

have been able to identify land to which they claimed title.

12 When considering the material already discussed by me, I am reluctant to agree with the above

observation made by the Civil Appellate High Court when reversing the findings of the learned District

Judge.

I further observed that the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court had erred in law by reversing the

findings of the District Judge of Kandy when the evidence placed before the District Court support the

said finding of the District Court.

In the said circumstances, I answer the questions (a) (e) raised on behalf of the Petitioner-Appellants

in affirmative. There is no material before me to answer questions (f) and therefore I will not answer

the said question.

The Judgment dated 22.05.2012 by the Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court of Central Province is

set aside and the Judgment dated 27.06.2007 by the District Judge, Kandy is affirmed. The learned

District Judge of Kandy is directed to enter decree accordingly.

Appeal allowed.
