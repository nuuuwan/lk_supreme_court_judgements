The 2nd petitioner who is the mother of the 1st petitioner and the 1st Petitioner by

their Petition dated 01.02.2019 have complained to this Court that their

fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the constitution were infringed

by the Respondents when the 1st Respondent wrongfully and arbitrarily refused to

admit the 2nd Petitioner’s daughter (1st Petitioner) to grade 1 of the Visakha

Vidyalaya, Colombo 05.

The reason given for this refusal appears to be that the Petitioners had failed to

obtain required minimum marks under the category they applied for the

admission as per the Circular marked P 11. This court by its order dated

05.03.2019 granted leave to proceed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

On or about 1st July 2018, as the mother of the 1st Petitioner, the 2nd Petitioner,

duly submitted an application for admissions of the 1st Petitioner to grade 1 of

the Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo 05, under the category “Children of persons in

the staff of institutions directly involved in the school education”( for easy

reference hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Education Category”) - vide

clause 6(IV) of P11 and application marked as P12 . The 2nd Petitioner states that

being a teacher of the Sri Lanka Teacher Service, the 1st Petitioner is entitled to be

selected under the aforesaid category.

Page 5 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

In addition to the application for admission made to Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo

05, applications on behalf of the 1st Petitioner were also submitted to Sirmavo

Bandaranayike Vidyalaya, Colombo and St. Paul’s Girls’ School, Milagiriya. The 1st

Petitioner was offered admission to St. Paul’s Girls’ School, Milagiriya. The

Petitioners state that, however, the first and the most preferred choice was

Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo 05.

Petitioners were called under the Education Category for an interview held on

25th August 2018 at Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo 05. The 2nd Petitioner states that

at the interview;

• Upon perusal of the documents produced by the Petitioners,

the 1st Petitioner was awarded only 40 marks.

• The Petitioners were wrongfully and arbitrarily deprived of 15

marks that should have been awarded for the 2nd Petitioner’s

service in a “difficult” area i.e. at Primary Section of the

Minneriya Central College/National College. (whether what is

needed is service in a difficult area or service in a difficult school will be

discussed later on this judgment)

• Above marks were not awarded arbitrarily, in spite of the 2nd

Petitioner having duly earned them and such being officially

certified by the relevant authorities. In this regard courts

attention has been brought to P10.

• However, 1st Respondent has refused to grant marks under

category of ‘period of service in difficult schools’, stating that

Page 6 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

the Minneriya Primary School is not a difficult school as per

Directive 2005/01 marked as P19. (This court observes that what is

mentioned in P14 is that Minneriya Primary School which belongs to

Minneriya Central College is not a difficult School as per the 2005 CD)

• Thereafter, the 2nd petitioner was given a mark sheet (P14) to

sign which the 2nd petitioner signed as she had no choice. (vide

paragraph 22 of the Petition)

The Petitioners further submitted that the temporary list (P15) of the students

who had been selected for admission were released and displayed on or about

21st November 2018 and the 1st Petitioner had secured admission as the last child.

Thus, the 2nd Petitioner did not take any action to canvass for the 15 marks that

should have been awarded for the period of services in a difficult school - vide

paragraph 24 of the petition.

It appears that after an appeal made by another applicant the 1st Petitioner was

removed from the list to include the said applicant’s child. P17 was written to the

3rd Respondent Secretary only after the release of the final list.

The Petitioners state that on 4th January 2019, the 2nd Petitioner had been

informed by the secretary to the appeals board that, upon considering an appeal

under the same category, 1st Petitioner was removed from the final list which was

to be released on the next day. This was evidenced by not having the 1st

Petitioner’s name in the final list published on 5th January 2019 (P16) – vide

paragraphs 25 and 26 of the Petition.

Page 7 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

Being aggrieved by the above turn of events, the 2nd Petitioner on 08th of January

2019 submitted an appeal(P17) to the Secretary to the Ministry of Education (3rd

Respondent). The Petitioners state that they received a partial response to P17 by

the letter marked P18 -vide paragraph 27 of the Petition. Nevertheless, letter

marked P18 itself indicates that it was issued on the request of the 2nd Petitioner.

The said letter marked P18 issued by Director of Education (Data management)

reads that, they have categorized school-lists as per circular No.2005/01 (P19)

only by way of reports of school census taken from 01.06.2005.It further reveals

that, since they do not have categorization as per the facilities available prior to

01.06.2005, they cannot express whether the schools concerned ( Minneriya

Central College and Minneriya Primary School) were difficult schools but it clearly

says that as per the census of schools in 2005 the Minneriya Central College was

considered as a ‘very convenient school’ and as per the 2013 census Minneriya

Primary School was an ‘convenient school’. It is also stated in P18 that it is

advisable to check the log book of the school or to ask the opinion of the Zonal

Director of Education. However, as the categorization has to be done according to

the Circular No.2005/01 dated 18.01.2005, non availability of such categorization

as per the said circular prior to 2005 is fathomable and further, since, as per P9,

the Minneriya Primary College was established on 31.12.2012, availability of its

categorization from 2013 can also be understood.

Further the Petitioners in their petition refers to the criteria referred to in circular

marked P19 and give a self-assessment to indicate that Minneriya Primary

School/Section was a difficult school during her tenure of service prior to her

transfer from the same to Ananda College.

Page 8 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

As per the Petition, it is clear that the stance of the Petitioners is that the service

of the 2nd Petitioner in the aforesaid school in Minneriya should have been

considered for all intent and purposes as a service in a difficult school (vide

paragraph 28 of the petition) and they should have been awarded 15 marks for

that. In this regard the Petitioners seem to rely on the letter marked as P10 issued

by the Principal of the Minneriya Primary School and certified by the Zonal

Director of Education. (Whether this document submitted as P10 is supportive to establish

the Petitioners’ case will be discussed later in this judgment.) However, the Petitioners

argue before this court that the Petitioners were awarded only 40 marks when

they should have been awarded 55 marks under the category they applied for the

admission. The threshold mark was 42.5 under the aforesaid category. The

Petitioners allege that the denial of admission of the 1st Petitioner to Visakha

Vidyalaya, Colombo 05 is arbitrary and amounts to a violation of petitioners’

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

However, it appears that the marks given by Sirirmawo Bandaranaike Vidyalaya is

the same as Visakha Vidyalaya while St. Paul’s Girls’ School had given 15 marks for

the 2nd Petitioner’s service in difficult schools to total up the marks given to the

Petitioners to be 55 marks for the application made to that school.

The Petitioners have tendered the following documents in support of their case

before this court. Some of them have already been referred to above.

• P1- Birth Certificate of the 1st Petitioner

The 3rd Respondent filing his affidavit in objection has stated that the 2nd

Respondent was appointed on 04.01.1999 to the Minneriya National School and

was transferred from the said school on 06.09.2005 and transfer was done by the

Ministry since the said school as a National School came under the Ministry. In

Page 11 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

this regard he has brought this court’s attention to P3 and P5A and also to P4B

service certificate which was issued by the Principal of Minneriya National School

after her transfer from the said school. The stance of the 3rd Respondent is that

Minneriya National School was a convenient school and generally national schools

are not classified as difficult schools. The 3rd Respondent admits that the primary

section of the Minneriya National school was made a separate school in

December 2012.In this respect he has submitted the document marked as R1 and

R1 states that, in 1992, the said primary section was taken away to a place about

1 Km away from the main school but was administered by the Minneriya National

School till its separation as a primary school on 31.12.2012. The 3rd respondent

submits that the document marked P10 is not a valid document since it is issued

by the Minneriya Primary School which did not exist prior to 2012 and does not

have the service records of the 2nd Petitioner and such service certificate can only

be issued by the Minneriya National School where the 2nd Respondent served till

2005. The document marked as R2 by the said Respondent indicates that only the

records of 2005/2004 census are available and as per the schedule relating to

2004 census of schools, Minneriya central college was referred to as a National

School and it was also a popular school. It also reveals that the said Central

College was promoted as a National School on 12.03.1996. Thus, the stance of the

3rd Respondent is that the service of the 2nd Respondent in Minneriya was at the

Minneriya Central college which became a National School in 1996 and her

service was not in a difficult school.

SC/FR/39/19.

Analysis of the Case.

The issue to be determined by this court is whether the Petitioners’ Fundamental

Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution had been violated by

the 1st Respondent by the refusal to grant 15 marks to the Petitioners’ application

under the category of “period of service in difficult schools”, taking into account

the service of the 2nd Petitioner in the Minneriya Central College/ National School

as a teacher in its primary section, which refusal deprived the admission of the 1st

petitioner to grade 1 of the Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo 05.

It is not in dispute that provisions in the Circular dated 31st May 2018 of the

Secretary to the Ministry of Education (herein after sometimes referred to as the

“Admission Circular”) marked “p11” is applicable to the admission of students to

Grade One of Government Schools in the respective year the Petitioners

preferred their application.

As per the said circular, the Petitioners’ application for the admission to grade 1 in

2019 was governed by clause 6.4 of the said circular.

In terms of Clause 6.4(b) of the Admission Circular, marks under this Category is

allocated under six main grounds,

I. Period of service as a permanent employee in the staff of an institution

under Ministry of Education that directly involves in school education (one

mark for one year -maximum 20 marks);

II. Period of service in difficult schools

• For applicants presently serving in a difficult school without a break

(5 marks per year -maximum 25 marks);

Page 13 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

• For applicants previously served in a difficult school (3 marks per

year – maximum 15 marks)

(half a mark is given for period of 6 months or for the period

exceeding 6 months when the applicant has completed a minimum

of one-year service).

However, this service in a difficult school has to be certified by the

relevant Zonal Director of Education. (What is highlighted here is found in

Clause 6.4 (b) II of the Circular marked P11 and is the most relevant provision for

the matter placed before this court)

III. Unutilized leave during the last 5 years (2 marks for each 20 days of

unutilized leave per year - maximum 10 marks);

IV. For applicant’s service in the same school where child’s admission is sought

(3 years or more 10 marks, less than 3 years 5 marks – maximum 10 marks);

V. Distance from present permanent place of residence to the school applied

(Within one Km- 10 marks, Between 1Km and 3Km- 8 marks, Between 3Km

and 5Km- 6 marks, More than 5 Km – 4 marks-- maximum 10 marks);

VI. Distance from present place of work to the school applied for (More than

100 Km – 25 marks, Between 70Km and 100Km – 20 marks, Between 40Km

and 70 Km- 15 marks, Between 20Km and 40Km- 10 marks, Less than 20Km

5 marks--- maximum 25 marks).

On certain occasions in their petition the Petitioners state that marks were not

allocated to the service of the 2nd Petitioner in difficult areas. However, this court

observes that as per the clause 6.4.(b) II of circular marked as P11 marks are

considered for service in difficult schools and not for the service in difficult areas.

As per the said clause service in difficult schools has to be certified by the relevant

Page 14 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

Zonal Director of Education in accordance with the Circular No. 2005/01. The

Circular No.2005/01 marked as P19 categorizes types of schools and gives

directions on how to categorize schools within different Provinces into five

categories, namely very convenient, convenient, not inconvenient, difficult or

very difficult. Thus, it is clear that to prove infringement of fundamental rights as

alleged by the Petitioners, the Petitioners must prove that the 2nd Petitioner

serves or served in a difficult school.

It is not in dispute that the 2nd petitioner at the time she tendered the

application for admission was working at Thurstan College, Colombo 07 and the

Petitioners do not claim said college as a difficult school, and thus, the Petitioners

cannot claim maximum 25 marks or less marks given under the criteria ‘presently

working in a difficult school without a break for 5 years or less’ as per the clause

6.4 (b)– II – a. Then, it needs to be considered whether the petitioners are coming

within Clause 6.4 (b) – II – (b) of the Admission Circular as the 2nd Petitioner

claims for the service in a difficult school in previous years in relation to her

service In Minneriya from 1999 to 2005.

There is no disagreement that the 2nd Petitioner was appointed to the Minneriya

Central College, Polonnaruwa (In some documents the name of this school is

mentioned as Minneriya National School, Polonnaruwa) with effect from 4th

January 1999, where she was assigned to the primary section. She served in the

primary section of the above school from 4th Jan 1999 to 25th September 2005

(approximately 6 years and 8 months). It is the stance of the 2nd Petitioner that

her service in the said school is a service in a difficult school and, thus, the 1st

petitioner should be awarded the 15 marks as per clause 6.4 (b) – II – (b), taking

Page 15 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

into consideration the fact that the 2nd petitioner worked in the said school for

more than 5 years. However, as evident by the mark sheet marked “P14”, the

Petitioners were not awarded under the item ‘period of service in difficult

schools’ and the reason stated therein is that the Primary School belonging to

Minneriya Central College was not a difficult school as per the 2005 CD’. Thereby,

the issue before this court is whether the primary section of the Minneriya

Central College, Polonnaruwa/ Minneriya National School can be considered as a

“Difficult school” for the purposes of allocating marks under Clause 6.4 – II – b.

A careful reading of clause 6.4 of P 11 makes it apparent that marks are given to

service in a difficult school in accordance with the classification found in the

Circular No. 2005/01 (P19). P19 categorizes schools and not separate sections of

schools. This court observes that as per the material placed before this court the

Minneriya Primary School became a separate school only in 2012 under the

relevant Provincial Council – vide P9. Prior to that it was under the Minneriya

National School as its Primary Section. In fact, the 2nd Petitioner’s appointment

was to the Minneriya Central College which was named as a National School in

1996 (see P3, P4, P4A, P4B, P5A, R1 and R2). The evidence indicates that she had

worked as a primary section teacher in that national school. Even her

appointment and transfer stated in P3 and P5A refers to an appointment to a

national school and transfer from a national school. In fact, her transfer was

termed as a transfer from a National School (Jathika Pasala) to National School

(Jathika Pasala)- vide P5A. Aforementioned documents submitted by the

Petitioners themselves prove that the 2nd Petitioner’s service was as a teacher of

Minneriya Central College/ National School. Thus, what is relevant is whether

Minneriya National School / Minneriya Central College was a difficult school as

Page 16 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

per P19. The Petitioners have not placed any material to show that Minneriya

Central College or National School was a difficult school as per P19. The document

marked P18 reveals Minneriya Central College was considered as a very

convenient school as per the census made in 2005. R1 and R2 also indicate it was

considered as a popular school and became a national school in 1996. It is hard to

assume that a difficult school would be given the status of a national school or

become a popular school. Furthermore, as the circular marked P19 categorizes

only schools and not separate sections of schools, it is not wrong in assuming that

the whole school was assessed as one unit for the classification and, as such

different sections cannot be considered as having a different classification or

rating. On the other hand, if the Petitioners’ attempt to show that the primary

section of the Minneriya Central College/National College as a separate school to

succeed, they must establish at least its administration was separate from the

main school by showing that it had a separate principal and an office etc. No

sufficient materials were placed before this court by the Petitioners to that effect

but the documents marked P3, P4, P4A, P4B, P5A and P8 shows that the 2nd

Petitioner’s appointment was to the Minneriya Central College which was a

National School. Her service also was to that school and she was transferred from

that national school to another national school, namely Ananda college, Colombo-

vide P5A. Hence, it is not logical to treat her service as one belonged to a different

school other than the Minneriya Central College/National School, even though

the primary section was situated on a different location about 1Km away from the

main section.

The documents marked as P9 and R1 confirms that the Primary section of

Minneriya Central College, which located about 1Km away from the main section,

Page 17 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

was established as a separate Primary School governed by the Provincial Council

in 2012. Based on that, it appears that the Petitioners try to contend that the

primary section of Minneriya Central College had all the attributes of a separate

school and it has to be considered as a difficult school due to the lack of facilities

at the time the 2nd Petitioner worked there. This cannot be considered as a

tenable contention for many reasons. Firstly, the aforesaid primary school was

established in 2012 after 6 years from the transfer of the 2nd Petitioner from

Minneriya National School ; Secondly, P9 and R1 establish that primary section of

the Minneriya National School was under the administration of the said national

school till 2012.12.31 indicating that the said primary section was part and parcel

of the said national school and not a separate school. Thirdly, it appears that the

Minneriya Primary School acquired the attributes of a separate school only in

2013 under a new administration, separated from the National school and as a

Provincial Council School.

The Circular No, 2005/01 marked P19 states that it rescinds the circular 1998/47

dated 11.12.1998 which was for the classification of schools for certain purposes

prior to P19. It should be noted that for the purposes of circular marked as

P11(Admission Circular) what is relevant is not the previous circulars or their

classifications but the classification under the Circular marked P19. Irrespective of

the fact that relevant person’s service was done prior to 2005 or after, for the

marks to be given the relevant school has to be a difficult school as per circular

marked P19. Minneriya Primary School which was established in 2012 was a

nonexistent entity when the circular marked P19 came into force in 2005. What

was in existence was Minneriya National School and the 2nd Petitioner was a

teacher of its Primary section. Thus, as said before what is relevant for the

Page 18 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

Petitioners’ application for admission is the category of the Minneriya National

School as per P19. However, it appears that after the establishment of the

Minneriya Primary School as a separate entity in 2012, it has been classified as a

convenient school in 2013 – vide P18. As mentioned before the Petitioners have

neither placed sufficient material with the application for the interview nor

before this court to show that the Minneriya National School was a difficult school

as per Circular marked P19. What appears to have been submitted with the

application for the interview as well as before this court is P10 which refers to a

nonexistent entity at the time of 2nd Respondent’s service at Minneriya. This

certificate marked P10, dated 20.09.2017 has been issued by the Principal of

Minneriya Primary School and certified by the Zonal Director of Education. It

states that the 2nd Petitioner served as a Primary Teacher at the Minneriya

Primary School between 04.01.1999 and 25.09.2005, which was a difficult School.

Since it appears that the Petitioners are relying heavily on P10, it is necessary to

comment why it is not acceptable to this court. The following reasons can be

emphasized in that regard to show why it is not sufficient or reliable;

• As mentioned before Minneriya Primary school was established in 2012

and, as such, there cannot be a Minneriya Primary School as a separate

entity prior to that. Thus, as said before, this certificate has been issued for

a school which had no existence during the tenure of the 2nd Petitioner in

Minneriya area.

• The content of this certificate is contrary to Petitioners own documents

marked P3, P4, P4A, P4B and P5A, owing to the fact that when P10 states

Page 19 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

that the 2nd Petitioner was a teacher of Minneriya Primary School, the rest

confirms that she was a teacher attached to Minneriya National School.

• What is required by the circular marked P11 is a certification of service in a

difficult school by the Zonal Education Director in accordance with the

Circular marked P19, namely Circular No.2005/01. The said circular was not

addressed to the principals of schools though it was also intended to be

distributed among the principals but Zonal directors of Education are

among the addressees of the said circular. Thus, it appears to be the duty of

the Zonal Directors to classify schools as per the directions and guidance in

the said circular. Therefore, it is the Zonal Director of Education who can

certify whether one’s service was in a difficult school or not and as shown

above, that is what is expected by the circular marked P11. However, P10 is

basically a certificate issued by the Principal of the Minneriya Primary

School. Though he expressed that it is a difficult school there is nothing to

indicate whether it is his personal opinion or as per the guidance or

directions of the Circular marked P19. The Zonal Director of Education has

just certified it. It is not clear whether the Zonal Director certified it to

indicate that it is a document issued by the relevant Principal, one of his

subordinate officers or whether he certified what is stated there as true.

However, it is clear that neither the Principal nor the Zonal Director of

Education has certified that the service of the 2nd Petitioner in Minneriya

was a service in a difficult school as per the circular marked P19. A mere

statement or opinion saying that one served in a difficult school will not

suffice for the marks to be allocated as per circular marked P11. It should

be a certificate from the Zonal Director certifying that relevant person’s

Page 20 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

service was a service in a difficult school as per circular No.2005/01 marked

P19. There is no reference to circular marked P19 in P10. On the other

hand, Minneriya Primary School was not an entity that existed in 2005,

when the circular P19 was issued, to be classified under the said circular. As

per P18 issued by the Office of the Director of Education (Data

Management), it appears that after the establishment of the Minneriya

Primary School in 2012, it has been categorized as a convenient school and

even in 2005 Minneriya Central College was a very convenient school.

The Petitioners have submitted a self-assessment of the Primary School in her

petition, applying criteria in Circular No.2005/01 marked P19 to a factual

situation stated by them as that existed during the 2nd Petitioner’s tenure in

Minneriya, to indicate that it was a difficult school. In this regard this court

observes as follows;

▪ This is a self-serving assessment and not an independent one. There is

no independent evidence to confirm the factual situation they refer in

that assessment.

▪ Self-assessment has been done by taking the primary section as a

separate school but as discussed above it appears that there was no

separate school during 2nd Petitioner’s service in Minneriya except for a

separate primary section situated 1Km away from the main school. The

Circular marked P19 categorizes schools and not their separate sections

and the Circular marked P11 contemplates whether the relevant school

is/was a difficult school in giving marks but not its separate sections.

Since the 2nd Petitioner was a teacher of the Minneriya National School

as established by P3 to P5A, what applies is the category of the said

National school.

▪ Irrespective of whether the service of the relevant person was done

prior or after the enforcement of the Circular marked P19, the circular

marked P11 considers the categorization of schools as per the circular

marked P19 in giving marks. One has to show, to get marks for the

service done previously in a difficult school, that he worked in a school

for a period exceeding one year and it was a difficult school as per the

circular marked P19 ( 3 marks per year subject to a maximum of 15)-

vide clause 6.4(b) II(b). Naturally the assessment as per the circular

should have been done after the enforcement of the circular in 2005

applying the relevant criteria to factual situation that existed after the

enforcement of the relevant circular. As evidenced by the P19 circular

itself there had been a previous circular to categorize schools which was

rescinded by P19, but what is relevant is whether the relevant school

was a difficult school as per P19. As such, applying the criteria in P19 to

a factual situation that existed prior to the enforcement of P19, as done

in the self-assessment, cannot be considered as the correct way of

assessing the school as per P19. For example, one criterion in P19 is the

number of useable computers the school has. If this is applied to

schools that existed in 1999 which was the year the 2nd Petitioner

started her service in Minneriya, the balance with regard to assessment

of most of the schools would tilt towards the ‘difficult school’ status. It

is the view of this court that what is relevant is not applying the criteria

in P19 to a situation in the past, but rather, the assessment/ category of

Page 22 of 23

SC/FR/39/19.

the school when P19 was applied after its enforcement. Thus, the way

the self-assessment is done is also questionable.

▪ Anyhow, what is required by the Circular marked P11 is not a self-

assessment but a certificate from the Zonal Director of Education with

regard to the relevant school. Thus, what should have been tendered

was a certificate with regard to the Minneriya National School under

which the 2nd Petitioner did her service. Instead of that what was

tendered is a purported certificate (P10) with regard to the Minneriya

Primary School which came into existence as a separate entity only in

2012.

For the reasons mentioned above this court cannot rely on the self-assessment

done by the Petitioners. Merely because St. Paul’s Girls’ School, Milagiriya gave

marks for the 2nd Petitioners service in Minneriya considering it as service in a

difficult school this court cannot find fault with the Respondent for not giving

marks due to the reasons elaborated above. This case is not based on an alleged

infringement by the provisions in relevant circulars but, on an alleged

infringement caused by not giving marks by the Respondent for the 2nd

Petitioner’s service in the primary section of the Minneriya National School as per

the relevant circulars with regard to the application made for the admission for

grade one for the year 2019. It is the view of this court that the Petitioners failed

in establishing that her service was for a difficult school as contemplated by the

said circulars.

Thus, this court cannot find fault with the Respondents. Hence, the application is

dismissed. No costs.
