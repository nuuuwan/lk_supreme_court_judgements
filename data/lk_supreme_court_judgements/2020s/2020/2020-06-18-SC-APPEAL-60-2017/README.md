In this case, the Applicant - Petitioner - Appellant - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondent) has made an application to the Magistrates Court of

Colombo seeking a mandatory order from the learned Magistrate under section 28 A (3)

of the Urban Development Law (hereinafter sometimes referred to as UDA Law), to

demolish an unauthorized construction. This was pursuant to the Respondent -

Respondent - Respondent - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant) defaulting the compliance with a notice issued under section 28 A (1) of the

UDA Law.

Learned Magistrate having considered the material before him, had pronounced his order

dated 20-02-2009, rejecting the application made by the Respondent on the basis that

the said application is misconceived in law.

Being aggrieved by this order, the Respondent filed a revision application in the Provincial

High Court of Western Province holden in Colombo seeking to revise the said order of the

learned Magistrate. The Provincial High Court after hearing parties had pronounced its

order dated 19-11-2010 dismissing the said revision application.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal

challenging the said order of the Provincial High Court. The Court of Appeal after the

argument of the case, by its judgment dated 16-10-2015 set aside both the judgment of

the Provincial High Court and the judgment of the Magistrates Court. The Court of Appeal

by the said judgment has directed the Magistrate to hold a proper inquiry in to the

application filed by the Respondent.

It is against the said judgment of the Court of Appeal that the Appellant has filed the

instant appeal in this Court.

This Court, when the leave to appeal application pertaining to the instant appeal was

supported, having heard the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

appellant and the learned Counsel for the Respondent, by its order dated 16-03-2017,

has granted leave to appeal in respect of the questions of law set out in paragraph 35

(a) - (g) of the petition dated 27-11-2015. The said questions of law could be identified

as follows.

1) Is the judgment of the Court of Appeal contrary to law and against the weight of

evidence?

2) Is the delegation of authority made in favour of the Respondent to institute the

action bearing No. 9341/5 in the Magistrates Court of Colombo bad in law, illegal

and ultra vires the provisions in section 23 (5) of the Urban Development Authority

Law No. 41 of 1978 (as amended)?

3) Whether in the said circumstances, the Respondent could have lawfully instituted

the case bearing No. 9341/5 in the Magistrates Court of Colombo?

4 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 4 of 20

4) Did the Court of Appeal err in directing the Magistrate to hold a proper inquiry in

to the application of the Respondent?

5) Did the Court of Appeal err by holding that the section under which the Appellant

was charged by the Respondent is section 28 (1) of the Urban Development

Authority Law 04 of 1982?

6) Did the Court of Appeal fail to consider that the application to the Magistrates

Court had been made in terms of section 28 A (3) of the Urban Development

Authority Law (as amended) which is specifically to seek an order to demolish an

unauthorized construction?

7) Did the Court of Appeal fail to consider that the Appellant would have to be found

guilty of an offence in a case instituted in terms of section 136 (1) of the Criminal

Procedure Code in order to impose a fine in terms of section 28 (1) or 28 (2) of

the Urban Development Authority Law (as amended)?

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant has advanced three arguments. They

are as follows.1

1. The delegation of authority to the Respondent in terms of section 23(5) of the

UDA Law is bad in law, illegal and ultra vires.

2. The Respondent has intervened unlawfully into a dispute between the Appellant

and the landlord and therefore the application filed in the Magistrates Court by

the Respondent cannot be maintained.

3. The application of the Respondent filed in the Magistrates Court is misconceived

because it contained the prayers to convict the Appellant under section 28 (2) of

the UDA Law and impose a fine of Rs.1000 per each day the Appellant continues

to commit that offence.

1 Vide written submissions filed by the Appellant.

5 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 5 of 20

Considering the first argument set out above, would involve interpreting section 23 (5)

of UDA Law as amended. Thus, it would be convenient at the outset to reproduce the

said section. It is as follows.

S. 23(5)

The Authority may delegate to any officer of a local authority, in consultation with that

local authority, any of its powers, duties and functions relating to planning within any

area declared to be a development area under section 3, and such officer shall exercise,

perform or discharge any such power, duty or function so delegated, under the direction,

supervision and control of the Authority.

It is the contention of the Appellant that the delegation of power by the UDA in terms of

the above section can only be done with regard to the activities of planning and not

regarding development activities. The Appellant had relied on the judgement of

Jayasinghe Vs Seethawakapura Urban Council and others2, which had been decided by a

bench comprising a single Judge of the Court of Appeal. In that case, His Lordship

Sripavan J (as he then was) in his judgment dated 09-06-2003, had held inter alia;

i. that it is well settled that statutory powers can only be exercised by Public bodies

invested with such powers and not by others;

ii. that the powers which can be delegated are only the powers duties and functions

relating to planning;

iii. that the matters relating to development activities are not capable of being

delegated under the said section.

Thereafter, by the judgment dated 29-05-2009, a bench of two judges of the Court of

Appeal in the case of Muniyandy paneer Selvan Vs Kuragamage Harishchandra Perera of

the Municipal Engineers Department (Drawing) of Colombo Municipal Council and Hon.

Attorney General3 also took the same view as in Jayasinghes case with regard to the

interpretation of section 23(5) of UDA Law. His Lordship W L Ranjith Silva J in that case

(Muniyandy paneer Selvans case) cited Jayasinghes case with approval and held;

2 2003 3 SLR 40. 3 CA (PHC) APN 170/2007, decided on 29-05-2009.

6 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 6 of 20

i. that section 23(5) of UDA Law as amended has only conferred power upon the

UDA to delegate to any officer of the local authority, its powers, duties and

functions relating to planning and nothing else and nothing more; and

ii. that therefore the UDA had no power or justification to delegate powers to District

Inspector of the Colombo Municipal Council to file action against the petitioner in

that case under section 28 A (3) of the UDA Law.

The Court of Appeal bench in Muniyandy paneer Selvans case had disagreed with the

judgment of a single judge bench of the Court of Appeal in the case of E R M Piyasena

(Chairman Urban Council, Bandarawela) Vs H M Wijesooriya.4 His Lordship Dr. A De Z

Gunawardana J (as he then was) had stated in E R M Piyasenas case (decided on 04-11-

1994) that the delegation of powers relating to planning referred to in section 23(5) of

the UDA Law would include the taking steps to enforce planning procedures and it was

in the exercise of that function that the chairman Urban Council Bandarawela had filed

the relevant case in the Magistrates Court.

It would be pertinent to note that in 2002, a bench of two Judges of Court of Appeal had

followed the decision of E R M Piyasenas case in the case of S Sivapragasam and two

others Vs Robert Jayaseelan Perimpanayagam of Municipal Council Batticaloa and

Saravanamuttu Navaneethan - Special Commissioner, Municipal Council Batticaloa.5 His

Lordship Gamini Amaratunga J in the judgment of that case (Sivapragasams case) has

cited and followed the judgment in E R M Piyasenas case confirming that the functions

of planning would include the taking of steps to enforce planning procedures. His Lordship

Gamini Amaratunga J in that case affirmed the conclusion of the learned High Court Judge

that the Mayor of Batticaloa Municipal Council had the authority to institute proceedings

against owner of an unauthorized construction to obtain an order for its demolition. The

relevant part of the said judgment (Sivapragasams case) is as follows.

The argument adduced on behalf of the present appellants was that delegation of

functions relating to planning activities did not extend to the demolition of unauthorized

4 CA Application No. 119/1990 decided on 04-11-1994. 5 CA (PHC) Appeal 02/1997, decided on 16-05-2002.

7 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 7 of 20

structures and accordingly Mayor did not have the authority to make an application for a

mandatory demolition order. The learned High Court Judge held that the delegation of

the functions of planning would include the taking of steps to enforce planning procedure

and accordingly the Mayor had the authority to institute proceedings against owner of an

unauthorized building for an order to demolish such building. The learned High Court

Judges conclusion finds support from the decision of this Court in Piyasena V Wijesooriya

CA Application 119/90 - CA Minutes of 4-11-1994 where it was held that functions of

planning would include the taking of steps to enforce planning procedure.

It was in the above backdrop that the District Inspector of the Colombo Municipal Council

being aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal pronounced in Muniyandy paneer

Selvam6s case had appealed to the Supreme Court. This was because (as has already

been mentioned above), the Court of Appeal in that case, had held inter alia, that the

UDA had no power or jurisdiction to delegate its powers to the Colombo Municipal Council

to file action against the Respondent, as section 23 (5) of the UDA Act (as amended by

Act No 04 of 1982) had only permitted delegation of powers duties and functions relating

to planning.

The Supreme Court in the said appeal (Palligoda Withanage Keerthi Wimal Withana

(District Inspector - Colombo Municipal Council) Vs Muniyandy paneer Selvam)7 had

focused on the following two questions of law.

i. Did the Court of Appeal err in law in interpreting section 23 (5) and 28 A (3) of the

Urban Development Authority Law as amended by Act No. 04 of 1982?

ii. Did the Court of Appeal misconstrue the provisions of the Urban Development

Authority Act No. 04 of 1982?

In the judgment of the Supreme Court, His Lordship Sripavan J, having analyzed the

provisions in section 23 (5) and section 28 A, stated as follows.

6 Ibid. 7 SC Appeal No. 123/2009 decided on 18-01-2012.

8 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 8 of 20

for the reasons set out above, I hold that the provisions contained in section 28 A (3)

fall within the scope of the term planning and therefore the powers, duties and functions

referred to therein could be delegated by the UDA to any officer of a local authority

The Supreme Court answered the above two questions of law in the affirmative, set aside

the judgment of the Court of Appeal and affirmed and restored the mandatory order of

the Magistrate authorizing the Colombo Municipal Council to demolish the relevant

unauthorized construction.

Indeed, the Supreme Court in the above judgement has referred to the case of Jayasinghe

Vs Seethawakapura Urban Council.8 The relevant portion in the judgment is reproduced

below for convenience.

The learned counsel for the First Respondent relied on the judgement in Jayasinghe

V Seethawakapura Urban Council (2003) 3 S L R 40. It is observed that Jayasinghes case

dealt with a situation where there was no delegation of power under section 23 (5) of

the UDA Act.

Further, in that case the Urban Council purported to act under section 84 (1) of the Urban

Councils ordinance within an area declared as a development area by the UDA without

any delegation of power by the UDA. The dicta in Jayasinghes case is distinguishable

from the present case and cannot apply to the facts and circumstances of this

application

In the instant case, the argument advanced by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Appellant is that the Bench hearing this case should not follow the judgment in Muniyandy

paneer Selvams9 case. It is his submission that the observation by the Supreme Court

that Jayasinghes case dealt with a situation where there was no delegation of power

under section 23 (5) of the UDA Act is erroneous and that therefore the Court of Appeal

judgment in Jayasinghes case must continue to be valid. Learned Presidents Counsel for

the Appellant has advanced the above argument based on the sentence Learned

Deputy Solicitor General urged that the third respondent has delegated its powers to the

8 Supra. 9 SC Appeal No. 123/2009 decided on 13-06-2011.

9 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 9 of 20

Chairman of the second respondent under section 23(5) of the UDA Law which is

found in the Court of Appeal judgment of Jayasinghes case.

Perusal of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Jayasinghes case reveals the followings.

i. What the petitioner in that case has filed is an application for a writ of certiorari

seeking to quash, a notice issued by Seethawakapura Urban Council exercising its

powers vested in it by virtue of section 84(1) of the Urban Councils Ordinance,

ii. The basis the Court of Appeal in that case had issued a writ of certiorari was the

fact that Seethawakapura Urban Council could not have invoked the powers given

to it under section 84(1) of the Urban Councils Ordinance, as the relevant area has

admittedly been declared as an Development area by the Minister in terms of

section 3 of the UDA Law. Therefore the main thrust of the argument by the

petitioner in that case was the fact that the relevant authority should have invoked

section 28 A of the UDA Law and not section 84(1) of the Urban Councils

Ordinance, as UDA Law alone can apply in respect of any development activity

carried out in a development area.

iii. It was in those circumstances that the learned Deputy Solicitor General who had

appeared for the respondents in that case had urged that in any case, the UDA

has delegated its powers to the Chairman of the Seethawakapura Urban Council

under section 23(5) of the UDA Law. It must be observed that interpretation of

section 23(5) was not the issue in that case. The argument that the UDA has

delegated its powers to the Chairman of the Seethawakapura Urban Council under

section 23(5), has been put forward by the learned DSG in that case as a last ditch

attempt to save the notice issued by Seethawakapura Urban Council under section

84(1) of the Urban Councils Ordinance.

iv. Therefore, it is clear that the question whether the delegation of powers of UDA

with regard to planning referred to in section 23(5) of the UDA Law would include

the taking steps to enforce planning procedure in particular authority to file an

application in terms of section 28 A (1) of the UDA Law in the relevant Magistrates

Court was not the contested issue in Jayasinghes case.

10 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 10 of 20

v. The statement that the matters relating to development activities are not capable

of being delegated under the said section by His Lordship Justice Sripavan in

Jayasinghes case is a mere passing remark in reference to the above submission

of the learned DSG. The said statement is therefore not the ratio decidendi of that

case.

Be that as it may, it must be noted that the judgment in Jayasinghes case is by a single

Judge of the Court of Appeal and the judgment of Muniyandi paneer Selvam10s case is

by three-judge bench of the Supreme Court. Moreover, the ratio decidendi in the

judgment of the Supreme Court in Muniyandy paneer Selvam11s case can stand alone

independent of its reference to the judgment in Jayasinghes case. This is because His

Lordship Sripavan J has considered the other provisions in UDA Law before arriving at his

conclusion.

The said conclusion could be gathered from the ratio decidendi of the Supreme Court

judgement, which is in the following paragraph. for the reasons set out above, I hold

that the provisions contained in section 28 A (3) fall within the scope of the term

planning and therefore the powers, duties and functions referred to therein could be

delegated by the UDA to any officer of a local authority Thus, it is not necessary for

this Court to embark on an examination to ascertain whether the reference to

Jayasinghes case in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Muniyandy paneer Selvams

case is correct.

In any case, it would only require referring to few sections in the UDA Law to show that

the interpretation provided by the Supreme Court in Muniyandy paneer Selvams case is

correct.

Section 8 of the UDA Law has set out powers, and functions of the UDA. The primary

purpose of this section can be seen as conferring necessary powers on the UDA to carry

out, integrated planning and physical development within and among development areas

10 Ibid. 11 Ibid.

11 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 11 of 20

subject to any directions that may be given to the Authority by the Minister from time to

time.

This is consonant with the preamble of the Law which states that it is A law to provide

for the establishment of an Urban Development Authority to promote integrated planning

and implementation of economic, social and physical development of certain areas as

may be declared by the minister to be Urban Development Areas and for matters

connected therewith or incidental thereto.

Moreover, when considering the scheme of section 8 of the U D A Law, one can observe

that the powers and functions assigned to the UDA by the Law revolve around carrying

out integrated planning of physical development of such areas and then implementing

such planned development activities, which by law are required to be consistent with

aforesaid integrated planning. Powers to approve, co-ordinate, control, regulate any

development project or scheme of any Government agency in such areas are amongst

these powers.

According to the interpretation section12 of UDA Law, physical planning" includes the

physical and economic development of land. This clearly indicates, Physical planning "

includes physical development". Therefore, planning for the purposes of UDA Law

clearly encompasses development and hence one should not seek further reasons to

deduce that development in its common course of events encompasses development

activity. This is because development can only be done by development activities.

Section 29 of the UDA Law has also interpreted the term "development activity." It is as

follows.

" development activity " means the parcelling or sub-division of any land, the erection or

re-erection of structures and the construction of works thereon, the carrying out of

building, engineering and other operations on, over or under such land and any change

in the use for which the land or any structure thereof is used, other than the use of any

land for purposes of agriculture, horticulture and the use of any land within the curtilage

12 Section 29.

12 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 12 of 20

of a dwelling house for any purpose incidental to the enjoyment of a dwelling house, not

involving any building operation that would require the submission of a new building plan;

It is of some relevance to observe that while powers and functions of the UDA Law has

been set out under Part II of the UDA law, a new Part (Part II A) was introduced to the

Law by the UDA (Amendment) Act No. 04 of 1982. The said new Part II A has laid down

a detailed Planning Procedure.

It is under the said Planning Procedure that section 8 J states that no Government

Agency or any other person shall carry out or engage in any development activity in any

development area except under the authority, and in accordance with the terms and

conditions, of a permit issued in that behalf by the UDA. It was in that backdrop that Act

No. 04 of 1982 amended the UDA Law by inserting the definition of a new term

development activity to its interpretation section, which is section 29. Thus, the concept

of development activity for the purpose of the UDA Law is nothing but part of Planning

Procedure described in the Law.

Further, it must be borne in mind that section 28 A (3) is also a new section introduced

by UDA (Amendment) Act No. 04 of 1982 to lay down the procedure to be followed in

respect of certain development activities commenced and continued without a permit or

contrary to any term and condition of a permit. Thus, it could be seen that section 28 A

(3) has a direct bearing on sections 8 J and 8 K introduced by Act No. 04 of 1982.

Therefore, the procedure set out in section 28 A (3) is also indeed a part and parcel of

Planning Procedure. Indeed all the above new sections are found under Part II A -

Planning Procedure introduced by Act No. 04 of 1982.

Therefore, I have no hesitation to concur with the ratio decidendi of the judgment of the

Supreme Court in Muniyandy paneer Selvam13s case that the provisions contained in

section 28 A (3) fall within the scope of the term planning and therefore the powers,

duties and functions referred to therein could be delegated by the UDA to any officer of

a local authority.

13 Ibid.

13 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 13 of 20

For the above reasons, I am in full agreement with the interpretation given to section 23

(5) of the UDA Law by their Lordships in the cases cited above namely E R M Piyasena

Vs H M Wijesooriya, 14 S Sivapragasam and two others Vs Robert Jayaseelan

Perimpanayagam, Municipal Council Batticaloa and Saravanamuttu Navaneethan, Special

Commissioner, Municipal Council Batticaloa15 and Palligoda Withanage Keerthi Wimal

Withana (District Inspector Colombo Municipal Council) Vs Muniyandy paneer Selvam.16

Thus, I am of the view that the delegation of authority to the Respondent to institute the

case bearing No. 9341/5 in the Magistrates Court of Colombo has been correctly done in

accordance with section 23 (5) of the Urban Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978

as amended.

The second argument advanced by the appellant is that the Respondent has intervened

unlawfully into a dispute between the Appellant and the landlord and therefore the

application filed in the Magistrates Court by the Respondent cannot be maintained. I

would now consider the said argument.

The Appellant is admittedly occupying the alleged unlawfully constructed premises as a

tenant. It is the position of the Appellant that the said premises is a business premises

coming under the purview of the Rent Act No. 07 of 1972 as amended, as the Appellant

has been in occupation in that premises as the tenant since 1956. 17

It is in the above backdrop that the Appellant takes up the position that his landlord has

been instrumental in moving the City Planning Division of the Municipal Engineers

Department of the Colombo Municipal Council to issue a notice on the Appellant under

section 28 A (1) of the UDA Law.

The question of the application of the Rent Act to illegally constructed premises was

considered by this Court in the case of Malwattage Vs Dharmawardena.18 In the said

14 CA Application No. 119/1990 decided on 04-11-1994. 15 CA (PHC) Appeal 02/1997, decided on 16-05-2002. 16 SC Appeal No. 123/2009 decided on 13-06-2011. 17 Vide paragraph (B)(i) at page 5 of the written submissions filed by the Appellant. 18 1991 (2) Sri. L. R. 141.

14 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 14 of 20

case, the Plaintiff filed a plaint in the District Court praying inter alia for a declaration of

title to the premises in suit and an order to eject the Defendant and to demolish the

unauthorized structure standing on the land. The Defendant took up the position that she

was in fact the tenant of a house who came into its occupation under Plaintiffs father in

1965. It was therefore the position of the Defendant that the provisions of the Rent Act

would apply to prevent her ejection from the premises in suit. In the trial, it was transpired

that the father of the Plaintiff had at an earlier occasion (in 1969) had instituted action

for ejectment of the Defendant from the premises in suit and for the recovery of arrears

of rent and thereafter the mother of the Plaintiff had instituted an action for ejectment

of the Defendant from the premises in suit and for the recovery of arrears of rent in 1972.

Both those actions were subsequently withdrawn. The main point of contention in that

case was whether the alleged contract of tenancy was invalid due to the fact that the

premises in suit was constructed in contravention to the provisions of the Housing and

town Improvement Ordinance. Having considered the relevant provisions of law, His

Lordship Justice Wadugodapitiya in his judgment stated as follows.

I am in entire agreement with the submissions of learned counsel for the Respondent.

I must state here that in the circumstances, the Appellants claim to protection under the

Rent Act has no merit and must fail. An illegality cannot give rise to any such rights; nor

can the Rent Act be used to cover up and rectify an illegality under the Housing and Town

Improvement Ordinance.

It is pertinent to observe that in the instant case no one disputed the fact that the

structure in question was an unauthorized one and that there was no certificate of

conformity in respect of the said structure, which is the subject matter of the alleged

tenancy. Thus, in terms of section 15(3) of the Ordinance, both the person who actually

occupies such a structure as well as the person who allows another to occupy it, will be

guilty of an offence and will be liable to a continuing penalty not exceeding Rs. 25/- for

each day during which the contravention continues. There can be no doubt therefore,

that there is an express statutory prohibition against occupying such a building, which in

turn means that the structure in question is not one which is capable of being let under

our law. According to Dr. H W Thambiah (Landlord and Tenant in Ceylon, citing

15 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 15 of 20

Vanderlinden and Maasdorp), this is one of the essential requisites of a contract of letting

and hiring. (Pages 2 and 3). Cooper in The South African Law of Landlord and Tenant

agrees when he says: A lease like any other contract must be legal; it must not be

prohibited by statute . (Page 10).

It is relevant to note that in the instant case too, section 8 J (1) of the UDA Law states

that notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, no Government agency or any

other person shall carry out or engage in any development activity in any development

area or part thereof, except under the authority, and in accordance with the terms and

conditions, of a permit issued in that behalf by the Authority.

Further,section 8 K (2) of the UDA Law states that upon the completion of any

development activity by any person under the authority of a permit issued in that behalf,

it shall be the duty of such person to apply for and obtain a certificate of conformity from

the UDA.

According to section 8 K (3) of the Law, upon the receipt of a certificate of conformity no

land or building shall be used for any purpose other than for the purpose specified in the

permit issued in that behalf.

Moreover, UDA (Special Provisions) Act No. 44 of 1984 has introduced a new section 8 K

(4) which is as follows.

any person who occupies or allows to be occupied any building, in contravention of the

provisions of sub section (2), shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction after

summary trial before a Magistrate be liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand rupees,

and where the offence is a continuing offence to an additional fine of one hundred rupees

for each day during which such contravention continues

The above provisions show clearly that the UDA Law has also expressly prohibited the

occupation of premises constructed in contravention of its provisions. The provisions of

the Rent Act therefore cannot have any application to such premises.

16 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

Page 16 of 20

In these circumstances, I reject the argument of the Appellant that the Respondent has

intervened unlawfully into a dispute between the Appellant and the landlord and therefore

the application filed in the Magistrates Court by the Respondent cannot be maintained.

Thus, I am of the view that the Respondent could have lawfully instituted the case bearing

No. 9341/5 in the Magistrates Court of Colombo.

The third argument advanced by the Appellant is that the application of the Respondent

filed in the Magistrates Court is misconceived because it contained the prayers to convict

the Appellant under section 28 (2) of the UDA Law and impose a fine of Rs. 1000/= per

each day the Appellant continues to commit that offence. This relates to the questions of

law Nos. 5-7. It is convenient to commence the consideration of this argument with the

application made by the Respondent to the Magistrates Court.

The said application states in its caption that it is an application made under section 28

A (3) of the UDA Law. This fact is further confirmed by the several averments set out in

the said application as they show that necessary steps including the issuance of a notice

under section 28 A (1) of the UDA Law have previously been taken. According to

paragraph 5 of the said application the main prayer of the Respondent is for a mandatory

order in terms of section 28 A (3) of the UDA Law authorizing the Respondent to demolish

the unauthorized construction referred to in the sketch attached to it. Thus, there could

not have been a difficulty for the learned Magistrate to identify the said application as an

application made under section 28 A (3) of the UDA Law. Indeed the learned Magistrate

in his order has done so in no uncertain terms. Therefore, there is no ambiguity that it is

an application made under section 28 A (3) of the UDA Law.

However, it is a fact that the prayer 5(d) in the application is a prayer for an order to pay

the UDA Rs. 50,000/= under section 28(1) of the UDA Law and the prayer 5(e) in the

application is a prayer for imposing a fine of Rs. 1000/= per each day the Appellant

continues to commit this offence after conviction under section 28 (2) of the UDA Law.

Page 17 of 20

As has been correctly stated by the learned Magistrate, any conviction under section

28(1) of the UDA Law must be after a summary trial. This is also specifically mentioned

in that section.

However, it is not an exaggeration to mention here that one can, more often than not

find in any application many relief prayed from Court. This however does not mean that

Courts have any obligation to grant every such relief merely because they have been

prayed.

Looking at the application and relief prayed in the instant application, I am of the view

that prayers 5(d) and 5(e) are relief prayed in excess and are liable to be ignored. This

is because the application filed by the Respondent is clearly an application made under

section 28 A (3) of the UDA Law.

Therefore, I am of the view that the most appropriate course of action by the learned

Magistrate should have been to ignore the prayers 5(d) and 5(e) and proceed with the

main application under section 28 A (3) of the UDA Law. The learned Magistrate in the

instant case has failed to appreciate this position.

I will now consider the order made by the learned Provincial High Court Judge. It would

be of some relevance to note that the case filed before the Provincial High Court is an

application for revision. Thus, it is necessary to bear in mind that a Court exercising

revisionary powers can examine the record of any case for the purpose of satisfying itself

as to the legality or propriety of any order passed therein or as to the regularity of the

proceedings of such Court. Thus, three aspects, which a Court could consider in

revisionary proceedings, are the legality or propriety of any order and the regularity of

the proceedings.

I have already held that the course of action taken by the learned Magistrate is not the

most appropriate one. The learned Provincial High Court Judge has failed to appreciate

this position in its correct perspective. Further, the above circumstances could not have

satisfied the learned Provincial High Court Judge as to the propriety of the order of the

leaned Magistrate. Therefore, the learned Provincial High Court Judge should have

revised the order of the leaned Magistrate.

The main complaint made by the Respondent to the Court of Appeal is that the learned

Magistrate has misdirected himself and thereby erred in law by failing to give due

consideration to the main relief sought in the application namely the demolition of the

unauthorized structure in terms of section 28 A (3) of the UDA Law.

Although Her Ladyship of the Court of Appeal had not set out this position with clarity in

her judgment she had clearly referred to the fact that the learned Magistrate had taken

the view that the application of the Respondent was an application made in terms of

section 28 (3) of UDA Law. It appears to be the basis on which the Court of Appeal was

inclined to set aside both orders of the Magistrates Court and the Provincial High Court

and directed the Magistrate to hold a proper inquiry into the application of the

Respondent. Therefore, the Court of Appeal has not erred in directing the Magistrate to

hold a proper inquiry in to the application filed by the Respondents. Thus, the direction

by the Court of Appeal to the Magistrate to hold a proper inquiry in to the application

filed by the Respondents must stand.

For the above reasons, I cannot find any basis to deviate from the course of action

adopted by the Court of Appeal to set aside both the judgment of the Provincial High

Court and the judgment of the Magistrates Court.

However, the Court of Appeal appears to have stated in its judgment that the charges

are framed well within the frame work of section 28(1) of the UDA Law. It has not stated

any legal basis for the above statement. For the reasons I have already stated above, I

am of the view that the said statement is neither necessary nor warranted. Further, there

is no legal basis, which can substantiate that statement.

However, the said statements should not vitiate the judgment of the Court of Appeal as

it has correctly granted the main relief to the Respondent namely the granting of the

main relief to hold a proper inquiry into the application. In those circumstances, the

judgment of the Court of Appeal must stand altered to the above extent.

In the above circumstances, and for the foregoing reasons, I answer the questions of law

as follows.

19 SC Appeal 60 / 2017

1) The judgment of the Court of Appeal is not contrary to law and against the weight

of evidence subject to the above alteration.

2) The delegation of authority made in favour of the Respondent to institute the

action bearing No. 9341/5 in the Magistrates Court of Colombo is not bad in law

or illegal or ultra vires the provisions in section 23 (5) of the Urban Development

Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 (as amended).

3) The Respondent could have lawfully instituted the case bearing No. 9341/5 in the

Magistrates Court of Colombo.

4) The Court of Appeal did not err in directing the Magistrate to hold a proper inquiry

in to the application of the Respondent.

5) The Court of Appeal erred by holding that the section under which the Appellant

was charged by the Respondent is section 28 (1) of the Urban Development

Authority Law 04 of 1982.

6) The Court of Appeal has not failed to consider that the application to the

Magistrates Court had been made in terms of section 28 A (3) of the Urban

Development Authority Law (as amended) which is specifically to seek an order to

demolish an unauthorized construction.

7) The Court of Appeal has failed to consider that the Appellant would have to be

found guilty of an offence in a case instituted in terms of section 136 (1) of the

Criminal Procedure Code in order to impose a fine in terms of section 28 (1) or 28

(2) of the Urban Development Authority Law (as amended).

In view of the above answers I direct the learned Magistrate to treat the application of

the Respondent as an application made in terms of section 28 A (3) of the UDA Law

praying for a mandatory order in terms of that section authorizing the Respondent to

demolish the unauthorized construction more fully depicted in the sketch attached to it.

The prayers mentioned in the said application which are not falling under section 28 A

(3) of the UDA Law should be ignored.

Subject to the above variations, the direction given by the Court of Appeal to the

Magistrate to hold a proper inquiry into the application of the Respondent is affirmed.
