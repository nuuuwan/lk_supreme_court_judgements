The first petitioner is a five-year old child whose father is the second

petitioner. This court by its order dated 21 May 2019, granted leave to proceed

in this application on the alleged infringement of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

The second petitioner submitted the application dated 16 June 2018, to admit

the first petitioner to grade one at Sirimavo Bandaranayake College for the year

SCFR 21/2019

5

2019. The application was submitted under the category - children of residents

living in close proximity to the school (proximity category).

It is the contention of the second petitioner that he had been residing at the

address given in the application since his childhood and the first petitioner at the

same address, since birth. It is his contention that his mother became the legal

owner of the said premises in the year 2004. She has gifted the same premises to

the second petitioner by the deed of gift attested on 18 October 2017.

The second petitioner had submitted all necessary documentation including the

two deeds, an affidavit from the mother, birth certificates of the applicant and

the child, marriage certificate of the applicant, certificate of residence and the

extracts of the electoral register issued by the Grama Niladari. Copies of these

documents are produced before this court marked P4(a) – P4(y).

He was called for an interview before a panel comprising of the first, second and

third respondents where the first respondent was the chairperson. The board of

interview had awarded a total of 47 marks of which 03 marks were assigned

under the heading documents in proof of residency. Petitioners dispute the

marks assigned under this heading and claim that they have been denied 18.4

marks that should have been assigned under the said heading in addition to the 3

marks already assigned. They claim that the 3 marks awarded represent the

period of residence from the date on which the second petitioner became the

legal owner of the premises namely the day on which the mother of the second

petitioner gifted the premises to him. It is their contention that additional 18.4

SCFR 21/2019

6

marks should have been awarded taking in to account the 13 year time period in

which the mother of the second petitioner remained the legal owner of the

premises in which the second petitioner resided.

It is their contention that the circular relating to school admissions for the year

2019 makes provision for the same. They further contend that if those 18.4

marks were awarded the total marks awarded to the petitioners would be 65.4

and thereby would have qualified to be admitted. The cutoff marks for the school

they applied was 60.2.

Being aggrieved with the decision of the board of interview, the petitioners

presented an appeal on 21 November 2018. The second petitioner presented

himself before the Appeal and Objection Investigation Board comprising of the

4th Respondent and another member whose identity is unknown to him.

However, the second petitioner claims that he was not informed of the decision

of the said appeal board.

Petitioners submit that the refusal to admit the 1st petitioner to Sirimavo

Bandaranayake Vidyalaya is illegal, unreasonable, unlawful, arbitrary,

discriminatory and contrary to the relevant circular.

The first respondent who is the principal of the school and the chairperson of the

interview board contends that the petitioners were correctly awarded 3 marks

for the Deed of the property which the second petitioner had been the owner of,

for a period between six months to one year. It is her further contention that

SCFR 21/2019

7

there is no provision in the relevant circular to add marks for the previous

ownership of the property.

The fifth respondent who was the Secretary to the Ministry of Education

contended that the school authorities have correctly awarded 3 marks for the

deed of the property of which the second petitioner had been the owner of, for a

period more than six months and less than one year. Further he contends that

there is no provision in the relevant circular to add marks taking into account the

previous ownership of the property. He further contended that the Admission

circular issued in the year 2013 permitted the aggregation of the period of

previous ownership of the property by the grandparent of the child in situations

where the parent of the child had owned the property for less than three years.

Further he contends that the notice issued by the Ministry of Education relating

to school admissions in the year 2020 had re-introduced the aggregation of the

period of previous ownership by the grandparent of the child.

The mark sheet in respect of the school admission application of the petitioners

is marked P6 and R3. They are in two different formats. However, both these

documents confirm that the petitioners were awarded 3 marks under the

heading “documents confirming residency”.

The relevant circular relating to school admissions for the year, namely Circular

24/2018 of the Ministry of Education (hereinafter referred to as the Circular) is

produced marked P2 and R1.

Petitioners in this application claim that additional 18.4 marks under sub clause

(ii) of clause 7.2.1.1 should have been awarded to their application. It is their

contention that these marks should have been awarded for the transfer deed no.

1232 attested on 24 November 2004. This deed had been made by the National

Housing Development Authority in favour of the mother of the second petitioner

conveying the ownership of the premises to the latter. Thirteen years thereafter

the ownership was transferred to the second petitioner through a deed of gift

that was attested on 18 October 2017. Three marks were awarded to the

SCFR 21/2019

10

petitioners under sub clause (i) of clause 7.2.1.1 in relation to the said deed of

gift.

The respondents contend that they awarded 3 marks to the Deed of Gift under

which the second petitioner acquired lawful ownership. They further submit that

no marks were awarded to the aforesaid Deed of Transfer through which the

mother of the second petitioner gained lawful ownership. It is their contention,

that no such aggregation of marks is permitted under the Circular. They contend

that marks can be awarded to deeds falling under one of the two sub categories

only.

The core issue that has to be considered in this application is whether the failure

to award marks for the deed of transfer which confirmed the lawful ownership of

the mother of the second petitioner from 2004 to 2017 is contrary to the circular

and therefore is arbitrary and / unreasonable and / irrational.

In deciding this issue, it is important to examine the whole circular with a view to

comprehend the rationale and the object and the purpose of the whole scheme

provided thereunder. An interpretation of any specific individual Rule or Rules

needs to be guided by the findings of such an examination.

According to the Circular, six different categories have been recognised under

which the applications could be submitted. A common factor applicable to all six

categories is that the parents or the legal guardian should reside in the “feeder

SCFR 21/2019

11

area” of the relevant school. Therefore “Residency” of the applicants has an

important bearing in the ultimate decision to admit a child under the Circular.

Clause 3.1 of the Circular recognises “Children of the residents living in close

proximity to school” as one of such categories relating to school admissions

(proximity category). Clause 7.1 (i) of the circular provides that, fifty percent of

the vacancies should be filled by the applicants who come under proximity

category. Clause 7.2 set out the different criteria under which marks should be

awarded when applications under proximity category is considered. Clause 7.2.1

recognises two categories of documents that can be considered in proof of

residency. The two categories recognised therein are “the main documents” and

“additional documents”. Further, the circular sets out the maximum marks that

can be assigned to the acceptable documents under each category. Actual marks

that can be awarded in a given situation is determined in accordance with the

percentage of marks that can be assigned out of the maximum marks based on

the ‘age’ of the document. One hundred percent is assigned for documents which

are five years or older from the closing date of the applications. The lowest

percentage namely, five percent is assigned to the documents less than 6 months

old. Documents between 6 moths to one year old attract ten percent of the

assigned maximum marks. The above scheme as recognised by the Circular

therefore mainly focuses on the duration of residency in deciding the actual

marks that will be awarded to an applicant. The focus is on the five year period

immediately prior to the last date of submitting applications. An applicant who

proves residency for five or more years will receive the maximum of one

hundred percent marks for the documents proving residency.

SCFR 21/2019

12

Documents proving residency are divided into two categories namely “main” and

“additional” documents. Clause 7.2.1.1 set out the type of documents that are

considered “main” documents proving residency. It recognizes, interalia Deeds of

transfer and Deeds of gift as “main” documents confirming residency. These

main documents are further divided into two sub-categories based on the person

in whose benefit such documents have been executed. A description of these two

sub categories are found in sub clauses (i) and (ii) of clause 7.2.1.1. Further the

said sub clauses set out the maximum marks that can be assigned under each of

these two sub categories. First sub - category described under sub clause (i) of

clause 7.2.1.1 is the documents that are in the name of the applicant or the

spouse of the applicant. Maximum of 30 marks can be awarded to the documents

that would fall under the said sub category. The second sub category recognised

under sub clause (ii) of clause 7.2.1.1. is, the documents that are in the name of

either of the parents of either the applicant or the spouse of the applicant.

Maximum of 23 marks is assigned for the documents under this category.

It is pertinent to note that the circular has no specific provision either

prohibiting or allowing the aggregation of marks that can be awarded for the

documents that would fall under the two sub categories of documents

recognised under sub clauses (i) and (ii) of clause 7.2.1.1.

When the objective of clause 7.2 is considered in its context, it is clear that the

said clause set out the criteria under which school admissions will be made

under the proximity category. The prime focus under this category is the place of

SCFR 21/2019

13

residence of an applicant. The circular recognizes two types of documents that

can be taken into account in proof of place of residence. They are the “main

documents” and “additional documents”. While clause 7.2.1.1. describes

different types of documents that will be considered as “main documents” sub

clauses (i) and (ii) of the said clause determine the maximum marks that can be

assigned to such documents depending on the person under whose name, such

document exists. The actual marks that can be awarded is determined according

to the different percentages of the maximum marks prescribed to each category,

based on the age of the document. Further, the same clause specifically excludes

assigning any marks to documents made in favour of any person other than the

categories recognised under sub clauses (i) and (ii). Therefore, to qualify to

receive any marks for a document that can be classified as a “main document”

such document should be in the name of the applicant, the spouse of the

applicant, mother or father of the applicant or the mother or father of the spouse

of the applicant (hereinafter referred to as “accepted parties”). The actual marks

will depend on two factors. Namely, first the person in whose name the

document exists, and second the age of the document. It is clear that the detailed

scheme of marks will ensure that a maximum of 30 marks will be awarded to an

applicant who produces a “main document” that is five years or older in the

name of the applicant or the spouse of the applicant. Lowest of 1.15 marks will

be awarded to an applicant who produces a “main document” that is less than 6

months old which is in the name of either of the parents of the applicant or the

spouse of the applicant.

SCFR 21/2019

14

The over all scheme set out above ensures that marks are assigned on a

reasonable scale when the proof of residency is considered, under the proximity

category. It is pertinent to emphasise that the core factor in this category is the

“residency” of the applicant and the threshold maximum period of residency

considered is five years prior to the closing date of the applications. The scheme

set out above clearly accepts the residency at premises belonging either to the

applicant or the spouse or either parents of the applicant or the spouse.

Therefore if an applicant had been residing at premises belonging to a parent of

either the applicant or the spouse and had continued to reside in the same

premises after it was transferred to the applicant or the spouse should have the

benefit of receiving marks covering the full term of residency. Depriving any

marks due to the change of lawful ownership between the “accepted parties” will

not only be arbitrary but also causes grave prejudice to an applicant.

The second petitioner had resided in the premises since his childhood along with

his parents. In the year 2004, the mother of the second petitioner had become

the lawful owner of the same premises by the Deed 1232 dated 24 November

2004. Thirteen years therefrom she had transferred the lawful ownership of the

premises to the second petitioner by the Deed of Gift executed on 18 October

2017. Therefore during the immediate prior five year period from the closing

date of applications namely between 1st July 2013 and 30th June 2018, the

second petitioner who is the applicant and his mother had been the lawful

owners of the premises for periods of eight months and four years and four

moths respectively. There has been no interruption on the legal ownership of the

premises other than the transfer between the second petitioner and his mother.

SCFR 21/2019

15

It is also pertinent to observe that the Petitioners would have been awarded with

23 marks for “main documents” if no change of ownership took place between

the mother and the second petitioner and continued to remain with the mother

of the second petitioner.

Therefore, in my view the contention that no aggregation of marks is possible in

situations where the lawful ownership had changed between “accepted parties”

(change between parents and grand parents of the child) without a specific

provision permitting such aggregation, is not only contrary to the whole scheme

relating to the proximity category set out under the Circular but also causes

prejudice to such applicants.

I have considered the Judgment of this Court in S.M.N.S. Thilakaratne and

another v M.W.D.T.P Wanasinghe and others (SC FR 30/18, SC minutes of

28.05.2019). In the said Judgment one of the issues that had been considered is

whether the denial to award marks for a title deed in the name of the father of

the applicant was in violation of the Circular 22/2017. The Court did not accept

the Petitioner’s contention that marks should have been awarded to the deed,

which was in the name of the father in addition to the marks assigned to the deed

in her name. The Court reached this decision based on two factors. First that the

circular 22/2017 speaks only of “one person” when it says that, if five or more

years have lapsed between the date of the deed on which the deed relating to

proof of residency has been made in the name of the “relevant person” full marks

should be awarded. Second, that “it (the circular) impliedly indicates that the

relevant person aforementioned is the person who holds the relevant document in

SCFR 21/2019

16

his/her name as at the final date given to tender applications”. I further observe

that the language in both these Circulars – Circular 22/2017 and Circular

24/2018 are similar in relation to the documents in proof of residency.

However, it is accepted law that a “classification must be reasonable, not

arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and

substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly

circumstanced and shall be treated alike” [Royster Guano Co v Commonwealth of

Virginia – 1920-253 US 412 at 415 cited with approval in Haputhantirige and

Others v Attorney-General [2007] 1 SLR 101 at 117]. It is further held, that a

Court should consider the object of the relevant law and whether a classification

could be related to reasonably achieving such object, when the Court has to

consider if any classification violates the principle of equality. Similar views are

expressed by this Court in M.K.Wijethunga & two others v the Principal,

Southlands College [SC FR 612/2004, Decided on 07.11.2005, 2005 B.L.R 19at

22]

On examination of the scheme and the scope of these Circulars, it is clear that one

of the categories under which an application for admission to grade one can be

made is the “proximity category”. For an applicant to succeed under this category

it is essential to prove his or her residency. Title deeds of premises is one type of

document that can be submitted to establish such residency. These deeds

interalia are considered “main documents establishing the residency”. However,

the marking scheme further classifies these type of documents based on two

main factors. First the time period of residency that can be establish through

SCFR 21/2019

17

these deeds and secondly the person under whose name, such deeds are made.

One such classification made is the documents that establish residency for five or

more years. Documents falling within this classification will attract one hundred

percent of the marks assigned. Marks assigned are scaled down depending on

the time period and the minimum percentage of five percent is awarded for

documents that are valid for a period of less than 6 months, as at the date of

closing applications. The other factor taken into account is the person in whose

name such deed is made. Distinction made under this classification is between

the applicant or his spouse and either of the parents of the applicant or the

spouse. Different marks are assigned to these two groups. As provided under

Circular 24/2018, a maximum of 30 marks to the documents in the name of the

applicant of the spouse and a maximum of 23 marks for the documents in the

name of either of the parents of the applicant or the spouse. In addition, a

further classification made under the said clause is the total exclusion of

documents that are in the name of any person other than the persons who are

recognised under (i) and (ii) of clause 7.2.1.1.

All these classifications specifically recognised under clause 7.2.1 of the Circular

reasonably achieves the over all object of provisions relating to the applications

submitted under the “proximity” category. The duration of residency as well as

the person in whose name the main document to establish residency are criteria

based on which a reasonable classification can be made in assigning marks.

However a further classification restricting these marks, defeats the overall

objective of the scheme set out in the selection process relating to applicants

who come under the “proximity” category.

SCFR 21/2019

18

Examination of the Mark sheet relating to the Petitioner, which is produced

marked R3, clearly reflects that provision is made to assign marks under three

broad headings. They are (i) Registration in the voters list to establish residency,

(ii) Documents establishing residency and (iii) Proximity to the school from the

place of residence. Under heading (i) the period that has to be considered is the

five-year period from 2013 to 2017. The applicant had been awarded full marks

assigned under the heading Registration in the voters list (25 marks) as he had

proved that the names of the applicant and the spouse was registered covering

the entire period of 2013 to 2017. The fact that the applicant had been awarded

full marks under heading (i) above is indicative of the fact that the Petitioners

had been resident at the address in question since 2013. Under the second

heading – Documents establishing residence – one sub category is Ownership of

the place of residence. This sub category is further divided into two sub

categories namely Deeds written in the name of the applicant or the spouse and

the deeds written in the name of the Mother or Father of the Applicant or Spouse.

These two sub categories are recognised as independent from each other. They

are not set out as alternate sub categories. Petitioners had been awarded 03

marks for the deed in the second petitioner’s name that had been made on 18

October 2017. This is the Deed of Gift made by the Mother of the second

petitioner. This deed is produced marked P-4(b)(ii). However, no marks have

been awarded under the subcategory - deeds made in the name of mother or

father of the applicant or the spouse.

SCFR 21/2019

19

In my view assigning marks under the sub category “Ownership of the place of

residence” coming under the heading “Documents establishing residence” must

be considered in the backdrop of the chain of events that had taken place relating

to the title of the property during the relevant period – the immediate past five

year period from the closing date for applications. By the execution of the deed of

gift in favour of the second petitioner in 2017 his right to occupy the premises at

the given address was not diminished but on the contrary enhanced.

Hypothetically if the deed of gift was not executed, the Petitioner would have

been entitled to full marks assigned under the sub category “deeds in the name

of the mother or father of the applicant or the spouse”. Thus it would seem

artificial to deprive the marks that ought to have been assigned to the applicant

because of the intervening act of executing the deed that enhanced the rights of

the petitioner and the opportunity to occupy the house, now as the owner.

It is pertinent to note that the paper notice relating to school admissions for the

year 2020 which was produced marked R2 makes a specific provision for

aggregation of marks in situations where a transfer of ownership had taken place

between the accepted parties within the immediately preceding five year period

from the closing date of applications. Presumably, the reason for aggregation of

marks was made possible in the 2020 school admission circular, would have

been to eliminate the injustice that might result from a situation of this nature.

For the reasons I have enumerated hereinbefore the denial of any marks to the

Deed of Transfer made by the National Housing Development Authority in the

SCFR 21/2019

20

name of the mother of the applicant on 24th November 2004, which is produced

marked P-4(b)(i) fail to achieve the object of the Circular. Further the said denial

is contrary to the object and purpose of the circular as well as the scheme of

marks developed for the proximity category Such denial in my view is arbitrary,

unfair and unreasonable. It defeats the purpose of the whole scheme developed

by the Circular.

This Court in, Karunathilaka and another v Jayalath de Silva and others,

[2003] 1 SLR 35 at 41-42 held “The basic principle governing the concept of

equality is to remove unfairness and arbitrariness. It profoundly forbids actions,

which deny equality and thereby becomes discriminative. The hallmark of the

concept of equality is to ensure that fairness is meted out.”

Under these circumstances I hold that the failure to award marks to the deed of

transfer reflecting the lawful ownership of the mother of the second petitioner is

a violation of Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the constitution.

Therefore the denial to assign marks on the deed in the name of the mother of

the second petitioner is a violation of the Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1)

of the Constitution.

This court appreciate that the hands of the Respondents were tied to an extent

with regard to the assigning marks in the absence of any guidelines as to how

marks should be assigned in a scenario of this nature.

SCFR 21/2019

21

In granting relief to the Petitioners, I am mindful of the fact that the application

was submitted to admit the first petitioner to grade one at Sirimavo

Bandaranayake Vidyalaya, Colombo 7 for the year 2019. The academic year

2019 had already come to an end. Therefore it is just and equitable to direct the

first respondent – the Principal of Sirimavo Bandaranayake Vidyalaya, Colombo

7 - to admit the first petitioner to the second grade of Sirimavo Bandaranayake

Vidyalaya, Colombo 7 forthwith, enabling the first petitioner to commence her

education at the said school without further delay.

Taking into account the importance of the subject matter in relation to this

application namely, the education of a child and the need to ensure that no unfair

or unnecessary disruption is caused on any child’s education, the Registrar is

directed to send copies of this Judgment to the Principal of Sirimavo

Bandaranayake Vidyalaya, Stanmore Crescent Colombo 7 and the Secretary of

the Ministry of Education, Isurupaya, Pelawatte, Battaramulla for appropriate

steps. The Honourable Attorney-General is directed to provide necessary advise

to the relevant state authorities to ensure that necessary steps are taken to give

effect to this judgment, without any delay.

I had the advantage of reading in draft, the Judgment written by His Lordship the

Chief Justice. With all due respect to his lordship’s analysis of facts and

conclusions, I intend to dissent and come to a different conclusion with regard to

the facts revealed before us in this case. Since his lordship has summarized the

facts of this case, I need not repeat some of them here again.

His lordship has referred to the judgment of this court in S.M.N.S. Thilakaratne

and another M.W.D.T.P. Wanasinghe and others (SC FR 30/18, SC minutes of

28.05.2019) which was decided in relation to the Circular 22/2017. The Circular

relevant to the case at hand is Circular 24/2018 of the Ministry of Education

which is marked as P2. The relevant provisions in Circular 24/2018 in relation to

the main documents in proof of residency are similar to the provisions in

relation to documents in proof of residency discussed in the aforesaid case in

relation to Circular 22/2017.

The document marked as R1 which seems to be the Circular relevant to school

admissions in 2013 indicates that there were specific instructions in the past

when there was a change of ownership from Grand Parent to the Applicant

Parent. As per the instructions given in R1, it appears that the policy of the

Ministry of Education at that time was not to aggregate the ownership of the

parent and the grand parent of the child to be admitted in giving marks for the

documents in proof of residency, but to consider the total period of ownership as

SCFR 21/2019

23

that of the grand parent if the ownership of the parent of the child was less than

3 years or else if the ownership of the parent of the child was more than 3 years

not to consider the period of ownership of the grand parent. However, it appears

that with the change of policy such instructions were taken away from the

circulars relating to 2017 and 2018. There was no indication that such

instructions were taken away to provide for the aggregation of the ownership of

the parent and the grand parent. It should also be noted that the policy existed

prior to the said circulars as mentioned above, was not for the aggregation of

ownership. In that backdrop, I find it difficult to find fault with the Respondents,

who had to interpret the Circular 24/2018 which does not have instructions

how to give marks when there is a change of ownership from a grand parent to a

parent, when they interpret relevant provisions as per the plain language used in

the said circular.

As per the clauses 7.2.1 and 7.2.1.1 of the said Circular 24/2018, which provides

a marking scheme for the documents in proof of residency in a similar manner to

the clauses 7.2.2 and 7.2.2.1 of Circular 22/2017 discussed in the aforesaid case

S.M.N.S.Thilakarathne and Another V M.W.D.T.P. Wanasinghe, marks are

given for the deeds or documents that proves the title or entitlement of the

relevant person to the place of residence. A careful reading of the relevant

clauses indicates that the relevant person referred to above has to be one of the

following persons:

 The applicant (one of the Parents or Legal Guardian)

 The spouse of the applicant

 The father or mother of the applicant

 The father or mother of the applicant’s spouse.

SCFR 21/2019

24

The clause 7.2.1 of Circular 24/2018 allocates marks for the documentary proof

of title or entitlement in the following manner;

 If the document in proof of residency shows the title or

entitlement of the relevant person to the place of residence for five

years or more as at the final date given to tender applications –

Full marks (100%).

 If it is less than five years and more than four years—80% of the

full marks.

 If it is less than four years and more than three years – 60% of the

full marks.

 If it is less than three years and more than two years – 40% of the

full marks.

 If it is less than two years and more than one year – 20% of full the

marks.

 If it is less than one year and more than six months - 10% of the

full marks.

 If it is less than six months - 05%

As per the said clauses 7.2.1.1 of Circular 24/2018, the maximum one can gain

under the heading ‘Main Documents in Proof of Residency’ is 30 marks. However,

when one reads clause 7.2.1 with clause 7.2.1.1 (i), and (ii), it is clear that;

 If the ownership or entitlement to the place of residence is in the

name of the applicant/spouse, the applicant can gain the maximum

of 30 marks subject to the percentages referred to above in

relation to the period of ownership.

SCFR 21/2019

25

 If the ownership or entitlement is in the name of the

mother/father of the applicant/spouse, the applicant can gain only

23 marks out of the maximum of 30 marks, which is further

subject to the percentages referred to above in relation to the

period of ownership.

 If the applicant's residency is based on a registered leasehold right

or as an occupant of a government quarter or as a tenant under the

Rent Act, the applicant can gain only 12 marks out of the maximum

30 marks subject to the percentages referred to above in relation

to his entitlement to the residential property.

The Petitioner’s contention is that marks should have been considered under

clause 7.2.1.1 (ii) for the 2nd Petitioner’s mother’s deed and the Respondents

failed to give marks for the said deed. However, I cannot find fault with the

Respondents since the plain reading of clause 7.2.1 gives marks to the document

in proof of residency which is in the name of the relevant person. It contemplates

only one relevant person and not many. In the instant case, it is the Petitioner not

her predecessors in title.

Furthermore, as per the clause 7.2.1, to give marks time is counted from the date

the ownership or entitlement was transferred to the name of the relevant person

to the final date given to tender applications. Since the time is counted until the

final date given for applications, it impliedly indicates that the relevant person

aforementioned is the person who holds the relevant document in his/her name

as at the final date given to tender applications. The mother of the 2nd Petitioner,

SCFR 21/2019

26

the predecessor in title, did not hold the ownership in her name at the final date

given to tender applications, since she gifted her right to the 2nd Petitioner by

executing deed marked as P4(b)(1). Therefore, it is my view that the

Respondents cannot be blamed for not giving marks for the deed in the name of

the predecessor in title since the plain reading of the relevant clause does not

warrant to consider further marks for the deed of the predecessor in title as she

was not the relevant person who held the title as at the final date given to tender

the applications. On the other hand, there is no allegation that for any of the

applicants, marks were given for his/her or his/her spouse’s title documents as

well as for the title documents of the father/mother of the applicant or his

spouse causing discrimination.

It is now revealed that the Ministry of Education has again amended the Policy

for the year 2020 allowing aggregation of the period of ownership of the Parent

with the ownership of the grand parent when there is a change of ownership -

Vide R2. Such a benefit was not there for the Respondents of this case when they

consider the application of the Petitioners. Hence, I cannot hold that there is a

violation of fundamental rights of the Petitioners by the Respondents since they

have given a possible literal Interpretation to the relevant clauses.
