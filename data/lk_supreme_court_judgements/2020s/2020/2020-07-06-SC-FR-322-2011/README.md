Argued on : 13.01.2020

Decided on : 06.07.2020

Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, CJ

There are thirty-four Petitioners in this matter. In the year 1999, they along with several others

were recruited to the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports as Graduate Trainees. Approximately

ten thousand persons had been recruited under the said programme. Those recruits had been

posted to different departments under different Ministries. The Petitioners in this application,

thirty-four in number, were functioning as Career Guidance Officers attached to the Ministry of

Productivity Promotion at the time of filing this application (13 September 2011).

In the year 2000, the Petitioners had been issued with letters of appointment to the post of

“Career Guidance Officer” and were placed at the salary scale of Rs. 72,600 – 14x1560 -

3x2,460 - 106,740. Three years thereafter, in 2003, they had been confirmed in the said post.

From 25th April 2006, the Petitioners had been placed at the salary scale MN4 in accordance with

the Public Administration Circular No. 6 of 2006. At that stage, the Petitioners were attached to

the Ministry of Labour Relations and Foreign Employment. On 10.05.2006 the Secretary of the

aforesaid Ministry had written to the Chairman of the National Salaries and Cadres Commission

seeking guidance as to the appropriate salary scale and the step in which the Petitioners should

be placed on. Thereafter in December 2006 the same Secretary had recommended to the

Secretary Ministry of Public Administration that the Petitioners be placed at the salary scale

MN6. However, three years thereafter on 27 March 2009, the same Secretary had informed the

Association to which the Petitioners belonged to, that the Salaries and Cadres Commission has

not approved a salary revision and therefore, there is no provision to place the petitioners in the

scale MN5. The salary scale approved to the Petitioners is MN4. Petitioners contend that they

should have been placed at the salary scale of MN6 instead of MN4. In the year 2010, a new

Department called Department of Manpower and Employment had been established under the

Ministry of Labour Relations and Manpower and the petitioners were absorbed in to the newly

established Department. At the time of establishing the new department, Department of

Management Services on 09.02.2010, had approved the cadre positions on the recommendations

of the National Salaries and Cadres Commission in the newly established department.

SCFR No. 322/2011

12

Thereafter in June 2010, the Secretary Ministry of Labour Relations had sought the approval of

the Department of the Management Services to suppress 38 existing positions of Career

Guidance Officers and to create thirty-eight Supra Grade positions and to place the petitioners at

the salary scale MN7. However, The Salaries and Cadres Commission had not recommended

creating Supra Grade positions. They had observed that the officers who are currently in service

could be absorbed into a structured grading system and that thereby more responsibilities can be

attached to the officers who would be absorbed into higher grades. The Petitioners contend that

the said decision of the National Salaries and Cadres Commission is arbitrary, capricious,

unreasonable and discriminatory. They further contend that the said decision amounts to an

infringement of their fundamental right to equality as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

Petitioners pray, that the aforesaid decision of the Salaries and Carders Commission be declared

null and void and of no force or avail in law. They further seek an Order directing the Director

General (Establishments) and the members of the National Salaries and Cadres Commission to

recommend to the public Service Commission to create and or to make order that the Petitioners

are entitled to be promoted to the Supra Grade carrying the salary scale of MN7. They further

seek an Order of this Court directing the Respondents to place Petitioners at the salary scale

MN6 pending the creation of Supra Grade or in the alternative to place Petitioners at the salary

scale MN6 or any other salary scale that the Court may consider fit and proper.

The Petitioners’ plea for theses reliefs is based on two main grounds. First they contend that

they are assigned with duties and in fact they do perform such duties that are similar to the duties

assigned to those officers who are placed in the MN7 salary scale. Second, they claim that those

other recruits who were recruited initially under the same programme along with the Petitioners

– the Graduate Trainee Programme – and assigned to other Departments and Ministries are now

functioning in different capacities placed at the salary scale of MN7. It is their contention that

therefore the failure to create a Supra Grade and place them in MN7 salary scale is

discriminatory.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General who represented all the Respondents submitted that the

Petitioners’ claim is misconceived in law. It is her contention that the decision not to recommend

suppression of existing thirty eight positions in the relevant Department and create thirty eight

supra grade positions to facilitate petitioners to be placed at salary scale MN7 is in accordance

SCFR No. 322/2011

13

with the established rules and practices and reflect the actual need in the relevant Department.

The Co-Chairman of the National Pay Commission – the twenty ninth Respondent - contends

that the entitlement to a particular salary scale in the public service is mainly dependent on the

basic qualifications required for the particular post and not based on any qualifications acquired

by an individual officer while in service. Such factors as well as the success at the Efficiency Bar

examinations will be taken into account in situations of either confirmation or promotions. It is

further contended that the duties of the Career Guidance Officers cannot be equated with the

duties assigned to Project Officers and therefore they belong to two different categories. Further,

the two schemes of recruitments in relation to these two categories are different to each other.

Petitioners through their counter affidavits have reiterated their initial positions.

An examination of all the material placed before this Court establishes that the Petitioners who

possessed under graduate degrees were initially appointed as trainees in the year 1999. They

were not recruited through a competitive examination. They had been assigned to the Ministry of

Samurdi, Youth Affairs and Sports. It is reasonable to conclude that the co-recruits who were

recruited under the same scheme along with the petitioners would have been assigned to different

ministries. They were initially placed on a one-year trainee period and thereafter they were to be

appointed to a permanent position within the respective ministry if they successfully complete

the relevant training and the aptitude test.

The Circular issued by the Secretary of Finance in July 2000, regulates the appointment of those

trainees to the permanent posts. (P9). This was issued to interalia all Secretaries and Heads of

Departments. According to the said circular the basic salary scale set out had been Rs 72,600 -

14x1560 – 5x2460 – 1,06,740. However, this circular further recommends to select trainees with

higher qualifications and skills through a structured interview if they are to be appointed to posts

which have salary scales greater than the aforesaid.

In October 2000, when the Petitioners were appointed to the post of Career Guidance Officer,

they were placed at the salary scale 72,600 – 1,560 x14 – 2,460x3 – 1,06,740/-(P11). In the

scheme of recruitment issued two years later - in 2002 - for the post of Career Guidance Officer

the same salary scale had been prescribed (P10). I observe that the initial salary scale of a staff

grade officer at that stage was Rs. 74,160/. Therefore, the Petitioners had at no stage been placed

at a salary scale of Staff Grade Officers. It is pertinent to note that the Petitioners do not raise any

concern over the salary scale that they were placed in when they were appointed to the post of

SCFR No. 322/2011

14

Career Guidance Officers in the year 2000. They do not raise any concern regarding the salary

scale prescribed in the scheme of recruitment formulated two years thereafter – in 2002.

The decision Petitioners are challenging, through these proceedings, is the decision of the

National Salaries and Cadres Commission not to recommend the suppression of thirty-eight

existing positions and creating a similar number of Supra Grade positions. This decision is

reflected in the letter, dated 09.09.2010 (P32). It is pertinent to note that the decision so

challenged observes that the current officers can be absorbed in to a structured graded system

having prepared a scheme of recruitment in compliance with the Public Administration Circular

06/2006 and thereby attach more responsibilities to officers who would be absorbed in to higher

grades. I further observe, that the Salaries and Cadre Commission in the same document had

expressed the view that it is more appropriate to take a decision on this matter after taking into

account the instructions in the circular issued pursuant to the Cabinet decision approving the

proposal of the Minister of Finance submitted on 20 July 2010 to establish a scheme of transfer

in addressing the concerns of the graduate trainees recruited by the Government (paragraphs 03

and 04 of P-32).

I am of the view that the impugned decision and the views expressed therein, should be

considered in the context of the changes that had taken place between the year 2000 and 2010

namely the time of appointment of the petitioners to the relevant post and the date of impugned

decision. In the year 2006, through the Public Administration Circular No 06 dated 25 April

2006, Salaries in the Public Service were restructured based on the Budget Proposals presented

in the same year. This circular sets out the basis and criteria that need to be adopted in the

conversion of salaries as provided therein. It is admitted that the Petitioners were placed at the

salary scale MN4. This conversion has been made in accordance with the said Circular in

correspondence to the salary scale on which they were placed in at the time the Circular came

into operation. However, the Petitioners contend that they should have been placed in the scale

MN6 instead of MN4.

It is pertinent to note that the salary conversion placing them in the scale MN4 took place in

2006 and they have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court through these proceedings only in the

SCFR No. 322/2011

15

year 2011. The Petitioners claim that they entertained a legitimate expectation that they would be

placed at salary scale MN7 at a subsequent stage. The basis for the Petitioners claim that they

had a legitimate expectation that they would be placed at a salary scale higher than MN4 is two

fold. First they claim that by being provided special training enabling them with the necessary

skills to perform their duties when promoted, had given rise to a legitimate expectation.

Secondly, duties they were performing were equivalent to the duties of a field officer as well as a

staff grade officer and thereby they entertained a legitimate expectation.

It is settled law that infringing a legitimate expectation of an individual by an executive or

administrative decision could lead to a violation of the Right to equality guaranteed by Article

12(1) of the Constitution. In Dayarathna and others v Minister of Health and Indigenous

Medicine (1999) 1 SLR 393, His Lordship Amarasinghe, J observed that ,

“ It is the duty of this Court to safeguard the rights and privileges, as well as interests

deserving of protection such as those based on legitimate expectations, of individuals”

(supra at p 413).

His Lordship Priyantha Jayawardane PC J in G.M. Nimalasiri v Colonel P.P.J. Fernando et al.

(SC FR 256/2010, SC minutes of 17th September 2015) cited with approval Dayarthna (supra)

and with reference to the doctrine of legitimate expectation held that,

“It arises from establishing an expectation believing an undertaking or promise given by

a public official or establishing an expectation taking into consideration of established

practice of an authority”.

His Lordship Prasanna Jayawardane PCJ, in Ariyaratne et al. v Illangakoon et al. (SC FR

444/2012, SC minutes of 30th July 2019 at pp 56-57), observed that

“the first characteristic which will sustain a petitioner’s claim that he has a substantive

legitimate expectation the respondent public authority will act in a particular manner with

regard to him, is that the petitioner must establish the public authority gave him a

specific, un ambiguous and unqualified assurance that it will act in that manner [or,

SCFR No. 322/2011

16

alternatively, that the respondent public authority has followed an established and

unambiguous practice which entitled the petitioner to have a legitimate expectation the

public authority will continue to act in that manner or that the facts and circumstances of

the dealings between the public authority and the petitioner have created such an

expectation]”,

The impugned decision (P32) clearly sets out the reasons and the basis for the decision not to

recommend the suppression of existing posts and creating Supra Grade posts, at that stage. The

Salaries and Cadres Commission had observed that the Cabinet had approved to establish a

transfer scheme for graduate employees in the public sector. Such approval was granted having

considered the proposal submitted by the Minister of Finance in July 2010 to address the

concerns relating to them. The Salaries and Cadres Commission has expressed the view that it is

more appropriate to take a decision on the proposal to suppress existing posts and creating Supra

Grade posts after taking into account the instructions in the circular that would be issued in

giving effect to the transfer scheme referred to hereinbefore. The Salaries and Cadres

Commission has recommended to develop a scheme of recruitment in line with the Circular

6/2006 taking into account the cabinet decision dated 18.11.2009 which approved the creation of

the department in which the Petitioners serve. It is their view that such process will provide an

opportunity to assign more responsibilities based on seniority and will create an environment to

enjoy a scheme of structured unhindered promotions. It is pertinent to note, that this Court had

observed that

“PA Circular No. 6/2006, which deals with the Budget proposals is not a document

prepared merely for the purpose of increasing the salary of government employees. On

the contrary, the said document had been prepared for the purpose of restructuring the

Public Service salaries based on Budget proposals for 2006.”…. “By these proposals, (as

stated by the 5th respondent), 126 different salary scales that had existed previously had

been reduced to 37”. – Her Ladyship Dr Shirani A Bandaranayake CJ in Akarawita et al

v Dr Nanda Wickramasinghe, SC FR 320/2007, SC minutes of 02.11.2010.

The impugned decision taken in the context of the observations and recommendations of the

Salaries and Cadres Commission as reflected in the letter dated 09.09.2010 (P32) demonstrates

SCFR No. 322/2011

17

that the decision in question is rational and reasonable. In my view it addresses the concerns and

requirements of the officers concerned, interests of the Department they serve as well as the

overall policy regarding the public sector. All these interests had been taken into consideration in

making the recommendations therein. Therefore, I am unable to hold that the impugned decision

is unreasonable and / or capricious and / or arbitrary.

It is important to note,

“a mere hope or an expectation cannot be treated as having a legitimate expectation”,

Siriwardane v Seneviratne and 4 others ([2011] 2 SLR 1 at p 7).

In Siriwardane (supra at p 8) Her Ladyship Dr Shirani A Bandaranayake J, further observed

“A careful consideration of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, clearly shows that,

whether an expectation is legitimate or not is a question of fact. This has to be decided

not only on the basis of the application made by the aggrieved party before court, but also

taking into consideration whether there had been any arbitrary exercise of power by the

administrative authority in question”.

Petitioners contend that the documents produced marked P28, P29 and P24 reflect that the

respondents ‘held out a promise’ that the Petitioners would be placed on a higher salary scale.

This court observes that the document marked P29 contains a proposal submitted by the

Secretary of the Labour Relations Ministry, to suppress 38 posts of Career Guidance Officers

and create 38 Supra Grade positions. P28 is a document where the Secretary of the National

Salaries and Cadres Commission confirmed that the Commission would submit its

recommendations if called for on the proposal to appointment Career Guidance Officers as Field

Supervising Officers. P24 is a record of discussion where it had been proposed to submit a new

Cabinet Memorandum and to seek recommendations of the National Salaries and Cadres

Commission on the proposal to create twenty-five supra grade positions. However, I am unable

to accept this assertion. None of theses documents reflect that the Respondents did hold out a

promise to the Petitioners. If at all they contain only recommendations and / or proposals.

SCFR No. 322/2011

18

When the facts of this case are considered in the context of the jurisprudence setting out the

parameters of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, as have been setout hereinbefore, it is clear

that the conduct of any of the Respondents or any other public authority could not have created a

legitimate expectation in the Petitioners that they would be placed in a position, with a higher

salary scale. Petitioners were initially recruited as Graduate Trainees in 1999 and were paid an

allowance of Rupees 4000/- per month. The Petitioners do not raise any concerns regarding the

salary scale in which they were placed, when they were appointed Career Guidance Officers in

the year 2000 (RS 72,600 – 1,560 x14 – 2,460x3 – 1,06,740/-) (P11). In fact the salary scale on

which they were placed correspond to the salary scales referred to in the general circular

governing “the attachment to permanent positions” (P9) as well as the scheme of recruitment

approved in the year 2002 (P10). They had not been placed at the salary scale of a staff grade

officer of which the initial salary step remained at Rs 74, 160/-. The salary conversion that took

place with the introduction of the circular in 2006 is in line with the provisions of that circular

and they were placed at the salary scale of MN4. Therefore, the conduct of any of the

respondents could not have created a legitimate expectation on the petitioners that they would be

placed on a higher salary scale than MN4.

The other submission of the Petitioners is that, the Petitioners’ right to equality has to be

considered in the proper context of all surrounding facts and circumstances including the current

salary scales and steps in which the fellow recruits had been placed in the other Ministries and or

Departments. Fellow recruits who joined as Graduate Trainees in the year 1999 along with them

are now placed on salary scales MN5 and or MN6. It is contended that those who hold the

positions such as Statistical Officers of the Department of Census and Statistics, Labour Officers,

Counselling Officers attached to the Ministry of Child Development and Women’s Affairs,

Family Counsellors of the Ministry of Justice and Child Rights Development Promotion Officers

attached to the Department of Probation and Child Care are placed at salary scales higher than

the salary scale that the Petitioners are placed in, namely MN4. However, document X1

submitted by the Petitioners along with the motion dated 5th February 2020 reflects that the

graduates who were recruited under the same programe launched in 1999 had been appointed to

the Ministry of Science and Technology as Science and Technology Officers in the year 2000,

SCFR No. 322/2011

19

and were placed at a similar salary scale on which the petitioners were placed in at the time of

appointment as Career Guidance Officers (Rs 72,600 – 14x1,560 – 5x2,460- 106,740/-).

It is pertinent to note that the basic qualifications required at the time of entry to a particular

position could vary according to the different nature of tasks that needs to be performed and the

skills required. Some of those positions may require the officer to possess a post-graduate

qualification at the time of entry. It is artificial and un realistic to claim that all ten thousand

persons who were initially recruited under the same scheme as trainees should be placed on the

same or identical salary scale when they have been appointed into permanent positions in

different Departments and Ministries. The salary scale of a particular post will have to be

dependent on many factors. Therefore the fact that a group of persons who were recruited under

a particular scheme as trainees had later been placed on permanent posts with passage of time in

different ministries, departments and institutions attracting different salary scales per se cannot

result in a claim of unequal treatment.

Decisions on the creation of new posts, required qualifications at the entry point to hold such

posts, mode of recruitment and the salary scales relating to such posts have to be made by

authorities based on an array of considerations. In fact according to the document marked X

tendered by the Petitioners along with the motion dated 5th February 2020, the Director-General

of Combined Services on 11th September 2019 had called for observations from all Secretaries

on the possibility of creating a supervisory position relating to Development Officers with the

salary scale MN7. Needs of each ministry or the department will be unique and a proper

appraisal in regard to all relevant aspects in the context of the overall policy on the structure in

the public service should be made in reaching a final decision on such matters. Wishes and views

of different groups including the current employees in the relevant institution who are potential

beneficiaries, is only one factor that may be considered in the process of making such decisions.

Document marked X2 submitted by the Petitioners along with the motion dated 5th February

2020, reflect that it is only in the year 2018, a scheme of recruitment had been approved to create

a post of District Vidatha Officers of the Management Assistant Supra Class with the salary scale

MN7. Approval of a scheme of recruitment in relation to a particular post would require a

process of consultations, negotiations and discussions.

Her Ladyship Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake J in Tuan Ishan Raban and Others v Members of

the Police Commission ([2007] 2 SLR 351 at 359-360) observed, that

“Article 12(1) of the Constitution ensures the protection from arbitrary and

discriminatory action by the executive and / or the administration. The objective of

Article 12(1) of the Constitution therefore is to give persons equal treatment. However

such guarantee does not forbid reasonable classification, which is founded on intelligible

differentia. The concept of equality only forbids action which is unreasonable, arbitrary

and capricious, and not the classification that is reasonable. This is based on the theory

that a classification which is good and valid cannot be regarded as arbitrary”.

The Supreme Court in Ananda Dharmadasa and Others v Ariyaratne Hewage and Others

([2008] 2 SLR 19 at 33) observed that “that every differentiation would not constitute

discrimination and accordingly classification could be founded on intelligible differentia”.

In Akarawita et al (supra) it was observed that,

“Article 12(1) of the Constitution therefore brings in a guarantee that there shall be no

discrimination between one person and another, who are equals. This does not however

mean that there cannot be any classifications between groups. Classifications are allowed

if they are not arbitrary and as stated in Ram Krishna Dalmia v Justice Tendolka (AIR

1985 S.C. 538), classifications have been founded upon intelligible differentia. The

objective of this is to treat equals equally and not unequally”.

Facts and circumstances relating to the case under consideration as discussed hereinbefore

clearly demonstrate that the respondents at no stage had acted unreasonably, arbitrarily or

capriciously. Members of a group of nearly ten thousand possessing similar qualifications,

recruited together but placed in different positions in different departments cannot be assured

with similar opportunities during the entire career including in relation to the opportunities or

avenues for promotions. Promotions will be dependent on many criteria and they will be unique.

The structure of each individual Department or Institution will depend on the needs of each such

individual department or institution and will have to be in line with the policy in relation to the

SCFR No. 322/2011

21

public sector. Therefore, maintaining different schemes of promotions in different departments

and institutions does not create an inequality between the employees in one such department or

institution as against the employees in another institution or department even though they

possess similar qualifications and were recruited as a single group and later posted to such

different institutions and / or Departments.

In view of the above findings, I hold that the Petitioners have failed to establish a violation of

their fundamental rights – the Right to equality guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

It is also pertinent to note that the Petitioners had invoked the jurisdiction of this Court on 29th

July 2011- more than ten months since the impugned decision. Respondents contend that the

Petitioners have failed to satisfy Article 126(2) of the Constitution – the requirement to invoke

the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court within one month of the alleged violation of the

Fundamental Right. In reply, the Petitioners claim that they are entitled to the benefit of section

13(1) of the Human rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No 21 of 1996. However, Respondents

further contend that the Petitioners through the documents produced marked P33 and P34 had

failed to demonstrate that there was an inquiry pending before the Human Rights Commission at

the time the Petitioners invoked the jurisdiction of this Court.

His Lordship S.N. Silva CJ in H.K. Subasinghe v The Inspector General of police et al. SC

(Spl) No 16 of 1999, SC minutes of 11.09.2000, observed that

“The petitioner seeks to bring a complaint within the time limit on the basis that he made

a complaint to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka within the stipulated time. In

this regard the petitioner relies on section 31 of the Human Rights Commission of Sri

Lanka Act, No. 21 of 1996 which provides that where a complaint has been made within

a period of one month to the Human Rights Commission, the period within which the

inquiry into such complaint was pending before the Commission will not be taken into

SCFR No. 322/2011

22

account in computing the period within which an application should be filed in this

Court.

The petitioner has failed to adduce any evidence that there has been an inquiry pending

before Human Rights Commission. In the circumstances, we have to uphold the

preliminary objection raised by learned State Counsel”.

In Divalage Upalika Ranaweeera et al v Sub Inspector Vinisias et al,1 SC FR 654/2003, SC

minutes of 13.05.2008, His Lordship Amaratunga J observed that

“a party seeking to utilize section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act to contend

that ‘the period within which the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the

Commission, shall not be taken into account in computing the period of one month within

which an application may be made to the Supreme Court’ is obliged to place material

before this court to show that an inquiry into his complaint is pending before the Human

Rights Commission”.2

I observe that P33 is a copy of an undated and unsigned application of one K.K.Palitha Padmasiri

submitted to the Human Rights Commission. P34 is a letter issued by the Human Rights

Commission on 16th November 2010. It is addressed to Mr. K.K.Palitha Padmasiri. It refers to an

application submitted on 06th October 2010. The Human Rights Commission had directed that

further details be submitted by 15 December 2010. However, Petitioners claim that P34 is a copy

of a letter the 13th Petitioner received from the Human Rights Commission informing that

observations have been called from the Respondents. This assertion is factually incorrect. As

described above, P34 is a letter calling further details from the Petitioner in relation to the

response of the Respondents dated 26th October 2010. There is no material indicating that the

1 It is pertinent to note that the judgment referred to in this paragraph is reported in [2008] 1 SLR at page 260 under the name Ranaweera and Others v Sub-Inspector Wilson Siriwardane and Others. An examination of the Petition and the Affidavit of the Petitioners in this case reveal that the 01st Respondent named therein is “Sub Inspector Vinisias” and not “Wilson Siriwardane”. “Wilson Siriwardane” is the person who is named as “care of” in the postal address of the three Petitioners. 2 [2008] 1 SLR 260 at 273

13th Petitioner did in fact submit further details called by the Human Rights Commission. There

is no material placed before this court to demonstrate that there was an inquiry pending before

the Human Rights Commission at the time the Petitioners invoked the jurisdiction of this Court,

more than ten months after the impugned decision P32.

Under these circumstances, Petitioners have failed to establish that they have complied with

Article 126(1) of the Constitution in invoking jurisdiction of this Court. However, I observe that

this Court on 14.05.2013 had granted leave to proceed in this matter. There is no material

indicating that the Court considered the ‘time bar’ when granting leave to proceed. At the

argument stage Court heard submissions of both parties on merits even though the learned

Deputy Solicitor-General raised an objection on the basis of time bar. Therefore, I proceeded to

consider all such submissions and to make the determination on merits, following the practice

adopted in Ananda Dharmadasa et al v Ariyaratne Hewage et al, [2008] 2 SLR 19, even

though this application could have been dismissed in limine on the basis of time bar.

In view of my findings on the merits of this matter as recorded hereinbefore, the Petitioners have

not been successful in establishing that their Fundamental Right guaranteed in terms of Article

12(1) of the Constitution had been infringed by the Respondents. This application is accordingly

dismissed. No costs ordered.
