Sanjay Rajaratnam PC, Acting SG with Rajitha Perera SSC for the 1st to 3rd Respondents. Indra Ladduwahetti with Anuradhi Wickramasinghe for the 4th Respondent-Respondent. Argued & Decided on: 05.02.2020 Sisira J.de Abrew, J

Heard both counsel in support of their respective cases. In this case the 4th Respondent

was employed in the Petitioner-Appellant's Company. The Commissioner of Labour by its

letter dated 08.11.2005 directed the Petitioner-Appellant Company to pay gratuity to the 4th

Respondent on the basis that he was employed in the Petitioner-Appellant's Company from 01st

of June 1988 to 25th of July 2004 and he was drawing a salary of US$ 5600 per month.

Being aggrieved by the said decision of the Commissioner of Labour, the Petitioner-

Appellant's Company filed a writ application in the Court of Appeal challenging the said

decision of the Commissioner of Labour. The Court of Appeal by its judgment dated

28.08.2009 refused the writ application of the Petitioner-Appellant's Company. Being

aggrieved by the said Judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Petitioner-Appellant's Company

filed this appeal in this Court.

This Court by its order dated 18.11.2010, granted leave to appeal on the following

questions of law. The said questions of law are set out below in verbatim.

1) Whether the Court of Appeal has erred in its complete failure to consider the

patent illegality of its order in stating that the last drawn salary of the 4th

Respondent to have been US$ 5600 which is arbitrary and utterly unsupported

and contradicted by the material placed before the 3rd Respondent ?

2) Whether the Court of Appeal has erred in not considering the impact on the

impugned order of complete failure of the 1st and/or 2nd Respondents to give

reasons for the said order, despite a written request for the same by the

Appellant Company ?

The main submissions of learned President's counsel for the Petitioner-Appellant's

Company is that the 4th Respondent was not drawing a salary of US$ 5600 per month. I now

advert to the said argument. Although the learned President's counsel contented so, the

document marked 'B', (page 322 of the brief ) indicates that the 4th Respondent was receiving

a basic salary of 3825 US$ and monthly pensionable allowance of 1775 US$ . Thus he was

drawing a salary of 5600 US$ per month. When I consider the said document, I am unable to

agree with the contention of learned President's Counsel. I therefore reject the said contention.

4

I also note that in the document marked 'D' ( page 324 of the brief) , the 4th Respondent

has worked in the Petitioner-Appellant's Company from 01st of June 1988 to 25th July 2004.

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner-Appellant's Company next contended that the

Commissioner of Labour has failed to give reasons . Although the learned President's counsel

contended so, I note in the document marked '2R1 ' and the document marked 'X17'( page 332

of the brief), the Commissioner of Labour has given sufficient reasons for his decision.

Therefore I am unable to agree with the said contention of the learned President's Counsel.

As I pointed out earlier the 4th Respondent has worked in the Petitioner-Appellant's

Company from 01st of June 1988 to 25th of July 2004 and he was drawing a monthly salary of

5600 US$ per month . Vide document marked 'B' ( page 322 of the brief). When I consider all

the above matters, I hold that the decision taken by the Commissioner of Labour is correct.

When I consider all the above matters, I hold that the Court of Appeal was correct when the

Court of Appeal dismissed the writ application filed by the Petitioner-Appellant's Company.

For the aforementioned reasons, I answer the above two questions of law in the negative.

For the aforementioned reasons, I affirm the Judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 28.08.2009

and dismiss this appeal with costs.
