S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Defendant- Appellant- Petitioner- Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

‘Defendant- Appellant’) preferred this appeal against the Substituted Plaintiff-

Respondent- Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Substituted Plaintiff-

Respondent’) to set aside the Judgment dated 26.03.2015 of the High Court of the

Western Province holden in Colombo and to set aside the judgment dated

10.02.2006 of the Learned Additional District Judge of Colombo.

The Plaintiff (now deceased), namely Faith Soysa (hereinafter referred to as the

‘Plaintiff’) instituted this action and stated in her plaint that, Felix Pereira was the

owner of the property (under and by virtue of Deed no.249 dated 17.12.1945 and

under and by virtue of Deed no.303 dated 23.03.1946) described in the 1st schedule

to the Plaint. He died leaving a Last Will No.387 and the said Will duly proved in the

District Court of Colombo in case bearing No.18617/T. Thereafter the Plaintiff and

her brother namely Joy Francis Pereira became owners of the property described in

the 1st schedule to the Plaint by Deeds No.1338 dated 12.10.1960 and No.1340 dated

05.12.1960 both attested by A.R.N. De Fonseka Notary Public and by being rest and

residual of the said Last Will No.387. In lieu of their undivided rights, the Plaintiff and

the said Joy Francis Pereira caused the sub division of the property described in the

1st schedule to the Plaint by Plan No. 2298 dated 28.09.1971 made by D.C. Peiris,

Licensed Surveyor into two lots. Thereafter, the Plaintiff became the owner of the

property bearing Assessment No. 2A and 4 described in the 2nd schedule to the

Plaint containing in extent of 27.2 Perches under and by virtue of Deed No.1726

dated 04.10.1971 attested by B.H. Amaradasan Notary Public.

The Defendant- Appellant (who is the son of the said Joy Pereira, the brother

of the Plaintiff) claimed an undivided ½ share of the said property described in the

2nd schedule to the Plaint by Deed of Transfer No. 104 dated 20.07.1992 attested by

SC Appeal 13/2018 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 13

Ahamed Irfan Zaheed Notary Public executed by the Plaintiff and the same was

registered in the Land Registry.

The Plaintiff claimed that, she did not intend to transfer the said undivided ½

share of the said property to the Defendant - Appellant and the said Deed is not an

act and deed of the Plaintiff.

The Defendant- Appellant claimed an undivided ½ share of the said property

described in the 2nd schedule to the Plaint by Deed of Gift No. 105 dated 20.07.1992

attested by Ahamed Irfan Zaheed Notary Public executed by the Plaintiff and the

same was registered in the Land Registry.

The Plaintiff claimed that, she did not intend to gift the said undivided ½

share of the said property to the Defendant- Appellant and the said Deed is not an

act and deed of the Plaintiff.

The plaintiff stated that, on 7th of July 1992 she had suffered a severe stroke

and was entered to Nawaloka Hospital by the Defendant- Appellant under Dr.

Puvimanasinghe. Plaintiff was 80 years old as per the diagnostic sheets marked as

‘P7’/’V17’. After she was admitted, she was referred to Consultant Neurologist Dr. J.B.

Pieris, Consultant Physician by Dr. Puvimanasinghe (V17w). Plaintiff stated that, on

20.07.1992 her nephew Brian Michael Francis Muller Pereira (the Defendant-

Appellant ) came with four others and took her thumb impression, which she later

came to know has been a deed of gift and deed of transfer of her property at

Torrington Place, where she reside. Plaintiff prayed that it was not her intention to

sell, gift or transfer her property to her nephew Brian Michael Francis Muller Pereira.

The Plaintiff made a complaint to the CID against the Defendant- Appellant for fraud.

SC Appeal 13/2018 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 13

Then Plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Colombo by a plaint

dated 30th July 1993 against the Defendant- Appellant inter alia praying for;

(a) For a declaration that,

(i) Deed No. 104 (marked ‘V6’) dated 20.07.1992 attested by Ahamed

Irfan Zaheed Notary Public is null and void and has no effect and

validity in law.

(ii) Deed No. 105(marked ‘V7’) dated 20.07.1992 attested by Ahamed

Irfan Zaheed Notary Public is null and void and has no effect and

validity in law.

(b) A declaration that the Plaintiff is the owner of the property described in the

2nd Schedule to the Plaint.

The Plaintiff as an alternative cause of action to the 1st cause of action had

also prayed for;

(a) A declaration that Deed No. 104 dated 20.07.1992 attested by Ahamed

Irfan Zaheed Notary Public is null and void and has no effect and validity in

law and the said deed is liable to be set aside on the ground of leasio

enormis;

(b) A declaration that the Plaintiff is the owner of undivided ½ of the property

described in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint.

At the trial the following witnesses called by the Substituted Plaintiff-

Respondent gave evidence,

(i) Dr. Jayantha Bennet Peiris, Neurologist;

(ii) Dr. D.H. Victor Perera, Psychiatrist;

(iii) S.W. Prema De Silva, Administrative Officer of Nawaloka Hospital;

(iv) K. Kankanamlage Nandawathi, an Attendant;

(v) Dayananda Rupasoma Perera, the Substituted Plaintiff- Respondent.

SC Appeal 13/2018 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 13

At the conclusion of the said evidence, the Substituted Plaintiff- Respondent

closed his case reading in evidence and documents were marked as “P1” to “P 10”

and the Defendant- Appellant objected to the admitting of documents marked “P1”

to “P4” as the said documents had not duly proved by the Substituted Plaintiff-

Respondent.

At the trial, the Defendant- Appellant called following witnesses to give

evidence.

(i) The Defendant- Appellant ;

(ii) Dr. Carl Emanual Puvimanasingham;

(iii) S.J. De Alwis, the valuer;

(iv) Jayaratne Mudannayake, the Manager- City Branch, Bank of Ceylon.

At the conclusion of the said evidence, the Defendant- Appellant closed his

case reading in evidence document marked “V1” to “V 27”.

At the commencement of the trial the parties admitted the jurisdiction of the

Court and the averments in paragraph 2 to 10 and 19 and 20 of the plaint. In

paragraphs 2 to 10 of the plaint the plaintiff pleaded her title to the allotment of land

in respect of which the impugned deeds have been executed. The main issue for the

learned District Judge to decide was whether the Plaintiff was in a proper mental

condition to understand the nature and consequences of Deeds 104 and 105.

The learned Additional District Judge answered the issues raised in favour of

the Substituted Plaintiff- Respondent and delivered his judgment on 10.02.2006 as

prayed in the Plaint. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, Defendant- Appellant

preferred a final appeal to the Provincial High Court of the Western Province (High

Court). On 26.03.2015 learned Judges of the High Court dismissed the appeal

preferred by the Defendant- Appellant with costs and held in favour of the

SC Appeal 13/2018 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 13

Substituted Plaintiff- Respondent in relying on contents of Medical Report dated

02.03.1993 produced in evidence marked “P6” by Dr. J.B. Peiris, Neurologist.

Then, Defendant- Appellant appealed to this Court. When this matter was

supported on 9th February 2018, leave to appeal was granted on the following

questions of law as set out in paragraph 28 of the Petition.

(2) Has the Plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of proof that the

plaintiff did not have an intention to dispose of the property to the Petitioner

on the basis that the Deed No. (s) 104 and 105 were not her act and deed?

(3) Has the earned High Court Judges erred in law answering Issues 1

to 4 in favour of the Plaintiff did not have mental capacity to execute the

Deeds on 17th July 1992 when the Plaintiff’s mental capacity is not in any of

the issues?

(4) Have the Learned Judges of the High Court erred in law in failing

to consider that the plaintiff has not established her case against the

petitioner by cogent evidence and on the balance of probabilities?

(5) Have the learned Judges of the High Court erred in law in failing

to consider that the plaintiff (deceased) had received the consideration of

Rs.6 Million for the said Deed No.104 and as the Plaintiff (deceased)

accepted the said consideration and utilize the said consideration, the

plaintiff is estopped from denying the validity of execution of the said Deed

No. 104 and the Deed of Gift No.105?

(6) Have the learned Judges of the High Court erred in failing to

consider that the plaint of the plaintiff (deceased) itself had contradictory

versions and the plaintiff (deceased) had not even pleaded of any absence of

mental capacity by the said plaint?

(7) Has the plaintiff failed to establish the issues No(s) 1 to 4 by

strong and cogent evidence, in the circumstances of this case?

SC Appeal 13/2018 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 13

Issues of law allowed by this Court mainly contemplate on what is mentioned

below;

1. Whether the Plaintiff failed to prove her case (Issues of Law No 2,4, and 7)

2. Whether the learned High Court Judges erred in taking ‘lack of mental

capacity of the plaintiff’ as a matter raised through issues when it is not so

(issue of law no. 3) or failed to consider that such ground was not even

averred in the plaint ( issue of law No.6) These issues of law appears to have

been raised to point out that case was proved on a different stance than that

was taken in the plaint which is contrary to Civil Procedure Code and the case

must be based on the issues raised at the trial.

3. Whether the Plaintiff is estopped from denying the validity of the deed after

accepting and utilizing the consideration.

I carefully perused the evidence of Dr. J.B. Peiris, Consultant Neurologist at

pages 127-174 and Dr. H.V. Perera, the Psychiatrist at pages 157-177. Dr. J.B. Peiris

submitted his evidence and stated he had treated the plaintiff for Paralysis from

07.07.1992 -24.07.1992 and said alleged deeds were executed on 17th July 1992

during the period of plaintiff’s hospital stay. As per submitted evidence at page 157

of the brief which is as follows.

ප% - මේ ම ෝගී තැනැත්තියට ඔප්පුවක් අත්සන් කිරීමට හැකි මානසික

තත්ත්වයක් තිබුමන් නැහැ?

උ- ඔව්.

ප%-සාමානHමයන් ම ෝගියාට වැටහීේ වලට මැදිව වමේ අසන මේ කියන්න

අපහසුයි ?

උ- ඔව්.

Further, a Report by Dr. J.B. Peiris dated 02.03.1993 was marked as “P6”

revealed that the Plaintiff had suffered a stroke involving the partial lope of the

SC Appeal 13/2018 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 13

dominant left cerebral hemisphere (this has been confirmed by the CT scan marked

as “P4”). Dr. J.B. Peiris in “P6” specifically stated as follows.

“Documented specific abnormilities detected during her hospital stay

included confusion, defective comprehension of the spoken word,

disorientation in time and space (nominal dysphasia) inability to find the

correct name for objects, dyslexia (inability to read) all related to the

pathological involvement seen in the EEG and CT head scan.

I did not consider her to be in a fit condition to comprehend questions, make

decisions or express same verbally or in writing during her hospital stay. Her

ability to do so was also assessed by Dr. R. Kulanayagam on 20 July 1992 at

my request.”

Dr. J.B. Peiris carried out another test on 23.07.1992 soon after the execution

of alleged deeds marked as “P7wd” and as per the said report the Plaintiff was unable

to say after several attempts, what year it was, she couldn’t say what month or date it

was, when she was asked what day it was, she was aware that it was Wednesday and

that tomorrow is Thursday. She had been able to recognize a pen, a watch and to

show the left little finger. She had not been able to read headlines in a newspaper

even letter by letter, she had not been able to say how much 5¤5 is.

I perused the report marked “P8” produced by Dr. H.V. Perera, Psychiatrist

dated 28.09.1992 after examining the patient and it was stated that the plaintiff’s

testamentary capacity is impaired. He stated in paragraph 2 of the “P8” as follows.

“Her memory is impaired to past and present events. She does not know her

full name or age. She does not know the extent of her bounty nor the claims

or strengths of their claims. She is disoriented in time and place.”

The evidence of Dr. J.B. Peiris and his report “P6” and his observations in the

bed head ticket on the 19.07.1992 and the 23.07.1992 conclusively proves that the

SC Appeal 13/2018 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 13

Plaintiff had no compos mentis. The report of the Dr. H.V. Perera is also conclusive

that even on the 28.09.1992 the Plaintiff had no testamentary capacity.

The evidence recorded at the trial does not carry material to indicate it is a

perverse decision. There is no material to show that the plaintiff had physical or

mental capacity to instruct the Notary or suggest amendments to what the notary

said at the time of the execution and the evidence led indicates that the converse

was more probable. Even the defendant’s witness says that she nodded her head to

the Notary. Though the said witness interprets it as consent, it may be anything.

Thus, evidence was sufficient to prove the Substituted Plaintiff- Respondent’s case.

It is true that there was no specific issue raised or averment in the plaint

highlighting the mental capacity of the deceased plaintiff at the relevant time. What

was stressed is whether the deceased plaintiff intended the execution of the deeds.

To intend one should have the mental capacity. On the other hand, to express

intention one must have the physical ability. As mentioned above there were

sufficient material for the learned Additional District Judge to come to his finding as

evidence indicate the physical inability as well as mental incapacity more probable.

As per the above, I find that Deed No.104 and 105 are not valid Deeds and are

void in the eyes of the law for the reason that the execution of the said Deeds were

not the acts and deeds of the Plaintiff and that she had no reason to gift or transfer

her property to the Defendant- Appellant. For a valid contract there must be

concensus ad idem. If one or both of them had no such intention or could not due to

some inability to comprehend the transaction or was not capable of entering into

such a transaction then there is no contract.

With regard to the proof of the case the Defendant-Appellant argues that the

deceased plaintiff was not called to give evidence when she was alive at the

beginning of the plaintiff’s case. It seems the attempt is to question the validity of

the findings of lower courts on the ground that the star witness was not called to

state that she did not intend to execute the relevant deed. It appears that Defendant

SC Appeal 13/2018 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 13

- Appellant questions calling evidence for corroboration without calling the main

witness. Further it raises the question whether the court shall consider the failure to

call the star witness when she was available against the plaintiff’s case.

However there seems to be no objection at the trial for not calling the

deceased Plaintiff first. She was listed as a witness but died before calling her and the

substituted Plaintiff who was not a witness to the incident of executing the deeds

was called. The intention to call the plaintiff is visible since her name was there in the

said list. Thus, she would have not been called due to her death and as such, not

calling her as a witness shall not be considered against the plaintiff case. On the

other hand, the other witnesses of the plaintiff, specially Dr. J.B. Peiris and the

attendant are not mere witnesses call to corroborate. They speak of the factual

situation relating to physical and mental condition of the plaintiff at the relevant

time. After hearing the both sides, the learned Additional District Judge has come to

the conclusion that the executions of impugned deeds were not intended by the

plaintiff.

Defendant- Appellant claimed that, sum of Rs. 6,000,000/- was paid for the

purported Deed of Transfer. I find that, deposit of a cheque does not validate a

transaction since the Plaintiff did not have compos mentis to execute the said deeds

and it cannot be an expression of her intention. It is my opinion that, such

transactions are void and do not become valid because some person had deposited

money in Plaintiff’s account without her knowledge.

There is no evidence to show that the consideration was deposited in the bank

by the deceased plaintiff or with her connivance or knowledge. It appears to be a

Joint account. No material to show that the said money was withdrawn and utilized

by the plaintiff or on her instruction while knowing it was the consideration for the

relevant transfer deed.

In this case the findings are purely on facts. I am not inclined to interfere with

the findings of facts arrived at by the trial courts unless they are perverse.

SC Appeal 13/2018 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 13

For the above mentioned reasons, I answer the questions of law raised in the

negative. I agree with the findings of the learned Judge of the District Court and

learned Judges of the High Court and hence I find no reason to interfere with the

said judgments. I dismiss the appeal with cost of Rs.100, 000/-.

Appeal dismissed.
