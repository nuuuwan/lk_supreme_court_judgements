SC Appeal 91/2013

5

Sisira. J. de Abrew, J Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Respondents) filed an action against the 1st Defendant-Appellant-

Petitioner-Appellant and the 2nd Defendant-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 1st and 2nd Defendants) seeking a declaration to eject

the 1st and 2nd Defendants from the property in dispute; for peaceful possession of

the property in dispute and for damages as prayed for in the plaint. The Plaintiff-

Respondents filed this action on the basis that they are the owners of the property

in dispute. The 1st and 2nd Defendants moved for a dismissal of the action. After

trial, the learned District Judge by his judgment dated 8.5.1998, held the case in

favour of the Plaintiff-Respondents. Being aggrieved by the judgment of the

learned District Judge, the 1st and 2nd Defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal

and the Court of Appeal by its judgment dated 22.10.2012 dismissed the appeal.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Court of Appeal, the 1st Defendant has

appealed to this court. This court by its order dated 14.6.2013 granted leave to

appeal on questions of law set out in paragraphs 16 (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the

Petition of Appeal dated 21.12.2012 which are set out below in verbatim.

1. Did His Lordship of the Court of Appeal fail to consider that the issue No.6

was raised by the Defendants as a preliminary issue of law on the ground of

prescription was answered in the negative on the ground that

Plaintiff/Respondents were not in possession of the property and not on the

ground that it was a declaratory action?

2. Did His Lordship of the Court of Appeal err in law when he came to an

erroneous conclusion that the consideration of the Deed produced marked as

P1 is only Rs.75,000/- when the learned District Judge has clearly stated that

SC Appeal 91/2013

6

the actual consideration is Rs.785,000/- and said finding was never

challenged by the Plaintiff/Respondents?

3. Did His Lordship of the Court of Appeal err in law when His Lordship

stated in his judgment that the only remedy available to the 1st

Defendant/Petitioner and 2A Defendant/Respondent was to initiate a

separate action to recover the balance consideration against the

Plaintiff/Respondents which is legally impossible when he has held the

consideration is only Rs.75,000/-?

4. Did His Lordship of the Court of Appeal also fail to consider that the

Plaintiff/Respondents action was prescribed in law in terms of Section 6 of

the Prescription Ordinance as the said action has been filed 7 years and two

months after the cause of action arose on the ground that it was not raised as

a preliminary issue at the commencement of trial?

5. Did His Lordship of the Court of Appeal also fail to consider that the 1st

Plaintiff/Respondent waved his right which he had under the document

produced marked P3 by which the Defendants have agreed to vacate the

premises whereas by document produced marked P6 which was dated

13.6.1987 the 1st Plaintiff/Respondent has agreed that the Defendants could

possess the property until the balance consideration is paid by their Attorney

Mrs.Charlotte Seneviratne and therefore the Plaintiff/Respondents did not

have a cause of action to institute this action?

The Plaintiff-Respondents filed this action on the basis that they are the owners of

the property in dispute. According to the evidence led by the Plaintiff-

Respondents, they purchased the property in dispute from the 1st Defendant by

SC Appeal 91/2013

7

Deed No.3128 attested by C.Seneviratne Notary Public marked P1. The

consideration stated in the said deed was Rs.75,000/-. The 1st and 2nd Defendants,

by way of an admission, admitted that they signed the deed marked P1. The

position taken up by the 2nd Defendant in his evidence was that although his wife

signed the deed marked P1, the agreed amount for the sale of the property in

dispute was Rs.1,500,000/- but they (1st and the 2nd Defendants) got only

Rs.550,000/-. However, the position taken up by the 1st and the 2nd Defendants in

their answer was that Plaintiff-Respondents had agreed to buy the property in

dispute for a sum of Rs.850,000/- and that the Plaintiff-Respondents paid

Rs.550,000/-. The 2nd Defendant has stated, in his evidence, that he and his wife

(the 2nd Defendant and 1st Defendant are husband and wife) would leave the

property in dispute if the entire amount is paid. However, the 2nd Defendant has

stated in his evidence that he had received Rs.550,000/- from the Plaintiff-

Respondents when the property in dispute was sold to the Plaintiff-Respondents.

The 1st and 2nd Defendants have admitted that they signed the Deed No.3128

attested by C. Seneviratne Notary Public. The main point urged by learned counsel

for the 1st and 2nd Defendants was that the Deed No.3128 attested by C.

Seneviratne Notary Public marked P1 is invalid since the consideration stated in

the said deed is fraudulent. However, learned counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondents

contended that the consideration stated in the said deed marked P1 was only

Rs.75,000/- and the said deed is a valid deed since the consideration mentioned in

the said deed has been paid and that if the agreed amount has not been paid there

should be a separate action for recovery of the said amount. I now advert to these

contentions.

SC Appeal 91/2013

8

There is no evidence to suggest that the consideration stated in the Deed No.3128

attested by C. Seneviratne Notary Public marked P1 was fraudulent. Document

marked P2 which is a valuation report signed by F. Guruge Licensed Surveyor and

Valuer states that the value of the property in dispute is Rs.65,000/-. Considering

above matters, I reject the above contention of learned counsel for the Defendant-

Appellants that the consideration in the said deed is fraudulent.

Assuming without conceding that the consideration stated in the Deed marked P1

was Rs.850,000/- and not paid to the 1st Defendant by the Plaintiff-Respondents,

does it mean that the said Deed marked P1 would become invalid. I may in another

way present this question in the following manner.

Even if the consideration mentioned in a deed of transfer is not paid to the seller,

does the deed of transfer become invalid?

In order to answer the above question, I would like to consider certain judicial

decisions.

In Jayawardena Vs Amarasekara 15 NLR 280 Lascalles CJ held as follows.

On the execution of a notarial conveyance the sale is complete, and the

mere fact that the whole of the consideration has not been paid cannot, in

the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, afford ground for the rescission

of the sale and the cancellation of the conveyance.

In Mohamadu Vs Hussim 16 NLR 368 Pereira J held as follows.

Where a person obtains a conveyance of property without fraud, but

afterwards fraudulently refuses to pay the consideration stipulated for, the

SC Appeal 91/2013

9

grantor is not entitled to claim a cancellation of the conveyance, but his

remedy is an action for the recovery of the consideration.

Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold that a

deed of transfer executed without fraud by a Notary Public in accordance with the

provisions of the Notaries Ordinance does not become invalid if the consideration

stated in the deed of transfer is not paid to the seller. I further hold that in such a

0situation, remedy of the seller of the property is to file a separate action for the

recovery of the consideration. Considering all the above matters, I hold that the

Plaintiff-Respondents are the owners of the property in dispute and that they

became the owners upon the execution of the Deed No.3128 attested by C.

Seneviratne Notary Public marked P1.

The next question that must be considered is whether the Plaintiff-Respondents in

this case could seek ejectment of the 1st and the 2nd Defendants from the property

in question without a specific prayer for declaration of title. I now advert to this

question. The answer to this question is found in the judicial decisions in the case

of Jayasinghe Vs Tikiri Banda [1988] 2 CALR 24 wherein Viknaraja J held as

follows:

Where title to the property has been proved, as in this case the fact that one

had failed to ask for a declaration of title to the property will not prevent

one from claiming the relief of ejectment.

In Dharmasiri Vs Wickramatunga [2002] 2 SLR 218 Weerasuriya J held as

follows.

SC Appeal 91/2013

10

Even though the plaintiff has not asked for a declaration of title it does not

prevent him from seeking the relief for ejectment.

In the case of Pathirana Vs Jayasundara 58 NLR169 at page 172 Gratiaen J held as

follows.

In a rei vindicatio action proper the owner of immovable property is

entitled, on proof of his title, to a decree in his favour for the recovery of the

property and for the ejectment of the person in wrongful occupation.

Applying the principles laid down in the above judicial decisions, I hold that in an

action for ejectment of the defendant from the property in dispute, once the

plaintiffs title to the property is proved, he (the plaintiff) is entitled to ask for

ejectment of the defendant from the property even though there is no prayer in the

plaint for a declaration of title.

In the present case the Plaintiff-Respondents, in the body of the plaint, have

pleaded their title to the property in question and issue No.1 which was accepted

by trial court was whether 1st Defendant by Deed No.3128 transferred the property

in dispute to the Plaintiff-Respondents. The learned trial Judge answered this issue

in the affirmative. When I consider the evidence led at the trial, I hold that the

decision of the learned trial Judge in answering the above issue in the affirmative is

correct and that the Plaintiff-Respondents are the owners of the property in dispute.

When I consider all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the Plaintiff-

Respondents are entitled to seek ejectment of the Defendant-Appellants even

though there is no separate prayer in the plaint for a declaration of title.

SC Appeal 91/2013

11

Learned counsel for the Defendant-Appellants next contended that the action of the

Plaintiff-Respondents should fail on the basis of Section 6 of the Prescription

Ordinance which reads as follows.

No action shall be maintainable upon any deed for establishing a

partnership, or upon any promissory note or bill of exchange, or upon any

written promise, contract, bargain, or agreement, or other written security

not falling within the description of instruments set forth in section 5, unless

such action shall be brought within six years from the date of the breach of

such partnership deed or of such written promise, contract, bargain, or

agreement, or other written security, or from the date when such note or bill

shall have become due, or of the last payment of interest thereon.

I now advert to this contention. The Plaintiff-Respondents have filed this action on

the basis that they are the owners of the property in dispute on the strength of the

Deed No.3128 attested by C Seneviratne Notary Public marked P1. The action has

not been filed on the basis of a document mentioned in Section 6 of the

Prescription Ordinance. Further I note that there was no specific issue at the trial

whether the action should fail on the basis of Section 6 of the Prescription

Ordinance. The 1st and the 2nd Defendants have raised an issue at the trial to the

effect that whether the action of the Plaintiff-Respondents has been prescribed.

This issue was tried as a preliminary issue. The learned trial Judge, by his order

dated 31.5.1996, answered the above issue in the negative and decided that this

action was not a possessory action. The 1st and the 2nd Defendants have not filed an

appeal against the said judgment in the Court of Appeal.

SC Appeal 91/2013

12

In a possessory action person who claims the possession of the property must

prove that he was dispossessed from the property. The action should be filed

within one year from the alleged dispossession. In the present case, according to

the Plaintiff-Respondents, after the execution of Deed No.3128 attested by

C.Seneviratne Notary Public marked P1, they never got possession of the property

in dispute. The Plaintiff-Respondents in their plaint have sought an order for

ejectment of the 1st and 2nd Defendants and their agents from the property in

dispute. The Plaintiff-Respondents filed this case on the basis that they are the

owners of the property in dispute. When I consider all the above matters, I hold

that this is not a possessory action. The learned District Judge has considered the

above matters in his order dated 31.5.1996 and decided that this action was not a

possessory action. Considering all the aforementioned matters, I hold that the

learned District Judge has come to the correct conclusion in his order dated

31.5.1996.

Considering all the above matters, I reject the above contention of learned counsel

for the 1st and the 2nd Defendants.

His Lordship of the Court of Appeal while dismissing the appeal of the 1st and 2nd

Defendants has made an order to the effect that the Plaintiff-Respondents should

pay Rs.300,000/- to the 1st and the 2nd Defendants when the property in dispute is

handed over to the Plaintiff-Respondents. I would reproduce below the order of the

Court of Appeal. It is as follows.

However, I hold with the trial Judges ruling that the Plaintiff need to pay a

sum of rupees three hundred thousand which is the balance sum due on the

SC Appeal 91/2013

13

transaction, and Defendants would be entitled to the said sum on handing

over the vacant possession.

I would like to note that the 1st and the 2nd Defendants have, in their answer, not

sought such a relief. The 2nd Defendant in his evidence has admitted that he

received Rs.550,000/- from the Plaintiff-Respondents when the property in dispute

was sold to the Plaintiff-Respondents and that they (1st and 2nd Defendants) would

leave the property in dispute once they receive the entire amount. Thus, the amount

of Rs.300,000/- appears to be the balance amount that they expected. I have earlier

held that the Plaintiff-Respondents have, upon the execution of the Deed of

Transfer No.3128 attested by C. Seneviratne Notary Public marked P1, become the

owners of the property in dispute. If the Plaintiff-Respondents are the owners of

the property in dispute, the 1st and the 2nd Defendants cannot, in this action, be

permitted and are not entitled to succeed in a condition that they would leave the

property in dispute once Rs.300,000/- is paid OR that the Plaintiff-Respondents

should pay Rs.300,000/- to the 1st and the 2nd Defendants when they hand over

vacant possession of the property in dispute to the Plaintiff-Respondents. However,

the1st and the 2nd Defendants may have a separate cause of action to recover the

said amount in a separate case. It will have to be decided according to the law of

the land. Upon the execution of the Deed of Transfer No.3128 attested by C.

Seneviratne Notary Public marked P1, the sale is complete. I therefore hold that the

above order of the Court of Appeal, that is to say that the Plaintiff-Respondents

should pay Rs.300,000/- to the 1st and the 2nd Defendants when they hand over

vacant possession of the property in dispute to the Plaintiff-Respondents cannot be

permitted to stand. I therefore set aside the aforementioned order of the Court of

Appeal relating to payment of Rs.300,000/- by the Plaintiff-Respondents to the 1st

SC Appeal 91/2013

14

and the 2nd Defendants. Subject to the above variation, I affirm the judgment of the

Court of Appeal and dismiss this appeal. The Plaintiff-Respondents who are the

owners of the property in dispute are entitled to eject the 1st and the 2nd Defendants

from the property in dispute and for peaceful possession of the property in dispute.

The learned District Judge is directed to enter decree in accordance with this

judgment.

For all the aforementioned reasons, I answer the 1st, 2nd 3rd and 4th questions of law

above in the negative. The 5th question of law does not arise for consideration.

Appeal dismissed.
