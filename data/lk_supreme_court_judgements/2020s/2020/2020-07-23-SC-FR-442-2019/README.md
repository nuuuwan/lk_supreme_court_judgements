The parties in FR 443/2019 AND 444/2019 agreed to abide by this judgement. Therefore this

judgement has the binding effect in all the said cases.

The Petitioner invokes the jurisdiction of this court alleging the infringement of her

Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Articles 12 (1) and the 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution

by the Respondents.

The Petitioner states that, she has received medical education from the foreign universities and

was awarded the relevant degrees of medicine after the completion of the specific periods of

study. The Petitioner further states that, having obtained their degrees of medicine she returned

to Sri Lanka and sought approval from the Sri Lanka Medical Council (hereinafter sometime

called as SLMC) to sit for the Examination for Registration to Practise Medicine (hereinafter

sometime called as ERPM) but the approval has not been granted. As per the contention of

the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent has imposed a pre-entry qualification on the medical

graduates from foreign universities which is bad in law and this application invoking the

Fundamental Rights jurisdiction basically challenges the conduct of the 1st Respondent on the

failure to grant permission to sit for the ERPM as grossly indefensible, unreasonable, arbitrary,

capricious mala fide, unfair which involves in the violation of the principles of legitimate

expectation, natural justice and reasonableness.

The 1st Respondents contention is that the Petitioner does not possess the relevant

qualifications. The 1st Respondent further states that, the Petitioner is not qualified to sit for the

ERPM as she has not acquired the G.C.E Advanced Level qualification as adopted by the 1st

Respondent in February 2010 as per the powers vested on the SLMC in terms of the section 29

(1) (b) (ii) (cc) of the Medical Ordinance.

Section 29(2) deals with provisional registration as a medical practitioner and provisions

relating to such registration for a person who hold a degree of Bachelor of Medicine from a

foreign university which is recognized by the SLMC are as follows.

The section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance states,

(iii) not being qualified to be registered under any of the preceding sub-paragraphs-

3

(aa) is a citizen of Sri Lanka;

(bb)

(i) holds a degree of Bachelor of Medicine or an equivalent

qualification of any university or medical school of any country other

than Sri Lanka, which is recognized by the Medical Council for the

purposes of this section having regard to the standard of medical

education of such university or medical school; or

The section 29 (2) (cc) of the Medical Ordinance reads as follows,

......has passed the special examination prescribed in that behalf by the

Medical Council.

As per the aforesaid section 29(2)(iii)(bb)(i) of the Medical Ordinance, it is clear that, in

addition to the requirement of having a good character (as sets out in Section 29(2)(a) ), the

most imperative requirement which is essential to be entitled for the provisional registration as

a medical professional is the possession of a degree of a Bachelor of Medicine or an equivalent

qualification of any university or a medical school of any country other than Sri Lanka, which

is recognized by the SLMC. Further, the section gives a deep emphasis on the standards of

medical education of such university or medical school. It is clear to this court that, the section

29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance surfaces two important facts. The first among such facts insists

that, Sri Lanka has emphasized the freedom of medical education within or outside the country.

Thus, the law facilitates the medical education in local and foreign universities. The second

foremost fact signified by the section is the recognition which is given by the SLMC on the

universities imparting medical knowledge. The Medical Ordinance has expressly recognized

the freedom of Sri Lankan students to receive the foreign medical education.

The section 29(2)(iii)(cc) further stresses on the passing of a special examination prescribed in

that behalf by the SLMC.

It is evident to this court that, the Petitioner of this case has complied with the section 29

(2)(iii)(bb)(i) of the Medical Ordinance, where she has attended and obtained medical degrees

and equivalent qualifications from the foreign universities recognized by the SLMC.

Subsequent to her university education, she requested the SLMC to issue a degree approval

certificate which is a pre-condition to sit for the ERPM exam but until the institution of this

4

action the Petitioner has not received a response and not been permitted up to date by the SLMC

to sit the ERPM.

The details of the university of the Petitioner are as follows:

SC.FR/442/2019

Name of the Petitioner University Year

Shamini Jayathilaka

Vitebsk State Medical University 2013

As per the provisions of the Medical Ordinance, SLMC is recognized as a corporate body which

has a power to grant and issue provisional registration to the persons satisfying the requisite

criteria under the Ordinance. The section 29(2)(iii)(cc) of the Medical Ordinance further

empowered to prescribe special examinations which are to be followed by the relevant medical

graduates. The authority of the SLMC is extended to carry out the ERPM under the said

provisions.

The prominent attention of the Petitioner has been positioned on the pre-entry qualification

imposed by the SLMC. The pre-entry qualification specifies as a mandatory educational entry

qualification to follow courses in medicine/ dentistry which necessitates Those who enter

foreign medical schools from 01.June 2010 onwards should have obtained passes in Biology,

Chemistry and Physics/Mathematics with credits in at least two of these subjects at the G.C.E.

(Advanced Level) Sri Lanka or .........(1R5 of case no SC/FR/399/2019)

The Petitioner holds that, the imposition of a pre-entry qualification is unreasonable, not

justifiable and ultra-vires. The matter which is insisted by the Petitioner is that, even though

she has complied with the black letter law of the country, imposition of the pre-entry

qualification through an ultra vires decision has barred her illegally.

In S.F. Zamrath v. Sri Lanka Medical Council & Others (S.C.F.R.Application No: 119/2019

SC minutes of 23.07.2019), this court elaborated the purview which SLMC has been granted

by law. There, the court has accepted that administrative authorities are bound to meet the

challenging needs of the society.

As the apex court of the country, this court encourages the flexibility and

adaptability of the administrative authorities in making policies and taking

5

decisions, but still insists on the fact that, such conduct should not be used unfair

and arbitrary....

The imposition of the pre-entry requirement was further seen as an instance where the SLMC

has overridden its powers.

The 1st Respondents subsequent imposition of an alleged pre-entry

qualification to the university is now held out by the 1st Respondent as the

alleged reason for denying the Petitioner provisional registration. The 1st

Respondent has attempted to act in contrary to the existing law enacted by the

Parliament. Thus, it is clear that, the 1st Respondent has exceeded the powers

within its purview. The 1st Respondent is authorized to make rules in the

instances where necessary, but no authority has been granted power to

override a law enacted by the Parliament.

The obligation on the part of the SLMC to comply with the provisions of the Medical

Ordinance was further emphasized by his Lordship Justice Padman Surasena, in S.M Halpe

& Others v. Dr. Anil Jayasinghe ( S.C.F.R.Application No: 54/2019). His Lordship stated,

The entitlement of the Petitioner and those who are similarly

circumstanced, for provisional registration as medical practitioners,

under section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance flows from the law of the

country. They will therefore continue to have that entitlement. That

entitlement cannot be taken away by the SLMC........Thus, the SLMC is

denying the equal protection of law and their right to engage in any lawful

occupation, profession, trade business or enterprise. This no doubt would

be a continuous infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed to

them, by Article 12 (1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution. Further, the said

infringement continues to date. The said continuous infringement shows

no signs of abating. Thus, the argument by the Respondent that the

Petitioners application is out of time cannot succeed.

The speciality of his Lordships statement lies on the fact that, he recognized the provisional

registration guaranteed under the section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance as an entitlement.

This signifies the very fact that, provisional registration does amount to a right which is sprung

from the law of the country.

6

In the present application, SLMC fails to grant the approval to sit for the ERPM, thereby

impeding the right of the Petitioner for provisional registration. It is very clear to this court

that, SLMCs conduct resembles the usurpation of powers of the Parliament which stands as

the supreme legislative authority of the country. Further, it is surprising to see the arbitrariness

of the SLMC which alters the procedures and laws of the country. The very essence of the

view expressed by his Lordship Justice Padman Surasena in S.M Halpe & Others v. Dr. Anil

Jayasinghe (Supra) emphasizes that, SLMC has no power to take out a right which has been

granted by the law.

The same view was held in the FR applications 149/2019 and 145/2019 where this court held

a similar notion on the supremacy of the Parliament and the regulatory authority of the SLMC.

Thus, this courts view was that, ordinary law of the land is predominant and a law which was

passed by the Parliament cannot be overridden by a regulation which has arbitrarily imposed

by a subordinate authority.

The 1st Respondents contention is that the court had held in the case of Zamrath (supra) that

the pre-entry qualification of Advanced Level was held to be illegal only on the ground of

violating the legitimate expectation and in the present case the requirement was imposed in

2010 and therefore the said judgment has no application. I cannot agree with this argument.

In the said case the court had considered two aspects, that is, the violation of legitimate

expectation and the ultra-vires nature of the SLMC decision. It has been held in the said case

that,

The 1st Respondents subsequent imposition of an alleged pre entry

qualification to the university is now held out by the 1st Respondent as

the alleged reason for denying the Petitioner provisional registration.

The 1st Respondent has attempted to act in contrary to the existing law

enacted by the Parliament. Thus, it is clear that, the 1st Respondent has

exceeded the powers within its purview. The 1st Respondent is authorized

to make rules in the instances where necessary, but no authority has been

granted power to override a law enacted by the Parliament. Further, the

1st Respondent cannot expect that, the rules imposed by it can operate

retrospectively to thrust a burden on the Petitioner whose qualifications

for provisional registration met with the existing law at the time of

7

entering the university prior to the arbitrarily imposition of the alleged

pre entry qualification.

Further, it was held that, depriving the right to sit for ERPM does amount to a severe

violation of the future prospects of professional life of the medical graduates.

It is pertinent to note that, the Parliament being the Supreme legislative body of the country

has approved a certain level of minimum qualification to enter in to the medical education. In

General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (Special Provisions) Act No: 17 of 2018, by

its section 2 (a) specifies that

The General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University shall have the power to

absorb those students who have obtained basic qualifications from among the

students who have registered with the South Asian Institute of Technology and

Medicine (hereinafter referred to as the SAITM) .......

Further, the section 2(c) states,

to award to those students having basic qualifications and have completed the study

programme leading to the award of the MBBS Degree at the SAITM on or before the

appointed date.

The section 4 of the act, interprets the term basic qualification to mean,

minimum of S grade (simple) pass in Chemistry, Physics and Biology at the

G.C.E. (Advanced level) examination conducted by the Examinations

Department of the Ministry of Education of Sri Lanka ....... or an equivalent

foreign qualification...

The wordings of the act clearly show the intention of the Parliament. The intention of the

Parliament reflects that, the minimum qualification to be eligible for the MBBS degree is

minimum of S grade pass in Chemistry, Physics and Biology. Thus, it is evident that, the

Parliament has given the freedom to accept the minimum qualification as 3 S passes. Medical

Ordinance being the main legal enactment is silent on the requirement as to the minimum

qualification. This manifests that, the minimum qualification to study medicine is a matter to

be decided by the specific university based on the relevant criteria. It is evident that, SLMC

cannot influence the decisions of the relevant universities and to impose their own

qualifications.

8

The first Respondents argument is that he is entitled to prescribe a special examination for

foreign medical graduates under S 29 (2) (ii) (cc) of the Medical Ordinance. The Medical

Ordinance permits the SLMC to prescribe a special examination for the foreign medical

graduates. It has to be a special examination. At present the SLMC is holding an examination

called Examination to Register Practice Medicine (ERPM). Unless the foreign graduate

passes this examination he does not become entitled to Register Practise Medicine. Under

this Section the SLMC is not empowered to prescribe any pre-entry qualifications to enter into

a foreign university. It is a matter for the said university to decide what the pre-entry

qualifications should be. The SLMC can evaluate the said university and grant or refuse

recognition. Other than granting or refusing recognition to the said university or medical

school, the SLMC cannot decide the pre-entry qualifications. Nor the SLMC is empowered to

impose further restrictions to sit for the ERPM other that the requisites stipulated by the statue.

Therefore, I do not agree with the argument of the first Respondent in that regard.

This court sees a grave misunderstanding on the part of the 1st Respondent over the powers

which have been allocated by the law. The SLMC, by section 29 (2) (cc) is empowered to

hold examinations to select the suitable medical practitioners from among the medical

graduates in the country. The section allows no interference with the Advanced Level

qualifications which determine the eligibility for the medical education.

It is clear that, the very decision made by the SLMC has deeply influenced the substantive rights

and obligations of others, mainly the Petitioner. The decision of the SLMC gravely violates the

future prospects of the professional life of the Petitioner. The right to equality of the Petitioner

is prima facie in violation.

The 1st Respondent further argues that the application of the Petitioner is time barred. This

argument is based on the one month rule in the Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction. The 1st

Respondent s position is that, the invoking of the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction should be

taken place within one month from the alleged infringement and the Petitioner ought to have

challenged the decision in the instance where she first came to know the decision. While

justifying this contention in an unjust manner, the 1st Respondent states that, it was within the

knowledge of the Petitioner that the decision of the SLMC influences their right to sit for the

ERPM. It is apparent that, the decision of the SLMC is implemented in the year 2010. The

Petitioner entered to the university which has been recognized by the SLMC and thereby

derived a legitimate expectation that, they will be given an opportunity to sit for the ERPM.

9

The conduct of the Respondent SLMC based on their ultra vires decision- the decision to

impose pre entry qualification to medical studies overseas and or to sit for ERPM- had

impacted upon such legitimate expectation of the petitioner, adversely. Further, the Petitioner

resorted to this Court, at the failure to grant approval and it is clear that, she is entitled to redress

her grievance as the said failure is clearly a continuing infringement of her right to equal

protection of law.

It is clear to this court that, SLMC has arbitrarily imposed a pre-entry qualification for the

provisional registration of the foreign medical graduates as the medical practitioners. It is

apparent to this court that, the specific decision of the SLMC unjustly imposes a burden on

the Petitioner over her professionalism and the purview of powers which has already been

granted by the Medical Ordinance is overridden.

By concluding the judgement, this Court adopts the view that, the Fundamental Rights

guaranteed to the Petitioner under the articles 12 (1) and 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution have

been infringed by the act of Respondents which refused to grant permission to sit for the

ERPM while imposing a pre-entry qualification against the law of the country. Thus, the

Court reiterates on the fact that, the Respondents acted arbitrarily while making a decision

which has influenced the substantive rights of the Petitioner in a great deal and orders the 1st

Respondent to allow the Petitioner to sit for the ERPM.
