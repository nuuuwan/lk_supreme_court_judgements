Judgement

Aluwihare PC J.,

1. Although a judgement should restrict itself to the grounds urged in appeal,

owing to the special circumstances, this court feels obliged to address another

issue as well, namely the duty of a judge to ensure that an Accused is manifestly

accorded a fair trial. This court notes with grave concern that in this

fundamental duty, the learned High Court Judge has lamentably failed and

reasons for arriving at this conclusion will be specified in the course of this

judgement.

2. The Indian Supreme Court in the case of Zahira Habibullah Sheikh and Others

v. State of Gujarat [Appeal (crl.) 446-449 of 2004] held that:

Right from the inception of the judicial system it has been accepted that

discovery, vindication and establishment of truth are the main purposes

underlying existence of Courts of justice. The operating principles for a fair

trial permeate the common law in both civil and criminal contexts. Application

of these principles involve a delicate judicial balancing of competing interests

in a criminal trial, the interests of the accused and the public.

3. The court went on to hold that; As will presently appear, the principle of a fair

trial manifests itself in virtually every aspect of our practice and procedure,

including the laws of evidence. There is, however, an overriding and, perhaps,

unifying principle. The court went onto quote Justice Deanes statement to the

effect that It is desirable that the requirement of fairness be separately

identified since it transcends the context of more particularized legal rules and

principles and provides the ultimate rationale and touchstone of the rules and

practices which the common law requires to be observed in the administration

of the substantive criminal law. Further, fair trial was delineated thus by the

4

court; Fair trial obviously would mean a trial before an impartial Judge, a

fair prosecutor and atmosphere of judicial calm. Fair trial means a trial in

which bias or prejudice for or against the accused, the witnesses, or the cause

which is being tried is eliminated.

4. There is an additional matter that this court was called upon to decide in the

instant case. That is, as to whether the application for Special Leave to Appeal

is out of time. The impugned judgement of the Court of Appeal is dated 22nd

May 2017 and the formal Petition in conformity with the Supreme Court Rules

had been filed on 17th October 2017, which is almost five months after the

delivery of the judgement of the Court of Appeal. In that sense this application

is clearly out of time.

5. The learned counsel for the Accused-Appellant, however, explaining the delay

submitted, that the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (the BASL) conducted a clinic

at the Welikada prison as a part of a legal aid program to render legal assistance

to its inmates. The learned counsel submitted that at this clinic, the Accused-

Appellant had intimated to the BASL officials that, aggrieved by the Court of

Appeal judgement, he had forwarded an appeal to the Supreme Court on 1st

July 2017 through the Superintendent of Prisons. It appears that the

Superintendent of Prisons had referred it to the prison headquarters to be

forwarded to the Supreme Court. This court called for a report from the

Superintendent of Prisons, Welikada regarding this matter and a report was

duly furnished on 2nd August 2018, which is filed of record. According to the

same, the Assistant Superintendent of Prisons M. M. B. Senevirathne has

confirmed the fact that the Accused-Appellant had in fact handed over an

appeal against the judgement of the Court of Appeal to be forwarded to the

Supreme Court, which the Assistant Superintendent of Prisons says he

forwarded to the Commissioner of Prisons (Establishments) at the Prison

Headquarters. A copy of the entry made in the register maintained to record

5

requests by prisoners was also submitted to this court along with a copy of the

hand-written appeal, addressed to the Supreme Court by the Accused-

Appellant. The appeal is dated 1st July 2017, which is within the time stipulated

under the Supreme Court rules to file a Special Leave to Appeal application.

6. The entry in the said register is dated 4th July 2017. In addition, a copy of the

covering letter addressed to the Commissioner of Prisons (Establishments)

stating that the appeal submitted by the Accused-Appellant is forwarded (with

his recommendation) to be submitted to the Supreme Court, was also tendered

to this Court, along with the report of the Assistant Superintendent of Prisons,

aforesaid.

7. The point I wish to stress is that, the Accused-Appellant has expressed every

intention to appeal against the judgement of the Court of Appeal and has done

whatever possible within the limited means available to him, despite the

constraints he faced.

8. The learned Deputy Solicitor General upholding the highest traditions of the

Attorney Generals Department, submitted that she would not, in the interest

of justice, be raising the technical objection of the time bar.

9. I am also reminded of the words of Chief Justice Abrahams in the case of

Velupillai v. Chairman, Urban District Council 39 N.L.R 464, where His

Lordship referring to a procedural defect said, at page 465 I think that if we

do not allow the amendment in this case we should be doing a very grave

injustice to the plaintiff. It would appear as if the shortcomings of his legal

adviser, the peculiarities of law and procedure and the congestion in the Courts

have all combined to deprive him of his cause of action In the case before

us the Accused-Appellant did not have the benefit of a legal adviser. Chief

6

Justice Abrahams went on to emphasize, that this [the Supreme Court] is a

court of justice, it is not an Academy of Law.

10. In the circumstances aforesaid, the matter was taken up for support on 28th

January 2020 and the court granted Special Leave to Appeal on the question of

law referred to in sub-paragraph (e) of paragraph 23 of the regularized

petition dated 19th October 2017, which is reproduced below;

(e) Did the learned High Court Judge and the judges of the

Court of Appeal err in law and in fact by failing to consider the

fact that imposing a term of rigorous imprisonment for 81 years

for two types of offences included in six counts in the indictment,

which alleged [sic] to have been committed by the Petitioner

(accused) on the victim within a period of 3 months is excessive

and against the well-accepted principles of sentencing and

theories of punishment. [emphasis added]

11. As the question of law is confined only to the issue of the imposition of an

excessive sentence, both the learned counsel for the Petitioner as well as the

learned Deputy Solicitor General agreed to make submissions on behalf of

the respective parties on the aforestated question of law with a view to an

early disposal of this matter. Accordingly, this court, acting under the

proviso Rule 16(1) of the Supreme Court Rules, dispensing with the

requirement of complying with the provisions of the Rules regarding the

steps preparatory to the hearing of the appeal, heard the learned counsel on

the very day that Special Leave to Appeal was granted.

7

The Sequence of Events

12. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Accused) was

indicted before the High Court of Anuradhapura on six counts. (As the

victim was a girl below the age of 16, I shall refer to her as SK).

13. Count Nos. 1, 3 and 5 on the indictment were counts of Kidnapping (SK)

whilst count Nos. 2, 4 and 6 were counts of Rape. According to the

indictment, these offences had been committed between 01st December

2011 and 20th February 2012, within a time span of roughly 3 months.

14. According to the proceedings of 25th September 2013, the Accused had been

served with the indictment and the learned High Court judge had ordered

bail and had granted the Accused time until 21st October 2013 to furnish

bail.

15. On the 21st of October 2013 the indictment had been read over to the

Accused and he had pleaded not guilty to all the counts. As the Accused had

not been represented by a lawyer, the Court had assigned Attorney-at-Law

Ms. Priyanthi Hettiarchchi (hereinafter referred to as the assigned counsel)

and accordingly, the trial had been fixed for the 5th of November 2013.

16. At this point, I also wish to refer to the fact that the procedure adopted by

the learned High Court Judge was erroneous. This matter was mentioned on

the 21st of October 2013 only to ascertain as to whether the Accused had

furnished bail. The learned High Court Judge (predecessor of the trial judge)

however, caused the indictment to be read to the Accused and the Accused

had been asked to plead to the charges. The arraignment of an Accused is

specifically provided for in Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,

which states that, when the court is ready to commence the trial..the

8

indictment shall be read and explained to him and he shall be asked whether

he is guilty or not guilty of the offence charged. [emphasis added]

17. Thus, its clear that the indictment should be read and explained to the

Accused only when the case is fixed for trial.

18. The trial had commenced on 5th November 2013 and the Prosecution had

led the evidence of SK, the Prosecutrix. The assigned counsel represented the

Accused. In the course of the examination-in-chief SK had said that the

Accused happened to be her mothers ex-husband [it is not clear from the

evidence as to whether the Accused was legally married to SKs mother]. In

relating her story, she had commenced her evidence by narrating the last

incident referred to in the indictment. She had said that on 21st February

2012, [this date in fact is outside the period referred to in the indictment in

which the prosecution alleges the incidents of kidnapping and rape took

place] she came by bus to go to school and got off at Thambuththegama town

and when she walked towards a shop (the purpose has not been disclosed)

the Accused came on a motorcycle and forced her to get on to the bike and

had brought her to a house. After taking her to a room there, the Accused

had forcibly removed her clothes. She had said that she was wearing a skirt

and a blouse at the time. When the State Counsel questioned her about the

school uniform, she said that she brought a change of clothes as she was

supposed to practice for the school sports meet. It was on the way to the said

house, that the Accused had got her to change into the skirt and the blouse.

19. SK had said in her testimony that the Accused had had sexual intercourse

with her forcibly and that she had observed blood stains on her underwear.

She had also said that while she and the Accused were in the room, the

Accused received a telephone call which SK presumed was from her mother.

9

After the incident the Accused had dropped SK at the house of one Keshani,

a schoolmate of hers.

20. SK had been questioned by the State Counsel with regard to the other

incidents alleged to have taken place prior to the incident of the 21st of

February on which count Nos. 1 to 4 were based. SKs testimony was that

she was previously taken to a lonely spot and that the Accused tried to

remove her clothes, but she did not allow him to do so. Her answer was,

weus .,j,d fusjd lrkak yejd, uql=;a lrkak kafka keye ux.

21. In response to the question as to what the Accused did after her clothes were

removed, SKs response was that there was no complete removal of clothes

iusmQK .ef,jsfjs keye. After each of these incidents, SK had been

brought back to coincide with the time that the class she was due to attend

was scheduled to be over. In the course of the examination-in-chief the

learned State Counsel has asked a specific question as to what the Accused

did after her clothes were removed.

Q. tod weka .,j,d fudllao lf<a?

A. tfyu fudl=;a lf<a keye, bkak wdj

22. SK had thereafter been questioned about the 1st incident referred to in the

indictment, vis-a-vis the sequence of the counts [1 and 2] on the indictment.

To appreciate the evidence given by SK in relation to this incident, I have

reproduced the relevant portion of the evidence.

23. From the above testimony of SK, it is clearly established that the Accused had

had sexual intercourse with SK only on the 21st of February but on the two

previous occasions referred to in the indictments, on which counts 2 and 4

were based, SK appears to have been sexually harassed, but the evidence

emanating from the Prosecutrix herself clearly rules out sexual intercourse

on those occasions. At this point it would be pertinent to consider the medical

evidence as well.

24. Dr. D. L. Waidyaratne, consultant Judicial Medical Officer, (JMO) Teaching

Hospital, Anuradhapura had examined SK on 24th February 2013, which

was three days after the alleged incident.

He has recorded his findings as follows:

No external injuries seen.

Hymen: Fresh, partly healed 6 oclock Hymenal tear was present.

Vulva and labia swollen, red and tender.

Opinion: Features of recent sexual penetration were present.

The JMO in his testimony had affirmed what he had stated in his report (the

Medico-Legal Report) and had said that the last incident referred to by SK, is

compatible with his observations.

25. This confirms the version of SK, that she had been subjected to sexual

intercourse only once. Had she been subjected to such acts previously it was

11

very likely for the JMO to have observed old hymenal tears or may not have

observed a fresh hymenal tear.

26. With regard to the two incidents prior to the incident of the 21st of February

2013, only a solitary question had been put to the doctor by the Prosecution.

Upon being asked whether it is his position that previous instances of

penetration cannot be ruled out, Dr. Waidyaratne had answered yes. The

Prosecution has, however, failed to ask the consultant JMO, the reasons for

him to entertain such an opinion, which was mandatory on the part of the

Prosecution. To facilitate the evaluation of the evidence of an expert, the

expert must furnish the court with the rationale and the reasoning of the

expert for forming a particular opinion. The State Counsel should have

elicited his reasons, the media and the grounds from the medical expert for

him to express such an opinion. In terms of Section 45 of the Evidence

Ordinance, the experts opinion is only relevant and not conclusive. The

learned State Counsel has totally overlooked the fact that the burden is on

the Prosecution to establish the charges beyond reasonable doubt. I regret to

state that the manner in which the Prosecution had been conducted in this

case is far from satisfactory.

27. SKs mother, Samanmali too had testified and had stated that at the time

relevant to the incident, she was living with the Accused and his son at the

Accuseds house. In addition, her brother one Vijitha Kumara, also had given

evidence. None of these witnesses had added much to the Prosecution case.

28. The Prosecution also called a witness by the name of Vishaka Priyadarshini

who had testified to the effect that on the day in question (21st February) SK

came to their place with the Accused, whom the witness referred to as SKs

father. It appears that SK and the daughter of this witness were friends.

When this witness questioned SK the reason for her coming, SK has said that

12

she came because she cannot live with her mother. This witness, however,

had contacted SKs mother over the phone and had requested her to pick SK

up.

29. It is significant to note that although the learned counsel assigned by the

court to defend the Accused, had represented him on all trial dates, she had

not put a single question in cross-examination and it is recorded at the end

of the examination-in-chief of each Prosecution witness no cross

examination. In short, the Prosecution version went unchallenged.

30. On 18th December 2013, the case took a different turn. When the case was

taken up before the court, the Accused was represented by a different

counsel, Kalinga Ravindra, Attorney-at-Law. The proceedings recorded on

that day, is confusing to say the least. The counsel Kalinga Ravindra had

submitted to court that if a counsel has been assigned [to the Accused] and

if the assigned counsel has been instructed, the case be taken up later

implying that he does not want to represent the Accused and that the

assigned counsel be permitted to continue defending the Accused. When the

case was called for the second time on that day, only the assigned counsel

represented the Accused. It is recorded that the charges on the indictment

were read over to the Accused severally and that the Accused pleaded guilty

to each of the counts severally.

31. The proceedings did not disclose the reasons as to why the indictment was

read over to the Accused for a second time, almost at the tail end of the trial.

This was a matter where, at the inception, the Accused had elected to plead

not guilty. Neither does the record bear out whether the Accused had wished

to withdraw his earlier plea of not guilty not whether he has subsequently

expressed his desire to plead guilty (I have adverted to this aspect later in

this judgment). In fact, there is nothing to indicate that the Accused had

13

withdrawn his previous plea of not guilty, without which the court could

not have recorded a guilty plea.

32. The court, however, had proceeded to record a plea of guilty which was

followed by the submissions by the learned State Counsel with regard to the

imposition of an appropriate sentence on the Accused while the assigned

counsel pleaded in mitigation. Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge

proceeded to impose the following sentence.

33. In respect of the counts of kidnapping, under Section 354 of the Penal Code,

(Counts 1, 3 and 5) a sentence of 7 years rigorous imprisonment on each

count (to run consecutively), a total of 21 years was imposed on the Accused.

7 years is the maximum sentence that is prescribed for the offence of

kidnapping, under Section 354 of the Penal Code.

34. In respect of the counts of Rape, under Section 364(2) of the Penal code

(counts 2, 4 and 6) the Accused was imposed a sentence of 20 years rigorous

imprisonment on each count (to run consecutively), amounting to a total of

60 years. The maximum term of imprisonment that is prescribed for the

offence of Rape under Section 364(2) is also 20 years.

35. Cumulatively, a sentence of 81 years rigorous imprisonment was imposed

on the Accused.

36. In addition, fines totalling to Rs.7500/= with a default sentence of 1 years

simple imprisonment and compensation in a sum of Rs.150, 000/= payable

to SK, with a default sentence of 3 years simple imprisonment was imposed

on the Accused.

14

The Concept of Fair Trial

37. In the instant appeal, this court is only called upon to consider the issue as

to whether the sentence imposed on the Accused is excessive. Before that

issue is considered, I wish to express certain reservations regarding the

manner in which this case was conducted before the High Court.

38. From the copies of the proceedings made available to this court, as referred

to earlier, no reason was adduced as to why the indictment was read to the

Accused for the second time. Furthermore, this had taken place almost at the

tail end of the Prosecution case, after the evidence of all the lay witnesses

and the expert witness were led. The investigating officer, probably, would

have been the only witness that the Prosecution had had to lead to close its

case. There is no record of the Accused withdrawing his earlier plea of not

guilty. No doubt, the Accused has a right to withdraw his initial plea of not

guilty at any time before the judgement is delivered and a plea of guilty can

be advanced. In such an instance the court has a duty to act cautiously; not

only must the court be satisfied that the withdrawal of the plea is out of the

Accuseds own free will but must also satisfy itself that the withdrawal of the

initial plea was only after having fully understood the consequences of his

act. Further, it is the duty of learned High Court Judge to have it recorded

that the Accused had retracted his earlier plea of not guilty and that the court

is satisfied that the Accused did so having full knowledge of his actions and

the consequences. As the decisions of the High Courts are subject to review

by the appellate courts, it is vital that the procedural steps referred to above

are followed. There are statutory safeguards put in place. One example is

where an Accused is indicted with the offence of murder (Section 296 of the

Penal Code). The court is required to proceed with the trial as if the Accused

had pleaded not guilty, even if the Accused tenders a plea of guilty to the

15

charge [Proviso to Section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act of

1979, hereinafter also referred to as the (CPC)].

39. In terms of Section 183 of the CPC, an Accused is entitled to withdraw his

plea of guilty any time before the sentence is passed, with the leave of the

magistrate. These are safeguards provided by the legislature to prevent any

injustice being caused to an Accused and they cannot be dismissed lightly.

When an Accused pleads guilty, it is not to be taken at its face value, unless

the plea is expressed in an unmistakable term with full appreciation of the

essential ingredients of the evidence.

40. In the case of R.J. Henderson v. T.G. Morgan 426 U.S. 637 (1976), the US

Supreme Court held; Since Respondent (the Accused) did not receive

adequate notice of the offence to which he pleaded guilty, his plea was

involuntary, and the judgment of conviction was entered without due

process of law. (emphasis added) The plea could not be voluntary in the

sense that, it constituted an intelligent admission that he committed the

offence, unless the Respondent received real notice of the true nature of the

charge against him, the first and most universally recognized requirement

of due process. Smith v. O'Grady 312 U.S. 329, 334. Where the record

discloses that defence counsel did not purport to stipulate that the

respondent had the requisite intent or explain to him that his plea would be

admission of that fact, and he made no factual statement or admission

necessarily implying that he had such intent, it is impossible to conclude that

his plea to the unexplained charge of second-degree murder was voluntary.

(pages 2257-2259)

41. Albeit in dissent, Justice Rehnquist summarised the law on the point,

referring to earlier decisions; Out of just consideration for persons accused

16

of crime, Courts are careful that a plea of guilty shall not be accepted unless

made voluntarily after proper advice and with full understanding of the

consequences. (at page 2261)

42. The question presented in the said case of Henderson v. Morgan (supra) was

whether a Defendant may enter a voluntary plea of guilty to a charge of

second-degree murder without (the Defendant) being informed that intent

to cause the death of his victim was an element of the offence.

43. The Respondent was indicted for first-degree murder, but by agreement with

the Prosecution and on counsel's advice, the Respondent pleaded guilty to

second-degree murder and was sentenced. Subsequently, after exhausting

his state remedies in an unsuccessful attempt to have his conviction vacated

on the ground that his guilty plea was involuntary, the Respondent filed a

habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court, alleging that his guilty plea

was involuntary because, inter alia, he was not aware that intent to cause

death was an element of second-degree murder. The District Court

ultimately heard the testimony of several witnesses, including the

Respondent and his defence counsel in the original Prosecution; and the

transcript of the relevant state-court proceedings and certain psychological

evaluations of the Respondent, who was substantially below average

intelligence, were made part of the record. On the basis of the evidence thus

developed, the District Court found that the Respondent had not been

advised by counsel or the state court that an intent to cause death was an

essential element of second-degree murder, and, based on this finding, held

that the guilty plea was involuntary and had to be set aside. Both the Court

17

of Appeals and the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Federal

District Court.

44. Although one might argue that the case of Henderson v. Morgan (supra)

may not be directly on the point that this court is called upon to answer, I

am however, is of the view that, in a perspective, it has a significant bearing

on the case before us.

45. At the commencement, the Accused had pleaded not guilty to the six counts

on the indictment. In the course of the evidence the Prosecution was not able

to establish two out of the three counts of rape. In fact, there is positive

evidence emanating from the victim herself that sexual intercourse did not

take place on two of the occasions referred to in the indictment.

Furthermore, there is a paucity of evidence with regard to the two counts of

kidnapping. One requisite element of the offence of kidnapping is taking a

minor out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor without the

consent of such guardian. When SKs mother testified, she had not been

asked a single question as to whether she did or did not consent to SK being

taken anywhere by the Accused. The only question that was posed to the

mother of SK in relation to the two previous instances (of kidnapping) was

whether SK complained to her about any harassment by the Accused on any

previous occasions, to which she had answered in the negative. With regard

to the offences of kidnapping, apart from the question referred to above, not

a single question was put to the mother of SK although she was the pivotal

witness to establish the charge of kidnapping from lawful guardianship.

18

Application of the Concept of Fair Trial

46. It is evident from the proceedings that the trial in this case commenced and

proceeded before the same judge who heard the entirety of the evidence

placed before court and who convicted and sentenced the Accused on his

guilty plea. Same was the case with the prosecuting State Counsel as well as

the counsel assigned by the court for the Accused. Thus, all of them were

fully aware of SKs version. Although this court did not have the benefit of

observing her demeanour, when one scrutinises her evidence with other

independent material placed, she had spoken truthfully and does not appear

to have suppressed any material evidence. In the circumstances, the learned

High Court judge, the State Counsel as well as assigned counsel,

undoubtedly, were fully aware of the evidence that was before the court to

substantiate the charges and furthermore, what exactly had taken place

between the Accused and SK on the three distinct occasions referred to in the

indictment.

47. As referred to earlier, the record gives no indication as to the circumstances

that led to the indictment being read to the Accused for the second time

(almost at the tail end of the case) and more importantly the record is bereft

of the reasons or circumstances under which the Accused changed his mind

and pleaded guilty to the charges which he pleaded not guilty at the

inception. It is clear from the proceedings that the Accused was virtually

undefended and a reasonable conclusion that can be drawn from the

circumstances is, that the Accused may have acted in sheer desperation to

avoid the inevitable at the conclusion of the trial.

19

48. It is in this backdrop that one needs to consider as to whether the Accused

was afforded a fair trial.

49. As stated above, at the juncture the Accused pleaded guilty to the charges,

not only the learned High Court Judge, but also both the state Counsel and

the assigned counsel were fully aware of the fact, that not only were two of

the rape counts not established, but that there was also positive evidence

negating such incidents having taken place [evidence of SK supported by

medical evidence]. The same could be said with regard to two of the

kidnapping counts as well, due to the paucity of evidence.

50. From the proceedings, it is clear that the assigned counsel, on her part, was

nothing but a passive figure throughout the proceedings and did not put a

single question to any of the Prosecution witnesses in cross examination.

Nothing appears from the record to indicate that she had brought to the

attention of the court that the Prosecution had failed to establish two of the

Rape counts and the kidnapping counts.

51. Naturally the question that comes up is; was the Accused advised by the

assigned counsel that the Prosecution had failed to establish two of the Rape

counts and two of the kidnapping charges before the Accused pleaded

guilty? I do not wish to comment on the professional conduct of the assigned

counsel here as I intend to make a recommendation in that regard, in terms

of Section 43 of the Judicature Act read with the Supreme Court Rules,

independently of this judgement. I wish, however, to make the following

observation. No counsel is compelled by court to undertake the defence of

20

an Accused and its a choice an Attorney-at-Law can exercise. Thus, for

moral reasons or otherwise if a counsel is not comfortable in accepting an

appointment to undertake the defence of an Accused as an assigned

counsel they are free to refrain from undertaking such duties. Once

appointed, however, they cannot shirk their responsibilities and are under a

professional duty, not to act in a manner detrimental to or prejudicial to the

rights of the Accused that, they are defending.

52. Rule 15 of the Supreme Court (Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-

Law) Rules of 1988 stipulates;

On accepting any professional matter from a client or on behalf of any

client, it shall be the duty of an Attorney-at-Law to exercise his skill with due

diligence to the best of his ability and care in the best interests of his client

in such a manner as he may decide and he should do so without regard to

any unpleasant consequences either to himself or to any other person.

Furthermore, he should at all times so act with due regard to his duty to the

Court, Tribunal or any Institution established in the Administration of Justice

before which he appears and to his fellow Attorneys-at-Law opposed to

him.

53. No doubt the duty of a State Counsel is to present the Prosecution in an

effective manner to the best of their ability in furtherance of securing a

conviction, if the evidence can support the charge. The Prosecutor, however,

is an officer of the court and their role is to assist the court to dispense justice.

Thus, it is not for a Prosecutor to ensure a conviction at any cost, but to see

that the truth is elicited, and justice is meted out. A Prosecutor is not expected

to keep out relevant facts either from the court or from the Accused. If the

21

investigation has revealed matters which are favourable to the Accused and

the Accused is unaware of the existence of such facts, it is the bounden duty

of the Prosecutor to make those facts available to the court and to the

defence. Rule 52 of the Supreme Court Rules (Conduct and Etiquette for

Attorneys-at-Law) Rules 1988 requires an Attorney-at-law appearing for

the prosecution to bring to the notice of the court any matter which if

withheld may lead to a miscarriage of justice [emphasis added]. Although

in the case before us nothing was withheld, the learned State Counsel had a

professional obligation to bring to the attention of the court that the

Prosecution had not established two of the Rape counts.

Constitutional Guarantees and the ICCPR Act

54. There is no question that the courts also must respect and give effect to the

constitutional provisions in the conduct of court proceedings, as such

Chapter III of our Constitution relating to fundamental rights is no

exception. Article 4 of the Constitution which provides the form and manner

by which the sovereignty of the people is exercised, in its paragraph (d)

stipulates that the fundamental rights which are by the Constitution

declared and recognised shall be respected, secured and advanced by all

organs of government and shall not be abridged restricted or denied, save in

the manner and to the extent hereinafter provided [emphasis added]. In

my view, when one considers the wording of the sub article, the words

government organs encompass the judiciary as well. Article 13(3)

recognises the entitlement of a person charged with an offence to a fair

trial, a right which the state has an obligation to accord to an Accused

through the courts.

22

55. In the case of The Attorney-General v. Segulebbe Latheef and Another

(2008) 1 SLR 225, Justice J. A. N. de Silva, as he then was, stated (at page

228);

The Constitution by Article 13(3) expressly guarantees the right of a

person charged with an offence to be heard by person or by an

Attorney-at-law at a "fair trial" by a competent court. This right is

recognised obviously for the reason that a criminal trial (subject to an

appeal) is the final stage of a proceeding at the end of which a person

may have to suffer penalties of one sort or another if found guilty. The

right of an accused person to a fair trial is recognized in all the

criminal justice systems in the civilized world. Its denial is generally

proof enough that justice is denied. The right to a fair trial was

formally recognised in International law in 1948 in the United

Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Since 1948 the right to a fair

trial has been incorporated into many national, regional and

international instruments. Like the concept of fairness, a fair trial is

also not capable of a clear definition, but there are certain aspects or

qualities of a fair trial that could be easily identified.

56. His Lordship identifies 13 such rights, stated (at page 229) that the right to

a fair trial amongst other things includes; The accused has a right to be

informed of his rights; If the accused is in indigent circumstances to provide

legal assistance without any charge from the accused, and the right of an

accused not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.

[emphasis added]

57. This position is now statutorily fortified with the enactment of the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 0f

2007 (hereinafter the ICCPR Act). Section 4(1) of the Act, which delineates

the rights of a person accused of an offence lays down that;

23

A person charged with a criminal offence under any written law, shall be

entitled- (f) not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess

guilt. [emphasis is mine].

58. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act,

No. 56 of 2007, an Accused now has a statutory entitlement for a counsel to

defend him:

Section 4. (1) of the ICCPR Act stipulates;

A person charged of a criminal offence under any written law, shall be

entitled

(c) to have legal assistance assigned to him in appropriate cases where the

interest of justice so requires and without any payment by him, where he

does not have sufficient means to pay for such assistance.

Role of the Judge

59. I am mindful of the fact that the judges in criminal courts are burdened with

a heavy case load. That, however, does not excuse the trial judge to not follow

the procedural steps stipulated by law or to disregard the need to ensure that

the Accused is accorded a fair trial, guaranteed by the Constitutional

provisions and other laws.

60. Judges have a duty and are required to control the proceedings adhering to

the aforesaid requirements, and to intervene where necessary to ensure the

proceedings are conducted in a fair manner to all parties concerned. In this

respect the judges need to follow the proceedings closely and should be alive

to the events unfolding before them. If that were the case, the judge ought to

have asked both the assigned counsel and the State Counsel, as to the

justification for the plea of guilty by the Accused in relation to the two rape

24

counts that had not been established by the Prosecution. The entirety of the

evidence had been led on two days, on 5th November 2013 and 27th

November 2013 which was within a span of two weeks. Thus, the evidence

should have been fresh in the mind of the learned High Court judge as well

as the other counsel. The passive role played by the assigned counsel ought

to have been noticed by the learned High Court judge. If the concept of Fair

trial encompasses the right to counsel, the counsel must be an effective

counsel. That component, which is considered as an element of a fair trial,

was visibly missing in the proceedings in relation to this case.

61. William W. Schwarzer in Dealing with Incompetent Counsel- The Trial

Judge's Role UC Hastings College of the Law (1980) states (at page 641);

The frequency with which the issue of ineffective representation has arisen

in recent cases before reviewing courts should alert trial courts to the need

to monitor counsel's performance. These cases clearly suggest that the trial

courts have the duty and the authority to protect the right to effective

counsel. That the trial judge should not hesitate to act to assure the

competent performance of counsel seems to be precisely what the Supreme

Court had in mind in McMann v. Richardson 397 US 759 (1970), when it

said:

[W]e think the matter [whether counsel acted within the range of

competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases], for the most

part, should be left to the good sense and discretion of the trial courts

with the admonition that if the right to counsel guaranteed by the

Constitution is to serve its purpose, defendants cannot be left to the

mercies of the incompetent counsel, and that judges should strive to

maintain proper standards of performance by attorneys who are

representing defendants in criminal cases in their courts. [emphasis

is mine]

25

62. He observes further (at page 650), In presiding over any trial, the judge

seeks to achieve fairness. Where the law affords him discretion in the

application of substantive or procedural rules, fairness normally will guide

its exercise. Since the competence of counsel is an element of a fair trial,

achieving fairness will require the monitoring of counsel's performance and

intervention in appropriate circumstances. [emphasis is mine] This does not

require the judge to evaluate the relative efficacy of trial tactics or to

determine whether counsel's performance should receive a passing grade.

Nor is the trial judge called upon to rule whether counsel's performance

satisfies one of the minimum standards formulated by the appellate courts

or whether a party is being denied effective representation. Instead, his

function is to remedy observed deficiencies before it is too late, resorting

always to the least intrusive measure adequate to the need.

Article 127 of the Constitution

63. It would be a travesty of justice to allow the conviction on the two counts of

Rape and two counts of Kidnapping which had not been established, to

remain. No reasonable court, by any stretch of imagination could have

convicted the Accused of those offences had the trial proceeded to a

conclusion.

64. This court granted Special Leave to Appeal only on one issue relating to

excessiveness of the sentence. In this backdrop, it would be necessary to

consider the powers vested with this court to remedy the injustice caused to

the Accused and to what extent the error could be rectified.

26

65. I am reminded of the words of his Lordship Justice Soza in the case of

Somawathie v. Madawela (1983) 2 SLR 15, at page 31;

If as a result of such persistent and blatant disregard for the provisions of

the law a miscarriage of justice results as here, then this Court will not sit

idly by. Indeed, the facts of this case cry aloud for the intervention of this

Court to prevent what otherwise would be a miscarriage of justice.

66. I am of the opinion that Article 127 which states that the Supreme Court

.shall be the final court of criminal jurisdiction for and within the

Republic of Sri Lanka for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which

shall be committed by the Court of Appeal or any Court of first Instance,

tribunal [emphasis added] is wide enough for this court to intervene

to prevent what otherwise would be a serious miscarriage of justice.

67. As pithily stated in Jennison v. Backer (1972 (1) All E.R. 1006), The law

should not be seen to sit limply, while those who defy it go free and, those

who seek its protection lose hope.

68. The Supreme Court considered its Appellate powers under Article 127 of the

Constitution, in the case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority v. Pieris (1981) 1 S.L.R

101. His Lordship Justice Sharvananda, as he then was, stated (at page108);

Article 127 spells the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. The appellate

jurisdiction extends to the correction of all errors in fact and/or in law

which shall be committed by the Court of Appeal or any court of first

instance. There is no provision inhibiting this Court from exercising its

appellate jurisdiction once that jurisdiction is invoked. On reading

Articles 127 and 128 together, it would appear that once leave to appeal

is granted by the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal and this Court

is seized of the appeal, the jurisdiction of this Court to correct all errors

27

in fact or in law which had been committed by the Court of Appeal or

court of first instance is not limited but is exhaustive.

Leave to appeal is the key which unlocks the door into the Supreme

Court, and once a litigant has passed through the door, he is free to

invoke the appellate jurisdiction of this Court "for the correction of all

errors in fact and/or in law which had been committed by the Court of

Appeal or any court of first instance". This Court, however, has the

discretion to impose reasonable limits to that freedom, such as refusing

to entertain grounds of appeal which were not taken in the court below

and raised for the first time before this Court. This Court in the exercise

of its discretion will, however, look to the broad principles of justice and

will take judicial notice of a point which is patent on the face of the

proceedings and discourage mere technical objections. [emphasis

added]

69. In another case decided shortly after the decision of Sri Lanka Ports Authority

v. Peiris (supra) the Supreme Court said, in the case of Albert v. Veeriahpillai

(1981) 1 SLR 110, at page 113):

Articles 118 [sic] of the constitution provides that the Supreme Court shall

be the highest and final court of record in the Republic and shall, subject to the

provisions of the Constitution, exercise, inter alia final appellate jurisdiction.

Appellate jurisdiction may be exercised by way of appeal or revision. Article

128 of the Constitution prescribes how the appellate jurisdiction of this Court

is invoked by way of appeal. The leave of this Court or of the Court of Appeal

is a sine qua non for a party to come to this Court by way of appeal. But once

leave is granted, on whatever ground it be, the appeal is before this court and

this Court is seized of the appeal. Its appellate jurisdiction extends to the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by the Court

of Appeal or any Court of First Instance (vide Art. 127 of the Constitution).

Therefore, it is competent for this Court to permit parties to bring to its notice

28

errors of law or of fact and raise new contentions or new points of law, or sue

motu to raise them if there is proper foundation for them in the record. Thus,

this Court will allow an appellant to urge before it grounds of appeal not set

out in the application for leave if the material on record warrants the

determination of same. This Court is not hamstrung by the fact that the Court

of Appeal had not granted leave to appeal on the ground urged before the

Supreme Court. [emphasis added]

70. Thus, it is evident that there are clear precedents for this court to act

uninhibited suo motu in the interest of justice where the Court of Appeal or the

court of first instance has clearly misdirected itself which has resulted in a

serious miscarriage of justice, as in the present case.

71. In the circumstances, exercising the powers vested in court by Article 127

of the Constitution, the conviction of and sentences imposed on the Accused,

on counts 1, 2, 3, and 4 are hereby quashed. The conviction of the Accused

on counts 5 and 6 is hereby affirmed.

72. What was challenged in these proceedings, was the quantum of the sentence

imposed. What appears from the evidence is that SK had been distraught due

to a strained relationship with her mother and the Accused had taken

advantage of the situation by developing an intimate relationship with SK. It

is also evident that SK had accompanied the Accused on these jaunts

willingly. Although consent is not a material factor as far as establishing the

charge of rape is concerned, the Accused does not appear to have used force,

although SK has said in her evidence that her clothes were removed forcibly.

From the standpoint of the Accused, his conduct cannot be condoned by any

29

measure. As the stepfather, he had a duty to protect SK but he had acted

otherwise.

73. The High Court Judge, however, had imposed the maximum sentence on

both counts and to run consecutively. Under the circumstances they are

manifestly excessive. As such I set aside the sentences imposed on the

Accused by the learned High Court judge on counts 5 and 6 and substitute

the same with a sentence of 4 years R.I on count 5 (Kidnapping) and a

sentence of 14 years R.I on count 6 (Rape). Both terms of imprisonment to

run concurrently. The fines and compensation imposed by the High Court

Judge and the default sentences imposed, to remain intact. As the Accused

had been in incarceration since the date of conviction, the prison authorities

are directed to compute the commencement of the term of imprisonment,

from the date of incarceration.

E. A. G. R. Amarasekara J.

I agree.

Judge of the Supreme Court

30

P. Padman Surasena J.,

I had the previledge of reading in draft form, the judgment of His Lordship Buwaneka

Aluwihare PC J. I regret my inability to agree with the course of action taken in the

judgment by His Lordship.

Hon. Attorney General had indicted the Accused - Appellant - Appellant in the High

Court of Anuradhapura on six counts.

The said six counts respectively alleged that the Accused - Appellant - Appellant;

I. during the period 2011-12-01 to 2012-02-20, at Tambuththegama,

kidnapped the prosecution witness No. 1, a girl less than 16 years of age,

from the custody of her lawful guardianship and thereby committed an

offence punishable under section 354 of the Penal Code;

II. on the date referred to in count No. 01 above, and in the course of the

same transaction, at Galgamuwa, committed rape of the prosecution

witness No. 1, a girl less than 16 years of age and thereby committed an

offence punishable under section 364 (2) read with section 364 (2) (e)

of the Penal Code;

III. during the period referred to in count No. 01 above, at Tambuththegama,

on a date other than the date referred to in the count No. 01, kidnapped

the prosecution witness No. 1, a girl less than 16 years of age, from the

custody of her lawful guardianship and thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 354 of the Penal Code;

IV. on the date referred to in count No. 03 above, and in the course of the

same transaction, at Galgamuwa, committed rape of the prosecution

witness No. 1, a girl less than 16 years of age and thereby committed an

offence punishable under section 364 (2) read with section 364 (2) (e)

of the Penal Code;

V. on the 21st of February 2012 or on a date closer to the said date, at

Tambuththegama, kidnapped the prosecution witness No. 1, a girl less

31

than 16 years of age, from the custody of her lawful guardianship and

thereby committed an offence punishable under section 354 of the Penal

Code;

VI. on the date referred to in count No. 05 above, and in the course of the

same transaction, at Galgamuwa, committed rape of the prosecution

witness No. 1, a girl less than 16 years of age and thereby committed an

offence punishable under section 364 (2) read with section 364 (2) (e)

of the Penal Code.

On 21-10-2013, the learned High Court Judge had read out the charges to the

Accused - Appellant - Appellant and also assigned Priyanthi Hettiarachchi Attorney-

at-Law to appear for the Accused - Appellant - Appellant at the cost of the state. As

the Accused - Appellant - Appellant had pleaded not guilty to all the charges, the

learned High Court Judge had fixed the case for 05-11-2013 to commence the trial.

Accordingly, the trial had begun on the said date i.e. 05-11-2013. The prosecution

on that date had concluded the evidence of three witnesses including the prosecution

witness No. 1. The learned High Court Judge had then fixed the case for 27-11-2013

to resume the further trial.

On 27-11-2013, the prosecution had concluded the evidence of the Judicial Medical

Officer after which the learned High Court Judge had fixed the case for 04-12-2013

to resume the further trial.

It appears from the journal entry dated 04-12-2013 that the further trial could not

be resumed on that date hence the further trial was re-fixed for another date i.e. 18-

12-2013.

On 18-12-2013, when the case was taken up for further trial, the Accused -

Appellant -Appellant had pleaded guilty to all the six counts in the indictment. This

was before the prosecution closed its case. Accordingly, the learned High Court Judge

had proceeded to convict the Accused - Appellant - Appellant on all counts in the

indictment on his own admission of guilt. Thus, from that point onwards, the only

32

task left for the learned High Court Judge was to decide on an appropriate sentence

to be imposed on the Accused - Appellant - Appellant. Having heard the submissions

of both parties relating to sentencing, the learned High Court Judge had then

proceeded to impose the following sentences on the Accused - Appellant - Appellant.

Count No. 1

Seven (07) years rigorous imprisonment.

Count No. 2

Twenty (20) years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rupees Two thousand five

hundred (2,500/=). One year simple imprisonment in default of the payment of

the said fine was also imposed.

The Accused - Appellant - Appellant was also ordered to pay Rs. 50,000/= as

compensation to the victim. One-year simple imprisonment in default of the

payment of the said compensation was also imposed.

Count No. 3

Seven (07) years rigorous imprisonment.

Count No. 4

Twenty (20) years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rupees Two Thousand Five

Hundred (2,500/=). One-year simple imprisonment in default of the payment of

the said fine was also imposed.

The Accused - Appellant - Appellant was also ordered to pay Rs. 50,000/= as

compensation to the victim. One-year simple imprisonment in default of the

payment of the said compensation was also imposed.

Count No. 5

Seven (07) years rigorous imprisonment.

Count No. 6

33

Twenty (20) years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rupees Two Thousand Five

Hundred (2,500/=). One year simple imprisonment in default of the payment of

the said fine was also imposed.

The Accused - Appellant - Appellant was also ordered to pay Rs. 50,000/= as

compensation to the victim. One-year simple imprisonment in default of the

payment of the said compensation was also imposed.

The learned High Court Judge has further ordered that none of the above terms of

imprisonment shall run concurrently. This means that the Accused - Appellant -

Appellant has to undergo a cumulative period of 81 years rigorous imprisonment

and a further cumulative period of 06 years simple imprisonment in case he

defaults the payment of the fines and the compensation ordered.

Being aggrieved by the order of the learned High Court Judge, the Accused -

Appellant - Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The petition of appeal

submitted to the Court of Appeal dated 31-12-2013 has also been produced

marked P 3 as part and parcel of the petition.

Having considered the arguments presented before it, the Court of Appeal by its

judgment dated 22-05-2017, held that;

i. the Accused - Appellant - Appellant was never misled and he was well aware

of the nature of the charges when he decided to plead guilty;

ii. the performance of the counsel at the trial in the original court is not a

criteria in deciding the appeal;

iii. and hence, there was no reason to interfere with the order of the learned

High Court Judge.

The Court of Appeal on the above basis dismissed the appeal.

Being aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Accused - Appellant -

Appellant filed the instant application for special leave to appeal. He has framed

following questions of law in his petition dated 17th October 2017.

34

a) Did the learned High Court Judge and the learned judges of the Court of

Appeal err in law and in fact by respectively imposing and affirming a term

of rigorous imprisonment for 81 years on the petitioner for two types of

offences included in six counts in the indictment which alleged to have been

committed by the petitioner on the victim within a period of 3 months, i.e.

from December 2010 to 21st February 2011?

b) Did the learned High Court Judge and the learned judges of the Court of

Appeal err in law and in fact by respectively imposing and affirming a term

of rigorous imprisonment for 81 years on the petitioner by failing to consider

the fact that the petitioner pleaded guilty without proceeding with the trial?

c) Did the learned High Court Judge and the learned judges of the Court of

Appeal err in law and in fact by failing to consider the fact that the

indictment was erroneous and defective as counts 1, 2, 3, and 4 did not

appropriately specify date relating to the alleged offences?

d) Did the learned High Court Judge and the learned Judges of the Court of

Appeal err in law and in fact by failing to appreciate that the Petitioner was

deprived of a fair trial which led him to plead guilty where the counsel

assigned by Court failed to discharge his duties to an acceptable standard.

e) Did the learned High Court Judge and the judges of the Court of Appeal err

in law and in fact by failing to consider the fact that imposing a term of

rigorous imprisonment for 81 years for two types of offences included in six

counts in the indictment which alleged to have been committed by the

Petitioner on the victim within a period of 3 months is excessive and against

the well-accepted principles of sentencing and theories of punishment? 1

Perusal of the averments in the petition presented by the Accused - Appellant -

Appellant to this Court, shows clearly that he had admitted the fact that he pleaded

guilty separately to all the six counts in the indictment on 18-12-2013. He has

further stated in his petition2 that he honestly believed that the learned High Court

1 Quoted from paragraph 23 of the petition dated 17th October 2017. 2 Paragraph 8 of the afore-said petition.

35

judge would take into consideration, the fact that he had pleaded guilty to all the

counts in the indictment, when deciding the quantum of the sentence to be imposed

on him.

Moreover, paragraphs 14 and 15 of the petition presented to this court by the

Accused - Appellant - Appellant shows clearly that his main concern, complaint

and focus in his application for special leave, is on the quantum of the sentences

imposed on him. The said paragraphs are quoted below for easy reference.

14. Being aggrieved by the above sentence imposed by the learned High Court

Judge of Anuradhapura, the Petitioner states that the Petitioner preferred an

appeal to the Court of Appeal on 31-12-2013 inter alia on the following

grounds;

a) The sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge on the Petitioner was

excessive,

b) The sentence imposed on the Petitioner was erroneous as the learned High

Court Judge has not considered the principles in section 303 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act as amended and the fact that the Petitioner did not

have any previous convictions or pending cases against him.

c) The trial held against the Petitioner was illegal as the indictment filed against

the Petitioner was erroneous and misconceived.

15. Accordingly, the Petitioner, by his petition of appeal, prayed for inter alia;

a) To declare that the sentence of 81 years of rigorous imprisonment imposed

by the learned High Court Judge on the Petitioner on 18-12-2013 was

erroneous,

b) To alter the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge on the

Petitioner on 18-12-2013 and to make a suitable order,

36

c) To acquit the Petitioner. 3

The afore-said leave to appeal application was supported before this bench firstly on

23-10-2019 and then on 28-01-2020.4 (This bench commenced hearing

submissions of counsel on 23-10-2019 and concluded it on 28-01-2020). Having

heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for both parties, this bench by its order

dated 28-01-2020, has granted special leave to appeal only in respect of the question

of law set out in sub paragraph (e) of paragraph 23 of the Petition dated 17-10-2017.

The journal entry dated 28-01-2020 is reproduced below for clarity.

37

Judgement reserved by Hon. B. P. Aluwihare PC J.

The said question of law referred to in paragraph 23 (e) of the Petition is reproduced

below.

(e) Did the learned High Court Judge and the judges of the Court of Appeal

err in law and in fact by failing to consider the fact that imposing a term of

rigorous imprisonment for 81 years for two types of offences included in six

counts in the indictment which alleged to have been committed by the

Petitioner on the victim within a period of 3 months is excessive and against

the well-accepted principles of sentencing and theories of punishment.

Thus, as stated in paragraph 11 of the draft judgment of His Lordship Aluwihare PC

J, it was in the above circumstances that this Court immediately after granting special

leave to appeal on the question of law set out in paragraph 23 (e) of the Petition, on

the same day, proceeded to hear parties on the question of law. It was thereafter that

His Lordship Aluwihare PC J reserved the judgment.

The said paragraph 11 is quoted below for easy reference.

As the question of law is confined only to the issue of the imposition of an

excessive sentence, both the learned counsel for the Petitioner as well as the

learned Deputy Solicitor General agreed to make submissions on behalf of the

respective parties on the afore-stated question of law with a view to an early

disposal of this matter. Accordingly, this court, acting under the proviso to

Rule 16(1) of the Supreme Court Rules, dispensing with the requirement of

complying with the provisions of the Rules regarding the steps preparatory to

the hearing of the appeal, heard the learned counsel on the very day that

Special Leave to Appeal was granted.

Thus, it is clear that this bench on 28-01-2020 decided that special leave to appeal in

respect of the questions of law set out in paragraph 23 (a) to (d) of the above

mentioned petition must not be granted. This was after hearing the submissions of

counsel for both parties firstly on 23-10-2019 and then on 28-01-2020.

38

It would be opportune at this stage, to reproduce Rule 16 (1) of the Supreme Court

Rules. It is as follows.

.. If special leave to appeal is granted, the Court shall, after consulting the parties,

or their attorneys-at-law if any, forthwith fix the date or dates of hearing of the

appeal. If the Court for any reason does not fix the date of hearing, the date or dates

of hearing shall be fixed by the Registrar on the date fixed in terms of sub-rule (2),

after consulting the parties present and obtaining their assessment of the likely

duration of the argument;

Provided that the Court may, with the consent of the parties or their attorneys-at-

law, proceed to hear and determine the appeal, either forthwith or on another date

to be then fixed, dispensing with compliance with the provisions of these rules in

regard to the steps preparatory to the hearing of such appeal.

Therefore, in the instant case it is clear that both parties of this case consented for

this Court to proceed to hear this appeal only on the question of law in respect of

which this Court granted special leave to appeal.

Thus, it was in the above circumstances, that this Court as per the proviso to the

above Rule proceeded to hear the submissions of the parties only in respect of the

question of law set out in paragraph 23 (e) of the petition on the same day. This,

no doubt, gave both parties the impression that this Court would not consider the

correctness of the conviction but would only confine its judgment to the question

of the quantum of the sentence imposed on the Accused - Appellant - Appellant.

I would now proceed to consider the question of law in respect of which this Court

has granted special leave to appeal.

As has been mentioned above, according to the order of the learned High Court

Judge, it is imperative for the Accused - Appellant - Appellant to undergo a

cumulative period of 81 years rigorous imprisonment. In case he defaults the

payment of the fines and the compensation ordered, he also has to undergo a

further cumulative period of 06 years simple imprisonment.

39

It is clear that the learned High Court Judge has imposed the maximum term of

imprisonment provided in the penal sections of the relevant offences with which

the Accused - Appellant - Appellant was charged. This is despite the Accused -

Appellant - Appellant had pleaded guilty to all the charges.

There is no doubt that the sentences imposed on the Accused - Appellant -

Appellant are manifestly excessive. Since it is manifest by itself, I need not further

elaborate on its excessive nature.

Further the order made by the learned High Court Judge preventing to run the

sentences imposed in respect of each count concurrently has also resulted in a

further enhancement of the already excessive sentences imposed on the Accused -

Appellant - Appellant.

Thus, I answer the said question of law referred to in paragraph 23 (e) of the

Petition in the affirmative.

In these circumstances, I set aside the sentences imposed on the Accused - Appellant

- Appellant by the learned High Court Judge. I substitute therefore, the following

The Accused - Appellant - Appellant is also ordered to pay Rs. 50,000/= as

compensation to the victim. Three (03) months simple imprisonment in default of

the payment of the said compensation is also imposed.

I further order that the main terms of imprisonment imposed on the Accused -

Appellant - Appellant i. e. each of the terms of 04 years imposed in respect of counts

01, 03 and 05 and also each of the terms of 10 years imposed in respect of counts

02, 04 and 06 shall run concurrently. Thus, the cumulative period of the said main

terms of imprisonment would be 10 years.

The said cumulative period of the said main terms of imprisonment (10 years RI)

must be taken as having run from the date of the conviction i.e. 18-12-2013. This

is because I observe that the Accused - Appellant - Appellant has been in remand

41

to date since 18-12-2013 i. e. the date on which the learned High Court Judge

sentenced him.
