Decided on : 8th September, 2020

Priyantha Jayawardena, PC, J

Facts of the case

The 1st to the 4th petitioners filed the instant application alleging that the denial to promote

them to the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police [hereinafter referred to as ASP] is

an infringement of their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

At the time of filing the instant application, the 1st to 4th petitioners were serving as Chief

Inspectors of Police [hereinafter referred to as CI].

6

The Cabinet of Ministers had approved the Amended Scheme of Recruitment and Promotions

of Senior Gazetted Officers of the Police Department [hereinafter referred to as Amended

Scheme of Promotions] on the 5th of August, 1998, and it had been communicated to the

Inspector General of Police, the 9th respondent, by letter dated 20th of August, 1998. The said

letter and the Amended Scheme of Promotions were produced along with the petition, marked

as P1.

In terms of the said Amended Scheme of Promotions: 25% of the vacancies were to be filled

on the basis of results of an Open Competitive Examination, 25% of the vacancies were to be

filled on the basis of the results of a Limited Competitive Examination and the balance 50%

of the vacancies were to be filled on the basis of Merit Promotions from among the CIs who

are confirmed in the rank.

The promotions made only on the basis of Merit Promotions will be considered in this

judgment as the scope of the instant application is in respect of promotions granted on merit

basis.

In terms of the said Amended Scheme of Promotions, marked as P1, the selection procedure

for merit promotions was a viva voce test before a Board of Interview appointed by the Public

Service Commission. Further, it stipulated that to be eligible to apply under the category of

Merit Promotions, the candidates should be CIs who are confirmed in the said rank and in

possession of an unblemished record for the five-year period immediately preceding the closing

date of applications.

Thereafter, the Inspector General of Police by Circular dated 24th of July 2007, marked as

P2(a), had called applications to fill vacancies in the rank of ASP from CIs who were

promoted to the said rank on or before the 1st of January, 2003 and confirmed in the said rank.

The said Circular had stipulated that in order to be eligible for the said promotion the applicants

should possess an unblemished record of service during the five-year period immediately

before 10th of August, 2007 which was the closing date of applications.

Further, the said Circular had stated that eligible candidates should collect both the application

form and the marking scheme produced marked as P2(b), [hereinafter referred to as the first

marking scheme], and that the candidates will be summoned before a Board of Interview as

the method of assessment for promotions.

7

The petitioners stated that they submitted applications in response to the abovementioned

Circular to be considered for promotion to the rank of ASP.

However, the Inspector General of Police, by Circular dated 20th of March 2008, marked as

P3(a), had informed that fresh applications should be submitted on or before the 31st of

March, 2008 by CIs whose names were included in an annexed list thereto to be considered for

promotion to the rank of ASP on Merit basis.

Further, the said Circular calling for the fresh applications stated that a new marking scheme

for the selection of ASPs on Merit basis had been approved by the National Police Commission.

The said marking scheme was produced along with the Petition, marked as P3(b) [hereinafter

referred to as the second marking scheme].

In view of the above, to be eligible for promotion to the rank of ASP, the candidates were

required to be CIs who are promoted to the rank of CI on or before the 1st of January, 2003 and

confirmed in the said rank. Further, the candidates were to possess an unblemished record of

service during the past five-year period immediately before the 31st of March, 2008 which is

the closing date of applications.

The petitioners stated that they submitted fresh applications for the second time as their names

had been included in the said annexed list of the said Circular dated 20th of March, 2008. Both

sets of said applications submitted by the petitioners had been produced along with the Petition,

marked as P6 to P9.

Subsequently, the Inspector General of Police had informed, by Circular dated 2nd of June 2008,

that the National Police Commission once again had approved another amended marking

scheme and communicated the said decision by its letter dated 30th of May, 2008 and that the

said amended marking scheme was available to the CIs who had submitted applications for

promotion to the rank of ASP on Merit basis.

Both the said Circular dated 2nd of June, 2008 and the amended marking scheme [hereinafter

referred to as the third marking scheme] were produced with the Petition marked as P4(a)

and P4(b), respectively.

However, the Secretary of the National Police Commission had issued another marking scheme

[hereinafter referred to as the fourth marking scheme] for the selection of CIs to the rank of

ASP under merit basis on the 16th of October, 2008. The said fourth marking scheme was

8

produced along with the Petition, marked as P5. The interview under reference had been held

in accordance with the said marking scheme of P5.

Subsequently, all candidates had been requested to be present before a Board of Interview by

Circulars dated 24th and 26th of October 2008, produced marked as P10(a) and P10(b),

respectively. The said list included both female and male candidates.

Subsequent to the conclusion of the said interviews, the list of officers promoted to the rank of

ASP with effect from the 1st of January, 2008 had been released on the 1st of January, 2009 by

the Inspector General of Police after the same was approved by the National Police

Commission. The said list of promotees had been produced along with the Petition, marked as

P11.

The petitioners stated that even though the said list did not include their names, several officers,

who did not meet the eligibility criteria stipulated in the Amended Scheme of Promotions and

marking scheme, marked as P1 and P5, had been included as promotees to the rank of ASP.

The petitioners further stated that calling for fresh applications for the same vacancies and the

changing of the marking schemes were to suit the requirements of some of the selected

candidates to enable them to score higher marks than the other candidates.

Further, the petitioners stated that the 17th and 18th respondents, two female CIs, despite scoring

lower marks than the petitioners at the said interview have been promoted to the rank of ASP

on Merit basis.

In the circumstances, the petitioners stated that they were discriminated against and/or were

not treated equally with other candidates who were promoted to the rank of ASP under Merit

basis. Furthermore, the petitioners stated that they were entitled to be promoted to the rank of

ASP on Merit basis.

In the aforesaid circumstances, the petitioners stated that the failure and/or the refusal to

promote the petitioners from the rank of CI to ASP was arbitrary, capricious and therefore, in

violation of their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Subsequent to the filing of the instant application, the learned Deputy Solicitor General brought

to the notice of court that the 1st and 2nd petitioners had been promoted to the rank of ASP, on

the basis of seniority, with effect from 9th May, 2010 and that the 3rd petitioner had been

9

promoted to the rank of ASP, on the basis of period of service and skill, with effect from 13th

January, 2014.

However, the petitioners submitted that even though the petitioners were promoted at a later

date, the selection process in issue was flawed and it has adversely affected their seniority.

Particularly, candidates with lower marks and who were junior to the petitioners have been

promoted over them. As such, the petitioners informed court that they would proceed with this

instant application.

Further, this court had been informed that the 4th petitioner was promoted to the rank of ASP,

effective from the 13th of January 2014, by letter No. PSC/APP/8/2/56/2012 dated 14th of

March, 2014 issued by the Public Service Commission. However, the 4th petitioner had passed

away on the 15th of March, 2014 whilst attempting to disperse a group of protestors in the

Nugegoda area. Thereafter, in terms of Circular Nos. 2197/2009 and 16/2009, by letter No.

MinLO/POL/12/03/2014 dated 17th of March, 2014 the 4th petitioner was promoted

posthumously to the rank of Superintendent of Police (Grade II) effective from the 16th of

March, 2014. In the circumstances, the learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioners informed

court that he will not be pursuing the application on behalf of the 4th petitioner.

Thus, this judgment will only consider the alleged infringement of Fundamental Rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of Constitution of the 1st to 3rd petitioners.

Moreover, since the petitioners had agreed not to object to the promotions already granted to

the 21st and 25th respondents, this court had made order discharging the said respondents from

the instant application on the 18th of December, 2015. Hence, the promotions granted to them

will not be considered in this judgment.

Further, the scope of this judgment will be restricted to the rights of the petitioners, applying

the principle in Liyanage & Another vs Ratnasiri - Divisional Secretary, Gampaha & Others,

[2013] 1 SLR 6, where it was held that the law assists those who are vigilant and not those

who sleep over their rights.

Affidavit/Objections of 1(I) respondent

The 1(I) respondent, the Secretary to the Public Service Commission filed an Affidavit and

stated that according to the Amended Scheme of Promotions, marked as P1, applications had

been called for the promotion to the rank of ASP by Circular dated 24th of July 2007, marked

10

as P2(a), from CIs who were confirmed in the said rank on or before 1st of January, 2003 and

possessed an unblemished record of service during a period of five years prior to the closing

date for applications.

Further, the 1(I) respondent stated that in response to the said calling for applications, reserved

CIs who were absorbed to the Regular Force with effect from 1st of January, 2006 on a policy

decision of the Government had also submitted their applications.

The 1(I) respondent further stated that the National Police Commission, in consideration of the

numerous representations made to it, had directed the Inspector General of Police to prepare a

consolidated seniority list of CIs and to circulate it among all stakeholders, and that until such

time, it had decided to postpone the promotion process.

The 1(I) respondent stated that upon the finalisation and the circulation of the said seniority

list, on the directions of the National Police Commission, the Inspector General of Police had

called for fresh applications for promotion of CI to the rank of ASP by Circular dated 20th of

March 2020, marked as P3(a).

The 1(I) respondent further stated that all the candidates had been requested to submit

applications on both occasions for the promotion to the rank of ASP in view of the

aforementioned circumstances, and that the petitioners were not the only candidates who were

requested to submit applications twice.

Subsequently, the National Police Commission had amended the marking scheme twice for the

promotion to the rank of ASP on 2nd of June, 2008 and 16th of June, 2008. The said marking

schemes had been produced with the petition, marked as P4b and P5, respectively.

It was stated that the said amendments to the marking scheme was made by the National Police

Commission based on the representations made by, inter alia, the Inspector General of Police

and the Police Inspectors Association, and that on every such occasion, the amended marking

schemes had been made available to all candidates, including the petitioners, through the

Inspector General of Police. It was further submitted that none of the petitioners had objected

to any of the revised marking schemes.

The 1(I) respondent stated that such amendments to the marking scheme had been necessitated

in view of the aforesaid circumstances and not for the purpose of favouring any candidates as

alleged by the petitioners.

11

The 1(I) respondent stated that according to the marks given at the interview the petitioners

have obtained the following marks at the interview:

1st petitioner - 61 marks

2nd petitioner - 65.5 marks

3rd petitioner - 64 marks

4th petitioner - 65 marks (now deceased)

The final marks sheet was produced, marked as 1IR2.

Moreover, it was stated that the cut-off mark for the said promotion had been 73 out of 100

marks and the petitioners had failed to obtain sufficient marks to secure promotions to the rank

of ASP.

Further, in terms of the said marks sheet, the respondents had received the following marks at

the said interview:

15th respondent - 73.5 marks

16th respondent - 73.0 marks

17th respondent - 61.5 marks (female CI)

18th respondent - 55 marks (female CI)

19th respondent - 73.5 marks

20th respondent - 78.0 marks

21st respondent - 80.5 marks (discharged from proceedings)

22nd respondent - 73.5 marks (discharged from proceedings)

23rd respondent - 73.5 marks (discharged from proceedings)

24th respondent - 60.5 marks (discharged from proceedings)

25th respondent - unable to ascertain the marks from the pleadings (discharged

from proceedings)

The marks and other details with regard to the 21st to 25th respondents will not be considered

in this judgment as they were discharged from the proceedings of the instant application.

In view of the above, the 1(I) respondent stated that the 15th, 16th, 19th and 20th respondents

were duly promoted to the rank of ASP as they had obtained 73.5, 73.0, 73.5 and 78.0 marks

respectively and were placed above the said cut-off mark of 73.

12

As stated above, the 17th and the 18th respondents had obtained 61.5 and 55 marks respectively.

The 1(I) respondent stated that a cadre was specially created for female officers with the

approval of the Department of Management Services and the said 17th and 18th respondents

were promoted to the rank of ASP under the said special cadre.

The 1(I) respondent further stated that at present male and female officers serving in the rank

of ASP are placed on a separate cadre and a separate seniority list.

However, the said separate cadre was neither produced nor were further details on the said

cadre given by the 1(I) respondent.

In the circumstances, the 1(I) respondent stated that the petitioners have failed to establish any

infringement of Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Written Submissions of the petitioners

The petitioners submitted that a separate cadre for female officers as stated by the 1(I)

respondent does not exist and that the respondents had failed to produce material to prove the

existence of such a female cadre.

It was further submitted that even if approval of the Department of Management Services has

been obtained to establish the said female ASP cadre as stated by the 1(I) respondent, the said

Department has no authority to create cadres in the Police Service.

Further, it was submitted that consequent to a settlement reached in SC/FR Application No.

600/2003, the Seniority List, produced marked as P12, was used as the basis to promote 351

officers from the rank of Inspector of Police to the rank of CI effective from the 1st of January,

2003. The said Seniority List had placed all the 1363 male and female officers serving in the

grade of Inspector of Police as at 25th of December, 2003 in the same cadre, regardless of any

gender-based classification.

Further, after the said promotion from the rank of Inspector of Police to the rank of CI, all male

and female CIs, regardless of their gender differences, continued to remain in service on the

same cadre and the same order of seniority.

Hence, the petitioners submitted that those who have previously been in one category cannot

be treated differently for the granting of promotions to the rank of ASP.

13

In support of their contention, the petitioners cited the case of Ramupillai v. Festus Perera,

Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and Home Affairs and others, (1991)

1 SLR 11.

In the circumstances, the petitioners stated that their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under

Article 12(1) have been infringed by the failure to promote them to the rank of ASP along with

the other selected candidates who faced the interview along with them.

Further, the petitioners submitted that D. Gurusinghe and W.S.S.P.P. De Silva, who had been

awarded 71 marks and 71.5 marks, respectively, by the said Board of Interview, had challenged

the marks awarded at the interview by filing SC/FR Application No. 121/2009 and SC/FR

Application No. 68/2009. After hearing the parties, the court has ordered the said candidates to

be promoted to the rank of ASP with effect from the 1st of January, 2008 along with the other

selectees of the promotions under reference.

The three main issues to be considered in the instant application are: promoting the 17th and

18th respondents over the petitioners despite scoring lower marks than the petitioners at the

interview, calling for fresh applications for the second time by Circular dated 20th of March,

2008 and the continuous alteration of the marking scheme after closing of applications.

Promoting the 17th and 18th respondents

The petitioners stated that the 17th and 18th female respondents were in the same cadre along

with the other candidates whilst serving in the rank of CI prior to applying for the promotion

to the rank of ASP. However, they had been promoted to the rank of ASP despite receiving

lower marks than the petitioners at the interview.

The 1(I) respondent stated, in paragraph 29(b) of his Affidavit, that the said 17th and 18th

respondents were promoted to the rank of ASP under a separate cadre which was specially

created for female officers with the approval of the Department of Management Services

[Emphasis Added].

However, the petitioner denied the said position and submitted that the Department of

Management Services does not have the legal authority to give the final approval for the

creation of a cadre.

14

Thus, it is necessary to consider whether there is a valid special cadre for female ASPs in the

Sri Lanka Police Force at the time the 17th and 18th respondents were promoted to the rank of

ASP.

Prior to the enactment of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution, the powers pertaining to the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers were

vested with the Public Service Commission.

With the enactment of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution on the 3rd of October 2001, the

said powers were vested with the National Police Commission. However, subsequent to the

repeal of the 17th Amendment by the 18th Amendment to the Constitution on the 9th of

September 2010, the said powers of the National Police Commission were reverted to the

Public Service Commission.

Further, with the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution on the 15th of May 2015,

the said powers were once again vested with the National Police Commission.

The Department of Management Service is a Department in the Ministry of Finance established

[t]o provide the necessary management service assistance to the public sector organizations

to maintain an optimum cadre. Particularly, to decide on the allocation of finances, and

consider the financial implications of creating new cadres.

Thus, the said Department is only one of the approving agencies which has the power to grant

approval to create cadre vacancies. It has no power or authority to grant the final approval for

the creation of new cadre vacancies.

In the circumstances, it is evident that the Department of Management Services does not have

the sole authority to approve the establishment of a separate cadre in the Sri Lanka Police Force

as the said authority was vested with the National Police Commission or the Public Service

Commission, as the case may be, during the period specified above.

The 1(I) respondent further stated, in paragraph 31 of his Affidavit, that at present there are

separate cadres for female and male officers in the rank of ASP and the female officers are

placed on a separate seniority list [Emphasis Added]. However, the 1(I) respondent did not

produce any material before this court to establish that such a cadre was created for female

ASPs prior to the promotions under reference were made.

15

In the instant application, applications for the promotion to the rank of ASP had been first

called by Circular dated 24th of July, 2007 from CIs who were promoted to the said rank by the

1st of January, 2003 based on the said Amended Scheme of Promotions. The first marking

scheme was issued therewith.

Subsequently, fresh applications were called for the second time by Circular dated 20th of

March, 2008 and the second marking scheme had been issued therewith. The said second

marking scheme had again been amended twice by the third marking scheme dated 2nd of June,

2008 and the fourth marking scheme dated 16th of October, 2008.

On both occasions, the applications were called from CIs who were promoted to the said rank

on or before the 1st of January, 2003 and confirmed in the said rank, and no distinction was

drawn between male and female candidates when calling for applications for the said

promotions.

Thereafter, interviews have been called by Circulars dated 24th and 26th of October, 2008

whereby all candidates have been informed of the date on which they were required to come

before the Board of Interview.

Upon perusal of the Circulars dated 24th and 26th of October, 2008, marked as P10(a) and

P10(b), it is evident that all female and male candidates were requested to be present before

the Board of Interview to be considered for the promotion to the rank of ASP. None of the said

documents refer to any special cadre based on gender or otherwise for the promotion to the

rank of ASP. Further, there is no material to show that a gender-based classification was made

either at the time the applications were called or at the time the interviews were held.

Further, consequent to a settlement entered in SC/FR Application No. 600/2003, the seniority

list of Regular Police officers serving in the rank of Inspector of Police as at 25th of December,

2003 had been prepared without any gender-based classification and the officers therewith had

been promoted to the rank of CI with effect from the 1st of January, 2003.

Thereafter, all the male and female officers serving in the rank of CI had continued to be in the

same cadre until the applications for promotion to the rank of ASP were called and the

interviews for the promotion to the rank of ASP were held.

In the case of Ramupillai v. Festus Perera, Minister of Public Administration, Provincial

Councils and Home Affairs and others, (1991) 1 SLR 11 at p.26, it was held:

16

It is clear: that the state is free to decide upon the sources from which either

admissions to educational institutions or recruitments to the Public Sector are to

be made. :that once such selections are made, those taken in from such

sources are integrated into one common class: that thereafter such appointees

are clubbed together into a common stream of service and cannot thereafter

be treated differently for purposes of promotion by referring to the consideration

that they were recruited from different sources: that their genetic blemishes

disappear once they are integrated into a common class and cannot be revived

so as to make equals unequal once again: that there should be no further

classification amongst them, except upon certain acceptable criteria such as

educational qualifications. [Emphasis Added]

In such circumstances, there is a heavy burden on the respondents to establish that even though

the said documents, pertaining to the eligibility of candidates, marking scheme and the calling

of interviews, were commonly applicable to all male and female candidates, there was in fact

a special cadre for the rank of the female ASPs at the time the promotions under reference were

made enabling female candidates to be considered separately for promotion to the rank of ASP.

However, in the instant application, the respondents have failed to discharge the said burden

by producing material before this court to prove the same.

Further, the position taken up by the 1(I) respondent that a female cadre was created for the

rank of female ASPs with the approval of the Department of Management Services is untenable

in law for the reasons stated above.

Therefore, I am of the view that the 17th and 18th respondents who were promoted to the rank

of ASP had not been promoted based on a different cadre applicable to women. As such, the

cut-off mark applicable to the promotions should have been applicable to all the candidates

including the 17th and 18th respondents as well.

Moreover, according to the material produced in the instant application, the Sri Lanka Police

Force has had the same cadre for both male and female officers and all the candidates were

serving as CIs in the same cadre. Thus, even if a special cadre was created for female officers

for the rank of ASP, advance notice should have been given to the candidates about the new

cadre as it is a deviation from the previous scheme of promotions that was in existence in the

This court has consistently held the significance of providing advance notice when a change in

an established procedure is effected by an administrative authority. In Guneratne and others

v Sri Lanka Telecom and others [1993] 1 Sri L.R. 109 at page 118, it was held:

If it is desired to give preferential treatment to [the graduate clerks] in the

interest of the service and for utilizing their skills, the Corporation could do so

on the basis of relevant qualifications, with reasonable notice to those affected

and without prejudicing the legitimate expectations of clerks who are on the verge

of promotion under the previous schemes. [Emphasis Added]

At the interview, the 17th and 18th respondents had scored 61.5 and 55 marks, respectively. The

1st to 3rd petitioners had scored 61, 65.5 and 64 marks, respectively.

However, the 17th and 18th respondents have been promoted over the petitioners

notwithstanding the fact that the 2nd and 3rd petitioners have obtained higher marks than both

the 17th and 18th respondents and that the 1st petitioner has obtained higher marks than the 18th

respondent.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the promotion of the 17th respondent who scored

lower marks than the 2nd and 3rd petitioners and the promotion of the 18th respondents who

scored lower marks than the 1st to 3rd petitioners are an infringement of the Fundamental Rights

of the petitioners guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The effect of calling for fresh applications after the closing of applications

The Amended Scheme of Promotions dated 20th of August, 1998 and the said four marking

schemes, stipulated that for a candidate to be eligible to be promoted to the rank of ASP on

Merit Promotions:

Candidates should be,

(a) Chief Inspectors of Police,

(b) who are confirmed in the rank, and

(c) in possession of an unblemished record of service during the five-year period

immediately before the closing date of applications. [Emphasis Added]

18

In view of the above, the requirement to have an unblemished record for a period of five years

immediately before the closing date of applications had been a vital factor to be considered for

the promotion to the rank of ASP under the merit scheme.

The closing date of applications as referred to in the Circular dated 24th of July, 2007 by which

applications were first called was the 10th of August, 2007.

Thus, in terms of the said first marking scheme candidates who possessed unblemished records

for the period from the 10th of August, 2002 to 10th of August, 2007 were entitled to apply for

the said promotion.

However, applications had been called once again for the same promotions by circular dated

20th of March, 2008 and the closing date for the applications had been fixed as the 31st of

March, 2008.

Therefore, in terms of the said second marking scheme, candidates who possessed blemished

records from the 11th of August, 2002 to 31st of March, 2003 became entitled to apply for the

said promotion.

However, it is pertinent to note that when applications were called for a second time, the

requirement on eligibility pertaining to the date of promotion to the rank of CI was not changed

and remained to be the 1st of January, 2003.

The petitioners submitted that calling for fresh applications for the second time allowed

candidates who had been ineligible to apply for the promotion process due to blemished records

in the first instance to become eligible to apply in the second instance as their blemished records

have got cleared off due to the extension of the closing date of the applications for the same

promotion process by nearly 8 months.

In the circumstances, calling for fresh applications for the second time and postponing the

closing date of applications may have resulted in CIs who were ineligible to apply in the first

instance due to blemished records becoming eligible to apply for the same promotion in the

second instance.

However, even though the petitioners have referred to such matters, no material was produced

to establish that any of the promotees who had blemished records at the time of closing of the

applications on the 10th of August, 2007 benefitted from the postponement of the closing date

of applications to the 31st of March, 2008.

19

In passing, I wish to note that the respondents failed to give any explanation as to why the

requirement on eligibility pertaining to the date of promotion to the rank of CI remained to be

the 1st of January, 2003 even though the requirement of possession of an unblemished record

was advanced/extended from the 10th of August, 2007 to 31st of March, 2008.

The effect of the continuous changing of the marking scheme

The first marking scheme for the promotion process under reference was issued by Circular

dated 24th of July, 2007. Subsequently, the said first marking scheme had been amended by

the following:

a. second marking scheme dated 20th of March 2008,

b. third marking scheme dated 2nd of June 2008, and,

c. fourth marking scheme dated 16th of October, 2008.

All four abovementioned marking schemes applicable for promotions based on merit have

allocated 50 marks each for two categories: Seniority and Merit basis.

The first marking scheme dated 24th of July, 2007 consisted of two main criteria under the

category of Seniority: i.e. Period of Service and Service stipulation ranging from previous

rank.

The said criterion of Period of Service, in the first marking scheme had allocated a maximum

of 35 marks for the years of service in the rank of CI, and the criterion Service stipulation

ranging from previous rank had allocated a maximum of 15 marks for the years of service in

the rank of Inspector of Police.

However, the said fourth marking scheme, marked as P5, had amalgamated the said two

criteria under the heading Period of Service for 50 marks. It had also:

(a) increased the marks awarded for each year of completed service in the rank of Inspector

of Police from 1 mark to 2 marks,

(b) added a new heading awarding marks for the years of service in the rank of Sub-

Inspector with 1 mark allocated for each year of service, and

(c) removed the maximum of 15 marks allocated under the first marking scheme for the

years of service completed in the rank of Inspector of Police.

20

Further, marks were awarded to candidates at the interview by the Board of Interview based on

the said fourth marking scheme dated 16th of October 2008, marked as P5.

Hence, the said fourth marking scheme has facilitated candidates to score more marks for

periods served in the ranks of Inspector of Police and Sub-Inspector of Police than under

the first marking scheme.

In view of the above, the alteration of the marking scheme has resulted in depriving candidates

who have served a longer period in the rank of CI of scoring more marks than some of the

candidates under the category of Seniority stipulated in the first marking scheme.

In the circumstances, it is evident that the alterations in the marking scheme after the closing

date of the applications had placed some candidates in a more favourable position than the

other candidates.

Thus, I am of the view that in order to protect the fairness and the transparency of the

promotions process, the administrative authorities should not change the Scheme of

Promotions and/or marking schemes after the closing of the applications unless there are

compelling reasons to do so.

A similar view was expressed by Supreme Court of India in the case of Maharashtra State

Road Transport Corporation v. Rajendra Bhimrao Mandve, AIR 2002 Supreme Court 224

at page 226, which stated:

It has been repeatedly held by this Court that the games of the rules meaning

thereby, that the criteria for selection cannot be altered by the authorities

concerned in the middle or after the process of selection has commenced.

Moreover, in the instant application, the Amended Scheme of Promotions, based on which the

promotion process under reference was issued, had been given approval by the Cabinet of

Ministers on the 5th of August, 1998. However, applications for the said promotion process

were first called on the 24th of July, 2007 from CIs who were promoted to the said rank on or

before the 1st of January, 2003 which was nearly 9 years after the said Amended Scheme of

Promotions.

Thereafter, fresh applications had been called once again for the second time on the 20th of

March, 2008 for the same promotions after closing the applications on the 10th of August, 2007.

21

The interviews for the said promotions were held from the 14th of November, 2008 to the 10th

of December, 2008 and the list of promotees was released on the 1st of January, 2009. Thus,

the promotion process under reference has taken more than a decade since the said Amended

Scheme of Promotions was issued.

I am of the view that the administrative authorities who hold power in trust to perform the

functions of the State shall not delay and/or neglect to fill the vacancies when and where such

vacancies arise. Hence, promotions in the public sector should be filled in time without undue

delays.

Referring to the need to act without delay to achieve efficiency, Leonardo da Vinci stated that:

Iron rusts from disuse, stagnant water loses its purity, and in cold weather becomes frozen;

even so does inaction sap the vigours of the mind.

It is important to keep in mind that when an individual joins the public service, he or she

entirely bases his/her life-long expectation in the public service for the betterment of his/her

life. Further, given the nature of the public service, it is common for an individual serving in

the public sector to expect certain benefits such as security in tenure, advancement in their

career and retirement benefits.

A similar view was expressed in Perera and another v. Cyril Ranatunga, Secretary Defence

and others, [1993] 1 SLR 39 at page 60, where it was held:

In effecting promotions, the State is entitled to take into consideration seniority

and merit but without violating the right to equal protection of the law. The

service of most public officers is life-time and the guarantee of fair treatment to

them enshrined in Article 12 (1) of the Constitution would, if properly enforced,

also help in maintaining a contented public service which is vital for its efficient

functioning.

Further, given the limited opportunities to obtain promotions in the public sector, the delay in

giving promotions in due time will demoralize public servants in performing their duties.

22

Thus, the stipulated procedure must be complied with and unwanted delay must be avoided at

all times to have an efficient public service. I am of the view that unreasonable and undue delay

in promoting employees is a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Other anomalies associated with the Promotions

In terms of the final marks sheet, produced marked as 1IR2, along with the Affidavit of the

1(I) respondent, three male officers, R.K.M.D. Jayasuandara Appuhamy, H. Karunasekara and

W.D.S. Kottearachchi, and a female officer, one H.M.D.W.R. Galpotta, had been promoted to

the rank of ASP after their retirement.

According to said document marked as 1IR2, the said officers had retired from service on

01.11.2007, 22.05.2007, 22.02.2007 and 31.12.2007, respectively.

Two among the said retired male officers, i.e. H. Karunasekara and W.D.S. Kottearachchi who

had retired on the 22.05.2007 and 22.02.2007 respectively, had retired from service even before

the applications for the said promotions were called for the first time on the 24th of July, 2007.

Further, a careful consideration of the abovementioned dates of retirement, i.e. 01.11.2007,

22.05.2007, 22.02.2007 and 31.12.2007, as stated in the document marked as 1IR2 shows

that the said officers have retired from service by the 20th of March, 2008 when fresh

applications for promotion to the rank of ASP were called for the second time.

Moreover, the interviews under reference had been held during the period from the 14th of

November, 2008 to the 10th of December, 2008. All the said four officers have been retired

from service before the interviews for the promotion to the rank of ASP were held. The said

male officers had been awarded 77.5, 73.5 and 73 marks, and the female officer had been

awarded 56.5 marks by the Board of Interview.

However, the respondents have not explained how the said Board of Interview interviewed and

granted marks for the said retired police officers who were not in service at the time the

interviews were held for the promotions under reference. Further, the respondents have not

given any explanation for promoting the said officers to the rank of ASP.

23

Conclusion

In the foregoing circumstances, the 1(I) respondent has failed to prove that a separate cadre

was in existence for female officers in the rank of ASP at the time the impugned promotions

were made.

The material before this court shows that the calling for applications twice for the same rank,

changing the marking scheme applicable to the promotions under reference and inordinate

delay in filling the vacancies have adversely affected the petitioners.

Further, I am of the view that the promotion of the 17th and the 18th respondents over the 1st to

3rd petitioners despite obtaining lower marks than the petitioners as stated above, is an

infringement of the petitioners Fundamental Rights enshrined in Article 12(1) of the

Constitution by the State as it has adversely affected the career advancement of the petitioners.

In the circumstances, I declare that the Fundamental Rights of the 1st to 3rd petitioners enshrined

in Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated by the state.

As stated above, it was informed to court that the 1st and 2nd petitioners were promoted to the

rank of ASP effective from the 9th of May, 2010 and that the 3rd petitioner was promoted to the

said rank effective from the 13th January, 2014.

Thus, I direct the Inspector General of Police and/or the Secretary of the National Police

Commission to backdate the promotions forthwith to the 1st of January 2008 which is the

effective date of the promotions given to the other selected candidates to the rank of ASP.

I further direct the petitioners to be placed at a suitable position on the seniority list, taking into

consideration of the facts and circumstances stated above.

Further, in light of the aforementioned findings, I am of the view that the petitioners are entitled

to have all the annual increments with effect from the 1st of January, 2008.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to forward a copy of this judgment to the Inspector

General of Police and to the Secretary of the National Police Commission to give effect to the

directions forthwith.

24

The aforesaid directions are particular to this application and should not be used as a precedent

by the other candidates who had applied for the said promotion.

There will be no costs.
