    "text": "The High Court seems to have misstated when it says in its judgment that it was an admitted fact that the first defendant was intoxicated or under the influence of liquor when he drove the car at the time of accident. Nevertheless, it is an admitted fact that the 1st defendant driver drove the vehicle after consuming intoxicating liquor at the time of the accident and it was common ground that there was a term in the insurance policy as described above as item 5 under general exceptions to disclaim any liability by the insurer. However, terms or conditions in a policy of insurance basically represent the agreement between the parties to the policy but not with the third parties who have no voice in the agreement between the insurer and the insured. Thus, the matter to be resolved is whether the insurer can deny his liability towards third parties due to the said term included as item 5 under general exceptions. In other words, can the insurer name a person as contemplated by Section 102 (4) (c) (i) in the manner described in the aforesaid term, namely item 5 under general exceptions of the policy. It appears from the judgment given by the Learned High Court Judges that they were of the view that the said term found as item 5 under the general exceptions is clear enough for the insurer to deny his liability. Thus, the conclusion of the High Court is that the policy names the 1st defendant adequately as excluded driver under aforesaid Section 102 (4) (C) (i).",

Before then, most motorists chose to insure themselves against third party risks. But there were cases of serious hardship where the person inflicting the injury was devoid of financial means and, being uninsured, was not able to pay the damages for which he was liable. It was primarily to meet these cases of hardship that the Road Traffic Act 1930 was enacted. Thus, it is clear that the rationale of introducing mandatory third -party insurance was to relieve third parties from hardships caused by motorists irrespective of the financial disabilities of the wrong doing motorists.",

The alternative source which the statute provides is one which can reasonably be expected to be in funds for the purpose, namely, an approved insurer. Accordingly the statute compulsorily provided for insurance against third party risks. It is noteworthy that Section 105 does not provide even that the liability of the insurer to pay will arise only if and when the insured person himself fails to pay the amount of the decree.

As far as the injured party is concerned, however, his right against the insurer to claim direct satisfaction of a decree entered in his favour against the insured is unaffected by the terms of the contract itself unless the insurer is protected by a declaration (under Section 137) that there has been a breach of condition in the policy which falls within one or other of the categories of excepted conditions enumerated in section 130(4). Sections 137 and 130(4) referred here are the parallel sections in the Act No.45 of 1938 to the sections 109 and 102(4) of the present Motor Traffic Act. Thus, it is clear that the rights of the third parties are statutory protected rights subject to the statutorily, allowed exclusions of liability of the insurer while rights of the parties to the policy are governed by the lawful terms of the contract between the parties.

Neither the said condition relates to a motor cycle which has no side car nor to injuries caused or contributed by conditions of war, riot or civil commotion. Hence, it is not necessary to discuss subsections 102(4)(a)(d) and (e) quoted above. As mentioned above the 3rd Defendants position is that the 1st Defendant Driver can be considered as a named person in terms of subsection 102 (4) (c) (i), the most relevant provision is subsection 102(4)(c)(i). However, subsections 102(4)(b) and 102(4)(c) relates to permitting of conditions that exclude certain person or persons or category/ genre of persons driving the vehicle which is the subject matter of the policy of insurance. When these two parts of subsection102(4) , namely 102(4) (b) and 102(4)(c), are read with the subsection 102(1), which restrict conditions that deters the liability to pay third parties, it is clear that, as far as the availability of declaration of non-liability for the insurer is concerned, the legislatures intention was to limit such exclusions or restrictions as to who drives the vehicle to the person or persons or category of persons as recognized by these two subsections. Therefore, in deciding the scope of different limbs of those two subsections it is prudent to consider both these subsections together since it may help to avoid conflicting situations.",

When a condition is permitted as per 102(4)(b)(ii), the policy contemplates only covering the liability caused by the insured or by a person employed by him. This is more likely, but may not be limited, to happen when the vehicle is intended to be used for the business or trade purposes of the insured and/or is intended to be driven by the insured or a driver employed by the insured; In other words, where the policy covers business or trade use including the personal use by the insured by himself or through an employed driver. In both these occasions the insured, persons who are permitted to drive by the insured and the employee/ employees of the insured as the case may be become authorized drivers as per the policy while all others become excluded drivers. I also observe that these two subsections, namely 102(4)(b)(i) and (ii), have a direct relation to our civil law on delictual liability in relation to accidents which is based on the Roman Dutch Law remedy, Aquilian Action. To successfully claim damages, one has to prove the wrongful act and dolus (willful or intentional act) or culpa (negligence) of the wrong doer. Thus, our system is a fault-based system and where the fault of the wrong doer is proved liability may be direct or vicarious. It is my view that these two sub sections, namely 102(4)(b)(i) and (ii) are drafted in a manner that would safeguard the third party rights when the insured is liable directly or vicariously; in other words when the insured is the wrong doer or where he is liable vicariously for the wrong doing of drivers who drive with his permission or as his employees. Subsection 102(4)(b)(i) contemplates where direct or vicarious liability might arise by the use of vehicle by the insured or close acquaintance, like family members and friends etc., since this limb of the section is, as said before, more likely concerns an insurance policy that covers the personal use of the vehicle, and subsection 102(4)(b)(ii) contemplates where direct or vicarious liability might arise by the use of vehicle by the insured or an employed driver by the insured since this limb of the section, as said before, more likely concerns an insurance policy that covers the use of the vehicle for business and trade purposes as well as certain instances of personal use.",

Navaratnam 60 NLR 520 H N G Fernando J (as he then was) seems to have expressed the opinion that separate limbs of Section 102(4)(b) is rather a description of permitted drivers than who may be excluded as drivers. It is true that while referring to exclusion of all others other than the person or persons or category of persons named there, each limb of Section 102(4)(b) indicate who are permitted drivers. He further has expressed that all three limbs in Section 102(4)(b) has to be considered as a composite description of persons who shall not be specified as excluded drivers and those three limbs should not be read disjunctively. However, I do not think that this would compel the parties to a policy to cover all the categories permitted by those three limbs, namely the insured, persons permitted by the insured and the persons employed by the insured, and named person, in each and every policy issued on the ground that they are the possible users of a vehicle. Parties are at liberty to select whom they are going to cover taking each limb separately or in combination. What may be necessary is to include all possible drivers as per the intended use of the vehicle. It is relevant to note that as per Section 100(b) even a single person can be covered by a policy. In terms of Section 99(1) it is upon the person who uses or drives or causes or permits any other to use or drive to see whether there is a third-party cover for the driver or user when the vehicle runs on the high way. If he fails, he may be faced with penal measures. Duty cast on the user or driver or one who causes or permits to use or drive cannot make the parties to the policy, including the insurer, bound to enter into an agreement to cover all the permitted drivers contemplated under all three limbs for third-party risks. If it is the insured who use or drive or causes or permits to use or drive, then it is his duty to see that driver is a permitted driver with a third -party cover. In the illustration (d) given above, the newspaper company need not get any cover for all the possible users of the vehicle. Thus, when one gets a third party cover",

Even though, with the introduction of autonomous vehicles without drivers and computerized automated machines, our system based on fault may fail, still we have to consider and interpret our law in accordance with the principles of law we follow. Thus, the subsection 102(4)(b) is drafted to safeguard third-party rights when damages are caused due to the fault of the insured or fault of other drivers for which the insured become vicariously liable or for the fault of the named person or persons as agreed by the insurer and one who takes the insurance cover. A policy of accident insurance is basically to indemnify the liabilities of the insured, and the parties to the policy also can agree to indemnify the liabilities of the named person in the policy. The insurer is paid a consideration for the cover given by the policy. If the provisions of subsection 102(4)(b) were not there, the insurer may have to pay for the fault of unauthorized drivers not concerned in the policy due to the mandatory provision for an insurance cover for third-party risks, for example, pay to the victim of an accident caused by a driver who robbed the vehicle, for whose actions neither consideration is paid for the insurer nor the insured is liable directly or vicariously.",

It is said before, that the need for an insurance covering third-party risks was made mandatory for the benefit of the public at large. In the same manner public interest requires to discourage engagement of persons without valid driving licence as drivers. On the other hand, if these provisions to exclude persons who do not have valid driving licence were not there, unskilled drivers or drivers whose competency was not tested by the authorities may be used to drive vehicles by vehicle owners, to the detriment of the public as well as insurance companies even though there may be penalties for driving without licence when they are caught by the law enforcement authorities. As I mentioned before, our system of compensating the loss caused by an accident is based on the proof of fault of the wrong doer and the compulsory insurance to cover third party risks is to guarantee the payment of damages and/or compensation that may be ordered by a decree that follows such proof, as the case may be, against the insured or his employees or drivers permitted by him or by a named person or persons in the policy. As said before the said decree may be based on direct or vicarious liability. However, what I observe is that not having a valid driving licence, though, according to the circumstances, may be supportive of proving fault based on dolus or culpa yet not decisive in proving fault, since there may be drivers who",

Only exception I can think of is that when such naming specifically identifies the person or persons to be excluded where there are many authorized drivers , since, if the insurer is allowed to name, in toto, who are considered as authorized drivers under separate limbs in Section 102(b) as persons who are not permitted to drive under Section 102(c)(i), in fact, in such occasions there will not remain any third-party cover in relation to the permitted drivers in terms of Section102(4)(b). On the other hand, if it is allowed to use wider terms without precision, insurer would be able to draft such terms to escape liability in a manner harmful to the public interest. Such nominations definitely defeat the intention of the legislature which is expressed by bringing in mandatory third-party insurance, namely priority to preserve public safety and interest. As such, I cannot think that, by Section 102(4)(c)(i), the legislature intended to allow the parties to the policy to name drivers so that the insurer can claim exclusion from liability against the public interest which the very introduction of the insurance to cover third-party risks intended to safeguard. Thus, what is allowed by the said section is naming of drivers as far as it does not conflict with the public interest which was intended to be protected by bringing in legislation to introduce mandatory insurance to cover third-party risks. Thus, the parties to the policy cannot name any person as an excluded driver without any limitation and as per their wish but they can name any person or persons as excluded drivers as far as such naming will not affect the public interest and public safety which was intended to be protected by bringing in mandatory third-party cover. Hence, as mentioned before parties may use the said section to further clarify the persons who were excluded from driving in terms of Section 102(4)(b) and it may also be used to name precisely identified person or persons, though in general they may be included in permitted drivers in terms of Section 102(4)(b) but when their exclusion is not in conflict with the public safeguard and interest which was intended to be protected by bringing in mandatory insurance cover for third-party risks. For example, if the insured, respecting his obligation to maintain uberima fides in entering in to the insurance contract, reveals that there is a person among his employees or family members whose mental condition on",

In my view, giving an insurance cover for a person who may become mentally unsound, might not ensure the public interest where the compensating the loss is based on the proof of fault on the part of the wrong doer. Thus, a validity of naming drivers under Section102(4)(c)(i) as excluded drivers against third-party risks depends on the circumstances of each case. If such naming is against the public interest which the legislature expected to protect through the introduction of mandatory third-party insurance, such naming cannot be considered as a valid one to escape from the liability.",

In fact, it does not exclude insurer or any other person from driving but it names a situation they shall not drive. Identification of the person who shall not drive is not definite at the time of entering to the policy and it is contingent on whether the said person would consume intoxicating liquor or drugs or not, prior to a point of time in future when he will drive.",

    "text": "One may argue terms excluding drunken drivers is for the interest of the public and therefore it is not in conflict with the intention of the legislature shown by bringing in insurance to cover third-party risks. A cursory glance may give such an impression but when one looks deep into the issue it is not so. In this aspect one has to examine what was intended by the legislature to be remedied by introducing third-party insurance. It is clear due to what is mentioned before that the insurer has to satisfy a decree against the persons covered by the policy when it is given in favour of a third party unless the insurer is entitled to get a declaration of non-liability as per the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act. This liability to satisfy the decree is there irrespective of the financial capability or incapability of the people whose liability is insured by the policy. Thus, what was intended was to cover the liability of the persons who are insured or covered by the policy. As indicated above under our law liability arises with the proof of fault of the wrong doer. Hence, what was intended to remedy by the third-party insurance cover is the harm caused by the fault. Proof of Drunkenness or acts of negligence and recklessness are decisive in proof of fault of the wrong doer. If in the guise of naming drivers, it is allowed to claim non-liability on such wrongs, the object of bringing in mandatory insurance to cover third-party risks would fail, since it makes the wrong doers, whose fault was to be remedied by third -party cover, excluded drivers. Thus, such naming is contrary to the public interest, which the legislature intended to safeguard by providing mandatory third-party insurance. Thus, I am not inclined to think that the legislature intended to allow naming of drivers under Section 102(4)(c)(i) in a manner to defeat the public interest as found in the said impugned item 5 of the policy; In other words, such naming allows to remove the fault which was to be remedied, from the remedy provided by introducing mandatory third-party cover making the remedy redundant.",
