The Plaintiff states that he accordingly visited the house of the Defendant that evening in the expectation of being paid the profits of the said business for the year 1991/92. The Plaintiff admits that (a) he met the Defendant over a cup of tea and that he was handed over a cheque post-dated to 2nd November 1992 in a sum of Rs. 134,644 [P7], and (b) he signed a receipt acknowledging payment and a few other documents. However, unlike on previous occasions, the Plaintiff claims that he was not given a copy either of the receipt or of the other documents signed by him. Upon returning home, the Plaintiff had handed over the said cheque to his son-in-law, Ranjith Hettiarachchi with instructions to deposit the said cheque on the due date. Having seen the value of the cheque and realising that the sum paid as \u2018profits\u2019 was unusually high compared with previous years, Hettiarachchi had asked the Plaintiff for a breakdown of the said sum. The Plaintiff claims that he declared at that point that he was not given a breakdown, and had accordingly instructed Hettiarachchi to obtain it from Danatunga. On 18th October 1992, Hettiarachchi claims that he had visited the house of Danatunga and requested for a breakdown of the said sum of Rs. 134,644. Danatunga is said to have handed over to Hettiarachchi on the 19th, a document written by Danatunga marked P8 on which the following breakdown of the aforesaid sum of Rs. 134,644 had been written: Share of the Plaintiff Rs. 75000 Arrears Rs. 21602 Profits for 1991-92 Rs. 18042 Refund of money obtained for the curtain Rs. 20000 Although in terms of P8, the Plaintiff\u2019s share of Rs. 75,000 had been returned to the Plaintiff, it is the position of the Plaintiff that he never agreed to sell his share in Elite Cinema to the Defendant.

The second is that several documents including the receipt were signed by the Plaintiff, and that the Plaintiff read these documents prior to signing. The third was that the Plaintiff accepted the cheque with the full understanding of what he was doing. The fourth and perhaps the most important was the denial of the allegation of misrepresentation and cheating. P20 has not been replied by the Plaintiff.

Paragraph 10 of the answer referred to the fact that the Plaintiff had given up his rights as a partner by virtue of having signed a receipt to that effect. Thus, the issue raised by the Defendant was whether the Plaintiff could maintain the action having transferred his share. The Plaintiff\u2019s case commenced with the evidence of his son-in-law, followed by Don Herbert Nihal [a nephew of the Plaintiff who was an employee of the Defendant], Danatunga, the Plaintiff and finally an employee of the accountancy firm that audited the accounts of the partnership. The Defendant did not give evidence nor did he lead the evidence of any other person. However, three documents [V1 \u2013 V3] were marked by the Defendant during cross examination. Of these three documents, V1 is the receipt that was admitted at the trial to have been signed by the Plaintiff on 17th October 1992. By its judgment delivered on 22nd August 2003, the District Court accepted the position of the Plaintiff that when he signed V1 and accepted P7, his intention was only to accept the profits for that particular year and that the Defendant had failed to contradict the position of the Plaintiff. The District Court accordingly held with the Plaintiff and granted the aforementioned relief. Aggrieved, the Defendant had appealed to the High Court which had upheld the judgment of the District Court by its judgment delivered on 1st March 2013. P7 being the cheque that was issued was not deposited by the Plaintiff. As a result, the monies have remained with the Defendant since October 1992. If a decision is reached in favour of the Defendant, that would not only mean that the Plaintiff is not entitled to any share in the partnership but would also result in the Defendant not making any payment for the share of the Plaintiff. In order to avoid the Defendant being unjustly enriched in such an eventuality, the Plaintiff shall be entitled to the said sum of Rs. 134,644.",

This brings me to the second part of this judgment. The plea of non est factum In order to answer the second and third questions of law, I shall at the outset consider what is meant by non est factum, whether a plea of non est factum is vitiated by the negligence or carelessness of the person relying on the said plea and the evidentiary burden that must be satisfied in order to succeed with the plea. Non est factum is a defence available to someone who has been misled into signing a document which is fundamentally different from what he or she intended to execute or sign. Accordingly, where the defence is established, the signing party may be able to escape the effect of the signature by arguing that the agreement was void for mistake.",

    "text": "\u201cThe doctrine of mistake in the law of contract deals with two rather different situations. In the first, the parties are agreed on the terms of the contract but have entered it under a shared and fundamental misapprehension as to the facts or the law. Cases in this category are now usually referred to as \u201ccommon\u201d mistake, for normally the mistake is legally relevant only if both parties have contracted under the same misapprehension. In the second, there is some mistake or misunderstanding in the communications between the parties which prevents there being an effective agreement [for instance if the parties misunderstand each other] or at least means that there is no agreement on the terms apparently stated. This second category of mistake includes \u2026 \u2018unilateral mistake\u2019, where only one of the parties is mistaken, over the terms of the contract \u2026 . \u201d [paragraph 5-001] \u201cThere is, however, a third type of mistake which might be seen as a variant of unilateral mistake, but which for convenience will be placed in a separate category. It is peculiar to the law of written contracts, and it allows a party who has executed a document under a fundamental misapprehension as to its nature to plead that it is \u201cnot his deed\u201d. This is the defence of non est factum.\u201d [paragraphs 5-002] \u201cThe general rule is that a person is estopped by his or her deed, and although there is no such estoppel in the case of ordinary signed documents, a party of full age and understanding is normally bound by his signature to a document, whether he reads or understands it or not. If, however, a party has been misled into executing a deed or signing a document essentially different from that which he intended to execute or sign he can plead non est factum in an action against him. The deed or writing is completely void in whosesoever hands it may come. In most of the cases in which non est factum has been successfully pleaded the mistake has been induced by fraud.\u201d [paragraph 5-102] [emphasis added] The limited extent to which Court will accept the defence of non est factum was considered in Muskham Finance Ltd v Howard and another [(1963) 1 Q.B. 904; at page 912] where Donovan L.J held that \u201cThe plea of non est factum is a plea which must necessarily be kept within narrow limits.

In that case, the 1st defendant, Lee had placed before the plaintiff a deed for her to sign. The plaintiff had broken her spectacles and could not read effectively without them. She asked what the deed was, and Lee said, in the presence of the nephew of the plaintiff and without any dissent from him, that the deed was to do with the gift to the nephew of the house of the plaintiff. The plaintiff, not having asked her nephew to read the deed to her or give his explanation of it, but assuming that her nephew and Lee knew what they were doing, and desiring to help her nephew in the way that he wished, signed the deed.

But at least since the sixteenth century it has also been held to apply in certain cases so as to enable a person who in fact signed a document to say that it is not his deed. Obviously any such extension must be kept within narrow limits if it is not to shake the confidence of those who habitually and rightly rely on signatures when there is no obvious reason to doubt their validity. Originally this extension appears to have been made in favour of those who were unable to read owing to blindness or illiteracy and who therefore had to trust someone to tell them what they were signing. I think it must also apply in favour of those who are permanently or temporarily unable through no fault of their own to have without explanation any real understanding of the purport of a particular document, whether that be from defective education, illness or innate incapacity. But that does not excuse them from taking such precautions as they reasonably can. \u2026 So there must be a heavy burden of proof on the person who seeks to invoke this remedy. He must prove all the circumstances necessary to justify its being granted to him, and that necessarily involves his proving that he took all reasonable precautions in the circumstances.

But that could only be in very exceptional circumstances: certainly not where his reason for not scrutinising the document before signing it was that he was too busy or too lazy. In general I do not think he can be heard to say that he signed in reliance on someone he trusted. But, particularly when he was led to believe that the document which he signed was not one which affected his legal rights, there may be cases where this plea can properly be applied in favour of a man of full capacity. The plea cannot be available to anyone who was content to sign without taking the trouble to try to find out at least the general effect of the document. Many people do frequently sign documents put before them for signature by their solicitor or other trusted advisers without making any enquiry as to their purpose or effect. But the essence of the plea non est factum is that the person signing believed that the document he signed had one character or one effect whereas in fact its character or effect was quite different. He could not have such a belief unless he had taken steps or been given information which gave him some grounds for his belief. The amount of information he must have and the sufficiency of the particularity of his belief must depend on the circumstances of each case. We find in many of the authorities statements that a man's deed is not his deed if his mind does not go with his pen. But that is far too wide. It would cover cases where the man had taken no precautions at all, and there was no ground for his belief that he was signing something different from that which in fact he signed. I think that it is the wrong approach to start from that wide statement and then whittle it down by excluding cases where the remedy will not be granted. It is for the person who seeks the remedy to show that he should have it.\u201d In a separate opinion, Lord Pearson stated as follows [page 1034]:",

However, the aggregate of the two amounted to only Rs. 37,459.32 which was less than 30% of what the Plaintiff was now being given by way of P7. Yet, the Plaintiff did not question the Defendant. 7) The Plaintiff was given a cheque and not cash. Furthermore, the cheque was post-dated by 15 days. To my mind, this evidence is critical for the reason that handing over of a post-dated cheque does not demonstrate the conduct of a person who is trying to mislead or deceive another person to do something which he otherwise would not have done. There is no evidence to suggest that the Plaintiff who was or had been engaged in money lending was illiterate or did not apprehend the nature of V1 or that the Defendant in any way misrepresented facts to the Plaintiff or made an erroneous explanation, nor is there any evidence that any other person misrepresented the contents of V1 to the Plaintiff in any way. There were several signals that ought to have triggered alarm bells in the mind of the Plaintiff including the value of P7 and the number of documents that the Plaintiff was asked to sign, and of course the fact that the Plaintiff read V1. The Plaintiff ignored these warning signals and even if his version is accepted, it is clear that the Plaintiff has not acted with prudence. The Plaintiff has therefore only himself to blame. The Plaintiff\u2019s evidence taken at its best cannot support a conclusion that the Plaintiff (a) did not sufficiently understand what he was doing, and (b) was under a fundamental misapprehension with regard to the nature of V1. This is aggravated by the failure of the Plaintiff to explain the manner in which he was misled, either by word, act or conduct, by the Defendant, to sign V1 and to accept P7. The nail on the coffin so to say is the failure on the part of the Plaintiff to act prudently. If the Plaintiff had no intention to sell his share, and with V1 being clear, to yet have signed V1 and accept P7 was negligent conduct on the part of the Plaintiff. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the Plaintiff cannot claim that he did not have the intention to transfer his share in the partnership to the Defendant.",

Danatunga admitted in his evidence-in-chief that, (a) he wrote the cheque P7 drawn on an account of Elite Motor Works owned by the Defendant, (b) on previous occasions, the value of the dividend was much less than P7, (c) on those previous occasions, a receipt was issued setting out the details of the payment that was being made, and (d) the receipt V1 [marked through Danatunga] was signed by the Plaintiff in his presence. The next issue was whether V1 had been issued to the Plaintiff and if so, when.

    "text": "Judgment of the District Court \u2013 revisited I shall now consider the judgments of the two Courts in the final part of this judgment. I must, in fairness to both the District Court and the High Court state that even though Issue No. 1 had an element of the defence of mistake in it, the plea of non est factum was not raised directly before both Courts and came to the forefront only at the point that leave to appeal was granted on the second and third questions of law. Be that as it may, except in very limited circumstances, the law does not permit a person who places his signature on a document to later claim that he did not intend to sign such document and therefore is not bound by such document. In that background, it should have been clear to both Courts that the basis for Issue No. 1 was the defence of mistake. It was therefore the task of the District Court to consider very carefully (a) the circumstances relating to all three factual components and in particular the first component, and (b) the evidence of the Plaintiff and Danatunga who had been involved during each factual component of the case. Once an appeal was lodged, it became the task of the High Court to consider if the District Court has fulfilled its task and consider the judgment of the District Court in the light of the evidence led before the District Court. The High Court has failed to do so, and has instead not only relied almost entirely on the findings of the District Court but also proceeded beyond its mandate and come to a finding that the Defendant had cheated the Plaintiff when such an issue was neither raised before the District Court nor borne out by the evidence. This error on the part of the High Court resulted in this Court granting leave on the first question of law. Due to the aforementioned failure on the part of the High Court, I shall first consider the findings of the District Court and thereafter the findings of the High Court. Having examined the judgment of the District Court, I observe that even though the District Court has considered the events that occurred on 17th October 1992, its decision on the Plaintiff\u2019s assertion that he did not have the intention to transfer his share has been influenced by what transpired after the 17th, namely that the Plaintiff acted expeditiously soon after the 17th, the issuance of P8, that the letter of demand was sent four days later and that action was filed soon thereafter.",

    "text": "Quite apart from the failure of the District Court to consider the entirety of the evidence of the Plaintiff with regard to what transpired on 17th October 1992, there are four matters on which the District Court erred which goes to the root of its judgment. The first relates to the Plaintiff having read V1 prior to signing it. Even though it re-produced in its judgment the evidence of the Plaintiff where he admitted having read V1, the District Court disregarded that evidence on the basis that the Plaintiff was old and did not know what he was doing. While the age of the Plaintiff is admitted, the evidence of the Plaintiff does not support a finding that the Plaintiff did not have sufficient understanding as to what he was doing when he read and signed V1 in 1992. The law is very clear on this point. A person who has read the impugned document cannot later claim that his mind did not align with his hand. Commerce cannot work if a person is allowed to resile from his acts so easily. The second matter on which the District Court erred was when it failed to consider the evidence of Danatunga who was involved in all three factual components of this case, especially his evidence that (a) the Plaintiff discussed the sale of his share prior to 17th October 1992, and (b) a copy of V1 was handed over to the Plaintiff together with P7 at the residence of the Defendant on the 17th itself. This evidence was critical as it contradicts the Plaintiff\u2019s version on all three factual components of this case. The third error is that the District Court relied on the evidence of the son-in-law of the Plaintiff and P8 in spite of (a) the evidence of Danatunga that the Plaintiff was aware of the breakdown since a copy of V1 was issued to the Plaintiff at the time he left the residence of the Defendant on the 17th, and (b) Danatunga not having been questioned on the circumstances that led to the issuance of P8. The Plaintiff also stated that had he wanted to transfer his share, he would have gone before an Attorney-at-Law. Quite apart from the fact that the transfer of his wife\u2019s share to him was not carried out before an Attorney-at-Law, the fact remains that the period of the Agreement had come to an end, even though the Plaintiff and the Defendant continued their partnership to operate the cinema. The District Court was however influenced by this evidence of the Plaintiff. This is the fourth error committed by the District Court.",

    "text": "Judgment of the High Court \u2013 revisited I must reiterate that the High Court erred when it failed to consider if the findings of the District Court are supported by the evidence and instead blindly followed the judgment of the District Court. In the course of its judgment, the High Court arrived at the following erroneous findings: (a) The breakdown of the money which was usually given to the Plaintiff was not given; (b) The documents were signed by the Plaintiff without reading them; (c) The documents signed by the Plaintiff had been prepared fraudulently and he was deceived by the Defendant. This is a grave error. Quite apart from the fact that no issue had been raised with regard to fraud or deception, the Plaintiff did not explain in his evidence as to the manner in which he was deceived. Furthermore, V1 had been prepared by Danatunga but no suggestion was made to him in this regard. Thus, there was no basis at all for the High Court to conclude that the Plaintiff had been deceived by the Defendant;",

    "text": "There is one other matter that I must address prior to concluding. I stated at the outset that the sum of Rs. 134,644 has remained with the Defendant since October 1992 for the reason that P7 was never deposited by the Plaintiff. To allow the appeal without affording the Plaintiff any remedy would amount to the Defendant having the share of the Plaintiff at no cost. That would amount to an unjust enrichment on the part of the Defendant. I am accordingly of the view that the Substituted Plaintiff shall be entitled to the said sum of Rs. 134,644. Conclusion In the above circumstances, I answer the three questions of law in the affirmative. The judgment of the District Court and the High Court are set aside, this appeal is allowed, and the action of the Plaintiff shall stand dismissed, subject to the direction that the Substituted Defendants shall pay the Substituted Plaintiff a sum of Rs. 134,644.",
