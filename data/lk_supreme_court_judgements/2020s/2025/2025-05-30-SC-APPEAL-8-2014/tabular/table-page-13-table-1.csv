"ord Reid, with whom the other four Law Lords agreed, stated that [pages 1015 – 1016]:"
"“The plea  of non est  factum obviously applies  when  the person  sought to be  held"
"liable did not in fact sign the document. But at least since the sixteenth century it has"
"also been held to apply in certain cases so as to enable a person who in fact signed"
"a document to say that it is not his deed. Obviously any such extension must be kept"
"within narrow limits if it is not to shake the confidence of those who habitually and"
"rightly rely on signatures when there is no obvious reason to doubt their validity."
"Originally this extension appears to have been made in favour of those who were"
"unable  to  read  owing  to  blindness  or  illiteracy  and  who  therefore  had  to  trust"
"someone to tell them what they were signing. I think it must also apply in favour of"
"those who are permanently or temporarily unable through no fault of their own to"
"have  without  explanation  any  real  understanding  of  the  purport  of  a  particular"
"document, whether that be from defective education, illness or innate incapacity."
