"District Court are supported by the evidence and instead blindly followed the judgment",""
"of the District Court. In the course of its judgment, the High Court arrived at the following",""
"erroneous findings:",""
"(
a)","The breakdown of the money which was usually given to the Plaintiff was not given;"
"(
b)","The documents were signed by the Plaintiff without reading them;"
"(
c)","The documents signed by the Plaintiff had been prepared fraudulently and he was"
"","deceived by the Defendant. This is a grave error. Quite apart from the fact that no"
"","issue had been raised with regard to fraud or deception, the Plaintiff did not explain"
"","in his evidence as to the manner in which he was deceived. Furthermore, V1 had"
"","been  prepared  by  Danatunga  but  no  suggestion  was  made  to  him  in  this  regard."
"","Thus, there was no basis at all for the High Court to conclude that the Plaintiff had"
"","been deceived by the Defendant;"
"(d)","Danatunga  has  admitted  that  the  Plaintiff  signed  V1  without  knowing  the  exact"
"","contents of V1;"
"(
e)","The evidence of the witnesses of the Plaintiff has corroborated the Plaintiffâ€™s version"
"","that he was not aware of the contents of V1 when he signed it, whereas the evidence"
"","of Danatunga was to the contrary."
