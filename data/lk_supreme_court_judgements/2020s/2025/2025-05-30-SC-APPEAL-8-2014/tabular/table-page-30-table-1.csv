"I
 shall now consider the judgments of the two Courts in the final part of this judgment."
"I
 must, in fairness to both the District Court and the High Court state that even though"
"Issue No. 1 had an element of the defence of mistake in it, the plea of non est factum was"
"not raised directly before both Courts and came to the forefront only at the point that"
"leave to appeal was granted on the second and third questions of law. Be that as it may,"
"except in very  limited circumstances, the law does not permit a person who places his"
"signature on a document to later claim that he did not intend to sign such document and"
"therefore is not bound by such document. In that background, it should have been clear"
"to both Courts that the basis for Issue No. 1 was the defence of mistake."
