"Quite apart from the failure of the District Court to consider the entirety of the evidence"
"of  the  Plaintiff  with  regard  to  what  transpired  on  17th  October  1992,  there  are  four"
"matters on which the District Court erred which goes to the root of its judgment."
"T
he  first  relates  to  the  Plaintiff  having  read  V1  prior  to  signing  it.  Even  though  it  re-"
"produced in its judgment the evidence of the Plaintiff where he admitted having read V1,"
"the District Court disregarded that evidence on the basis that the Plaintiff was old and did"
"not know what he was doing. While the age of the Plaintiff is admitted, the evidence of"
"the  Plaintiff  does  not  support  a 
finding 
that  the  Plaintiff  did  not  have  sufficient"
"understanding as to what he was doing when he read and signed V1 in 1992. The law is"
"very clear on  this  point. A person  who  has read the impugned  document  cannot  later"
"claim  that  his  mind  did  not  align  with  his  hand.  Commerce  cannot  work  if  a  person  is"
"allowed to resile from his acts so easily."
"T
he second matter on which the District Court erred was when it failed to consider the"
"evidence of  Danatunga who  was involved in all three factual components  of this case,"
"especially his evidence that (a) the Plaintiff discussed the sale of his share prior to 17th"
"October 1992, and (b) a copy of V1 was handed over to the Plaintiff together with P7 at"
"the  residence  of  the  Defendant  on  the  17th 
itself.  This  evidence  was  critical  as 
it"
"contradicts the Plaintiff’s version on all three factual components of this case."
"T
he third error is that the District Court relied on the evidence of the son-in-law of the"
"Plaintiff and P8 in spite of (a) the evidence of Danatunga that the Plaintiff was aware of"
"the  breakdown  since  a  copy  of  V1  was  issued  to  the  Plaintiff  at  the  time  he  left  the"
"residence of the Defendant on the 17th, and (b) Danatunga not having been questioned"
"on the circumstances that led to the issuance of P8."
"T
he Plaintiff also stated that had he wanted to transfer his share, he would have gone"
"before an Attorney-at-Law. Quite apart from the fact that the transfer of his wife’s share"
"to him was not carried out before an Attorney-at-Law, the fact remains that the period of"
"the  Agreement  had  come  to  an  end,  even  though  the  Plaintiff  and  the  Defendant"
"continued  their  partnership  to  operate  the  cinema.  The  District  Court  was  however"
"influenced  by  this  evidence  of  the  Plaintiff.  This  is  the  fourth  error  committed  by  the"
"District Court."
