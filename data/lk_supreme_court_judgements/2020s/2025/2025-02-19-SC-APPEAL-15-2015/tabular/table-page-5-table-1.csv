"using such descriptions – vide the Schedule to the Answer and land registry folios marked V3"
"and V3a and deeds marked V4, V5 and V7 etc."
"I
ssues were raised on 07.02.1997 and the wife of the Plaintiff, Dayawathie (the Respondent),"
"Mr. D.M. Gamage, L.S. and an officer from the Agrarian Services office had given evidence"
"for the Plaintiff’s case while the Appellant (Defendant), aforesaid D.M. Gamage, L.S. and an"
"officer from the National Gem and Jewelry Authority had given evidence for the Appellant at"
"the said trial. Officers from the Agrarian Services Office and the National Gem Authority were"
"not  called  to  establish  the  identity  of  the  Corpus  but  only  with  regard  to  some  acreage  tax"
"receipts and issuance of gem mining license and related matters."
"D
. M. Gamage, L.S. had been called to give evidence by both Parties, namely the Plaintiff as"
"well as the Appellant. Plan No.533 was prepared by him on the commission issued to him at"
"the request of the Plaintiff. The aforesaid Plan and report had been marked as X and X1 at the"
"trial. As per the Plaintiff’s position, the land he claims, namely “Ihala Yatipil Owita” consists"
"of  Lot A  and  B  of  that  Plan.  However,  there  is  no  ditch  found  at  the  boundary  to  the West"
"separating a land named “Aramba Watta” in that Plan. Aramba Watta shown on the Southern"
"part of the boundary on the West is separated by a line of trees (ගස් වැටිය). The surveyor in his"
"report at the latter part of item 11 had stated that there appears to be signs of a ditch that existed"
"in the past on the South and West boundaries which have become obliterated due to the lapse"
"of time and gem mining. However, the only ditch that is visible is the one found in the middle"
"of the land shown by the Plaintiff separating Lot A and B, which is indicated by a dotted line."
"This  dotted  line  is  the  boundary,  as  per  the  position  of  the Appellant,  that  separates  “Ihala"
"Yatipil  Owita”  the  land  claimed  by  the  Plaintiff  and  “Aramba”,  the  land  claimed  by  the"
"Appellant  as  a  co-owner.  Above  statement  made  by  the  surveyor  in  his  report  has  to  be"
"considered  in  light  of  the  statement  he  had  made  under  item  10  of  his  report  where  he  has"
"clearly stated that he cannot opine whether the Lot A and B form the Corpus of “Ihala Yatipil"
"Owita” or not. This clearly shows that the surveyor was not satisfied as to the identification of"
"“Ihala Yatipil Owita” by the Plaintiff. On the other hand, if Lot A is considered as part of “Ihala"
"Yatipil Owita”, Ela separating Arambagawa Kumbura (Arambagawa paddy field) becomes part"
"of  the  boundary  to  the  West,  North West  and  North  of  the  said  land,  when  nowhere  in  the"
"Schedule to the Plaint or in any document such description is given to describe the boundaries"
"of the said “Ihala Yatipil Owita”. It is true that the extent of said “Ihala Yatipil Owita” had been"
"described as ‘about 3 Acres’ in the Schedule and other deeds. Lots A and B both together is less"
"than 3 Acres. Hence, one may be able to argue that Lot B has to be a part of the Plaintiff’s land"
"but  the  extent  of Aramba  has  been  described  as  2 Acres  in  the  relevant  documents.  If  it  is"
"considered that Lot A in said Plan is not part of “Aramba”, Aramba which has to be on the West"
"to “Ihala Yatipil Owita” has to be limited to Lot 2 in Plan No. 548 (marked V1 at the trial),"
"which is less than ½ an Acre. Lot 2 and Lot 1අ (which is almost similar to aforesaid Lot A in"
"Plan No.533) taken together will not make it 2 Acres. Thus, extents referred to in old deeds and"
"documents without reference to a Plan cannot be considered as decisive in identifying the lands."
"T
he  Substituted  Plaintiff,  Dayawathie  (the  Respondent),  who  gave  evidence  to  support  the"
"position of the Plaintiff appeared to have not said that the Plaintiff or his predecessors in title"
"had engaged in gem mining in the past. Further, as per the evidence of the said Respondent,"
"she came to know the aforesaid land only after her marriage that took place 32 years prior to"
"the date of giving evidence, thus from 1970. Thus, her knowledge regarding the boundaries"
"may have been gained mainly through what others have said to her and not by observing the"
"way it was possessed prior to that. Hence, her evidence does not explain the existence of old"
