Wetiya may mean a ridge/ line of trees or stones)"

he learned District Judge had correctly observed that the documents marked by the Appellant"
"also do not describe the said boundaries with uniformity. However, it must be noted that in"
"some of the documents marked by the Appellant, boundary to the North is also described as"
"Gonagal Ela, sometimes in addition to the ‘Paddy Field’. The said paddy field is sometimes"
"described as ‘Paddy Field separating Aramba’. The land Yatipil Owita mentioned above as the"
"boundary to the East is sometimes described as ‘Ihala Yatipil Owita’. In some documents, the"
"said boundary to the East has been described as Gonagal Ela. Instead of Paranawatta which is"
"to the West as described above, boundary to the West has been described as Lokgamage Watta-"
"vide deeds marked V4, V5, V6, V7, land registry folios marked as V3 and V3a etc. It is to be"
"noted that some of the deeds marked by the Defendant describe the boundary to the East as"
"“Ihala Yatipil Owita” or the ditch separating “Ihala Yatipil Owita” which corresponds to the"
"description of the boundary to the West by the Plaintiff for the land he claimed as Ihala Yatipil"
"Owita. Thus, on balance of probability, there should have been a ditch separating “Aramba”"
"and “Ihala Yatipil Owita”. It appears that in some of the documents of the Appellant, this ditch"
"has been described as Gonagal Ela.  However, in comprehending the boundaries, it must be"
"noted that generally an Ela means a man-made water way while Oya means a natural water"
"way."
"A
s per the brief, it is clear that there is no dispute between the Parties that Lot B in Plan No.533"
"or Lot 1ආ in Plan No.548 belongs to the land claimed by the Plaintiff which is “Ihala Yatipil"
"Owita”. The cause of action of the Plaintiff and claim of the Defendant (Appellant) centered"
"on the fact whether the Lot A in Plan No.533 or the Lot 1අ in Plan No.548 belongs to the land"
"claimed by the Plaintiff or to the land claimed by the Appellant. Success of the Plaintiff’s case"
"was dependent on the fact whether the Plaintiff was successful in proving that said Lot A or 1අ"
"in  respective  plans  was  part  of  “Ihala Yatipil  Owita”  while  the  success  of  the Appellant’s"
"counter claim was dependent on proving that the said Lot was part of “Aramba”. As per the"
"reports made to the above plans, gem mining had been taken place in said Lot A or 1අ in the"
"respective plans. The Plan No.533 was made in 1991 which is close to the date of the cause of"
"action described in the Plaint, namely 1991, March. Anyhow, the report of the said Plan marked"
"X1 states that there are several old gem pits other than the new one."
"I
t must be noted that, as per the description of boundaries in both lands, namely “Ihala Yatipil"
"Owita” and “Aramba”, the boundary to the west in “Ihala Yatipil Owita” is the ditch separating"
"“Aramba” and the boundary to the East in “Aramba” is the Ditch separating “Yatipil Owita” or"
"“Ihala Yatipil Owita”. Thus, by identifying the place where the said ditch situates is the best"
"way to decide whether the Appellant (Defendant) had encroached the rights of the Plaintiff or"
"not.  Furthermore, it is observed that no paddy field or Ela is described as the boundary to the"
"North of the land claimed by the Plaintiff, namely “Ihala Yatipil Owita” where boundary to the"
"North  of  “Aramba”  for  which  the Appellant  had  claimed  co-ownership  had  been  described"
