"","fter  the  trial,  the  Learned Additional  District  Court  Judge  delivered  the  Judgement,  dated"
"25.07.2006,  in  favour  of  the Appellant. The  learned  District  Judge  in  his  Judgment,  among",""
"other things, had stated as follows:",""
"•","That  boundary  description  in  the  documents  tendered  by  both  parties  relating  to  the"
"","lands they claimed do not have uniformity in describing the boundaries."
"•","However, it is common ground that lands named “Ihala Yatipil Owita” and “Aramba”"
"","are separated by a ditch."
"•","Even though, the deeds refer to the extent of the Plaintiff’s land as a land of about 3"
"","acres, they do not indicate the exact extent of the Plaintiff’s land."
"•","Even though the Plaintiff stated that the tomb in Lot A in Plan marked X is the tomb of"
"","his father’s 3rd wife, it cannot refute the evidence of the Appellant which says that it is"
"","the tomb of his Maternal Aunt (ල ොකු අම්මො)."
"•","The root cause for the dispute is the gem mining by the Appellant and nowhere it is said"
"","that the Plaintiff engaged in gem mining. Thus, the mines reported in X1 report should"
"","be the mines of the Appellant."
"•","The western boundary of Deed marked P5 is the ditch separating Aramba (අරඹ ගවේ"
"","වන අගල)."
"•","The  Plaintiff  in  his  original  Plaint  dated  04.03.1991  has  referred  to  the  western"
"","boundary as the ditch separating Aramba (අරඹ ගවේ වන අගලද) and by amended Plaint"
"","dated 25.07.1994 had taken a substantially different position as to the western boundary"
"","as the ditch separating Arambawata (අරඹවත්ත ගවේ වන අගලද). (However, it must be"
"","noted here that this amended Plaint has not been accepted by the District Court)"
"•","The surveyor clearly says that there is a ditch and line of trees shown in Plan marked"
"","Y
, which is shown as a dotted line in Plan marked X which can be considered as definite"
"","boundary. Even though the Plaintiff took up the position that it was a ditch made to"
"","protect the land from soil erosions, it cannot be accepted as, other than the ditch, there"
"","is line of trees with barbed wire fence."
"•","Thus, the Plaintiff is not entitled to the whole land he showed as “Ihala Yatipil Owita”,"
"","but only to Lot B in Plan marked X. The Defendant is entitled to Lots 1ආ and 2 in the"
"","Plan marked Y as the land he claimed as “Aramba”. (This Court observes that, as per"
"","the reasons given, there is a typographical error here. It should be corrected as Lots 1අ"
"","and 2 in Plan marked Y. And as per his stance this entitlement is claimed as a Co-owner"
"","to that land and not as the sole owner.)."
