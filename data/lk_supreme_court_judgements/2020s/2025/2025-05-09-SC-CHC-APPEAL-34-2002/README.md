Obeyesekere, J The dispute that I am called upon to adjudicate in this appeal has arisen between two pares who, at the start of their business relaonship and when mes were good between them, agreed to set up a private company and invest their hard earned money in such company, allocate shares among themselves and carry on business together but where, either due to the greed or otherwise of one or more of the pares, the relaonship turned sour over a period of me, resulng in acon being led alleging that the rights of one person as a shareholder have been oppressed by the other. I must state that this is not an uncommon phenomenon in private companies and leaves the aected shareholder/s concerned in a precarious posion, as he or she is locked in and nds it dicult or almost impossible to realise his or her investment. Evoluon of the provisions relang to oppression It is perhaps for this reason that legislaon relang to companies contain provisions to deal with the oppression of shareholders and mismanagement of the aairs of companies. An extremely useful discussion of the historical evoluon of the legislave provisions relang to oppression and mismanagement are found in Company Law by Kanaganayagam Kanag-Isvaran and Dilshani Wijayawardana [2014]. While I shall not quote chapter and verse, the following discussion is based thereon. The statutory remedy available in the United Kingdom at the turn of the 20th century for oppressive conduct, whether or not it involved a parcular wrongful act, was to wind up the company. However, concerns that winding up of the company may not be the best soluon especially where such company is solvent saw the introducon of Secon 210 of the Companies Act of 1948 in the United Kingdom, which provided an alternave to winding up. Ceylon, as we were then known, followed suit by the introducon of Secons 153A and 153B to the Companies Ordinance of 1938 through the Companies (Amendment) Act, No. 15 of 1964. These provisions provided inter alia for the prevenon of oppression and mismanagement as an alternave to winding up. Largely based on the Indian Companies Act, 1956, the new provisions provided a boon to minority shareholders for it enabled them to maintain checks and balances on the abuse of power by majority shareholders,

6

with a right to bring an acon against them with a view to remedying same. [Company Law; supra; page 511]. The Ordinance of 1938 was repealed by the Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982, and the provisions of the laer relang to oppression and mismanagement are found in Secons 210 and 211. These secons were not framed as an alternave to winding up, as in 1964, but instead:

gave Court general powers to act when an applicaon was made that the aairs of the company were being conducted in a manner oppressive to any member or members, or where the aairs of the company were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company, or that a material change had taken place and that by reason of such change it was likely that the aairs of the company may have been conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the company.; addressed the problem of the rights of a shareholder being denied or disregarded or overridden by the majority shareholders, hence the term oppression, and the empowerment of the court to remedy the maers complained of by appropriate orders, so that the oppression complained of was removed and the rights of the shareholder restored or upheld. [Company Law; supra; page 513]. While I shall be considering in this appeal Secons 210 and 211 of the Companies Act of 1982, I must state that the provisions of the Act of 1982 have been replaced by Secons 224-232 of the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007. The provisions in the Act of 2007 are substanally based on the provisions of the Act of 1982. What is oppression? In responding to the queson as to what is oppression, Samayawardhena, J has stated in Dehigaspe Patabendige Nishantha v Ceylon MKN Eco Power (Pvt) Limited and others [SC Appeal No. SC/CHC/Appeal No. 26/2003; SC minutes of 28th February 2024 ] that:

Due to the innite variability of circumstances in which oppression may arise, it is inherently intricate to provide a precise legal denion to the term oppression. The determinaon of whether oppression exists necessitates a case-by-case evaluaon of the unique facts and circumstances. In the House of Lords case of Scosh Co-

7

operave Wholesale Society Limited v. Meyer [1958] 3 All ER 66 at 71, Lord Simonds described the meaning of the term oppression in this context as the majority exercising authority over the minority in a manner that is burdensome, harsh and wrongful. In Company Law [supra; page 518], the authors have stated that:

When a shareholder complains of oppression on the part of the company, he must show that he has been constrained to submit to a conduct, which lacks probity, is unfair to him and which causes prejudice to his legal and proprietary rights as a shareholder. The acts complained of must deny to the complaining shareholder or shareholders their rights, or their legimate expectaons as shareholders. The rights and legimate expectaons of shareholders must be those rights and expectaons the company can and should honour on a legal basis, and the shareholders can demand as of right, and not every wish and fancy of a shareholder. [emphasis added] This posion was emphasised in Dehigaspe Patabendige Nishantha v Ceylon MKN Eco Power (Pvt) Limited and others [supra] where Samayawardhena, J. stated as follows:

However, a shareholder who seeks relief against oppression can only claim what he is legally entled to and not what his whims and fancies demand. But I must add that legal rights are not limited to strict legal rights embodied only in the arcles of associaon of the company. It may encompass legal rights grounded in broader equitable consideraons, such as legimate expectaons of a shareholdera concept tradionally rooted in fairness as evaluated by an objecve standard. Addionally, these rights may emanate from statutory provisions (such as secon 49(2) of the Companies Act of 2007), contractual agreements (such as shareholder agreements), equity interests in the company, and the governance structures that dene the companys management framework and decision-making processes. Moreover, duciary dues and responsibilies owed by directors may also give rise to addional legal rights and obligaons beyond the connes of the arcles of associaon. However, the boom line is that both the claim of the shareholder and the granng of that relief by the company must have a legal foundaon. [emphasis added]

I shall now proceed to consider the facts of this appeal bearing the above in mind. Acon under the Companies Act By way of a peon led in terms of Secons 210 and 211 of the Act of 1982 in the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo exercising commercial jurisdicon [the Commercial High Court/the High Court], the Peoner Respondent [the Peoner], Dr. Renatus Diederich Gebhard Wilhelm Koehn alleged that the aairs of the 1st Respondent company, Dynavision Broadcasng Company (Pvt) Limited, are being conducted by the 2nd Respondent, Indulakshin Wickremasinghe Senanayake and the 3rd Respondent, Premalal Wickremasinghe Senanayake in a manner oppressive to the Peoners rights as a shareholder in the 1st Respondent company and that the aairs of the 1st Respondent are being conducted by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the 1st Respondent. The 1st 5th Respondents Appellants [the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th Respondents or collecvely the Respondents] thereaer led their Objecons relang to the maers pleaded in the said peon. The High Court, having considered the maers contained in the pleadings and documents led by the pares delivered its judgment on 24th October 2002 granng the Peoner the relief that had been prayed for. Aggrieved, the Respondents invoked the appellate jurisdicon of this Court under and in terms of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996. There is one maer that I wish to advert to at this stage. The averments contained in the Objecons of the 1st 5th Respondents were supported only by an adavit of Asoka De Z Gunasekera, a director of the 4th Respondent. The Peoner claimed that this adavit must be rejected as the 4th Respondent was neither a director nor a shareholder of the 1st Respondent and hence did not have any personal knowledge of the maers pleaded in the objecons. Although the High Court has agreed with that posion, it had done so only aer considering the posions of both pares on the merits. While there is merit in the conclusion reached by the High Court, I shall not venture to consider the competence of Asoka De Z Gunasekera to arm to the maers stated in the Objecons led on behalf of the 1st 5th Respondents but would instead decide this maer on the material tendered by all pares to the High Court.

Background facts The Peoner, who passed away while this appeal was pending and was substuted by his son, was a German naonal. He was employed at Detecon, a company registered and based in Germany. The 2nd Respondent was the agent of Detecon in Sri Lanka. The Peoner had visited Sri Lanka for the rst me in 1993. He had returned to Sri Lanka in 1994 as the Project Manager of Detecon which by then had been retained to provide expert technological services in the expansion of the telephone network in Sri Lanka. The Peoner states that during this period, he developed a friendship with the 2nd Respondent who it is claimed had encouraged the Peoner to invest in a project in Sri Lanka that was being promoted by the 2nd Respondent. The Peoner claims that he thus became the foreign collaborator and investor in establishing the 1st Respondent, which was incorporated as a private company on 23rd August 1994. It is admied that the 2nd Respondent, on behalf of the 1st Respondent and the 4th Respondent, I.W.S. Holdings (Pvt) Limited, made an applicaon to the 6th Respondent, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka on 12th August 1994 to establish a television transmission and distribuon service in Sri Lanka [the Project]. The 6th Respondent had accordingly granted approval for the Project by its leer dated 7th March 1995 [A4], subject to the condions contained therein, which inter alia contained the following: (a) A limited liability company, that being the 1st Respondent, shall be incorporated to implement the Project; (b) The Peoner, being the foreign equity collaborator shall invest a minimum sum of

USD 150,000 as equity capital for the project; (c) The local collaborator shall obtain the prior approval of the Controller of Exchange for the issue of shares in the proposed company to the Peoner;

(d) The equity shares held by the Peoner would be 6% of the paid up capital of the

proposed company;

10

(e) The local collaborator shall enter into a joint venture agreement with the foreign

collaborator seng out the basis for the collaboraon; (f) The Memorandum and Arcles of Associaon of the proposed company shall be approved by the 6th Respondent; (g) The local collaborator shall ensure that shares in the proposed company are issued soon aer its incorporaon and that the 6th Respondent is informed of those appointed to the Board of Directors. Investment by the Peoner in the 1st Respondent The 1st Respondent was incorporated as a private company on 23rd August 1994 [A6]. According to the Form 48 tendered at the me of incorporaon [A7a], the directors of the company were the 2nd Respondent and the 3rd Respondent. The 2nd and 3rd Respondents had connued to be directors of the 1st Respondent in 1996 [A7b], in 1997[A7c] and during the me the transacons that are the subject maer of this appeal were carried out. According to the Memorandum of Associaon of the 1st Respondent [A5], the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent was Rs. Ten million divided into One million shares of Rs. Ten each, with the right to increase or reduce the share capital. A5 provided further that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents had subscribed to one share each in the 1st Respondent. Thus, at the me of incorporaon of the 1st Respondent, only 2 shares had been issued. 999,998 shares in the 1st Respondent remained unalloed, with the claim of the Peoner being that the enre 999,998 shares must be alloed to him since he provided the enrety of the capital of the 1st Respondent and was the only equity investor. The Peoner states that although he was only required to invest USD 150,000, at the request of the 2nd Respondent, the Peoner had invested a further sum of USD 100,000. It is admied that the Peoner and the 4th Respondent entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on 26th October 1995 [A14], with the 2nd and 3rd Respondents signing A14 on behalf of the 4th Respondent to reect such further investment.

11

A14 provided inter alia as follows: (a) The Peoner has invested USD 150,000 in the 1st Respondent in March 1995; (b) The Peoner shall invest a further sum of USD 100,000 in the 1st Respondent on or

before 31st October 1995 subject to the authorised capital of the 1st Respondent being increased to Rs. 50 million before 31st October 1995; (c) Thereaer, 30% of the shares in the 1st Respondent will be allocated to the Collaborator. However, the percentage of the shares will change on a pro-rata basis if the capital is increased; (d) The Peoner shall be a member of the Board of Directors and shall serve as a

consultant to the 1st Respondent for which the Peoner shall be paid a monthly fee of Rs. 100,000. Has the Peoner been deprived of his rights as a shareholder? It is admied by the Respondents that the Peoner had invested the aforemenoned sum of USD 250,000 in the 1st Respondent. The Peoner claims that this investment was made as consideraon for the purchase of shares in the 1st Respondent. Although payment was made in 1994 and 1995, the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent was not increased to Rs. 50 million nor were shares in the 1st Respondent company alloed to the Peoner unl 26th March 2001. Furthermore, the Peoner was not appointed as a director of the 1st Respondent, with it being admied that the 1st Respondent funconed at all mes with only the 2nd and 3rd Respondents as its directors. As proof of the oppressive conduct of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents towards him, the Peoner claims that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents: (a) failed to appoint the Peoner as a director of the 1st Respondent; (b) prevented the Peoner from parcipang in the aairs of the 1st Respondent;

12

(c) did not allot to the Peoner shares in the 1st Respondent company in a mely

manner; (d) deprived the Peoner of his rights as a shareholder; and (e) had acted in concert and colluded to manage the aairs of the 1st Respondent. The Peoner claims that these acons are in contravenon of the understanding set out in A14 and are oppressive of his rights as a shareholder of the 1st Respondent. Allotment of shares in the 1st Respondent The Peoner states that the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent [i.e. Rs. Ten million] and the number of shares issued at the me of incorporaon of the 1st Respondent [i.e. the two subscriber shares issued to the 2nd and 3rd Respondents] remained the same even as at 26th March 2001. The laer is reected in the Companies Form No. 7 tendered to the Registrar of Companies on 17th May 2001 [A11] under the signature of the 2nd Respondent. A further declaraon had been made on Companies Form No.7 and submied to the Registrar of Companies on 17th May 2001 [A3], under the signature of the 2nd Respondent. A3 conrms that 1,262,930 shares in the 1st Respondent had been alloed to the Peoner and that as at 29th March 2001, the Peoner holds the said number of shares. The Peoner however states that with the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent being only Rs. Ten million and with only 999,998 shares le to be alloed, only 999,998 shares stands lawfully alloed to the Peoner and that the balance shares [1,262,930 999,998 = 262,932] have not been lawfully alloed. However, as the Peoner has already paid for the said 262,932 shares by way of the capital input of USD 250,000, the Peoner states that the said sum had been accounted as a loan by the Peoner to the 1st Respondent. Together with the above allotment of shares to the Peoner, the 2nd and 3rd Respondent had purported to issue a total of 20,737,068 shares, of which 6,714,466 had been alloed to the 2nd Respondent, with a further 4,501,496 and 9,521,106 shares alloed to the 4th Respondent and 5th Respondent, Dynacom Engineering (Pvt) Limited, respecvely. The

13

Peoner claims that the 4th and 5th Respondents are owned and/or controlled by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents. The Companies Form No. 7 [A13a] and No. 8 [A13b] in respect of the above allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents had been tendered to the Registrar of Companies on 23rd May 2001, which is six days aer the submission of A3. The Peoner states that although the above shares had been alloed to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents, no payment has been made by the said Respondents for the said shares. Instead, A13a states that shares issued in view of balance outstanding in the company accounts for purposes of selement, and A13b states that, shares issued for the selement of credit balances in the companys account. Dierently put, it was the posion of the Respondents that the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents have provided services to the 1st Respondent and the allotment of shares was in lieu of payment for such services. The claim of the Respondents that they have provided services to the 1st Respondent and that payment is due for such services has been challenged by the Peoner who claims that the fact that payment is due for such services is not reected in the audited accounts of the 1st Respondent. This is a maer that I shall refer to later in this judgment. Furthermore, the Peoner has pointed out that although the value of the shares so alloed was Rs. 207,370,680, the value of the services provided by the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents was only Rs. 30,276,119. Thus, even if the posion of the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents that they provided services to the 1st Respondent is accepted, and on a best case scenario for the Respondents, the fact is they have only paid Rs. 1.46 per share for a Ten rupee share, with the balance sums of money due and owing to the 1st Respondent. The Peoner claims that the eect of the above exercise is that the Respondents have pushed the Peoner from being a majority shareholder to that of a minority shareholder holding only 5.75% and gained control of the 1st Respondent. It is the posion of the Peoner that with the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent being only Rs. Ten million, and with the One million shares in the 1st Respondent already having been alloed as aforesaid to the Peoner and the two subscribers, the 1st Respondent could not have issued a further 20,737,068 shares over and above its authorised share capital, without amending the Memorandum of Associaon of the 1st Respondent. The Peoner had stated further that in August 2001 his Aorneys-at-Law had carried out a search at the oce of the Registrar of Companies

14

of the documents relang to the 1st Respondent and that no resoluon to increase the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent had been submied by that me. The Peoner claims that the issuance of the said 20,737,068 shares has diluted his shareholding of 99.98% in the 1st Respondent to 5.75% and that the intenon of the Respondents has been to gain majority control of the 1st Respondent, without making any contribuon of equity to the 1st Respondent. The Peoner claims that the said acons of the Respondents are fraudulent and oppressive of his rights as a shareholder in the 1st Respondent. Thus, it is the legality of the above allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents that formed the subject maer of the acon in the High Court, with the Peoner claiming the following relief: 01. A declaraon that the authorised Share Capital of the company is Rs. Ten Million; 02. A declaraon that the Peoner is the lawful holder of 999,998 fully paid-up

ordinary shares of Rs.Ten each; 03. A declaraon that the allotment of 20,737,068 ordinary shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th

Respondents is null and void and of no force and avail in law; 04. A declaraon that 2nd and 3rd Respondents are not t and proper persons to funcon

as directors of the 1st Respondent. Objecons led by the Respondents The posion of the Respondents was that the Peoner approached the 2nd Respondent to explore the possibility of securing a resident visa for the Peoner to reside in Sri Lanka and that the 2nd Respondent had arranged for the Peoner to be a collaborator in the 1st Respondent with the sole intenon of enabling the Peoner to reside in Sri Lanka. The Respondents have stated further that a monthly consultancy fee of Rs. 100,000 was paid to the Peoner, it being the return on the monies contributed by the Peoner. The Respondents thus claim that the monies that were brought in to Sri Lanka by the Peoner were not brought in as an investment in the 1st Respondent.

15

Quite apart from the approval granted by the Board of Investment for the Peoner to be the foreign collaborator and investor, I have already noted that the receipt of USD 250,000 and the fact that it was towards the equity capital of the 1st Respondent have been acknowledged by the Respondents vide A14 signed by the 2nd Respondent. The fact that such monies were ulised as payment for the shares in the 1st Respondent and that shares were in fact alloed to the Peoner is conrmed by A3, which too has been signed by the 2nd Respondent, and is reected in the Financial Statement and the Report of the Auditors [A15a] as part of the Share Applicaon Account. The subsequent allotment of shares in the 1st Respondent to the Peoner negates the argument of the Respondents that the 2nd Respondent was only helping the Peoner to obtain a resident visa to operate a hotel in Kandy, and that the Peoner was not entled to any shares in the 1st Respondent. Thus, the posion taken up by the Respondents that the Peoner was not entled to shares in the 1st Respondent is not tenable. I must perhaps at this stage reiterate the posion of the Peoner that even as at August 2001, the records in respect of the 1st Respondent maintained at the oce of the Registrar of Companies did not reect any increase in its authorised share capital. I reiterate this for the reason that the posion of the Respondents is that the allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents was carried out only aer the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent was increased by the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent and subsequently at an extraordinary general meeng in accordance with its Memorandum and Arcles. The Respondents had produced with its Objecons the following three decisions taken by the 1st Respondent, the cumulave eect of which the Respondents claim are to increase the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent and to thereaer allot shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents: (1) The rst decision [R3] is that of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent taken

on 7th March 2001 to increase the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent from Rs. 10 million to Rs. 500 million. (2) The second decision [R4] too is that of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent,

taken on 26th March 2001 to allot shares in the 1st Respondent to the Peoner, as

16

well as to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents in the quanes in which I have already referred to. The Board of Directors have also resolved to increase the authorised share capital from Rs. 10 million to Rs. 500 million in order to give eect to the foregoing allotment of shares.

(3) The third decision [R5], taken on 27th March 2001 at an extraordinary general

meeng of the 1st Respondent, is also to increase the authorised share capital from Rs. 10 million to Rs. 500 million.

I am of the view that the legality of R3, R4 and R5 must be considered sequenally. However, the decisions reected in each of the documents need not be combined, even though each document, taken individually and/or cumulavely, is evidence of the oppressive conduct that the Respondents sought to engage in through each of the decisions contained in R3, R4 and R5.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Peoner submied that: (a) The increase in the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent reected in each of the above three decisions vide R3, R4 and R5 have not been carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act and the Memorandum and Arcles of the 1st Respondent and is therefore invalid; (b) The allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents as per R4 could only be

carried out consequent to an increase in the authorised share capital, as the authorised share capital that stood as at 26th March 2001 was only Rs. Ten million. Hence, the Peoners posion is that such allotment of shares too are of no force in law; (c) As a result of these acons, the Peoners rights as the majority shareholder have been diluted and that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents have gained control of the 1st Respondent and is conducng its aairs in a manner that is oppressive to the Peoner and prejudicial to the interests of the 1st Respondent.

17

The High Court declared that the increase in the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent and the allocaon of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents are bad in law and granted the Peoner the relief prayed for. It is the legality of these acons of the Respondents that are the subject maer of this appeal. In considering the complaint of the Peoner and the legality of R3, R4 and R5, I shall rst examine the provisions of the Act of 1982 relang to the increasing of the authorised share capital of a company and the allotment of shares, and thereaer consider the arguments of the learned Counsel for the Respondents in the light of the ndings of the High Court. The Memorandum and Arcles of Associaon In terms of Clause 5 of the Memorandum of Associaon of the 1st Respondent [A5], the authorised share capital of the Company is Rs. Ten Million divided into One Million shares of Rs. Ten each, with the right to increase or reduce the shares. The nal page of A5 reects the fact that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents have subscribed to one share each. Secon 62(1) of the Act reads as follows:

A company limited by shares or a company limited by guarantee and having a share capital, if so authorised by its arcles, may alter the condions of its memorandum as follows, that is to say, it may

(a) increase its share capital by new shares of such amount as it thinks expedient; (b) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount

than its exisng shares; (c) convert all or any of its paid-up shares into stock, and reconvert that stock into paid-up shares of any denominaon; (d) subdivide its shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than is xed

by the memorandum, so however, that in the sub-division the proporon between the amount paid and the amount, if any, unpaid on each reduced

18

share shall be the same as it was in the case of the share from which the reduced share is derived: (e) cancel shares which, at the date of the passing of the resoluon in that behalf,

have not been taken or agreed to be taken by any person, and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled. Secon 62(2) provides further that, The powers conferred by the provisions of this secon shall be exercised by the company at a general meeng. Secon 64 of the Act, which reads as follows, imposes a requirement to inform the Registrar of any increase in the share capital:

(1) Where a company having a share capital, whether its shares have or have not

been converted into stock, has increased its share capital beyond the registered capital, it shall with een days from the date of passing of the resoluon authorising the increase, give to the Registrar noce thereof and the Registrar shall record such increase. (2) The noce to be given under the provisions of sub secon (1) shall include such

parculars as may be prescribed with respect to the classes of shares aected and the condions subject to which the new shares have been or are to be issued, and the company shall forward to the Registrar together with such noce a copy of the resoluon authorising such increase. (3) Where default is made in complying with the provisions of this secon, the

company and every ocer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an oence and shall be liable to a default ne. The argument of the Peoner that the provisions of Secon 64 have not been complied with in respect of the purported increase in the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent has not been disputed by the Respondents.

19

Arcle 7 of the Arcles of Associaon of the 1st Respondent provides that, the shares shall be under the control of the Directors who may issue and allot them only to such persons as may be approved by the Board of Directors in wring. Arcle 13 of the Arcles of Associaon provides further that:

Unl otherwise determined by a general meeng:

(1) Two directors including the Chairman or his alternate shall form a quorum for

a Directors meeng; (2) Two members present in person or by proxy shall form a quorum for a general

meeng. The cumulave eect of the above provisions can be summarised as follows: (a) Any increase in the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent shall be preceded by a resoluon to amend the Memorandum of Associaon to reect such an increase and such resoluon shall be passed by its shareholders at a general meeng; (b) The authorised share capital of a company cannot be increased by the Board of

Directors; (c) The Registrar must be informed within 15 days of any increase of the authorised share capital, and a copy of the resoluon shall be served on the Registrar;

(d) The required quorum for a meeng of the Board of Directors shall be two including

the Chairman;

(e) The Board of Directors shall have the power to allot shares to such persons as may

be approved by them.

20

Meeng held on 7th March 2001 R3 I have already stated that the share capital of the 1st Respondent at the me of its incorporaon was Rs. Ten million consisng of One million shares of Rs. Ten each, with the Peoner claiming that the enrety of the capital was contributed by him and that he is therefore entled to 999,998 shares in the 1st Respondent. I must state that even though the claim of the Peoner that he is entled to 99.98% of the shares in the 1st Respondent is based on the premise that he is the sole equity contributor to the 1st Respondent, it was sought to be argued by the learned Counsel for the Respondents before us that such posion, on the face of it, is contradicted by A14 which states that the Peoner shall be entled to be alloed only 30% of the shares upon the addional sum of USD 100,000 being invested. I must state that this posion has not been taken up by the Respondents in their Objecons before the High Court nor have they sought to explain this provision in A14. I have carefully considered paragraph 1 of A14 in its enrety and what it provides for is the xing of the shareholding of the Peoner at 30% only aer the authorised share capital is increased to Rs. 50 million. In other words, there is recognion that the Peoner shall be entled to 30% aer addional capital is brought in and the authorised share capital is increased to Rs. 50 million, with a qualicaon that the percentage of the shares will change on a pro-rata basis if the capital is increased further. While this gives credence to the posion of the Peoner that he was entled to 99.98% of the shares unl then, the limitaon of the Peoners shareholding to 30% was conngent upon the authorised share capital being increased, which however has not taken place. In these circumstances, I am not in agreement with the submission that A14 only provided the Peoner the right to hold a maximum shareholding of 30% at any given me. The Respondents have produced marked R3 the minutes of a meeng of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent held on 7th March 2001 in the oce of the 2nd Respondent relang to the Capitalisaon of Dynavision Assets and Dr. Koehns investment. According to R3, four persons were present at the meeng, including the 2nd Respondent in his capacity as Chairman of the 1st Respondent, Asoka De Z Gunasekera, a Group Director but who was not a director of the 1st Respondent, and two others. According to R3, it had been decided inter alia to:

21

(a) Increase the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent to Rs. 500 million; (b) Increase the paid up capital to Rs. 210 million inclusive of the contribuon of the

Peoner; (c) Transfer the balance of the creditors account and issue shares in favour of the 2nd and 4th Respondents; (d) Arrange for the issuance of shares to Dr. Koehn upto 5%. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Peoner submied that R3 is only the minutes of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent, and not the minutes of a general meeng of the shareholders of the 1st Respondent. Quite apart from the fact that the required quorum of two directors was not present at the said meeng, it is not within the power of the Board of Directors to increase the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent. Thus, in the absence of a resoluon placed before the shareholders to amend Clause 5 of the Memorandum of Associaon and such resoluon being passed by the shareholders, any increase in the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent reected in R3 is ultra vires the Memorandum of the 1st Respondent. Probably for this reason, the 1st Respondent has not acted in terms of Secon 64 of the Act and informed the Registrar of any increase in the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent nor has a copy of the said resoluon been led with the Registrar. Any decision to allot shares taken consequenal to such decision also suer the same fate. With the decision taken at the said meeng of 7th March 2001 being invalid, it was the posion of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Peoner that the status quo that prevailed as at 7th March 2001 connued, with the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent being Rs. Ten million and the 2nd and 3rd Respondents holding one share each. The High Court has considered the above maers and accepted the posion of the Peoner that (a) the authorised share capital can only be increased at a general meeng of the 1st Respondent and that the purported increase of the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents is ultra vires the Memorandum of the

22

1st Respondent, and (b) the board meeng held on 7th March 2001 is not a valid meeng and all decisions taken at the said meeng are invalid. The simple argument that the Respondents was thus required to meet in this Court was whether R3 is a decision of the shareholders of the 1st Respondent taken at a general meeng. It is admied in the wrien submissions tendered on behalf of the Respondents on 3rd January 2024 that in order to increase the authorised share capital, a board resoluon is not sucient and that such a decision must be taken at a general meeng of the company. To my mind, the maer ends there and the decision taken on 7th March 2001 is indeed invalid. The High Court was therefore correct on this maer. R3 gives context to the overall manipulaon that the Respondents were about to engage in. Meeng held on 26th March 2001 R4 The Respondents produced marked R4 the minutes of the meeng of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent held on 26th March 2001, which are re-produced below:

The Board considered the Companys monthly accounts for February 2001 and noted that a sum of Rs. 12,468,084.76 was payable to Dynacom Engineering Private Limited which they noted was in respect of rent, electricity and standby power expenses of the company during the last six years which had been paid by the said company. It was also noted that the said company had requested that they be alloed shares for a total consideraon of Rs. 13,900,814.76 inclusive of a sum of Rs.1,432,730 lying to the credit of Dynacom Engineering Trunking Pvt Ltd which has now been merged with the company. The Board further noted the following credit balances of Dr Koehn, IWS Holdings and Mr I.W. Senanayake and authorised the Managing Director to transfer these balances to the call account aer obtaining the necessary documentaon from them.

23

Dr. Koehn Rs. 12,620,300 IWS Holdings Rs. 6,573,808 Mr. I W Senanayake Rs. 9,805,532 Rs. 29,008,640

The Board resolved that in terms of Arcle 7 of the Arcles of Associaon of the company Rs. 220 million divided into 22,000,000 shares of Rs. 10 each be issued as follows: IWS Holdings - 4,501,496 Mr. I W Senanayake - 6,714,466 Dr. Koehn - 1,262,930 Dynacom Engineering 9,521,106 Mr. I W Senanayake 1 Sub. Share Mr. P W Senanayake ------------- 1 Sub. Share 22,000,000 of which 20,737,068 was to be partly paid shares of Rs.10 each and 1,262,932 fully paid shares of Rs. 10 each. It was noted that Rs. 1.46 per share had been called up on the partly paid shares as follows: IWS Holdings - 6,572,184.16 Mr. I W Senanayake - 9,803,120.36 Dynacom Engineering - 13,900,814.76 30,276,119.28 and that the paid up capital of the company will be Rs. 42,905,439.28. The Board further resolved that to give eect to the foregoing that the authorised share capital of the company be increased from Rs. 10 million divided into 1 million shares of Rs. 10 each to Rs. 500 million by the creaon of 49,000,000 shares of Rs. 10 each ranking equally and pari passu with the exisng ordinary shares of Rs. 10 each with the right to increase or reduce.

24

While this is a maer that I shall refer to in detail later in this judgment, I must state that even though the Respondents had every opportunity of doing so, the Respondents did not le with their Objecons: (a) any documents to support its posion in R4 that services have been provided to the

1st Respondent by the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents; (b) the monthly accounts of the 1st Respondent for the month of February 2001 which formed the basis for the allotment in favour of the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents. In my view, the failure to do so on the part of the Respondents was crical since shares were being alloed as consideraon for such services. I must also observe that even though the partners of the audit and accountants rm of the 1st Respondent too had been named as the 11th and 12th Respondents, they too chose not to tender any material in that regard. R4 accordingly reects the decision of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent to increase the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent. I must perhaps state that there was no necessity to increase the authorised share capital once again if such an increase had already taken place on 7th March 2001 as reected in R3. In any event, R4 too are minutes of a meeng of the Board of Directors and quite apart from the absence of a resoluon to amend the Memorandum, the decision to increase the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent has not been taken at a general meeng of the shareholders. Thus, the increase in the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent that is said to have taken place on 26th March 2001 too is invalid and must suer the same fate as R3. That leaves the maximum number of shares of the 1st Respondent that could have been alloed as at 26th March 2001 at 999,998. The queson is, have these shares been alloed validly and if so, to whom and in what quanes? The learned Presidents Counsel for the Peoner submied that: (a) According to the audited accounts of the 1st Respondent as at 31st March 1997 [A15a] and as at 31st March 1998 [A15b], which incidentally were the latest audited

25

accounts of the 1st Respondent that were available to the High Court, a sum of Rs.9,999,980.00 had been transferred to the Share Applicaon Account of the 1st Respondent. The Peoner states that this sum of money is part of the equity contribuon made by the Peoner. (b) When the Board of the 1st Respondent issued 1,262,930 shares to the Peoner on

26th March 2001, the aforesaid sum of money held in the Share Applicaon Account of the 1st Respondent had been ulised as payment for the said shares alloed to the Peoner. It is claimed that the allotment of shares to the Peoner is therefore in order. (c) With 1,262,930 shares having been alloed to the Peoner and with the number of shares as at that date being One million, the 1st Respondent had no other shares that were capable of being alloed and therefore the allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents is null and void;

(d) In any event, the transfer to the call account of the sums of money said to have been

owed to the 2nd and 4th Respondents was aer obtaining the necessary documentaon from them. Thus, the submission on behalf of the Peoner is that 999,998 shares can be alloed to

the Peoner since the consideraon for the payment for such shares, that being the

monies already invested by the Peoner, had passed. Although there is merit in such

submission, since the allotment of shares to the Peoner and the 2nd, 4th and 5th

Respondents have been carried out simultaneously, the above submission of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Peoner sll leaves open the queson of whether the 2nd, 4th

and 5th Respondents too are entled to any shares in the 1st Respondent out of the said

999,998 shares on a pro rata basis and if so, in what quanes. This was in fact one of the

submissions made by the learned Counsel for the Respondents who submied that if

there were only 999,998 shares available for allotment, the said shares must be alloed

proporonate to the allotment that was sought to be eected by R4.

26

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Peoner submied that as pleaded in the peon, the answer to the above queson can be found in A15a and A15b. According to A15a and A15b, the share capital as at 31st March 1996 was Rs. 5,815,000 while as at 31st March 1997 and 31st March 1998, it was Rs. Ten million. According to Note 1 to A15a and A15b, the number of the issued and fully paid share capital as at 31st March 1996 as well as at 31st March 1997 and 31st March 1998 was Rs. 20. However, Note 1 of A15a goes on to state that the monies available in the Share Applicaon Account as at 31st March 1996 was Rs. 5,815,000 and had been contributed by the Peoner while as at 31st March 1997 and 31st March 1998, it was Rs. Ten million, with such sum once again being the contribuon of the Peoner. Thus, as at 31st March 1998, the share capital of the 1st Respondent was only Rs. 20 and the balance Rs. 9,999,980 had been accounted for in the Share Applicaon Account as monies paid by the Peoner. With the audited accounts of the 1st Respondent conrming the availability of the monies invested by the Peoner in the Share Applicaon Account, there was no necessity to call for further documentaon and hence, the said sum of money served as the consideraon for the shares alloed to the Peoner vide R4. On the contrary, the audited accounts upto 31st March 1998 do not reect any

contribuon made by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents towards the capital of the 1st

Respondent other than the two Ten Rupee subscriber shares nor does the audited

accounts of the 1st Respondent reect that the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents have provided

services to the 1st Respondent for which payment was due. Therefore, the basis of

allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents is, on the face of R4, a nullity. I have

already stated that the Respondents failed to present to the High Court even an iota of

evidence to substanate the basis in R4 for the allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th

Respondents, although it was well within their capacity to have done so. Thus, the

condion in R4 to transfer these balances to the call account aer obtaining the necessary

documentaon from them could not have been complied, with the result being that no

shares could have been alloed to the 2nd , 4th and 5th Respondents on 26th March 2001.

The posion of the Peoner is reinforced by the Balance Sheet of the 1st Respondent which forms part of A15a. While the Long Term Loans to the 1st Respondent stood at Rs. 16,652,327.50 as at 31st March 1996, Note 3 to A15a aributes this sum of 16,652,327.50 as being a long term loan from the Peoner. Together with the capital contribuon of Rs.

27

Ten million from the Peoner, all costs associated with the acquision of assets and pre-operaonal expenses as at 31st March 1996 in a sum of Rs. 22,467,328 has been met with the funds of the Peoner. The long term loans had increased to Rs. 25,325,775.30 by 31st March 1997, with Rs. 5 million from the Naonal Development Bank and Rs. 3,673,447.80 from the 4th Respondent in addion to Rs. 16,652,327.50 contributed by the Peoner. The total cost of the acquision of assets and pre-operaonal expenses as at 31st March 1997 was Rs. 28,455,855 but A15a does not demonstrate the infusion of any capital by any of the 2nd 4th Respondents. The posion is no dierent even in A15b. Thus, the Respondents have not been able to establish the passing of consideraon for the allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents, even at Rs.1.46 per share. Thus, my view that even though issued simultaneously, the allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents is invalid is reinforced by the Balance Sheet of the 1st Respondent. The High Court traversed a slightly dierent path although it arrived at the same conclusion that no shares were validly alloed to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents. The High Court observed that the shares alloed to the Peoner had been registered with the Registrar of Companies on 17th May 2001 [A11] and that the 1st Respondent company had already ocially registered shares to the maximum authorised share capital in terms of its Memorandum of Associaon. Thus, by the me A13a was submied to the Registrar of Companies on 23rd May 2001, the maximum number of shares in the 1st Respondent had already been alloed and registered in the name of the Peoner. Hence, the High Court concluded that the shares purported to have been alloed to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents could not have been registered as the shares of the 1st Respondent was limited to 1 million shares. It is in this factual background that the High Court held as follows:

In these circumstances, I am inclined to agree with the submission made by the learned Presidents Counsel that without amending the Memorandum of Associaon of the 1st Respondent company the aforesaid allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents is invalid in as much as the 1st Respondent company had already on 17th May 2001 ocially registered to the maximum authorised shares according to its Memorandum of Associaon. Accordingly the said allotment of shares is invalid

28

and the registraon is ultra vires the memorandum of associaon of the 1st Respondent. I am of the view that on the facts and circumstances of this case the 1st 5th Respondents have acted ultra vires in allong over 20 million of ordinary shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents. Accordingly 4th and 5th Respondents have no right to claim any shares in the 1st Respondent company The learned Counsel for the Respondents sought to argue, in the alternave, that the enrety of the allotment of shares eected on 26th March 2001 was invalid with the result that the Peoner too had not been alloed any shares. The basis for this submission was that the Board of Directors had decided in R4 that the credit balances set out therein must be transferred to the call account aer obtaining the necessary documentaon from the Peoner and the 2nd and 4th Respondents, and that unl then, no allotment of shares can take place. In other words, it was his posion that no allotment of shares to the Peoner or for that maer to the 2nd and 4th Respondents could have taken place on 26th March 2001 unl and unless the necessary documentaon had been tendered. I must observe that the Objecons led before the High Court does not contain any material in support of this submission. Be that as it may, I have already stated that as far as the Peoner was concerned, allotment of shares to the Peoner could not have been condional upon such documentaon being obtained as the audited accounts already recognised such contribuon of the Peoner. Quite apart from the fact that the equity contribuon of the Peoner has been acknowledged by the 1st Respondent and that the audited accounts reected the availability of the monies contributed by the Peoner and therefore there being no need to obtain further documentaon relang to the Peoner, whether such documentaon was given by the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents was a maer within the knowledge of the Respondents. I have already stated that the objecons led by the Respondents in the High Court was silent in this regard. Viewed from that light, no shares could have been alloed to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents on 26th March 2001 at all, and hence on the Respondents own submission, the said allotment could not have been registered as it was sought to be done by A13a.

29

It was further submied on behalf of the Respondents that even if the above condion of subming supporng documents had been sased, the allotment of shares to all the alloees took place simultaneously and can take eect only subsequent to the increase of the authorised share capital which took place on 27th March 2001 vide R5. Whether the increase of the authorised share capital on 27th March 2001 was valid is a maer that I shall consider later. Suce to state at this point that with the High Court taking the view that the increase in the authorised share capital on 27th March 2001 was invalid, the posion of the Respondents appear to be that the allotment of shares to the Peoner too is invalid. I have already concluded, for reasons alluded to earlier, that the allotment of shares to the Peoner on 26th March 2001 was valid and more importantly, that the validity of the shares alloed to the Peoner is not dependant on the validity of R5. This submission of the Respondent does not therefore apply to the shares alloed to the Peoner but would apply to the shares that were sought to be alloed to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents. The High Court had also proceeded on the basis that there already existed 999,998 shares and since the allotment of shares to the Peoner was registered on 17th May 2001 ahead of the Respondents, that gave the Peoner priority over the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents whose shares were submied for registraon only on 23rd May 2001. This was in spite of stamp duty on both allotments having been made on the same date [R8]. The need for me to consider if the said conclusion reached by the High Court is correct does not arise in view of the conclusion reached by me that the allotment of shares that took place on 26th March 2001 was limited to the Peoner. Meeng held on 27th March 2001 R5 Thus, by 26th March 2001, the Peoner was a shareholder of the 1st Respondent, and was entled to noce of any general meeng of the shareholders. The Respondents have produced with their Objecons the minutes of the extraordinary general meeng of the shareholders of the 1st Respondent held on 27th March 2001, marked R5. Only the 2nd and 3rd Respondents were present at the said meeng. R5 reads as follows:

30

Ordinary Resoluon

The Chairman proposed the following ordinary resoluon and was seconded by Mr. P W Senanayake:

That the authorised share capital of the company be increased from Rs. 10 million divided into 1 million shares of Rs. 10 each to Rs. 500 million divided into 50 million shares of Rs. 10 each by the creaon of 49 million shares of Rs. 10 each ranking equally and pari passu with the exisng ordinary shares of Rs. 10 each with the right to increase or reduce. The Shares in the original or any increased capital may be divided into several classes and there may be aached thereto respecvely any preferenal deferred or other special rights privileges condions as to dividend capital vong or otherwise On being put to the meeng the Resoluon was duly carried. The Respondents had also produced another document tled, Consent to short noce [R6], signed by only the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, by which they had consented to the convening of the above extraordinary general meeng to pass the above resoluon notwithstanding that the required number of days for giving noce has not been complied with. Even though no resoluon has been formally presented at the meeng held on 27th March 2001, the shareholders did approve some form of resoluon to increase the authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent. However, as pointed out by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Peoner, the Peoner had become a shareholder by 26th March 2001, as evidenced by R4 and was entled to have been served with a noce to be present at the extraordinary general meeng of the 1st Respondent. While the Peoner pleads ignorance of this meeng, that no noce was served on the Peoner is clearly evident from the fact that it is only the 2nd and 3rd Respondents who consented to dispensing with the minimum noce vide R6. Thus, the Peoner, although holding 999,998 shares in the Respondent on 26th March 2001 did not have noce of a resoluon, if approved, would have resulted in a diluon of his shareholding within the 1st Respondent. Quite apart from whether such a course of

31

acon is contrary to A14, it is clear that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents had manipulated the aairs of the 1st Respondent to such an extent that it was able to convene and conduct general meengs without the Peoner who at that point in me was the sole contributor of the equity capital in the 1st Respondent and was a shareholder thereof. It is in the above circumstances that the learned Presidents Counsel for the Peoner submied that: (a) Even if the resoluon in R5 was valid, the Board of the 1st Respondent did not meet thereaer and allot shares in the 1st Respondent to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents as required by Arcle 13 of the Arcles of Associaon; (b) The Registrar of Companies has not been given noce of the resoluon, as required

by Secon 64 of the Act; (c) The approval of the Board of Investment has not been obtained for the said increase, although that was a condion on which the Board of Investment had granted approval to the Project vide A4; (d) The authorised share capital of the 1st Respondent was never lawfully increased to

allow the allotment of shares to the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents and therefore the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents are not entled to any shares in the 1st Respondent; (e) R3, R4, R5 and R6 are fabricaons prepared for the purposes of this case. The High Court has accepted the posion of the Peoner that the meeng held on 27th March 2001 is also invalid for the reason that no noce has been given of the said extraordinary general meeng of shareholders of the 1st Respondent to the Peoner. The posion of the Respondents was that as at 26th March, 2001 the Peoner had not been alloed shares in the 1st Respondent and was therefore not entled to noce of the extraordinary general meeng that was held on 27th March 2001. For reasons which I have already referred to, I have concluded that the Peoner was in fact alloed shares on 26th March 2001. The Peoner was therefore entled to noce of the extraordinary general meeng. I must also state that the argument of the Respondents that shares could be

alloed prior to increasing the authorised share capital and that once such an increase takes place, the allotment of shares could be given eect is to put the cart before the horse, and must therefore be rejected. Oppression and Mismanagement This brings me to the core issue in this appeal, that being whether the 2nd and 3rd Respondents are guilty of oppression as provided for in Secon 210 of the Companies Act. With regard to the overall conduct of the Respondents, the High Court has held as follows:

The 2nd and 3rd respondents have acted in their own interests by allong shares to themselves and to the 4th and 5th respondent companies owned by the 2nd respondent so as to enable them to take over complete control of the rst respondent company in an illegal manner The conduct on the part of the 2nd and 3rd respondents of unlawfully issuing shares to themselves and the 4th and 5th respondents which are companies more or less fully owned by the 2nd and 3rd respondents is oppressive to the peoner and is an aempt to materially change the ownership of the 1st respondent company By reason of this material change the aairs of the 1st respondent company would be conducted in a manner prejudicial to the said company and to the peoner who is the only other shareholder In my view all these acts of the 2nd to the 5th respondents amounted to oppression of the peoner and also oppression in the conduct of the aairs of the company and the aforesaid conduct is detrimental to both the company and the peoner It Is my considered view that the aforesaid increase of the share capital of the 1st respondent company and the manner and the allotment of shares was made surrepously and deliberately with the ulterior move of dilung the peoners shareholding in the 1st respondent company and with the sole idea of defeang the rights of the peoner. The 2nd to 5th respondents have alloed shares to themselves which had which had seriously aected the proprietary rights of the peoner

To my mind, it is clear that the Respondents had no intenon of allong shares to the Peoner although the Peoner had invested USD 250,000 by 1995. It appears that the Respondents could no longer resist calls from the Peoner that eect be given to the commercial deal struck between them way back in 1994 and 1995 and that, as suggested by the Peoner, hurriedly prepared a series of documents, namely R3, R4 and R5 that would allot the Peoner the minimum possible number of shares and allot to themselves shares in excess of 94%, having only paid Rs. 1.46 per share. In the process the Respondents commied a series of fundamental mistakes relang to the procedure that should have been followed and the Respondents now nd themselves in a more precarious posion than they should be in. I can only agree with the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Peoner that the acons of the Respondents have boomeranged on them in a manner in which it was least expected by the Respondents. The manner in which the rights of the Peoner as a shareholder was sought to be diluted is a clear case of oppression by the Respondents. Here was an investor who invested USD 250,000 in 1994 in return for a majority shareholding in the 1st Respondent and who is now being short changed by the Respondents. Had the Respondents been successful, the Peoner would have lost his investment and been le with just 5.75% shares in the 1st Respondent. Pung aside the legal nicees, should not the Respondents have given eect to their original bargain struck in 1994 and 1995 and alloed shares to the Peoner commensurate with the investment that he had brought in to the 1st Respondent? As I noted at the outset, the 1st Respondent being a private company, its shareholders and collaborators must act in a sense of cooperaon and honesty, respecng each other. The conduct complained of lacks probity, is unfair to the Peoner and has caused prejudice to the legal and proprietary rights of the Peoner as a shareholder. The acts complained of have denied to the Peoner not only his rights as a shareholder but even his legimate expectaons as a shareholder. I am therefore in agreement with the above conclusion reached by the High Court.

Provisions of the Exchange Control Act, No. 24 of 1953 There is one other maer that I must advert to before I conclude. The learned Counsel for the Respondents submied that in terms of the Exchange Control Act, a person who is resident outside Sri Lanka cannot hold shares in a company registered in Sri Lanka except with the permission of the Central Bank. While I shall discuss the said submission in detail later on, I must state at the outset that, (a) R3 R5 does not reect that this was the reason for the Respondents to have done what they did, and (b) this issue was not raised before the High Court. The learned Counsel for the Respondents however submied that this was a pure queson of law and can therefore be raised for the rst me in appeal. I am afraid I cannot agree. For reasons that I shall express, my view is that this issue does not sasfy the test laid down in Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera Menike v Rohini Senanayake [(1992) 2 Sri LR 180] and Sirimewan Maha Mudalige Kalyani Sirimewan v Herath Mudiyanselage Gunarath Menike [SC Appeal 47/2017; SC minutes of 10th May 2024] for determining if an issue is a pure queson of law, and whether such issue could therefore be raised for the rst me in appeal. Be that as it may, I shall consider the said submission as the learned Counsel for the Respondents placed much reliance on that submission. There are three secons of the Exchange Control Act which were relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Respondents, they being Secons 10, 11 and 30. Secon 10 inter alia prohibits any person who is resident outside Sri Lanka from being the transferee of any security which is registered or is to be registered in Sri Lanka except with the permission of the Central Bank. Secon 11 prohibits any person from inter alia transferring any registered security to any person who is resident outside Sri Lanka except with the permission of the Central Bank. The learned Counsel for the Peoner submied further that in terms of Secon 30(5), Except with the general or special permission of the bank no person resident in Sri Lanka shall transfer any interest in any business in Sri Lanka or create any interest in any such business, to or in favour of a cizen of a foreign state.

35

The learned Counsel for the Respondents drew our aenon to the following paragraphs of the Noce issued under the Exchange Control Act in terms of Secons 10,11,15 and 30(5) of the said Act published in Gazee Extraordinary No. 721/4 dated 29th June 1992:

1. Permission - Permission is hereby granted for the purposes of Secons 10, 11,

15 and sub-secon 5 of secon 30 as applicable of the Exchange Control Act (Chapter 423 of the CLE), for the issue and transfer of shares in a company upto 100% of the issued capital of such company, to approved country funds, approved regional funds, corporate bodies incorporated outside Sri Lanka and individuals resident outside Sri Lanka (inclusive of Sri Lankans resident outside Sri Lanka) subject to the exclusions, limitaons and condions hereinaer set out. 2. Exclusions The permission hereby granted shall not apply in respect of shares of a company proposing to carry on or carrying on any of the following businesses: (i) Money lending, (ii) Pawn Broking, (iii) Retail trade with a capital of less than one Million U.S. Dollars, (iv) Providing personal services other than for the export or tourism sectors, (v) Coastal shing.

3. Limitaons (a) The permission hereby granted shall apply in respect of shares in a company carrying on or proposing to carry on any of the following businesses only upto 40% of the issued capital of such company, or if approval has been granted by the Greater Colombo Economic Commission for a higher percentage of foreign investment in any company, only upto such higher percentage.

(i) (ix) (x) Mass communicaons; (xi) (xv)

36

It was the posion of the learned Counsel for the Respondents that the 1st Respondent is a company that is engaged in mass communicaon and that a person who is a cizen of a foreign state is prohibited by law from owning anything more than 40% of the shares in a company such as the 1st Respondent. There are two things that I must state. The rst is that at least as far as Secons 10 and 11 are concerned, the criterion for deciding whether any of the above provisions apply is the residence of the individual concerned. Secons 10 and 11 apply to persons who are resident outside Sri Lanka and the restricons in the above menoned Noce applies in respect of those who are resident outside Sri Lanka. In paragraphs 7 16 of the Objecons led before the High Court and parcularly in paragraph 13 thereof, the Respondents have submied that the Peoner had a resident visa and was operang a guest house in Kandy. This fact has been reiterated in paragraph 22 of the wrien submissions tendered on 3rd January 2024. According to the Direcon given by the Minister of Finance under Secon 37(1) of the Exchange Control Act and published in the Ceylon Government Gazee No. 15,007 of 21st April 1972, Cizens of foreign countries who are in Ceylon, except passengers in transit to other countries or visitors touring the country for pleasure or business are treated as resident in Ceylon for the purpose of determining the residenal status of persons under the Exchange Control Act. Thus, I am sased that the Peoner was a resident for the purposes of the Exchange Control Act and the restricons in Secons 10 and 11 would not apply to the Peoner. The second is that the prohibion contained in the Exchange Control Act on the transfer of shares is not a blanket prohibion and such transfers can be carried out with the permission of the Central Bank. Whether such approval will be granted is a queson of fact and I do not have before me all the facts to decide this queson. This is the reason for the view expressed by me that the Respondents ought to have raised this issue before the High Court and that this is not a pure queson of law that can be raised for the rst me in appeal.

37

Furthermore, it was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Peoner that the Controller of Exchange was a party to the acon and had this issue been raised before the High Court, a sasfactory explanaon could have been oered by the Controller of Exchange or by one or more of the other pares as to the legality of whether the Peoner can hold 999,998. However, this was not to be due to the failure of the Respondents to raise this issue before the High Court. Conclusion I am in agreement with the view expressed by the High Court that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents (a) have acted in an oppressive manner with regard to the rights of the Peoner as a shareholder in the 1st Respondent, and (b) are aempng to dilute the shareholding of the Peoner in such a manner that would enable the Respondents to gain control of the 1st Respondent without invesng any moneys in the 1st Respondent and in the process deny the Peoner his rights and legimate expectaons as a shareholder. I would therefore arm the judgment of the High Court. This appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.
