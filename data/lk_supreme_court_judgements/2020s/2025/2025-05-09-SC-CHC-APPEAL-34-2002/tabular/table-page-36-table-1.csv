"It was the posi(cid:415)on of the learned Counsel for the Respondents that the 1st Respondent is"
"a company that is engaged in mass communica(cid:415)on and that a person who is a ci(cid:415)zen of a"
"foreign state is prohibited by law from owning anything more than 40% of the shares in a"
"company such as the 1st Respondent."
"T
here are two things that I must state."
"T
he  ﬁrst  is  that  at  least  as  far  as  Sec(cid:415)ons  10  and  11  are  concerned,  the  criterion  for"
"deciding  whether  any  of  the  above  provisions  apply  is  the  residence  of  the  individual"
"concerned. Sec(cid:415)ons 10 and 11 apply to persons who are resident outside Sri Lanka and"
"the  restric(cid:415)ons  in  the  above  men(cid:415)oned  No(cid:415)ce  applies  in  respect  of  those  who  are"
"resident outside Sri Lanka. In paragraphs 7 – 16 of the Objec(cid:415)ons ﬁled before the High"
"Court and par(cid:415)cularly in paragraph 13 thereof, the Respondents have submi(cid:425)ed that the"
"Pe(cid:415)(cid:415)oner had a resident visa and was opera(cid:415)ng a guest house in Kandy. This fact has been"
"reiterated in paragraph 22 of the wri(cid:425)en submissions tendered on 3rd January 2024."
"A
ccording to the Direc(cid:415)on given by the Minister of Finance under Sec(cid:415)on 37(1) of the"
"Exchange Control Act and published in the Ceylon Government Gaze(cid:425)e No. 15,007 of 21st"
"April 1972, “Ci(cid:415)zens of foreign countries who are in Ceylon, except passengers in transit"
"to other countries or visitors touring the country for pleasure or business” are treated as"
"‘resident in Ceylon’ “for the purpose of determining the residen(cid:415)al status of persons under"
"the Exchange Control Act”. Thus, I am sa(cid:415)sﬁed that the Pe(cid:415)(cid:415)oner was a resident for the"
"purposes of the Exchange Control Act and the restric(cid:415)ons in Sec(cid:415)ons 10 and 11 would not"
"apply to the Pe(cid:415)(cid:415)oner."
"T
he second is that the prohibi(cid:415)on contained in the Exchange Control Act on the transfer"
"of  shares  is  not  a  blanket  prohibi(cid:415)on  and  such  transfers  can  be  carried  out  with  the"
"permission of the Central Bank. Whether such approval will be granted is a ques(cid:415)on of"
"fact and I do not have before me all the facts to decide this ques(cid:415)on. This is the reason"
"for the view expressed by me that the Respondents ought to have raised this issue before"
"the High Court and that this is not a pure ques(cid:415)on of law that can be raised for the ﬁrst"
"(cid:415)me in appeal."
