"submi(cid:427)ng suppor(cid:415)ng documents had been sa(cid:415)sﬁed, the allotment of shares to all the"

"I shall consider later. Suﬃce to state at this point that with the High Court taking the view"
"that  the  increase  in  the  authorised  share  capital  on  27th  March  2001  was  invalid,  the"
"posi(cid:415)on of the Respondents appear to be that the allotment of shares to the Pe(cid:415)(cid:415)oner"
"too is invalid. I have already concluded, for reasons alluded to earlier, that the allotment"
"of shares to the Pe(cid:415)(cid:415)oner on 26th March 2001 was valid and more importantly, that the"
"validity of the shares allo(cid:425)ed to the Pe(cid:415)(cid:415)oner is not dependant on the validity of R5. This"
"submission  of  the  Respondent  does  not  therefore  apply  to  the  shares  allo(cid:425)ed  to  the"
"Pe(cid:415)(cid:415)oner but would apply to the shares that were sought to be allo(cid:425)ed to the 2nd, 4th and"
"5th Respondents."
