"18. The essence of the preliminary objections raised by DFCC Bank was"
"founded  on  the  assertion  that  the  claim  application,  styled  and"
"numbered as DCL/0003/2016, constituted a separate and misconceived"
"proceeding.  The  contention  was  that,  if  at  all,  such  an  application"
"ought  properly  to  have  been  filed  in  the  main  debt  recovery  action"
"bearing Case No. DDR/137/2014. Upon inquiry into these objections,"
"the  learned  District  Judge  overruled  them  and  fixed  the  matter  for"
"inquiry."
