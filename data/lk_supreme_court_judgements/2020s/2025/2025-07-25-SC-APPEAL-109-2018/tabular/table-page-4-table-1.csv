"5. During the pendency of Debt Recovery Action No. DDR/137/2014, the"
"DFCC Bank made an application seeking the issuance of sequestration"
"orders  under  Section  653  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  (CPC),  with  a"
"view to securing any decree that may be entered in its favour for the"
"recovery of sums of Rs. 87,538,561.34 and Rs. 7,666,923.97."
"6. Upon the issuance of sequestration orders in its favour under Section"
"653 of the Civil Procedure Code, the DFCC Bank, as Plaintiff in the"
"Debt Recovery action, caused notice of the sequestration orders to be"
"served  on  LOLC  Securities  Limited  (sometimes  referred  to  in  this"
"judgment as LOLC) through its Attorneys-at-Law, directing them not"
"to alienate or transfer any assets that were subject to the said orders."
"7. On the question of assets thus sequestered or seized, Lord McNaughten"
"had said poignantly: “A creditor of the bankrupt having duly obtained"
"an attachment in England before the date of the sequestration cannot,"
"I think, be deprived of the fruits of his diligence.”1"
"8. Before  proceeding  to  the  remaining  facts,  it  is  appropriate  to  briefly"
"refer to the concept of sequestration in civil procedure. Sequestration,"

"property of a defendant may be attached prior to the entry of judgment."
