"misdescription;  however,  the  Courtâ€™s  jurisdiction  has  otherwise  been"
"properly invoked. The Civil Appellate Court was indeed articulating the"
"trite proposition that even if a wrong provision has been inserted in the"
"caption but the Court has otherwise jurisdiction, the court can proceed"
"to exercise that jurisdiction. In my view, the civil appellate Court asked"
"itself the wrong question. This is not a question whether the Court has"
"jurisdiction or not. The proper question to pose is whether the LOLC"
"can present a petition in a case otherwise than in the main case. The"
"answer  lies  not  only  in  Section  15  (5)  of  the  Debt  Recovery  (Special"
"Provisions) Act No 2 of 1990, but also in Section 241 of the CPC."
