"Such relief is warranted only in exceptional circumstances: where the"
"court is satisfied that the plaintiff has established a strong prima facie"
"case, and where there is reason to believe that the defendant may act"
"in a manner calculated to defeat the satisfaction of any decree that may"
"ultimately  be  entered  against  him.  The  Civil  Procedure  Code  thus"
"requires the Plaintiff to establish a sufficient cause of action.2"
