Janak De Silva, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant (Appellant) instituted this action to partition the corpus

described in the schedule to the plaint. There was no dispute as to the identity of the

corpus.

According to the Appellant, Davith Pinto was at one time the owner of the corpus. He was

married to Nonchi Hamy and had five children named Marthelis, Abilinu Pinto, Juliana,

Mango and Engo.

The dispute between the Appellant and the Defendant-Respondent-Respondents

(Respondents) is on whether Juliana had four or six children. According to the Appellant,

she had six namely Agonis, Julius, Peso Hamy, Issan Appu, Elo Hamy and Agostinu. The

Respondents claim that Julina had only four children namely Julius, Peso Hamy, Agostinu

and Elo Hamy.

The learned trial judge concluded that Juliana had only four children, namely Julius, Peso

Hamy, Agostinu and Elo Hamy and entered judgment accordingly.

The Appellant failed to appeal against this judgment. Instead they filed a revision

application in the Provincial High Court of the Western Province (Civil Appellate) holden

at Gampaha (High Court). The Appellants contended that the discrepancy in the shares

allotted to the Respondents has caused grave prejudice to them.

The Respondents countered that having failed to file an appeal against the judgment of

the District Court, the Appellants are not entitled to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

the High Court.

The High Court concluded that there were no exceptional circumstances which requires

the Court to exercise its powers of revision and dismissed the application.

Leave to appeal has been granted on the following questions of law:

(1) Did the learned High Court Judges err in not appreciating that exceptional

circumstances do exist in the revision application where the learned Additional

District Judge has failed to investigate into title and arrive at a correct finding in

respect of the 1st Plaintiffs share and thereby satisfy the duty cast on the Court in

terms of Section 25(1) of the Partition Law?

(2) Did the learned High Court Judges err in not appreciating that when the learned

Additional District Judge has left a substantial share un-allotted to any party, when

in fact the 1st Plaintiff is entitled to the said un-allotted in view of the rights

emanating from the maternal inheritance of Juliana, that itself is a serious

miscarriage of justice?

(3) Did the learned High Court Judges err in not appreciating that when the learned

Additional District Judge has erred in allocating only 692/1600 shares to the 1st

Plaintiff when in fact she should have been allocated a much larger share, that itself

is a serious miscarriage of justice?

Only the 1st Appellant testified at the trial. She testified that Juliana had six children

namely Agonis, Julius, Peso Hamy, Issan Appu, Elo Hamy and Agostinu.

However, the learned trial judge considered the contents of deed No. 1337 which was

executed by Agostinu in 1957. According to this deed, Agostinu transferred the balance

1/8 share he had subsequent to the execution of deed No. 366 and his maternal

inheritance of 1/16th share from Juliana to Nelo Nona who then became entitled to a total

of 3/16 shares of the corpus. Earlier, Agostinu had by deed No. 366, transferred share

of share (1/8 share) to Piyadasa, who is the predecessor in title of the Respondents. It

is on this basis that the learned trial judge concluded that Julina had only four children by

the names Julius, Peso Hamy, Agostinu and Elo Hamy.

Page 8 of 9

The Respondents submitted that the share of 3/16 mentioned in deed No. 1337 can be

arrived at only if Julina had four children.

In P.M. Cooray v. M. A. P. Wijesuriya (62 NLR 158 at 161) Sinnetamby, J. held that other

than proof by the production of birth, death and marriage certificates, the relevant

provisions of the Evidence Ordinance in regard to proof of a pedigree are to be found in

Sections 32(5), 32(6) and 50(2). He went on to point out that what practitioners and the

Court sometimes lose sight of is the fact that before such evidence can be led there must

be proof that the hearsay evidence sought to be given is in respect of a statement made

by a person having special means of knowledge and that it must have been made ante

litem motam. Where the statement is made by a member of the family, such knowledge

may be inferred or even presumed, but where it is a statement made by an outsider, proof

of special means of knowledge must first be established.

The 1st Appellant testified that Issan Appu is her father. If so, she is a family member of

Juliana and can be presumed to have special means of knowledge of the number of

children Juliana had.

Nevertheless, deed No. 1337 executed by Agostinu, son of Juliana, has more probative

value to inferring the number of children Julina had as it had been executed ante litem

motam by a person who presumably had better knowledge than the 1st Appellant of the

number of his siblings. In these circumstances, the learned trial judge was correct in

placing more probative value on the content of deed No. 1337 and the inferences it

created.

Hence, I agree with the contention of the Respondents that the share of 3/16 mentioned

in deed No. 1337 can be arrived at only if Julina had four children.

Accordingly, I am of the view that the learned trail judge has properly investigated the title

to the corpus as required by Section 25 of the Partition Law.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer questions of law Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the negative.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
