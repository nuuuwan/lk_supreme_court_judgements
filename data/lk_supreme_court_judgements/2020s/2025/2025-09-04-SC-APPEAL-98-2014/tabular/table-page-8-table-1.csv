"The Respondents submitted that the share of 3/16 mentioned in deed No. 1337 can be"
"arrived at only if Julina had four children."
"In P.M. Cooray v. M. A. P. Wijesuriya (62 NLR 158 at 161) Sinnetamby, J. held that other"
"than  proof  by  the  production  of  birth,  death  and  marriage  certificates,  the  relevant"
"provisions of the Evidence Ordinance in regard to proof of a pedigree are to be found in"
"Sections 32(5), 32(6) and 50(2). He went on to point out that what practitioners and the"
"Court sometimes lose sight of is the fact that before such evidence can be led there must"
"be proof that the hearsay evidence sought to be given is in respect of a statement made"
"by a person having special means of knowledge and that it must have been made ante"
"litem motam. Where the statement is made by a member of the family, such knowledge"
"may be inferred or even presumed, but where it is a statement made by an outsider, proof"
"of special means of knowledge must first be established."
"The 1st Appellant testified that Issan Appu is her father. If so, she is a family member of"
"Juliana  and  can  be  presumed  to  have  special  means  of  knowledge  of  the  number  of"
"children Juliana had."
"Nevertheless, deed No. 1337 executed by Agostinu, son of Juliana, has more probative"
"value to inferring the number of children Julina had as it had been executed ante litem"
"motam by a person who presumably had better knowledge than the 1st Appellant of the"
"number  of  his  siblings.  In  these  circumstances,  the  learned  trial  judge  was  correct  in"
"placing  more  probative  value  on  the  content  of  deed  No.  1337  and  the  inferences  it"
"created."
"Hence, I agree with the contention of the Respondents that the share of 3/16 mentioned"
"in deed No. 1337 can be arrived at only if Julina had four children."
