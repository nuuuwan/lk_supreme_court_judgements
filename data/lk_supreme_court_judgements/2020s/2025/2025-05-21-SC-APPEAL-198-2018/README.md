THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. This appeal arises out of an action filed by the Ceylon Bank Employees Union (Applicant-

Respondent-Appellant), against the Peoples Bank (Respondent-Appellant-Respondent,

hereinafter referred to as the Respondent Bank), on behalf of W.M. Wijeratne Banda (to

whom I shall hereinafter refer to as the Appellant for convenience), who was employed

by the Respondent Bank for a period of 35 years.

2. The Appellant joined the Bank on 02nd December 1965 and, at the time of his termination

on 12th January 2001, held the position of Grade II Senior Manager while serving as the

Manager of the Mahiyangana Branch. His employment was terminated on grounds of

misconduct, following a Domestic Inquiry conducted by the Bank.

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 18

3. The termination was preceded by a Branch Inspection carried out by the Chief Internal

Auditor of the Bank, covering the period from 24th March 1992 to 27th September 1995,

during which the Appellant was in charge of the Mahiyangana Branch. The said audit

revealed several financial irregularities, including the granting of loans without obtaining

necessary security, failure to comply with internal circular instructions, and the

mismanagement of overdraft facilities. Additionally, a Branch Handing Over Certificate,

compiled by the subsequent branch Manager, listed various instances of irregularities

that had taken place under the Appellants tenure, which the Employee had signed and

accepted.

4. Based on these findings, the Bank issued the charge sheet dated 13th December 1999,

containing six counts of misconduct, including the Appellants failure to obtain security

for loans, violation of circular instructions, and actions that resulted in financial losses to

the Bank. Following the Domestic Inquiry, the Appellant was found guilty on five out of

the six charges and was consequently dismissed from service on 12th January 2001.

5. Challenging his termination, the Appellant, through a Registered Trade Union, filed an

application in the Labour Tribunal, claiming that his dismissal was unfair and excessive.

He contended that he had maintained an unblemished service record for 35 years and

had even received commendations from the Bank prior to his termination. He further

argued that the alleged lapses were minor, and the punishment of dismissal was

disproportionate to the nature of the charges.

6. During the proceedings before the Labour Tribunal, the Respondent Bank called four

witnesses, namely, M.M. Samarasekera, the then Manager of the Mahiyangana Branch; T.

Newton, a retired Bank Manager; K.H. Premadasa, Acting Regional Manager of the Bank;

and M. Nihal Ratnayake, Manager Training of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. A witness

named S.B. Dodanwela, a former Manager, gave evidence on behalf of the Appellant;

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 18

however, he passed away before he could be cross-examined. As his testimony remained

incomplete, the Labour Tribunal was unable to take it into consideration.

7. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Labour Tribunal, by its order dated 29th April 2013,

found the Appellant guilty only on count one of the charge sheet. The Tribunal held that

the Respondent Bank had failed to establish the other five charges conclusively.

Consequently, the Tribunal ordered the Appellant be entitled to his pension and ordered

half the pension from the date of termination to the date of the order, namely, which

amounts for 12 years and 3 months, amounting to Rs. 2,064,431.98. Further, the tribunal

ordered from the date of this order the Appellant will be entitled to his full pension.

8. Aggrieved by the order of the Labour Tribunal, the Respondent Bank appealed to the

Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in Kurunegala (hereinafter

referred to as the High Court), seeking to set aside the Tribunals decision. The

Respondent Bank contended that the Tribunal had erred in its findings, particularly in

holding that the termination was excessive despite clear evidence of financial

mismanagement and misconduct. The Respondent Bank further argued that the Tribunal

had acted beyond its jurisdiction by awarding pension benefits, which the Appellant had

not specifically requested in his application.

9. Upon hearing the submissions of both parties, the High Court, by its judgment dated

16th December 2015, set aside the order of the Labour Tribunal. The High Court held that

the termination of the Appellant was just and equitable, given the seriousness of the

financial misconduct committed by him. The High Court further ruled that the Labour

Tribunal had erred in granting pension benefits, as an employee dismissed for

misconduct is not entitled to such relief. However, the High Court awarded the Appellant

a sum of Rs. 561,744 as compensation, being half his salary for a period of three years

from the date of termination.

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 18

10. Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the Appellant filed the instant appeal to

the Supreme Court, challenging the decision. Leave was granted by this Court on the

following Questions of Law raised by the Appellant:

I. Whether the learned High Court Judge delivered a judgment that is inconsistent

with the legal and factual issues that arose for consideration in this case.

II. Whether the learned High Court Judge erred in concluding that the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal had erred in determining that the Employee was

entitled to his pension, given the circumstances of the case.

III. Whether the learned High Court Judges decision to award a compensation to the

Employee, half the salary that was payable to the Employee for a period of three

years is arbitrary and not supported on any rational basis.

11. I shall begin with the first question of law. In considering this question as to whether the

learned High Court Judge delivered a judgment that is inconsistent with the legal and

factual issues that arose for consideration in this case, I will consider the charges brought

against the Appellant by the Respondent Bank. The charges are as follows:

I. Granting of loans without obtaining the necessary security documents and/or

obtaining securities with defects, releasing money without approving the

securities, and acting negligently in awarding loans to five clients, resulting in an

unsecured loan amount of Rs. 1,360,560/- and exposing the Bank to financial risk.

II. Granting of Pledge of Paddy Loans without following loan approval instructions

and circular instructions, thereby relinquishing double control, stock control, and

failing to conduct proper investigations before releasing loan installments.

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 18

III. Granting and/or recommending temporary overdrafts in disregard of the

responsibility to safeguard Bank funds, resulting in non-payment of Rs.

7,046,356.33 as at 30/11/1999.

IV. Aiding and abetting the misappropriation of Bank funds by issuing a letter to an

insurance company expressing no objection to the payment of Rs. 1,859,195/- to

an individual named Gunawardena, in relation to the loss of paddy stock due to

fire, without following proper procedure.

V. Acting in a manner that caused the Bank to lose trust and confidence in the

Employee.

VI. Causing harm to the goodwill and reputation of the Bank.

12. With regard to the first charge, it is undisputed that the Appellant, in his capacity as the

Branch Manager of the Mahiyangana branch, granted a total sum of Rs. 1,360,560/- as

loans to five clients without obtaining the required security or by securing defective

guarantees. This conduct was in clear violation of Managers Circular No. 390/84, which

explicitly states that obtaining the necessary securities is the sole and personal

responsibility of the Branch Manager. The circular further warns that failure to comply

with this directive would result in severe disciplinary action.

13. The subsequent Branch Manager, in his testimony, confirmed that the Appellant had

released loan funds to several clients without the required securities, as evidenced in the

Branch Handing Over Certificate. One such instance involved a loan of Rs. 250,000/-

granted to H.A. Siriwardena for the purchase of a tractor.

14. The documentary evidence establishes that although this sum was released from the

Mahiyangana Branch, there was no security retained in favour of the Respondent Bank.

Moreover, the Form of Certificate of Registration of the tractor does not indicate that it

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 18

was registered under the Respondent Banks name. The Appellant has failed to produce

any evidence to demonstrate that the necessary securities were obtained.

15. This pattern of misconduct was not limited to a single instance. The evidence reveals that

the Appellant also granted loans to Pathahulla, Samarathunga, and Wijekoon in violation

of Circular No. 390/84. The Loan Approval Forms signed by the Regional Manager

specifically listed the securities that were to be obtained before the release of funds.

However, the Appellant, in flagrant disregard of his responsibilities, proceeded to release

the loan funds without ensuring compliance with the stipulated conditions.

16. Tilakawardane J., in D L K Peiris v. Celltell Lanka Limited 1 providing a definitive

explanation of what amounts to misconduct observed,

"Dismissal on the basis of misconduct is, after all, the foremost punishment in

labour law. In All Ceylon Oil Companies Workers' Union v. Standard Vacuum

Oil Cl.ID 237 CGG 12034 8.1.60 the Court defined misconduct as an act

which is inconsistent with the fulfillment of express or implied conditions of

service or which has a material bearing on the smooth and efficient working

of the concern.."

17. This definition does not limit misconduct to intentional wrongdoing but extends to

negligence and omissions that disrupt the employers operations. The Court of Appeal,

in Engineering Employees Union v. State Engineering Corporation,2 further clarified

that for an act or omission to constitute misconduct warranting disciplinary action, it

must:

I. Be inconsistent with the fulfilment of an express or implied condition of service;

1 SC Appeal No. 30/2009, SC Minutes of 11th March 2011, at p. 7

2 CA 862/85, CA Minutes of 02nd August 1991

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 18

II. Be directly linked with the general relationship of employer and employee;

III. Have a direct connection with the contentment and comfort of employees and

their work; and

IV. Have a material bearing on the smooth and efficient working of the concern.

18. The facts of the present case squarely fall within this definition. The Appellants failure to

obtain proper security for loans was a clear breach of an express condition of service, as

stated in Circular No. 390/84. This directly impacted the financial stability of the

institution, exposing it to significant risks and affecting its smooth functioning. Therefore,

the Respondent Bank was well within its rights to initiate disciplinary action.

19. Furthermore, the financial loss resulting from the Appellants misconduct is not merely

speculative. The succeeding Branch Manager testified that due to the lack of proper

documentation, the Bank suffered a loss of Rs. 1,737,000/-, with recovery proceedings

being hindered by the Appellants failure to obtain adequate securities. I find this to be

reinforcing the seriousness of the negligence in question.

20. In S.R. De Silvas Monograph on the Law of Dismissal, 3 it is stated that

incompetence, though not amounting to misconduct, is a good ground for dismissal.

21. Furthermore, this position is supported by several authorities, including The Electricity

Equipment & Construction Company v. Cooray4 and Reckitt & Colman Ltd. v. Peiris,5

where it was held that, as a general rule, refusal to comply with reasonable orders justifies

dismissal from service.

3 S.R. De Silva, Law of Dismissal (3rd edn, The Employers Federation of Ceylon: Monograph No. 8,

2018) at p. 32

4 (1962) 63 NLR 164

5 (1978) 79 (2) NLR 229

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 18

22. Applying this principle to the present case, the Appellants failure to comply with the

Banks circulars and directives, particularly in granting loans without proper security,

constitutes a serious violation of Banking procedures. This was not a minor lapse but a

direct breach of duty that exposed the Bank to significant financial risk, justifying his

dismissal.

23. In Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. v. Ram Naresh Kumar,6 the Supreme Court of India

held that where an employees dereliction of duty was found to be unsatisfactory, the

employer was within its rights to terminate the employees services. Similarly, in Clouston

& Co. v. Corry,7 the Court held that:

"Misconduct inconsistent with the fulfillment of the express or implied

conditions of service will justify termination."

24. The Appellant has sought to argue that his failure to comply with circular instructions

was not an act of misconduct but rather a necessary practice encouraged by the Bank to

facilitate efficient loan disbursement.

25. However, upon a careful examination of the Domestic Inquiry proceedings, the Labour

Tribunal order, and the High Court Judgment, it is evident that this justification is entirely

without merit. While it is undisputed that Bank Managers are expected to ensure

efficiency in loan approvals, such efficiency must always be exercised within the

framework of legal and procedural safeguards. There is no evidence before this Court to

support the assertion that the Bank had officially directed or permitted its Branch

Managers to disregard circular instructions when granting loans. The mere necessity to

6 1961 (1) LLJ 511

7 1906 AC 122, at p. 129

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 18

act efficiently does not absolve a Manager from the duty to ensure compliance with the

Banks regulations.

26. In view of the overwhelming evidence before this Court, it is evident that the decision of

the High Court to set aside the order of the Labour Tribunal is correct in law. The

Employees actions amount to serious misconduct, warranting dismissal. Given the clear

directives outlined in Managers Circular No. 390/84, the significant financial loss incurred

by the Employer Bank, and the established legal principles governing employment

discipline, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the decision of the High Court.

27. The charges against the Appellant, particularly charges 2 and 3, have been examined in

light of the evidence presented. Charge 2 involves the Appellant's action in granting

Pledge of Paddy Loans without following the necessary loan approval instructions and

circular guidelines. This includes failing to properly secure the paddy stocks and not

conducting necessary investigations when releasing loan instalments.

28. The Appellant was expected to ensure that the paddy loans were adequately protected,

but it was found that some stores, which were meant to contain grain as security for

loans, were empty, and the branch did not have control over the keys to the stocks. The

Appellant contended that the Branch Manager was not responsible for these loans, but

the evidence showed otherwise, indicating that the Appellant had a responsibility to

follow the required guidelines. The failure to adhere to these procedures potentially

posed a risk to the Bank's financial resources.

29. Charge 3 is with regard to the granting of temporary overdrafts (TODs) by the Appellant

without safeguarding the Banks funds, which resulted in an outstanding balance of Rs.

7,046,356.33. The Appellant granted overdrafts without assessing the customers ability

to repay, contrary to instructions specified in the Respondent Banks circular. Evidence

revealed that a significant proportion of these overdrafts remained unrecovered, raising

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 18

concerns about the lack of security and proper documentation for these loans. The

Appellant was expected to ensure that only eligible customers received overdrafts, and

that necessary precautions were taken to safeguard the Respondent Banks funds. The

fact that a portion of these overdrafts were granted after the Employee handed over the

branch to a new Manager was also noted, but it does not address the overdrafts granted

during the Employee's management.

30. Charges 5 and 6 are related to the Appellants conduct and the resulting harm to the

Banks trust, reputation, and credibility. These charges stem from the actions in charges

1 to 3, which suggest a breach of the Appellants duties as a Bank Manager. As an

employee of the Bank, the individual was expected to uphold the standards of integrity

and trustworthiness. The misconduct associated with failing to follow established

guidelines and granting loans without adequate safeguards led to significant risks for the

Banks financial standing.

31. However, after reviewing the evidence and the findings of the learned President of the

Labour Tribunal and the learned High Court Judge, this Court does not find it necessary

to consider the Appellants guilt on each individual charge. The Employee's actions in

charge 1 alone are sufficient ground for the termination of his employment.

32. Accordingly, in light of the above discussion, I answer the first Question of Law in the

affirmative.

33. I will now deal with the second Question of Law as to whether the learned High Court

Judge erred in concluding that the learned President of the Labour Tribunal had erred in

determining that the Appellant was entitled to his pension.

34. The Appellant, in his arguments before this Court, primarily contended that the Provincial

High Court erred in setting aside the Labour Tribunals order, which had granted him

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 18

pension rights. The Appellant stated that he was 56 years old at the time of his

termination and, therefore, eligible for a pension. However, upon a thorough

examination of the case record, particularly pages 262, 391, and 409 of the Brief, it is

evident beyond doubt that the Appellant was, in fact, 54 years old at the time of his

termination.

35. This finding is crucial given that, under the applicable Pension Fund Rules, pension

entitlement is strictly contingent upon the Appellant reaching the age of 55 while still in

service. The Labour Tribunal, in granting pension benefits to the Appellant, overlooked

this fundamental requirement and erroneously awarded pension benefits from the date

of termination rather than from the date he would have reached the retirement age,

which is wholly inconsistent with the governing rules.

36. When this factual inconsistency was raised during proceedings, the Appellant sought to

argue that the age recorded in the case documents was incorrectly reflected and was

mentioned only in the section containing the affirmation. However, I am not inclined to

entertain such an application at this stage.

37. If a case record contains an error regarding material particulars such as name, age, or

any other fundamental fact, such an error must be rectified at the earliest opportunity

during trial. The Appellant, having failed to challenge the accuracy of his recorded age at

the appropriate stage, cannot now discredit the information consistently reflected in

multiple entries across the case record.

38. Notably, when the Appellant commenced giving evidence before the Tribunal in or about

January 2008, he was recorded as being 61 years old. By 2010, he was 64 years old, and

in 2011, he was 65 years old. A simple mathematical calculation confirms that at the time

of his termination in 2001, he could not have been 56 years old, as he claimed, but was

in fact only 54 years old. This Court finds that there is no material to find that he had met

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 18

the minimum eligibility requirements under the Pension Fund Rules and was thus not

entitled to a pension.

39. Priyasath Dep, PC, J (as His Lordship was then) in Peoples Bank v. Ariyapala 8

recognized that a Labour Tribunal has the discretion to consider all relevant facts brought

before it during the inquiry, even if those facts were not expressly pleaded in the original

application. It was specifically stated that;

It is appropriate at this stage to draw a distinction between a plaint in a civil

case and an application in the Labour Tribunal. Civil cases are regulated by

the Civil Procedure Code and has provisions regarding contents/requisites of

plaint, answer and replication and provisions to amend pleadings. It is settled

law that in civil cases the Court could not grant relief not prayed for. In case

of Labour Tribunals there is no procedure prescribed and the Tribunal has the

power to adopt a suitable procedure. Therefore Labour Tribunal is not fettered

by stringent and a rigid procedure as in a civil cases.

40. This principle underscores the Tribunals broad discretion in ensuring that justice is

served in employment disputes, without being constrained by the formalities applicable

to civil litigation. Consequently, a party may seek relief during the inquiry stage, even if

such relief was not explicitly sought in the initial application, provided that it falls within

the just and equitable jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

41. However, while the flexibility of Labour Tribunal proceedings allows for the consideration

of unpleaded relief, this discretion is not absolute. In the present case, the issue is not

merely one of procedural latitude but of substantive legal ineligibility. The Appellant,

having been terminated at the age of 54, did not meet the age requirement of 55 years

as stipulated under the applicable Pension Fund Rules. The pension scheme in question

8 SC Appeal No. 33/2012, SC Minutes of 10th December 2014, at p. 8

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 18

does not provide for pension entitlement to employees who leave service before

reaching the qualifying age, except in limited circumstances upon medical

recommendation and approval by the General Manager.

42. In these circumstances, I find that the order of the Labour Tribunal granting pension

rights to the Appellant was legally unsustainable and was correctly set aside on appeal.

This Court finds the Appellant not entitled to pension rights.

43. I find that the Appellant's claim for pension entitlement is untenable as he did not meet

the required age criteria under the Pension Fund Rules. Accordingly, the second Question

of Law, too, is answered in the affirmative.

44. I shall now advert to the third and final Question of Law, as to whether the learned High

Court Judges decision to award compensation to the Appellant half the salary that was

payable to him for a period of three years, is arbitrary and not supported on any rational

basis.

45. At the outset, this Court deems it necessary to emphasise that the issue under

consideration is not merely whether the quantum of compensation was arbitrary, but

rather if the Appellant was entitled to any compensation at all.

46. Compensation in cases of termination is awarded under Section 31B(1) of the Industrial

Disputes Act, which provides relief to an employee where the termination of service is

found to be unjust, or where there exists a basis for awarding benefits due upon

termination. However, it is imperative to consider whether such relief extends to an

employee whose own conduct has contributed to his dismissal.

47. The jurisprudence governing termination of employment recognises that an employer

retains the right to dismiss an employee for just cause, particularly where the employees

conduct is blameworthy, unreasonable, or in direct violation of his contractual

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 18

obligations. This principle was reaffirmed in Kotagala Plantations v. Ranasinghe, 9

where it was held that the employer had established genuine reasons for termination

and the employees misconduct was intentional and deliberate, leaving him with no one

to blame but himself.

48. In the present case, the evidence placed before this Court overwhelmingly establishes

that the Appellant was dismissed due to mismanagement of Bank funds and failure to

adhere to mandatory Banking procedures. The charges against him disclose a pattern of

irresponsible conduct that exposed the employer to substantial financial risk.

49. Moreover, this Court takes note that the Appellant held a position of trust as a Branch

Manager, where he was entrusted with the duty of ensuring financial prudence in loan

disbursement and fund management. Instead, the Appellant granted unsecured loans,

facilitated the misappropriation of funds, and failed to comply with clear Banking

regulations, thereby compromising the financial integrity of the Respondent Bank.

50. The principle that an employee who is responsible for his own dismissal should not be

entitled to compensation is not only well-founded in Sri Lankan jurisprudence but also

supported by legal principles in comparative jurisdictions.

51. In Morrison v. Amalgamated TGWU,10 the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal held that:

"Where an employees conduct has contributed to his dismissal and is culpable,

blameworthy, or unreasonable, compensation may be reduced or entirely

denied."

9 SC Appeal No. 54/2010, SC Minutes of 03rd February 2012, at p. 7

10 [1989] IRLR 361

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 18

52. This Court has taken a similar stance in The Caledonian (Ceylon) Tea and Rubber

Estates Limited v. Hillman,11 where Sharvananda J. observed:

If the employees conduct had induced the termination, he cannot, in justice

and equity, have a just claim to compensation for loss of career as he has only

himself to blame for the predicament in which he finds himself

53. This Court is of the firm view that these principles are directly applicable to the present

case. The Appellant, by his own reckless and irresponsible conduct, has not only breached

the trust placed in him but also caused substantial financial losses to the Bank. It is neither

just nor equitable to require the employer to compensate an employee whose own

actions have directly led to his dismissal.

54. It is therefore the view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge erred in law by

awarding compensation to the Appellant without any proper legal justification. The

principle of equity must operate bilaterally, ensuring that employers are not unfairly

burdened by compensating employees whose own wrongful acts have led to their

dismissal.

55. In light of the above, the third Question of Law is also answered in the negative.

CONCLUSION

56. Upon a careful consideration of all the material before this Court, I find the Labour

Tribunals finding of guilt against the Appellant on the first charge to be justified. The

conclusion reached by the High Court that the Appellant was guilty not only of the first

charge but also of the third, fifth and sixth charges is equally justifiable. Accordingly, I

affirm the findings of the High Court on the issue of misconduct.

11 79 (1) NLR 421, at pp. 429-430

SC Appeal 198/18 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 18

57. The order made by the President of the Labour Tribunal awarding pension benefits to

the Appellant is untenable, as the learned High Court Judge has rightfully concluded.

Therefore, I affirm the conclusion of the High Court in setting aside the order of the

Labour Tribunal with respect to the Appellants entitlement to pension benefits.

58. At the same time, the High Courts decision to award compensation presumably on

sympathetic grounds is likewise without merit. Accordingly, the order of the High Court

with respect to the payment of compensation is set aside.

59. For the sake of completeness, I reiterate that the Appellant is guilty of misconduct and

that his termination is justified. The Appellant shall not be entitled to any compensation.

60. Subject to the above variations, the appeal is dismissed. Parties shall bear their own costs.

Appeal Dismissed.
