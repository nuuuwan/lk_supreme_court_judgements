"3.","The termination was preceded by a Branch Inspection carried out by the Chief Internal"
"","Auditor of the Bank, covering the period from 24th March 1992 to 27th September 1995,"
"","during which the Appellant was in charge of the Mahiyangana Branch. The said audit"
"","revealed several financial irregularities, including the granting of loans without obtaining"
"","necessary 
security, 
failure 
to  comply  with 
internal  circular 
instructions,  and 
the"
"","mismanagement of overdraft facilities.  Additionally, a Branch Handing Over Certificate,"
"","compiled by the subsequent branch Manager, listed various instances of irregularities"
"","that had taken place under the Appellant’s tenure, which the Employee had signed and"
"","accepted."
"4.","Based  on these findings, the Bank issued the charge sheet dated 13th  December 1999,"
"","containing six counts of misconduct, including the Appellant’s failure to obtain security"
"","for loans, violation of circular instructions, and actions that resulted in financial losses to"
"","the Bank. Following the Domestic Inquiry, the Appellant was found guilty on five out of"
"","the six charges and was consequently dismissed from service on 12th January 2001."
"5.","Challenging his termination, the Appellant, through a Registered Trade Union, filed an"
"","application in the Labour Tribunal, claiming that his dismissal was unfair and excessive."
"","He contended that he had maintained an unblemished service record for 35 years  and"
"","had  even  received  commendations from  the  Bank  prior  to  his  termination.  He further"
"","argued  that  the  alleged 
lapses  were  minor,  and  the  punishment  of  dismissal  was"
"","disproportionate to the nature of the charges."
"6.","During  the  proceedings  before  the  Labour Tribunal,  the  Respondent Bank  called four"
"","witnesses, namely, M.M. Samarasekera, the then Manager of the Mahiyangana Branch; T."
"","Newton, a retired Bank Manager; K.H. Premadasa, Acting Regional Manager of the Bank;"
"","and M. Nihal Ratnayake, Manager Training of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. A witness"
"","named  S.B.  Dodanwela,  a former  Manager,  gave evidence  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant;"
