"","however, he passed away before he could be cross-examined. As his testimony remained"
"","incomplete, the Labour Tribunal was unable to take it into consideration."
"7.","At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Labour Tribunal, by its order dated 29 th April 2013,"
"","found the Appellant guilty only on count one of the charge sheet. The Tribunal held that"
"","the  Respondent  Bank  had  failed 
to  establish 
the  other  five  charges  conclusively."
"","Consequently, the Tribunal ordered the Appellant be entitled to his pension and ordered"
"","half the pension from the date of termination to the date of the order, namely, which"
"","amounts for 12 years and 3 months, amounting to Rs. 2,064,431.98. Further, the tribunal"
"","ordered from the date of this order the Appellant will be entitled to his full pension."
"8.","Aggrieved  by the order of the Labour Tribunal, the Respondent Bank appealed to the"
"","Provincial  High  Court  of  North  Western  Province  holden  in  Kurunegala  (hereinafter"
"","referred  to  as  the  “High  Court”),  seeking  to  set  aside  the  Tribunal’s  decision.  The"
"","Respondent Bank contended that the Tribunal had erred in  its findings, particularly in"
"","holding 
that 
the 
termination  was  excessive  despite 
clear  evidence  of 
financial"
"","mismanagement and misconduct. The Respondent Bank further argued that the Tribunal"
"","had acted beyond its jurisdiction by awarding pension benefits, which the Appellant had"
"","not specifically requested in his application."
"9.","Upon hearing the submissions of both parties, the High Court, by its judgment dated"
"","16th December 2015, set aside the order of the Labour Tribunal. The High Court held that"
"","the  termination  of  the  Appellant  was  just  and  equitable,  given  the  seriousness  of  the"
"","financial misconduct committed by him. The High Court further ruled that the Labour"
"","Tribunal  had  erred 
in  granting  pension  benefits,  as  an  employee  dismissed 
for"
"","misconduct is not entitled to such relief. However, the High Court awarded the Appellant"
"","a sum of Rs. 561,744 as compensation, being half his salary for a period of three years"
"","from the date of termination."
