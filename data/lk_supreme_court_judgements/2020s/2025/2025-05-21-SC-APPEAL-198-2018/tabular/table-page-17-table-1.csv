"52.  This  Court  has  taken  a  similar  stance  in  The  Caledonian  (Ceylon)  Tea  and  Rubber",""
"","Estates Limited v. Hillman,11 where Sharvananda J. observed:"
"","“…If the employee’s conduct had induced the termination, he cannot, in justice"
"","and equity, have a just claim to compensation for loss of career as he has only"
"","himself to blame for the predicament in which he finds himself…”"
"53.  This Court is of the firm view that these principles are directly applicable to the present",""
"","case. The Appellant, by his own reckless and irresponsible conduct, has not only breached"
"","the trust placed in him but also caused substantial financial losses to the Bank. It is neither"
"","just  nor  equitable  to  require  the  employer  to  compensate  an  employee  whose  own"
"","actions have directly led to his dismissal."
"54.","It is therefore the view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge erred in law by"
"","awarding  compensation  to  the  Appellant  without  any  proper  legal  justification.  The"
"","principle  of  equity  must  operate  bilaterally,  ensuring  that  employers  are  not  unfairly"
"","burdened  by  compensating  employees  whose  own  wrongful  acts  have  led  to  their"
"","dismissal."
"55.","In light of the above, the third Question of Law is also answered in the negative."
"","CONCLUSION"
"56.  Upon  a  careful  consideration  of  all  the  material  before  this  Court,  I  find  the  Labour",""
"","Tribunal’s finding of guilt against the Appellant on the first charge  to be  justified.  The"
"","conclusion reached by the High Court that the Appellant was guilty not only of the first"
"","charge but  also of the  third, fifth  and sixth charges  is equally  justifiable.  Accordingly, I"
"","affirm the findings of the High Court on the issue of misconduct."
