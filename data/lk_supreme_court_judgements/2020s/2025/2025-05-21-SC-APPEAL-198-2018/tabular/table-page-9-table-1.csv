"","IV. Have a material bearing on the smooth and efficient working of the concern."
"18.  The facts of the present case squarely fall within this definition. The Appellant’s failure to",""
"","obtain proper security for loans was a clear breach of an express condition of service, as"
"","stated 
in  Circular  No.  390/84.  This  directly 
impacted  the  financial  stability  of  the"
"","institution, exposing it to significant risks and affecting its smooth functioning. Therefore,"
"","the Respondent Bank was well within its rights to initiate disciplinary action."
"19.  Furthermore, the financial loss resulting from the Appellant’s misconduct is not merely",""
"","speculative.  The  succeeding  Branch  Manager  testified  that  due  to  the  lack  of  proper"
"","documentation, the Bank suffered a loss of Rs. 1,737,000/-, with recovery proceedings"
"","being hindered by the Appellant’s failure to obtain adequate securities. I find this to be"
"","reinforcing the seriousness of the negligence in question."

the  Law  of  Dismissal,

is 
stated 
that"
"","“incompetence, though not amounting to misconduct, is a good ground for dismissal.”"

"","where it was held that, as a general rule, refusal to comply with reasonable orders justifies"
"","dismissal from service."
