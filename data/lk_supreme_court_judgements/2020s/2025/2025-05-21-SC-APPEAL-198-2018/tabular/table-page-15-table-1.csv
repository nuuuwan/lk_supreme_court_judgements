"","This Court finds the Appellant not entitled to pension rights."
"43.","I find that the Appellant's claim for pension entitlement is untenable as he did not meet"
"","the required age criteria under the Pension Fund Rules. Accordingly, the second Question"
"","of Law, too, is answered in the affirmative."
"44.","I shall now advert to the third and final Question of Law, as to whether the learned High"
"","Court Judgeâ€™s decision to award compensation to the Appellant half the salary that was"
"","payable to him for a period of three years, is arbitrary and not supported on any rational"
