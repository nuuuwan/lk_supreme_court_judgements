"2nd Accused – Respondent – Respondent to plead ‘guilty’ and thereby secure"
"a conviction against him. That was for the purpose of subverting the course"
"of criminal justice and to mislead the Magistrate’s Court, and thereby shield"
"the Appellant from the criminal justice response and sanctions arising out"
"his having driven the jeep at the time of the accident and for having caused"
"the accident. It was a part of that ‘plan’, to get the 2nd Accused – Respondent"
"– Respondent to plead ‘guilty’ for an offence he did not commit. If that case"
"theory  is  correct  (which  the  prosecution  would  have  to  prove  beyond"
"reasonable doubt through evidence and other tools available for the proof"
"of facts), the conviction of the 2nd Accused – Respondent – Respondent had"
"been obtained through fraud perpetrated on the Magistrate’s Court for the"
"purpose of subverting the course of criminal justice. If that is established,"
"the purported ‘conviction’ of the 2nd Accused – Respondent – Respondent"
"imposed by the learned Magistrate would be valueless. ‘Crimen omnia ex se"
"nata vitiat’ – Crime taints everything that springs from it. Thus, not even a"
"finding  clothed  in  a  verdict  imposed  by  a  judge  would  have  any  value,"
"sanctity or recognition in the eyes of the law, if it had been obtained through"
"perpetration of fraud. As held in the unanimous opinion of the judges of the"
"House of Lords in the Duchess of Kingston ‘s Case [1775-1802] All ER Rep.,"
"“fraud is an extrinsic, collateral act, which vitiates the most solemn proceedings of"
"courts of justice”. Thus, purported judicial findings, verdicts and orders shall"
"be void and have no force in law, upon it being established that they had"
"been obtained through fraud. In any event, it is well accepted in common"
"law that,  let alone  an  issue estoppel,  even an estoppel  simplicitor cannot be"
"founded  upon  fraud.  That  would  be  an  additional  reason  for  the  non-"
"applicability of the doctrine of issue estoppel to the instant case. However, I"
"must  emphasise  that  it  would  be  the  duty  of  the  prosecutor  to  establish"
"before  the  High  Court  that  a  fraud  (in  the  nature  of  a  subversion  of  the"
"course of criminal justice) had been perpetrated by the three accused before"
"the Magistrate’s Court."
