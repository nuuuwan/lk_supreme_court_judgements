"9) Chief Justice H.H. Basnayake presiding over the Court of Criminal Appeal"
"with whom Justice H.N.G. Fernando and Justice L.W. de Silva expressing"
"agreement, observed the following:"
"“The maxim cited (a reference to ‘res judicata pro veritate accipitur’) in the"
"reasons of the Board delivered by Lord MacDermott is one that has not been"
"applied before in a criminal case in this country, nor are we aware of any case"
"in which it has been applied in criminal proceedings in England. But, that is no"
"reason why we should refrain from applying it in a suitable case. The instant"
"case is one such. The maxim is not in conflict with the provisions of our statute"
"law which govern criminal proceedings and has the merit of sound good sense"
"to commend its application to criminal proceedings. It is of Roman Law origin"
"(Digest L. Tit. XVII, S. 207) and is well known to both the Roman Dutch (Voet"
"Bk XLII, Tit. I, S. 29) and the Scots systems of Law (Stair – Moore’s Edn. Vol."
"II, S. 554; MacDonald on Criminal Law of Scotland, 5th Edn. pp. 272 - 273)"
"though instances of its application to criminal proceedings are rare. It will lead"
"to queer results if in a case such as that before us, the prosecution is not bound"
"to  accept  as  correct  so  much  of  the  verdict  at  the  previous  trial  as  remains"
"unreversed  and  is  permitted  to  challenge  it.  We  are  of  the  opinion  that  the"
"prosecution was bound to present its case on the basis that the unreversed part"
"of the verdict at the earlier trial was correct and it was not open to the learned"
