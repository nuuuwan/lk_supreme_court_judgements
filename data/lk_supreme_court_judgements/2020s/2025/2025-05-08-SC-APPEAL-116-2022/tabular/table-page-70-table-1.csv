"In the matters at hand, it is the Magistrate Courtâ€™s decision that is being"
"challenged  indirectly  in  the  High  Court.  What  will  be  the  outcome  in  a"
"converse  situation  when  a  court  in  an  upper  stratum  of  the  hierarchy"
"decides a matter and another decision by a lower court between some of"
"the parties who took part in the previous decision-making process, decides"
"that the decision of the upper court was taken by fraud committed on the"
"Court?"
"I think it may not set a good precedent to allow a parallel decision to make"
"previous  decision  invalidate  unless  it  is  done  through  a  procedure  laid"
"down by law. Such an approach may create ambiguity as to the rule of law."
"However,  a  collateral  attack  may  apply  to  a  judgment  which  is  void  ab"
"initio, such as a judgment given without Jurisdiction."
"Further Concerns"
"Certain  comments  made  by  my  brother  justice  may  give  the  impression"
"that a judicially determined decision comes only after a full-blown trial and"
"a conviction based on a plea of guilt is not a judicial finding. I admit that a"
"full-blown  trial  may  reveal  all  the  facts  and  circumstances  for  a  better-"
"informed decision. However, as I said before, a plea of guilt contains an"
"admission which is evidence unless barred by law itself. On the other hand,"
"it is only an unconditional plea of guilt that allows the Magistrate to convict"
"the accused. If the attendant circumstances indicate that the plea is not an"
"unconditional admission, the Magistrate should not entertain such a plea"
"of  guilt.  Thus,  in  my  view  a  conviction  on  a  plea  of  guilt  is  not  a  mere"
"ministerial act but a judicial decision."
"As stated by my brother Justice Kodagoda, Magistrate may not supervise"
"or direct the conduct of police investigation in a manner a senior officer of"
"the same department does, but it is the duty of the Magistrate to oversee"
"whether  the  due  process  of  law  is  in  place  during  an  investigation.  The"
"powers  to  be  present during  a  search  to  see  whether  it  is  duly  executed"
"(Section 79(1) of the Cri Pro. Code) and power to withdraw a  case from"
"inquirer  (Section  119  of  Cri.  Pro.  Code)  indicates  such  power.  Thus,  the"
"inquiry the Magistrate had before framing charges against the 2nd Accused-"
"Respondent, cannot be faulted. If the Magistrate could find some material"
"to establish the allegations, he could have made a suitable direction in that"
"regard."
