"Therefore,  I  doubt  that  whether  the  above  situation  could  give  rise  to  a"

"inference  of  guilt  to  the  charge  from  which  the  accused  was  acquitted"
"should not be allowed to be led in the subsequent trial, if the accused was"
"acquitted in the first trial on a charge based on the same incident or process."
