"should not be allowed to be led in the subsequent trial, if the accused was"
"acquitted in the first trial on a charge based on the same incident or process."
"Whatever it is, I also observe that a conjecture of guilt, that may arise due"
"to the subsequent trial with regard to a previous trial where the accused"
"was  acquitted,  is  different  from  inviting  the  court to  come  to  a  different"
"conclusion with regard to the acquittal made in the previous trial."
"Most of the cases referred to by my Brother Justice Kodagoda are cases that"
"disagree with the Sambasivam case by contemplating a rule that prohibit"
"calling  witnesses  again  in  the  subsequent  trial  when  the  accused  was"
"acquitted in the previous trial. Are those decisions sufficient to state that a"
"criminal court in a subsequent trial between the same parties on the same"
"incident on a different charge can come to a different finding on an already"
"decided specific fact in the previous case? For example, if a court found at"
"the  first  trial  that  A  is  guilty  of  negligent  driving,  it  gives  rise  to  two"
"different  conclusions,  namely,  A  was  the  driver  at  the  incident,  A  was"
"negligent in driving. Can a criminal court, in a 2nd trial between the same"
"parties on the same incident come to a conclusion that A was not the driver"
"against the specific finding in the previous case.  (a similar  situation was"
"considered  in  the  The  Queen  v.  Ariyawantha  with  regard  to  common"

"I  cannot  find  any  support  from  the  cases  cited  by  His  Lordship  Justice"
"Kodagoda  to  say  that  one  can  move  a  court  in  the  subsequent  action"
"between the same parties to find a different conclusion  with regard to a"
"specifically decided fact in the previous action."
"Would the Court, in any  of the cases referred to by  his Lordship  Justice"
"Kodagoda that came for the conclusion that witness of the previous case"
"which resulted in an acquittal could be led in the subsequent trial, come to"
"the  same  conclusion  if  there  was  a  specific  decision  regarding  the  said"
"witness that he or she lied to Court while giving evidence? If such a witness"
"is allowed to give evidence in the subsequent trial, the accused faces double"
"jeopardy as he may not get the same opportunities again to prove that the"
"witness is a liar since the witness is aware where he or she failed on  the"
"previous occasion."
