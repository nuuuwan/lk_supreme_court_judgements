"by Lord Devlin in Connelly vs. Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] 2 All"
"ER 401, in the following manner:"
"“Autrefois Acquit prevents the prosecution from impugning the validity of the"
"verdict  as  a  whole.  Issue  Estoppel  prevents  it  from  raising  again  any  of  the"
"several  issues  of  fact  which  the  jury  have  decided,  or  are  presumed  to  have"
"decided, in reaching their verdict in the accused’s favour.”"
"82) Commenting on the applicability of issue estoppel in criminal proceedings,"
"Coomaraswamy has said that “in criminal cases, issue estoppel in English law"
"has had a chequered career and in the present state of the law, it is not given"
"any  recognition  at  all  …  The  House  of  Lords  has  now  held  that  ‘issue"
"estoppel’ is inapplicable in English Criminal law”. (op. cit., pp. 553-554)"
