"subsequent  proceedings.  Secondly,  there  is  the  principle,  which  is  not  easily"
"described as a species of estoppel, that where the claimant succeeded in the first"
"action and does not challenge the outcome, he may not bring a second action on"
"the same cause of action, for example to recover further damages: see Conquer v"
"Boot  [1928] 2 KB 336.  Third,  there is  the doctrine  of  merger,  which  treats a"
"cause of action as extinguished once judgment has been given upon it, and the"
"claimant’s  sole  right  as  being  a  right  upon  the  judgment.  Although  this"
"produces the same effect as the second principle, it is in reality a substantive"
"rule about the legal effect of an English judgment, which is regarded as “of a"
"higher nature” and therefore as superseding the underlying cause of action: see"
"King v Hoare (1844) 13 M & W 494, 504 (Parke B). At common law, it did not"
"apply to foreign judgments, although every other principle of res judicata does."
"However, a corresponding rule has applied by statute to foreign judgments since"
"1982: see Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982, section 34. Fourth, there"
"is the principle that even where the cause of action is not the same in"
"the  later  action  as  it  was  in  the  earlier  one,  some  issue  which  is"
"necessarily common to both was decided on the earlier occasion and is"
"binding on the parties: Duchess of Kingston’s Case (1776) 20 St Tr 355."
"“Issue estoppel” was the expression devised to describe this principle by"
"Higgins J in Hoysted v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1921) 29 CLR"
"537, 561 and adopted by Diplock LJ in Thoday v Thoday [1964] P 181,"
"197-198. Fifth, there is the principle first formulated by Wigram V-C in"
"Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100, 115, which precludes a party"
"from  raising  in  subsequent  proceedings  matters  which  were  not,  but"
"could and should have been raised in the earlier ones. Finally, there is the"
"more  general  procedural  rule  against  abusive  proceedings,  which  may  be"
"regarded as the policy underlying all of the above principles with the possible"
"exception of the doctrine of merger.” [Emphasis added by me.]"
