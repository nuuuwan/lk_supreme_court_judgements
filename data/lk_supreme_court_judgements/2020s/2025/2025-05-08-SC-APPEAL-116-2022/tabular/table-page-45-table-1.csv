"116) 
Lord 
Justice  Hailsham  of  St.  Marylebone","initially 
expressed  his"
"","agreement with Lord Justice Diplock’s views in Mills vs. Cooper that if the"
"","doctrine  of  ‘issue  estoppel’  is  applicable  at  all  in  criminal  proceedings,  he"
"","noted that it must be taken for better or for worse, with all its manifestations."
"","He noted that, it has been settled as a matter of law that issue estoppel does"
"","not in general apply where the earlier judgment is impugned on the ground"
"","of  fraud.  Even  in  civil  proceedings,  the  doctrine  of  issue  estoppel  is  not  of"
"","universal application. Reasons of public policy may compel a court to look"
"behind 
the 
litigation  of  parties","to  discover  actual 
facts.  Lord 
Justice"
"Hailsham  concluded  that,  the  doctrine  of","issue  estoppel  as  it  has  been"
"","developed  in  civil  proceedings  is  not  applicable  in  criminal  proceedings."
"","Although the civil doctrine of issue estoppel as it has been developed is not"
"","applicable in criminal proceedings, there is a doctrine applicable to criminal"
"","proceedings  which  is  in  some  ways  analogous  to  issue  estoppel,  and  has"
"","sometimes been described by that name. The civil doctrine is based on the"
"","necessity  for  finality  between  private  litigants,  whereas  the  doctrine  in"
"","criminal proceedings is based on the prohibition against double jeopardy."
"","Further, the doctrine is available to the accused in criminal proceedings, but"
"","not to the Crown. In general, the doctrine of issue estoppel in criminal law"
"","precludes the Crown from adducing evidence or making suggestions which"
"","are inconsistent with a previous verdict of acquittal when its real effect is"
"determined.",""
