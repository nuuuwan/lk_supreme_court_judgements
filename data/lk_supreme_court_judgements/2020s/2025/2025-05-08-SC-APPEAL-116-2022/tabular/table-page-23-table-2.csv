"reported in [1980] 2 All ER 227, in the following manner:",""
"","“… the word ‘estoppel’ only means stopped. You will find it explained"
"","by Coke in his Commentaries on Littleton (at 352a). It was brought over"
"","by  the  Normans.  They  used  the  old  French  ‘estoupail’.  That  meant  a"
"","bunk or cork by which you stopped something from coming out. It was"
"","in common use in our courts when they carried on all their proceedings"
"","in Norman French. … From the simple origin there has been a built up"
"","over  the  centuries  in  our  law  a  big  house  with many  rooms.  It  is  the"
"","house  called  Estoppel.  In  Cork’s  time  it  was  a  small  house  with  only"
"","three rooms, namely estoppel by matter of record, by matter in writing,"
"","and by matter in ‘pais’. But by our time, we have so many rooms that"
"","we are apt to get confused between them. … These several rooms have"
"","this much in common: they are all under one roof. Someone is stopped"
"","from  saying  something  or  other,  or  doing  something  or  other,  or"
"","contesting something or other. But each room is used differently from"
"","the others. … Each room has its own separate notices. It is a mistake to"
"","suppose that what you find in one room, you will also find in the others.”"
