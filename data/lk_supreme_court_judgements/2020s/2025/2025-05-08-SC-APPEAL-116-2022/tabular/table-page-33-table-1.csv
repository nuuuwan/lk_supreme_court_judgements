"","facts  and  circumstances  of  each  case  and  the  respective  findings  of  the"
"","justices who decided those cases. The need to do so has arisen due to the"
"","factual and procedural contexts in which the law has been applied in those"
"cases  and  conclusions  reached.  However,","it  has  caused  considerable"
"","lengthening of this judgment, much against my wish. It may be noted that"
"","these  judgments  have  been  arranged  in  sequence  based  on  the  dates  on"
"","which they had been pronounced. These judgments have been pronounced"
"","between the years of 1950 and 2000. This has necessitated me to consider Sri"
"","Lankan and English law-based judgments in a conjoined manner and not"
"separately.",""
