"","I
t  is  the  2nd  Accused-Respondent  who  pleaded  guilty  to  the  charge"
"","before the Magistrate. Pleading guilty is an admission of the fact that he"
"","committed 
the  alleged  offence.  Admission 
is  evidence  unless 
its"
"","admissibility  is  barred  by  law  (for  eg:  confession  made  to  a  police"
"","officer). Based on that admission, the Magistrates had convicted the 2nd"
"","Accused – Respondent to the charge before the Magistrate. If it is a false"
"","admission, that guilty pleading, though it was not under oath, amounts"
"","to  placing 
false 
evidence  before 
the  Magistrate 
to  mislead 
the"
"","Magistrate.  Once  the  admission  of  guilt  is  made,  a  full  trial  is  not"

"2.","It  is  the  1st  Accused-Appellant  who  had  taken  the  position  that  issue"
"","estoppel applies. However, he was not a party in the Magistrates Court."
"","When the 2nd Accused-Respondent, who was the party to the previous"

"","do not think that the 1st Accused – Appellant should be allowed to object"
"","to the indictment as a privy to the 2nd Accused – Respondent when the"
"","2nd  Accused-Respondent  did  not  raise  the  objection  along  with  the"
"","Appellant  before  the  High  Court.  Perhaps,  that  would  have  been  a"
"","tactical  move  by  the  2nd  Accused  –  Respondent  to  raise  the  same"
"","objection 
in  due  course  when 
the  relevant  objectionable 
items  of"
"","evidence are to be led in evidence, since to object to the indictment, this"
"","is  not  a  situation  where  autrefois  acquit  and  autrefois  convict  applies"
"","due to different charges in the indictment."
"3.","It  appears  that  there  is  fresh  evidence  available  now.  In  R  v  Z  (Prior"
"","Acquittal) [2000] 2 A.C. 483. It is stated, “Alternatively, the evidence in the"
"","present case would come within the recognized exception to the doctrine when"
"","there is fresh evidence.”"
