"124)","Lord  Hutton  who  pronounced  the  principal  judgment  arrived  at  the"
"following findings:",""
"i.","The doctrine of double jeopardy operates to cause a criminal court in the"
"","exercise  of  its  discretion,  and  subject  to  the  qualification  as  to  special"
"","circumstances stated by Lord Devlin in Connelly, to stop a prosecution"
"","where 
the  defendant 
is  being  prosecuted  on 
the 
same 
facts  or"
"","substantially the same facts, so as to give rise to an earlier prosecution"
"","which resulted in his acquittal (or conviction)."
"ii.","Provided that a defendant is not placed in double jeopardy as described"
"","in (i) above, evidence which is relevant to a subsequent prosecution is"
"","not inadmissible because it shows or tends to show that the defendant"
"","was, in fact, guilty of an offence of which he had earlier been acquitted."
"iii.","It  follows  from  (ii)  above,  that  a  distinction  should  not  be  drawn"
"","between evidence which shows guilt of an earlier offence of which the"
"","defendant had been acquitted, and evidence which tends to show guilt"
"","of such an offence or which appears to relate to one distinct issue rather"
"","than to the issue of guilt of such an offence."
"iv.","In  the  present  case,  the  defendant  is  not  placed  in  double  jeopardy"
"","because the facts giving rise to the present prosecution are different to"
"","the facts which gave rise to the earlier prosecutions. The evidence of the"
"","earlier complainants is accepted to be relevant and to come within the"
"","ambit  of  the  similar  facts  rule,  and  therefore  it  is  not  inadmissible"
"","because it shows that the defendant was, in fact, guilty of the offences of"
"","rape of which he had earlier been acquitted."
"v.","The  evidence  relating  to  the  earlier  complaints  was  relevant,  came"
"","within  the  ambit  of  the  similar  facts  rule,  and  thus  was  not  rendered"
"","inadmissible simply because it showed that the defendant was, in fact,"
"","guilty of the offences of rape of which he had earlier been acquitted."
