"accused  before  that  court),  on  29th  June  2016,  the  learned  Magistrate  had"
"arrived  at  a 
finding 
that 
it  was  not  necessary 
to 
institute  criminal"
"proceedings  against  the  Appellant.  That  had  been  a  finding  which  was"
"founded  upon 
investigational  findings  presented  to  that  court  by  the"
"Welikada police and by ASP II Nugegoda, who had been appointed by the"
"IGP to act under the supervision of the SSP Nugegoda for the purpose of"
"conducting  a  ‘special  investigation’.  Indeed,  the  learned  Magistrate  had"
"taken into consideration the representations made on behalf of the victim,"
"that  it  was  the  Appellant  who  drove the  jeep  at  the  time  of  the  accident."
"Nevertheless, the Magistrate himself did not receive evidence or cause the"
"conduct of an investigation into the identity of the driver of the jeep at the"
"time of the accident. Contrary to the view expressed by some, in my view,"
"the provisions of the CCPA do not empower a Magistrate to supervise or"
"direct 
the  conduct  of  a  police 
investigation. 
In  any  event,  as  rightly"
"submitted by the learned Snr. ASG, the order of the learned Magistrate cited"
"by learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant, was not a decision arrived"
"at 
following 
judicial 
adjudication. 
It  was 
a  mere  pre-trial 
judicial"
"endorsement  of  the  course  of  action  adopted  by  the  police  to  institute"
"criminal  proceedings  only  against 
the  2nd  Accused  –  Respondent  –"
"Respondent,  and  not  to  proceed  against  the  Appellant.  This  was  upon  a"
"prima  facie  examination  of  the  investigational  material  reported  to  the"
"Court by the two teams of police investigators. It was following the making"
"of this order, that the complaint (commonly referred to as the ‘Plaint’) was"
"presented  by  the  Officer-in-Charge  of  the  Welikada  Police  Station  under"
"section 136(1)(b) of the CCPA together with the draft ‘charge sheet’ which"
"had been drafted by the police. It was by filing of the plaint that criminal"
"proceedings were instituted against Accused (the 2nd Accused – Respondent"
"–  Respondent).  The  draft  charge  was  endorsed  by  the  Magistrate, signed"
"and read over by him to the 2nd Accused – Respondent – Respondent. Thus,"
"it would be incorrect to proceed on the footing that in the instant matter, the"
"learned  Magistrate  had  arrived  at  an  adjudicatory  judicial  finding  that  it"
"was the 2nd Accused – Respondent – Respondent who had driven the jeep"
"at  the  time  of  the  accident.  In  fact,  the  learned  Magistrate  arriving  at  a"
"judicial  finding  on  that  matter  was  circumvented  by  the  2nd  Accused  –"
"Respondent – Respondent immediately pleading ‘guilty’ to the charges."
