"","Vidyalaya in Welikada, Rajagiriya. It involved a jeep bearing No. WP KT"
"","7545 which had been driven towards Borella and a motorcycle bearing No."
"","WP  BAK  2011  which  had  been  ridden  towards  Rajagiriya.  The  jeep  was"

"","that the Sri Jayawardenapura Road is a dual carriage way and has a turning"
"","point in front of the entry into Sarana Road. The jeep had been driven on"
"","the Sri Jayawardenapura Road towards Colombo, and had been turned by"
"","the driver to the right-hand side, near the Janadhipathi Vidyalaya in order"
"","to enter Sarana Road. This necessitated the jeep to cross-over, cutting across"
"","perpendicular, to the opposite side of the Sri Jayawardenapura Road. As the"
"","front of the jeep entered Sarana Road, the motor cycle (which had an engine"
"","capacity of 1000cc) which was travelling towards Rajagiriya on the opposite"
"","side of the dual carriage way, collided with the jeep. The points of collision"
"","of the two vehicles were the left side rear of the jeep (near the rear left wheel)"
"","and the front side of the motorcycle. The exact circumstances under which"
"","the  accident  took  place,  the  identity  of  the  driver  of  the 
jeep,  and  the"
"","culpability (if any) based on negligence of such driver of the jeep and/or"
"","the rider of the motorcycle (who was one Sandeep Sampath Gunawardana)"
"","are  in  dispute.  Arriving  at  determinations  on  those  disputed  facts  is  not"

"","determined on the material available on the face of the record, the agreed"
"","facts, and the applicable law."
"4)","It is accepted between the parties that as a result of this accident, Sandeep"
"","Sampath Gunawardana and another named Minsuka (who had been on the"
"","pillion of the motor cycle) sustained grievous injuries. Most unfortunately,"
"","due  to  such  injuries  sustained,  Sandeep  Sampath  Gunawardana  remains"
"","incapacitated to-date. Along with them, had been two friends of theirs â€“ one"
"","Sideek and Gayashan, who had also been travelling on another motorcycle,"
"","close to the ill-fated motorcycle. However, that motorcycle was not involved"
"","in the accident."
