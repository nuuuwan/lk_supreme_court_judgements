"had  given  his  name  as  Brian  Scott.  However,  at  the  trial,  he  identified"
"Humphrys (the accused) as the rider of the motorcycle that he stopped. That"
"on the day in question, Constable Weight had stopped a motor cyclist was"
"not in issue. What was in issue was the identity of the rider of the motorcycle"
"which was stopped by the constable. Giving evidence, Humphrys admitted"
"that in 1972 he was disqualified to ride a motorcycle. However, he denied"
"that he had been the rider of the motorcycle which Constable Weight had"
"stopped, and suggested that one Brian Scott (who had been a lodger in his"
"house) may have been the person who rode the motorcycle, and it would"
"have been him who was stopped by the police constable. He swore that for"
"the whole of 1972, he did not ride a motorcycle. At the end of the trial, the"
"jury acquitted Humphrys (ostensibly because the jury believed Humphrysâ€™"
"testimony)."
