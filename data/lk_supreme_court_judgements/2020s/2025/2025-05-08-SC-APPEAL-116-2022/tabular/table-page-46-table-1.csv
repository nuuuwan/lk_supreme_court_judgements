"","not in any event apply to preclude a charge of perjury being brought against"
"","a  person  who  had  been  tried  for  another  offence,  and  in  respect  of  his"
"","evidence at such earlier trial."
"1
20)","In view of the foregoing, the following key points can be gleaned from"
"","the several opinions of the Lords Justices:"
"i.","That the doctrine of issue estoppel has no place in English criminal law,"
"","notwithstanding that the importation of the doctrine into criminal law"
"","had received some approval contained in obiter dicta in the judgment in"
"","Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] AC 1254."
"ii.","Even if issue estoppel was a part of English law, it could not assist a person"
"","charged  with  perjury, 
since  public  policy 
considerations  would"
"","necessitate not to be bound by the doctrine of issue estoppel."
"iii.","Lord  Hailsham  of  St.  Marylebone 
referring 
to  certain  Australian"
"","authorities in which  issue estoppel  had been recognised and applied in"
"","criminal  cases,  observed  that  the  term  had  been  used  as  ‘a  sort  of"
"","intellectual shorthand’ to describe cases of double jeopardy in which the"
"","formal pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict were not available to"
"","the accused."
"iv.","Lords  Salmon  and  Edmund-Davies  were  of 
the  view 
that 
if 
the"
"","prosecution  used  a  fresh  perjury  charge  in  an  ensuing  trial  merely"
"","because it had failed to prove an earlier charge, that would be an abuse"
"","of the process of court."
"v.","Although the House of Lords rejected issue estoppel as being applicable"
"","to 
criminal 
proceedings, 
the 
court 
recognised 
that 
in 
certain"
"","circumstances, a defendant in criminal proceedings would be entitled to"
"","be protected against double jeopardy by the court exercising its inherent"
"","power 
to  decline 
to  hear  proceedings  on 
the  ground 
that 
such"
"","proceedings  are  oppressive  and  would  amount  to  an  abuse  of 
its"
"","process."
"vi.","Lord Hailsham considered that where the evidence at a second trial was"
"","substantially identical with that  at of earlier trial, and the prosecution"
"","was in reality trying to get behind the earlier verdict of acquittal, that"
"","would  substantially 
infringe  the  rule  against  double 
jeopardy  and"
"","would also amount to an abuse of process."
"121)","In  view  of  the  foregoing,  it  is  evident  that  the  House  of  Lords  had"
"","issue  estoppel 
rejected  the  notion  that  the  doctrine  of 
is  of  mandatory"
