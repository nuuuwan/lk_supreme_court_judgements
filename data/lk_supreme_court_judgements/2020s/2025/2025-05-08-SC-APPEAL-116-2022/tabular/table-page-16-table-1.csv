"officers are servants of the State."
"37) Learned President’s Counsel concluded his submissions with the following"
"words:"
"“In  this  background,  attempting  to  attack  the  said  judgment  of  the  learned"
"Magistrate collaterally, by the Hon. Attorney-General is unlawful, scandalous,"
"and  an  abuse  of  legal  process  and  against  the  norms  of  fairness,  such  a  step"
"would  erode  the  confidence  of  right-thinking  in  the  justice  system  of  this"
"country.”"
