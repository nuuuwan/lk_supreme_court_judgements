"79) Coomaraswamy draws a distinction between the cause of action estoppel and"
"issue estoppel. He explains that cause of action estoppel arises between parties"
"by reason of a judgment given in favour of one of them and against the other"
"in regard to the cause of action set up in the first proceedings. He is of the"
"view that this is the most essential form of res judicata. It bars the setting up"
"of  a  cause  of  action  which  has  already  been  previously  determined  by  a"
"competent  court  between  the  same  parties.  In  comparison,  issue  estoppel"
"indicates estoppel generated by issues judicially determined by a competent"
"court  between  the  same  parties  in  an  earlier  proceeding.  However,  there"
"exists a qualification, that being the issue determined by the previous court"
"must be one which necessarily  and fundamentally form the very basis of"
"the earlier judgment. (cited above, p. 549) In Fidelitas Shipping Co. Ltd. vs."
"V/O Exportchleb [1966] 1 Q.B. 630, Lord Denning has correctly expressed"
"the view that issue estoppel is an extension of cause of action estoppel."
