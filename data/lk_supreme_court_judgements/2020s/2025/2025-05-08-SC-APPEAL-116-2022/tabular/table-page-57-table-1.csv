"149)","The  counter  allegations  raised  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  and  the"
"","Attorney-General raise a matter of serious concern to this Court. It relates"
"","to the enforcement of the criminal justice system. More importantly, it has"
"","implications  pertaining 
to 
the  Rule  of  Law,  which 
is  a 
fundamental"
"","principle  of  law  and  a  legal  value  of  great  importance  embedded  in  the"
"","Constitution. Thus, it is necessary for me not to depart from this judgment,"
"","without making reference to such matter."
