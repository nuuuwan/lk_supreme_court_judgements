"[D.4] Is the doctrine of issue estoppel applicable in criminal proceedings governed"
"by English law?"
"125) 
From the afore-stated detailed consideration of judgments of the apex"
"courts  of  the  United Kingdom,  it  would  appear  that,  the  present view  of"
"their  Lordships  is  that,  issue  estoppel  is  not  recognised  as  a  doctrine"
"applicable  in  criminal  proceedings  conducted  under  and  in  terms  of"
"English Law. Furthermore, Sambasivam vs. The Public Prosecutor of Malaya is"
"authority for the recognition of the underlying rationale  contained in the"
"maxim res judicata pro veritate accipitur. However, their Lordships have not,"
"colloquially 
speaking 
‘completely 
shut 
the  door’ 
for  possible 
future"
"application  of  the  doctrine  in  criminal  proceedings,  particularly  for  the"
"purpose  of  protecting  persons  against  possible  prosecutorial  abuse."
"Furthermore, even if in the unlikely event that issue estoppel is deemed to be"
"applicable in extraordinary and exceptional situations (hitherto unspecified"
"by  superior  courts  of  the  United  Kingdom),  public  policy  considerations"
"would 
justify  courts  not  to  apply  it  as  an  extension  of  the  principles"
"(autrefois

"issue

Furthermore,  even 
if 
it  may  be  possible 
to  apply 
in"
"extraordinary  and  exceptional  situations,  it  would  not  be  applied,  if  the"
"judicial determination relied upon to invoke the doctrine has been obtained"
"through fraud."
