"“More 
important 
than 
these  matters,  however,  was","the  reliance  of 
the"
"","prosecution on the statement of September 13, which, if accepted as the truth,"
"","went to prove the appellant guilty of the charge of which he had been acquitted"
"","as clearly as it proved him guilty of the offence the subject of the second trial."
"","This  circumstance  might  well  have  been  made  a  ground  for  excluding  the"
"","statement in its entirety, for it could not have been severed satisfactorily. But"
"","the point was not taken and the statement was left to the assessors, with ample"
"","warning,  it  is  true,  of  the  dangers  of  acting  on  a  retracted  confession,  but"
"","without any intimation that the prosecution could not assert, or ask court to"
"accept, a substantial and important part of what it said.”",""
"","“The fact appears to be - and the Board must judge of this from the record and"
"","the submissions of counsel who argued the appeal - that the second trial ended"
"","without  anything  having  been  said  or  done  to  inform  the  assessors  that  the"
"","appellant had been found not guilty of being in possession of the ammunition"
"","and  was  to  be  taken  as  entirely  innocent  of  that  offence.  In  fairness  to  the"
"","appellant that should have been made clear when the statement had been put in"
"","evidence, if not before. Their Lordships do not attempt to attribute or apportion"
"","responsibility for the omission. They do not know how far, if at all, the judge’s"
"","earlier  ruling as to mention  of  the fact that the trial  was a re-trial  may have"
"","discouraged  counsel  from  referring to the previous proceedings; and they are"
"","uncertain from the record whether the judge was himself aware of the acquittal."
"","But  they  cannot  avoid  the  conclusion  that  the  effect  of  the  omission  was  to"
"","render the trial unsatisfactory in a material respect. Had the assessors realized"
"","that only a part of the statement could be relied on, they might have attached"
"","greater weight to the other criticisms regarding it and rejected it altogether. And"
"","had they done so it by no means follows that they would have been prepared to"
"","accept the testimony of the Malays in preference to that of the appellant. What"
"","they would have done had the statement been excluded from evidence or its effect"
"","qualified  by  an  unequivocal  direction  as  to  the  appellant’s  acquittal  and  the"
"effect 
thereof  must,  of  course,","remain  a  matter  of  conjecture.  But 
the"
"","uncertainties are sufficiently reasonable to jeopardize the verdict reached and to"
"","justify the view, already expressed, that it ought not to stand.” (emphasis by"
"me)",""
"However,  prior  to  coming  to  the  conclusion  mentioned","in  the  above"
"paragraphs, Lord Justice MacDermott observed as follows;",""
"","“The effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent court on a lawful"
"","charge and after a lawful trial is not completely stated by saying that the person"
"","acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be added"
"","that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between"
"","the parties to the adjudication. The maxim ‘Res judicata pro veritate accipitur’"
