"Even the matters that are considered as conclusive proof, in a wider sense,"

"to prove or raise an issue to prove something contrary to what is taken as"

"Even  though  the  concept  of  issue  estoppel  in  a  wider  sense  has  various"
"manifestations,  it  appears  that 
in  most  of  the  cases,  doctrine  of  issue"
"estoppel has been discussed in much narrower sense limiting its scope to"
"the area how a decision in a previous action estops the same parties or their"
"privies  from  raising  an  issue  or  place  their evidence  in  the  second  action"
