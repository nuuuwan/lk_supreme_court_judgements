"retracted having made a confessional statement. Related to that statement,",""
"Lord  Justice  MacDermott  has  made  the  following  observations,  which  I",""
"reproduce verbatim:",""
"","“The effect of a verdict of acquittal pronounced by a competent court on a lawful"
"","charge and after a lawful trial is not completely stated by saying that the person"
"","acquitted cannot be tried again for the same offence. To that it must be added"
"","that the verdict is binding and conclusive in all subsequent proceedings between"
"the  parties  to  the  adjudication.  The  maxim","‘res  judicata  pro  veritate"
"","accipitur’  is  no  less  applicable  to  criminal  than  to  civil  proceedings."
"","Here,  the  appellant  having  been  acquitted  at  the  first  trial  on  the  charge  of"
"","having ammunition in his possession, the prosecution was bound to accept the"
"","correctness of that verdict and was precluded from taking any step to challenge"
"","it  at  the  second  trial.  And  the  appellant  was  no  less  entitled  to  rely  on  his"
"","acquittal  in  so  far  as  it  might  be  relevant  to  his  defence.  That  it  was  not"
"","conclusive of his innocence on the firearm charge is plain, but it undoubtedly"
"","reduced in some degree the weight of the case against him for at the first trial"
"","the  facts  proved  in  support  of  one  charge  were  clearly  relevant  to  the  other"
"","having regard to the circumstances in which the ammunition and the revolver"
"","were found and the fact that they fitted each other.” [Emphasis added by me.]"
