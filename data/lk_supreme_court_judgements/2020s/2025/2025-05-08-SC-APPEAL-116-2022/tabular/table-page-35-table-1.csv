"89) From","the 
above-quoted  passage 
of 
the 
judgment 
of  Lord 
Justice"
"","MacDermott, the following principles can be deciphered as being reflective"
"","of principles enshrined in English common law:"
"i","The  effect of an acquittal is not limited to the conventional scope  and"
"","application of the doctrine of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict."
"ii","Thus,  the  protection  generated  by  a  verdict  of  acquittal  is  not  only  a"
"","shield against a subsequent prosecution for having allegedly committed"
"","the same offence."
"iii  A  verdict  of  acquittal","is  binding  and  conclusive 
in  all  subsequent"
"","proceedings between the parties to the original case."
"","iv  The  maxim  ‘res  judicata  pro  veritate  accipitur’  is  applicable  to  criminal"
"","proceedings."
"v","In  subsequent  proceedings  between  the  same  parties,  the  prosecution"
"","must  accept  the  verdict  of  acquittal,  and  should  not  be  allowed  to"
"","collaterally challenge the verdict of acquittal."
"vi","In subsequent proceedings, the accused can rely on the previous verdict"
"","of acquittal in furtherance of his defence at the subsequent trial between"
"","the same parties."
