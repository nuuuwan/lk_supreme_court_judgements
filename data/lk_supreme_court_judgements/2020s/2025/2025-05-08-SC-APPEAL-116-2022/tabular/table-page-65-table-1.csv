"After  quoting  a  paragraph 
from  Sambasivam  v.  Public  Prosecutor,"
"Federation  of  Malaya  [1950]  AC  458,  which  refers  to  the  maxim  ‘Res"
"judicata pro veritate accipitur’, Basnayake C.J. on behalf of the bench which"
"heard the said appeal stated as follows:"
"“The maxim cited in the reasons of the Board delivered by Lord MacDermott is"
"one that has not been applied before in a criminal case in this country nor are"
"we aware of any case in which it has been applied in criminal proceedings in"
"England.  But that is  no reason why we should  refrain from applying it  in a"
"suitable case. The instant case is one such. The maxim is not in conflict with the"
"provisions of our statute law which govern criminal proceedings and has the"
"merit of sound good sense to commend its application to criminal proceedings.”"
"The above quoted passage shows that  while knowing  that  there were no"
"precedents in Sri Lanka and no cases in England that followed the decision"
"in  Sambasivam  case,  learned  justices  in  the  said  case  of  The  Queen  v"
"Ariyawantha  decided  to  apply  the  said  maxim  which  included  the  issue"
"estoppel  within  the  scope  of  the  above  maxim  as  described  above  to  our"
"criminal proceeding. Once a superior court decide the applicability of said"
"maxim that includes issue estoppel to criminal proceedings in that manner,"
"I doubt whether one could say it is not part of our law, now, even with the"
"help of Section 100 of the Evidence Ordinance to show that  it is no more"
"accepted 
in  England,  unless  we  overrule 
the  said  decision.  What 
is"
"important to be noted is that, though there is a reference to the said maxim,"
"what  happened  was  the  specific  issue  of  common  intention  which  was"
"decided in the previous case was not disturbed."
"However,  I  would  prefer  to  refer  to  the  said  Sambasivam  case  at  this"
"juncture.  Sambasivam  was  prosecuted  at  the  first  trial  under  emergency"
"regulations,  1948  of  carrying  a  firearm  and  of  being  in  possession  of"
"ammunitions. He was acquitted on the second charge relating to possession"
"of ammunitions at the first trial but was convicted for carrying a firearm."
"However,  a  retrial  was  ordered  on  the  charge  of  carrying  a  firearm.  It"
"appears that,  at the second trial, principal  witnesses  were the same three"
"Malays who gave evidence at the first trial. However, instead of a statement"
"made on 20.09.1948 used at the first trial, a different statement made by the"
"accused on 13.09.1948, which was the day the accused was injured, was put"
"in as evidence at the second trial. Following paragraphs found in the last"
"part  of  the  said  Sambasivam 
judgement,  in  my  view,  summarize  the"
"reasons  to  allow  the  appeal  against  the  conviction  in  the  2nd  trial  for  the"
"charge of carrying a fire arm."
