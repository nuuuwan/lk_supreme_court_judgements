"103)","The House of Lords held that, the conviction of the appellant (Connelly)"
"","on the second indictment was lawful. The court noted that a plea of autrefois"
"","acquit was not applicable because the essential ingredients of the offences of"
"","murder and robbery were not the same. Nor, would in the circumstances of"
"","the case, the evidence to sustain a conviction for the commission of robbery"
"","be  sufficient  to  sustain  a  conviction  for  murder.  Lord  Morris  held  that"
"","though the doctrine of res judicata applied to criminal cases as it did to civil"
"","cases, it might not be, and was not in the present case, possible to deduce in"
"","detail the basis of the verdict of acquittal for murder, and accordingly the"
"","doctrine  of  res  judicata  did  not  avail  the  appellant.  Lord  Devlin  observed"
"","that though, by an extension of the doctrine of autrofois acquit, that the plea"
"","could arise whenever in order to prove the offence alleged on the second"
"","indictment, the prosecution would be obliged to prove that the accused had"
"","committed an offence of which he had been either convicted or acquitted."
"","Yet,  that  did  not  avail  the  appellant  in  the  instant  case,  because  it  was"
"","unnecessary for the prosecution to rely on the fact of murder as part of the"
"","proof of robbery. Lord Devlin also noted that, even if issue estoppel applied"
"","in criminal proceedings, it would not assist the appellant. He also expressed"
"","the view that he entertains serious doubts about the value of the application"
"","of  the  doctrine  of  issue  estoppel  to  criminal  proceedings.  Whereas  Lord"
"","Pearce noted that the doctrine of issue estoppel ‘seems to be right’, but would"
"not help the appellant.",""
