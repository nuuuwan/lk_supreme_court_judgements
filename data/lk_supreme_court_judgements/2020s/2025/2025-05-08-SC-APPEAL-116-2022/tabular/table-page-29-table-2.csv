"Hailsham has drawn a distinction in the justifications between issue estoppel"
"in civil matters and issue estoppel in criminal matters. He has done so in the"
"following manner:"
"“In civil proceedings, the litigants are on an equal footing and the rules"
"of  public  policy  applying  to  each  case  are  the  same  in  principle.  In"
"criminal  proceedings  this  is  not  the  case.  The  subject  requires  to  be"
"protected against oppression by the executive, and in particular by the"
"maxim, nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa. … the cases in"
"which issue estoppel has been sought to be applied in criminal"
"cases really spring from this rule of public policy, the prohibition"
"of double jeopardy, which is intrinsically unavailable to the Crown."
"By contrast, the rule of issue estoppel in civil cases springs from"
"quite a different rule of public policy, viz the need for finality in"
"litigation  summarised  in  the  maxim,  ‘ut  finis  sit  litium’,  which  is"
"intrinsically applicable to both parties…” [Emphasis added by me.]"
