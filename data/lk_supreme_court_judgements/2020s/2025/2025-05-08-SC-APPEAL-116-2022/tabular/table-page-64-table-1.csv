judgement  too.",""
"Among other things, the appeal was pressed on the following grounds:",""
"1

"2.  That the evidence does not disclose that it was the act of the appellant",""

"too would have convicted for murder at the first trial). Thus, the prosecution",""
"and the trial judge should have taken it as a matter decided in the previous",""

"was  that  the  decision  on  the  specific  issue  of  common  intention  at  the",""

"cannot be challenged again. If it was not decided in that way,  ‘B’ and ‘C’",""
