"72) The distinction between res judicata and issue estoppel is described with great"
"clarity in Spencer Bower and Handley’s “Res Judicata” (cited above, at p. 108)"
"in the following manner:"
"“The distinction between ‘res judicata’ and ‘issue estoppel’ is that, in the first,"
"the  very  right  or  cause  of  action  claimed  or  put  in  suit  has  in  the  former"
"proceedings  been  passed  into  judgment,  so  that  it  is  merged  with  a  judicial"
"finding and has no longer an independent existence, while in the second, (i.e."
"issue estoppel) for the purpose of some other claim or cause of action, a state of"
"facts or law, the existence of  which  has been necessarily decided  by the prior"
"judgment, decree or order.” [Slightly modified by me to ensure clarity.]"
