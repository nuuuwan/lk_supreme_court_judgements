"General  C.A (PHC) NO.157/12 decided on 19.02.2015 His Lordship"
"Justice K.T Chithrasiri held that,"
"“Furthermore, the person who makes a claim under the proviso to the"
"said Section 40 could not have made such an application unless and"
"until the accused are found guilty to a charge framed under the Forest"
"Ordinance. Hence, it is clear that he is making such a claim, knowing"
"that the accused were already been convicted for a particular charge"
"under the Forest Ordinance. Therefore, the appellant is estopped from"
"claiming the cover relying on the defects in the charge sheet, in his"
"application  made  under  the  proviso  to  Section  40  of  the  Forest"
"Ordinance.”"
