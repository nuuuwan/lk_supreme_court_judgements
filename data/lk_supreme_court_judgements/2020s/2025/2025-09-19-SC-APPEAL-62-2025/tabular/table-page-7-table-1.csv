"","45/2011 dated 25.08.2011 and submitted that in the instant case, the"
"","control and possession of the vehicle in question was entirely with the"
"","registered  owner,  which  means  that  in  this  circumstance  when  the"
"","registered owner commits the offence, then the vehicle that was used"
"","to commit such an offence must also be confiscated."
"8.","Further  to  that,  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  also  submitted"
"","that the respondent had no right to challenge the jurisdiction  of the"
"","Magistrates’ Court belatedly during the appeal, when they did not raise"
"","objections in relation to the jurisdiction at the beginning of the vehicle"
"","inquiry. In the vehicle inquiry, no objection/s were taken up regarding"
"","the jurisdiction and instead, the absolute owner testified that if he knew"
"","that  the  vehicle  would  be  used  for  the  commission  of  an  offence,  he"
"","would  not  have  given  it  to  the  accused.  The  learned  Deputy  Solicitor"
"","General  argued  that,  the  position  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  that  as  the"
"","charge does not include the 'use of the vehicle' the charge is defective,"
"","is erroneous because the substantive offence does not require that as"
"","an element of the offence. She contended that, what is to be stated and"
"","proved are the elements of the offence and the “modus operandi of the"
"","commission  of  the  offence”  is  a  matter  to  be  proved  by  evidence  ."
"","Therefore, she submitted that, when the accused pleaded guilty, and"
"","no formal evidence was led, the prosecution narrative as mentioned in"
"","the  ‘B’  reports  and  production  list  along  with  the  charge  should  be"
"","considered  as  admitted  by  the  accused.  Hence  when  the  Absolute"
"","Owner takes part in the vehicle inquiry, he cannot challenge the charge."
"","Neither  the  Absolute  Owner  challenged  the  use  of  the  vehicle  in  the"
"","offence.  Therefore, 
the 
learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General 
for 
the"
"","appellants  submitted  that  the  respondents  are  estopped  from  now"
"","challenging the jurisdiction of the Magistrate and consequently call into"
"","question the validity of the charge sheet."
"9.","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  respondent  submitted  that,  the  learned"
"","Magistrate and the Learned Judges of the High Court erred by failing"
"","to evaluate that under section 40 of the Forest Ordinance it is required"
