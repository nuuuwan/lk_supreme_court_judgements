"The  evidence  led  before  the  Labour  Tribunal  establishes  the  fact  that  as  a"
"result of the investigations conducted by the respondent  company with the"
"assistance  of  two  information  technology  experts,  it  has  been  revealed  that"
"the said email originated from the company-provided computer belonging to"
"the applicant. It is clear that based on the said findings, the respondent has"
"been issued with the relevant show cause letter to the applicant."
"The evidence also reveals that the applicant having left the country without"
"obtaining prior approval of the respondent, has found overseas employment"
"and has resigned from the company soon thereafter. The relevant inquiry has"
"been held allowing him to appear via electronic means from overseas in order"
"to  give  a  fair  hearing  as  to  the  allegation  of  misconduct.  The  evidence  also"
"establishes  that  when  the  computer  of  the  applicant  was  checked  by  the"
"investigators, it has been found that all the sent messages have been deleted,"
"which  was  highly  unusual  for  a  computer  given  to  an  employee  to  use  for"
"official purposes."
"However, having examined the user history of the computer, the investigators"
"have  been  able  to  ascertain  that  in  fact,  the  said  derogatory  email  has"
"originated  from  the  computer  assigned  to  the  applicant,  and  it  has  been"
"mailed at 9.05 a.m. to the recipient with copies to several other officials of the"
"office. I find that the respondent company has well established the timeline of"
"receiving the said email to the Sri  Lankan Airline portal through  which  the"
"mail entered the Sri Lankan server, and the Yahoo website through which the"
"mail was sent."
"The explanation given by the applicant during the domestic inquiry as well as"
"before  the  Labour  Tribunal,  that  he  had  no  opportunity  to  access  his"
"computer during the relevant time period because he was at a meeting, has"
"been  well  explained  before  the  Labour  Tribunal  by  the  respondent  to  show"
"that  it  was  possible  for  the  applicant  to  access  his  computer  and  send  the"
"message  within  a  short  span  of  time  since  it  has  been  previously  prepared"
"and stored."
