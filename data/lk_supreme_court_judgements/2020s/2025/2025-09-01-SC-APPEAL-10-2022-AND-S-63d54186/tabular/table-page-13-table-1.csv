"Otherwise,  the  order  of  the  Tribunal  must  be  set  aside  as  being"
"perverse."
"3.  The Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 Section 31D states that"
"the order of a Labour Tribunal shall be final and shall not be called"
"in question in any court except on a question of law. While appellate"
"courts will not intervene with pure findings of fact, they will review"
"the findings treating them as a question of law: if it appears that the"
"Tribunal  has  made  a  finding  wholly  unsupported  by  evidence,  or"
"which  is  inconsistent  with  the  evidence  and  contradictory  of  it;  or"
"where  the  Tribunal  has  failed  to  consider  material  and  relevant"
"evidence;  or  where  it  has  failed  to  decide  a  material  question  or"
"misconstrued the question at issue and had directed its attention to"
"the wrong matters; or where there was an erroneous misconception"
"amounting to a misdirection; or where it failed to consider material"
"documents or misconstrued them or where the Tribunal has failed"
"to consider the version of one party or his evidence; or erroneously"
"supposed there was no evidence."
