ADDED RESPONDENT

SC FRA 17/2015 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 20

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The present application was filed by the members of the Provincial Public Service (Local

Government) Revenue Inspectors Trade Union (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) by petition and affidavit against the abovenamed Respondents seeking,

inter alia, a declaration that the Petitioners fundamental rights enshrined in Articles

12(1), 12(2) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been violated by one or more of the

Respondents. When this matter was taken up, this Court granted (i) leave to proceed

for the alleged infringement of rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g),

and (ii) an interim order directing the 1st-4th Respondents abovenamed to stay the

implementation of the Scheme of Recruitment dated 02nd January 20151 until the final

determination of this application.

2. The crux of this application is the Petitioners contention that the application of the

said Scheme, P14, a salary scheme based on Public Administration Circular No.

06/2004,2 to the job post of Revenue Inspector, namely in terms of the directions

pertaining to categorisation and salary scale, is arbitrary, unreasonable and in violation

of the Petitioners legitimate expectations.

3. As is the nature of such cases, it is usual for the court to be faced with a multitude of

different documents of varying natures submitted by both parties in support of their

submissions. It is, therefore, helpful to first lay out the respective submissions of the

Petitioner and Respondents contained within the petition, counter objections, answers,

and written submissions, alongside the several accompanying marked documents,

before performing an analysis and determination of the merits of the Petitioners

application.

1 Marked P14.

2 Marked P7.

SC FRA 17/2015 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 20

SUBMISSIONS OF THE PETITIONER

4. The previous recruitment procedure for the posts held by members of the Petitioner

Union, namely those of Revenue Inspectors, underwent a change in its recruitment

procedure with the implementation of a new service of recruitment (SOR) dated 02nd

November 2004.3 Subsequently, Revenue Inspectors were categorised into three

grades, and each grade was assigned a corresponding salary step, as laid out below:

i. Grade II recruitment grade MN-1 (Step 12)

ii. Grade I MN-1 (Step 23)

iii. Supra Grade MN-7.

5. The government issued Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006 dated 25th April

2006, P7, with the aim of recategorising/regrouping all posts in the public service and

implementing new salary structures. In accordance with P7, the Petitioner was placed

on salary scale MN-1 Step 12 (the first categorisation, as above).

6. The Petitioner members aver that such placement is incorrect and/or inappropriate by

reason of their belief that they possess the necessary qualifications in terms of SOR

P4(b) to be eligible for placement on salary scale MN-5. This position is rooted in the

Petitioners contention that in terms of previous SORs, the percentage division of cadre

vacancies for the post of Revenue Inspectors is a delegation of (i) 60% for officers who

sat the Limited Competitive Examination and held a post in a local government

institution or officers who had been made permanent in their posts and completed 5

years of service; and, (ii) 40% for officers who sat the Open Competitive Exam and are

graduates of recognised degree programs offered in universities in Sri Lanka. The

Petitioner submitted that, at the time the petition was filed, more than 50 Revenue

Inspectors fell in the former category, and 32 fell in the latter (and therefore held a

degree qualification).

3 Marked P4(b).

SC FRA 17/2015 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 20

7. According to the Petitioner, the 2nd Respondent (Chief Secretary) approved a SOR

dated 02nd January 2015,4 despite the Petitioner voicing objections to the same. Such

objections, the Petitioner submits, were based on the purported adverse effects of the

said SOR such as, inter alia, reducing the minimum qualifications and removing the

degree requirement as well as the efficiency bar exams which downgrades the

standards of the service, arbitrarily removing the category of supra Grade and thus

restricting the opportunity of promotion, and placing the Petitioner members on a

lower salary scale than clerical staff members who worked under the Petitioner

members.

8. The Petitioner sought from this Court, inter alia, a declaration that their rights under

Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) were thus violated and, further, a sum of Rs. 10 million in

compensation excluding costs.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS

9. The submissions of the Respondents are extracted from the affidavit of the 10th

Respondent dated 22nd December 2016, the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent dated 02nd

May 2017, and the written submissions on behalf of the Respondents dated 27th

October 2022 and 28th November 2024.

10. The Respondents submit that, based on the Scheme of Recruitment P4(b), of the

vacancies available for the post of Revenue Inspector Class II, only 40% could be filled

by those possessing a degree, whereas 60% were required to be filled by those

possessing six passes at the Ordinary Level Examination. Therefore, the post of

Revenue Inspector Class II cannot be considered as one that strictly requires the

completion of a degree to be recruited. Accordingly, the post was assigned to salary

scale MN-1.

4 Marked P14.

SC FRA 17/2015 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 20

11. The Respondents submitted to this court letters5 by the Chief Secretary of the National

Salaries and Cadre Commission in response to the requests submitted by the Petitioner

pertaining to a change in the assigned salary scale. In such letters, the Chief Secretary

emphasises the inability to recommend a different salary scale for the post of Revenue

Inspector of the Western Province by reason that the post is not one which has a strict

degree requirement and further that the already approved salary structure as per P14

was so decided and assigned to all Revenue Inspectors serving in all Provinces. As such,

placing officers in the Western Province on a different scale would create a significant

anomaly within the approved salary structures applicable to public officers.

Consequent to this, a new Scheme of Recruitment, P14, received assent by the

Governor on 2nd January 2015.

12. It is the Respondents position that, provided that individuals possessing five years

experience and having passed four subjects at the O/L examination were also able to

apply to the post of Revenue Inspector (alongside those who held a degree),

possessing a degree was not the sole criteria for requirement. As such, the degree

requirement was dispensed with in the introduction of the new Scheme of

Recruitment, P14. Furthermore, MN-4 is a classification reserved for officers who were

recruited to posts with a strict degree requirement, such salary scale cannot be applied

to Revenue Inspectors Class II. The Respondents also stress that it is not pragmatic to

assign different scales to the same post whereby Revenue Inspectors who were

recruited on the basis of a degree qualification and those who were required on the

basis of O/L qualifications are placed on different salary structures.

13. Further, the Respondents submit that, in response to addressing the Petitioner's

grievances and remedying the absence of promotional prospects and the issue of

5 dated 23rd May 2014 and 15th December 2014 respectively and marked 10R2 and 10R3 respectively.

SC FRA 17/2015 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 20

stagnation, a Special Grade was proposed6 and approved7 by the Department of

Management Services.

ANALYSIS

14. Article 12(1) of the Constitution guarantees that All persons are equal before the law

and are entitled to the equal protection of the law. In terms of Article 14(1)(g), Every

citizen is entitled to the freedom to engage by himself or in association with others in

any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise.

15. It is pertinent to note that, at the time of filing the petition, the Petitioner members

had also challenged P7 in the Court of Appeal by way of a writ application bearing No.

229/2009. The appellate court, by judgment dated 24th November 2015, dismissed the

application and denied the Petitioner relief, inter alia, on the basis that the court, in

several instances, has stressed that the salary of a public servant is a policy decision of

the government, and therefore not subject to judicial review by the Court of Appeal.

The Court of Appeal explained that the National Salary and Cadre Commission

considers all facts before them before making recommendations for salary placement,

and it is, in fact, only the Commission that possesses the relevant expertise to do so.

16. I am inclined to agree with the position of the Court of Appeal that the

recommendations of the National Salary and Cadre Commission are policy decisions.

However, that does not by itself preclude fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court.

If the Petitioner can establish that such recommendations are violative of fundamental

rights they may be entitled to relief under fundamental rights jurisdiction.

7 By letter dated 16th November 2016 marked 2R8.

SC FRA 17/2015 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 20

17. The Respondents, in their written submissions dated 21st October 2024, cite the case

of B.H.D.H. Tilakaratne v B.A.P. Ariyaratne SC FR Application 272/2016,8 wherein

Justice Malalgoda emphasises that Article 12(1),

guarantees every citizen an equal opportunity in the matters affecting his

personal life including employment opportunity, but it does not mean that all

persons are to be treated alike in all circumstances. It means that persons who

are similarly circumstanced must be similarly treated. However, it is permitted

for the state to make laws that are unequal when dealing with persons who

are placed in different circumstances in other words the law permits the

classification of persons when enacting laws. However, such classification

should not be irrational or arbitrary. It must be reasonable.9

18. In the case of Wickramasinghe v Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and others, 10 this

Court distinguished between reasonableness and arbitrariness, stating that as long as

an action is based on a justifiable and rational policy decision, it cannot be considered

arbitrary.

19. The Respondents have, in my view, satisfactorily established that the changes

introduced by the circulars and schemes of recruitment in question were made as part

of a structured and consistent salary policy rather than as an arbitrary or discriminatory

act targeting a specific group of employees. Accordingly, the introduction of the new

Scheme of Recruitment, by virtue of being derived from the Public Administration

Circular No. 06/2006 and verified by the National Salaries and Cadre Commission,

constitutes a reasonable decision. Mere dissatisfaction with a policy change does not,

9 Emphasis is mine.

10 [2001] 2 Sri LR 409.

SC FRA 17/2015 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 20

in itself, amount to a violation of fundamental rights unless it can be shown that the

decision lacked any reasonable basis.

20. Thus, in the application of this principle, I do not find any basis to challenge the

proposition that the Respondents' decision to adhere to Circular No. 06/2006 is, in

fact, a rational policy choice rather than an arbitrary exercise of power.

21. Furthermore, I am inclined to agree with the Respondents assertion that any action to

change the approved salary scale assigned to the post held by the Petitioner members,

contrary to the salary scale and administered by the Circulars and the Scheme of

Recruitment would essentially cause the National Salaries and Cadre Commission to

be in breach of its statutory duty. Such action would create a pronounced discrepancy

between Revenue Inspectors operating in the Western Provinces versus those holding

posts in other Provinces.

22. Similarly, it is my view that assigning different salary steps to the same post on the

grounds of varying recruitment criteria (i.e., differentiating amongst those who were

recruited by virtue of holding a degree versus officers who passed the O/L examination

and satisfied the requirement of having 5 years in experience) may in and of itself cause

discrimination amongst the officers of the public service and culminate in unequal

treatment contrary to Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

23. It was observed by this Court in the case J. A. Lionel Chandraratne v Mr. Tissa R.

Balalla, The Governor of the Northwestern Province,11 that It is obligatory for the

Petitioner to prove that he has been treated differently to succeed in terms of Article

12(1) of the Constitution. Moreover, in the case C.W. Mackie & Co. Ltd. v. H.

Mologoda, Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,12 the Court held that in order

11 S.C/FR Application No. 204/2011, SC Minutes of 20th May 2015, p 13.

12 [1986] (1) Sri LR 300, p 301.

SC FRA 17/2015 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 20

to sustain a claim of discrimination under Article 12(1), a party must satisfy two key

requirements:

a. That they have been treated differently from others;

b. That they have been treated differently from persons similarly

circumstanced without a reasonable basis.

24. I fail to see any material placed before this Court by the Petitioner that satisfies either

of these two requirements. In the Petitioners written submission dated 28th November

2024, the Petitioner emphasises that they did not seek to challenge the Public

Administration Circular No. 06/2006, P7, but rather only ought to quash the decision

to categorise the Petitioner members under the MN-1 salary scale introduced by the

said Circular and confirmed by the subsequent Scheme of Recruitment P14. However,

I do not find any merit in the challenge of the assignment of such salary structure to

the post held by the Petitioner members. P7 was introduced subsequent to a policy

decision to ensure uniformity across officers in the Provincial Public Service. It is clear

that possessing a degree was never the sole criterion to be recruited for the post of

Revenue Inspector Class II based on previous schemes P4(a) and P4(b), whereby 60%

of the vacancies are required to be filled by applicants who passed the O/L examination

with the necessary threshold. Accordingly, Revenue Inspectors were placed on salary

scale MN-1 instead of MN-4, which is reserved for, inter alia, posts with strict degree

requirements. Such decisions are confirmed and endorsed by the National Salaries and

Cadre Commission.

25. Thus, I am of the view that the decision of the Respondents to adhere to the Circular

No.06/2006 and the accompanying Scheme of Recruitment is reasonable and devoid

of any basis for the violation of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution. It follows, therefore, that nor have the Petitioners

rights guaranteed by Article 14(1)(g) been the subject of any violations by the

Respondents.

SC FRA 17/2015 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 20

CONCLUSION

26. On the above facts, circumstances, and analysis, I find that the Petitioner has failed to

establish a violation of their fundamental rights under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution by one or more of the Respondents.

Application Dismissed.
