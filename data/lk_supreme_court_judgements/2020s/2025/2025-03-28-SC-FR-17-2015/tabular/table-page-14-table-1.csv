"7.  According  to  the  Petitioner,  the  2nd  Respondent  (Chief  Secretary)  approved  a  SOR"
"dated 02nd January 2015,4 despite the Petitioner voicing objections to the same. Such"
"objections, the Petitioner submits, were based on the purported adverse effects of the"
"said SOR such as, inter alia, reducing the minimum qualifications and removing the"
"degree  requirement  as  well  as  the  efficiency  bar  exams  which  downgrades  the"
"standards of the service, arbitrarily removing the category of ‘supra Grade’ and thus"
"restricting  the  opportunity  of  promotion,  and  placing  the  Petitioner  members  on  a"
"lower  salary  scale  than  clerical  staff  members  who  worked  under  the  Petitioner"
"members."
