"of B.H.D.H. Tilakaratne v B.A.P. Ariyaratne SC FR Application 272/2016,8 wherein"
"Justice Malalgoda emphasises that Article 12(1),"
"“…guarantees  every  citizen  an  equal  opportunity  in  the  matters  affecting  his"
"personal  life  including  employment  opportunity,  but  it  does  not  mean  that  all"
"persons are to be treated alike in all circumstances. It means that persons who"
"are similarly circumstanced must be similarly treated. However, it is permitted"
"for the state to make laws that are unequal when dealing with persons who"
"are placed in different circumstances in other words the law permits the"
"classification of persons when enacting laws. However, such classification"
"should not be irrational or arbitrary. It must be reasonable.”9"
