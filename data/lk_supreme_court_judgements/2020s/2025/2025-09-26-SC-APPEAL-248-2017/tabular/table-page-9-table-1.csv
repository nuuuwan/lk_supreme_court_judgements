"marked P2 has been established in terms of Section 68 of the Partition"
"Law read along with Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance?”"
"M
y analysis hereafter will be confined to examining the aforesaid question of"
"law based on which leave was granted. The matter for consideration by this"
"court is whether the Deed marked P2 has been established in terms of Section"
"68 of the Partition Law read along with Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"T
he Plaintiff gave evidence and thereafter commenced her evidence anew. The"
"Respondents contended that the Plaintiff has given clear evidence in respect"
"of the preliminary plan and report and she also gave evidence of the pedigree"
"and the fact that ½ an acre was purchased by her from the Appellant on Deed"
"1530 when the Appellant had offered to sell the land. Since the notary to deed"
"1530 had died the Respondent placed the death certificate of the notary before"
"court  to  show  that  she  cannot  call  him  as  a  witness.  This  document  was"
"admitted without further objection at the closing of the case of the Appellants."
"The  Respondents  submitted  that  hence  the  court  is  bound  to  accept  such"
"documents as evidence and as documents which have been proved."
"The Plaintiff contended that, initially she had only given a part payment of the"
"consideration due on Deed 1530 marked P2 and the later the balance sum of"
"money was paid by her to the Appellant marked as P3."
"The Respondents contended that they had led cogent and credible evidence"
"to establish the validity of Deed No. 1530 and the payment of consideration"
"thereunder. The Plaintiff, in her testimony, affirmed that the land was offered"
"to her at a time when she too was in need of land, and that she made an initial"
"part payment to the Appellant, with the balance being paid subsequently. A"
"receipt for the final payment was marked as “P3” and was admitted without"
"objection, thereby affirming the payment. The Plaintiff also explained that the"
"Appellant urgently required money to fund the legal defence of her paramour"
"in a criminal matter."
