"was  the  submission  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that,  in  an"
"instance where the subject matter has not properly been identified by"
"its boundaries, the land in question cannot be partitioned."
"18. 
It  was  also  submitted  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that,  the"
"learned  Distcrict  Judge  has  erred  in  stating  that  “තවද  ගම්  කිසිඳු  මා"
"යිමක්  මූලි   පිම්ුගේ  මා  යිම්  සමෙ  ගනා  ෙැ  ලගේ.  පැ  මිනිල්ගල්  උපගල්ඛණගේ"

"ඔේු  වල  සඳහන්  අයුරින්ම  වේතමා  නගේ  ද  මා  යිම්  තිබිය  යුතු   ව  ඉන්  අදහස්"
"ගනා ගේ”. It was the position of the learned Counsel that the ග ා ටු ැ ම්ම"
"cannot  change  as  it  is  very  old.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel"
"submits that it is the duty of the trial Judge to identify the land with"
"precision before allowing it to be partitioned."
"19.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  respondent  submitted  that  the  land"
"sought 
to  be  partitioned  has  been 
correctly  depicted 
in 
the"
"preliminary plan bearing No. 2287. On perusing the schedule to the"
"amended  plaint  and  the  preliminary  plan,  it  is  apparent  that  the"
"eastern  boundary 
tallies 
in  both 
the  preliminary  plan  and

the 
plaint. 
Both

to 
the 
boundary 
as"
"“Bogahakumbura”."

"Court to deeds marked P-1, P-2, and P-5 (at pages 334, 336, and 348"
"of 
the  brief  respectively).  These  are  deeds  drawn 
in  relation 
to"
"“Pussekumbura” which is the subject matter of this action."
"21.  According 
to  deed  marked  P-1, 
the  northern,  western  and 
the"
"southern boundaries are described as follows,"
"උතුරට - කුරුවිටගේ යග ෝ නිස් සිල්වා ට අයිති වත්ත"
"ස්නා හිරට - ෙල් න්ද"
"දකුණට - කුරුවිටගේ මිනිසුන්ට අයිති මුනමල්ෙහකුඹුර"
