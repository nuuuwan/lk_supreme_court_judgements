"28.","In  the  case  of  Jayasooriya  V.  Ubaid  61  NLR  352  at  353  His"
"","Lordship Sansoni, J. stated that,"
"","“
there is no question that there was a duty cast on the Judge to"
"","satisfy  himself  as 
to 
the 
identity  of  the 
land  sought 
to  be"
"","partitioned,  and for this purpose it  was  always open  to him  to"

for 
further 
evidence 
in 
order 
to  make 
a

"29.","Identification  of  the  corpus  is  a  fundamental  aspect  that  has  to  be"
"","satisfied  in  an  action  for  partition  of  a  land.  In  this  instance,  three"

"30.","In Sopaya Silva and Another V. Magilin Silva [1989] 2 SLR 105"
"","it was stated that,"
"","“
Section 16(1) of the Partition law requires that a commission be"
"","issued  ""to  a  surveyor  directing  him  to  survey  the  land  to  which"
"","the  action 
relates"". 
It 
implies 
that 
the 
land  surveyed  must"
"","conform  substantially,  with  the  land  as  described  in  the  plaint"
"","(and  in respect of  which  a  lis pendens has been registered),  as"
"","regards the location, boundaries and the extent. Further, it is for"
"","this  reason 
that  section  18(1)(a)(iii)  requires 
the  surveyor 
to"
"","express an opinion in his report”"
"31.  Acting in accordance with section 18(1)(a)(iii) of the Partition Act, the",""
"","surveyor  in  executing  the  commission  issued  to  him,  has  clearly"

the  surveyor  has  not  given  evidence  and 
the"

"","without objection."
