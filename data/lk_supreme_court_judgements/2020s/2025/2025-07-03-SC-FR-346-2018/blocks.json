Approximately 250 villagers of the village of Kalukele took part, protesting against the inaction on the part of the authorities at preventing the invasion of their village and fields by wild elephants, which was causing considerable hardships to them. The protest caused a complete blockage of the main road for over two hours. Admittedly, the two Petitioners participated in this protest. On an application made by the police, the learned Magistrate issued an order under section 106 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act on two named individuals, requiring the discontinuation of the protest. The two Petitioners claim that they were unaware of the order made by the learned Magistrate and that in any event the order was not directed at them. On 18th June 2018, the two Petitioners along with another villager were arrested by officers of the Aralaganwila Police Station in relation to committing certain offences relating to this protest. That same day, they were remanded by the learned Magistrate of Polonnaruwa. The Petitioners claim that the police acted unlawfully, and that the arrest was an infringement of their fundamental rights. This Judgment examines the lawfulness of the protest and the arrest of the two Petitioners and concludes upon the disputed issues. The Judgment also contains an examination of the law relating to the conduct of protests and demonstrations. Formalities",

They are common occurrences in most democracies. Public protests often culminate in holding of public meetings. It is commonplace to hear from protest sites rhetorical and repetitive utterances of slogans often containing condemnation of persons and policies as well as demands of the protesters. Possibly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s style of peaceful activism, Sri Lanka has witnessed unique forms of protests, including Satyagrahas and candle-light vigils wherein spirituality is sought to be infused into peaceful protests associated with at time resistance and non-compliance which take the form of civil disobedience. At the other end of the spectrum of protests is the Ali Jinnah style of protests with the call of \u2018direct action\u2019 wherein the demands of the protesters are to be achieved primarily by the protesters themselves, through action aimed at causing change. Then there are protests which are used as stepping stones for political revolutions. Recently in 2022, Sri Lanka witnessed a possible attempt at achieving such a political revolution, through the conduct of series of protests which carried the vernacular nomenclature \u201cAragalaya\u201d (meaning a \u2018struggle\u2019), that inter-alia resulted in the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka of that era being compelled to vacate office and resign.",

Basically, at a public protest, what is seen and heard is the expression of a grievance by a segment of the community, condemnation of that situation and a call for reformative action. Indeed, there can be an element of political activism in it as well. Certain political parties more than the others use protests to publicly voice their criticism of policies and practices of the State. The primary objective of a protest is to attract the attention of the authorities and the public at large, create public opinion and garner support, which may sometimes result in public authorities responding to demands being made or at least entering into discussions with the protesters with the view to resolving grievances and problems encountered by the protesters. As the immediate goal of protesters is to attract attention, they choose public venues for the conduct of their protest. Often people resort to protests when they perceive the lack or the absence of meaningful responsiveness of the authorities to their cause. Public protests, demonstrations and associated public meetings may have a political undertone and may be the outcome of political stratagem. Such political flavour does in no way make an otherwise lawful protest, unlawful. It is not uncommon to observe policies of the State being suspended, reversed or varied as a result of protests which are sustained over a period of time and those that galvanize public support. Thus, the potential of protests and demonstrations being efficacious tools of activism and advocacy.",

It is important to note that, what Article 14(1)(a) envisages is the freedom of speech and expression in a manner that does not infringe the law, and what Article 14(1)(b) recognises is the fundamental right to engage in lawful and peaceful assembly.

LR 220 at 236 - 238], \u201cArticle 14(1)(b) of the Constitution recognizes the freedom of peaceful assembly, the qualification being the \u2018peaceful\u2019 nature of the assembly. Therefore, even a protest may be protected under Article 14(1)(b) as long as it remains peaceful\u201d. His Lordship Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare in that Judgment has further observed that \u201cwhen a peaceful assembly later takes on an unlawful hue in the above manner, it no longer enjoys the full entitlement to the freedom of assembly recognized in Article 14(1)(b). In the event of such an assembly, by the operation of Article 15(7) of the Constitution, it is permissible to impose such restrictions \u201cas may be prescribed by law\u201d imposed inter alia \u201cin the interests of ... public order\u201d \u2026 \u2018public order or peace\u2019 envisages a climate in which the public can go about their routine of daily activities without unusual disturbances.

Specific provision in that regard is necessary in my view, since public roads are primarily for movement of vehicles and the sidewalks to be used by pedestrians, and a procession on a road would be the exception. A procession on a road necessitates the adoption of certain special arrangements to ensure that vehicular movement does not come to a grinding halt due to obstruction caused by an ongoing procession. This would necessitate the organisers of the procession to give prior notice to the police of their intention. Section 77 of the Police Ordinance and Police Order E5 regulates the duty of both the organisers of processions and the Police. Once special arrangements are made by the Police, it is also the duty of the police to not \u2018roam at will\u2019 and continue to impose further restrictions on the freedom of movement and expression of the persons taking part in the procession and unnecessarily curtain such procession.",

Thereby, they have committed the offence of causing \u2018Danger or obstruction in a public way or line of navigation\u2019 defined and made punishable by section 276 of the Penal Code. More fundamentally, by the willful obstruction of the passage of vehicles along the Polonnaruwa \u2013 Mahiyanganaya main road and not having a reasonable excuse (recognised by law) for causing such obstruction, the protesters have committed an offence under section 59(1) of the National Thoroughfares Act, No. 40 of 2008. Evidence with regard to the committing of these offences emanate from the narrative provided by the 1st Respondent and by the description of the incident given by vehicle drivers Saranga Kiriella, Ranjith Ruwan and Susil Shantha. Furthermore, from the statements made by them, it is evident that the protesters had prevented them from moving in the direction in which they wished to travel and had the right to proceed. This would amount to the offence of wrongful restraint, as defined in section 330 of the Penal Code and made punishable in terms of section 332 of the said Code. 50.

Thus, in this Judgment, I shall not comment on the lawfulness or otherwise of the process adopted by the police and the order made by the learned Magistrate. Suffice me to note that, when an unlawful assembly takes place, in terms of section 95 of the CCPA, any Magistrate or a police officer not below the rank of an Inspector of police may command such unlawful assembly to disperse. Furthermore, section 98 of the CCPA empowers a Magistrate to inter alia direct that any unlawful obstruction or nuisance be removed from any way (which would include a road) which may be lawfully used by the public. However, it appears that not resorting to those two sections does not prevent the police from making an application to a Magistrate to make an order under section 106 of the CCPA. However, both when making an application to a Magistrate to issue an order either under section 98 or 106 of the CCPA, as well as when making an order as requested by the police, both the police as well as Magistrates must be acutely conscious of the de-facto fundamental right to protest and demonstrate, and should curtail it to the minimum extent possible and do so only in wider public interest and for the maintenance of public order. 54.

That the investigation is incomplete (by itself) is not a valid ground to deny a suspect bail, unless it can be established that there are certain investigational steps that need to be taken, which investigational steps cannot be effectively carried out unless during the period of such investigation the suspect remains in remand custody. Furthermore, that other suspects are to be arrested, is also not a ground (by itself) to seek the extension of the period of remand of the suspects produced. However, it is apparent, that this is not one of those cases. In the circumstances of this case, the enlargement of the suspects on bail would not have been an impediment to the arrest of the other suspects. Furthermore, the 1st Respondent has not shown any ground contained in section 14 of the Bail Act, which would justify the suspects being denied bail and being placed in remand custody. Therefore, this Court holds that the learned Magistrate\u2019s perfunctory decision to place the two Petitioners in remand custody and thereby deprive them of their liberty, was (a) based on the Report presented to the Magistrate by the 1st Respondent which was not in compliance with the law, and (b) devoid of a justifiable reason for placing the two Petitioners in remand custody. Of course, there may be situations where the remand of a suspect for a limited period of time would be in the best interests of achieving the objectives of criminal justice, and in particular would enable investigators to conduct an effective investigation. In such instances, placing the suspect in remand custody should be favourably considered by a Magistrate for reasons to be recorded.",

It would thus be seen that, though the 1st Respondent had produced the two Petitioners before the learned Magistrate well within the stipulated time limit, he had failed to comply with the law as regards the preparation of the B Report according to law. Furthermore, his application to the learned Magistrate that the two Petitioners be placed in remand custody was arbitrary and also contrary to law. This has resulted in the denial of freedom to the two Petitioners for 14 days as a result of they having been detained in remand custody.

    "text": "prevailed at the time of the protest referred to in this Judgment had a direct impact on the villagers of Kalukele exercising their fundament right to life and their peaceful livelihoods and occupation, and therefore it is the bounded Constitutional duty of the State to ensure that effective action is taken to prevent further attacks on the villagers and their property by elephants. This Court also notes that norms relating to environmental protection and sustainable development now recognised by law, also requires wild animals such as elephants to be given adequate space in their traditional habitat to live and sustain themselves. The Court notes that the human \u2013 elephant conflict is a relatively new phenomenon occasioned due to unplanned and ad hoc development and human habitat extending into the traditional areas of wild animals and the ensuing shrinking of space for wild animals to gather food. Possibly some amount of such expansion is unavoidable due to factors associated with population growth and the need to ensure sufficient production of agricultural crops for human consumption. However, the Court notes that the impact of this phenomenon can be mitigated by well-planned and effectively implemented measures being adopted. It is not the function of this Court to venture into setting out what type of measures ought to be taken, nor does it claim to possess the necessary expertise to do so. However, this Court notes that it would be prudent to act on expert advice and adopt a multi-disciplinary approach in formulating strategies for implementation. Due to these reasons, unless the situation has by now been remedied in an effective and sustainable manner, this Court calls upon the relevant authorities to take immediate and meaningful action to prevent the human \u2013 elephant conflict and to take measures aimed at protecting the people and their property as well as wild animals.",
