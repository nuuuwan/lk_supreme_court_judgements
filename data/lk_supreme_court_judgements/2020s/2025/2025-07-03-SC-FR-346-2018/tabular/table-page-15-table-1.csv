"","exercise of the freedom of assembly must not, offend the law relating to nuisance,"

"","39. In  a  public  protest,  it  is  possible  to  observe  three  fundamental  rights  being"
"","exercised both individually and collectively. They are, the freedom of speech and"
"","expression including publication [Article 14(1)(a)], freedom of peaceful assembly"
"","[Article 14(1)(b)], and the freedom of association [Article 14(1)(c)]. The exercise of"
"","these three fundamental rights is intertwined in almost all public protests, and it"
"","can  be  said  that  the  Constitution  recognises  de-facto  a  composite  fundamental"
"","right  to  ‘demonstrate  and  protest’.  It  is  important  to  note  that,  what  Article"
"","14(1)(a) envisages is the freedom of speech and expression in a manner that does"
"","not infringe the law, and what Article 14(1)(b) recognises is the fundamental right"
"","to engage in lawful and peaceful assembly. As persistently upheld by this Court"
"","in  several  cases  such  as  in  Bandara  and  Others  v.  Jagoda  Arachchi,  OIC,  Fort"
"","police  station  and  Others  [(2000)  1  Sri.  LR  225  at  230],  “the  freedom  of  peaceful"
"","assembly  and  the  freedoms  of  speech  and  expression,  related  to  such  an  assembly  are"
"","liberties vital to the functioning of a democratic society and every citizen is entitled to the"
"exercise of these freedoms by virtue of Article 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution”.",""
"","40. On the other hand, it is equally important to note that as held by this Court in the"
"","case of Kumara and Others v. OIC, Police Station, Katunayake and Others [(2019)"
"","3 Sri. LR 220 at 236 - 238], “Article 14(1)(b) of the Constitution recognizes the freedom"
"of  peaceful  assembly,  the  qualification  being  the","‘peaceful’  nature  of  the  assembly."
"","Therefore,  even a protest may be protected under  Article  14(1)(b)  as long  as it remains"
"","peaceful”. His Lordship Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare in that Judgment has further"
"","observed  that  “when  a  peaceful  assembly  later  takes  on  an  unlawful  hue  in  the  above"
"","manner, it no longer enjoys the full entitlement to the freedom of assembly recognized in"
"","Article 14(1)(b). In the event of such an assembly, by the operation of Article 15(7) of the"
"","Constitution, it is permissible to impose such restrictions “as may be prescribed by law”"
"","imposed inter alia “in the interests of ... public order” … ‘public order or peace’ envisages"
"","a climate in which the public can go about their routine of daily activities without unusual"
"","disturbances. Whether an act constitutes a disturbance of the public order or peace, depends"
"","on the extent of its ability to disrupt the usual pace of daily activities of the public.”. Thus,"
"","for an assembly to be peaceful, it should not only be void of any violence, it"
"","should  be  conducted  according  to  law  as  well.  Thus,  the  governing  principle"
"","relating to the exercise of the de-facto fundamental right to demonstrate and protest"
"","is  the  exercise  of  its  constituent  fundamental  rights  in  a  manner  that  does  not"
