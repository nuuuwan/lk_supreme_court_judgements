"","the  case,  and  (ii)  a  summary  of  the  statements  recorded  in  the  course  of  the"
"","investigation.  All  what  it  contains  are  two  allegations  that  the  suspects  had"
"committed offences and a request that they be placed in remand custody.",""
"","64. Upon the suspects being produced before the learned Magistrate, as evident from"
"","“X6”, he had placed the three  suspects in remand custody on the basis that  the"
"","police investigation was incomplete and certain other suspects have to be arrested."
"","65. The afore-stated B Report does not contain any valid reason for the police to have"
"","sought from the learned Magistrate that the two Petitioners be placed in remand"
"","custody. That the investigation is incomplete (by itself) is not a valid ground to"
"deny  a 
suspect  bail,  unless 
it 
can  be  established 
that","there  are 
certain"
"","investigational steps that need to be taken, which investigational steps cannot be"
"","effectively carried out unless during the period of such investigation the suspect"
"","remains in remand custody. Furthermore, that other suspects are to be arrested, is"
"","also not a ground (by itself) to seek the extension of the period of remand of the"
"","suspects produced. However, it is apparent, that this is not one of those cases. In"
"","the circumstances of this case, the enlargement of the suspects on bail would not"
"","have been an impediment to the arrest of the other suspects. Furthermore, the 1st"
"","Respondent  has  not  shown  any  ground  contained  in  section  14  of  the  Bail  Act,"
"","which would justify the suspects being denied bail and being placed in remand"
"","custody.  Therefore,  this  Court  holds  that  the  learned  Magistrate’s  perfunctory"
"","decision to place the two Petitioners in remand custody and thereby deprive them"
"","of their liberty, was (a) based on the Report presented to the Magistrate by the 1st"
"","Respondent  which  was  not  in  compliance  with  the  law,  and  (b)  devoid  of  a"
"","justifiable  reason  for  placing  the  two  Petitioners  in  remand  custody.  Of  course,"
"","there may be situations where the remand of a suspect for a limited period of time"
"","would be in the best interests of achieving the objectives of criminal justice, and in"
"","particular would enable investigators to conduct an effective investigation. In such"
"","instances, placing the suspect in remand custody should be favourably considered"
"by a Magistrate for reasons to be recorded.",""
"66. With 
regards 
to 
the  duty  cast  on  Magistrates 
to 
refrain","from  conducting"
"","themselves in a perfunctory manner and to always act judiciously, this Court in"
"","the case of Dayananda v. Weerasinghe and others [(1983) 2 Sri. LR 84 at 92] has"
"","held that “Magistrates should be more vigilant and comply with the requirements of the"
