"43. With regard to the response by the police, one cannot overlook the possibility of"
"the police being genuinely anxious of what appears to be a peaceful protest cum"
"demonstration  suddenly  turning  into  a  violent  outburst  (with  or  without  any"
"external interference), and the occurrence of mob violence resulting in a serious"
"disruption of public order and causing of damage to public and private property."
"Even where the apprehension of the police appears to be sincere, any preventive"
"action  or  action  aimed  at  halting  the  demonstration  must  be  founded  upon  a"
"clear  and  present  danger  of  the  peaceful  gathering  converting  itself  into  an"
"unlawful  assembly  and  affecting  public  order  and  security,  and  should  be"
"responded  to  with  a  proportional  response  implemented  strictly  according  to"
"law.  Use  of  force  should  be  the  last  resort.  Lethal  force  may  be  used  only  if"
"according to the provisions of the Penal Code, the use of such force is justified"
"and is absolutely essential."
"44. Law enforcement measures including the use of force as well as criminal justice"
"measures such as causing the arrest of protesters should certainly not be aimed"
"at  or  carried  out  with  the  motive  of  summarily  punishing  or  harassing  those"
"who have engaged in an unlawful protest or demonstration. Should there have"
"been a transgression of the law, the violators of the law should be dealt  with"
"strictly according to law, in good faith and in a proportional manner."
