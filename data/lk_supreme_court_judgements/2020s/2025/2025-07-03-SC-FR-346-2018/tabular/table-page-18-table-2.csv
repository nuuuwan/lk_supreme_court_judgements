"[(1999) 2 Sri. LR 166 at 170] Justice Dr. A.R.B. Amerasinghe examining the scope of"
"the rights recognised by Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution has observed"
"the following:"
"“While I do not accept the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can"
"be labelled ""speech"" whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby"
"to  express  an  idea,  I  do,  however,  accept  the  fact  that  marching,  parading  and"
"picketing on the streets and holding meetings in parks and other public places may"
"constitute methods of expression entitled to the protection of the freedoms declared"
"and recognized in Articles 14 (1) (a) and (b) of the Constitution. Streets and parks"
"and  public  places  are  held  in  trust  for  the  use  of  the  public  and  have  been"
"customarily  used  for  purposes  of  assembly,  communicating  thoughts  between"
"citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets, parks and public"
"places is a part of the privileges, immunities, rights and liberties of citizens”."
