"33. Most public protests and demonstrations are aimed at highlighting the plight of"
"the  public  at 
large  or 
communities  adversely  affected  by  an 
identifiable"
"phenomenon, general state of affairs affecting the poor, the vulnerable or the weak,"
"or a  particular  policy of importance adopted or intending  to be adopted by  the"
"authorities. Basically, at a public protest, what is seen and heard is the expression"
"of a grievance by a segment of the community, condemnation of that situation and"
"a call for reformative action. Indeed, there can be an element of political activism"
"in it as well. Certain political parties more than the others use protests to publicly"
"voice their criticism of policies and practices of the State. The primary objective of"
"a protest is to attract the attention of the authorities and the public at large, create"
"public  opinion  and  garner  support,  which  may  sometimes  result 
in  public"
"authorities 
responding 
to  demands  being  made  or  at 
least  entering 
into"
"discussions  with 
the  protesters  with 
the  view 
to  resolving  grievances  and"
"problems encountered by the protesters. As the immediate goal of protesters is to"
"attract attention, they choose public venues for the conduct of their protest. Often"
"people resort to protests when they perceive the lack or the absence of meaningful"
"responsiveness of the authorities to their  cause.  Public  protests, demonstrations"
"and associated public  meetings may  have a political undertone and may be the"
"outcome  of  political  stratagem.  Such  political  flavour  does  in  no  way  make  an"
"otherwise lawful protest, unlawful. It is not uncommon to observe policies of the"
"State  being  suspended,  reversed  or  varied  as  a  result  of  protests  which  are"
"sustained over a period of time and those that galvanize public support. Thus, the"
"potential of  protests and  demonstrations  being  efficacious tools of activism and"
"advocacy."
