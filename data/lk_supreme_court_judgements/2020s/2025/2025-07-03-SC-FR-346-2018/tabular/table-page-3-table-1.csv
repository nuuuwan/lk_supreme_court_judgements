"n insight into the Judgment"
"1.  On  6th  June  2018,  a  protest  took  place  at  the  Kalukele  junction  situated  on  the"
"Polonnaruwa  â€“  Mahiyanganaya  main  road.  Approximately  250  villagers  of  the"
"village  of  Kalukele  took  part,  protesting  against  the  inaction  on  the  part  of  the"
"authorities at preventing the invasion of their village and fields by wild elephants,"
"which was causing considerable hardships to them. The protest caused a complete"
"blockage  of  the  main  road  for  over  two  hours.  Admittedly,  the  two  Petitioners"
"participated  in  this  protest.  On  an  application  made  by  the  police,  the  learned"
"Magistrate issued an order under section 106 of the Code of Criminal Procedure"
"Act on two named individuals, requiring the discontinuation of the protest. The"
"two Petitioners claim that they were unaware of the order made by the learned"
"Magistrate and that in any event the order was not directed at them. On 18th June"
"2018, the two Petitioners along with another villager were arrested by officers of"
"the Aralaganwila Police Station in relation to committing certain offences relating"
"to this protest. That same day, they were remanded by the learned Magistrate of"
"Polonnaruwa. The Petitioners claim that the police acted unlawfully, and that the"
"arrest was an infringement of their fundamental rights. This Judgment examines"
"the lawfulness of the protest and the arrest of the two Petitioners and concludes"
"upon the disputed issues. The Judgment also contains an examination of the law"
"relating to the conduct of protests and demonstrations."
