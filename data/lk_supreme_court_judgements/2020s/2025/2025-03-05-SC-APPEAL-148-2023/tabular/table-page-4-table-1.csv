"(b) Did  the  Civil  Appeal  High  Court  err  in  law  by  overruling  the"
"preliminary objections of the appellant?"
"The judgment of the High Court is a well-considered judgment and there"
"is no necessity for me to repeat its contents here. The main point stressed"
"on behalf of the appellant in the pre-argument written submission filed"
"before this court is that there were no exceptional circumstances for the"
"High Court to invoke revisionary jurisdiction after a long delay from the"
"date of the ex parte judgment. I am not inclined to accept this argument"
"on several grounds."
"The purported ex parte judgment of the District Court, limited to three"
"simple sentences, does not constitute a judgment in the eyes of the law."
"It blatantly violates sections 85 and 187 of the Civil Procedure Code."
"More importantly, a final decree entered in a partition action cannot be"
"challenged collaterally. Section 48 of the Partition Law underscores the"
"finality  and  conclusiveness  of  partition  decrees  while  providing  limited"
"circumstances under which they may be challenged (Fernando v. Marsal"
"Appu (1922) 23 NLR 370, Mohamedaly Adamjee v. Hadad Sadeen (1956)"
"58  NLR  217,  Madurapperuma  v.  Wijesundara  [2019]  1  Sri  LR  512)."
"Additionally,  section  49  of  the  Partition  Law  allows  for  the  recovery  of"
"damages if there was a failure to name a person as a party to the action."
"In appropriate cases, the invocation of revisionary jurisdiction presents"
"another popular avenue for challenging partition decrees. The appellant"
"has  not  directly  challenged  the  partition  decree  through  any  of  these"
"methods."
