The plaintiff-Judgment Creditor-Respondent-Respondent-Appellant

(appellant) instituted this action in the District Court of Kalutara by

plaint dated 23.04.2010 against the 1st Defendant-Judgment Debtor-

Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (1st defendant respondent) and the

2nd Defendant-Judgment Debtor-Petitioner-Petitioner-Respondent (2nd

defendant respondent) seeking inter alia declarations (a) that he is

entitled to a share of the land described in the schedule to the plaint

including the boutique room bearing assessment No. 531 standing

thereon by Deed No. 1980 dated 04.10.1996, and (b) that Deed No. 1397

dated 13.02.2010, executed by the 1st defendant respondent in favour of

the 2nd defendant respondent, is a nullity. The 1st defendant respondent

filed answer seeking inter alia the dismissal of the plaintiffs action. The

2nd defendant respondent did not file answer and the case was fixed for

ex parte trial against him. The 1st defendant respondents source of title

originates from the final partition decree entered in 1994 in partition case

No. P/5880 filed in the same District Court. The appellant admitted this

in the plaint but contended that the final decree entered in the said

partition decree is a nullity, as it had been obtained fraudulently.

SC/APPEAL/148/2023

Halfway through the trial, the case was fixed for ex parte trial against the

1st defendant respondent as well. When the case came before the new

District Judge on 27.03.2014 for further ex parte trial, five lines of

evidence were led before the new Judge, who immediately thereafter

delivered the ex parte judgment dated 27.03.2014 granting all the reliefs

sought by the plaintiff in the prayer to the plaint with costs. The ex parte

judgment in this complicated case, where the plaintiff inter alia

challenges a partition decree, reads as follows:

.

.

. There can be no doubt that the District

Judge, rather than carefully examining the pleadings, issues raised, and

evidence led at the inter parte trial and ex parte trial, mechanically

entered decree for the plaintiff granting all the reliefs sought without even

considering the specific reliefs claimed by the appellant in the plaint.

Upon service of the ex parte decree, the defendant respondents made an

application to purge their default but this was rejected by the District

Judge by order dated 05.05.2016. Thereafter, the writ was executed on

16.10.2017. The defendant respondents filed an application before the

District Court seeking to recall the writ but this was also refused by the

District Judge by order dated 22.01.2018.

The 2nd defendant respondent then filed a revision application before the

High Court of Civil Appeal in Kalutara on 02.07.2018 seeking to set aside

the ex parte judgment of the District Court and the subsequent orders

made based on that ex parte judgment. After hearing both parties, by

judgment dated 10.12.2020, the High Court allowed the revision

application and dismissed the plaintiffs action. It is against this

judgment of the High Court that the appellant has come before this court.

This court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law:

4

SC/APPEAL/148/2023

(a) Did the Civil Appeal High Court err in law by granting relief under

section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code when purge default

applications of the defendant respondents were dismissed?

(b) Did the Civil Appeal High Court err in law by overruling the

preliminary objections of the appellant?

The judgment of the High Court is a well-considered judgment and there

is no necessity for me to repeat its contents here. The main point stressed

on behalf of the appellant in the pre-argument written submission filed

before this court is that there were no exceptional circumstances for the

High Court to invoke revisionary jurisdiction after a long delay from the

date of the ex parte judgment. I am not inclined to accept this argument

on several grounds.

The purported ex parte judgment of the District Court, limited to three

simple sentences, does not constitute a judgment in the eyes of the law.

It blatantly violates sections 85 and 187 of the Civil Procedure Code.

More importantly, a final decree entered in a partition action cannot be

challenged collaterally. Section 48 of the Partition Law underscores the

finality and conclusiveness of partition decrees while providing limited

circumstances under which they may be challenged (Fernando v. Marsal

Appu (1922) 23 NLR 370, Mohamedaly Adamjee v. Hadad Sadeen (1956)

58 NLR 217, Madurapperuma v. Wijesundara [2019] 1 Sri LR 512).

Additionally, section 49 of the Partition Law allows for the recovery of

damages if there was a failure to name a person as a party to the action.

In appropriate cases, the invocation of revisionary jurisdiction presents

another popular avenue for challenging partition decrees. The appellant

has not directly challenged the partition decree through any of these

methods.

5

SC/APPEAL/148/2023

The undivided rights which the appellant relies on through a Deed

executed two years after the final decree of partition cannot be recognised

in law, as those undivided rights were wiped out once the partition decree

was entered.

In this case, there was no inordinate delay, as the respondents had been

unsuccessfully trying to vindicate their rights in the District Court before

going to the High Court. Even if there was a delay, when there is a

manifest miscarriage of justice on the face of the record, the court cannot

turn a blind eye by stating that there was a delay. In the Supreme Court

Case of Biso Menika v. Cyril De Alwis [1982] 1 Sri LR 368 at 379,

Sharvanada J. (as he then was) stated that When the court has examined

the record and is satisfied the order complained of is manifestly erroneous

or without jurisdiction, the court would be loath to allow the mischief of the

order to continue and reject the application simply on the ground of delay,

unless there are very extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection.

I answer both questions of law in the negative. With regard to the first

question, I must further state that the High Court did not grant relief

under section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code but rather exercised its

revisionary powers to grant relief.

The judgment of the High Court is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed

with costs.
