The essen\u019fal dis\u019fnc\u019fon is between obliga\u019fons which come into existence upon the crea\u019fon of the banker-customer rela\u019fonship and obliga\u019fons which are subsequently assumed by speci\ufb01c agreement; or, from the standpoint of the customer, between services which a bank is obliged to provide if asked, and services which many bankers habitually do, but are not bound to, provide. Services such as banker\u2019s dra\u014cs, le\u01a9ers of credit and foreign currency for travel abroad probably fall into the second category of services which the bank is not bound to supply, but this has not been judicially determined.\u201d 5.

The customer on his part undertakes to exercise reasonable care in execu\u019fng his wri\u01a9en orders so as not to mislead the bank or to facilitate forgery. \u201d 6. Much has changed over the last hundred years since Atkin, J\u2019s above statement. Today, a customer need not visit the bank, leave alone the branch where he or she maintains an account but can request payment and other services from his bank at any \u019fme and from any loca\u019fon. While the signi\ufb01cance of banks in modern market economies cannot be underes\u019fmated, the rela\u019fonship between the bank and the customer has remained much the same with the opening of an account with the bank being the crucial element in establishing the rela\u019fonship between the bank and the customer. One must however bear in mind that banks do o\ufb00er general \ufb01nancial services to non-account holders, thus giving rise to a rela\u019fonship between the bank and such customer where such services are provided. 7. Thus, in terms of the bank \u2013 customer rela\u019fonship that existed between the Plain\u019f\ufb00 and the Defendant, the Plain\u019f\ufb00 was en\u019ftled to withdraw funds that were available in his rupee denominated current and/or savings account at the Defendant. It is admi\u01a9ed that the Plain\u019f\ufb00 did not have a foreign currency denominated account at the Defendant and therefore any issuance of foreign currency to the Plain\u019f\ufb00 was outside the general contract referred to by Paget. That being so, the Plain\u019f\ufb00 was not en\u019ftled to obtain foreign currency as of right, with the provisions of the Exchange Control Act being applicable with regard to the issuance of foreign currency to the Plain\u019f\ufb00.
