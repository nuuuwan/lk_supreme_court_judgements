SC/APPEAL/38/2011

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant in the District

Court of Attanagalle seeking a declaration that she is a co-owner of the land

described in the schedule to the plaint, the ejectment of the defendant

therefrom, and damages. The dispute primarily concerns the defendants

use of a right of way over the plaintiffs land, which the plaintiff contends

he is not entitled to.

In his answer, the defendant sought a declaration that he is entitled to a

servitude of an eight-foot right of way over the plaintiffs land by

prescription. He also claimed a fifteen-foot right of way by way of necessity.

After trial, the District Court entered judgment in favour of the defendant

holding that he is entitled to a ten-foot right of way over the plaintiffs land

by prescription.

On appeal, the High Court set aside the judgment of the District Court and

entered judgment for the plaintiff as prayed for in the plaint. The defendant

now appeals against the judgment of the High Court.

The defendant resides on the land situated to the south of the plaintiffs

land. The defendants land was subject to partition in Partition Case No.

18815/P in the District Court of Gampaha. The final partition decree dated

04.08.1986 was marked as P8, and the corresponding final partition plan

was marked as P8.

On 15.10.1999, the defendant purchased Lot 1 of the said final partition

plan by deed marked P7. The plaintiff instituted this action on 18.04.2002.

As evidenced by Commission Plan No. 1552, which was prepared for the

purpose of this case and marked as P9, Lot 1 forms the southern boundary

of the plaintiffs land.

SC/APPEAL/38/2011

The plaintiff asserts that she and her family have been residing on the land

situated to the north of Lot 1 for an extended period. Following the untimely

demise of her husband on 05.11.1998, she temporarily moved to her

parents house with her two young children. During this period, the

defendant, for his convenience, began using a roadway over her land,

despite the existence of a clearly demarcated ten-foot right of wayLot 11

of the final partition planproviding access from Lot 1 to the main road.

The defendants position is that he has been living in the house on Lot 2 of

the final partition plan since 1989 and has been using this road over the

plaintiffs land throughout. To put it simply, Lot 1 forms the southern

boundary of the plaintiffs land, and Lot 2 forms the southern boundary of

Lot 1. The defendant asserts that from his house on Lot 2, he has been

using a right of way through Lot 1 and the plaintiffs land.

The deed by which the defendant claims title to Lot 2 was marked V2. This

deed was executed on 25.03.1989 after the aforementioned partition decree

by the allottees of Lot 2. However, in the deed, the said allottees do not refer

to the partition decree at all. Instead, they have transferred their undivided

rights, tracing their title to a deed executed in 1940. This is intriguing.

Nevertheless, there is no need to examine this matter in the present appeal,

as there is no dispute over Lot 2. What must be emphasized is that, after

entering the partition decree, all prior deeds cease to have validity.

Furthermore, with the partition decree, any pre-existing roads across the

defendants land were extinguished, and a new access roadLot 11was

created. The final partition plan does not indicate any road access

northward from Lot 1. Instead, the public road is depicted on the eastern

side of the larger land. The court commissioner, in Plan No. 1552, has

identified this public road as the Pradeshiya Sabha road (see note 5 of that

plan). Accordingly, the defendants contention that he and their

4

SC/APPEAL/38/2011

predecessors in title have been using a roadway over the plaintiffs land for

more than 60 years is untenable.

I have no reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court. The

defendant-appellant raised the following question of law before this Court:

In the circumstances pleaded, is the judgment of the High Court according to

law and according to the evidence adduced in the case?. I answer the said

question of law in the affirmative. There is no necessity to answer the other

questions of law. I affirm the judgment of the High Court and dismiss the

appeal with costs.
