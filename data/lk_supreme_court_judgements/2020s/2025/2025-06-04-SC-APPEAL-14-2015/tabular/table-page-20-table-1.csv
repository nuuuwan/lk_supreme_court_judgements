"S.C. Appeal No. 14/2015"
"which  had  the  greatest  number  of  stab  injuries,  coupled  with  the  evidence  of"
"subsequent conduct of the accused, particularly of the 1st accused."
"The Court of Appeal considered the contention, presented before it by the"
"learned President’s Counsel for the 3rd accused that he did not share a common"
"murderous  intention  with  the  other  two  accused.  It appears  from  the  judgment"
"of  that  Court  that  neither  the  1st  and  2nd  accused  have  presented  a  ground  of"
"appeal  based  on  common  intention  nor  raised  same  in  their  joint  petition  of"
"appeal. In relation to the 1st and 3rd accused, the only ground considered by that"
"Court  was 
the  correctness  of 
the  assessment  made  by 
the  High  Court  on"
"testimonial trustworthiness of Piyadasa."
"In view of the questions of law on which this appeal was argued on, it is"
"necessary to devote some space in this judgment to consider this aspect in a more"
"detailed manner."
"The evidence is clear that there was some animosity entertained by the 1st"
"and 2nd accused against the deceased and his father. Judging by their conduct, it"
"supports  an  inference  that  the  said  animosity  was  directed  mostly  towards  the"
"deceased.  Having  had  the  opportunity  to  cause  bodily  harm  to  Piyadasa  inside"
"his  shop, 
the  1st  and  2nd  accused  have  resisted 
that 
temptation  and  have"
"withdrawn  after  issuing  only  death  threats.  When  the  deceased  returned  home"
"after  about  half  an  hour  later,  the  situation  changed  drastically.  Instead  of  the"
"two accused, who came earlier on, the 3rd accused also joined them, in search of"
"the deceased after seeing him returning home."
"It  was  the  3rd  accused  who  called  out  for  the  deceased  “u,a,S""  u,a,S”  and"
"lured  the  latter out  of his house. Then the attack on him commenced without  a"
"warning  and 
the  deceased  cried 
“nqÿ  wïfu`”.  The  1st  and  2nd  accused  have"
"20"
