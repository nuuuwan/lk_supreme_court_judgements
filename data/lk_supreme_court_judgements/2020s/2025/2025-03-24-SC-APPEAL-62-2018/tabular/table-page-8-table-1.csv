"Section 9 of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 vested original criminal jurisdiction in the"
"High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka. Admiralty jurisdiction was vested by Section 13 of"
"the said Act. Section 18 vested the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka with power and"
"authority to take cognizance of and try in a summary manner any offence of contempt"
"committed against or in disrespect of its authority."
"The High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka as constituted in 1978 by the Constitution was"
"only a Court of First Instance. Article 111(1) of the Constitution was amended by the 11th"
"Amendment to the Constitution in 1987 by substituting therefore a new sub-article which"
"provided  that  “There  shall  be  a  High  Court  of  Sri  Lanka  which  shall  exercise  such"
"jurisdiction  and  powers  as  Parliament  may  by  law  vest  or  ordain.”  The  object  of  this"
"amendment appears to be to divest the High Court of Sri Lanka and its character as a Court"
"of First Instance exercising criminal jurisdiction and enabling Parliament to vest appellate"
"and revisionary jurisdiction in the High Court of Sri Lanka."
"The amendment to Article 111(1) made in 1987  paved the way for Parliament to vest,"
"appellate, revisionary and writ jurisdiction in the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka"
"by the 13th Amendment."
"High Court of the Province"
"Article  154P(1)  of  the  Constitution  provided  that  there  shall  be  a  High  Court  for  each"
"Province  with  effect  from  the  date  on  which  the  13th  Amendment  to  the  Constitution"
"comes into force. Each such High Court is designated as the High Court of the relevant"
"Province."
"One question that arises at the outset, is whether the High Court of the Republic of Sri"
"Lanka, the High Court of Sri Lanka and the High Court of the Province is one and the same"
"Court.  In  Sriyawathie  v.  Superintendent,  Hapugastenne  Estate  and  Others  [(1997)  1"
"Sri.L.R. 1] it was held that the Court referred to in Articles 105(1)(c), 111 (1) and 154P(2)"
