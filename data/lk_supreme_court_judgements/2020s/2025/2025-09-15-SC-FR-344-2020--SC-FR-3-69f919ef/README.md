ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 15-09-2025

P. PADMAN SURASENA, CJ

The learned Counsel for both parties agree that Court can consolidate all these cases

and conduct one hearing in respect of all of them. They also agree that it would

suffice for this Court to pronounce one Judgment in respect of all these cases i.e.

SC/FR/344/2020, SC/FR/345/2020, SC/FR/346/2020, SC/FR/347/2020,

SC/FR/348/2020 and SC/FR/349/2020.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner and also the

submissions of the learned Counsel for the Respondents and concluded the argument

of this case.

According to the Petition, the Petitioner has joined the State Engineering Corporation

of Sri Lanka in the year 1999 as a Security Officer (Casual). Thereafter, by the letter

dated 09-03-2006 (P2 and P3) he was promoted to the Post of Clerk Grade XIII while

being absorbed in to the permanent carder of the Corporation.

Thereafter, by the letter dated 30-10-2009 (P4), the Petitioner was appointed to the

Post of Management Assistant Grade III of the Corporation with effect from 01-11-

[SC/FR/344/2020, SC/FR/345/2020, SC/FR/346/2020, SC/FR/347/2020, SC/FR/348/2020 &

SC/FR/349/2020]

Page 19 of 20 2009. Thereafter, the Petitioner was promoted to the Post of Management Assistant

Class II of Grade III of the Corporation by the letter dated 11-08-2010 (P5).

Subsequently, by the letter dated 16-05-2006, the Petitioner was again promoted to

the Post of Administrative Officer Grade III of the Corporation (P6).

Admittedly, the Petitioner was engaged in active Politics for a specified Political Party

while working as a Committee Member for a specified Trade Union of the Corporation.

(Vide paragraph 19 of the Petition dated 16-12-2020)

Petitioner in his Petition has also admitted having being engaged in political activities

in the Country from time to time.

In the instant case, the Petitioner has challenged the documents marked P8 and P23.

By P8, the 1st Respondent has transferred the Petitioner to another station in Ekala.

This transfer was based on the document marked P23.

The Petitioner has presented this case on the basis that the Respondents have effected

the impugned transfer for political reasons. However, we observe that no document

produced by the Petitioner has successfully established this assertion before us.

The minute made on P23 is by an official. There is no indication whatsoever that the

discussion referred to in that minute has been made for political reasons. The transfer

of the Petitioner has been effected on this decision.

The learned Counsel for the Respondents has taken up the position that the Petitioner

having joined as a Security Officer (Casual) has unduly raised himself up to the position

of Administrative Officer Grade III of the 1st Respondent Corporation purely due to

political affiliations the Petitioner has had with the afore-said specified Political Party.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent submits that this has happened in total

disregard to the accepted Scheme of Recruitment.

[SC/FR/344/2020, SC/FR/345/2020, SC/FR/346/2020, SC/FR/347/2020, SC/FR/348/2020 &

SC/FR/349/2020]

Page 20 of 20

Indeed, we observe that the document marked R4 has shed some light on this.

According to R4, the 1st Respondent Corporation has informed the Petitioner that it is

in the process of conducting an Inquiry to ascertain whether the Petitioner has

necessary qualifications to hold the Post he is currently holding.

In the above circumstances, we are unable to agree with the submissions of the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the transfer of the Petitioner effected as per

P8 has been done by the Respondents illegally, unlawfully, arbitrarily, capriciously or

unreasonably as claimed by the Petitioner.

For the above reasons, we hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to succeed with this

Petition.

Therefore, we decide to dismiss this case without costs.

The issue in the other cases are the same. Therefore, this Judgment must apply to all

the other cases and all the other cases, i.e. SC/FR/344/2020, SC/FR/345/2020,

SC/FR/346/2020, SC/FR/347/2020, SC/FR/348/2020 & SC/FR/349/2020 must stand

dismissed without costs.
