"S.C. Appeal No.89/2024"
"Mark Fernando J, delivering judgment in Wijayapala Mendis v Perera and"
"Others  (ibid),  in  relation  to  an  instance  where  a  similar  objection  was  taken  in"
"respect  of  an  application  seeking  a  Writ  against  a  recommendation  made  by  a"
"Special Presidential Commission, held that (at p. 162) that  “[T]he application now"
"before us is a legitimate invocation of the jurisdiction of this Court to review the findings"
"and  recommendations  of  the  Commission; 
it  seeks  relief  only 
in  an  area 
in  which"
"Parliament  has  no 
jurisdiction,  and 
it  seeks  no  order  or  relief 
in  respect  of  what"
"Parliament has done or may do”.  His Lordship held that view after distinguishing"
"the  matter  before  that  Court,  with  the  facts  of  the  case  of  Bandaranaike  v"
"Weeraratne  and  Others  (supra),  as  in  that  instance,  by  the  time  the  application"
"was  taken  up  for  hearing  before  Court,  the  Parliament  had  already  passed  the"
"resolution  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Commission,  unlike  in  the"
"situation presented in Wijayapala Mendis v Perera and Others (ibid)."
