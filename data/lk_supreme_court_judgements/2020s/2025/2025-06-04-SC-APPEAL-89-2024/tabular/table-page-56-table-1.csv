"and  to  award  adequate  compensation,  if  it  was  found  that  the  allegation  is"
"substantiated."
"There cannot be any dispute over the contention of the Plaintiff that she is"
"entitled to the full enjoyment of the bundle of rights conferred on her under the"
"common 
law, 
in  addition 
to  her  entitlement 
to 
the  rights  conferred  under"
"Chapters III and IV of the Constitution, described therein as fundamental rights"
"and  language  rights.  However,  as  a  consequence  of  the  said  contention,  the"
"nature  of 
the  dispute  presented  before 
this  Court 
is  slightly  modified  and"
"therefore  should  be  described  as,  whether  the  instant  action  instituted  by  the"
"Plaintiff,  on 
the  basis  of  a  violation 
to  her  common 
law  rights,  could  be"

interdict  her  and  to  place  her  on  compulsory 
leave  only"
"resulted  in  a  “delictual  wrong”,  when  it  interrupted  her  career  progression.  The"
"legal  validity  of  that  complaint  was  examined  in  the  preceding  part  of  this"
"judgment  and  I  have  already  arrived  at  the  conclusion  that  it  was  not  due  to"
"actions  and  decisions  of  the  Defendants,  but due  to the  “decisions”  or  “orders”"
"made by the PSC that resulted in the said interruption to her career progression,"
"if any."
"What  Article  61A  deprives  the  District  Court  is,  its  jurisdiction  to  “  …"
"inquire into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call in question any order or decision"
"made by the Commission, …”. It is relevant to note in this context that the Plaintiff"
"did  not  make  any  allegation  that  the  PSC  has  acted  mala  fide  in  arriving  at  the"
