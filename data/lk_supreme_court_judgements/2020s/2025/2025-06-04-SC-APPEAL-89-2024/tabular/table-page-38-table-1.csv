"fide, 
during  the  process  within  which  they  have  allegedly  acted  with  “mala"
"maliciously and illegally” and thereby committing a “delictual wrong”."
"The  formula  relied  on  by  the  learned  Counsel  in  order  to  impress  upon"
"this  Court  of  the  proposition  that  the  individual  decision  so  arrived  at  by  each"
"member “is only a part of the causal chain”, is as follows:"
"i. 
Defendants act maliciously,"
"ii. 
Consequent to that malicious action, decisions are made,"
"iii. 
Consequent to the decisions, the Plaintiff suffers damages."
"Since this equation deals with the important phases of the decision-making"
"process  by  which  each  of  the  Defendants,  being  members  of  the  PSC,  said  to"
"have  arrived  at  their  respective  individual  decisions  with  minds  tainted  with"
"malice,  it  is  pertinent to examine  the  nature  and  scope  of  the  powers  conferred"
"on the PSC, in relation to the Plaintiff, as the first step and the manner in which it"
"is expected to exercise such powers as the second step."
"But  before  proceeding  to  the  first  step  in  the  said  process,  it  is  of  great"
"relevance  to  make  at 
least  a  passing  reference  to  a  factor  that  the 
learned"
"President’s Counsel for the 2nd Defendant, thought it fit to invite our attention."
"Paragraph 31 of the Plaint, in which the Plaintiff sets out her complaint to"
"the original Court, reads as follows:"
"“[T]he  Plaintiff  states  that  the  Defendants  by  interdicting  the  Plaintiff"
"and/or  interdicting  the  Plaintiff  without  pay  and/or  paying  the  Plaintiff"
"half salary and/or placing the Plaintiff on Compulsory Leave, jointly and/or"
