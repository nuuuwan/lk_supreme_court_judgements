"S.C. Appeal No.89/2024"
"confer  any  ‘immunity’  on  the  PSC  as  such,  but  only  imposes  a  Constitutional"
"ouster of jurisdiction of Courts to adjudicate upon its decisions and orders which"
"was sought to be achieved by taking away the jurisdiction already conferred by"
"law on  such  Courts.  If  it was  the  intention  the  draftsmen  of  the  Constitution  to"
"indicate that Article 61A meant to confer immunity on the PSC, they could have"
"used the marginal note as they used in Article 35, namely, “[I]mmunity of … from"
"suit” (“úreoaOj kvq mejrsh fkdyels nj”) in that Article as well, instead of the marginal"
"note that has commonly been used in respect of other public institutions referred"
"to above conferring with only an ouster of jurisdiction."
