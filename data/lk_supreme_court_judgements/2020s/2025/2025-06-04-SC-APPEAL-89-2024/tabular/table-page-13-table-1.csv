"S.C. Appeal No.89/2024"
"Court  in  terms  of  Article  105(2),  the  Parliament  could  abolish  its  powers  by"
"enacting legislation to that effect, which it did in enacting Article 61A."
"Learned President’s Counsel for the 5th Defendant particularly invited our"
"attention to the decision-making process of the PSC as set out in Article 61, as the"
"learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  2nd  Defendant  did,  and  stressed  upon  the"
"point that the decisions of the PSC are taken, only if the members vote either in"
"unanimity,  or  by  majority  and,  with  a  casting  vote  by  Chairman  of  the  PSC,  in"
"case  of  equal  votes.  This  was  highlighted  to  impress  upon  the  fact  that  any"
"individual  decision  of  the  membership  could  not  be  considered  as  “order”  or  a"
"“decision” of the PSC. He further submitted that the attempt made by the Plaintiff"
"to  question  the  “orders”  or  “decisions”  of  the  PSC  through  the  instant  action  is"
"clearly an instance where she tries to do something which she cannot do directly,"
"but by indirect means."
"Having referred to the gist of the contentions in the preceding paragraphs"
"that  were  presented  by  Counsel,  over  the  description  that  ought  to  be  given  to"
"Article  61A,  it  is  proposed  to commence  the  examination  of  these,  commencing"
"with  a  detailed  description  of  the  primary  contention  presented  by  the  learned"
"President’s  Counsel  for  the  Plaintiff  during  the  hearing  of  these  consolidated"
"appeals."
"Learned President’s Counsel for the Plaintiff contended that, generally the"
"nature  of  an  immunity conferred  by  a  statue  could  be  divided  into  two  classes."
"Then  he  cited  the  instances  of  conferring  “absolute  immunity”  and  instances  of"
"conferring “qualified immunity” in support of that contention. It was pointed out"
"that certain categories of persons enjoy “absolute immunity” for life, in respect of"
"certain categories of acts/omissions.  The utterances and the acts of the Members"
