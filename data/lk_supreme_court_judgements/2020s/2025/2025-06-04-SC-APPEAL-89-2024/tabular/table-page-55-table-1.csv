"S.C. Appeal No.89/2024"
"members of the PSC have no impact on the career of a public officer since it is the"
"unanimous  or  majority  “decision”  of  the  PSC  only  that  would  make  an  impact."
"This  is  because  only  the  PSC,  being  the  body  that  conferred  with  powers  to"
"determine the appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control over the"
"public service, could make an “order” or a “decision” on any of these matters on"
"an individual public officer."
