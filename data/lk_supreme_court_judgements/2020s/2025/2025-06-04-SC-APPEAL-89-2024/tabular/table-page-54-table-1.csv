"S.C. Appeal No.89/2024"
"has  no  jurisdiction  to  inquire  into  or  pronounce  upon  or  in  any  manner  call  in"
"question any such order or decision."
"The  District  Court,  after  an 
inquiry 
into 
the  objection  raised  on 
its"
"jurisdiction, made an order rejecting the said objection. The rejection of the said"
"objection was  primarily made on the footing that no “immunity”, as conferred on"
"the  President  of 
the  Republic  or  on 
the  members  of 
the 
Judicial  Service"
"Commission,  was  conferred  on  any  of  the  members  of  the  PSC  and,  since  the"
"“immunity”  conferred  on  the  members  of  the  Election  Commission  is  limited  to"
"the acts done in good faith, in this instance too, an action could be instituted and"
"maintained  against  the  Defendants,  when  the  cause  of  action  against  them  is"
"founded  on  breach  of  duty  of  care,  for  acting  negligently,  wrongly,  illegally,  in"
"excess of powers, and mala fide."
"The  Defendants  have  thereupon  moved  the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeal"
"and sought its leave, in order to appeal against the said order. That Court, while"
"granting leave, also permitted the action of the Plaintiff, that was pending before"
"the  District  Court 
to  proceed  with, 
in 
terms  of  Section  757(5)  of 
the  Civil"
"Procedure Code."
"Since the answer to the question of law, upon which the two appeals were"
"argued, namely “Can the Plaintiff have maintained this action, in view of Article"
"61A  of  the  Constitution  ?”  will  itself  determine  the  legal  validity  of  these  two"
"orders, I shall therefore proceed to determine the said question of law."
"It  has  already  been  decided  that  the  Article  61A  acts  as  a  Constitutional"
"ouster of jurisdiction of the Courts and tribunals, barring the jurisdiction of this"
"Court  conferred  under  Article  126,  and 
that 
the  actions  of 
the 
individual"
"54"
