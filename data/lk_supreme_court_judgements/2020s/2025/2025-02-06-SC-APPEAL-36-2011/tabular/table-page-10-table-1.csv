"the plaintiff has denied and taken up a position that it relates to the transaction"
"in the present case. In reply, the defendants have amended a clerical error but"
"has  not  withdrawn  his  position  in  the  original  letter  of  demand.  Further,  it"
"should be well noted that, the defendants have filed their answer denying the"
"position in the plaint. Additionally, no suggestion has been made to record an"
"admission when issues were raised, neither was an issue raised proposing that"
"this letter has to be treated as an admission."
"30.  Thus,  in  the  circumstances  of  this  case,  it  is  not  reasonable  to  consider  the"
"failure to reply or in other words failure to deny the contents of the reply to the"
"letter of demand, as an admission. One cannot expect a party to reply to letters"
"when  the  case  is  pending  before  the  Court.  It  is  my  position  that  it  is  not"
"suitable to presume it as an admission when the defendants have stated their"
"position in the original letter of demand and the answer."
"31.  When  considering  the  questions  of  law  on  which  leave  to  appeal  has  been"
"granted, I will first address the question of law (6) set out in paragraph 13 of"
"the petition."
"In any event, did the learned High Court Judge err in holding that, there"
"was evidence to show that the impugned deed is a fraudulent deed?"
