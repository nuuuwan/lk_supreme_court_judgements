"34.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  plaintiff  (respondent),  in  his  written",""
"","submissions  submitted  that,  a  property  in  an  extent  of  10  acres  had  been"

"","President’s Counsel had also made submissions with regard to the minority of"
"","the 2nd defendant and on how the notary public who attested the deed has not"
"","acted in compliance with the provisions of the Notaries Ordinance."
"35.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  plaintiff  in  his  written  submissions",""
"","submitted further that, the transferee in the deed bearing No. 167 [P-1] who is"
"","the son of the 1st defendant was a minor and was still schooling at the time of"
