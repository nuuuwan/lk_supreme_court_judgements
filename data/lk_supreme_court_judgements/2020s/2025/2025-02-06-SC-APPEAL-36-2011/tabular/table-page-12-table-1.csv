"","plaintiff would willingly hand over the original deeds to the defendants. This"
"","acts  as  another  vital  circumstance  which  supports  the  defendants’  position"
"","that it is not a fraudulent deed."
"39.  Apart  from  this,  it  is  also  accepted  by  the  plaintiff  that  he  had  placed  his",""
"","signature on a transfer deed which he  claimed was unfilled. Regardless of it"
"","being  filled  or  unfilled,  there  is  nothing  to  show  that  the  plaintiff  was  an"
"","illiterate  person.  Therefore,  plaintiff  in  placing  his  signature  on  a  piece  of"
"","document titled transfer deed cannot thereafter take the position that he was"
"","helpless especially in an instance where the circumstances of the case are not"
"","in his favour."
"40.  When  addressing  the  issue  of  minority  of  the  2nd  defendant  to  whom  the  1st",""
"","defendant had transferred the property in dispute, it was stated in the case of"
"","Palipane V. Palipane and Others [2003] 2 S.L.R. 262 that,"
"","“
In Fernando v Fernando  Ennis, J and Schneider, J decided that a minor's"
"","deed  was  not  absolutely  void  and  might  be  ratified  by  the  minor  when  he"
"","attained  majority.  In  that  case  Ennis,  J  also  expressed  the  opinion  that  the"
"","distinction  between  void  and  voidable  made  by  the  latter  day  jurists  was  not"
"","clear in the Roman Dutch text books."
"","… .Whenever a minor obtained a benefit from the contract there was no complete"
"","prohibition and whether or not he obtained a benefit was a question of fact. In"
"","the  case  of  donation  and  suretyship  it  was  considered  that  absence  of  any"
"","benefit by a minor was manifest and the contract was considered to be void ab"
"","initio or prohibition being absolute. In the case of a loan there was some doubt"
"","throwing the onus of proof on the minor to show that he received no benefit. Thus"
"","it appears that in every case except gift or suretyship the contract was in fact"
"","voidable  and  not  void  but  as  there  was  no  word  for  voidable  the  idea  was"
"","expressed  by  using  the  word  void  with  illustration  showing  that  the  contract"
"","could be made void at a future time at the option of the minor.”"
"41.","In this case, although the 2nd defendant (the minor) has attained majority, he"
"","has never ratified or repudiated the deed in question. In this instance, the 2nd"
"","defendant (minor) has benefitted from the deed  in question. Further, he has"
"","also continued to defend his right in this case after attaining majority."
"42.  When considering the issue on the fraudulent nature of the deed, I do not see",""
"","any grounds to support the decision of the learned Judges of the High Court."
