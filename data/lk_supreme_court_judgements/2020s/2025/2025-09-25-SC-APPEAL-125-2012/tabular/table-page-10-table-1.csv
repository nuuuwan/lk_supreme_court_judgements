"schedule C of the plaint, which was Lot 4B of the final partition plan marked"
"P-02."
"He also submitted that the defendants who have claimed prescriptive title to"
"the land depicted in schedule B of the plaint have failed to establish their title,"
"and hence, the title established by the plaintiffs should prevail."
"In reply to a question raised by the Court during the hearing of this appeal,"
"the learned President’s Counsel was of the view that it is not necessary always"
"to obtain the services of a surveyor and to show the land in dispute in relation"
"to a commission obtained through the Court in a rei vindicatio action. It was"
"contended that since the plaintiffs have described the land with its metes and"
"bounds and also by way of a final partition plan, there was no difficulty for"
"the trial Court to identify the subject matter of the action. It was submitted"
"further that the Court of Appeal erred in its determinations, and had failed to"
"consider the evidence placed before the trial Court and the judgment of the"
"learned District Judge in its correct perspective, when it was determined that"
"the plaintiffs had failed to establish their title as claimed before the trial Court."
"It  was  the  position  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  who  represented  the"
"defendants that it has been established before the trial Court that the portion"
"South of the road that runs through Lot 4 of the final partition plan marked"
"P-02, had been sold to the predecessor in title of the defendants by Punchi"
"Banda, who was the person who became entitled to the said portion by the"
"partition decree. It was also pointed out that it was undisputed that Lot 4A of"
"the final partition plan is also held and possessed by the defendants, while"
"the trial Court held that Lot 4B, though claimed by the plaintiffs, was held"
"and possessed by the defendants."
"It  was  the  position  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  that  the  disputed"
"portion referred to in schedule B of the plaint was also held and possessed by"
"the predecessors of the defendants and the defendants through title deeds as"
"pleaded  by  them.  It  was  contended  that  they  have  established  prescriptive"
"title  as  well  to  the  said  portion  by  holding  and  possessing  the  said  portion"
"along with the balance portion of Lot 4, Lot 4A, and Lot 4B as one single entity."
