the  said  deed.  However, 
the 
fact  remains 
that

"When it comes to the facts and the circumstances specific to the case under",""

"It is also clear from the evidence that the two plots of land mentioned as Lot",""

"Because of such a possession, it is reasonable to assume that there would not",""

"of  Lot  4  which  they  have  described  as  the  Northern  portion  of  the  said  Lot",""
"separated by a road that runs through  the said land, it was paramount on",""
"them to identify the land claimed for which they are seeking a declaration of",""
"title through a survey plan obtained for the purposes of the action.",""
"This is so necessary due to the fact of the defendants’ claim of title to the said",""
"Lot along with the lands adjacent to the disputed portion.",""
