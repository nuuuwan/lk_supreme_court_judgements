"It was held in the case of D.A. Wanigaratne Vs. Juwanis Appuhamy 65 NLR"
"167 at 168;"
"“It had been laid down now by this Court that in an action rei vindicatio"
"the  plaintiff  should  set  out  his  title  on  the  basis  on  which  he  claims  a"
"declaration  of  title  to  the  land  and  must,  in  Court,  prove  that  the  title"
"against  the  defendant  in  the  action.  The  defendant  in  a  rei  vindicatio"
"action  need  not  prove  anything,  still  less,  his  own  title.  The  plaintiff"
"cannot ask for a declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength"
"that  the  defendant’s  title  is  poor  or  not  established.  The  plaintiff  must"
"prove and establish his title.”"
