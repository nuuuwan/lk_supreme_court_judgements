"4B of the final partition plan. The said Lot 4B is the land described in schedule"
"C of the plaint."
"While determining that the defendants have also failed to establish the title"
"as claimed by them in relation to the said Lot 4 of the final partition plan, it"
"has been determined that they have established title with regard to Lot 4B."
"On  the  said  basis,  the  learned  District  Judge  has  answered  the  issues  in"
"favour of the plaintiffs in relation to schedule B of the plaint, while allowing"
"damages  and  also  ejectment  of  the  defendants  from  the  said  portion  of  the"
"land."
"Being  aggrieved  of  the  said  judgment,  the  defendants  have  appealed  to  the"
"Court of Appeal."
"The Court of Appeal, of its judgment dated 17-12-2010, has determined that"
"the  action  before  the  District  Court  being  a  rei  vindicatio  action,  it  was"
"paramount on the plaintiffs to prove their title. It has been determined that"
"since  the  plaintiffs  did  not  have  documentary  title,  it  was  incumbent  upon"
"them to prove the prescriptive title as claimed by them, however, they have"
"failed to establish any documentary or prescriptive title to the lands claimed"
"by them. It has also been determined that the learned trial Judge has placed"
"an unnecessary burden on the defendants to prove their title and had failed"
"to consider whether the plaintiffs have proved their title as claimed by them."
"Holding  that  the  learned  trial  Judge  has  misconstrued  the  principles  in"
"relation to a rei vindicatio action, the judgment of the learned District Judge"
"has been set aside and the appeal has been allowed."
"At  the  hearing  of  this  appeal,  it  was  the  position  of  the  learned  President’s"
"Counsel who represented the 2nd plaintiff, who is the appellant in this case,"
"that  the  plaintiffs  have  properly  identified  the  subject  matter  of  this  action"
"and have also pleaded their title to the satisfaction of the Court."
"However, the learned President’s Counsel intimated to the Court that he will"
"not  challenge  the  determination  of  the  learned  District  Judge  where  it  was"
"held that the plaintiffs have failed to prove their title to the land described in"
