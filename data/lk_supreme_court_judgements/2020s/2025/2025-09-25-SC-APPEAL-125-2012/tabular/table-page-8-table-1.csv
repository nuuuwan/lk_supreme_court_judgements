"The  earlier  mentioned  plan  has  been  marked  and  produced  as  P-02  at  the"
"trial (page 212 of the appeal brief), which is the final partition plan prepared"
"for the purposes of the District Court of Kurunegala Partition Action No. 230."
"According to the final partition decree marked P-01, the said Lot 4 as depicted"
"in  schedule  A  of  the  plaint  has  been  allocated  to  the  3rd  defendant  of  the"
"action,  one  Punchi  Banda,  while  Lot  4B,  which  is  the  land  depicted  in"
"schedule C of the plaint, has been allocated to the 12th defendant of the action,"
"one Kirimenika. It has been the position of the plaintiffs that the said Punchi"
"Banda, to whom they have referred to as Punchi Banda Subasinghe, sold the"
"portion of the land South to the road that runs through Lot 4, and he was in"
"possession  of  the  balance  portion  of  Lot  4,  which  was  to  the  North  of  the"
"earlier mentioned road."
"The  plaintiffs  have  claimed  that  the  said  portion  of  the  land  was  held  and"
"possessed by the earlier mentioned Punchi Banda Subasinghe, and upon his"
"death, his son Premachandra held and possessed the said portion of the land"
"along with Lot No. 4B of the final partition plan, and established prescriptive"
"title to the said two portions of the land. The plaintiffs have raised their issues"
"on  the  basis  that  upon  the  death  of  said  Premachandra  Subasinghe,  the"
"plaintiffs inherited the said portions of the land and established prescriptive"
"title as well."
"It  was  on  the  basis  that  the  defendants  forcibly  evicted  the  plaintiffs  on  or"
"about 28-10-1993, which resulted in accruing a cause of action for them to"
"get a declaration of title and ejectment of the defendants, as well as damages,"
"the plaintiffs have initiated action before the District Court."
"Although the defendants have only claimed for a dismissal of the action, they"
"have also raised their issues based on several  title  deeds as stated in their"
"pleadings and have also raised an issue on the basis of Res Judicata."
"The learned District Judge in her judgment has determined that the plaintiffs"
"have established their title to the portion of land described in schedule B of"
"the plaint, while determining that they have failed to establish the title to Lot"
