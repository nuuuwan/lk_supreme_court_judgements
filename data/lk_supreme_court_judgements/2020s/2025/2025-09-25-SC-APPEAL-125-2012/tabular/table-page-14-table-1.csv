"If  they  were  indeed  brothers  as  it  appears,  contrary  to  the  claim  by  the"
"plaintiffs that they are father and son, the plaintiffs’ title pleaded based on"
"inheritance shall fail since they have failed to establish the inheritance they"
"claimed."
"It is my considered view that in a rei vindicatio action, proving of title to the"
"subject matter of an action includes the proper identification of the land for"
"which a plaintiff is claiming title."
"I am in agreement with the submissions of the learned President’s Counsel"
"on behalf of the 2nd plaintiff, that in terms of Section 41 of the Civil Procedure"
"Code, when a claim is made in an action for some specific part of a land or"
"some share or interest in a specific portion of land, then the portion of land"
"must  be  described  in  the  plaint  so  far  as  possible  by  reference  to  physical"
"metes  and  bounds  or  by  reference  to  a  sufficient  sketch,  map  or    plan"
"appended to the plaint and not by name only."
"However, it is also my view that whether stating as such in a plaint would be"
"sufficient to succeed in an action in the nature of a rei vindicatio would depend"
"on facts and circumstances specific to each case."
"The case under appeal is a matter where there has been no admission as to"
"the corpus. It is true that the plaintiffs have described the land in question in"
"relation to a final partition plan that was prepared in the year 1942. The plaint"
"in this action has been filed in the year 1993, more than five decades after the"
"final partition plan was prepared."
"The  plaintiffs  have  claimed  not  the  entire  Lot  4  of  the  final  partition  plan"
"marked P-02, but only the Northern portion separated through a road running"
"through the Lot 4. The evidence placed before the Court has established the"
"fact  that  the  Southern  portion  of  the  said  Lot  4  has  been  sold  to  the"
"predecessor in title of the defendants by way of the deed marked V-02, by the"
"person who became entitled to the entire Lot 4, who is also the predecessor"
"in title as claimed by the plaintiffs."
