Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action against the three defendants in the

District Court of Pugoda, seeking a declaration of title to the land described

in the second schedule to the plaint, along with consequential reliefs, on

the following grounds:

(a) that Deed of Transfer No. 3010 marked P1, by which the plaintiff

transferred the property to the 1 defendant, was not an outright

transfer but was executed solely as security for a loan obtained by

the plaintiff from the 1 defendant, and therefore the 1 defendant

held the property in trust for the plaintiff;

(b) that no valid title passed to the 2 defendant under Deed of Transfer

No. 3704 marked P5, executed by the 1 defendant;

(c) that no valid title passed to the 3 defendant under Deed of Transfer

No. 6364 marked P4, executed by the 2 defendant; and

(d) that Deed No. 3704 is invalid by operation of the doctrine of laesio

enormis.

The defendants sought dismissal of the action.

After trial, the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs action with costs.

3

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

The appeal preferred against the judgment of the District Court was

dismissed by the High Court of Civil Appeal of Avissawella.

A previous Bench of this Court granted leave to appeal to the plaintiff on

the following questions of law:

(a) Is the judgment of the High Court inconsistent with the provisions of

section 774 of the Civil Procedure Code as it merely summarised,

paraphrased and made precis of the judgment of the District Court?

(b) Did the High Court fail to hold that the failure and/or neglect on the

part of the District Judge to answer issues No.18 to 27 resulted in the

Judgment of the District Court rendering null and void ab initio?

(c) Did the High Court fail to consider that upon the District Judge

answering issues No.4 and 5 in favour of the plantiff, and the trust

being established, the purported transfers to the 2nd Defendant and

thereafter to the 3rd Defendant were subject to trust?

(d) Did the High Court fail to consider that in view of the Roman Dutch

Law maxim nemo potest plus juris ad alium transferee quam ipse

habet the transferee does not receive any better title than the

transferor and in this case the 2nd Defendant had title subject to the

trust and beneficial interest of the plaintiff?

It must be emphasised that leave to appeal has been granted solely on

questions of law, and not on any disputed questions of fact.

Nonetheless, I shall briefly consider the facts of this case to understand the

real dispute between the parties. In paragraphs 4, 5, and 10 of the answer,

the 1 defendant expressly admitted that Deed No. 3010, by which the

plaintiff transferred the land to the 1 defendant, was in fact executed as

security for a loan of Rs. 15,000 obtained by the plaintiff from him; that the

said loan, together with interest, was repaid by the plaintiff to the 1

defendant; and that upon such repayment, the 1 defendant retransferred

4

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

the property to the plaintiff on 03.02.2000; and that he did not transfer the

property to the 2 defendant.

The above facts have been expressly admitted by the plaintiff in his police

complaint dated 22.12.2003, marked by the plaintiff himself as P3. The

same document was also marked as 1V1 by the 1 defendant during the

cross-examination of the plaintiff. In this complaint, which was made prior

to the institution of the instant action, the plaintiff further stated that,

following the retransfer of the land to him by the 1 defendant, he

transferred the land to the 2 defendant by a deed of transfer, and that he

also paid the notarial fees to the notary. It is significant to note that, in the

police complaint, the plaintiffs allegation is directed against the notary, and

not against the 1 defendant. The plaintiffs position in this complaint

appears to be that he did not intend to transfer the beneficial interest in the

land to the 2 defendant. The plaintiffs grievance to the police was that the

2 defendant refused to retransfer the land to him upon his offer to repay

the money obtained from the 2 defendant.

During the course of re-examination, counsel for the plaintiff sought

clarification regarding the aforesaid police complaint. The plaintiffs

explanation was that what he had stated to the police was correct, and that

the complaint had been made against the notary. The plaintiff did not assert

that the contents of P3 are false. He further stated that the complaint was

subsequently withdrawn at the request of the notary, who had assured him

that he would resolve the matter.

According to Deed No. 3704 marked P5, by which the property was

transferred to the 2 defendant, the named transferor is the 1 defendant,

and the plaintiff is cited as an attesting witness. All relevant deeds,

including P5, have been executed by the plaintiffs notary. The 1 defendant

states that he merely signed the documents presented to him and that he

lays no claim to the land.

5

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

The 2 defendant obtained possession of the land at the time of the

execution of his deed marked P5. Although the plaintiff alleges in the plaint

that possession was obtained by force, there is no supporting material such

as a police complaint to substantiate that claim. The plaintiff has handed

over all his original title deeds. These deeds were subsequently produced at

the trial by the 3 defendant, to whom the land was later transferred by the

2nd defendant. These circumstances are wholly inconsistent with the

plaintiffs claim in the police complaint that the beneficial interest in the

property remained with him after the transfer to the 2nd defendant.

The issues raised by the plaintiff at the trial were centered on the contention

that Deed No. 3010 marked P1, by which the land was transferred to the 1

defendant, was executed merely as security for a loan obtained by the

plaintiff from the 1 defendant, and not as an outright transfer of title. On

that basis, the plaintiff further contended that no valid title passed to the

2 defendant under Deed No. 3704 marked P5, and that the 2 defendant

was therefore not in a position to transfer the land to the 3 defendant by

Deed No. 6364 marked P4.

There was no necessity for the plaintiff to frame issues on the basis that

Deed No. 3010 marked P1 was executed merely as security for a loan

obtained by the plaintiff from the 1 defendant when that fact was expressly

admitted by the 1st defendant in his answer.

The plaintiff failed to frame the real issue in dispute, namely, how the 2

defendant came to be the owner of the property. Instead, the plaintiff simply

contended that the 2 defendant could not have acquired title under Deed

No. 3704 marked P5, on the basis that the named transferor was the 1

defendant. The plaintiff thus failed to address and effectively concealed the

real dispute reflected in his own police complaint marked P3.

6

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

It is evident from the issues raised that the plaintiffs position prior to the

institution of the action and after the institution of the action are materially

different. In particular, the version disclosed in the police complaint marked

P3 is at variance with the case pleaded and pursued at trial. In my view, the

plaintiff is not entitled to maintain the action as presently constituted.

The learned District Judge analysed the evidence led at the trial and

concluded that the plaintiff had failed to establish his case on a balance of

probabilities. On appeal, the High Court affirmed the judgment of the

District Court.

The plaintiffs argument before this Court is that the judgment of the High

Court should be set aside on the ground that it fails to comply with the

requirements of section 774(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, in that the High

Court merely reiterated the findings of the District Court without assigning

independent reasons for its conclusion.

In a court of law, a judgment is the final determination made by a court in

a legal proceeding. It is the formal expression of the courts decision on the

issues of fact and law that have been raised for adjudication, and it

embodies the judicial reasoning that underpins that decision. In terms of

section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code, judgment means the statement

given by the Judge of the grounds of a decree or order. Thus, a judgment

must articulate not only the decision itself, but also the rationale for arriving

at that decision.

Section 774(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

The judgment which shall be given or taken down in writing, shall be

signed and dated by the Judges, and shall state-

(a) the points for determination;

(b) the decision of the Judges thereon;

7

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

(c) the reasons which have led to the decision;

(d) the relief, if any, to which the appellant is entitled on the appeal in

consequence of the decision.

According to Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code, the same requisites

are prescribed in a judgment of the District Court as well.

187. The judgment shall contain a concise statement of the case, the

points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such

decision; and the opinions of the assessors (if any) shall be prefixed to

the judgment and signed by such assessors respectively.

In order to constitute a valid judgment, it is not sufficient merely to repeat

the cases advanced by the contending parties and state the final decision.

The court must clearly identify the actual points for determination, record

its findings on each such point, and, most importantly, set out the reasons

that underpin those findings. A judgment that fails to disclose the reasons

for the decision is no judgment in the eyes of the law.

However, where the District Judge has given adequate reasons for the

findings reached, and the appellate court concurs with those findings, it

cannot be said that the appellate court has failed to comply with section

774(2) merely because it adopted the reasoning of the trial judge with

approval. The appellate court is not required to rehear the case or re-

evaluate the evidence afresh as if it were a trial court. Where the reasoning

of the District Court is found to be sound and is adopted by the appellate

court, it constitutes the reasons for the appellate courts decision.

As a general principle, in direct appeals, the appellate court is required to

address the grounds of appeal or the points in contest raised in the petition

of appeal, or in the written submissions filed prior to the argument and

further elaborated during the argument. In appeals where leave of court has

8

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

been obtained, the appellate court is confined to determining the questions

of law on which such leave was granted.

Although those requisites must be present in the judgment, it is not

necessary for a judgment to set out the points for determination, the

decision thereon, and the reasons for the decision in that precise sequence

or under distinct subheadings. What is required is that these three essential

elements are discernible when the judgment is read as a whole. That

constitutes sufficient compliance with the statutory requirements.

The structure and style of a judgment may vary, depending inter alia on the

personal preferences of the judge and the nature and complexity of the case.

Indeed, the same judge may adopt different formats in different cases, as

circumstances may warrant. The essence of judicial duty lies in delivering

reasoned justice. The form or style adopted by the judge is secondary and

should not detract from that fundamental objective.

The principal submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellant

before this Court is that the judgment of the District Court ought to be set

aside on the ground that the learned District Judge failed to answer the 1

defendants issues No. 18 to 23 and the additional issues raised by the

plaintiff No. 24 to 27.

These issues were raised on a date subsequent to the framing of issues by

the plaintiff and the 2 and 3 defendants. As previously explained, the real

contest lies between the plaintiff and the 2 defendant, inasmuch as the 1

defendant, in his answer, categorically admitted that Deed P1 was not an

outright transfer but was executed merely as security for a loan, and further

stated that he was unaware of the contents of Deed P5.

In view of the admitted facts contained in the plaintiffs police complaint

marked P3, the 1 defendant ought not to have raised any issue except issue

No. 23, which asserts that the plaintiff instituted the action against the 1

9

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

defendant without any basis. The additional issues raised by the plaintiff

were in response to the 1 defendants claim that he was entitled to

compensation on the ground that he had been wrongly named as a

defendant in the action. The learned District Judge, however, did not grant

compensation to the 1 defendant in the judgment.

Accordingly, it is abundantly clear that no prejudice was caused to the

plaintiff by the District Judges failure to answer the said issues, which

appears to have occurred by oversight.

Where the points in contest or the issues have been considered and

addressed with reasons in the body of the judgment, the failure to answer

certain issues, or the answering of some issues in a manner inconsistent

with such findings, does not, per se, vitiate the judgment. In the course of

writing a judgment, momentary lapses on the part of a Judge may occur,

for Judges, though tasked with a solemn duty, are nonetheless human

beings. Unless such lapses go to the root of the judgment and materially

affect its outcome, they should be reconciled as far as reasonably possible.

A judgment must be read and understood in its entirety, as a cohesive

whole, and not merely by considering the issues framed and the answers

given thereto.

As Justice Edussuriya aptly observed in the Supreme Court case of

Udugamkorale v. Mary Nona [2003] 2 Sri LR 7 at 9 the answers to issues in

a judgment are almost always monosyllabic and are a follow up on the

matters in issues discussed, dealt with and decided in the body of the

judgment. Hence the decision of the case must be arrived at by a careful

reading of the body of the judgment and not on a superficial reading of the

answers to the issues.

In dealing with the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, the proviso to Article

138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment, decree or order of any

10

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned

a failure of justice. This constitutional safeguard ensures that appellate

intervention is not grounded on mere technicalities, but only on errors that

have materially affected the outcome of the case.

Accordingly, unless the error, defect, or irregularity complained of either (a)

has prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties, or (b) has occasioned a

failure of justice, no judgment or order shall be varied or set aside by the

appellate court. This provision reflects a principle of judicial restraint,

requiring appellate courts to respect the finality of trial court decisions

where the proceedings, viewed as a whole, have been fair and just. It also

underscores the duty of the appellate court to distinguish between harmless

procedural lapses and those that go to the root of the matter, causing actual

injustice to a party.

The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and all other laws must be

interpreted in a manner consistent with its provisions. This fundamental

principle is recognised and upheld by statutory laws as well, which often

restate it by way of emphasis. It is imperative that Judges in appellate

courts bear this fundamental principle firmly in mind when discharging

their appellate function.

Section 334(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, as

amended, reads as follows:

The Court of Appeal on any appeal against conviction on a verdict of a

jury shall allow the appeal if it thinks that such verdict should be set

aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported

having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court before

which the appellant was convicted should be set aside on the ground

of a wrong decision of any question of any law or that on any ground

11

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss

the appeal:

Provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that

the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the

appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial

miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:

Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment passed

by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or altered on

appeal or revision on account

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint, summons,

warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other proceedings

before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceedings under

this Code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a

failure of justice.

Section 456A of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:

The failure to comply with any provision of this Code shall not affect or

be deemed to have affected the validity of any complaint, committal or

indictment or the admissibility of any evidence unless such failure has

occasioned a substantial miscarriage of justice.

Section 11(1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No.

19 of 1990 reads as follows:

12

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise, subject to the provisions

of this Act or any other law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction

of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by any High

Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of

its jurisdiction under paragraph (3) (a), or (4) of Article 154P of the

Constitution and sole and exclusive cognizance by way of appeal,

revision and restitutio in integrum of all causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things of which such High Court may have

taken cognizance:

Provided that, no judgment, decree or order of any such High Court,

shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect, or

irregularity which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the

parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

Section 5A of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No.

19 of 1990 (as amended by Act No. 54 of 2006) reads as follows:

5A(1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for

a Province, shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and

made by any District Court or a Family Court within such Province and

the appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law,

which shall be committed by any such District Court or Family Court,

as the case may be.

(2) The provisions of sections 23 to 27 of the Judicature Act, No. 2 of

1978 and sections 753 to 760 and sections 765 to 777 of the Civil

Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any written law applicable to the

exercise of the jurisdiction referred to in subsection (1) by the Court of

Appeal, shall be read and construed as including a reference to a High

Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a Province and

13

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

any person aggrieved by any judgment, decree or order of a District

Court or a Family Court, as the case may be, within a Province, may

invoke the jurisdiction referred to in that subsection, in the High Court

established for that Province:

Provided that no judgment or decree of a District Court or of a Family

Court, as the case may be, shall be reversed or varied by the High

Court on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure

of justice.

In Vernon Boteju v. Public Trustee [2001] 2 Sri LR 124 at 128-129, Justice

Weerasekera stated:

Proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution provides that no judgment,

decree or order of any Court shall be reversed or varied on an error,

defect or irregularity which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of

the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. The learned District Judge

has arrived at findings on the points for determination upon an

evaluation of the evidence led in this case. Therefore, despite the error

that has occurred in answering issue No. 13 and his failure to answer

some issues it is not open to the defendant-appellant to assert that

prejudice has been caused to his substantial rights or has occasioned

a failure of justice.

In Gunaratna v. Nandawathie [2003] 3 Sri LR 96, the District Judge had

failed to answer a material issue raised by the appellant concerning the

applicability of section 111 of the Trusts Ordinance read with section 10 of

the Prescription Ordinance. This formed one of the principal contentions

before the appellate court. However, Justice Dissanayake declined to allow

the appeal on that basis, stating at page 100 as follows:

14

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

Even if issue No.9(c) is answered, the defendant-appellant could never

succeed in this action as his plea of prescription would fail. Hence even

if provisions of section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code have not been

complied with by the learned District Judge, by his failure to answer

issue 9(c) no prejudice would be caused to the defendant-appellant.

In Gunasena v. Kandage [1997] 3 Sri LR 393, despite the District Judges

failure to properly analyse the evidence and to answer certain issues,

Justice Weerasuriya, referring to the proviso to Article 138(1) of the

Constitution, affirmed the judgment of the District Court, stating at pages

400401 that:

It is clear on a close examination of the totality of the evidence that the

learned District Judge is correct in entering judgment for the plaintiffs-

respondents as prayed for in the plaint. However, she was in error for

failing to adduce reasons for her findings. Nevertheless, the question

that has to be examined is whether or not such failure on her part had

prejudiced the substantial rights of defendant-appellant or has

occasioned a failure of justice. Having considered the totality of the

evidence, it seems to me that no prejudice has been caused to the

substantial rights of the defendant-appellant or has occasioned a

failure of justice by this error, defect or irregularity of the judgment.

Similar conclusion was reached by Justice Weerasuriya in Victor v. Cyril De

Silva [1998] 1 Sri LR 41 at 46:

It is apparent that the learned District Judge has not engaged in an

exhaustive analysis of the evidence led at the trial. Nevertheless, on

the basis of overwhelming evidence led on behalf of the plaintiff-

respondent and the evidence of Piyasena Silva, who was called by the

defendants-appellants, the conclusion is irresistible that a judgment for

the plaintiff-respondent, as prayed for in the plaint is inevitable.

15

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

Article 138 (1) of the Constitution which deals with the jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal is on the following terms:

138(1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction

for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed

by any court of first instance

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity which

has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice.

It is evident on a close examination of the totality of the evidence that

the District Judge is correct in pronouncing a judgment in favour of the

plaintiff-respondent as prayed for in the plaint. However, the learned

District Judge was in obvious error when she failed to evaluate the

evidence in terms of section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code. The failure

of the learned District Judge to comply with the imperative provisions

of section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code has not substantially

prejudiced the rights of the defendants-appellants, or has not

occasioned a failure of justice to the defendants-appellants.

In the circumstances, we affirm the judgment and the decree of the

learned District Judge and dismiss this appeal with costs.

It has been clearly established by this Court in several decisions, including

Sunil Jayaratne v. Attorney-General [2011]2SriLR91 at 101, Kiri

Mahaththaya and Another v. Attorney-General [2020]1SriLR10 at 1819,

and The State v. Chandana Sri Lal Gurusinghe and Others

(SC/APPEAL/139/2019, SC Minutes of 05.04.2024 at pages 612), that in

order for a judgment of the trial court to be vitiated, the appellant must

satisfy the court that the alleged lapse or non-compliance has resulted in

16

SC/APPEAL/231/2017

prejudice to the substantial rights of the appellant or has occasioned a

failure of justice, as stipulated in the proviso to Article 138(1) of the

Constitution.

However, what has been stated herein should not be construed as a licence

to disregard the mandatory requirements set out in section 187 and section

774(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. The applicability of the proviso to Article

138(1) of the Constitution must be determined by the appellate court,

having regard to the particular facts and circumstances of each case.

In the present case, while it appears that the learned District Judge

inadvertently failed to answer certain issues, it is evident that such

omission has not prejudiced the plaintiffs substantial rights nor has it

resulted in a failure of justice. The body of the judgment clearly reflects a

full evaluation of the relevant evidence on the points of contest, and the

findings are well supported. Accordingly, there is no justifiable basis to set

aside the judgment of the District Court on account of this omission.

I answer the questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted in the

negative and dismiss the appeal with costs.
