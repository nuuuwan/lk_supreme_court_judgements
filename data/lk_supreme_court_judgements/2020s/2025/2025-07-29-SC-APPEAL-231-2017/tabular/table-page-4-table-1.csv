"the property to the plaintiff on 03.02.2000; and that he did not transfer the"
"property to the 2ⁿᵈ defendant."
"The above facts have been expressly admitted by the plaintiff in his police"
"complaint  dated  22.12.2003,  marked  by  the  plaintiff  himself  as  P3.  The"
"same document was also marked as 1V1 by the 1ˢᵗ  defendant during the"
"cross-examination of the plaintiff. In this complaint, which was made prior"
"to  the  institution  of  the  instant  action,  the  plaintiff  further  stated  that,"
"following  the  retransfer  of  the 
land  to  him  by  the  1ˢᵗ  defendant,  he"
"transferred the land to the 2ⁿᵈ defendant by a deed of transfer, and that he"
"also paid the notarial fees to the notary. It is significant to note that, in the"
"police complaint, the plaintiff’s allegation is directed against the notary, and"
"not  against  the  1ˢᵗ  defendant.  The  plaintiff’s  position  in  this  complaint"
"appears to be that he did not intend to transfer the beneficial interest in the"
"land to the 2ⁿᵈ defendant. The plaintiff’s grievance to the police was that the"
"2ⁿᵈ defendant refused to retransfer the land to him upon his offer to repay"
"the money obtained from the 2ⁿᵈ defendant."
"During  the  course  of  re-examination,  counsel 
for  the  plaintiff  sought"
"clarification 
regarding 
the  aforesaid  police  complaint.  The  plaintiff’s"
"explanation was that what he had stated to the police was correct, and that"
"the complaint had been made against the notary. The plaintiff did not assert"
"that the contents of P3 are false. He further stated that the complaint was"
"subsequently withdrawn at the request of the notary, who had assured him"
"that he would resolve the matter."
"According  to  Deed  No.  3704  marked  P5,  by  which  the  property  was"
"transferred to the 2ⁿᵈ defendant, the named transferor is the 1ˢᵗ defendant,"
"and  the  plaintiff 
is  cited  as  an  attesting  witness.  All  relevant  deeds,"
"including P5, have been executed by the plaintiff’s notary. The 1ˢᵗ defendant"
"states that he merely signed the documents presented to him and that he"
"lays no claim to the land."
