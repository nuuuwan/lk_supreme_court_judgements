The Plain however claims that their father was also known by the name, Waa Kankanamlage Podi Appuhamy. Whether Waewa Kankanamlage Podi Appuhamy and Waa Kankanamlage Podi Appuhamy are one and the same person is one of the principal issues in this case, for the aforemenoned reason that while the Selement Order P1 published in 1996 carries the name Waa Kankanamlage Podi Appuhamy, all other documents including the death cercate of Podi Appuhamy refers to him as Waewa Kankanamlage Podi Appuhamy. According to the Plain, pursuant to the death of Podi Appuhamy in 1967, share of the land had devolved on his wife, and the other share on his six children. The Plain states that with the death of Baby Hamy, her share had devolved in equal proporon among the six children and with the death of Karunawathie, her share had devolved on the remaining ve children, thus leaving each surviving child of Podi Appuhamy and Baby Hamy with 1/5th share of the said land. The Plain states further that Missy Nona and Siriyawathie sold their 1/5th share in the land to the Plain and that the Plain holds 3/5th share of the land, with the 1st Defendant holding 1/5th share and the other 1/5th share being held by the 2nd 7th Defendants pursuant to the demise of Seen. Paron acon On 23rd December 2002, the Plain led acon in the District Court of Embilipiya [the District Court] against the 1st 7th Defendants on the basis that tle that Podi Appuhamy had derived in terms of P1 had devolved on his heirs and seeking to paron the said land among the Plain, the 1st Defendant and the 2nd 7th Defendants on the basis of the aforemenoned share rao. An amended plaint was led on 30th July 2004. The 2nd 7th Defendants did not le a statement of claim and the trial proceeded against them ex parte. In his statement of claim, the 1st Defendant, having admied the situaon of the land, stated that he has been in exclusive possession of the land since 1969, a claim which has been rejected by the Plain, and that he has culvated the land since then. The 1st Defendant raised two principal defences in his statement of claim. The rst is that the said land had been seled in favour of Waa Kankanamlage Podi Appuhamy and not in favour",

The second was that in any event, the Selement Order has been published in the Gazee pursuant to the death of Podi Appuhamy and hence, Podi Appuhamy does not acquire any rights over the said land and aforori neither the Plain nor the 2nd 7th Defendants. Judgment of the District Court and the High Court Trial commenced in the District Court on 21st May 2005. The Plain gave evidence and led the evidence of four other witnesses. The 1st Defendant too gave evidence. By its judgment delivered on 25th August 2008, the District Court held with the Plain and allowed the said land to be paroned on the basis of 3/5th share to the Plain, 1/5th share to the 1st Defendant and the balance 1/5th share to the 2nd 7th Defendant. With regard to the discrepancy in the name of Podi Appuhamy, the District Court acted upon the evidence of the Plain, the 1st Defendant, their sister, Missy Nona and the other witnesses in arriving at the conclusion that Waa Kankanamlage Podi Appuhamy and Waewa Kankanamlage Podi Appuhamy are one and the same person and therefore P1 has been seled in favour of the father of the Plain and the 1st Defendant. On the queson of the validity of P1, the District Court took into consideraon the evidence of the witness from the Land Selement Department that the Selement Order P1 has been made in favour of the person with whom an agreement has been entered into in terms of Secon 5(4)(c) of the Ordinance and that the death of the person in whose favour the selement has been made does not aect the validity of the Selement Order. Aggrieved by the judgment of the District Court, the 1st Defendant invoked the appellate jurisdicon of the Civil Appellate High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratnapura [the High Court]. The appeal was dismissed by judgment delivered on 7th December 2010, with the High Court taking the view that the death of Podi Appuhamy did not aect the validity of P1 for the reason that the Ordinance did not contain any specic provision in this regard. The High Court relied on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Fernando v De Silva and others [(2000) 3 Sri LR 29] in arriving at its conclusion that, there is no provision in the Ordinance which enacts that a selement order to be",

    "text": "I shall rst consider the background relang to land selement and the scheme set out in the Ordinance and thereaer consider the above two quesons. Land Selement background In order to give context to the rst queson, it is important to understand the origins of the concept of land selement. With Ceylon, as we were known at that me, becoming a colony of the Brish, the system that prevailed with regard to land ownership was replaced with the Prevenon of Encroachments upon Crown Lands Ordinance, No. 12 of 1840. In terms of this Ordinance, all lands were declared as Crown land unl any claim of ownership to a parcular land was established by way of deeds, grants and/or such other documentary evidence. Through this process of land selement arose the presumpon that all lands within the Country belonged to the Crown unless the contrary was established. The above Ordinance, as expected, resulted in many Ceylonese having to forgo ownership to their lands. Owing to the dissasfacon that ensued, the Government of that me had introduced the Waste Lands Ordinance, No. 1 of 1897, in terms of which, all unculvated lands were declared as Crown land. The harsh manner in which the new law was implemented and the injusce caused to the People by the said law has been well documented and was even the subject maer of debate in the House of Lords where Lord Stanley of Alderly had implored upon the necessity of an independent inquiry into the working of the Ceylon Waste Lands Ordinance, and to the injusce caused . [Debates of 17th July 1899 - hps://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1899/jul/17/ceylon-waste-lands-ordinance] The indiscriminate manner in which the presumpon that all unculvated lands are State lands was applied in pracce was referred to by Chief Jusce Bertram in Hamina Etena v The Assistant Government Agent, Pualam [23 NLR 289; at page 290], when he stated that, According to that presumpon, all forests, waste, unoccupied, or unculvated lands, and all chenas are presumed to be the property of the Crown unless the contrary thereof is proved. It is hardly contested that, if the presumpon applies, the evidence adduced on behalf of the complainant is not sucient to displace it.",

The scheme laid down in the Ordinance comprised of three stages, they being (1) the publicaon of a Selement Noce specifying the lands that the State wished to sele, (2) the acceptance of claims in respect of the lands referred to in such Selement Noce, and an inquiry into such claims, and nally (3) the making of a Selement Order followed by its publicaon in the Gazee. I shall now consider these three stages in detail. In terms of Secon 4(1), whenever it appears to the Selement Ocer that any land (a) is forest, waste, unoccupied, or unculvated land, or (b) is culvated or otherwise improved land but was forest, waste, unoccupied, or unculvated land in the preceding twenty ve years, he may publish a Selement Noce containing details of such lands and specifying that, if no claim to such land or to any share of or interest in such land is made to him within a period of three months from a date to be specied in such noce the land to which or to any share of or interest in which no claim has been made as aforesaid will be declared under Secon 5 (1) to be the property of the State and will be dealt with on account of the State. In terms of Secon 5(1), If no claim is made within a period of three months , the Selement Ocer shall make a declaraon in wring, which shall be deemed for the purposes of this Ordinance to be a selement in favour of the State, that such land to which or to any share of or interest in which no claim has been made is the property of the State. If however a claim is made within such period, Secon 5(2) requires the Selement Ocer to proceed to hold an inquiry into such claim. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Selement Ocer may do one of the following specied in Secon 5(4): (a) Make a declaraon in wring [which shall be deemed to be a selement] that any",

The fact that the father of the Plain was also known as Waa Kankanamlage is not supported by any documentary evidence. Thus, on the face of it, P1 and P7 may not be a reference to the father of the Plain and the 1st Defendant. However, the Plain stated that his parents were in occupaon of the land that is the subject maer of this case, his father took part at an inquiry held by the Land Commissioner, and that the said land was seled in favour of his father. This evidence went unchallenged. Missy Nona, the sister of the Plain too stated that the impugned land had been owned by her father. The Grama Niladhari of the area stated that he made inquiries and found that there was no such person by the name of Waa Kankanamlage. The Ocer from the Land Selement Department stated that except for the discrepancy in the rst name, the balance part of the name and the address of the beneciary was one and the same. He stated further that when it came to handing over a copy of P1, he had made inquiries regarding the heirs of Podi Appuhamy and that P1 was handed over to the 1st Defendant on the basis that he is the son of the person on whom the land had been seled. The most important evidence was perhaps that of the 1st Defendant. Having stated that, (a) he, together with his parents and siblings were resident on the said land, (b) he commenced culvang the land at the request of his father, and (c) aer the death of his father, he culvated the land on his own, the 1st Defendant stated as follows:",

The District Court has very carefully analysed the above evidence and acted thereon in arriving at the conclusion that, (a) even though there is a discrepancy in the name, Waa Kankanamlage and Waewa Kankanamlage are one and the same person, and (b) the land referred to in P7 and P1 has been seled in favour of the father of the Plain and the 1st Defendant. The High Court has not considered this issue, probably for the reason that the reference in P1 to Waa Kankanamlage was an obvious error. I am of the view that the conclusion reached by the District Court is not only logical but correct, and I am therefore in agreement with the nding of the District Court. The legal validity of the Selement Order The second queson in this case is with regard to the validity of P1. The argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Defendant with regard to the validity of the Selement Order was twofold. The rst was that tle would devolve upon a person only once the Selement Order is published in the Gazee. The second is that since Podi Appuhamy had passed away by the me the Selement Order was published, the said Order made in favour of Podi Appuhamy is a nullity, and therefore no tle passes to Podi Appuhamy and the tle in the land reverts back to the State. It was therefore argued that since P1 does not confer any tle on Podi Appuhamy, the Plain cannot rely on P1 to derive tle to the land referred to in P1 and hence, there is no legal basis for the Plain to have led the paron acon since he is neither an owner nor a co-owner of the said land.",

It only does so, however, so far as the Crown or any person is thereby declared to be entled to any land or to any share of or interest in any land that is to say, declared by the terms of the Selement Order. The word thereby must mean that. [Page 85] a Selement Order drawn up according to Form 2 is meant to be and can be implied to be a declaraon. I have no doubt, as I think a study of the wording used in secon 5 of the Ordinance will show. This secon, inter alia, provides that a Selement Ocer may enter into an agreement with a claimant whereby a claimant or any other person shall be declared by Selement Order under sub-secon (5) of the secon to be entled either wholly or in part to any land specied in the Selement Noce [subsecon (4)(c)] and sub-secon (5) says that the Selement Ocer shall embody any such selement in a Selement Order which shall be substanally as set out in Form No. 2 in the First Schedule. That seems to me to make it reasonably certain that the Legislature meant Form No. 2 to be declaratory for proceedings iniated under the Land Selement Ordinance [Page 86] Under secon 8 it is the Selement Order so published, that is in the Ceylon Government Gazee, that shall be judicially noted as conclusive proof of tle.

The essence of the agreement is the undertaking by the Crown to sele land subsequently on the claimant by the procedure provided for by sub-secon (5 ). [page 86-87; emphasis added] Thus, the entlement of a claimant to a parcular land which is recognised through an agreement is formalised by the publicaon of a Selement Order, vesng such land absolutely in such claimant, with such Order receiving the legal sancty referred to in Secon 8. In Periacaruppen Chear v Messrs Proprietors and Agents Ltd and others [(1946) 47 NLR 121; at page 125] Chief Jusce Howard, having considered the precise eect of an order under Secon 8 of the Land Selement Ordinance stated that, In my opinion the order of October 27, 1933, is conclusive proof of the tle of Gunasekera. The order vests the tle in Gunasekera subject to any encumbrances specied in the order. All unspecied interests are excluded. The selement order, therefore, wiped out and destroyed all previous tles to the property and vested it in Gunasekera. [emphasis added] Thus, Chief Jusce Howard proceeded on the basis that a deed executed prior to the Selement Order cannot be classied as an encumbrance since no reference has been made in the Selement Order to the said deed and therefore accepted the posion laid down in Secon 8 that the eect of the publicaon of a Selement Order is that it shall be conclusive proof that the person referred to in a Selement Order is entled to such land free of all encumbrances whatsoever other than those specied in such order. While Secon 8 is clear with regard to the eect of a Selement Order, what a Selement Order does is twofold. The rst is, there is recognion by the State that the private party who claimed the land pursuant to the publicaon of a Selement Noce has an entlement in respect of such land and for that reason, declares that the State has no claim over such land. The second is a Selement Order confers conclusive proof that such person is entled to such land free of all encumbrances whatsoever other than those specied in such order, and that the said land shall vest absolutely in such person.",

Thus, the interest of Podi Appuhami to the said land has been recognised as far back as 1954, and the Selement Order published in 1996 is a formal recognion of the entlement of Podi Appuhamy to such land to the exclusion of all others including the State. The Selement Order P1 was published 43 years aer the publicaon of the Selement Noce specifying the names of the persons on whom lands referred to in Village Plan No. 888 have been seled. The claim of Podi Appuhamy has been duly recognised in 1954, the land has been seled in his favour in 1993, and there is formal recognion by the publicaon of P1 in 1996 that tle has vested absolutely in Podi Appuhamy. As expected, most of the persons on whom lands have been seled since the publicaon of the Selement Noce in 1953, including Podi Appuhamy had passed away by the me P1 was published. Keeping in mind the objecve that is sought to be achieved by the system of land selement that I have referred to, I am of the view that Podi Appuhamy, and since he had passed away by the me of the publicaon of the Selement Order, his heirs, are entled to the land referred to in P1. The death of Podi Appuhamy does not viate his tle to the said land nor does the land revert to the State but the land shall devolve on his heirs and they shall be entled to claim such land. To say that the right of the heirs of Podi Appuhamy to claim the benet of such selement has been exnguished by the passing away of Podi Appuhamy does not stand to reason. Accordingly, the Plain, being a son of Podi Appuhamy is entled to a share of such land upon the death of Podi Appuhamy. The High Court stated that:",
