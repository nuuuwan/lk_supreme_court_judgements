Nothing has been placed before this court that the Petitioner and /or the Commissioner took steps under those provisions with regard to the present dispute. This creates a doubt as to the fact whether the enforcement of the order in case No.42705 was correctly done limiting the execution to the correct corpus. It must be noted that, as appears from the brief, the position of some of the Respondent- Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter Respondents) is that in executing the direction of the magistrate court order in case No.42705, the Petitioner had shown the paddy lands they had in their possession perhaps in excess of the 6-acre land for which the said order relates. It must be observed that there is no provision similar to Sections 325 or 328 of the Civil Procedure Code in the Agrarian Development Act providing relief for a person who was wrongfully dispossessed in executing the magistrates direction. It is also observed that there is no material to indicate that any one belong to the 2nd Party Respondents in case No. 43361 were claiming their rights through the evicted person, the tenant cultivator. The 1st Party Respondent in the said case No.43361 was the Petitioner in the matter at hand. If the execution of the direction of the Magistrate in case No. 42705 gave rise to a new dispute as to the possession creating situation that may cause breach of peace, the police have sufficient ground to file an action in terms of section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. Furthermore, the Primary Court is empowered to make a suitable order in terms of the Primary Courts Procedure Act to maintain peace until the parties get that new dispute resolved through the proper forum or Court with the jurisdiction to solve",

On the other hand, the Petitioner herself, as the 1st Party Respondent in the said case No.43361, in her affidavit dated 06.07.2001 in paragraph 6 has admitted that a land dispute that may cause breach of peace had arisen in terms of section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act and further she had prayed for relief accordingly- vide pages 109 to112 of the brief. Now she cannot be allowed to say that placing her in possession cannot give rise to an application in terms of section 66 of the Primary Courts Act and/or no breach of peace can occur due to an enforcement order made by the Magistrate Court in her own revision application. It may be noted that a breach of peace may occur if the enforcement affected the rights of other parties who do not claim under the person evicted through that eviction order, especially when the enforcement was done according to the boundary shown by the Petitioner herself without getting the boundaries and the extent verified through a survey plan.",

Thus, the Primary Court Judge ordered not to disturb the possession of the 2nd Party Respondents. It must be noted that there is nothing to say that 2nd Party Respondents were claiming through the person who was evicted through the order of the Magistrate Court.

    "text": "An order made by the Primary Court Judge is a provisional remedy to maintain peace until the parties seek proper remedy from the competent forum or Court and get it executed. If the 1st party Respondent in case No.43361 (the Petitioner) has no doubt that he was placed in the 6-acre land referred to in the order made by the Magistrate in accordance with the application made by the Commissioner, she could have easily taken steps, if necessary, through the commissioner, in terms of the section 8(5) and (6) of the Agrarian development Act. If the dispute relates to any other dispute relating to the possession or any other right, she could have sought remedies from the competent court or forum in that regard. Instead, being aggrieved by the decision of the Primary Court Judge, the Petitioner invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court by filing a Revision application. Even though the Primary Court Judges order was not to disturb the possession of the 2nd Party Respondents, in her petition in Revision application, the Petitioner did not include all the parties named as 2nd Party Respondents before the Primary Court. She in her petition in the revision application has stated that the parties who failed to file affidavit in the application under section 66 are considered as defaulters, they need not be noticed with regard to the Revision application indicating that they need not be made parties. However, unlike a direct appeal, a revision application originates in the Court which has revisionary powers. It is not a continuation of the action that was concluded in the Court below but a new application. Thus, if the revision application affects the rights of any person whose rights have been confirmed by the Court below, it is the duty of the Petitioner to the revision application to make that person a party to the revision application. As said before, the order of the Primary Court was not to disturb the possession of the 2nd Party Respondents. Thus, any revision application to vary or set aside such order will affect the rights of all the parties who were named as the 2nd Party Respondents before the Primary Court. It further appears that the Petitioner failed to reveal in her petition in the revision application that there is a Partition action pending for the lager land of 11 acres and that there is an interim order in that case against her not to disturb the possession of some of the parties named as the 2nd Party Respondents.",

    "text": "The second factor that has not been focused in the questions of law mentioned above is the non-disclosure of the material facts by the Petitioner in her petition to the High Court, especially the fact that there is a partition action pending for the larger land where a restraining order was made against the Petitioner not to enter into portion of the paddy land enjoyed by some of the Respondents. This is material because the cause for the breach of peace appeared to have been arisen due to the fact that the Petitioner allegedly have taken into her possession by misleadingly showing the boundaries of a land exceeding the entitlement as stated in the Magistrate Court order or after the execution of that order deceptively grabbing possession of the lands possessed by the Respondents in the guise that they were handed over to him through the execution of that order. Therefore, as contended by the 2nd Party Respondents, the dispute has arisen due to the aforesaid acts of the Petitioner when there is a pending partition action with a restraining order against the Petitioner and not per se through the correct execution of the Magistrate Courts order in MC No. 42705.",

As explained above, abuse or misuse of the process of Court may create situation of forcible possession by dispossession of the person who is entitled to possess, without authority of law.

On the other hand, even if the correct land was handed over, whether the Petitioner using the situation came to possess the paddy lands possessed by the 2nd Party Respondents in case No.43361. The boundaries of the land and extent that is contained in the order and the fiscal officers report in said case No 42705( vide pages 129 to 134 of the brief) and the boundaries and extent of the land contained in the fiscal report in the primary court case No 43361 where the possession was handed over to the Respondent on behalf of the 2nd Party Respondents in that case ( vide pages no.257 and 258) had been differently described making it clear that there is a dispute as to the identification of the land for which the Petitioners are entitled in terms of the order made in case no.42705 and the land disputed by the 2nd Party Respondents in the said case No.43361. On the other hand, order in the case No.42705 was against one A. J. S. Jinadasa and was to hand over possession from him to the Petitioner and the said order does not empower to hand over possession from the 2nd Party Respondents in Case No 43361 to the Petitioner. The Fiscal officers report in case No.42705 shows that the possession was handed over to the Petitioner as per her showing of the boundaries when the said Jinadasa was not there and as per the report it is not mentioned that any of the 2nd Party Respondents were present on that occasion. As said before there is nothing to show that the 2nd Party Respondents in case No.43361 were claiming under said Jinadasa who was to be evicted in terms of the order. Thus, a doubt arises as to whether the Petitioner might have abused the process to grab the possession of other portions the land which were possessed by the 2nd Party Respondents irrespective of the pending partition action and the restraining order issued in that case. Thus, there is a clear dispute relating to land which was not resolved by the Commissioner in the inquiry related to MC case No. 42705. As there is no provision similar to section 325 and 328 of the Civil Procedure Code in the Agrarian Development Act, the said disputes have to be resolved through a competent court or forum and as such, when there was a breach of peace or imminent threat of breaching the peace as indicated by the Police reports, the Primary Court had jurisdiction to exercise its powers unless there is a prohibition created by law. It must be noted again that the intention of the legislature with regard to section 66 application is to maintain peace until the dispute is resolved through the proper forum or court. The real dispute here is not the power to execute the order in MC No.42705 with regard to the 6 acres to be handed over in accordance with that order but whether the Petitioner in the guise of that order dispossessed the 2nd Party Respondents in Case No.43361 from lands in their possession when the order to be executed does not relate to them or lands in their possession. It does not appear that there was any affidavit from the fiscal officer who executed the order in MC. 42705 to say that the land in his report, namely what was handed over by him contained the land possessed by the 2nd Party Respondents. It must be noted that the land referred to in that order and the relevant fiscal report is a 6-acre land within the boundaries described in that order. As such, there may be a possibility that the Petitioner just after the handing over of possession by the fiscal officer, in the guise of said handing over, grabbed the possession of the paddy lands possessed by the said 2nd Party Respondents in case No. 43361 who were not subject to the said eviction order. Thus, the real dispute is not the execution of the order in MC 42705, but whether the Petitioner came into forcible possession of the 2nd Party Respondents paddy land by abusing the process of court or in the guise of the execution of the said order in MC 42705 within the period of two months prior to the filing of the report by police in action No.43361.",

The Petitioner highlights that according to fiscals report it was a peaceful handing over of possession. The Petitioner further argues that if the Respondents are aggrieved, they must go to the same court and seek relief and that a parallel court has no power to set aside or over rule an order made according to law. Referring to Mansoor V OIC Avissawella (1991) 2 Sri L R 75 and Velupillai v Sivanathan (1993) 1 Sri L R 123, the Petitioner contends that if there is specific remedy and /or specific tribunal created to hear and /or enforcement of an dispute, parties must resort to such Tribunal and as such the procedure laid down by Agrarian laws was the remedy for the dispute between the landlord and the tenant cultivator and accordingly one cannot use the Primary Courts Procedure Act to nullify the directive given by the Magistrate in terms of the application made by the Commissioner. In this regard the Petitioner brings the attention of Court to section 98 of the Agrarian Development Act.",

On the other hand, as stated above, the Petitioner herself in her affidavit filed in the section 66 action, without making any objection to exercising the powers under section 66 on the basis that there is no breach of peace that can be considered in terms of that section, had moved the Primary Court to intervene and grant relief while clearly stating that there was a dispute causing breach of peace that falls under the aforesaid section 66- Vide paragraph 6 and prayer of the affidavit dated 06.07.2001 filed by the Petitioner in MC No.43361. If she took up this position in the Primary Court the opposite parties could have placed more relevant facts to meet such stance which would have helped the original Courts as well as this Court. The Petitioner cannot be allowed to change her position and move for revision on that ground. On the other hand, if the execution of an order exceeds the power given by the order itself and the outcome affects the rights of third parties, to that extent it cannot be said that such deprivation of rights is within the authority of law. It is true that the fiscal officers report in MC No 42705 indicated a peaceful handing over of possession but it must be noted that neither the Commissioner nor the Magistrate Court nor the fiscal officer gave notice of eviction to the 2nd Party Respondents in case no. 43361; nor they were present at the occasion to present their objection for the eviction of them from the land on the basis of an order against another person. Thus, the dispute and the breach of peace could have arisen only when the said 2nd Party Respondents came to know that the Petitioner was in possession claiming through an execution of an order of Court. As explained earlier, there is no provision in the Agrarian Development Act which is similar to section 325 or 328 of the Civil Procedure Code for any aggrieved third party to make claims based on their rights if they",
