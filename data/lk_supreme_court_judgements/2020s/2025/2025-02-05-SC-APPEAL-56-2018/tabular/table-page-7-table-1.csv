"in possession, the Primary Court has to restore that person’s possession. As per the judgment"
"of  the  Primary  Court  Judge  it  appears  that  the  Judge  found  that  even  though  the  1st  party"
"Respondent in case No.43361 (the Petitioner) was placed in possession through an enforcement"
"of an order of a Court, the 2nd Party Respondents were dispossessed within  that two-month"
"period. Thus, the Primary Court Judge ordered not to disturb the possession of the 2nd Party"
"Respondents.  It  must  be  noted  that  there  is  nothing  to  say  that  2nd Party Respondents  were"
"claiming through the person who was evicted through the order of the Magistrate Court. The"
"handing over of the paddy land was done without a survey being done but as per the boundaries"
"shown by the Petitioner herself creating a dispute as to the identification of 6 acres relevant to"
"the order of the Magistrate to  hand over possession  in  view of the  application made by  the"
"Commissioner."
"An order made by the Primary Court Judge is a provisional remedy to maintain peace until the"
"parties seek proper remedy from the competent forum or Court and get it executed. If the 1st"
"party Respondent in case No.43361 (the Petitioner) has no doubt that he was placed in the 6-"
"acre land referred to in the order made by the Magistrate in accordance with the application"
"made  by  the  Commissioner,  she  could  have  easily  taken  steps,  if  necessary,  through  the"
"commissioner, in  terms  of the section 8(5) and (6) of the Agrarian development Act. If the"
"dispute relates to any other dispute relating to the possession or any other right, she could have"
"sought remedies from the competent court or forum in that regard. Instead, being aggrieved by"
"the decision of the Primary Court Judge, the Petitioner invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of"
"the High Court by filing a Revision application. Even though the Primary Court Judge’s order"
"was  not  to  disturb  the  possession  of  the  2nd  Party  Respondents,  in  her  petition  in  Revision"
"application, the Petitioner did not include all the parties named as 2nd Party Respondents before"
"the Primary Court. She in her petition in the revision application has stated that the parties who"
"failed to file affidavit in the application under section 66 are considered as defaulters, they need"
"not be noticed with regard to the Revision application indicating that they need not be made"
"parties. However, unlike a direct appeal, a revision application originates in the Court which"
"has revisionary powers. It is not a continuation of the action that was concluded in the Court"
"below but a new application. Thus, if the revision application affects the rights of any person"
"whose rights have been confirmed by the Court below, it is the duty of the Petitioner to the"
"revision application to make that person a party to the revision application. As said before, the"
"order  of  the  Primary  Court  was  not  to  disturb  the  possession  of  the  2nd Party  Respondents."
"Thus, any revision application to vary or set aside such order will affect the rights of all the"
"parties  who  were  named  as  the  2nd  Party  Respondents  before  the  Primary  Court.  It  further"
"appears that the Petitioner failed to reveal in her petition in the revision application that there"
"is a Partition action pending for the lager land of 11 acres and that there is an interim order in"
"that case against her not to disturb the possession of some of the parties named as the 2nd Party"
"Respondents."
