"In the matter at hand, as explained above, there is no clarity as to the paddy land handed over"
"to the Petitioner in MC No. 42705 as to whether it is the exact 6-acre land or another portion"
"belonged to a bigger land was included when handing over as per the showing of boundaries"
"by the Petitioner herself. On the other hand, even if the correct land was handed over, whether"
"the Petitioner using the situation came to possess the paddy lands possessed by the 2nd Party"
"Respondents in case No.43361. The boundaries of the land and extent  that is contained in the"
"order and the fiscal officer’s report in said case No 42705( vide pages 129 to 134 of the brief)"
"and the boundaries and extent of the land contained in the fiscal report in the primary court"
"case No 43361 where the possession was handed over to the Respondent on behalf of the 2nd"
"Party Respondents in that case ( vide pages no.257 and 258) had been differently described"
"making it clear that there is a dispute as to the identification of the land for which the Petitioners"
"are entitled in terms of the order made in case no.42705 and the land disputed by the 2nd Party"
"Respondents in the said case No.43361. On the other hand, order in the case No.42705 was"
"against one A. J. S. Jinadasa and was to hand over possession from him to the Petitioner and"
"the said order does not empower to hand over possession from the 2nd Party Respondents in"
"Case No 43361 to the Petitioner. The Fiscal officer’s report in case No.42705 shows that the"
"possession was handed over to the Petitioner as per her showing of the boundaries when the"
"said Jinadasa was not there and as per the report it is not mentioned that any of the 2nd Party"
"Respondents were present on that occasion. As said before there is nothing to show that the 2nd"
"Party Respondents in case No.43361 were claiming under said Jinadasa who was to be evicted"
"in terms of the order. Thus, a doubt arises as to whether the Petitioner might have abused the"
"process to grab the possession of other portions the land which were possessed by the 2nd Party"
"Respondents irrespective of the pending partition action and the restraining order issued in that"
"case. Thus, there is a clear dispute relating to land which was not resolved by the Commissioner"
"in the inquiry related to MC case No. 42705. As there is no provision similar to section 325"
"and 328 of the Civil Procedure Code in the Agrarian Development Act, the said disputes have"
"to be resolved through a competent court or forum and as such, when there was a breach of"
"peace or imminent threat of breaching the peace as indicated by the Police reports, the Primary"
"Court had jurisdiction to exercise its powers unless there is a prohibition created by law. It must"
"be noted again that the intention of the legislature with regard to section 66 application is to"
"maintain peace until the dispute is resolved through the proper forum or court. The real dispute"
"here is not the power to execute the order in MC No.42705 with regard to the 6 acres to be"
"handed over in accordance with that order but whether the Petitioner in the guise of that order"
"dispossessed the 2nd Party Respondents in Case No.43361 from lands in their possession when"
"the order to be executed does not relate to them or lands in their possession. It does not appear"
"that there was any affidavit from the fiscal officer who executed the order in MC. 42705 to say"
"that the land in his report, namely what was handed over by him contained the land possessed"
"by the 2nd Party Respondents. It must be noted that the land referred to in that order and the"
"relevant fiscal report is a 6-acre land within the boundaries described in that order. As such,"
"there may be a possibility that the Petitioner just after the handing over of possession by the"
"fiscal  officer,  in  the  guise  of  said  handing  over,  grabbed  the  possession  of  the  paddy  lands"
"possessed by the said 2nd Party Respondents in case No. 43361 who were not subject to the"
"said eviction order. Thus, the real dispute is not the execution of the order in MC 42705, but"
"whether the Petitioner came into forcible possession of the 2nd Party Respondents’ paddy land"
"by abusing the process of court or in the guise of the execution of the said order in MC 42705"
"within the period of two months prior to the filing of the report by police in action No.43361."
