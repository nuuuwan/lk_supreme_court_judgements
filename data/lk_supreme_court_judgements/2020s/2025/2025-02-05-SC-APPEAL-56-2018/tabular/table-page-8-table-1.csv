"","Respondents were later placed in possession. In other words, there is an indecisiveness"
"","as to the land in dispute in the matter in section 66 application whether it is the 6-acre"
"","land which was directed to be handed over in MC Case No. 40725 or some other part"
"","of paddy land in the same paddy land called Hinchimulla.  Because of indefiniteness"
"","and ambiguity as to the land, it is not appropriate to use revisionary powers in favour"
"","of the Petitioner and such disputes has to be resolved through the partition action P30/96"
"","which is pending or through a competent Civil Court and not by revision applications."
"•","The  Petitioner  has  failed  to  name  some  of  the  parties  who  were  named  as  2nd  Party"
"","Respondents  in  the  Primary  Court  case,  namely  Gnanapala,  Saminona  Palliyaguru,"
"","Ranasinhage Dhammika, Gamini Palliyaguru and Upul Satharasinghe who were also"
"","beneficiaries of the Primary Court Order. This failure is a grave and fatal error in the"
"","revision application."
"•","The Petitioner has failed to reveal in the revision application, the institution of the"
"","Partition action No. P 30/96 to the whole land and the fact that a restraining order was"
"","in force against her prohibiting the entry to the portion of paddyland which was"
"","possessed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Thus, the petitioner has not come with clean"
"","hands and is guilty of non-disclosing the material facts and it is fatal to the revision"
"","application."
"•","There are alternative remedies available such as the Partition action which was pending"
"","and/or  any  other  remedy  through  an  action  in  a  competent  civil  court.  As  such,"
"","exceptional circumstances should be established to grant remedies in revision to avoid"
"","irremediable harm but the Petitioner has failed in establishing such grounds."
"•","If only 6 acres were handed over to the Petitioner and the Petitioner attempts to hold"
"","the entire paddy land, she cannot be treated as one with clean hands."
"•","A  doubt  has  arisen  whether  the  Petitioner  has  obtained  the  stay  order  against  the"
"","execution of the order of the Primary Court while knowing that order has been already"
"","executed."
