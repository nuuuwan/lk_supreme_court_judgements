"If one misuses or abuse the power of a court, it is using force of law unlawfully and possession"
"gained by such means has to be considered forcible and unlawful. Thus, there was a situation"
"to be resolved by a proper court or a forum as to the possession of land and as such the Primary"
"Court had jurisdiction to intervene and make suitable order to maintain peace."
"The Petitioner endeavour to highlight in their written submissions that the dispossession was"
"done  by  the  fiscal  officer  on  a  directive  given  by  a  court  and  as  such  there  is  no  forcible"
"possession, and forcible possession is such that it has to be taken place against the will of the"
"persons who are entitled to possess and without the authority of law. The Petitioner highlights"
"that according to fiscal’s report it was a peaceful handing over of possession. The Petitioner"
"further argues that if the Respondents are aggrieved, they must go to the same court and seek"
"relief and that a parallel court has no power to set aside or over rule an order made according"
"to  law.  Referring  to  Mansoor  V  OIC  Avissawella  (1991)  2  Sri  L  R  75  and  Velupillai  v"
"Sivanathan (1993) 1 Sri L R 123, the Petitioner contends that if there is specific remedy and"
"/or specific tribunal created to hear and /or enforcement of an dispute, parties must resort to"
"such Tribunal and as such the procedure laid down by Agrarian laws was the remedy for the"
"dispute  between  the  landlord  and  the  tenant  cultivator  and  accordingly  one  cannot  use  the"
"Primary Courts Procedure Act to nullify the directive given by the Magistrate in terms of the"
"application  made  by  the  Commissioner.  In  this  regard  the  Petitioner  brings  the  attention  of"
"Court to section 98 of the Agrarian Development Act."
"Even  though  the  Petitioner  now  attempts  to  take  up  the  possession  that  the  dispossession"
"through a Court order cannot be the foundation for a breach of peace as contemplated in an"
"action under section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, I have already explained above"
"that misuse or abuse of  the enforcement of an order may contribute to initiate a situation of"
"forcible possession  in  certain  occasions and thus  may be the ground for breach of peace as"
"required for the commencement of section 66 action. On the other hand, as stated above, the"
"Petitioner herself in her affidavit filed in the section 66 action, without making any objection"
"to exercising the powers under section 66 on the basis that there is no breach of peace that can"
"be considered in terms of that section, had moved the Primary Court to intervene and grant"
"relief while clearly stating that there was a dispute causing breach of peace that falls under the"
"aforesaid section 66- Vide paragraph 6 and prayer of the affidavit dated 06.07.2001 filed by"
"the Petitioner in MC No.43361. If she took up this position in the Primary Court the opposite"
"parties could have placed more relevant facts to meet such stance which would have helped the"
"original Courts as well as this Court. The Petitioner cannot be allowed to change her position"
"and move for revision on that ground. On the other hand, if the execution of an order exceeds"
"the power given by the order itself and the outcome affects the rights of third parties, to that"
"extent it cannot be said that such deprivation of rights is within the authority of law. It is true"
"that the fiscal officer’s report in MC No 42705 indicated a peaceful handing over of possession"
"but  it  must  be  noted  that  neither  the  Commissioner  nor  the  Magistrate  Court  nor  the  fiscal"
"officer gave notice of eviction to the 2nd Party Respondents in case no. 43361; nor they were"
"present at the occasion to present their objection for the eviction of them from the land on the"
"basis of an order against another person. Thus, the dispute and the breach of peace could have"
"arisen  only  when  the  said  2nd  Party  Respondents  came  to  know  that  the  Petitioner  was  in"
"possession claiming through an execution of an order of Court. As explained earlier, there is"
"no provision in the Agrarian Development Act which is similar to section 325 or 328 of the"
"Civil Procedure Code for any aggrieved third party to make claims based on their rights if they"
