"The aforesaid questions of laws allowed, do not focus on two factors considered by the relevant"
"High Court judge in dismissing the revision application. First being the failure to name certain"
"necessary parties of the 2nd Party Respondents as mentioned above to the revision application."
"As stated earlier in  this decision, revision application, which is  not a direct  appeal,  is  not  a"
"continuation of the Primary Court case filed in this regard. Any default in appearing or making"
"representation in the Primary Court cannot be a reason not to make the said parties who get the"
"benefit  of  the  Primary  Court  Judgment.  As  said  before,  Revision  application  was  a  new"
"application  originated  in  the  High  Court  itself.    The  learned  High  Court  Judge  referring  to"
"section 66(8) (b) of the Act has clearly pointed out that defaulter is not entitled to participate"
"at the inquiry before the Primary Court but the Primary Court has to consider the facts before"
"the court in coming to a decision. If that Court has come to a decision favourable even to the"
"defaulters,  in  my  view,  it  is  the  duty  of  the  Petitioner  to  make  them  party  to  the  revision"
"application as  it is  not  a continuation of the original  action and the decision may affect  the"
"rights of the said parties."
"The second factor that has not been focused in the questions of law mentioned above is the"
"non-disclosure  of  the  material  facts  by  the  Petitioner  in  her  petition  to  the  High  Court,"
"especially the fact that there is a partition action pending for the larger land where a restraining"
"order was made against the Petitioner not to enter into portion of the paddy land enjoyed by"
"some of the Respondents. This is material because the cause for the breach of peace appeared"
"to have been arisen due to the fact that the Petitioner allegedly have taken into her possession"
"by misleadingly showing the boundaries of a land exceeding the entitlement as stated in the"
"Magistrate Court order or after the execution of that order deceptively grabbing possession of"
"the lands possessed by the Respondents in the guise that they were handed over to him through"
"the execution of that order. Therefore, as contended by the 2nd Party Respondents, the dispute"
"has arisen due to the aforesaid acts of the Petitioner when there is a pending partition action"
"with a restraining order against the Petitioner and not per se through the correct execution of"
"the Magistrate Court’s order in MC No. 42705."
"Answers to the Questions of Law mentioned above"
"It is true that a dispossession caused through a court order per se under normal circumstances"
"cannot be considered as an instance that may give rise to a breach of peace that paves way for"
"an application in terms of section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act. If it is considered so,"
"no  court  order  could  be  implemented.  However,  if  it  is  done  in  abuse  of  process  or  not  in"
"accordance with the order made or against people who does not contemplate in the said order,"
"it may give rise to new causes of action or disputes that may have to be resolved through a"
"competent Court or a forum. As such, if breach of peace occurs and if it is a dispute involving"
"land, till that is resolved, the Primary Court may get jurisdiction in terms of section 66 of the"
"Primary Courts Procedure Act to involve and make appropriate order in accordance with the"
"law to maintain peace unless it is specifically prohibited by law. As explained above, abuse or"
"misuse of the process of Court may create situation of forcible possession by dispossession of"
"the person who is entitled to possess, without authority of law. In the matter at hand, the 2nd"
"Party Respondents were not the party to be evicted in terms of the Magistrate Court’s order in"
"Case No.42705 and there was no clarity as to the proper identification of the land in executing"
"the said order."
