"However,  among  the  issues  that  were  raised  before  the  trial  Court  there"
"was  no 
issue  on 
the  servitudes  and 
the 
relevant  principles  of 
law,"
"regarding  the  right  of  way.  Of  the  four  issues  raised  by  the  Defendants"
"were  on  the  points;  whether  the  Plaintiff  used  his  Eastern  boundary  to"
"have access to his land; whether the Plaintiff used the disputed roadway at"
"any  point  of 
time;  whether 
the  disputed 
roadway 
is  used  by 
the"
"Defendants  to  have  egress  and  ingress  to  their  respective  houses;  and  if"
"any of these issues are answered in the negative, should the action of the"
"Plaintiff be dismissed made no reference to any other point. Interestingly,"
"the  Defendants  also  failed  to  raise  any  issues  on  the  principle  of  law  of"
"abandonment of servitude, or on prescription."
