"S.C. Appeal No. 217/2014"
"It is correct that Deed No. 1391 (P10), being executed on 07.02.1969,"
"is  the  oldest  of  the  deeds  that  were  tendered  before  the  trial  Court.  The"
"vendor,  named  in  the  said  instrument,  Henry  Edward  Clive  Goonesekera,"
"states in its page 2, “ … the vendor caused 7 divided portions marked Lots 1, 2,"
"3,  4,  5,  6,  and  7  depicted  in  Plan  No.  693C  dated  26.12.1968  made  by  C.C."
"Wickramasinghe, Licensed surveyor, …”. Thus, when he granted right of way"
"over Lot No. 7 of Plan No. 693C, had the soil rights over that Lot No. 7 and"
"therefore could grant such a servitude on that road reservation."
