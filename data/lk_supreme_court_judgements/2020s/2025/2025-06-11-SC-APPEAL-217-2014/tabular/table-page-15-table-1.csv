"S.C. Appeal No. 217/2014"
"The  report  and  the  evidence  of  the  Licensed  Surveyor,  who  was"
"commissioned by Court to conduct a survey and report over the disputed"
"portion of the roadway, indicate that indeed it is so. Not only Lot No. 7 of"
"Plan No. 693C, but also the Lot No. A2 in Plan No. 518 was superimposed"
"during  the  preparation  of  the  commission  Plan  No.  C/343,  in  which  the"
"boundaries that were so superimposed from the two previous plans were"
"clearly  depicted  in  his  Plan  using  different  colours.  The  1st  Defendant,"
"during his cross examination of the licensed surveyor, had further clarified"
"this issue from him and the witness answered it in the affirmative."
