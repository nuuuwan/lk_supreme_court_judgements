"the  manner  in  which  the  right  of  way  he  attempts  to  establish  is  actually"
"described."
"The Plaintiff acquired title to Lot No. 2A of Plan No. 518, through a"
"Deed  of  Transfer  No.  943,  executed  on  18.11.1996  by  its  vendor  Stanly"
"Devaraj Moses. As already noted, Lot No. 2A is a part of Lot No. 2 depicted"
"in  Plan  No.  880  before  its  subdivision  made  by  Plan  No.2451,  forming  it"
"into two Lots bearing Lot Nos. 2A and 2B. It was Stanly Devaraj Moses, who"
"subdivided Lot 2 of Plan No. 880, after acquiring its title, through the Deed"
"of  Transfer  No.  555,  executed  on  23.07.1974.  A  section  of  the  roadway,"
"depicted as Lot No. A2 in Plan No. 518, is also shown in the Plan Nos. 880"
"and 2451 and described the same as a “reservation for road”."
"Thus, in establishing the right of way and its alleged obstruction by"
"the Defendant, the Plaintiff must place heavy reliance on the Deed No. 555,"
"by which his predecessor in title had obtained his bundle of rights over Lot"
"No. 2, depicted in Plan No. 880."
"The  vendor  of  the  Deed  of  Transfer  No.  555,  conveyed  his  rights"
"over Lot No. 2 of Plan No. 880, “… fully and particularly described in the First"
"Schedule hereto together with the right of way and user over the reservations for"
"roads in the Second Schedule hereto fully described” to its vendee Stanley Devraj"
"Moses  (emphasis  added).  The  Second  Schedule  to  the  said  Deed  makes  a"
"reference to “ [A]ll that divided allotment of land marked Lot A2 reservation for"
"a  road  (20  feet  wide)  in  Plan  No.  518  dated  18th  February  1967  made  by  C.C."
"Wickramasinghe, Licensed Surveyor …”."
"The  vendee  of  the  said  Deed  No.  555  (Stanley  Devraj  Moses),  after"
"subdividing Lot No.  2  of  Plan  No.  880,  by  Plan  No.  2451,  as  Lot Nos.  2A"
