"T","he Counsel for the 4th and 5th Respondents has referred to the above judgments in support of"
"the award made by the Arbitrator. However, the question is whether the aforesaid relaxation of",""

"T","he  Counsel  for  the  4th  and  5th  Respondents  further  relies  on  the  concept  of  legitimate"

"practice, undertaking or representation which is not lawful and/or ultra vires and/or contrary to",""
