"such is not the case for it seems to be more of a poster for propaganda"
"than a poster for notice as it doesn’t mention applications or a deadline"
"for applying."
"35. 
The notice published at the Magistrates Court on 13.03.2015 which"
"the  Respondents  contend  to  be  a  furthering  of  the  original  notice"
"published  by  way  of 
the  hoarding 
is  evidently  contrary 
to  due"
"procurement process as it was published well after the space allocations"
"were made for the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Respondents. I observe that in"
"the evidence forwarded in the form of receipt of payment marked “4R4”"
"where  the  refundable  payment  of  Rs.  150,000  was  made  by  the  4th"
"Respondent, the date is noted as 04.03.2015 affirming my conclusion"
"above  of  notice  being  published  well  after  certain  allocations  were"
"already made."

6. 
I have also observed that the six rooms that were already allocated"
"to the 4th – 7th Respondents are more strategically located, proximate to"
"the  Kurunegala  –  Anuradhapura  main  road.  The  Petitioners  have"
"contended that these first six rooms which they described as the “best”"
"rooms  being  allocated  without  prior  notice  is  a  grave  violation  of  due"
"process.  This  position 
is 
further  exacerbated  by  the 
fact  that  the"
"allocation of these spaces for the 5th – 7th Respondents was done for the"
"part payment of Rs. 50,000 instead of the required Rs. 150,000."
"37. 
A  part  payment  of  Rs.  50,000  instead  of  the  required  Rs.  150,000"
"was  made  by  the  14th  Respondent  on  the  13th  of  March  2015  upon"
"which space was allocated for her. Whereby although it may have been"
"allocated  after  the  publication of notice,  it  was  still  done  for  a partial"
"payment of Rs. 50,000 instead of the required Rs. 150,000. As the 1st –"
"4th Petitioners were barred from occupying these spaces even if the full"
"payment was to be made by them due to these allocations owing to part"
"payments, I am of the opinion that due procurement process has not"
"been followed."
"38. 
I must also note that the 4th Respondent was not only allocated three"
"rooms, but also was able to have no walls constructed between her three"
"rooms, which raises the possibility that the agreements were arrived at"
"prior 
to 
the  construction  of 
the  premises 
itself. 
In 
the  written"
"submissions of the Petitioners, the following statement uttered by the"
"4th  Respondent  as  noted 
in  the  minutes  of  the  meeting  held  on"
"13.03.2015 is noted."
