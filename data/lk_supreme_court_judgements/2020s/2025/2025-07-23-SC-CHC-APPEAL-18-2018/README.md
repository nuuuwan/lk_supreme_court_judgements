SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 4

Samayawardhena, J.

Background

The original petitioner instituted this action in the High Court of the

Western Province holden in Colombo in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction

(conveniently known as Commercial High Court in Colombo) on

13.10.2014 against five respondents seeking substantive reliefs on

oppression (section 224 of the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007) and

mismanagement of the affairs of the 1st respondent company (section 225

of the same Act). Pending determination of the substantive reliefs, the

petitioner sought several interim reliefs.

After inquiry, the High Court by its order dated 22.04.2015 issued an

interim order against the 1st to 4th respondents restraining them from

preventing the petitioner from acting as a director of the 1st respondent

company as prayed for in paragraph (l) of the prayer to the petition upon

depositing a sum of Rs. 500,000 as security. The petitioner complained to

the High Court by petition and affidavit dated 07.07.2015 together with

summons, charge sheet and annexures that the 1st and 2nd respondents

violated the said interim order and therefore they shall be punished for

contempt of court.

Upon service of process, the 1st respondent moved to have the application

dismissed in limine, contending that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to

entertain the matter, as the alleged contempt was ex facie curiae (committed

out of court) and the Companies Act contains no provision conferring

jurisdiction to punish for such contempt. In essence, the argument

advanced by the 1st respondent was that the contempt jurisdiction of the

Commercial High Court is limited to contempts committed in facie curiae (in

the face of the court), and does not extend to contempts committed out of

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 5

court, unless a statutory provision expressly provides that such act is

punishable as contempt of court.

The High Court, by its order dated 08.12.2015, overruled the preliminary

objection raised by the 1st respondent and decided to proceed with the

contempt application. Dissatisfied with this order, the 1st respondent

invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this court by way of a leave to appeal

application. This court granted leave to appeal on the following question of

law:

Has the High Court exercising civil jurisdiction in terms of Act No. 10 of

1996 power to hear and determine an application for contempt in

relation to an alleged violation of an interim order issued by that court?

As the impugned order was delivered on 08.12.2015, this question must be

examined in light of the law relating to contempt of court as it stood on that

date.

Contempt of court may broadly be defined as any act or omission that

interferes with or obstructs the due administration of justice, impairs or

diminishes the authority and dignity of the court, or tends to undermine

public confidence in the judicial process. It encompasses conduct

committed both in the face of the court (in facie curiae) and out of court (ex

facie curiae). The object of the contempt jurisdiction is not the vindication

of the personal dignity of judges, but the preservation of judicial authority

for the protection of the general public and the integrity of the

administration of justice.

I must state that the law relating to contempt of court has historically been

a complex area, lacking a clear definition in both substantive and

procedural aspects, with relevant provisions dispersed across multiple legal

instruments, including the Constitution, the Judicature Act, the Penal

Code, the Civil Procedure Code, and the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 6

Several statutes recognise specific acts and omissions as being punishable

as contempt of court. For instance, several provisions of the Civil

Procedure Code expressly identify certain acts and omissions as

constituting offences of contempt. These include sections 103(4), 103(12),

109(2), 137(2), 140, 183B, 295, 330, 358, 372, 663, 713(3), 717(1), 718(3),

and 724A(3). Reference may also be made to Chapter X of the Penal Code,

titled Of Contempts of the Lawful Authority of Public Servants, which

comprises sections 170 to 187 and sets out a series of offences that may, in

appropriate cases, amount to contempt of court. In terms of section 19 of

the Penal Code, the term public servant includes every judge. As another

example, section 53 of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, confers contempt

jurisdiction on the District Court in the context of partition actions.

Before the enactment of such statutory provisions, the subject of contempt

of court was largely governed by English common law principles. The

complexity of the law has been compounded by the differing interpretations

given by the courts to the relevant statutory provisions, and further

complicated by the varying ways in which those judicial dicta have been

understood and applied by members of the legal profession. With the

enactment of the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act, No. 8 of

2024 (hereinafter sometimes Contempt of Court Act of 2024), the law

governing contempt of court has now been consolidated and streamlined,

thereby bringing greater clarity, consistency and coherence to this area of

the law. This does not mean that there is no room or need for further

improvement.

However, there remain numerous pending cases that must be addressed in

accordance with the law as it stood prior to the passage of the Contempt of

Court Act of 2024. Accordingly, it is not a futile exercise to set out the law

as it existed prior to the enactment of the Act, as it remains pertinent to the

resolution of the pending matters, including the instant appeal.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 7

The specific question that arises for determination in this appeal is whether

the Commercial High Court has jurisdiction to punish for contempt arising

from the alleged violation of interim orders issued under the Companies Act.

In order to answer this question, it is necessary to consider the source from

which the Commercial High Court derives its contempt jurisdiction.

I must make it clear that in this judgment, I do not propose to address the

contempt jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, except

where it becomes necessary to elucidate a point concerning the contempt

jurisdiction of courts of first instance, including the High Courts.

Source of contempt jurisdiction of the High Court

Article 105(3) of the Constitution reads as follows:

The Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal

of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall each be a superior court of record and

shall have all the powers of such court including the power to punish

for contempt of itself, whether committed in the court itself or

elsewhere, with imprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem

fit. The power of the Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish

for contempt of any other court, tribunal or institution referred to in

paragraph (1)(c) of this Article, whether committed in the presence of

such court or elsewhere:

Provided that the preceding provisions of this Article shall not prejudice

or affect the rights now or hereafter vested by any law in such other

court, tribunal or institution to punish for contempt of itself.

Article 105(3)(1)(c) mentioned therein refers to the High Court of the

Republic of Sri Lanka and such other Courts of First Instance, tribunals or

such institutions as Parliament may from time to time ordain and establish.

Article 111(1) of the Constitution, as originally stood, read as follows:

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 8

The highest Court of First Instance exercising criminal jurisdiction and

created by law shall be called and known as The High Court of the

Republic of Sri Lanka and shall exercise such jurisdiction and powers

as Parliament may by law vest or ordain.

At that time, the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka exercised only

criminal jurisdiction.

Article 111(1) was amended by the 11th Amendment to the Constitution to

read as follows:

There shall be a High Court of Sri Lanka, which shall exercise such

jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may by law vest or ordain.

Article 111 was further amended by the 17th Amendment to the

Constitution. Article 111 now reads as follows:

111(1) There shall be a High Court of Sri Lanka, which shall exercise

such jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may by law vest or ordain.

(2) The Judges of the High Court shall

(a) on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission,

be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and

such recommendation shall be made after consultation with the

Attorney-General;

(b) be removable and be subject to the disciplinary control of the

President on the recommendation of the Judicial Service

Commission.

(3) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Article, Parliament

may by law provide for matters relating to the retirement of the Judge

of such High Court.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 9

(4) Any Judge of the High Court may resign his office by writing under

his hand addressed to the President.

Article 154P of the Constitution introduced by the 13th Amendment to the

Constitution provided for the establishment of a High Court for each

Province, commonly known as the Provincial High Court, to exercise

jurisdiction within the Province.

Article 154P of the Constitution reads as follows:

154P (1) There shall be a High Court for each Province with effect from

the date on which this Chapter comes into force. Each such High Court

shall be designated as the High Court of the relevant Province.

(2) The Chief Justice shall nominate from among Judges of the High

Court of Sri Lanka such number of Judges as may be necessary to each

such High Court. Every such Judge shall be transferable by the Chief

Justice.

(3) Every such High Court shall

(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal jurisdiction of

the High Court of Sri Lanka in respect of offences committed

within the Province;

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any

law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province;

(c) exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament

may, by law, provide.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 10

(4) Every such High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue, according to

law

(a) orders in the nature of habeas corpus, in respect of persons

illegally detained within the Province; and

(b) order in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against any person

exercising, within the Province, any power under

(i) any law; or

(ii) any statutes made by the Provincial Council

established for that Province, in respect or any matter set

out in the Provincial Council List.

(5) The Judicial Service Commission may delegate to such High Court,

the power to inspect and report on, the administration of any Court of

First Instance within the Province.

(6) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any

person aggrieved by a final order, judgment or sentence of any such

Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under paragraphs (3)(b) or (3)(c)

or (4), may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal in accordance with

Article 138.

Section 2 of the Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978, as amended by Judicature

(Amendment) Act, No. 34 of 2022, reads as follows:

2. The Courts of First Instance for the administration of justice in the

Republic of Sri Lanka shall be

(a) the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka;

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 11

(b) the High Courts for the Provinces established by Article 154P of

the Constitution;

(c) the District Courts;

(d) the Family Courts;

(e) the Small Claims Courts;

(f) the Magistrates Courts; and

(g) the Primary Courts.

It may be noted that although the 11th Amendment to the Constitution

amended Article 111(1) by substituting the term High Court of Sri Lanka

for High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka, there is no distinct court

referred to as the High Court of Sri Lanka in section 2 of the Judicature

Act.

It is important to note that, in terms of Article 111(2) of the Constitution,

Judges are appointed by the President as Judges of the High Court of Sri

Lanka. The Constitution does not contain a separate provision for the

appointment of Judges specifically as Judges of the High Court of the

Republic of Sri Lanka or as Judges of the Provincial High Courts established

under Article 154P.

Under Article 154P(2) of the Constitution, the Chief Justice shall nominate

from among the Judges of the High Court of Sri Lanka such number of

Judges as may be necessary to each High Court of the Province. In other

words, Provincial High Court Judges are Judges of the High Court of Sri

Lanka, and they have been nominated to the Provinces by the Chief Justice

for administrative purposes.

At present, there are no High Courts sitting under the designation High

Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka or High Court of Sri Lanka. All High

Court Judgeswhether exercising criminal, civil, commercial jurisdiction,

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 12

or sitting at the Permanent High Court at Barfunction as Judges of the

High Courts of the Provinces.

Although the Permanent High Court at Bar, introduced by the Judicature

(Amendment) Act, No. 9 of 2018 by amending section 12 of the Judicature

Act, is also a Provincial High Court established under Article 154P of the

Constitution, section 12A(1)(a) of the Judicature Act provides that such a

Permanent High Court at Bar shall consist of three Judges sitting together,

nominated by the Chief Justice from among the Judges of the High Court of

the Republic of Sri Lanka.

12A(1)(a) Notwithstanding anything in any other written law, the High

Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a Province

shall, in terms of sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph (3) of Article 154P of

the Constitution hear, try and determine in the manner provided for by

written law and subject to the provisions of subsection (4), prosecutions

on indictment against any person, in respect of financial and economic

offences specified in the Sixth Schedule to this Act, and any other

offence committed in the course of the same transaction of any such

offence, with three Judges sitting together nominated by the Chief

Justice from among the Judges of the High Court of the Republic of Sri

Lanka (hereinafter referred to as the Permanent High Court at Bar).

According to section 16 of the Contempt of Court Act of 2024:

Court of First Instance means, the High Court of the Republic of Sri

Lanka, the High Court for a Province established by Article 154P of the

Constitution, the District Court, the Family Court, the Small Claims

Court, the Magistrates Court or the Primary Court.

It is quite evident that the terms High Court of Sri Lanka and High Court

of the Republic of Sri Lanka are used interchangeably to refer to the same

judicial body.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 13

Article 154P(3) of the Constitution states:

Every Provincial High Court shall

(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal jurisdiction of the

High Court of Sri Lanka in respect of offences committed within the

Province;

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law,

exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates

Courts and Primary Courts within the Province;

(c) exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may, by

law, provide.

It is by virtue of the enabling provision contained in Article 154P(3)(c) of the

Constitution that different types of Provincial High Courts, including the

Permanent High Court at Bar, have been established.

The first category of High Court of the Provinces established under Article

154P of the Constitution was created by the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990. The preamble to this Act states:

An Act to make provision regarding the procedure to be followed in, and the

right to appeal to, and from, the High Court established under Article 154P of

the Constitution; and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

This Provincial High Court primarily exercises criminal jurisdiction.

By the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act,

No. 54 of 2006, section 5 of Act, No. 19 of 1990 was amended by the

insertion of subsections 5A to 5D, whereby appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of judgments and orders delivered by any District

Court or Family Court within such Province was conferred on the Provincial

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 14

High Court. This category of Provincial High Court primarily exercises civil

appellate jurisdiction.

The High Courts of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996

introduced High Courts to exercise original civil jurisdiction in specific

commercial matters, commonly referred to as Commercial High Courts.

The preamble of the High Courts of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act,

No. 10 of 1996 reads as follows: An Act to provide for the exercise, by High

Courts established by Article 154P of the Constitution, of jurisdiction to hear

and determine certain civil actions and matters.

Section 2(1) of Act, No. 10 of 1996 reads as follows:

Every High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a

Province shall, with effect from such date as the Minister may, by Order

published in the Gazette appoint, in respect of such High Court have

exclusive jurisdiction and shall have cognizance of and full power to

hear and determine, in the manner provided for by written law, all

actions, applications and proceedings specified in the First Schedule to

this Act, if the party or parties defendant to such action resides or

reside, or the cause of action has arisen, or the contract sought to be

enforced was made, or in the case of applications or proceedings under

the Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982 the registered office of the Company

is situated, within the province for which such High Court is

established.

In terms of section 2(1) of Act No. 10 of 1996, read with the First Schedule

thereto, the High Courts established under this Act have exclusive

jurisdiction, inter alia, to entertain applications instituted under the

Companies Act.

Section 529 of the Companies Act, No. 7 of 2007 states:

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 15

the court means a High Court established under Article 154P of the

Constitution for a Province, empowered with civil jurisdiction by Order

published in the Gazette under section 2 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996, within the Province

for which such High Court is established, or where no such High Court

vested with such civil jurisdiction is established for any Province, the

High Court established for the Western Province.

There can be no dispute that the High Courts established under Act No. 10

of 1996 are a species of Provincial High Courts established under Article

154P of the Constitution.

On behalf of the 1st respondent, it was submitted that the Companies Act

contains no provision analogous to section 663 of the Civil Procedure Code

in respect of violations of interim orders issued by the Commercial High

Court under the Companies Act, and therefore, the Commercial High Court

lacks jurisdiction to deal with such violations by way of contempt. Although

the Commercial High Court is a court of first instance, it is not a District

Court, but a Provincial High Court. As I shall explain below, it is not

necessary for the Companies Act to expressly declare particular acts or

omissions as constituting contempt of court in order for a Provincial High

Court established under Act No. 10 of 1996 to exercise its contempt

jurisdiction in respect of such violations. Even prior to the Contempt of

Court Act of 2024, all Provincial High Courts were vested with jurisdiction

to punish for contempt committed both in facie curiae and ex facie curiae.

I have already made it clear by quoting section 12A(1)(a) of the Judicature

Act that Permanent High Court at Bar is also a species of Provincial High

Courts established under Article 154P of the Constitution.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 16

Section 2(3) of Act No. 19 of 1990, the first Act that set out the procedure

to be followed in the High Courts established under Article 154P of the

Constitution, states:

The provisions of the Judicature Act shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to

offences of contempt committed against, or in disrespect of the

authority of a High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution.

The provisions of the Judicature Act that apply to offences of contempt

committed against, or in disrespect of, the authority of a High Court are

contained in section 18, which reads as follows:

The High Court shall have power and authority to take cognizance of

and try in a summary manner any offence of contempt committed

against or in disrespect of its authority, and on conviction to commit the

offender to jail for a period not exceeding five years. Such imprisonment

shall be simple or rigorous as the court shall direct and the offender

may, in addition thereto, or in lieu thereof, in the discretion of the court

be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding five thousand rupees.

According to section 18 of the Judicature Act, the High Court is vested with

jurisdiction to try in a summary manner any offence of contempt committed

against or in disrespect of its authority. The phrase any offence of contempt

committed against or in disrespect of its authority is couched in broad terms

and encompasses both forms of contempt: in facie curiae and ex facie curiae.

This interpretation becomes clearer when one considers (a) the legislative

history of the provision and (b) contrasts the contempt jurisdiction

conferred on the High Court with that of the District Court, the Family

Court, the Small Claims Court, the Magistrates Court and the Primary

Court.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 17

Section 55 of the Judicature Act, which deals with the contempt jurisdiction

of the District Court, the Family Court, the Small Claims Court, the

Magistrates Court and the Primary Court, reads as follows:

55(1) Every District Court, Family Court, Small Claims Court,

Magistrates Court and Primary Court shall, for the purpose of

maintaining its proper authority and efficiency, have a special

jurisdiction to take cognizance of, and to punish with the penalties in

that behalf as hereinafter provided, every offence of contempt of court

committed in the presence of the court itself and all offences which are

committed in the course of any act or proceeding in the said court

respectively, and which are declared by any law for the time being in

force to be punishable as contempt of court.

(2) The following sentences of fines or imprisonment as the case may

be, may be imposed on conviction for contempt by the following courts

respectively, namely

(a) by a District Court and Family Court a fine not exceeding two

thousand five hundred rupees or imprisonment, either simple or

rigorous, for a period not exceeding two years;

(b) by a Small Claims Court and Magistrates Court a fine not exceeding

one thousand five hundred rupees or imprisonment either simple or

rigorous, for a period not exceeding eighteen months; and

(c) by a Primary Court a fine not exceeding five hundred rupees or

imprisonment, either simple or rigorous, for a period not exceeding

three months.

Unlike the jurisdiction of the High Court, the jurisdiction of the District

Court, the Family Court, the Small Claims Court, the Magistrates Court

and the Primary Court in contempt matters was limited, except where the

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 18

contempt was committed in facie curiae. In order for the District Court, the

Family Court, the Small Claims Court, the Magistrates Court and the

Primary Court to assume jurisdiction in cases of contempt ex facie curiae,

the act in question must have constituted an offence declared by any law

for the time being in force to be punishable as contempt of court. There was

no such limitation to the High Court.

According to section 55(1) of the Judicature Act, the District Court, the

Family Court, the Small Claims Court, the Magistrates Court and the

Primary Court have jurisdiction in respect of:

(a) every offence of contempt of court committed in the presence of the

court itself; and

(b) all offences which are committed in the course of any act or proceeding

in the said court respectively, and which are declared by any law for

the time being in force to be punishable as contempt of court.

All other offences of contempt of court, falling outside the scope of section

55(1), was to be dealt with by the Court of Appeal in the exercise of its

jurisdiction under Article 105(3) of the Constitution.

Legislative history

Let me now trace, to some extent, the legislative history of the contempt

jurisdiction to further underscore that the High Courts were empowered to

punish for contempt committed both in facie curiae and ex facie curiae.

Section 47 of the Courts Ordinance, No. 1 of 1889, as amended, read as

follows:

The Supreme Court or any Judge thereof, whether at Colombo or

elsewhere, shall have full power and authority to take cognizance of

and to try in a summary manner any offence of contempt committed

against or in disrespect of the authority of itself or offence of contempt

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 19

committed against or in disrespect of the authority of any other court,

and which such court has not jurisdiction under section 57 to take

cognizance of and punish, and on conviction to commit the offender to

jail until he shall have purged his contempt or for such period as to the

court or Judge shall seem meet; and such imprisonment shall be simple

or rigorous as such court or Judge shall direct, and the offender may

in addition thereto or in lieu thereof, in the discretion of such court or

Judge, be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding five thousand rupees.

Section 57 of the Courts Ordinance read as follows:

Every District Court, Court of Requests, and Magistrates Court shall,

for the purpose of maintaining its proper authority and efficiency, have

a special jurisdiction to take cognizance of, and to punish by the

procedure and with the penalties in that behalf by law provided, every

offence of contempt of court committed in the presence of the court itself,

and all offences which are committed in the course of any act or

proceeding in the said courts respectively, and which are declared by

any law for the time being in force to be punishable as contempts of

court.

It may be observed that the language used in section 47 of the Courts

Ordinance, which delineated the contempt jurisdiction of the Supreme

Court, is similar to that used in section 18 of the Judicature Act, which

delineates the contempt jurisdiction of the High Court. Likewise, section 57

of the Courts Ordinance corresponds to section 55(1) of the Judicature Act.

It is relevant to note that at the time these provisions were enacted:

(a) in terms of section 19 of the Courts Ordinance, the Supreme Court

was exercising original jurisdiction as well as appellate jurisdiction;

(b) in terms of section 2 of the Courts Ordinance, Supreme Court was

also an original court when sitting in its original jurisdiction;

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 20

(c) according to section 7 of the Courts Ordinance, the Supreme Court

was the only superior court of record;

(d) the Supreme Court was not the final appellate court in the judicial

hierarchy, the ultimate appellate authority being the Judicial

Committee of the Privy Council in England.

There is no dispute that the Supreme Court referred to above had all the

powers for punishing for contempt committed both in facie curiae and ex

facie curiae.

In the case of In Re R.C.O. De La Motte (1959) 61 NLR 121, a licensed

surveyor who was a member of the panel of surveyors in the District Court

of Kandy, in disobedience of the courts order, returned the commission

issued to him unexecuted, stating that the Judges have not found it

possible to accede to the requests made in the joint letters dated 25th

November and 13th December 1957 signed by all the surveyors of Kandy

Courts. The District Judge brought the matter to the notice of the Supreme

Court and the Supreme Court issued a rule nisi on the respondent surveyor

requiring him to show cause, if any, why he should not be punished for the

offence of contempt of court. The argument advanced on behalf of the

respondent that, on the facts of that case, the Supreme Court did not have

jurisdiction to punish for contempt of court was rejected by Chief Justice

Basnayake stating at page 125 as follows:

The main submission of respondents counsel is that the act of the

respondent does not fall within the ambit of section 47 [of the Courts

Ordinance]. That section is a provision of wide import. The legislature

in its wisdom did not attempt to define the offence of contempt because

it would have been unwise to do so. A definition in the statute itself

would have had the effect of restricting the scope of the unfettered

jurisdiction now vested in this Court in the interests of the efficient

administration of justice. The scope of the section is to be found in the

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 21

words any offence of contempt committed against or in disrespect of

the authority of itself or any offence of contempt committed against or

in disrespect of the authority of any other court. The expression

contempt of court is one derived from English law and in that system

of law it is contempt for any person to do any act which may tend to

hinder the course of justice or show disrespect to the Courts authority

(Sweets Law Dictionary).

As held by the Full Bench of the Supreme Court in The King v. Samarawira

(1917) 19 NLR 433 at 437, even before the enactment of the Courts

Ordinance in 1889, the Supreme Court, as the superior court of record, had

jurisdiction to punish for contempts committed in facie curiae and ex facie

curiae.

The District Courts established under the Charter of 1883 have always

been regarded as Courts of Record, and notwithstanding the absence

of direct authority in the charters and rules to deal with cases of

contempt, such a jurisdiction was frequently exercised by them as

being an inherent power, and in the case In the Matter of the

Application of John Ferguson for a Writ of Prohibition against the

District Judge of Colombo (1874) 1 NLR 181 the Full Court held that,

although the District Courts, being Courts of Record, had an inherent

power to punish summarily contempts in the face of the Court, which

included any insult to the Judge while in the discharge of his duties,

such as interruption of the proceedings of the Court, disobedience to its

lawful orders or process, obstruction to its officers in the execution of

its process or orders, and other acts of a like nature. Yet, being Inferior

Courts of Record, they had not the full jurisdiction to punish all

descriptions of contempt such as is possessed by the Superior Courts

in England and the Supreme Court in Ceylon.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 22

The Courts Ordinance was repealed by section 3(1) of the Administration of

Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973.

Section 41 of the Administration of Justice Law governed the law relating

to contempt of court applicable to all courts.

41(1) Every District Court and Magistrates Court may, for the purpose

of maintaining its proper authority and efficiency, take cognizance of,

and punish in accordance with law, every offence of contempt of court

committed in the presence of the court itself, and any offence which is

committed in the course of any act or proceeding in such court and

which is declared by any law to be punishable as a contempt of court.

(2) Every High Court may take cognizance of and try in a summary

manner any offence of contempt committed against or in disrespect of

its authority or any offence of contempt committed within its jurisdiction

against or in disrespect of the authority of any other court or other

institution established by law which such court or institution has not

the jurisdiction to take cognizance of and punish, and on conviction

impose a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding five years or a fine

not exceeding five thousand rupees or both such imprisonment and

fine.

(3) The Supreme Court may take cognizance of and try in a summary

manner any offence of contempt committed against or in disrespect of

its authority and on conviction may impose a sentence of imprisonment

not exceeding seven years or a fine not exceeding seven thousand

rupees or both such imprisonment and fine.

Section 41(1) of the Administration of Justice Law, which set out the

contempt jurisdiction of the District Court and the Magistrates Court,

employed language that was virtually identical to section 55(1) of the

Judicature Act. In the same vein, sections 41(2) and 41(3), which addressed

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 23

the contempt powers of the High Court and the Supreme Court,

respectively, were framed in terms almost identical to those of section 18 of

the Judicature Act.

Superior and inferior courts of record and contempt jurisdiction

Dr. K. Kanag-Isvaran, P.C. in his well-researched and illuminating article,

The Reception and Growth of Contempt Jurisdiction in the Law of Sri Lanka,

[2008] Vol. XIV, Part I, BASL Law Journal, page 1, expresses the view that:

The power of punishment for contempt thus conferred on the Provincial

High Court in my view is no different to the similar powers conferred

on all Inferior Courts of Record established under the previous regimes,

as opposed to the powers of contempt recognized in respect of Superior

Courts of Record.

While the article commands respect and offers invaluable insights into the

historical development of the contempt jurisdiction in Sri Lanka, I regret my

inability to subscribe to the view advanced therein, namely, that only

superior courts of record are vested with jurisdiction to punish for contempt

committed both in facie curiae and ex facie curiae, whereas Provincial High

Courts, being inferior courts of record, are empowered to punish only for

contempt committed in facie curiae, unless expressly authorised by statute

to deal with contempts committed ex facie curiae. According to this analysis,

this distinction is based on whether the court is a superior court or an

inferior court.

It therefore seems quite clear that from [the Charter of] 1801, to date

the distinction between Superior Courts of Record and Inferior Courts

of Record has been maintained, with the concomitant consequences in

respect of their respective contempt jurisdiction.

()

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 24

The High Courts established under the 13th Amendment for the

provinces, themselves were inferior Courts of Record.

()

The power of the Inferior Courts of Record to punish for contempt was

limited to contempts in facie Court and did not extend to such as those

committed out of Court, unless express statutory power was given for

that purpose.

Tracing the historical development of contempt jurisdiction in this island,

and referring inter alia to two leading local authoritiesIn Re Ferguson

(1874) 1 NLR 181 and The King v. Samarawira (1917) 19 NLR 433the

learned author repeats the same:

Firstly, that our law recognizes the concept of Courts of Record.

Secondly, that it constituted the Superior Courts of Record and Inferior

Courts of Record. Thirdly, Superior Courts of Record were recognized

as having the power to punish contempts, whether it be in facie or ex

facie curiae. Fourthly, the power of inferior Courts of Record to punish

for contempt was limited to those committed in facie curiae. They were

not vested with the power to punish for contempts in respects of acts

done out of court, unless expressly authorized by law in that behalf.

Then the learned author states:

These propositions of law have been carried over into subsequent

legislation in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in respect of the powers of court

to punish acts which are in contempt of court.

I find myself unable to agree that the aforesaid propositions of law have

been carried over into subsequent legislation in Sri Lanka, beginning with

the Courts Ordinance of 1889.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 25

The learned author adopts this viewwhile acknowledging both the

similarity in the language used in the relevant provisions of the Courts

Ordinance, the Administration of Justice Law, and the Judicature Act, and

the dissimilarity in the language governing the contempt jurisdiction of the

High Court and the District Court, as quoted aboveon the basis that this

has been the consistent approach adopted by the Supreme Court since its

decision in Ferguson (supra) decided in 1874.

Can it then be argued in view of the similarity of language used, in

section 18 of the Judicature Act and section 51 of the Courts Ordinance,

in contradistinction to the words of section 55(1) of the Judicature Act

in respect of District Courts, Small Claims Courts and Magistrates

Courts that, the High Courts have been conferred a contempt

jurisdiction similar to those of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the

Court of Appeal? I think not, for the reason that legal enactments and

judicial decisions since 1874 to date do recognize and emphasize the

distinction between Superior Courts and Inferior Courts and their

powers of contempt.

I accept that legal enactments since 1874 have recognised the traditional

distinction between superior courts and inferior courts, or more accurately,

superior courts of record and courts of first instance. However, having

regard to the legislative history which I quoted previously, I am unable to

accept that the legislature intended to confer contempt jurisdiction solely

on the basis whether the court is a superior court or inferior court. It is not

possible to follow the dicta or observations made in Ferguson, decided

primarily on English common law principles, without closely examining or

giving due weight to the statutory provisions that were enacted thereafter.

The Courts Ordinance, the Administration of Justice Law, and the

Judicature Act all contain provisions relating to the exercise of contempt

jurisdiction. There can be no doubt that these enactments are statutes in

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 26

pari materia insofar as the law of contempt is concerned. The relevant

provisions are couched in language that is virtually identical, and, in the

absence of a clear and unambiguous legislative intent to the contrary, they

must be construed harmoniously and consistently. A failure to do so would

offend well-established canons of statutory interpretation, which require

that statutes dealing with the same subject matter be read together to give

coherent effect to legislative intent.

It is observed that the following dicta of Chief Justice Samarakoon in Regent

International Hotels Ltd v. Cyril Gardiner and Others [1978-79-80] 1 Sri LR

278 at 288 is often erroneously cited in support of the proposition that the

contempt jurisdiction of the High Court is limited only to contempts

committed in facie curiae, on the basis that it is a court of first instance.

The jurisdiction of an inferior Court to punish for contempt is confined

to such contempts as are perpetrated in facie curiae and does not

extend to such as those committed out of Court unless express

statutory power is given for that purpose. When such power is given,

the offence would be assimilated to contempt proceedings and

regarded as a contempt. But generally speaking the power to punish

for contempt for acts committed not in facie curiae of an inferior

tribunal, is given to a superior court.

This is the principal argument of the 1st respondent appellant in the instant

appeal as well.

In Regent International Hotels Ltd case, Chief Justice Samarakoon was

concerned with the contempt jurisdiction of the District Court in relation to

a violation of an enjoining order issued by the District Court. The Supreme

Court did not have occasion to consider the application of section 18 of the

Judicature Act, nor the contempt jurisdiction of the High Courtwhether

the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka, the High Court of Sri Lanka,

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 27

or a High Court established under Article 154P of the Constitution. It must

be noted that Article 154P of the Constitution was introduced by the 13th

Amendment more than seven years after the decision in Regent International

Hotels Ltd was delivered. As I pointed out earlier, the decision, In Re

Ferguson cited by Chief Justice Samarakoon was decided on English

common law principles governing contempt, as that case was decided in

1874, even before the enactment of the Courts Ordinance.

In Merryl Perera v. Abeysuriya [1983] 2 Sri LR 293 at 294295, the contempt

in question arose from a violation of an interim injunction issued by the

District Court. In delivering judgment, Chief Justice Samarakoon inter alia

drew a distinction between the contempt jurisdiction of the High Court and

that of the District Court, and observed that the High Courtalthough an

inferior court of record and a court of first instanceexercised the contempt

jurisdiction that had previously been vested in the Supreme Court.

The history of this power in the Superior Courts to deal with offences

of contempt of other Courts is relevant. Section 47 of the Courts

Ordinance (Cap.6) gave the Supreme Court or any Judge thereof power

to take cognisance of and try in a summary manner any offence of

contempt committed against or in disrespect of the authority of itself or

in disrespect of the authority of any other Court and which such Court

has no jurisdiction under Section 57 to take cognisance of and punish

This power was conferred on the High Court by the provisions of the

Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973. Section 41(2) reads

thus

(2) Every High Court may take cognizance of and try in a summary

manner any offence of contempt committed against or in disrespect of

its authority or any offence of contempt committed within its jurisdiction

against or in disrespect of the authority of any other court or other

institution established by law which such court or institution has not

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 28

the jurisdiction to take cognizance of and punish, and on conviction

impose a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding five years or a fine

not exceeding five thousand rupees or both such imprisonment and

fine.

These two provisions impose a limit on the power conferred by stating

that in respect of the offence of contempt of any other Court, the power

can be exercised only if that other Court has no jurisdiction to take

cognizance of such contempt. The Constitution of 1978 conferred this

power on the Court of Appeal but placed no limitation as in the Courts

Ordinance and the Administration of Justice Law.

Whilst interpreting the proviso to Article 105 of the Constitutionwhich

states that Provided that the preceding provisions of this Article shall not

prejudice or affect the rights now or hereafter vested by any law in such other

court, tribunal or institution to punish for contempt of itselfHis Lordship

rightly observed at page 296 as follows:

The proviso is significant. It saves similar jurisdiction of other Courts.

In the result the Court of Appeal and the District Court had parallel

jurisdiction in respect of the offence of contempt [violation of an interim

injunction] as alleged in this case.

Uniform contempt jurisdiction under the Contempt of Court Act

With the enactment of the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act,

No. 8 of 2024, all courts of first instancenamely, the High Court of the

Republic of Sri Lanka, the High Court for a Province established under

Article 154P of the Constitution, the District Court, the Family Court, the

Small Claims Court, the Magistrates Court, and the Primary Courthave

been vested with jurisdiction to punish for contempt of court, whether such

contempt is committed in facie curiae or ex facie curiae. This position is

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 29

evident from the overall scheme of the Act, and particularly from sections

7(1), 11(1) and 15.

7(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, the

Courts of First Instance shall have the power to punish for contempt of

court committed in its presence or hearing or in the course of

proceedings in such Courts of First Instance, or any act which is

specified in this Act or in any other written law for the time being in

force as being punishable as contempt of court, subject to the provisions

of this Act.

According to section 7(1) of the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution

Act, No. 8 of 2024, notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law,

but subject to the provisions of the Act, the High Court, the District Court,

the Family Court, the Small Claims Court, the Magistrates Court, and the

Primary Court are vested with jurisdiction to punish for contempt of court

committed:

(a) in its presence; or

(b) in its hearing; or

(c) in the course of proceedings in such courts of first instance; or

(d) by any act which is specified in this Act as being punishable as

contempt of court; or

(e) by any act which is specified in any other written law for the time

being in force as being punishable as contempt of court.

As previously stated, in terms of section 55(1) of the Judicature Act, the

District Court is vested with jurisdiction in respect of:

(a) every offence of contempt of court committed in the presence of the

court itself; and

(b) all offences which are committed in the course of any act or

proceeding in the said court respectively, and which are declared by

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 30

any law for the time being in force to be punishable as contempt of

court.

However, under the new Contempt of Court Act of 2024, this formulation

has been altered. The clause all offences which are committed in the course

of any act or proceeding in the said court respectively, and which are declared

by any law for the time being in force to be punishable as contempt of court

in section 55(1) of the Judicature Act has been separated into distinct limbs

with the word or, which is a coordinating conjunction that introduces

alternatives.

In other words, under the new Contempt of Court Act of 2024, in order for

the District Court, the Family Court, the Small Claims Court, the

Magistrates Court and the Primary Court to assume jurisdiction in cases

of contempt ex facie curiae, the act need not necessarily be declared by any

other law for the time being in force to be punishable as contempt of court.

No doubt, it remains as one of the avenues for assuming jurisdiction, but it

is no longer the only avenue.

In addition to the acts which are declared by provisions of other statutes to

be punishable as contempts of court, section 3 of the Contempt of Court

Act of 2024 enumerates the acts deemed to be contempt of court. It is

undisputed that these acts set out in section 3 encompass both contempt

committed in facie curiae and ex facie curiae. Section 7(1) of the Act vests

all courts of first instance with the power to punish for contempt of court,

inter alia, in respect of any act which is specified in this Act as being

punishable as contempt of court.

Section 3 is couched in broad terms, reflecting a wide ambit of application,

but its scope is circumscribed by adequate safeguards intended to prevent

the arbitrary or excessive exercise of contempt powers.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 31

3(1) Save as provided for in any other written law and subject to the

provisions of the Constitution, any person who commits an act or

omission with intent to

(a) bring the authority of a court, tribunal or institution and

administration of justice into disrespect or disregard; or

(b) interfere with, or cause grave prejudice to the judicial process in

relation to any ongoing litigation,

commits contempt of a court, tribunal or institution, as the case may

be.

(2) Save as provided for in any other written law and subject to the

provisions of the Constitution, any person who does any of the

following acts commits contempt of a court, tribunal or institution, as

the case may be

(a) willful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order,

writ or other process of a court, tribunal or institution;

(b) willful breach of an undertaking given to a court, tribunal or

institution;

(c) expressing, pronouncing or publishing any matter that is false

which, or doing any other act which

(i) scandalizes or lowers the judicial authority or dignity of a

court, tribunal or institution;

(ii) gravely prejudices, or unlawfully interferes with, the due

course of any judicial proceeding; or

(iii) interferes with, or obstructs the administration of justice;

(d)

(i) use of any electronic device or other instrument for audio

or visual recording or both, in a court, tribunal or institution,

or bringing into a court, tribunal or institution any such device

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 32

or instrument for the purpose of audio or visual recording or

both, without the leave of the court, tribunal or institution

already obtained;

(ii) publication or transmission of an audio or a visual

recording or both, of a proceeding or part of a proceeding of a

court, tribunal or institution made by means of any electronic

device or other instrument, or any such recording derived

directly or indirectly from such device or instrument without

the leave of the court, tribunal or institution already obtained;

(iii) use of any electronic device or other instrument, or

publication or transmission of an audio or a visual recording

or both, of a proceeding of a court, tribunal or institution, in

contravention of any leave granted under sub-paragraph (i)

or sub-paragraph (ii); or

(iv) tampering, altering or falsifying any audio or visual

recording or both, of a proceeding of a court, tribunal or

institution; or

(e)

(i) interfere with the due administration of justice;

(ii) excite dissatisfaction in the minds of the public in regard

to a court, tribunal or institution; or

(iii) cast public suspicion on the administration of justice.

Section 11(1) of the Contempt of Court Act of 2024 reaffirms the position

that all courts of first instance are now vested with jurisdiction to deal with

contempts committed both in facie curiae and ex facie curiae.

11(1) Where a Court of First Instance takes cognizance of contempt of

court committed against, or in disrespect of the authority of, such Court

of First Instance, such Court of First Instance shall, subject to the

provisions of subsections (2) and (3), hear and determine such matter

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 33

in accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter LXV of the Civil

Procedure Code.

Uniform procedural framework for contempt of court

The Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act, No. 8 of 2024

introduces not only a uniform contempt jurisdiction but also a uniform

procedural framework for the exercise of such jurisdiction. This framework

applies to all courts of first instance, namely: the High Court of the Republic

of Sri Lanka, the High Court established under Article 154P of the

Constitution, the District Court, the Family Court, the Small Claims Court,

the Magistrates Court, and the Primary Court.

I have already referred to section 7(1) of the Act, which applies to contempt

committed both in facie curiae and ex facie curiae, subject to the provisions

of the Act. I reproduce it again here for convenience and emphasis:

7(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, the

Courts of First Instance shall have the power to punish for contempt of

court committed in its presence or hearing or in the course of

proceedings in such Courts of First Instance, or any act which is

specified in this Act or in any other written law for the time being in

force as being punishable as contempt of court, subject to the provisions

of this Act.

Section 7(2) of the Contempt of Court Act of 2024 states:

7(2) Where any Court of First Instance takes cognizance of contempt of

court referred to in subsection (1), such Court of First Instance shall

hear and determine such matter in accordance with the procedure set

out in section 11.

Section 11 of the Contempt of Court Act of 2024 reads as follows:

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 34

11(1) Where a Court of First Instance takes cognizance of contempt of

court committed against, or in disrespect of the authority of such Court

of First Instance, such Court of First Instance shall, subject to the

provisions of subsections (2) and (3), hear and determine such matter

in accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter LXV of the Civil

Procedure Code.

(2) Where the Judge of a Court of First Instance referred to in subsection

(1) acts under section 795 of the Civil Procedure Code, such Judge shall

inquire from the accused whether he wishes to be tried by a Judge

other than the Judge in whose presence or hearing the contempt of

court is alleged to have been committed.

(3) If the accused indicates to the Judge of such Court of First Instance,

in response to the inquiry under subsection (2), orally or in writing, that

he wishes to be tried by a Judge other than the Judge in whose

presence or hearing the contempt of court is alleged to have been

committed, such Judge shall cause the matter to be placed, together

with the minutes of the facts recorded by such Judge, before the Chief

Justice for such directions as the Chief Justice may think fit to issue

with regard to the hearing of the charge.

The procedure applicable to contempt of court, as set out in sections 792 to

800 of Chapter LXV of the Civil Procedure Code, titled Of Summary

Procedure in Respect of Contempts of Court, is as follows:

792. In all courts the summary procedure to be followed for the exercise

of the special jurisdiction to take cognizance of and to punish

summarily offences of contempt of court, and offences declared by this

Ordinance to be punishable as contempts of court, shall be that which

is prescribed in the sections next immediately following.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 35

793. The court shall issue a summons to the accused person in the form

No. 132 in the First Schedule or to the like effect, which summons shall

state shortly the nature of the alleged offence and the information or

grounds upon which the summons is issued, and shall require the

accused person to appear before the court on a day named in the

summons to answer the charge.

794. It shall be competent to the court simultaneously with issuing such

summons, or at any time after such summons has been issued, if it has

reason to believe that the attendance of the accused person at the time

appointed in the summons to answer the charge cannot otherwise be

secured, to issue a warrant for his arrest in the form No. 133 in the

First Schedule or to the like effect, which warrant shall recite the

issuing of the summons, and the day appointed therein for the hearing

of the charge, and shall command that the accused person after arrest

be kept in custody until that day, and be then brought before the court

to answer the charge in the summons:

Provided that the person arrested shall at any time after arrest be

enlarged upon sufficient security, to an amount endorsed on the

warrant by the court, either of the accused person's own bond or that

of another person, for his appearance in court on the day named in the

summons, being furnished to the officer in whose custody he is.

795. When the information upon which the charge is based is furnished

to the court, either wholly or in part, by the personal observation of the

Judge of the accused persons behaviour and language in his presence,

the Judge shall at the time record a minute of the facts so observed by

him, which shall be admissible as evidence at the hearing of the

charge, and in such case no such summons as in section 793 is

mentioned shall be necessary, but the accused person may be

forthwith committed to jail or admitted to bail as in the last preceding

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 36

section provided, and all further steps shall be taken in manner herein

provided, as though such summons or summons and warrant as

aforesaid had been issued.

796. On the day appointed by the court for the hearing of the charge,

or on any subsequent day to which the hearing may have been

adjourned in consequence of the previous non-attendance of the

accused person, the court shall commence the hearing by asking the

accused person whether or not he admits the truth of the charge; and

if he does not admit the truth of the charge, the court shall proceed to

take evidence (if any) which may be necessary in addition to the court

minute under section 795 to establish the charge; and also to take the

accused person's statement and any evidence which he may offer in

answer to the charge.

797(1) If the accused person admits the charge, or if after taking the

evidence on both sides and considering the court minute and hearing

the accused person's explanation the court finds the accused person

guilty of the charge, it shall make out a conviction in the form No. 134

in the First Schedule or to the like effect, which shall recite the materials

on which the conviction is founded, and adjudicate upon the material

facts of the accused person's behaviour and language, with so much of

the surrounding circumstances as cause these to constitute the

offences of contempt of court. And the sentence passed by the court

shall be recorded on this conviction.

(2) If the court finds the accused person not guilty of the charge laid, it

shall dismiss the charge, and shall make and record an order to that

effect.

798. An appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal from every order,

sentence, or conviction made by any court in the exercise of its special

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 37

jurisdiction to take cognizance of, and to punish by way of summary

procedure the offence of contempt of court, and of offences by this

Ordinance made punishable as contempt of court; and the procedure

on any such appeal shall follow the procedure laid down in the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act regulating appeals from orders made in the

ordinary criminal jurisdiction of Magistrates Courts.

799. Every sentence of fine or imprisonment passed by a court in

exercise of its special jurisdiction to take cognizance of, and to punish

by way of summary procedure the offence of, contempt of court, and

offences by this Ordinance made punishable as contempt of court, shall

be carried into effect in the same manner and according to the same

procedure as is provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act for

carrying into effect sentences of fine or imprisonment passed by any

court in the exercise of its ordinary criminal jurisdiction.

800. The provisions of Article 105 (3) of the Constitution and sections

18 and 55 of the Judicature Act shall apply to the sentence of fine or

imprisonment, as the case may be, that may be imposed on conviction

for contempt under this Chapter by the various courts.

Accordingly, in terms of section 11, all High Courts, District Courts, Family

Courts, Small Claims Courts, Magistrates Courts, and Primary Courts are

required to follow the procedure set out in Chapter LXV of the Civil

Procedure Code, irrespective of whether the alleged contempt committed is

in facie curiae or ex facie curiae. This includes, for example, acts such as

the intentional insult or interruption of a Judge during the course of judicial

proceedingsan offence identified in section 223 of the Penal Code, read

with section 388 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in relation to the

District Court and Magistrates Court, and section 392 read with section

135(1)(c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in relation to the High Court.

It also extends to the giving of false evidence in the High Court and the other

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 38

courts, as contemplated in sections 448 and 449 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

This represents a departure from the previous legal position, under which

procedural requirements for contempt varied depending on the forum and

the nature of the alleged act. Section 11 now establishes a uniform

procedural regime, thereby enhancing consistency, fairness, and legal

certainty in contempt proceedings across all courts of first instance

including the High Courts.

Section 15 of the Contempt of Court Act of 2024 reinforces this position by

providing that:

The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything

to the contrary contained in any other written law, and accordingly, in

the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Act and

such other law, the provisions of this Act shall prevail.

Section 15 of the Contempt of Court Act of 2024 contains a non obstante

clause, which stipulates that the provisions of the Act shall prevail over any

inconsistent provisions in any other written law. This legislative directive

underscores the intention of Parliament to accord overriding effect to the

procedures, powers, and safeguards set out in the Contempt of Court Act

of 2024, even where such provisions may conflict with those contained in

earlier enactments, such as the Judicature Act or the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

Trial before another Judge

According to section 11(2) of the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or

Institution Act, No. 8 of 2024, the Judge of the court of first instance in

whose presence or hearing the contempt is alleged to have been committed

is required to inquire from the accused whether he wishes to be tried by a

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 39

different Judge, and to take steps accordingly. The provision reads as

follows:

Where the Judge of a Court of First Instance referred to in subsection

(1) acts under section 795 of the Civil Procedure Code, such Judge shall

inquire from the accused whether he wishes to be tried by a Judge

other than the Judge in whose presence or hearing the contempt of

court is alleged to have been committed.

It must, however, be clarified that this requirement applies: (a) at the stage

of inquiry/hearing, and (b) only in cases where the alleged contempt is

committed in facie curiae. Accordingly, the Judge is not required to make

such an inquiry where the contempt is alleged to have been committed ex

facie curiae. I must further observe that the applicability of this provision

cannot be circumvented by resorting to summary punishment, in view of

the uniform procedural framework introduced by the Contempt of Court Act

of 2024, as outlined above.

The purpose and importance of contempt jurisdiction

Contempt committed against, or in disregard of, the authority of court must

be viewed with the utmost seriousness. If courts and their orders are not

respected, the very foundation of the rule of law is placed in jeopardy. The

exercise of contempt jurisdiction is not intended for the glorification of the

court, but rather to safeguard the dignity and authority of the judicial office,

without which public confidence in the administration of justice cannot be

sustained. Public confidence is the cornerstone of any judicial system. Once

eroded, the rule of law crumbles and anarchy takes its place. I must

emphasise that public confidence in the administration of justice is

undermined not only by condoning the unlawful intrusion upon the

authority of court, but also by the misuse of the contempt jurisdiction by

Judges for the enhancement of their personal stature.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 40

The traditional distinction between civil contempt and criminal contempt,

often drawn on the basis of whether the act was committed in facie curiae

(in the face of the court) or ex facie curiae (out of court), has become

increasingly blurred over time and no longer occupies a central place in

modern contempt jurisprudence.

In Kandoluwe Sumangala v. Mapitigama Dharmarakitta (1908) 11 NLR 195

at 201, Justice Wood Renton (as His Lordship then was) stated:

It is extremely difficult to bring home to the minds of some people, and

yet it is of vital moment that everyone should know, that the law of

contempt of Court does not exist for the glorification of the Bench. It

existsand exists solelyfor the protection of the public.

The oft-quoted statement of Lord Morris in Attorney-General v. Times

Newspapers Limited [1974] AC 273 at 302, succinctly captures the

fundamental rationale of the contempt jurisdiction vested in courts:

[T]he phrase contempt of court is one which is compendious to include

not only disobedience to orders of a court but also certain types of

behaviour or varieties of publications in reference to proceedings before

courts of law which overstep the bounds which liberty permits. In an

ordered community courts are established for the pacific settlement of

disputes and for the maintenance of law and order. In the general

interests of the community it is imperative that the authority of the

Courts should not be imperilled and that recourse to them should not

be subject to unjustifiable interference. When such unjustifiable

interference is suppressed it is not because those charged with the

responsibilities of administering justice are concerned for their own

dignity: it is because the very structure of the ordered life is at risk if

the recognised courts of the land are so flouted and their authority

wanes and is supplanted.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 41

It is sometimes overlooked that contempt is an offence committed against

the court itself, and not against any individual party. The confusion

frequently arises, as in the present case, when a party invokes the contempt

jurisdiction, in effect, on behalf of the court. In this context, it must be

emphasised that there should be no room for overly technical objections in

contempt proceedings, although, regrettably, prevailing practice tends to

suggest otherwise.

The fact that, in proceedings for contempt of court, the matter lies between

the court and the alleged contemnor was underscored by the Supreme

Court of India in D.N. Taneja v. Bhajan Lal [1988] 3 S.C.R. 888 at 894, in

the following terms:

A contempt is a matter between the court and the alleged contemnor.

Any person who moves the machinery of the court for contempt only

brings to the notice of the court certain facts constituting contempt of

court. After furnishing such information he may still assist the court,

but it must always be borne in mind that in a contempt proceeding

there are only two parties, namely, the court and the contemnor.

In Om Prakash Jaiswal v. D.K. Mittal & Another AIR 2000 SC 1136 at 1140-

1141, the Supreme Court of India stated as follows:

A private party or a litigant may also invite the attention of the Court to

such facts as may persuade the Court in initiating proceedings for

contempt. However, such person filing an application or petition before

the Court does not become a complainant or petitioner in the

proceedings. He is just an informer or relator. His duty ends with the

facts being brought to the notice of the Court. It is thereafter for the

Court to act on such information or not to act though the private party

or litigant moving the Court may at the discretion of the Court continue

to render its assistance during the course of proceedings.

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 42

However, as emphasised earlier, the exercise of contempt jurisdiction must

always be guided by the principles of fairness, necessity, and

proportionality, and should never be invoked lightly.

In Re Garumunige Tilakaratne [1999] 1 Sri LR 134 at 149, Justice

Amerasinghe remarked:

Because the offence of contempt is amorphous and has no determinate

shape or structure and is virtually unrestrained in the will of the Court,

the jurisdiction to punish for contempt given by Article 105(3) of the

Constitution ought to be jealously and carefully watched and

cautiously exercised with the greatest reluctance and the greatest

anxiety.

It is a power to be exercised not as the first resort, but as the last resort.

Consistent with this approach, the issuance of summons ex parte under

section 793 of the Civil Procedure Code should not be done as a matter of

routine. Before issuing such summons, the court must make a considered

assessment of the material placed before it to determine, on a prima facie

basis, whether sufficient grounds exist to justify requiring the accused to

answer the charge. However, at that stage, the court is not required to

examine the application in detail or determine the substantive matter on its

merits. (Media Image Ltd v. Dissanayake [2006] 3 Sri LR 215)

Section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act of 2024 sets out the procedure by

which the Court of Appeal may assume jurisdiction over contempt of court

committed against a court of first instance. However, even the Court of

Appeal is not empowered to issue process merely upon the invocation of its

jurisdiction. In terms of section 10(3), the Court of Appeal must first peruse

the reference, motion, or affidavit filed under subsection (1) and satisfy itself

that a prima facie case of contempt has been established against the person

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 43

alleged to have committed such contempt before causing a rule to be issued.

Section 10(3) reads as follows:

The Court of Appeal shall, after perusing the reference made or the

motion or affidavit filed under subsection (1), as the case may be, and

satisfying itself that a prima facie case of contempt of a court, tribunal

or institution, as the case may be, has been established against the

person alleged to have committed such contempt, cause a rule to be

issued on such person.

Any misuse of contempt powers for the personal glorification of the Judge

constitutes a grave abuse of judicial authority, which must be unequivocally

condemned and addressed by the appropriate disciplinary authorities, as

such conduct often causes irreparable and irretrievable harm on the

integrity of the whole justice system.

Conclusion

I am unable to accept the argument that section 18 of the Judicature Act

applies only where a High Court established under Article 154P of the

Constitution exercises criminal jurisdiction under the provisions of the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990. Such an

artificial distinction not only contradicts the language of the statute but also

runs counter to well-established canons of statutory interpretation and

common sense.

I hold that section 18 of the Judicature Act applies to offences of contempt

committed against, or in disrespect of, the authority of any High Court,

including the High Court established under Article 154P of the Constitution,

whether such contempt is committed in facie curiae or ex facie curiae.

In addition, under Article 105(3) of the Constitution, the Court of Appeal

has concurrent jurisdiction to punish for contempt of any court of first

SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018 44

instance, including the High Court. Similar provisions have been introduced

in section 6(3) of the Contempt of Court Act of 2024, which enacts as

follows:

6(3) The Court of Appeal shall have the power to punish for contempt

of a Court of First Instance or tribunal or institution, whether committed

in its presence or hearing or elsewhere:

Provided however, the provisions of this section shall not prejudice or

affect the rights of a Court of First Instance to punish for contempt of

itself.

When a party opts to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal instead

of the High Court and is found guilty of contempt, as provided for in Article

105(3), the Court of Appeal may punish the accused with imprisonment or

fine or both as the court may deem fit. Unlike the High Court, there are no

prescribed upper limits for the imprisonment or fine that the Court of

Appeal may impose. However, such punishment must always be

commensurate with the gravity of the contempt.

I answer the question of law on which leave to appeal was granted in the

affirmative and dismiss the appeal with costs.

The High Court is directed to conclude the contempt inquiry and main

inquiry as expeditiously as possible.
