"Background"
"The  original  petitioner  instituted  this  action  in  the  High  Court  of  the"
"Western Province holden in Colombo in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction"
"(conveniently  known 
as 
“Commercial  High  Court 
in  Colombo”) 
on"
"13.10.2014 
against 
five 
respondents 
seeking 
substantive 
reliefs 
on"
"oppression 
(section  224  of 
the  Companies  Act,  No.  7  of  2007)  and"
"mismanagement of the affairs of the 1st respondent company (section 225"
"of  the  same  Act).  Pending  determination  of  the  substantive  reliefs,  the"
"petitioner sought several interim reliefs."
"After  inquiry,  the  High  Court  by  its  order  dated  22.04.2015  issued  an"
"interim  order  against  the  1st  to  4th  respondents  “restraining  them  from"
"preventing  the  petitioner  from  acting  as  a  director  of  the  1st  respondent"
"company  as  prayed  for  in  paragraph  (l)  of  the  prayer  to  the  petition  upon"
"depositing a sum of Rs. 500,000 as security.” The petitioner complained to"
"the  High  Court  by  petition  and  affidavit  dated  07.07.2015  together  with"
"summons,  charge  sheet  and  annexures  that  the  1st  and  2nd  respondents"
"violated  the  said  interim  order  and  therefore  they  shall  be  punished  for"
"contempt of court."
"Upon service of process, the 1st respondent moved to have the application"
"dismissed in limine, contending that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to"
"entertain the matter, as the alleged contempt was ex facie curiae (committed"
"out  of  court)  and  the  Companies  Act  contains  no  provision  conferring"
"jurisdiction 
to  punish 
for  such  contempt. 
In  essence, 
the  argument"
"advanced by the 1st respondent was that the contempt jurisdiction of the"
"Commercial High Court is limited to contempts committed in facie curiae (in"
"the face of the court), and does not extend to contempts committed out of"
