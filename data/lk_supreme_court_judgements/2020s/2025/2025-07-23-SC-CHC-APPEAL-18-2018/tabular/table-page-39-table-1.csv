"other  than  the  Judge  in  whose  presence  or  hearing  the  contempt  of"
"court is alleged to have been committed."
"It must, however, be clarified that this requirement applies: (a) at the stage"
"of  inquiry/hearing,  and  (b)  only  in  cases  where  the  alleged  contempt  is"
"committed in facie curiae. Accordingly, the Judge is not required to make"
"such an inquiry where the contempt is alleged to have been committed ex"
"facie curiae. I must further observe that the applicability of this provision"
"cannot be circumvented by resorting to summary punishment, in  view of"
"the uniform procedural framework introduced by the Contempt of Court Act"
