"S
everal statutes recognise specific acts and omissions as being punishable"
"“as  contempt  of  court”.  For 
instance,  several  provisions  of 
the  Civil"
"Procedure  Code 
expressly 
identify 
certain 
acts 
and 
omissions 
as"
"constituting offences of contempt. These include sections 103(4), 103(12),"
"109(2), 137(2), 140, 183B, 295, 330, 358, 372, 663, 713(3), 717(1), 718(3),"
"and 724A(3). Reference may also be made to Chapter X of the Penal Code,"
"titled  “Of  Contempts  of  the  Lawful  Authority  of  Public  Servants”,  which"
"comprises sections 170 to 187 and sets out a series of offences that may, in"
"appropriate cases, amount to contempt of court. In terms of section 19 of"
"the Penal Code, the term “public servant” includes every judge. As another"
"example, section 53 of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, confers contempt"
"jurisdiction on the District Court in the context of partition actions."
"Before the enactment of such statutory provisions, the subject of contempt"
"of  court  was  largely  governed  by  English  common  law  principles.  The"
"complexity of the law has been compounded by the differing interpretations"
"given  by  the  courts  to  the  relevant  statutory  provisions,  and 
further"
"complicated  by  the  varying  ways  in  which  those  judicial  dicta  have  been"
"understood  and  applied  by  members  of  the  legal  profession.  With  the"
"enactment of the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act, No. 8 of"
"2024  (hereinafter  sometimes  “Contempt  of  Court  Act  of  2024”),  the  law"
"governing contempt of court has now been consolidated and streamlined,"
"thereby bringing greater clarity, consistency and coherence to this area of"
"the  law.  This  does  not  mean  that  there  is  no  room  or  need  for  further"
"improvement."
"However, there remain numerous pending cases that must be addressed in"
"accordance with the law as it stood prior to the passage of the Contempt of"
"Court Act of 2024. Accordingly, it is not a futile exercise to set out the law"
"as it existed prior to the enactment of the Act, as it remains pertinent to the"
"resolution of the pending matters, including the instant appeal."
