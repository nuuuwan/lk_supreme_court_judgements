"The Reception and Growth of Contempt Jurisdiction in the Law of Sri Lanka,"
"[2008] Vol. XIV, Part I, BASL Law Journal, page 1, expresses the view that:"
"The power of punishment for contempt thus conferred on the Provincial"
"High Court in my view is no different to the similar powers conferred"
"on all Inferior Courts of Record established under the previous regimes,"
"as opposed to the powers of contempt recognized in respect of Superior"
"Courts of Record."
