"(4) Can  the  Plaintiff-Appellant-Petitioner  raise  the  validity  of  the 
impugned  deed"
"marked (P6) on the ground that of due execution at this stage of the case?"
"Question of Law No. 4"
"Question of Law No. 1 is whether Deed No. 7216 (P6) was duly executed. Question of Law"
"No. 4 challenges the ability of the Appellant to raise this question at this stage. Question"
"of Law No. 1 will not arise for consideration should Question of Law No. 4 be answered in"
"the negative. Hence, I will first examine Question of Law No. 4."
"The Respondent submits that the issue of due execution of Deed No. 7216 (P6) was never"
"part of the case of the Appellant. The cause of action pleaded by the Appellant was that"
"Deed No. 7216 (P6) is a forgery. No issue was raised on the due execution of that deed. It"
"was submitted that the facts and circumstances of Thiyagarasa (supra) are different as"
"due execution was put in issue there."
"The Appellant contends that his signature was obtained fraudulently to Deed No. 7216"
"(P6), which is an absolute transfer, after misleading him that it was a conditional transfer."
"He claims that he cannot read Sinhala. Moreover, it is submitted that Deed No. 7216 (P6)"
"was  signed  by  the  parties  at  different  places.  The  Appellant  contends  that 
in  the"
"circumstances of the case, the burden of proving due execution was on the Respondent."
