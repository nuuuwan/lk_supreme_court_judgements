"This  matter  pertains  to  a  petition  filed  by  one  Sriramachandran  Thanikumar,"
"Attorney-at-Law, on behalf of  his client,  Kumarasamy Manoharan,  hereinafter"
"referred to as ‘the detainee’, a German national of Sri Lankan origin, who had"
"been  detained  at  the  Tangalle  Old  Prison 
in  the  custody  of  the  Terrorist"
"Investigation Division (TID)."
"The petitioner had prayed for a declaration of a violation of the abovementioned"
"detainee’s fundamental rights under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and (2) under the"
"Constitution along with compensation of Rs. 50 million."
"When  this  matter  had  been  supported  before  this  Court  for  leave,  Court  has"
"granted  leave  under  Articles  12(1),  13(1)  and  13(2)  under  the  Constitution  on"
"01.02.2022."
"The  petitioner  had  stated  that  the  detainee 
is  a  German  national,  having"
"migrated in 1982, had been working as a care giver in a German elder’s home."
"He  had 
frequently  visited  Sri  Lanka  to  see  his 
family  and  support  poor"

"The respondents have alleged that that financial support was for the funding of"
"terrorist activities in the north and the east of Sri Lanka, which the petitioner"
"vehemently denies."
"The  petitioner  alleges  that  the  detainee  was  unlawfully  arrested  on  or  about"

"a reason had not been provided for his arrest."
"Following the detainee’s arrest, he was transferred to the TID headquarters and"
"eventually to the Tangalle prison, without proper legal procedure being followed"
"and crucially without the proper issuance of a detention order."

"access  to  his  client,  the  detainee,  while  in  custody,  such  access  had  been"
"repeatedly denied or severely restricted."
"He further claims that the detainee had been physically assaulted, deprived of"
"basic  needs, 
forced 
to  confess  and  placed 
in  solitary  confinement  under"
