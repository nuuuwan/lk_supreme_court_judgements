"In Gnanapandithan Vs. Balanayagam (1998) 1 SRL 391, it was held;"
"“The  question  whether  delay 
is 
fatal 
to  an  application 
in  revision"
"depends  of  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case,  having  regard  to"
"the very special and exceptional circumstances of the case.”"
"In the case of Perera Vs. People’s Bank (Bar Journal 1995 Vol. IV Part 1"
"Page 12), it was observed that;"
"“Revision is a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the petitioner is"
"intensely relevant to the granting of such relief.”"
"It  is  very  much  apparent  from  the  petition  filed  before  the  High  Court  that"
"the petitioner-appellants have filed the revision application, which led to the"
"judgment  of  the  High  Court  primarily  on  the  basis  that  the  1st  petitioner-"
"appellant was misled by the plaintiff of the partition action for him to believe"
"that the partition action was only in relation to 18 acres of land and not for"
"36 acres, as the balance 18 acres had already being conveyed by the father"
"of the plaintiff of the action to the father of the 1st appellant-petitioner."
"This appears to be the reason provided by the petitioner-appellants for their"
"non-participation  in  the  partition  action  and  also  to  justify  that  they  have"
"exceptional grounds to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court."
"In 
the  petition 
filed  before 
the  High  Court 
itself, 
the  appellants  have"
"admitted  that  the  1st  petitioner-appellant  became  aware  of  the  partition"
"action  in  December  2005.  The  plaint  in  this  partition  action  has  been  filed"
"on  15-05-2005  and 
the  preliminary  survey  has  been  carried  out 
in"
"December  2005.  Admittedly,  the  appellants  had  known  about  the  partition"
"action at least from the time of the preliminary survey."
"However,  as  correctly  observed  by  the  learned  Judges  of  the  High  Court,"
"after affixing notice as to the institution of the partition action at the Grama"
"Sewaka  Office  as  required  under 
the  Partition  Law, 
the  1st  petitioner-"
"appellant  who  has  claimed  title  to  half  of  the  land,  which  was  the  subject"
"matter of the action, has become aware of the partition action from its very"
"inception. The affidavit marked and produced as R-01 of the relevant Grama"
