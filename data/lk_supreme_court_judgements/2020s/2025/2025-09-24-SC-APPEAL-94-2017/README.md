Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the petitioner-appellants (hereinafter referred

to as the petitioner-appellants) on the basis of being aggrieved by the

judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court of the Central Province

holden in Kandy while exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction (hereinafter

referred to as the High Court) in the Revision Application No.

CP/HCCA/21/2019 (REV). The said judgment has been pronounced on 27-

01-2015, and for the reasons set out in the judgment, the learned Judges of

the High Court have dismissed the said revision application.

Page 5 of 17

When this matter was supported for the granting of Leave to Appeal on 16-

05-2017, this Court granted Leave to Appeal on the questions of law as set

out in sub-paragraphs (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (x) of paragraph 15 of the

petition dated 27-02-2015.

In addition to the above, two additional questions of law as proposed by the

learned President’s Counsel who represented the defendant-defendant-

respondents (hereinafter referred to as the respondents) has also been

permitted.

The said questions of law that need consideration in this appeal read as

follows;

1. Did the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judges err by not

exercising revisionary jurisdiction conferred on the Civil Appellate

High Court in order to avoid miscarriage of justice caused to the

petitioners in the circumstances of this case.

2. Did the learned Judges of the High Court err in law in construing

the contents of terms of settlement (X1) and the settlement order

(X3) and by concluding that they were not identical.

3. Did the learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court err by not

appreciating that the subsequent publication of the settlement

order in the government gazette is only a confirmation of title

already vested in the predecessor of the petitioners by X1.

4. Did the Civil Appellate High Court err in holding that the land

sought to be partitioned was different from the land claimed by the

petitioners, without taking into account that the land described in

X1 and X2 has been referred to in P3 and P4 relied upon by the

respondents and also in the settlement order published in gazette

(X3) by reference to and identical lot 32 in B.S.V.P. 331.

5. Whether the provisions of section 8 of the Land Settlement

Ordinance have to be construed in the light of the entry of

settlement on 16-05-1956 and the publication of order (X3) after

27 years so as not to prejudice of the rights of a purchaser after the

settlement.

Page 6 of 17

6. Does the publication of land settlement order in gazette X3 vitiates

any deeds executed prior to that date.

7. Whether the document marked X1 has any legal validity after the

land settlement order in gazette notification marked X3.

At the hearing of this appeal, this Court heard the submissions of the

learned Counsel who represented the petitioner-appellants and also the

submissions of the learned President’s Counsel who represented the

respondents. This Court also had the benefit of considering the extensive

written submissions tendered by the parties as to their respective stands.

The facts that led to the filing of the revision application before the

Provincial High Court can be summarized in the following manner.

The plaintiff in District Court of Matale Partition Action No. P2508 has

instituted proceedings in order to partition the land morefully described in

the schedule of the plaint between the plaintiff and the defendants named in

the action.

After following the due procedure in that regard, the Commissioner

appointed for the purposes of the action, namely, Licensed Surveyor

W.M.G.P. Gunathilaka, has prepared the preliminary survey plan No. 1795

dated 15-12-2005, identifying the land sought to be partitioned as lot 1 to 4

of the said plan.

According to the preliminary survey report, no one has claimed rights to the

land other than the parties to the action.

At the trial, there had been no dispute as to the corpus sought to be

partitioned and the title pleaded.

This is a land where the mentioned original owner Lokubanda Thoradeniya

has become entitled through a Land Settlement Certificate issued by the

Commissioner of Land Settlements, and published in the Extra-Ordinary

Gazette No. 253/15 dated 15-07-1983.

Page 7 of 17

Since there had been no contest as to the corpus and to the entitlements of

the parties, the learned District Judge of Matale, having considered the

evidence led before him, has pronounced his judgment dated 25-07-2007,

allowing the partitioning of the corpus sought to be partitioned among the

parties as stated in the judgment.

The interlocutory decree has been entered on 25-07-2007. After having

considered the final partition plan and the report No. 2427 dated 3rd and 4th

of January 2008, the said plan has been confirmed and the final decree has

been entered on 27-02-2009, and accordingly, the partition action has been

concluded.

By the petition dated 23-07-2009, the petitioner-appellants have filed the

earlier mentioned revision application before the High Court, seeking to set

aside the interlocutory and the final decrees and all the proceedings of the

District Court of Matale Case No. P2508, and thereby, seeking a direction to

the District Court to confine the said partition case after the exclusion of 18

acres from the corpus as claimed by the petitioner-appellants, and for other

incidental reliefs.

It had been the position of the petitioner-appellants that the original owner

of the corpus that was partitioned, namely, Lokubanda Thoradeniya, was

the brother of the father of the 1st petitioner appellant, and he became

entitled to the said corpus containing 36 acres as a result of a land

settlement as stated in the partition action. However, the petitioner-

appellants have claimed that the said Lokubanda Thoradeniya by the deed

of transfer No. 18929 dated 25-11-1971, conveyed a half share of the said

allotment to the father of the 1st appellant-petitioner, namely, Ciril Bandara

Thoradeniya. It has been claimed that accordingly, the said allotment of

land was possessed and cultivated by both the brothers, and the Settlement

Officer, after the finalization of all claims under notice number 3068,

proceeded to publish the Settlement Order under section 5(5) of the

Ordinance in the Government Gazette No. 253/15 dated 15-07-1983 (the

document marked X-3).

Page 8 of 17

It has been claimed that in terms of the Settlement Order, the said

Lokubanda was finally allocated an extent of 36 acres, 01 rood and 20

perches depicted as subdivided lot No. 308 in lot No. 32, which in turn

assigned title plan No. S-50234.

The petitioner-appellants who were the petitioners before the High Court

have averred that the brother of Lokubanda, who became the owner of half

share of the land through the earlier mentioned deed, transferred his

undivided rights to the 1st petitioner-appellant, and he, in turn made several

transfers of the said half share as pleaded in the petition and they held and

possessed the said allotment of land.

It has been stated that the 1st petitioner-appellant who is residing on a land

to the West of the subject matter became aware of the partition action

instituted by the plaintiff-respondent only on or about 15th and 16th of

December 2005. It has been further stated that when he inquired from the

plaintiff about the partition action, he was informed that the partition action

was only in regard to the half share of his father, meaning the original owner

Lokubanda, and hence, he had no reason to intervene in the case.

It has been the position taken before the High Court that the plaintiffs and

the defendants in the partition action, by acting collusively and

fraudulently, has instituted the partition action knowing the petitioner-

appellants’ rights very well and had obtained the partition decree, which has

resulted in a miscarriage of justice and a manifest gross abuse of the

process of Court.

It has been averred that the grounds set out in paragraph 21, 22, 23, 28,

30, 31 and 32 of the petition disclose exceptional circumstances warranting

the exercise of the exclusive revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court.

The High Court, after having considered the contents of the petition before

it, has decided to issue notice to the respondents mentioned, and after

hearing all parties and allowing parties to file written submissions as well,

has pronounced the impugned judgment.

Page 9 of 17

Having considered the above factual matrix, it needs to be noted at the very

outset of this judgment that this appeal relates to an application filed before

the High Court invoking the discretionary remedy of revision, which could

be granted only under exceptional circumstances.

In the case of Thilagaratnam Vs. Edirisinghe (1982) 1 SLR 56, it was

observed that;

“Though the Appellate Court’s powers to act in revision were wide and

be exercised whether an appeal has been taken against the order of the

original Court or not such powers could be exercised only in exceptional

circumstances.”

In the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Mercantile Hotels Management

Ltd (1987) 1 SLR 5, it was stated that;

“It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the

appellate Courts is confined to cases in which exceptional

circumstances exist warranting its intervention.”

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Tharmaratnam (Sriskantha Law Report

Volume iv page 47), it was held;

“Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the

Court.”

It is quite apparent from the High Court judgment that, the learned Judges

of the High Court were very much mindful as to the manner a revision

application filed before the Court should be considered and determined. The

learned High Court Judges were highly observant that in such a situation,

the conduct of the parties and whether there was an inordinate delay in

coming before the Court will also be intensely relevant when it comes to the

consideration of facts and the law placed before the Court.

Page 10 of 17

In Gnanapandithan Vs. Balanayagam (1998) 1 SRL 391, it was held;

“The question whether delay is fatal to an application in revision

depends of the facts and circumstances of the case, having regard to

the very special and exceptional circumstances of the case.”

In the case of Perera Vs. People’s Bank (Bar Journal 1995 Vol. IV Part 1

Page 12), it was observed that;

“Revision is a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the petitioner is

intensely relevant to the granting of such relief.”

It is very much apparent from the petition filed before the High Court that

the petitioner-appellants have filed the revision application, which led to the

judgment of the High Court primarily on the basis that the 1st petitioner-

appellant was misled by the plaintiff of the partition action for him to believe

that the partition action was only in relation to 18 acres of land and not for

36 acres, as the balance 18 acres had already being conveyed by the father

of the plaintiff of the action to the father of the 1st appellant-petitioner.

This appears to be the reason provided by the petitioner-appellants for their

non-participation in the partition action and also to justify that they have

exceptional grounds to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court.

In the petition filed before the High Court itself, the appellants have

admitted that the 1st petitioner-appellant became aware of the partition

action in December 2005. The plaint in this partition action has been filed

on 15-05-2005 and the preliminary survey has been carried out in

December 2005. Admittedly, the appellants had known about the partition

action at least from the time of the preliminary survey.

However, as correctly observed by the learned Judges of the High Court,

after affixing notice as to the institution of the partition action at the Grama

Sewaka Office as required under the Partition Law, the 1st petitioner-

appellant who has claimed title to half of the land, which was the subject

matter of the action, has become aware of the partition action from its very

inception. The affidavit marked and produced as R-01 of the relevant Grama

Page 11 of 17

Sewaka in that regard clearly establishes the said fact. The 1st petitioner-

appellant should have known that the partition action was not for a land of

18 acres as he thought, but for the entire land of 36 acres when he saw and

read the notice affixed at the office of the Grama Sewaka.

Even if he was misled by the plaintiff in the partition action for him to

believe that the partition action was only in relation to the half share owned

by the plaintiff’s father Lokubanda, which amounts to an extent of around

18 acres, he should have very well come to know that it was not so when the

Commissioner surveyed the entire land of 36 acres for the purpose of the

partition action. The 1st petitioner-appellant is admittedly a person living on

a land situated to the West of the subject matter, and if the 1st petitioner-

appellant and other appellants were in possession of the 18 acres as claimed

by them, there was no reason for them to understand that their rights would

be affected.

Having considered the time it would take for a surveyor to survey a land of

36 acres, it is impossible to believe that the 1st petitioner-appellant could

not have realized that it included the 18 acres of land claimed by him and

other appellants, which they owned and possessed according to them.

The averments in the petition before the High Court, as well as the

document submitted to the Court, establish that the petitioner-appellants

were well aware of the partition action proceedings, the survey conducted for

the preparation of the preliminary and final partition plan, and also entering

of the interlocutory decree as well as the final decree of the partition action.

The final decree of the action has been entered on 27-02-2009, whereby the

corpus to be partitioned which comprised of 36 acres, 1 rood and 20

perches has been divided among the plaintiff and the 4 defendants of the

partition action. This means that the entire land including the 18 acres

claimed by the appellants had been divided in accordance with the final

decree, and the relevant parties may have taken possession of their divided

portions of land. This also means the petitioner- appellants losing

Page 12 of 17

possession of 18 acres of land, if they had previous possession of the same,

as a result of the said final partition decree.

Under the circumstances, I am of the view that the learned Judges of the

High Court were correct in considering the conduct of the petitioners as

intensely relevant in deciding the revision application. I find that although

the final decree has been entered in February 2009, the petitioner-

appellants have gone before the High Court on 23-07-2009, around 5

months after the entering of the final decree.

It is settled law that delay in seeking a discretionary remedy is also a matter

a Court would consider relevant, although the length of the delay needs to

be considered depending on the facts and the circumstances unique to each

case. I am of the view that a delay of around 5 months has to be considered

as relevant, in view of their failure to explain such a delay before the High

Court.

The facts as stated above show that the petitioner-appellants have failed to

show any due diligence in asserting their rights knowing very well of the

existence of the partition action if they believed that their rights were to be

disturbed as they claim. I find that this aspect has also been duly

considered by the learned Judges of the High Court.

The case of Perera and Others Vs. Adline and Others (2000) 3 SLR 93

was a case where a similar situation was considered by the Court of Appeal.

Upholding a preliminary objection raised as to the maintainability of a

revision application challenging the interlocutory decree, it was determined

that based on the facts and the circumstances, the petitioners in that case

have accepted the finality of the judgment and the interlocutory decree. It

was determined that hence, the petitioners are estopped from denying the

validity of the interlocutory decree.

Per Jayawickrema, J.,

“Although in an appropriate case this court has jurisdiction to act

in revision and restitutio – integrum, but where a party has

deliberately not shown due diligence even after he was notified

Page 13 of 17

by the surveyor to appear in court and fails to apply to be added

as a party this court will not exercise its jurisdiction in his

favour…”

I find that the learned Judges of the High Court have not proceeded to

dismiss the revision application only on above considerations, but have

proceeded to consider the application on its merit, in order to come to a

finding whether there are any other exceptional circumstances that warrant

the intervention of the Court.

Towards the said objective, the High Court has considered whether the

appellants have a right to claim title to the property as they claim.

The document marked X-01 is the land settlement notice issued under the

provisions of the Land Settlement Ordinance in favour of Lokubanda

Thoradeniya, who is the admitted original owner of the corpus to be

partitioned. The land settlement notice, which has settled the land in favour

of Lokubanda Thoradeniya, had a condition that the person in whose favour

the land was settled must pay a particular sum before a certain date.

As correctly observed by the learned Judges of the High Court, that means

the said notice marked X-01 does not confer absolute title of the property in

favour of Lokubanda, for him to transfer half share of the property to his

brother under whom the petitioner-appellants have come before the High

Court to claim title. They have claimed title based on the deed marked X-02,

namely, deed No. 18929 dated 25-11-1971. In the said deed, the said

Lokubanda traces his title to a land settlement notice No. 3060 dated 27-10-

1964, to an extent of 36 acres. However, the document marked X-01 is a

land settlement notice issued in favour of Lokubanda Thoradeniya on 16-

05-1956, which cannot be presumed in the absence of specific explanation

as to the said discrepancy and that it relates to one and the same land.

Accordingly, I find no reason to disagree with the conclusion of the learned

Judges of the High Court that the document marked X-03 is not identical to

the document marked X-01.

Page 14 of 17

The effect of a final land settlement order made and duly published in the

Government Gazette has been set out in section 8 of the Land Settlement

Ordinance, which reads thus;

8. Subject to the provisions of section 5(6), every settlement

order shall be published in the Gazette, and every settlement

order so published shall be judicially noticed and shall be

conclusive proof, so far as the State or any person is thereby

declared to be entitled to any land or to any share of or

interest in any land, that the State or such person is entitled

to such land or to such share of or interest in the land or to

such share of or interest in the land free of all encumbrances

whatsoever other than those specified in such order and that

subject to the encumbrance specified in such order such land

or share or interest vests absolutely in the State or in such

person to the exclusion of all unspecified interests of

whatsoever nature and, so far as it is thereby declared that any

land is not claimed by the State or that some person

unascertained is entitled to a particular share of or interest in

any land, that the State has no title to such land or that some

person unascertained is entitled to such share of the land or

that such interest in the land exists and that some person

unascertained is entitled thereto, as the case maybe:

Provided that nothing in this section contained shall affect the

right of any person prejudiced by fraud or the willful

suppression of facts of any claimant under the notice from

proceedings against such claimant either for the recovery of

damages or for the recovery of the land awarded to such

claimant by the order.

Page 15 of 17

The validity of a right obtained by a person from another before the said

person was declared entitled to the property by a final land settlement order

was considered in the case of Periacaruppen Chettiar Vs. Messers.

Properties and Agents Ltd 47 NLR 121.

G, by deed 3D4 of 21st December 1928 sold to the first defendant

company a land the titles of which he expected to obtain subsequently

by virtue of a settlement under the Ordinance relating to claims to

forests, chena, waste, and unoccupied lands.

By an order made on 27th October 1933, under section 8 of the Land

Settlement Ordinance (Cap.319), G was declared entitled to the

property.

Plaintiff became the successor in title to G on 11th April 1938 by bona

fide purchase for value.

Held:

The plea of exceptio rei venditae et traditae was not available to

the first defendant as against the plaintiff and that the

settlement order made in favour of G did not ensure to the

benefit of the first defendant.

The case of A.M. Karunadasa Vs. Abdul Hameed 60 NLR 352 was a case

where the same issue was considered.

Per Sanaoni, J.,

“The land in dispute in this action is two roods in extent. It was the

subject of a settlement order dated 11th November 1939, made under

the Land Settlement Ordinance. That order was published in the

Gazette of 19th July 1940, and by virtue of section 8 of the Ordinance it

became conclusive proof of the title of the persons in whose favour it

was made…

I am unable to agree with the learned Judge when he says that the

benefit of the settlement order in favour of Ausadanaide to the extent of

Page 16 of 17

the land can be claimed by the first defendant, for it has been held that

a plea of exceptio rei venditae is not available to a purchaser as against

a vendor who obtained a settlement order after the purchase was

made- See Periacaruppen Chettiar Vs. Messers. Properties and Agents

Ltd. (1946) 47 NLR 121. The first defendant therefore has no title

whatsoever to the land in dispute.”

Having considered the above settled law, I am of the view that the deed X-02

under which the petitioner-appellants have claimed title to the subject

matter of the partition action, even if it was a deed relating to the same

corpus, has no force or avail in law as rightly determined by the learned

Judges of the High Court.

The learned Judges of the High Court have observed that even the deeds

executed subsequent to the final land settlement order and its publication in

the Gazette X-03 by the 1st petitioner-appellant have not referred to the

relevant order published in the Gazette, whereas it should have been. On

the contrary, all the deeds relied upon by the plaintiffs and the defendants

in the partition action have been executed after the publication of X-03,

where all the said deeds correctly refer to the Gazette Notification as the

source of title, which is a matter that should be considered relevant in an

application in revision.

Moreover, the fact that whether there was a duty cast upon the plaintiff of

the partition action to make the petitioner-appellants parties to the action

had also been drawn the attention of the learned Judges of the High Court.

It has been observed that the land sought to be partitioned is different from

the land claimed by the petitioner-appellants, by name, extent, and the folio

in which they are registered. It has been observed that the deed relied upon

by the petitioner-appellants (X-02) refers to a land called Debaragala Yaya,

registered in folio B.221/73 and the land sought to be partitioned by the

plaintiff of the partition action is a land called Milagalayaya alias

Millagalayaya, registered in a separate folio D.289/8. Therefore, the plaintiff

of the partition action had no duty to make the appellants parties unless the

petitioner-appellants on their own wanted to do so. It has also been

Page 17 of 17

determined that the petitioner-appellants have no basis to claim prescriptive

title as well.

I find that the above observations and determinations are matters that need

consideration when an application for the exercise of the discretionary

remedy of revision is before a competent Court, of which I find no reasons to

disturb.

It appears that the petitioner-appellants have made an attempt to qualify

themselves under the proviso of section 8 of the Land Settlement Ordinance

by claiming fraud on the part of the plaintiff of the partition action on the

basis that it discloses exceptional circumstances. However, I find no such

fraud as claimed that has occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

For the reasons as considered above, I answer the questions of law No. 1 to

5 in the negative, while answering the question of law No. 6 in the

affirmative.

I answer the question of law No. 7 that the final land settlement order

published in the Gazette X-03 shall prevail over the document X-01.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, as I find no merit in the appeal.

There will be no costs of the appeal.
