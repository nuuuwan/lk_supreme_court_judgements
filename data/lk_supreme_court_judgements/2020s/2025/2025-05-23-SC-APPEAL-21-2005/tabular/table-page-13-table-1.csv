"SC. Appeal No. 21/2005"
"As this appeal is against the said Judgment of the Court of Appeal, now this Court will look"
"into the certain observations and findings of the Court of Appeal that goes to the root of its"
"final conclusion over the Judgment of the learned Additional District Judge, as discussed"
"below, to see whether the Court of Appeal erred in the said Judgment dated 20.01.2004."
"The learned Court of Appeal judges observed that it is also the position of the Defendant-"
"Appellant  that  the  land  so  vested  was  described  in  the  aforesaid  Plan  No.913.  Since  the"
"evidence  led  at  the  trial  indicates  that  the  Defendant-Appellant  has  not  challenged  the"
"correctness of this plan and it also appears that it was used in preparing the plan marked V3"
"by the Defendant-Appellant, this observation of the Court of Appeal is correct. Further, it is"
"the position of the Plaintiff-Respondent in his amended Plaint that this Plan No.913 indicates"
"the subdivision made to Lot A in the Plan No. 408B referred to in the Plaint (Vide paragraph"
"5 and 2nd schedule of the plaint) which belonged to Chettinad Ltd., as part of the original"
"extent of 5 Acres and 26.8 Perches that also belonged to Chettinad Ltd. It can be observed"
"that the outer boundaries of the Plan No.913 which has to be the same as the boundaries of"
"Lot A in Plan No. 408B referred to in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint tally with boundaries"
"of the land contemplated in the vesting order. Hence, there cannot be any dispute as to the"
"land vested in the Defendant-Appellant by the vesting order as the one shown in Plan No.913"
"as lots A1, A2 and A3."
"However,  it  must  be  noted  that  the  action  was  filed  by  the  Plaintiff-Respondent  to  get  a"
"declaration that it is entitled to the land described in the 4th schedule to the Plaint and to evict"
"the Defendant-Appellant from the said land. In fact, this action is in essence a rei vindicatio"
"action as there is no contractual relationship between the parties as to the land in dispute"
"such as lease or license. Whether it is a rei vindicatio action or not, for the success of the"
"case of the Plaintiff-Respondent, it had to prove the title to the land in the 4th Schedule to"
"the  Plaint.  As  said  before,  the  deed  No.668  which  purportedly  has  conveyed  title  to  the"
"Plaintiff-Respondent was not marked during the leading of evidence at the trial. It appears"
"that P3 referred to at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondent’s case is this Deed No.668. As"
"said before, P1, P3, P4 and P5 did not come through the evidence led at the trial. As said"
"before, what was mentioned as P1-P5 at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondent’s case appears"
"to be the documents tendered through an affidavit submitted even prior to the amendment"
"of the Plaint for an aborted injunction application. The learned Court of Appeal Judges has"
"relied on the practice of Court that was approved by the Superior Courts in Sri Lanka Ports"
