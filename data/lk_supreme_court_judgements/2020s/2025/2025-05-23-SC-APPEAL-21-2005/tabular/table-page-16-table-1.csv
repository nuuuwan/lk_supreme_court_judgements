"SC. Appeal No. 21/2005"
"This section applies to this case now, even though it was not in force when the Court of"
"Appeal heard this matter in appeal. As per the section quoted above, it is necessary to object"
"to the document or deed when it was tendered in evidence. If the objection is not reiterated"
"at the close of the case, the document or the deed becomes evidence. In the matter at hand,"
"the documents P1, P3, P4, and P5 were not tendered in evidence to make the first objection."
"Thus, reiteration of objection does not arise to apply the section and consider the documents"
"as evidence."
"On the other hand, one may assume that these documents were not objected at the close of"
"the Plaintiff-Respondent’s case as well as at the time of adopting the evidence which took"
"place  after  7  years  of  the  conclusion  of  the  recording  of  evidence  as  parties  were  in"
"agreement  to  consider  those  documents  as  evidence.  Therefore,  this  Court  prefers  to  see"
"whether  Court  of  Appeal  erred  even  after  considering  the  said  documents  as  evidence."
"Without prejudice to what has been said above that those documents, namely P1, P3, P4 and"
"P5, were not part of the evidence led at the trial, even when those documents are considered"
"as evidence, as explained below, it is clear that the Plaintiff-Respondent cannot prove his"
"title to the land in dispute."
"What is claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent is the land described in the 4th Schedule to the"
"amended Plaint which is described as Lot A2A of Plan No.3065. The aforesaid Plan No."
"3065 had not been tendered in evidence even at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondent’s case"
"as indicated above. Hence, there is an issue as to the true identification of the said land as"
"described in the said 4th Schedule. Whatever it is, as per the averments in the amended Plaint,"
"the  land  described  in  the  4th  schedule  to  the  amended  Plaint  is  a  part  of  Lot  A2  in  Plan"
"No.913-  vide  paragraph  10  of  the  amended  Plaint.  Lot  A1  and  A2  of  Plan  No.913  is"
"described in the 3rd Schedule to the amended Plaint. Plan No. 913 is a subdivision of the"
"land in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint, which is Lot A in Plan No. 408B -vide paragraph 6 of"
"the amended Plaint. What is important to note is that the boundaries and the extent of the"
"land in the Vesting Order, Requisitioning Order and the notice of claim (V1, V1a, V1b, and"
"P6) tally with the boundaries and extent of the land in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint as well"
"as with the those of Lot A in Plan No. 408B (marked P1 with the said affidavit). Thus, it is"
"clear that what was vested with the Defendant-Appellant by the said Vesting Order includes"
"the portion now claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent. Hence, as long as V1 Vesting Order"
