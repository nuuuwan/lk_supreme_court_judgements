"thereby deciding that the Defendant-Appellant is the rightful owner of the lands described",""
"in the Schedule to the Amended Answer for the following reasons:",""
"●","The Plaintiff-Respondent, in his replication, admits that even though the Defendant-"
"","Appellant  had  an  entitlement  to  compensation,  that  claim  is  prescribed.  Thus,  it"
"","indicates that the Defendant Appellant has some right to the relevant portion of land."
"●","P1 to P5 had not been tendered in evidence. However, P2 had been shown to the"
"","Defendant-Appellant’s witness. (This indicates that learned District Judge observed"
"","that even the deed No.668 which gives the title to the Plaintiff-Respondent as per its"
"","stance had not been marked in evidence at the trial.)"
"●","The Plaintiff-Respondent had not taken any attempt to prove its title to the land at"
"","the trial nor had spoken a word about such title through its witnesses. The Plaintiff-"
"","Respondent had also not placed any evidence as to the prescriptive title."
"●","The Defendant-Appellant had placed before the Court the Gazette marked V1.  V1"
"","contained  two  orders,  namely  a  Requisitioning  Order  (V1a)  and  a  Vesting  Order"
"","(V1b). V1 had not been challenged at the trial. Land described in V1a and V1b is the"
"","same as per the boundaries, and the said land appears to be the land in P2 which is"
"","Plan No.913 and V3 which is Plan No.1471. Hence, the land claimed by the Plaintiff-"
"","Appellant falls within the land vested in the Defendant-Appellant and as such, the"
"","Plaintiff-Respondent  cannot  claim  any  title  to  the  land  in  dispute  after  the  said"
"","Vesting Order."
"●","The  Defendant-Appellant  has  valued 
the  damaged  caused  by 
the  Plaintiff-"
"","Respondent and the Plaintiff-Respondent had not challenged the amount but taken"
"","up  the  position  that  that  claim  is  prescribed  but  as  the  Plaintiff-Respondent  is  in"
"","possession it is a continuing damage and, therefore, the claim for damages by the"
"","Defendant-Appellant is not prescribed."
