"SC. Appeal No. 21/2005"
"document is first produced in evidence due to the need of further instructions from the client."
"I am not hesitant admit that the said practice is good law when the relevant document is not"
"impeached through issues, but to apply the said practice, there must be an objection to the"
"document  when  it  was  presented  through  evidence  in  terms  of  section  154  of  the  Civil"
"procedure Code and the same objection should be reiterated at the close of the case when"
"the relevant party reads it in evidence. Since the said documents, namely P1, P3, P4 and P5"
"were not tendered to the Court through evidence led and there was no admission recorded"
"as to the genuineness and/or admissibility of each of those documents, no opportunity was"
"available for the Defendant-Appellant to raise its objections in terms of section 154 of the"
"Civil Procedure Code. Thus, a reiteration of the objections raised previously at the close of"
"the case could not have been arisen as they were not marked through evidence at the trial."
"Thus, it is clear that the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal made a grave error in applying"
"cursus curiae of courts without a necessary component to apply that practice. Aforesaid P1."
"P3, P4 and P5 may be part of the case record as part of the affidavit tendered for the aborted"
"injunction application but they are definitely not part of the evidence led at the trial. The"
"case has to be decided on the issues raised and the facts and law placed before court on those"
"issues. In fact, it is also not clear whether those documents, even though referred to in the"
"body of the affidavit, were tendered with the said affidavit even as copies."
"When one cannot apply the said cursus curae to the case at hand, the purported title Deed"
"No 668 (P3) does not form part of the evidence led at the trial. Then, there cannot be any"
"proof of title of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Thus, the case of the Plaintiff must fail."
"Further, it is necessary to refer to the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 17 of"
"2022  which  was  passed  after  the  said  decision  in  Kadireshan  Kugabalan  v  Sooriya"
"Mudiyanselage Ranaweera. In fact, it appears to have codified the said practice of Court"
"and Section 3(a)(ii) is relevant to the matter in issue as the said Section 3 applies to pending"
"appeals. It reads as follows;"
"“ 3(a)(ii) if the opposing party has objected to it being received as evidence on the deed or"
"document  being  tendered  in  evidence  but  not  objected  at  the  close  of  a  case  when  such"
"document is read in evidence,"
"the court shall admit such deed or document as evidence without requiring further proof;”"
