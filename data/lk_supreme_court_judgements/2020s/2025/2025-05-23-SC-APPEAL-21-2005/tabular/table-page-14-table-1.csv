"2001 and had found that learned District Judge was in grave error for not considering the"
"documents tendered by the Plaintiff-Respondent and came to the conclusion that the Plaintiff"
"Respondent  had  established  its  title  to  the  land  in  dispute.  The  learned  Court  of  Appeal"
"Judges in several places in their judgment has referred to a Plan No.3065 which was never"
"marked or mentioned at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondent’s case. What had been referred"
"to in the said affidavit was a sketch marked X and that too had not been referred to in at the"
"close of the Plaintiff-Respondent’s case. Thus, the genuineness of the said Plan No.3065"
"was never tested. However, it is important to see whether the learned Court of Appeal Judges"
"correctly  followed  the  Court  Practice  (Cursus  Curiae)  as  identified  by  the  aforesaid  Sri"
"Lanka Ports Authority v Jugalinija Boal East and other cases referred to in the Court of"
"Appeal Judgment. It appears that the learned Court of Appeal judges have only applied what"
"is stated in the head note of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Case without considering the"
"contents of the body of the decision. It was an incident where the objection was raised to a"
"marking of the document and not reiterated the said objection at the close of the case. Even"
"in the Balapitiya Gunananda Thero and Faiz v Sitti cases, the facts were similar.  The"
"learned Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant has cited Jamaldeen Abdul Latheef v Abdul"
"Majeed Mohamed Mansoor (2010) 2 Sri L R 333 which also refers to the said practice and"
"it appears that the said practice was not followed as the Counsel did not read the documents"

"of  Dadallage  Mervin  Silva  v  Mohamed  Rosaid  Misthihar  SC  Appeal  45/2010  S  C"
"minutes 11.06.2019 which held that the said practice does not apply to a document which"

"SC Appeal 36/2014 S C minutes 12.02.2021 also, the majority decision was similar to the"
"aforesaid Dadallage Mervin Silva case, but being a member of the said bench, I expressed"
"my separate view accepting said cursus curiae as valid law even with regard to document"
"that is required by law to be attested but stood in agreement with final conclusion of the"
"majority as the document was impeached through issues itself which has to be answered at"
"the end of trial.  It must be said that there was no provision in law that requires a party to"
"read the marked documents at the close of its case. As I have explained in the said case"
"Kadireshan Kugabalan Vs Sooriya Mudiyanselage Ranaweera, this practice appears to"
