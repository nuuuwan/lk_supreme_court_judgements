When the Leave to Appeal application was supported in this matter by the Defendant

Respondent Appellant, the Building Materials Corporation (Hereinafter referred to as the

Defendant-Appellant), against the Judgement made by the Court of Appeal in Case No.

CA-226/94(F) that set aside the Judgement of the learned Additional District Judge in Case

No. DC Colombo 3807/ZL, which dismissed the action of the Plaintiff Appellant

Respondent, Cinemas Limited, (Hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff-Respondent), this

Court on 03.03.2005 granted leave on the questions of law set out in paragraphs 15(a) to (e)

of the Petition dated 02.03.2004. The learned District Judge, while dismissing the action of

the Plaintiff-Respondent as aforesaid, had granted the reliefs prayed by the Defendant-

Appellant.

The Plaintiff-Respondent first filed its Plaint dated 28.08.1981 and then amended it by the

amended Plaint dated 20.11.1984 in the District Court of Colombo against the Defendant-

Appellant. The Position of the Plaintiff-Respondent as per its pleadings is as follows;

The Plaintiff-Respondent is a body corporate duly incorporated and registered under

the provisions of the Companies Ordinance. The Defendant-Appellant is a body

corporate duly established under the provisions of the Sri Lanka State Trading

Corporation Act No. 33 of 1970.

The Chettinad Corporation (Private) Limited of Madras in the Republic of India

(hereinafter Chettinad Ltd.) was the owner of and was entitled to all of the land

depicted as Lot No. 1 in Plan No. 1215 made by L.S. Wickremeratne, Licensed

Surveyor dated 22.04.1946, which is more fully described in the First Schedule to

the amended Plaint as a land of 5 Acres and 26 Perches.

The said Chettinad Ltd. caused the land described in the First Schedule to be

surveyed and subdivided into five allotments of land which are depicted as Lots A

B C D and E in Plan No. 408B dated 24.02.1962 made by V. Siva Sunderam,

Licensed Surveyor. The said Chettinad Ltd. again caused the said Lot A in Plan No.

408B, to be subdivided into three allotments of land, which are depicted as A1 A2

and A3 in Plan No. 913 made by S. Singanayagam, Licensed Surveyor, dated

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

4

30.07.1964. The said Lot A of Plan No. 408B is more fully described in the Second

Schedule to the amended Plaint as a land of 3 Acres and 15.06 Perches.

By Deed No. 668 dated 10.08.1964, attested by T. Devarajan, Notary Public, the said

Chettinad Ltd. transferred Lots A1 and A2 in the said Plan No. 913 together with the

building standing thereon to the Plaintiff-Respondent, Cinemas Limited. The said

two allotments of land A1 and A2 are more fully described in the Third Schedule to

the amended Plaint as allotments of 1 Rood and 1 Perch and 1 Rood and 28.25

perches respectively.

The Plaintiff-Respondent caused said Lot A1 and part of Lot A2 in Plan No. 913 to

be amalgamated together with the land belonging to it and situated on the Northern

boundary of the said Lot A1 and part of A2, and the said amalgamated Lots are

depicted as Lot No. 1 in Plan No. 144 made by E. Thanabalasingam, Licensed

Surveyor, dated 28.03.1979.

By Deed No. 850 attested by D.N. Swaminatham, Notary Public, on 25.04.1980, the

Plaintiff-Respondent, sold, conveyed and transferred the said amalgamated Lots to

Pen Pals Limited and delivered possession.

The Plaintiff-Respondent abovenamed is the owner of the remaining portion of Lot

A2 depicted in Plan No. 913, and the Plaintiff-Respondent and its predecessors in

title have been in exclusive and uninterrupted possession of the said part of Lot A2

for a period of well over 20 years. The said Part of Lot A2 is more fully described in

the 4th Schedule to the amended Plaint and it is approximately one Rood Eighteen

Perches in extent, which is depicted in the sketch annexed and marked X with the

amended Plaint. As per the said 4th Schedule it is also depicted as Lot A2A in Plan

No.3065 made by K. K. Thirunavukarasu, Licensed Surveyor.

By Notice of Claim dated 10.02.1972 given by the Chairman of the Defendant-

Appellant published in Government Gazette Extra-Ordinary No. 14996/15 of

10.02.1972, the following properties described in the Schedule to the said Notice

were declared to be required for the purpose of the Defendant-Appellant. The said

schedule reads as follows;

The building, fixtures, land and premises presently occupied by Messrs. Chettinad

Corporation (Private) Ltd. in extent about 3 acres and 15 perches more or less bearing

assessment Nos. 445 and 541 situated at Sri Sangaraja Mawatha and assessment Nos.

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

5

224, 222/3, 44A, 5, 11 and 12 situated at Bandaranaike Mawatha and bounded as

follows;

o North: Lot B in Plan No. 408B of 24.2.26 made by V. Siva Sunderam,

Licensed Surveyor,

o East: Sri Sangaraja Mawatha,

o South: Premises Nos. 443 and 441, Sri Sangaraja Mawatha, and No. 75/35

Abdul Hameed Street,

o West: By premises No. 1920, Bandaranayake Mawatha

The lands and buildings described in the 4th Schedule to the amended Plaint were not

included in the aforesaid claim and/or the said Chettinad Ltd. ceased to occupy or

possess the same since 10.08.1964, and were not in occupation thereof on the

20.02.1972.

The Defendant-Appellant wrongfully and unlawfully claims that the said land and

buildings described in the said 4th Schedule are included in the aforesaid notice of

claim, and in or about January 1981 wrongfully entered the said lands and erected

buildings thereon and are continuing to build thereon.

A cause of action has accrued to the Plaintiff-Respondent to sue the Defendant for a

declaration that it is entitled to all that land together with the buildings standing

thereon described in the 4th Schedule and for the related reliefs prayed for in the

action filed.

An inquiry was held for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation

payable in respect of the land vested with the Defendant-Appellant Corporation,

under the said notice of claim.

At the said Inquiry, the Defendant-Appellant declared and/or accepted the position

that the land described in the 4th schedule to the Plaint had not vested in the

Appellant, under the said notice of claim.

In view of the said declaration by the Defendant-Appellant and/or in the acceptance

of the position that the land described in the 4th Schedule to the Plaint had not vested

in the Defendant-Appellant Corporation, the said Chettinad Ltd. and/or the Plaintiff-

Respondent refrained from claiming any compensation in respect of the said land

described in the 4th Schedule.

That, therefore, the Appellant is estopped from claiming title to the said land

described in the 4th Schedule to the Plaint.

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

6

Thereby, the Plaintiff- Respondent among other things prayed for:

(a) A judgement declaring the Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled to the part of the land

depicted as lot A2 on aforesaid Plan No. 913 and morefully described in the 4th

Schedule to the amended Plaint;

(b) An order directing the Defendant-Appellant to demolish all buildings erected by

it on the land in question;

(c) A Decree of ejectment directing that the Defendant-Appellant, its servants,

employees, tenants, contractors and all those holding under the Defendant-

Appellant be ejected from the land in question and the delivery of the vacant

possession of the said land,

(d) Damages at the rate of Rs. 90,000/- per month from January 1991 to 31st July

1981 amounting to Rs. 630,000/- and further damages at the said rate from 1st

August 1981 until the Defendant-Appellant, its agents, servants and contractors

are ejected from the land in question and the Plaintiff-Respondent is placed in

quiet possession;

(e) A permanent injunction restraining the Defendant-Appellant its officers,

servants, agents and contractors from entering upon the land in question or

remaining thereon or erecting any further buildings thereon or continuing any

building operations on the said land;

(f) An interim injunction to the effect as in Clause (e) above to be effective until the

final determination of this action;

In response to the Plaint and the amended Plaint, the Defendant-Appellant, first filed its

Answer dated 06.10.1982 and then amended Answer dated 14.12.1984. The Position of the

Defendant-Appellant as per its pleadings is as follows;

A cause of action has not accrued to the Plaintiff-Respondent as set out in the Plaint,

and the Plaintiff-Respondent is not the owner of the allotment of land described in

the 4th Schedule to the Plaint.

As per the Vesting Order made in terms of Section 30(1) of the Sri Lanka State

Trading Corporation Act No.37 of 1970, the land described therein is vested in the

Defendant-Appellant Corporation. (The Boundaries of the land relevant to the said

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

7

vesting order is the same as the boundaries described in the claim notice referred to

in the amended Plaint.)

The land described in the 2nd Schedule to the amended Plaint which is described as

Lot A in aforesaid Plan No. 408B and also as Lots A1, A2 and A3 in the aforesaid

plan No. 913 is the same land which is vested in the Defendant-Appellant as per the

aforesaid Vesting Order published in Government Gazette No. 14996/15 of

11.02.1972. Hence, the disputed land in schedule No.4 of the amended Plaint

belongs to the Defendant-Appellant.

Since around 1978, the Plaintiff-Respondent had been in wrongful and unlawful

occupation of Lot A1 and the Northern portion of Lot A2 depicted in Plan No. 913

causing damages to the Defendant-Appellant.

Further, the Defendant-Appellant counter claimed for title to the land and premises

described in the Schedule to the Answer, for ejectment of the Appellant from Lot A1

and the Northern portion of Lot A2 described in the Schedule to the Answer and for

damages.

Thus, the Defendant-Appellant prayed for the dismissal of the action of the Plaintiff-

Respondent, declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the answer which is

the land described in the Vesting Order, ejectment of the Plaintiff-Respondent from Lot A1

and the northern part of A2 and for damages.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff-Respondent had filed a Replication dated 19.01.1983, stating, inter

alia that:

The Defendant-Appellants claim for damages, if any, are prescribed.

The properties described in the Vesting Order referred in paragraph 5 of the Answer

were only the buildings, fixtures, land and premises as were occupied by Messrs

Chettinad Ltd. as at February 10th, 1972 and no other.

It must be noted that prior to the amendment of the Plaint, the Plaintiff-Respondent had filed

an affidavit in support of the interim injunction application in the original plaint, which as

per the proceedings dated 11.06.82, was not proceeded further on the request of the Plaintiff-

Respondents Counsel before the District Court. Though the same prayers for interim

injunctions were there in the amended Plaint, they too have not been proceeded with. Thus,

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

8

there was no injunction inquiry held. However, with the original application of the

injunction inquiry, an affidavit (with an English Copy) had been tendered, which referred to

certain documents. Those documents are mentioned below with the marking given to them

in the affidavit (Vide affidavit dated 07.09.1981in Sinhala and the affidavit in English

bearing the same date.).

1. A copy of the aforementioned Plan No. 408B as P1

2. A copy of the aforementioned Plan No. 913 as P2

3. A copy of the Deed No. 668 attested by A. Devarajan N.P. as P3

4. A copy of the aforementioned Plan No.144 as P4

5. A copy of the aforementioned Deed No. 850 as P5

6. A sketch drawn by the Plaintiff-Respondent to show the land described in the 4th

Schedule marked as X. (It appears the English copy of the affidavit had not given

the marking X to the said document).

7. The notice of claim published in the Gazette on 10.02.1972 as P6 (This may be

Gazette No. 14996/15 dated 10.02.1972 as per the contents in paragraph 12 of the

said affidavits)

Documents referred to in items No. 1, 2, 6 and 7 appears to have been included in a list at

the end of the amended Plaint. However, no documents can be found attached to the said

affidavit in the brief.

It appears that the trial commenced on 11.02.86, raising issues No.1 to 9 by the Plaintiff-

Respondent and No. 10 to 13 by the Defendant-Appellant. No admissions have been

recorded on that date.

At the trial, A.G. Gunaratne, Assistant Valuer of the Department of Valuation and D.M.

Swaminathan, Attorney-at-Law provided evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff-Respondent

while Anil Pieris, Licensed Surveyor, and L.D. Wilson Joseph, Storekeeper, Building

Materials Corporation provided evidence on behalf of the Defendant-Appellant.

The Plaintiff-Respondent, closed its case reading in evidence the documents P1 to P11.

However, as per the evidence led at the trial, Plaintiff had marked only P6 to P11 through

the aforesaid witnesses it called to give evidence at the trial- vide proceedings at the trial.

The said documents are mentioned below;

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

9

Gazette No.14996/15 dated 10.02.1972 as P6 (This seems to be the Gazette that

contained the notice of claim referred to as P6 in the affidavit mentioned above. The

description of the land in this tallies with the description contained in the

Requisitioning Order and Vesting Order which have also been marked as V1 with

sub markings V1a and V1b during cross examination of the Plaintiff-

Respondents witness Gunaratne).

Valuation report prepared by One N. Nadarajah, Licensed Valuer as P7.

Report containing evidence which appears to be of the compensation inquiry as P8.

Copy of the proceedings which shows certain appearances made before the said

compensation inquiry as P9.

Decision of the Chief Valuer as P10.

A certified copy of the Plan No. 965 as P11 (However, this Plan No.965 is not

available in the brief nor has been tendered with the written submission of the parties.

As per P8 found in the brief, this plan seems to be a plan that indicated the part of

land considered as the part of the land occupied by the Chettinad Ltd. for the

compensation inquiry. Although this Court attempted to trace the original case

record of the District Court, it was of no avail.)

As this P1 to P5 were not admitted document at the trial at the time the Plaintiff-Respondent

closed its case, and they were not marked during the trial through witnesses or admissions

made, there is no clear indication what those P1 to P5 were when they were mentioned at

the close of the Plaintiff-Respondents case. However, the Defendant-Appellant had not

objected to any of the said documents mentioned as P1 to P11 at the close of the Plaintiff-

Respondents case. Perhaps, as the last document mentioned is P11, without recognizing

that P1 to P5 were not marked during the trial through evidence, the Counsel for the

Defendant-Appellant might have inadvertently refrained from making any objections to

them. However, it appears that aforesaid Plan No.913 had been shown to the 2nd witness of

the Plaintiff as P2 during his evidence-in-chief without marking it. It appears that even the

Defendant Appellant had used it in preparing the Plan marked V3. Even if P2 is considered

as a document marked or tendered at the trial, P1, P3, P4 and P5 had not been marked or

tendered or referred to during the trial through witnesses. On the other hand, if any

documents which were not marked during the trial were mentioned at the close of the

Plaintiff-Respondents case, in my view, there was a duty on the part of the counsel for the

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

10

Plaintiff-Respondent to mention what those documents were, unless there was an agreement

to tender them as admitted documents.

Though there was a claim of prescriptive title through long possession raised through issues,

in addition to the claim based on paper tile, the Plaintiff-Respondent had not led any witness

to establish the nature of possession it had over the land in issue or to indicate who possessed

various lots described in the amended Plaint at the time of the Vesting Order. Even the title

deed referred to in the amended Plaint, namely Deed No.668 (P3) was not marked during

the trial except for being mentioned in the said affidavit tendered to the Court for the purpose

of an application for injunction which was not proceeded with as aforesaid. It appears that

the documents referred to as P1 to P5, from and out of the documents referred to as P1 to

P11 at the close of the case of the Plaintiff-Respondent are the documents referred to in the

said affidavit. It should also be noted that the Plaintiff-Respondents claim is for the land

described in the 4th Schedule to the amended Plaint. However, the plan referred to in the said

schedule, namely Plan No.3065, had not been tendered in evidence nor had a plan prepared

on a commission marked to indicate the land in the 4th Schedule to the Plaint. Although,

there was a reference to a sketch marked X in the aforesaid affidavit, it too was not marked

during the trial nor referred to at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondents case.

The Defendant-Appellant had led the evidence of Anil Peris, Licensed Surveyor and of one

Wilson Joseph, Store Keeper of the Defendant-Appellant. Through them the Defendant-

Appellant had referred to certain documents as explained below;

V3- as per the marking made on the document, this appears to be Plan No.1471 dated

30.07.1973 made by the said witness, Anil Peiris L.S. It appears this had been

prepared using plan No. 913 (which appears to have been referred to as P2 in

evidence of said Anil Peiris) and another Plan No.1225. This plan No.1225 appear

to have been referred to as Plan No.1275 or 1235 in several places in the evidence

of the said Licensed Surveyor but has not been marked and cannot be found in the

brief or among the copies of documents tendered along with the written submission.

Thus, even though the Plaintiff-Respondent failed to mark Plan No 913 (P2) at the

trial, it has been spoken to in evidence as P2 through Defendant-Appellants

witnesses.

The Defendant-Appellant had closed its case reading in evidence V1, V2 and V3.

V1 is the Gazette Notice marked through the Plaintiff-Respondents witnesses which

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

11

contained the Requisitioning Order and the Vesting Order. This is the Gazette

No.14996/16 dated 11.02.1972. V2 appears to be the Plan No. 408B which too was

marked through Plaintiff-Respondents witness. No objection has been reiterated at

the close of the Defendant-Appellants case for the said documents marked V1, V2

and V3.

The Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent has referred to Fradd v Fernando 36 N L R 124

in his submissions. This may be to indicate that even the documents marked in the purported

injunction inquiry are part of the case record and they can be considered. In fact, there was

no injunction inquiry as it was not proceeded with on the request of the Plaintiff-

Respondents lawyer before the District Court. On the other hand, the facts relevant to the

above case only indicates a situation where a Court sitting in appeal considering a document

tendered before the Court below but refused by the judge of the Court below. Thus, it is a

consideration of a document as part of the case record, which was in fact tendered during

the trial but refused to be admitted by the trial Judge, as that refusal was considered as

incorrect by the Judges sitting in appeal. It cannot be considered as a decision that allows a

document which was not marked or spoken to at the trial to be considered as evidence at the

trial. The learned Counsel has also referred to Adaicappa Chetty v Thomas Cook and Son

31 N L R 385. This Judgment speaks of a document filed with the Plaint and referred to in

giving evidence at the trial and considered by the judge. In the case at hand, among the

documents not marked during the trial, namely P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5, only P2 has been

referred to in giving evidence.

Many years after the conclusion of the recording of evidence in the matter at hand, on

19.01.1994, the case had been called before another Additional District Judge where the

learned additional District Judge had observed that the documents available in the case

record as tendered during the trial had not been countersigned by the trial judge. On that

date, the said learned Judge had obtained the consent of the parties to consider the said

documents as documents tendered during the trial which appears to have included the said

documents which were not in fact tendered or marked during the trial by the Plaintiff. As P7

to P11 were not available in the case record, on that date, the learned Additional District

Judge had directed the Plaintiff-Respondent to tender them and the learned Additional

District Judge had adopted the evidence led before the predecessor.

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

12

On 26.01.1994, the Additional District Judge delivered the Judgement holding that the

Plaintiff-Respondent had failed to prove its case and hence, dismissed the action with cost

and granted relief prayed for by the Defendant-Appellant in its claim in reconvention,

thereby deciding that the Defendant-Appellant is the rightful owner of the lands described

in the Schedule to the Amended Answer for the following reasons:

The Plaintiff-Respondent, in his replication, admits that even though the Defendant-

Appellant had an entitlement to compensation, that claim is prescribed. Thus, it

indicates that the Defendant Appellant has some right to the relevant portion of land.

P1 to P5 had not been tendered in evidence. However, P2 had been shown to the

Defendant-Appellants witness. (This indicates that learned District Judge observed

that even the deed No.668 which gives the title to the Plaintiff-Respondent as per its

stance had not been marked in evidence at the trial.)

The Plaintiff-Respondent had not taken any attempt to prove its title to the land at

the trial nor had spoken a word about such title through its witnesses. The Plaintiff-

Respondent had also not placed any evidence as to the prescriptive title.

The Defendant-Appellant had placed before the Court the Gazette marked V1. V1

contained two orders, namely a Requisitioning Order (V1a) and a Vesting Order

(V1b). V1 had not been challenged at the trial. Land described in V1a and V1b is the

same as per the boundaries, and the said land appears to be the land in P2 which is

Plan No.913 and V3 which is Plan No.1471. Hence, the land claimed by the Plaintiff-

Appellant falls within the land vested in the Defendant-Appellant and as such, the

Plaintiff-Respondent cannot claim any title to the land in dispute after the said

Vesting Order.

The Defendant-Appellant has valued the damaged caused by the Plaintiff-

Respondent and the Plaintiff-Respondent had not challenged the amount but taken

up the position that that claim is prescribed but as the Plaintiff-Respondent is in

possession it is a continuing damage and, therefore, the claim for damages by the

Defendant-Appellant is not prescribed.

Being aggrieved with the Judgment of the Additional District Judge dated 26.01.1994, the

Plaintiff-Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal. By the Judgment in Case No. CA-

226/94(F), dated 20.01.2004, the Court of Appeal set aside the Judgement of the learned

Additional District Court Judge allowing the appeal of the Plaintiff-Respondent with cost.

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

13

As this appeal is against the said Judgment of the Court of Appeal, now this Court will look

into the certain observations and findings of the Court of Appeal that goes to the root of its

final conclusion over the Judgment of the learned Additional District Judge, as discussed

below, to see whether the Court of Appeal erred in the said Judgment dated 20.01.2004.

The learned Court of Appeal judges observed that it is also the position of the Defendant-

Appellant that the land so vested was described in the aforesaid Plan No.913. Since the

evidence led at the trial indicates that the Defendant-Appellant has not challenged the

correctness of this plan and it also appears that it was used in preparing the plan marked V3

by the Defendant-Appellant, this observation of the Court of Appeal is correct. Further, it is

the position of the Plaintiff-Respondent in his amended Plaint that this Plan No.913 indicates

the subdivision made to Lot A in the Plan No. 408B referred to in the Plaint (Vide paragraph

5 and 2nd schedule of the plaint) which belonged to Chettinad Ltd., as part of the original

extent of 5 Acres and 26.8 Perches that also belonged to Chettinad Ltd. It can be observed

that the outer boundaries of the Plan No.913 which has to be the same as the boundaries of

Lot A in Plan No. 408B referred to in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint tally with boundaries

of the land contemplated in the vesting order. Hence, there cannot be any dispute as to the

land vested in the Defendant-Appellant by the vesting order as the one shown in Plan No.913

as lots A1, A2 and A3.

However, it must be noted that the action was filed by the Plaintiff-Respondent to get a

declaration that it is entitled to the land described in the 4th schedule to the Plaint and to evict

the Defendant-Appellant from the said land. In fact, this action is in essence a rei vindicatio

action as there is no contractual relationship between the parties as to the land in dispute

such as lease or license. Whether it is a rei vindicatio action or not, for the success of the

case of the Plaintiff-Respondent, it had to prove the title to the land in the 4th Schedule to

the Plaint. As said before, the deed No.668 which purportedly has conveyed title to the

Plaintiff-Respondent was not marked during the leading of evidence at the trial. It appears

that P3 referred to at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondents case is this Deed No.668. As

said before, P1, P3, P4 and P5 did not come through the evidence led at the trial. As said

before, what was mentioned as P1-P5 at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondents case appears

to be the documents tendered through an affidavit submitted even prior to the amendment

of the Plaint for an aborted injunction application. The learned Court of Appeal Judges has

relied on the practice of Court that was approved by the Superior Courts in Sri Lanka Ports

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

14

Authority v Jugolinija Boal East (1981) 1 Sri L R 18 , Balapitiya Gunananda Thero v

Talalle Methananda Thero (1997) 2 Sri L R 101 and Faiz Vs. Sitti B.A.S.L. news July

2001 and had found that learned District Judge was in grave error for not considering the

documents tendered by the Plaintiff-Respondent and came to the conclusion that the Plaintiff

Respondent had established its title to the land in dispute. The learned Court of Appeal

Judges in several places in their judgment has referred to a Plan No.3065 which was never

marked or mentioned at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondents case. What had been referred

to in the said affidavit was a sketch marked X and that too had not been referred to in at the

close of the Plaintiff-Respondents case. Thus, the genuineness of the said Plan No.3065

was never tested. However, it is important to see whether the learned Court of Appeal Judges

correctly followed the Court Practice (Cursus Curiae) as identified by the aforesaid Sri

Lanka Ports Authority v Jugalinija Boal East and other cases referred to in the Court of

Appeal Judgment. It appears that the learned Court of Appeal judges have only applied what

is stated in the head note of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Case without considering the

contents of the body of the decision. It was an incident where the objection was raised to a

marking of the document and not reiterated the said objection at the close of the case. Even

in the Balapitiya Gunananda Thero and Faiz v Sitti cases, the facts were similar. The

learned Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant has cited Jamaldeen Abdul Latheef v Abdul

Majeed Mohamed Mansoor (2010) 2 Sri L R 333 which also refers to the said practice and

it appears that the said practice was not followed as the Counsel did not read the documents

at the close of the case. The learned Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant has cited the case

of Dadallage Mervin Silva v Mohamed Rosaid Misthihar SC Appeal 45/2010 S C

minutes 11.06.2019 which held that the said practice does not apply to a document which

has to be proved in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance. However, in Kadireshan Kugabalan v Sooriya Mudiyanselage Ranaweera

SC Appeal 36/2014 S C minutes 12.02.2021 also, the majority decision was similar to the

aforesaid Dadallage Mervin Silva case, but being a member of the said bench, I expressed

my separate view accepting said cursus curiae as valid law even with regard to document

that is required by law to be attested but stood in agreement with final conclusion of the

majority as the document was impeached through issues itself which has to be answered at

the end of trial. It must be said that there was no provision in law that requires a party to

read the marked documents at the close of its case. As I have explained in the said case

Kadireshan Kugabalan Vs Sooriya Mudiyanselage Ranaweera, this practice appears to

be a result of the tentative nature of the objection that may have to take place when a

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

15

document is first produced in evidence due to the need of further instructions from the client.

I am not hesitant admit that the said practice is good law when the relevant document is not

impeached through issues, but to apply the said practice, there must be an objection to the

document when it was presented through evidence in terms of section 154 of the Civil

procedure Code and the same objection should be reiterated at the close of the case when

the relevant party reads it in evidence. Since the said documents, namely P1, P3, P4 and P5

were not tendered to the Court through evidence led and there was no admission recorded

as to the genuineness and/or admissibility of each of those documents, no opportunity was

available for the Defendant-Appellant to raise its objections in terms of section 154 of the

Civil Procedure Code. Thus, a reiteration of the objections raised previously at the close of

the case could not have been arisen as they were not marked through evidence at the trial.

Thus, it is clear that the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal made a grave error in applying

cursus curiae of courts without a necessary component to apply that practice. Aforesaid P1.

P3, P4 and P5 may be part of the case record as part of the affidavit tendered for the aborted

injunction application but they are definitely not part of the evidence led at the trial. The

case has to be decided on the issues raised and the facts and law placed before court on those

issues. In fact, it is also not clear whether those documents, even though referred to in the

body of the affidavit, were tendered with the said affidavit even as copies.

When one cannot apply the said cursus curae to the case at hand, the purported title Deed

No 668 (P3) does not form part of the evidence led at the trial. Then, there cannot be any

proof of title of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Thus, the case of the Plaintiff must fail.

Further, it is necessary to refer to the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 17 of

2022 which was passed after the said decision in Kadireshan Kugabalan v Sooriya

Mudiyanselage Ranaweera. In fact, it appears to have codified the said practice of Court

and Section 3(a)(ii) is relevant to the matter in issue as the said Section 3 applies to pending

appeals. It reads as follows;

3(a)(ii) if the opposing party has objected to it being received as evidence on the deed or

document being tendered in evidence but not objected at the close of a case when such

document is read in evidence,

the court shall admit such deed or document as evidence without requiring further proof;

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

16

This section applies to this case now, even though it was not in force when the Court of

Appeal heard this matter in appeal. As per the section quoted above, it is necessary to object

to the document or deed when it was tendered in evidence. If the objection is not reiterated

at the close of the case, the document or the deed becomes evidence. In the matter at hand,

the documents P1, P3, P4, and P5 were not tendered in evidence to make the first objection.

Thus, reiteration of objection does not arise to apply the section and consider the documents

as evidence.

On the other hand, one may assume that these documents were not objected at the close of

the Plaintiff-Respondents case as well as at the time of adopting the evidence which took

place after 7 years of the conclusion of the recording of evidence as parties were in

agreement to consider those documents as evidence. Therefore, this Court prefers to see

whether Court of Appeal erred even after considering the said documents as evidence.

Without prejudice to what has been said above that those documents, namely P1, P3, P4 and

P5, were not part of the evidence led at the trial, even when those documents are considered

as evidence, as explained below, it is clear that the Plaintiff-Respondent cannot prove his

title to the land in dispute.

What is claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent is the land described in the 4th Schedule to the

amended Plaint which is described as Lot A2A of Plan No.3065. The aforesaid Plan No.

3065 had not been tendered in evidence even at the close of the Plaintiff-Respondents case

as indicated above. Hence, there is an issue as to the true identification of the said land as

described in the said 4th Schedule. Whatever it is, as per the averments in the amended Plaint,

the land described in the 4th schedule to the amended Plaint is a part of Lot A2 in Plan

No.913- vide paragraph 10 of the amended Plaint. Lot A1 and A2 of Plan No.913 is

described in the 3rd Schedule to the amended Plaint. Plan No. 913 is a subdivision of the

land in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint, which is Lot A in Plan No. 408B -vide paragraph 6 of

the amended Plaint. What is important to note is that the boundaries and the extent of the

land in the Vesting Order, Requisitioning Order and the notice of claim (V1, V1a, V1b, and

P6) tally with the boundaries and extent of the land in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint as well

as with the those of Lot A in Plan No. 408B (marked P1 with the said affidavit). Thus, it is

clear that what was vested with the Defendant-Appellant by the said Vesting Order includes

the portion now claimed by the Plaintiff-Respondent. Hence, as long as V1 Vesting Order

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

17

remains valid, the Plaintiff-Respondents claim for title to the land in the 4th Schedule to the

amended Plaint has to be unsuccessful.

Even though the learned Court of Appeal Judges have referred to a stance taken up by the

Plaintiff-Respondent that the Defendant-Appellant, at the compensation inquiry, had

admitted that the land in dispute was not vested in the Defendant-Appellant and therefore,

its predecessors declined to claim compensation for the land in dispute, there appears to be

no evidence to establish that stance. On the other hand, any such statement made during a

compensation inquiry cannot amend the Vesting Order. It is up to the parties who are

affected by the Vesting Order to make their claims for compensation. It appears that the

learned Court of Appeal judges had placed much reliance on the words presently occupied

by Messers. Chettinad Corporation (private) Ltd. in the description of the land in the

Vesting Order. Occupation is a fact that may vary easily. It may not be the same when the

information was collected to prepare the schedule for the Requisitioning Order and Vesting

Order and at the time of their publication. A land has to be identified by the boundaries

describing it and extent of the land may also be helpful. As said before, boundaries and

extent of the land in Vesting Order agree with the boundaries of the land in the 2nd Schedule

of the Plaint. Thus, the Plaintiff cannot claim any title to the land in the 4th Schedule to the

Plaint as it should fall within the boundaries of the land in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint.

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent has attempted to challenge the

Requisitioning Order and Vesting Order indicating that said orders are ultra vires for the

reasons set out in his submission. Anyhow, it must be stated that no one challenged the

validity of those orders before the District Court based on such grounds. No issue was raised

there on these grounds. Case has to be decided on the issues raised. The Plaintiff-Respondent

cannot be allowed to take up new position in appeal. If the Plaintiff-Respondent wanted to

challenge the Requisitioning Order and Vesting Order on the ground of vires of the

authorities who issued them, the Plaintiff-Respondent had sufficient time to invoke the writ

jurisdiction of the proper forum. If such steps were not taken up by the Plaintiff-Respondent

to challenge the said orders on the grounds of the vires of the relevant authority, the learned

District Judge or any other forum has to consider that all official acts have been regularly

performed.

What was discussed above is sufficient to show that the learned Court of Appeal Judges

erred in setting aside the judgment of the learned District Judge and granting relief to the

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

18

Plaintiff-Respondent on the premise that the Plaintiff-Respondent proved its title to the land

in dispute.

When the leave to appeal was granted, this Court allowed the questions of law outlined

under paragraphs 15 (a) (e) in the Petition which are quoted and answered below:

Q. a) Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in arriving at the conclusion that the

documents marked P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 have been led in evidence by the

Respondent? (in view of the fact that these documents were in fact produced at the

trial)

A. Answered in the affirmative, but in fact, except P2, other documents were not tendered

or referred to through evidence at the trial. P2, plan No.913 had been shown to

witnesses.

Q. b) Has the Court of Appeal erred in law and misdirected itself in arriving at the

conclusion that the Respondent had proven its title to the land in dispute?

A. Answered in the affirmative.

Q. c) Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in arriving at the conclusion that the

Respondent had identified the corpus?

A. Answered in the affirmative.

Q. d) Has the Court of Appeal erred in proceeding to give judgement in favour of the

Respondent on the basis that the Respondent has proved its title to the corpus and

identified same?

A. Answered in the affirmative.

Q. e) Has the Court of Appeal erred in coming to the conclusion that the disputed land

has not been vested in the Appellant?

A. Answered in the affirmative.

SC. Appeal No. 21/2005

For the reasons discussed above, this appeal is allowed and the judgment of the Court of

Appeal dated 20.04.2004 is set aside. The Judgment of the District Court dated 26.01.1984

is restored. The Defendant-Appellant is entitled to the Costs of all three courts.

Appeal allowed with costs.
