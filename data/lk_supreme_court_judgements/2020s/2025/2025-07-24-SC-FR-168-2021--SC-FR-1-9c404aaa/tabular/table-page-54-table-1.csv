"73. In  this  context,  it  is  relevant  to  note  here  that  the  Director  General  of"
"Merchant  Shipping  had  taken  prompt  action  to  report  the  situation"
"onboard the vessel MV X-Press Pearl to TSIB on 21.05.2021 through an"
"email sent at 1.39 p.m. This is indicative of the importance placed by him"
"to have an independent investigation conducted into the incident in the"
"vessel carrying the Singapore flag."
"74. It became apparent that some of the factual references made by counsel"
"and  certain  findings  that  were  relied  on  contained  in  the  Singapore"
"Report, are at variance with the findings made by this Court by relying"
"on  direct  evidence  presented  before  it,  by  way  of  material  tendered"
"annexed to Affidavits, vouching for accuracy. It is in these circumstances,"
"that the necessity arose to make references to the factual findings made"
"by the TSIB, particularly to the ones that do not align with the findings"
"made by this Court."
"75. Hence, whenever this Court found that the factual findings run parallel"
"to  TSIB  findings,  such  is  mentioned  along  with  the  evidence  that  was"
"relied on to arrive at such findings. Similarly, where the findings differ,"
"that too is taken note of and tested against the available evidence. This"
"exercise  is  limited  only  to  making  references  to  factual  findings  that"
"disclose what had taken place onboard the vessel during its most crucial"
"times."
"76. This  Court  is  very  much  conscious  of  its  Constitutional  mandate  in"
"seeking  out  for  truth,  in  arriving  at  its  own  findings  on  the  issues"
"presented before it for determination by  the parties.  This Court would"
"not  shirk  away from  effectively  discharging  the  primary  responsibility"
"conferred on it, and in that regard, certainly would not be guided by the"
"views expressed by other entities, and would not use them as substitutes."
"77. In fact, it was this Court that pointed out to counsel who made references"
"to  the  Singapore  Report,  that  “The  sole  objective  of  TSIB’s  marine  safety"
"investigations  is  the  prevention  of  marine  accidents  and  incidents.  The  safety"
"investigations  do  not  seek  to  apportion  blame  or  liability.  Accordingly,  TSIB"
