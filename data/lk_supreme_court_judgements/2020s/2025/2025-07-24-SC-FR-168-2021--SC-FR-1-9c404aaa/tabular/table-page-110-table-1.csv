"235. As already noted, apparently this is the item of information that led the"
"land-based Operators into a state of complacency. Assuming that the leak"
"was  due  to  a  damage  in  a  single  IBC  stored  in  the  Container,  that"
"particular  IBC  had  by then  released  all  of  its  contents  consisting  of  1.5"
"metric tons of Nitric acid in its totality onto the hatch cover, right above"
"the Cargo Hold No. 2 of the vessel. Some of that vast quantity of corrosive"
"Acid would have washed away, while some may have soaked into the"
"sawdust. But a significant volume of that 1.5 metric tons of  Nitric  acid"
"had certainly found its way down into the Cargo Hold No. 2 penetrating"
"through the steel plates of the hatch covers onto the Containers, stowed"
"within  that  hold.  As  a  result,  those  containers  were  exposed  to  being"
"washed down with a strong corrosive liquid. The large volume of water"
"found in the bilge of the Cargo Hold No. 2 on 13.05.2021 is a determinant"
"indicator  that  the  hatch  covers  did  not  effectively  prevent  the  water,"
"which was used to wash away the Acid, coming into the Cargo Hold No."
"2 of the vessel."
