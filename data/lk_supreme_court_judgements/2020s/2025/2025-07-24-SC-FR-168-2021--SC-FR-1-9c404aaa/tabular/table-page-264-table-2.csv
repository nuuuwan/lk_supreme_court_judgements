"629. In  the  Affidavit  of  the  Harbor  Master  Marked  “Y1”  he  has  stated  as"
"“20. All goods coming into Sri Lanka are subject to inspection by Sri"
"Lankan Customs, including dangerous goods. Practically, it is not"
"possible  to  board  every  vessel  that  enters  a  port  in  Sri  Lanka  and"
"inspect whether the cargo onboard the vessel has been duly labelled,"
"packed and stowed. It is therefore usual practice, if there is nothing"
"blatantly 
erroneous 
in 
the  dangerous  goods 
list  or  otherwise"
"disclosed  by  the  shipping  agent, 
for  the  SLPA  to  rely  on  the"
"declarations given by the shipping agent as a true statement."
"21.  Generally,  an  irregularity  in  the  packing  and  storage  of  the"
"containers  or  cargo 
for  example  a 
leaking  container  would  be"
"disclosed in or accompany the declaration by the shipping agent of"
"the  vessel.  This  being  standard 
international  practice.  This 
is"
"especially true in relation to dangerous cargo.”"
