"645. The Harbour Master’s Affidavit records that by the time the inspections"
"were completed, it had become apparent that the situation on board MV"
"X-Press  Pearl  was  unclear  and  remained  potentially  hazardous.  In  the"
"absence of a report from MV X-Press Pearl, the Harbor Master concluded"
"the following:"
"(a) The vessel presented a serious fire risk, and in the absence of full"
"clarity regarding the condition on board, it would be unsafe to"
"permit the vessel to enter port."
"(b) Allowing berthing would have endangered the port personnel,"
"infrastructure, and adjacent vessels."
"(c) As  per  the  report  of  the  boarding  team,  the  fire  had  spread"
"beyond a single container, and the thick smoke emerging from"
"the Cargo Hold No. 2 indicated that the fire had likely spread"
"within the hold."
"646. Therefore, this Court holds that the Harbour Master’s decision to deny"
"berthing and permit only the continuation of the anchorage was a lawful"
"and reasonable exercise of the discretion conferred on him by the SLPA"
"Act and its Regulations. This Court further holds that, the decision of the"
"Harbour Master referred to above was in fact in the best interests of the"
"Colombo Port, and did not violate any obligation cast on Sri Lanka and"
"its competent authorities towards MV X-Press Pearl."
