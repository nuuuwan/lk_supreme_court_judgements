"Duties of public authorities and State officials"
"666. The  Court  will  consider  whether  MEPA  and  other  public  authorities"
"carried  out  their  responsibilities  under  the  Act  with  appropriate  care,"
"timeliness, and authority. In particular;"
"i.  Whether the institutional arrangements in place were sufficient"
"to support timely and effective decision-making."
"ii.  Whether the directives issued under the Act were adequate and"
"enforceable."
"667. In  order  to  fully  evaluate  the  nature  of  MEPA’s  response,  the  Court"
"considers it necessary to set out in brief the sequence of actions taken by"
"MEPA  during  the  relevant  period.  This  chronology  has  been  mainly"
"drawn from the document “2A16” annexed to the Affidavit of the Former"
"Chairperson  of  MEPA  dated  14.06.2024,  and  other  pleadings  before"
"Court."
