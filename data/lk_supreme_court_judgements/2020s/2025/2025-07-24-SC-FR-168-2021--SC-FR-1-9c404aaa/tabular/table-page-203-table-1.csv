"510. This  Court  has  examined  the  ‘explanation’  provided  by  the  Attorney",""
"","General for the non-prosecution of the Owner and the Operator(s) of MV"
"","X-Press  Pearl.  Court  notes  that,  if  the  Attorney  General  was  genuinely"
"","interested in indicting the Owner and the Operator(s) of the vessel, steps"
"","could have been taken since November 2022 (even after despatching the"
"","indictment), and if such steps were taken in an expedient manner and in"
"","good  faith,  a  second  indictment  against  such  Owner  and  Operator(s)"
"","could have been preferred by now. Furthermore, while the Court agrees"
"","that  extradition  is  a  time  consuming  and  challenging  process,  merely"
"","indicting  a  company  incorporated  overseas  is  not  a  time  consuming,"
"","protracted  or  challenging  process.  What  would  be  required  is  for  the"
"","completion of the investigation and summons of Court to be served on"
"","such Owner and Operator(s) through the relevant procedure. This Court"
"","notes  that  the  said  procedure  is  not  a  challenging  process,  particularly"
"given 
the  ability 
to 
invoke 
the  relevant  provisions  of","the  Mutual"
"","Assistance  in  Criminal  Matter  Act  of  Sri  Lanka  and  the  corresponding"
"","statute of Singapore. Thus, even if it was not practically possible for the"
"","Owner  and  the  Operator(s)  to  have  been  indicted  in  November  2022"
"","alongside the Master and the local Agent of the vessel, had the Attorney"
"General  been  discharging  his  statutory  functions","in  good  faith  and"
"","diligently, the second indictment could have been dispatched quite some"
"","time ago and that case would also be pending by now. The learned ASG"
"","in his post-hearing written submissions has made no reference at all to"
"","that procedure having been even commenced. Furthermore, this Court"
"","also notes that the raising of certain preliminary objections in the High"
"","Court  by  learned  counsel  for  the  accused  in  the  case  filed  against  the"
"","Master, the local Agent and its Directors and principal officers, in no way"
"","would  have  been  an  impediment  towards  the  non-indictment  of  the"
"Owner and the Operator(s) of MV X-Press Pearl.",""
