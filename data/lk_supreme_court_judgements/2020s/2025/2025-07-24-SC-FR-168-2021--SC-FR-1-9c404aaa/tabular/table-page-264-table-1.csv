"627. Accordingly, 
the  Harbor  Master 
is  vested  with","the  discretion 
to"
"determine  whether  a  vessel  carrying  dangerous  goods","should  be"
"","permitted to enter the Port limits. It was further argued that in this case,"
"","such discretion was exercised based on the declaration submitted by the"
"Local Agent of the Vessel.",""
"628. The  Declaration  was  formally  completed  and  certified  by  the  local",""
"","Agent of the vessel as properly packed and safe for transit. The container"
"","carrying Nitric acid was listed as “in-transit cargo,” not for discharge. In"
"","any case, at the point of receiving the Dangerous Goods Declaration, the"
"","Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority  was  not  aware  of  any  defect,  damage,  or"
"","leakage involving the Nitric acid container, nor was it informed of any"
"","imminent risk of fire on board the vessel. Accordingly, permission was"
"granted to enter the outer anchorage as per the standard practice.",""
