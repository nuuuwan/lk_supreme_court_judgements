"750. Paragraph  3.5  calls  for  an  “objective  analysis”  of  the  relative  risks  of"
"permitting or refusing access to refuge."
"751. Paragraph 3.11 requires a comparative evaluation between leaving the"
"vessel at sea and moving it closer to shore."
"752. Paragraph 3.12 reiterates that, while there is no absolute obligation to"
"grant  refuge,  authorities  “should  weigh  all  the  factors  and  risks  in  a"
"balanced manner and give shelter whenever reasonably possible.”"
"753. Appendix 2.2.2 further instructs States to consider meteorological and"
"oceanographic conditions, including whether the proposed refuge offers"
"protection from heavy winds and rough seas."
"754. The question before this court is not whether the authorities were under"
"a strict duty to permit refuge, but whether their actions were guided by"
"a  risk-informed,  structured,  and  timely  decision-making.  The  Court"
"notes  that  no  supporting  technical  assessment  has  been  produced  to"
"demonstrate  the  basis  on  which  this  location  was  selected  over  other"
"potential sites away from the adverse monsoon weather conditions that"
"prevailed. In this regard, the Court further observes that no evidence has"
"been placed before court regarding comparative risk analysis informing"
"the selection of the 50-nautical-mile location. The record does not reflect"
"any  documentation  from  MEPA,  the  Ports  Authority,  or  the  Navy"
"assessing  the  relative  risks  associated  with  remaining  at  the  initial  site"
"versus  relocating 
to  other  potential  refuges.  The  omission  of  such"
"analysis raises concern as to whether the choice of the place of refuge was"
"a  result  of  risk-informed  deliberation  or  merely  an  administrative"
"consensus reached in principle."
"755. It is relevant to note that although a meeting was held on 22nd May, the"
"directive  concerning  the  50-nautical-mile  tow  was  not  issued  until  25th"
"May.  Even 
then, 
the 
instructions  were  given 
in 
conditional  and"
"somewhat discretionary terms. The sequence of events presented before"

301"
