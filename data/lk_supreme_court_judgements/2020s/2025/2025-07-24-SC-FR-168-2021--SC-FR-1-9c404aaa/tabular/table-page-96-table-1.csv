"is  clearly  demonstrable  from  the  Affidavit  of  Lim  Kin  Seng  dated"
"04.11.2024,  wherein  he  averred  that  “the  relevant  Respondents  reasonably"
"understood that the smoke referred to were fumes rather than smoke and that the"
"fumes observed were caused by chemical reaction to the Vessel’s deck paintwork"
"and that there was no immediate risk of fire onboard.” Interestingly, he then"
"attributed that the reason to seek permission from Colombo was due to"
"the  smoke  from  the  container  and  the  crew  having  heard  noises  like"
"drums toppling over from the leaking container. This explanation can not"
"be  accepted  as  being  a  reasonable  explanation,  since  the  Operators,  in"
"spite of the fact that the crew heard the IBSs were falling down inside the"
"container and thereby making the Nitric acid flow significantly increased"
"due to these damaged IBS’s, nonetheless determined  that “there was no"
"immediate risk of fire onboard”. That determination made no difference to"
"the  condition  of  the  vessel  as  that  had  been  the  Operator’s  consistent"
"position since the vessel left Hazira."
