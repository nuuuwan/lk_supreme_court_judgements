"necessary to probe such allegations. While the Applications were being"
"heard, on 7th February 2025 this Court made an order on the Director-"
"General  of  the  Commission  to  Investigate  Allegations  of  Bribery  or"
"Corruption  (CIABOC)  to  conduct  investigations  into  the  allegations  of"
"Bribery and Corruption. By his letter dated 16th May 2025, the Director"
"General  of 
the  CIABOC  sought 
time 
to  conduct 
the 
investigation."
"Following  the  completion  of  the  hearing,  on  16th  July  2025  the  Court"
"issued  another  directive  to  the  Director  General  of  the  CIABOC  to"
"forward  an  Interim  Report  on  investigations  conducted.  By  his  letter"
"dated  18th  July  2025,  the  Director  General  reported  back  to  the  Court"
"informing  this  Court  of  the  outcome  of  the  investigation  that  is  being"
"conducted.  The  Interim  Report  received  reveals  that  the  CIABOC  has"
"commenced  an  investigation  into  the  incident  relating  to  MV  X-Press"
"Pearl environmental disaster. The said Interim Report does not contain"
"any 
information  at  all  pertaining 
to 
the  allegation  of  Bribery  or"
"Corruption. Therefore, it is imperative that the entire matter referred to"
"in the several speeches of the Members of Parliament referred to above"
"should  be 
investigated 
into  by 
the  said  Commission  afresh.  Such"
"investigation on the one hand will result in determining whether there"
"have  been  instances  of  bribery  and  or  corruption  associated  with  any"
"other  the  matters  referred  to  by  Mr.  Senany  Dayaratne.  If  so,  through"
"further  investigations,  investigational  material  could  be  gathered  with"
"the view to identifying perpetrators of offences and prosecuting them. If"
"on the other hand  investigations do not reveal that there has  been any"
"bribery or corruption, such investigational findings  will result in those"
"against whom allegations presently lie being cleared of the accusations"
"against them. What is unhealthy and inappropriate is for the allegations"
"to remain in limbo."
