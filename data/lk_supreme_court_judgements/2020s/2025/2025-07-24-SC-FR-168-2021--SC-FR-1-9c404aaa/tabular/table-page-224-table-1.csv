"of Colombo, the Plaintiff (GOSL) would have at least one Defendant in"
"Sri Lanka against whom the decree could be enforced."
"537. Mr. Pulle’s main argument in favour of the Attorney General’s decision"
"to institute criminal proceedings in the SICC was based on the possibility"
"that should action have been filed in a Sri Lankan court, and the GOSL"
"won  the  case,  the  Plaintiff  (GOSL)  would  be  left  with  only  a  ‘piece  of"
"paper’ (a reference to the decree / writ of execution) which could not be"
"enforced against the owner and the Operators of X-Press Pearl, since they"
"did  not  have  any  assets  in  Sri  Lanka.  What  Mr.  Pulle  appears  to  have"
"overlooked  is  the  fact  that,  both  the  owner  of  X-Press  Pearl  and  its"
"Operators do have their assets (in the form of vessels) regularly calling"
"over at the Port of Colombo, and the decree issued by the High Court of"
"the  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  exercising  admiralty 
jurisdiction  can  be"
"enforced against such an asset. Furthermore, had the local Agent of X-"
"Press  Pearl  been  cited  as  a  culpable  defendant  (on  the  footing  of  such"
"Agent’s actions and omissions also having contributed to the pollution),"
"then, there was an additional reason for the Owner and the Operators of"
"X-Press Pearl to satisfy the decree issued by a Sri Lankan court in favour"
"of the GOSL."
"538. Notwithstanding 
the 
afore-stated 
reasons 
including 
the  opinion"
"expressed by the three-member legal experts, Mr. Pulle was not willing"
"to  appreciate 
the  strategic  value  and  wisdom 
in 
instituting 
legal"
"proceedings in Sri Lanka against the Owner, Operators, local Agent and"
"the insurers of X-Press Pearl."
"Conclusion"
"539. This  Court  appreciates  the  complexities  of  the  decision  the  Attorney"
"General  was  called  upon  to  take  with  regard  to  the  institution  of  civil"
"legal  action  against 
the  X-Press  Pearl  group  of  companies,  which"
"according  to  the  State  was  responsible  for  the  devastating  pollution"
"caused  to  the  marine  environment.  Court  notes  that  the  learned  ASG"
"adduced  only  one  factor  in  favour  of  the  decision  by  the  Attorney"
"SC/FR 168, 176, 184 & 277/2021 – “MV X-PRESS PEARL MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CASE” - JUDGMENT 
224"
