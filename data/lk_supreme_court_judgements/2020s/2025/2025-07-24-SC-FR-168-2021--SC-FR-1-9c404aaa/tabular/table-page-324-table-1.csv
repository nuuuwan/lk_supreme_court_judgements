"have the jurisdiction to decide on this matter as there is already domestic"
"legislation pertaining to pollution of marine waters."
"818. Responding 
to 
that  argument, 
learned 
counsel 
representing 
the"
"Petitioners had two main arguments. Firstly, it was contended that the"
"jurisdiction of the Supreme Court regarding  Fundamental rights could"
"not be limited in such a manner given the power conferred by Articles 17"
"and 126 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Secondly, it was argued that the"
"jurisdiction granted by the aforementioned Marine Pollution Prevention"
"Act, No. 35 of 2008 could only be invoked by the Marine Environment"
"Protection Authority, whereas in the matter at hand, the interests of the"
"Petitioners 
acting 
in  public 
interest  ought 
to  be  given 
the  due"
"consideration."
"819. On careful consideration of the opposing arguments, this Court wishes"
"to express  its  disagreement with the  submission  of  learned  President’s"
"Counsel  for  the  Non-State  Respondents  (X-Press  Pearl  group).  That  is"
"due to the following reasons. First, the PPP is now a legal principle that"
"is  engrained 
in  the 
legal  system  of  Sri  Lanka  whereby 
it  operates"
"independent of the Rio Declaration, and thus, the norms contained in the"
"Rio  Declaration  merely  support  the  position  contained  in  Sri  Lanka’s"
"unwritten law. Second, in examining the developing jurisprudence of the"
"Supreme Court in this area, it is seen that there have been instances where"
"Non-State actors have been held liable under the Polluter Pays Principle"
"even where there is domestic legislation covering that particular area. In"
"Edirisinghe  Muhandiram  Appuhamilage  Tharanga  and  Another  v."
"Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and Others [SC/FR 413/2021 – SC"
"Minutes of 5th April 2021], a private license holder was held liable for their"
"violation  of  Article  12  (1)  of  the  Constitution  under  the  Polluter  Pays"
"Principle  albeit  there  being  domestic  legislation  already  covering  the"
"area.  The  case  concerned  gravel  mining  and  the  subsequent  pollution"
"caused to groundwater in the area, the judgment notes several sections"
"of  the  National  Environmental  Act,  No.  47  of  1980  as  amended  by  the"
"National  Environmental 
(Amendment)  Act,  No.  56  of  1988  which"
"SC/FR 168, 176, 184 & 277/2021 – “MV X-PRESS PEARL MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CASE” - JUDGMENT 
324"
