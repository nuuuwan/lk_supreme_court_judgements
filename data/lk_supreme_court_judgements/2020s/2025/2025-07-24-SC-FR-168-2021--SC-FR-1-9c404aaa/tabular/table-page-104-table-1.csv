"from  19.05.2021,  for  some  undisclosed  reason,  decided  to  make  the"
"required  application  only  on  20.05.2021  at  10.19  a.m.,  that  too  after  a"
"hiatus that lasted more than 20 hours. Strangely, the subject of his email"
"is reflected as “URGENT”."
"218. The obvious inaction on the part of the local Agent to make the request"
"urgently  disregarding  the  specific  instructions  issued  by  the  Marine"
"Superintendent  is  surprising  as  the  latter  had  emphasised  in  his  email"
"that “it is very risky to keep” the leaking Container onboard. Hettiarachchi"
"accepted this position when he averred that his Company “… wrote to the"
"Port of Colombo requesting permission to discharge the Nitric Acid container"
"threat.” The word used by Hettiarachchi to describe the impact of keeping"
"the leaking Container onboard to the vessel by using the word “threat”,"
"denotes his own realisation of Captain Yong Sheng Wu’s reference that"
"“it is very risky to keep onboard” that container."
"219. But  the  actions  of  Samaranayake  and  the  explanation  offered  for  the"
"delay  in  making  the  request  seems  to  have  been  advanced  before  this"
"Court, in order to conceal an underlying sinister motive. In response to"
"the  instructions 
issued  to  make  a  request,  Sampathawaduge  of  Sea"
"Consortium Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd, wrote to Terence Goh at 4.57 p.m., (local"
"time) on 19.05.2021 stating that “We will check with HM, Safety office and"
"terminal by tomorrow morning and let you know the possibility of discharging"
"same since HM office  and Safety office is closed now.” Hettiarachchi, in his"
"Affidavit also had averred that “Harbour Master’s Office and Safety Office"
"were closed at the time the 11A Respondent received the aforementioned email"
"and this fact was informed to those on the email thread”."
"220. Therefore,  the  delay  in  responding  to  the  Direction  by  the  Marine"
"Superintendent would have disturbed the Master, who was anxious to"
"discharge the Container in Colombo on the first available opportunity."
"The WhatsApp chat that had taken place between the Master and Terence"
"Goh on 19.05.2021, echoes the explanation offered by the local Agent on"
"the  delay  in  making  a  request.  At  5.28  p.m.,  Goh  texted  to  Master  on"
