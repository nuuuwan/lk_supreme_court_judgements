"Master or they have chosen to ignore the established procedure, if there"
"was one."
"214. In the Singapore Report it is noted that “The responsibility and authority"
"of  the  designated  person  or  persons  should  include  monitoring  the  safety  and"
"pollution  prevention  aspects  of  the  operation  of  each  ship  and  ensuring  that"
"adequate resources and shore-based support are applied, as required.” (vide foot"
"note 2, at page 5)."
"215. Interestingly, the email sent by Captain Yong Sheng Wu directed at 1.37"
"p.m.  from  his  office  at  Singapore  contained  a  clear  decision.  With  that"
"email, Captain Yong Sheng Wu directed Terence Goh “… to ensure this"
"DG container to be discharged in Port of Colombo”. Samaranayake also was"
"a recipient of this email, which he read and deleted around 7.08 p.m., on"
"19.05.2021. This is one of the two emails received by Samaranayake from"
"the Marine Superintendent, which conveyed a specific direction on him"
"to  make  a  request  to  discharge  the 
leaking  Container  at  Colombo,"
"although  he  had  constantly  received  requests  from  the  Master,  who"
"unsuccessfully  tried  to  initiate  the  discharging  process  at  Colombo  for"
"the past several days."
"216. Admittedly, 
the 
first  email  addressed 
to 
the  Harbour  Master  by"
"Samaranayake, containing the request to discharge a leaking container,"
"was sent only on 20.05.2021 at 10.19 a.m. It is obvious that this request"
"too  was  made 
on 
the 
directions 
received 
from 
the  Marine"
"Superintendent,  who  expected  his  Agent  to  “ensure”  that  the  leaking"
"container is discharged at Colombo."
"217. It is clearly evident from the material already referred to and considered"
"in the preceding paragraphs that Samaranayake was fully aware of the"
"requirement of discharging the leaking Container at least from 11.07 a.m."
"on  19.05.2021,  if  not  earlier.  Thus,  the  senior  management  of  the  local"
"Agent  of  the  Company,  although  acutely  aware  of  the  urgency  of  the"
"requirement  to discharge the  leaking container  in the Port of  Colombo"
