"270. This fact is referred to by Dr. Darren Holling, in his 2nd email sent on"
"20.05.2021 to Terence Goh (at 5.42 Singapore time) stating that “I note that"
"there is a container of lithium batteries on deck at slot 110482” by bringing it"
"to  the  notice  of  those  who  are  concerned  with  assessing  the  potential"
"danger  it  might  pose.  This  is  confirmed  by  the  crew  members,  who"
"entered Cargo Hold No. 2, after the smoke detectors altered them, and"
"saw that “… leak marks on some containers, as well as signs of melted metal,"
"…”  (vide  paragraph  1.1.8.22  of  the  Singapore  Report  at  p.28).  The"
"alarming observation of the incandescent glow on some of the containers"
"that were stowed in Cargo Hold No. 2, at the early hours of 20.05.2021,"
"was a sure sign that the situation was not normal at all. The melted metal"
"in Cargo Hold No. 2, coupled  with the observation  of an incandescent"
"glow, emitting from some of the containers, should have been treated by"
"all those involved with the decision making over the affairs of the vessel"
"as a red flag situation, which had a high probability of threatening the"
"safety of the crew, the vessel, as well as of the marine environment."
