"638. In this regard, he had further stated that:"
"“Hypothetically, even if I have allowed the XPP to berth,"
"the problem was no longer contained to just one container,"
"as the whole of the cargo hold no. 2 was full of smoke and"
"fumes,  and  the  fire  was  spreading.  It  is  far  more  difficult"
"(and dangerous) to manage a cargo hold fire than a single"
"container.  I  needed  to  be  absolutely  certain  that  the  Port"
"could rectify the problem onboard the XPP, and ensure the"
"protection  of  crew  and  port  personnel  first  and  foremost.”"
"(para 55 of Y1)"
