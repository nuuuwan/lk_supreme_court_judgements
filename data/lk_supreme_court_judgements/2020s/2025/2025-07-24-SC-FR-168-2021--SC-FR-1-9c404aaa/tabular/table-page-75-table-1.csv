"143. The Report further describes the sequence of events in a more detailed"
"manner.  Paragraphs  1.1.8.21  and  1.1.8.22  provide  valuable  insight  into"
"the  incident  of  reported  emission  of  smoke  without  “fire”.  These  two"
"paragraphs are reproduced below in verbatim:"
"“At about 1030H, during the CE’s routine inspection rounds of the E/R,"
"he  noticed  an  unusual  smell  of  burning  rubber.  Not  seeing  any"
"abnormalities inside the E/R, the C/E returned to the ECR and called"
"the A-2E to accompany him to find out the source of smell."
"The CE and the A-2E entered the starboard side passageway and traced"
"the smell to cargo hold 2. As both CE and the A-2E entered cargo hold"
"2, they saw space filled with smoke and several small fires at the top tiers"
"between rows 05/07 and 06/08. One of these small fires was around the"
"upper section door (along the rubber gasket) of one of the containers. In"
"addition, the A-2E also recalled leak marks on some containers, as well"
"as signs of melted metal.”"
