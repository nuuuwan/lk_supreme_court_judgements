"560. Mr. Pulle submitted that based on the evidence before this Court, it is"
"clearly evident that the Owner, Operator and the Agent of X-Press Pearl"
"through  their  rash,  negligent  and  deceitful  conduct  had  violated  the"
"Fundamental rights of the people of Sri Lanka by causing environmental"
"pollution. He submitted that it is well within the jurisdiction of this Court"
"to determine who the polluter is and to impose appropriate sanctions on"

"Article 4(d) of the Constitution."
"561. Mr. Pulle while appreciating the limitation of the jurisdiction vested in"
"the

regarding 
the  matters  pertaining 
to

"infringement of Fundamental rights, submitted that the requirement of"
"establishing 
that

"though the Petitioners are required to at the outset establish on a prima"
"facie 
footing 
that 
there  has 
been 
an 
infringement 
or 
imminent"
"infringement of a Fundamental right due to executive or administrative"
"action,  the  sanctions  and  directives  which  the  Supreme  Court  may"
"impose on Non-State actor Respondents need not be conditioned upon a"
"finding 
that 
there  has 
in 
fact  been  an 
infringement  or 
imminent"
"infringement 
of 
Fundamental 
rights 
due 
to 
an 
executive 
or"
"administrative action."
