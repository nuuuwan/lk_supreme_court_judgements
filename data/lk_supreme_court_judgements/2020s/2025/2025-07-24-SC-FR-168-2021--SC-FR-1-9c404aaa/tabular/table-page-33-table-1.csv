"they represent, the public at large and on behalf of the environment. They"
"also had  the objectives of ensuring  the delivery of justice and securing"
"meaningful  and  due  relief  and  redress  in  respect  of  the  severe  and"
"disastrous ecological and economic consequences suffered by the people"
"of this nation. On an examination of the evidence placed before this Court"
"and the submissions made by learned counsel, this Court entertains no"
"doubt regarding the bona fides of the several Petitioners and the several"
"parties who sought and obtained permission of Court to intervene. These"
"Applications were indeed in national and public interest."
