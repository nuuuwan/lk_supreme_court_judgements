"State actors, it ought to be noted that Article 27(14) of the Constitution of"
"Sri  Lanka  provides  that  “The  State  shall  protect,  preserve  and  improve  the"
"environment for the benefit of the community”. Thus, it is the Constitutional"
"duty of the State (which would include the judiciary) to protect, preserve"
"and 
improve 
the  environment.  Thus, 
the  Court  has

"appropriate  instances  to  make  orders  to  provide  for  the  protection,"
"preservation and the improvement of the environment, which includes"

"790. Further,  the  Fundamental  rights  jurisdiction  of  the  Supreme  Court,"
