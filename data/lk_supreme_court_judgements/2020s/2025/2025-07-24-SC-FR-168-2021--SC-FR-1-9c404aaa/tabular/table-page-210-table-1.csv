"viii.","Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, MP – The Insurance company of"
"","X-Press Pearl has filed an action in London seeking a declaration that"
"","the maximum amount the insurer was obliged to pay is Singapore"
"","Dollars 12.5 million (USD 26 million). Notwithstanding the fact that"
"","the GOSL has been cited as a party to that action, and the lapse of"
"","over one and a half years since the filing of that action, why has not"
"","the GOSL filed papers in that case? The local law firm representing"
"","the  party  that  has  filed  the  action 
in  London  has  notified  the"
"","Australian law firm retained by the GOSL regarding the case. Why"
"","is it that nothing was done in that regard, till this matter was raised"
"","in Parliament?"
"ix.","Hon.  Ajith  Mannaperuma,  MP  –  Referring  ostensibly 
to 
the"
"","limitation  of  liability  proceedings  in  London,  has  alleged  that  the"
"","Attorney  General’s  Department  had  not 
intervened 
in 
those"
"","proceedings in a timely manner."
"x.","Hon.  Dayasiri 
Jayasekera,  MP  –  The  GOSL  and 
the  Attorney"
"","General’s  Department  has  waited 
till 
the 
limitation  of 
liability"
"","proceedings  proceeded  ex-parte and a decision has been arrived at"
"","by that court. If successful, the Singapore based companies will have"
"","to pay only up to Sterling Pounds 19.5 million."
