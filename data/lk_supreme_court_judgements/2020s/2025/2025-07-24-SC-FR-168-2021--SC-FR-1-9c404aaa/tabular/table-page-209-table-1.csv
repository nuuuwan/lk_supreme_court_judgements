"Hon. Prof. Charitha  Herath, MP  â€“  Had  the case been filed  in a Sri"
"Lankan court, it would have been possible to secure the maximum"
"amount of compensation. The action filed in Singapore is subject to"
"the  limitation  of  liability proceedings  filed  in  a  London  court.  [He"
"has queried as to why a risk was taken by filing action in a foreign"
"court.]  Had  the  main  case  been  filed  in  a  Sri  Lankan  court  and  to"
"arbitrate the claim had Singapore been chosen as a forum, it would"
"have  been  understandable.  There  has  been  a  delay  in  filing  action"
"with regard to the disaster associated with the X-Press Pearl. There"
"is a need to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee to inquire into"
"this matter."
