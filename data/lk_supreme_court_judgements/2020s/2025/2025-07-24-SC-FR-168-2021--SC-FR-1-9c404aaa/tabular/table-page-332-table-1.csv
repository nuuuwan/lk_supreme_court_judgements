"USD 6.483 billion and the pleading of the Petitioner in SC FR 184/2021"
"that the actual loss suffered would amount to USD 9 billion and therefore"
"that full amount should be recovered, it is the view of this Court that the"
"polluter (MV X-Press Pearl group of companies who have been cited as"
"the  Non-State  party  Respondents  in  the  several  Applications)  must  be"
"required to jointly pay an initial (minimum) amount of compensation"
"as provided in this Judgment. Thereafter, as and when the actual amount"
"of compensation payable is computed, the polluter (referred to herein)"
"will  be  required  to  make  such  other  and  further  payments.  In  this"
"regard,  this  Court  notes  that, although  the  Petitioners  have  brought  to"
"this  Court  claims  of  compensation,  such  claims  seem  to  be  widely"
"disputed across the parties and therefore not definitive."
