"navigation, crew, passengers, or the environment are swiftly dealt with,"
"thus minimizing risks associated with maritime operations."
"773. Additionally, under Section 232, there is a mandatory duty for any ship"
"in distress to be reported to the DGMS, and in instances where casualties"
"occur  due  to  loss  of  life  or  significant  damage,  a  formal  investigation"
"must  be  conducted  by  the  DGMS  to  ascertain  the  causes  and  prevent"
"similar  incidents  in  the  future.  This  reflects  the  importance  placed  on"
"accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement in maritime"
"safety practices."
"774. In the case of the MV X-Press Pearl disaster, the DGMS’s actions must"
"be assessed against the above Statutory responsibilities."
"775. When  the  MV  X-Press  Pearl  entered  Sri  Lankan  waters  in  May  2021,"
"neither the DGMS nor any local authority was aware that the vessel was"
"carrying a leaking container of hazardous nitric acid. It was only on the"
"morning of 20 May 2021, after the ship had already arrived at Colombo’s"
"outer  harbour,  that  the  local  Agent  emailed  the  Harbour  Master  at"
"10:19 hours to report the acid leak. By that time, the ship was within port"
"limits  (having  anchored  at Colombo  at around  03:00 hrs  on  20th May)."
"The  DGMS  could  not  have 
invoked  Section 20  to  divert  the  vessel"
"beforehand, as no information about the vessel in distress was available"
"to any Sri Lankan authority upon its entry."
"776. Once the emergency became known, the Director General of Merchant"
"Shipping (DGMS) became part of the coordinated national response. A"
"Marine Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) was already established in"
"pursuant to Sri Lanka’s obligations under the SOLAS Convention, and"
"the DGMS had delegated operational control of marine search and rescue"
"to the Sri Lanka Navy. This arrangement enabled the Navy and the Sri"
"Lanka  Ports  Authority  (SLPA)  to  jointly  respond  as  events  unfolded,"
"including in respect of firefighting efforts."
