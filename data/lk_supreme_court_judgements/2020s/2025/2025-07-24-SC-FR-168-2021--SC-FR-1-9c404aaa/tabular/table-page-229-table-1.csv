"546. It remains not too clear to this Court as to why Dr. De Silva produced"
"this agreement and what he sought to achieve on behalf of his clients by"
"its production. Be that as it may, the existence of this agreement (which"
"was not previously disclosed to this Court by the Attorney General) gave"
"rise 
to  considerable  controversy  and 
the 
learned 
counsel 
for

"vested and conceded in the Singapore International Commercial Court"
"(SICC) constitutes a grave abdication of the Sri Lankan State’s sovereign"
"right  to  adjudicate  the  environmental  damage  that  occurred  within  its"

"severely restricts Sri Lanka’s capacity to assert its sovereign legal rights."

"counterclaims, rights of limitation of liability, and set-offs in favour of the"
"defendants,  while  offering  no  reciprocal  protections  to  the  Claimant"
"party (being the Government of Sri Lanka). Dr. Dabare argued that the"
"clauses  barred  the  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  from  seeking  redress  in  any"
"forum other than the SICC, the defendants retained the latitude to pursue"
"or  rely  upon  claims  or  proceedings  commenced  elsewhere,  thereby"
"granting them a strategic advantage of forum control, which he said was"
"inconsistent  with  principles  of  fairness  and  equality.  He  concluded  by"
"submitting  that  this  agreement  was  fundamentally  prejudicial  to  the"
