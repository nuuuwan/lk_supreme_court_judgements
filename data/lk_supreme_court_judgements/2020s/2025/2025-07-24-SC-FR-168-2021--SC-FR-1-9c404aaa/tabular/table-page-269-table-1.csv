"","specifically  noted  that  there  were  toxic  fumes  that  prevented  the  team"
"","from approaching and inspecting the affected area."
"","642. According to the Affidavit submitted by the Harbour Master, it is stated"
"that","the  boarding 
team 
returned  at  approximately  18:30  hrs.  and"
"","informed the Harbour Master that the situation on board was uncertain."
"","Relying on his expertise and the information relayed to him, the Harbour"
"Master  had  decided","to 
cancel 
the  berthing  permission 
that  had"
"previously been granted.",""
"","643. However,  learned  President’s  Counsel  who  represented  the  X-Press"
"","Pearl  group  contended  that  this  account  is  contradictory  and  further"
"","asserted  that,  according  to  the  Harbour  Master’s  Affidavit  dated  3rd"
"","September 2024, tug “Megha” returned to port at 19:50 hrs and “Pilot 14”"
"","returned  at  19:55  hrs.  It  was  also  alleged  that  the  Harbour  Master’s"
"","decision  was  made  without  any  factual  basis,  since  he  arrived  at  the"
"","decision prior to the return of the boarding team."
"","644. Nevertheless,  on  behalf  of  the  Harbour  Master  it  was  submitted  that"
"","continuous communication was maintained between the boarding team"
"and","the  Harbour  Master  via 
radio 
communication.  Accordingly,"
"","although the boats in which the boarding team travelled returned to the"
"","Port at a later time, adequate information had been conveyed in real time"
"","to the Harbour Master, enabling him to take a timely decision based upon"
"","the ground situation. Though there was an absence of visible flames, due"
"","to the presence of thick chemical smoke and toxic fumes on the deck and"
"inside  Cargo  Hold  2  and  due","to 
the  uncertainty  which  prevailed,"
"","understandably a full inspection could not be carried out by the boarding"
"","team. In accordance with his statutory powers under Section 84B of the"
"","Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act, the Harbour Master acted reasonably and"
"","within his mandate to protect the safety of the port, personnel, and the"
"marine environment.",""
