"804. Recently, in the case of Vedanta Limited v. State of Tamil Nadu [2024"
"INSC 175], the following was mentioned:"
"“While  these  aspects  have  undoubted  relevance,  the  Court  has  to  be"
"mindful  of  other  well-settled  principles  including  the  principles  of"
"sustainable  development,  the  polluter  pays  principle,  and  the  public"
"trust doctrine. The polluter pays principle, a widely accepted norm in"
"international and domestic environmental law, asserts that those who"
"pollute or degrade the environment should bear the costs of mitigation"
"and  restoration.  This  principle  serves  as  a  reminder  that  economic"
"activities should not come at the expense of environmental degradation"
"or the health of the population.”"
