"the  factual  and  technical  developments  on  the  ground.  The  absence  of"
"such  adaptation  during  a  period  of  clear  escalation 
is  a  failure  to"
"discharge the duties entrusted to the Authority."
"Liability of the Chairperson of MEPA"
"737. The former Chairperson of MEPA served as the statutory head of the"
"Authority during the relevant period and was responsible for directing"
"its response to the X-Press Pearl disaster. As the person presiding over a"
"multi-member  body  vested  with  powers  under  the  Marine  Pollution"
"Prevention Act, the Chairperson was expected to lead the Authority in"
"accordance with the institutional structure established by statute. Even"
"though  the  Covid-19  pandemic  which  prevailed  at  the  time  of  this"
"incident and the ensuing lockdown imposed to curtail the spread of the"
"pandemic 
is 
likely 
to  have 
served 
as 
an 
impediment 
towards"
"mobilisation  of  the  personnel  of  MEPA  and  its  functions,  this  Court  is"
"mindful that the Chairperson of MEPA had secured the opportunity of"
"visiting the Colombo Port and had also participated in the site inspection"
"visit to the vessel which took place in the evening of the 21st May 2021."
"Thus, it is the view of this Court that the prevalence of the pandemic does"
"not appear to have caused a significant obstacle towards the discharge of"
"the functions of the Chairperson of MEPA. Furthermore, what this Court"
"is  examining  is  not  her  operational  activities,  but  the  discharge  of  the"
"statutory 
functions 
imposed  on  MEPA  by 
the  Marine  Pollution"
"Prevention Act. This Court also notes that while it is evident that she was"
"proactive  in  issuing  directives,  the  question  before  this  Court  is  not"
"whether  she  issued  such  directives,  but  performed  her  duties  in  the"
"manner the law required."
"738. The statute confers decision-making power on the Authority as a body,"
"not on its chairperson acting alone. The composition of MEPA’s Board"
"includes  ex-officio  members  from  ministries  with  subject  expertise  in"
"environment, 
defence, 
finance, 
foreign 
affairs, 
fisheries, 
disaster"
"management, 
and 
coastal 
conservation.  These 
appointments 
are"
"deliberate,  and  they  reflect  a  legislative  understanding  that  decisions"
