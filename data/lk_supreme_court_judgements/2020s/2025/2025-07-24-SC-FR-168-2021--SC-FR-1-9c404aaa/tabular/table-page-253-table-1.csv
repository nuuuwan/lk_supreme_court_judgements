"or instructions detailing the procedures to be followed when reporting"
"incidents involving harmful substances."
"592. Under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (herein"
"after  referred  to  as  SOLAS),  Chapter  1,  Regulation  11,  addresses  the"
"ongoing  obligation 
to  maintain 
the  condition  of 
the  ship  and 
its"
"equipment following survey certification. This regulation stipulates that"
"a  ship  and  all  its  equipment  must  be  maintained  in  a  condition  that"
"ensures the vessel remains fit to proceed to sea without posing a danger"
"either  to itself  or  to persons  on  board.  Should  an  accident occur  to the"
"ship, or should any defect be discovered which affects the safety of the"
"vessel  or  the  efficiency  or  completeness  of  its  life-saving  appliances  or"
"other equipment, the Master or Owner of the ship is obliged to report the"
"matter at the earliest possible opportunity. Such reports must be made"
"either  to the  flag State  Administration,  the  nominated  surveyor,  or  the"
"recognised  organisation  responsible  for  issuing  the  relevant  statutory"
"certificates. An investigation shall then be initiated to determine whether"
"a further survey, as required by Regulations 7, 8, 9, or 10, is necessary."
"Should  the  incident  occur  in  a  port  under  the  jurisdiction  of  another"
"Contracting  Government,  the  Master  or  Owner  must  also  report  the"
"matter immediately to the appropriate authorities of the port State, and"
"the  nominated  surveyor  or  recognised  organisation  must  ensure  that"
"such notification has been duly made."
"593. Although  Regulation  11  of  Chapter  I  of  SOLAS  serves  as  a  general"
"safety  provision  and  does  not  expressly  refer  to  dangerous  goods  or"
"incidents  of  pollution,  a  significant 
leak  of  dangerous  cargo  could"
"nonetheless  fall  under  its  scope  if  it  poses  a  threat  to  the  safety  of  the"
"vessel  or  its  equipment,  for  instance,  through  fire  or  explosion  risks."
"Notably, Regulation 11 exists independently of Chapter V. Regulation 11"
"addresses mandatory reporting systems."
"594. Chapter  V  of  SOLAS  Regulation  11  explicitly  recognises  that  ship"
"reporting  systems  play  a  critical 
role 
in  safeguarding 
life  at  sea,"
