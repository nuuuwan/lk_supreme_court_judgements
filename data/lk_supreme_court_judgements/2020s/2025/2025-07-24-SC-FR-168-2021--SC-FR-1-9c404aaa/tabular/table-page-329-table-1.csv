"preparation of  substance  or  any  other  related  element  that  caused  the"
"harm must be held strictly liable for causing such harm as a part of the"
"social  cost 
for  carrying  on  the  hazardous  or inherently  dangerous"
"activity.  If  the  enterprise  is  permitted  to  carry  on  a  hazardous  or"
"inherently dangerous activity for its profit, the law must presume that"
"such  permission  is  conditional  on  the  enterprise absorbing  the  cost  of"
"any  accident  arising  on  account  of  such  hazardous  or 
inherently"
"dangerous  activity  as  an  appropriate 
item  of 
its  over-heads.  Such"
"hazardous  or  inherently  dangerous  activity  for  private  profit  can  be"
"tolerated  only  on  condition 
that 
the  enterprise  engaged 
in  such"
"hazardous  or  inherently  dangerous  activity  indemnifies  all  those  who"
"suffer  on  account  of  the  carrying  on  of  such  hazardous  or  inherently"
"dangerous activity regardless of whether it is carried on carefully or not."
"This principle is also sustainable on the ground that the enterprise alone"
"has the resources to discover and guard against hazards or dangers and"
"to provide warning against potential hazards."
