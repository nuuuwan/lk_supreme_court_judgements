"","739. In  her  Affidavit,  the  Chairperson  stated  that  “based  on  my  authority"
"","under the Marine Pollution Prevention Act (MPPA), and without waiting"
"for  external  advice,","I  had  previously 
issued 
two  directives”.  This"

"","740. As  discussed  in  the  preceding  analysis,  Section  24(3)  of  the  MPPA,"
"","allows  the  Authority  to  take  over  control  of  a  vessel  or  initiate  more"
"","drastic measures if earlier directives prove to be ineffective. That power"
"","can only be exercised if, in the opinion of the Authority, prior directives"
"","are  not  achieving  their  intended  result.  However,  there  is  no  evidence"
"","that the Authority met to consider this possibility. The Chairperson did"
"","not bring this matter before the Board, nor did she call for a reassessment"
"of the Authority’s approach, despite being able to do so.",""
"","741. The submission made by the Attorney General, that the Board ratified"
"her  actions","subsequently  does  not  cure 
this 
failure.  There 
is  no"
"","prohibition  against  ratification  under  the  statute.  However,  timing  in"
"","matters of this nature is important. The powers under Section 24(3) are"
"","designed to be used in response to a changing situation where prior steps"
"","are no longer adequate. The judgment required by law is one that must"
"","be made in real time. A subsequent ratification cannot replace a statutory"
"opinion that was never formed when it was necessary.",""
"","742. The  failure  to  activate  the  Board  also  deprived  the  Authority  of  the"
"benefit  of 
informed","institutional  deliberation.  The  urgency  of 
the"
"","situation  is  not  in  dispute;  decisions  made  during a  crisis  must still  be"
"","grounded in due process. In fact, the greater the potential consequences,"
"","the  more  important  it  is  that  such  decisions  are  carefully assessed  and"
"","lawfully authorized in keeping with the required statutory provisions."
