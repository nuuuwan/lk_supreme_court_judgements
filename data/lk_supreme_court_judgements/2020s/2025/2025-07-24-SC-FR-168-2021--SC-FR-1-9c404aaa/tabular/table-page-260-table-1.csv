"612. In  the  light  of  the  operating  obligations  under  the  above-mentioned"
"international instruments, it is clear to this Court that International Law"
"advocates a framework mandating the Master of the vessel to notify the"
"relevant  authorities  immediately  upon  discovering  any  deformity  that"
"compromises the safety of the vessel, its crew and the environment. In"
"this  regard  and  in  the  context  of  the  MV  X-Press  Pearl  vessel,  it  is"
"important  to  note  that  by  the  use  of  the  term  ‘relevant  authorities’  the"
"reference being made is to inter alia Sri Lanka’s competent authorities."
