"present an action in personam in the High Court of Sri Lanka to claim"
"compensation from all parties connected with the incident."
"(c) Other  than  the  fact  that  the  X-Press  Pearl  vessel’s  Owner  and"
"Operators are situated in Singapore, there are no grounds on which"
"a claim under the MPP Act can be sustained within the jurisdiction"
"of Singapore. This is mainly because the claim is not commercial, but"
"a statutory claim arising under and in terms of the provisions of the"
"MPP Act."
"(d) The jurisdiction of the SICC is limited to hear and try an action, if the"
"claim in the action is of an international and commercial nature, the"
"parties to the action have submitted to the SICC’s jurisdiction under"
"a written jurisdiction agreement, and the parties to the action do not"
"seek any relief in the form of or connected with a prerogative order."
"(e) As  Sri  Lanka’s  marine  environment  has  not  suffered  due  to  oil"
"pollution  (as  a  result  of  the  X-Press  Pearl  marine  disaster),  the"
"limitation of civil  liability set out in the  Civil Liability Convention"
"(which is tied to section 35 of the MPP Act) shall not apply."
"(f)  In all the circumstances of the marine disaster resulting from the X-"
"Press Pearl fire and the ensuing sinking of the vessel, the Committee"
"recommends that a claim under section 34 of the MPP Act together"
"with applicable international (treaty based) law be instituted against"
"all  parties  responsible  including  the  Owner,  Operators,  and  the"
"London  P&I  Club  in  the  High  Court  of  the  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka"
"(exercising Admiralty jurisdiction) as an action in personam. In such"
"circumstances, compensation can be claimed by the State under and"
"in terms of the MPP Act of Sri Lanka, even for violations under the"
"provisions  of  the  applicable  international  law  regime  [specifically"
"the provisions of the International Convention for the Prevention of"
"Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) – Annexures II and III]."
