"502. A consideration of the investigation reports submitted by the CID to the"
"learned  Magistrate  does  not  reveal  any  attempt  by  the  investigators"
"aimed at suppressing the investigation, or conducting such investigation"
"in  a  manner  detrimental  to  the  objectives  of  criminal  justice.  It  also"
"appeared to this Court that the CID had been appropriately advised by"
"the Attorney General and his officers regarding the manner in which a"
"complicated  investigation  in  the  nature  of  what  had  been  conducted"
"should be carried out. Court notes that none of the learned counsel who"
"represented the Petitioners criticised the manner in which both criminal"
"and forensic investigations had been carried out."
