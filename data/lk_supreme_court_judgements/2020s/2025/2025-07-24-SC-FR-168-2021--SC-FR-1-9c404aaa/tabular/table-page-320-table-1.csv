"Principle  2  of  the  U.N.  Rio  De  Janeiro  Declaration  (1992).  Rational"
"planning  constitutes  an  essential  tool 
for  reconciling  any  conflict"
"between the needs of development and the need to protect and improve"
"the environment. (Principle 14, Stockholm Declaration). Human beings"
"are  at  the  centre  of  concerns  for  sustainable  development.  They  are"
"entitled  to  a  healthy  and  productive  life  in  harmony  with  nature."
"(Principle 1, Rio De Janeiro Declaration). In order to achieve sustainable"
"development, environmental protection shall constitute an integral part"
"of the development process and cannot be considered in isolation from"
"it. 
(Principle  4,  Rio  De 
Janeiro  Declaration).  In  my  view,  the"
"proposed  agreement  must  be  considered 
in  the 
light  of  the"
"foregoing  principles.  Admittedly,  the  principles  set  out  in  the"
"Stockholm  and  Rio  De  Janeiro  Declarations  are  not  legally"
"binding in the way in which an Act of our Parliament would be."
"It may be. It may be regarded merely as ‘soft law’. Nevertheless,"
"as a Member of the United Nations, they could hardly be ignored"
"by Sri Lanka. Moreover, they would, in my view, be binding if they"
"have been either expressly enacted…”"
