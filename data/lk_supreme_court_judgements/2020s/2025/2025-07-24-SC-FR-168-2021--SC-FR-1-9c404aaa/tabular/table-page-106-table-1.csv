"importance  of  discharging  the  container  that  posed  a  risk  to  keep  it"
"onboard the vessel with the addition of the word “ensure”, leaving them"
"with no other choice."
"224. With the emphasis placed on the failure on the part of the local Agent"
"to  make 
the  application 
to  discharge 
the 
leaking  container 
in  an"
"expeditious manner, given the importance attached to it with the words"
"“very risky to keep it onboard”, a question would arise in the mind of the"
"reader, on how a timely request would have prevented the fire on board."
"There is no direct answer that could be provided in a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’"
"format.  In  this  complex  equation,  all  the  relevant  factors  have  to  be"
"considered  as  variables.  However,  that  question  could  be  answered  in"
"this manner. If there was a timely request made with a full disclosure of"
"relevant 
information, 
there  would  have  been  many  other  options"
"available to the Port Control, which it could have considered before time"
"ran out, than the ones it had considered and implemented."
"225. The following considerations would certainly confirm that proposition."
"It is noted that the local Agent knew the necessity to discharge the leaking"

"20.05.2021  at  10.19  a.m.  In  the  request  made  to  the  Harbour  Master,"
"Samaranayake conveyed that they have been advised by the  Master of"
"MV X-Press  Pearl,  that one  of  the  containers  FSCU  7712264  containing"
"DG (Nitric acid) has been leaking onboard and requested permission to"
"discharge the same at Colombo for re-working. The only other additional"
"information that was conveyed by him was the Master informing them"
"that there is smoke for the last few days but no fire, and the  Container"
"stowage is at position 110582."
"226. This request could not be criticised for its content, provided that it was"
"made  in  the  ordinary circumstances,  as  it concerns  only an  incident  of"
"leakage of a corrosive substance from a container, which emitted fumes"
"for  the  past  few  days.  The  wording  used 
in  the  request  gives  the"
"impression to its recipient that the Agent was only seeking permission of"
