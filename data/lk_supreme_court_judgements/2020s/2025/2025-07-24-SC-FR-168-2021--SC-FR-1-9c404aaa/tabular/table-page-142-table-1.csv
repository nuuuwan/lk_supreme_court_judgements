"not  materialise,  despite  the  necessary  approvals  being  granted  by  the"
"port administration  in time. The Harbour Master urgently needed that"
"inspection  report  to  plan  out  his  strategy  for  the  management  of  the"
"dangerous situation. The surveyor, for some undisclosed reason, never"
"boarded the vessel and hence there was no report. During the hearing of"
"these  applications  and  when  this  Court  sought  a  clarification  as  to  the"
"reason for the surveyor not boarding the vessel and making a report, the"
"President’s  Counsel’s  response  was  that  he  had  no  reason  to  offer  to"
"explain that conduct on the part of the local Agent."
