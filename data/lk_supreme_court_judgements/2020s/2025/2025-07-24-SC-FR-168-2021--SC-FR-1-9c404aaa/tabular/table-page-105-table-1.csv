"WhatsApp stating that “tomorrow we will know what if we can solve all the"
"issues as CMB, the ministry in CMB is closed”."
"221. The claim that the Harbour Master’s office being closed is a deliberate"
"falsehood  on  the  part  of  the  local  Agent,  probably  concocted  with  the"
"intention to buy time and for the purpose of covering up for their lapses."
"The statutory Declaration of Dangerous goods was sent at 4.46 p.m., on"
"19.05.2021 by Lunugama through electronic mail. That declaration was"
"acknowledged  and  accepted  by  the  Navigation  Safety  Section  of  the"
"Harbour Master’s office. The acknowledgement was by way of sending"
"a reply email at 8.08 p.m. in the same evening. The reply that was sent is"
"clearly not a system generated automatic reply. The reply made a specific"
"reference in the middle of the body of its text to the name of the vessel,"
"as “M.V. X-PRESS PEARL”."
"222. The  primary  mode  of  communication  between  the  Harbour  Master’s"
"office and Sea Consortium Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. was through electronic mail."
"Lunugama  made 
the  Declaration  of  Dangerous  Cargo  via  email."
"Similarly,  Samaranayake  also  made 
the 
request 
to  discharge 
the"
"Container  through  an  email  sent  at  10.19  a.m.  on  20.05.2021.  It  is  an"
"absurd  proposition 
to 
claim 
that  while 
communicating 
through"
"electronic mail, it is not possible to contact the Harbour Master, unless"
"the recipient’s office is kept open. The local Agent need not wait until the"
"following morning to communicate his request, which was sent through"
"electronic mail. The local Agent should have sent that request no sooner"
"than he received the specific instructions issued by its principal. It was"
"for the Port Control to respond in the first available opportunity, which"
"it did in the same evening."
"223. Even  on  20.05.2021,  the  email  was  sent  not  as  the  ‘first  thing  in  the"
"morning’ but only after almost two hours into the working day (at 10.19"
"a.m.), but without adducing a reason for the delay on its part.  This was"
"the  conduct  on  the  part  of  the  local  Agent,  especially  when  specific"
"instructions were issued by the Marine Superintendent after stressing the"
"SC/FR 168, 176, 184 & 277/2021 – “MV X-PRESS PEARL MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION CASE” - JUDGMENT
