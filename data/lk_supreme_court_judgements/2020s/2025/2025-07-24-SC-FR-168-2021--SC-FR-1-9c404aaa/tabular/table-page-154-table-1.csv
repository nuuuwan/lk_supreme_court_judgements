"360. Thus, 
in  view  of  the  considerations  adverted  to 
in  the  preceding"
"paragraphs, it is reasonable to conclude that the local Agent’s assertion"
"that they were informed of the situation onboard the vessel only on the"
"evening of 19.05.2021 could not be accepted as a truthful statement made"
"with the intention of bona fide disclosure of the narrative."
"361. The references being made to the handling of the situation on board the"
"vessel Seaspan Lahore and the comparison made with the situation of X-"
"Press  Pearl  were  necessitated  when  the  local  Agent,  in  support  of  its"
"contention that discharging the leaking container would have solved all"
"of the problems, relied on a newspaper report annexed to the Affidavit"
"of Ravi Muttusamy dated 18.11.2024, marked as “X6” with the heading “"
"SLPA successfully mitigates nitric acid leak on ship”  with the averment that"
"“  …  even  after  the  X-Press  Pearl  incident,  the  Port  of  Colombo  successfully"
"discharged and reworked a leaking nitric acid container  that was aboard the MV"
"Seaspan Lahore.”"
"362. It must be emphasised here that the purpose of making a comparison of"
"the  two  situations  was  not  because,  if  there  was  timely  disclosure,  the"
"vessel X-Press Pearl could have been saved from its inevitable doom, but"
"to impress upon the manner in which a vessel, when encountered with a"
"similar  situation,  could  have  acted  bona  fide  and  disclosed  the  relevant"
"and vital information to the Port Control well before its planned arrival,"
"allowing  the  port  administration 
to  arrive  at  a  well 
informed  and"
"considered decision. When compared with the information presented to"
"respective  Port  Controls  of  Hamad,  Hazira  and  Singapore  and  the"
"duration of the time those ports had to make an informed decision on the"
"request  to  discharge  the 
leaking  container,  a  clear  disparity 
in  the"
"disclosure  of 
information  to  Colombo  Port  Control  could  easily  be"
"identified."
"363. In  this  context,  it  must  not  be  misunderstood  that  the  findings  made"
"over  the  delay  or  failure  to  make  the  request  for  the  discharge  of  the"
"leaking  container  is  the  basis  on  which  the  liability  that  should  be"
