"the consequences which are  and  will have an effect on the citizenry of"
"this nation and the generations to come."
"481. Whilst 
the  damage  caused 
to 
the  environment  has  still  not  been"
"computed and quantified in Rupees and Cents and Sri Lanka has still not"
"been  compensated 
for  such 
loss,  certain  steps  have  been 
taken 
to"
"compensate the fisheries sector."
"482. The learned ASG informed the Court that in the aftermath of the X-Press"
"Pearl  disaster,  notices  were  published  in  the  newspapers  and  through"
"ground level fisheries societies, inviting the affected fishing community"
"of the X-Press Pearl disaster to submit claims for the losses suffered (vide"
"Affidavit  of 
the  Secretary 
to 
the  Ministry  of  Fisheries 
(“Secretary,"
"Fisheries”), the 5th Respondent in SC/FR 176/2021)."
"483. Accordingly,  the  learned  ASG  contended  that  claims  were  received"
"from 15,032 fishermen who had been directly affected owing to the losses"
"of income and 4888 indirectly affected persons, who also suffered losses"
"due  to  fisheries  related  activities,  which  totalled  up  to  19,920  claims."
"These  claims  were  then  vetted  and  referred  to  a  cabinet  appointed"
"compensation committee, where a single value for both directly affected"
"and indirectly affected fishing communities was arrived at. The claims"
"were  then  submitted  to  the  Director  General  of  the  Department  of"
"Fisheries  and  Aquatic  Resources  (7th  Respondent  in  SC/FR  168/2021),"
"who tendered the said 19,920 claims to the London P&I Club, the liability"
"insurer  of  the  owner  and  the  Operators  of  the  MV  X-Press  Pearl,  for"
"payment."
"484. The  London  P&I  Club,  independently  assessed  the  fisheries  claims,"
"through  a  London  based  Fisheries  Consultancy  Firm  MRAG,  which"
"conducted their own verification process by visiting Sri Lanka and made"
"the following payments, as partial settlement of the fisheries claims:"
