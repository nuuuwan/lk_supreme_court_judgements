"industry, if by reason of an accident occurring in such industry, persons"
"die or are injured. Does the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher apply or is there"
"any other principle on which the liability can be determined? The rule"
"in Rylands v. Fletcher was evolved in the year 1866 and it provides that"
"a person who for his own purposes being on to his land and collects and"
"keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes must keep it at his"
"peril and, if he fails to do so, he is prima facie liable for the damage which"
"is the natural consequence of its escape. The liability under this rule"
"is strict and it is no defence that the thing escaped without that"
"person's  wilful  act,  default  or  neglect  or  even  that  he  had  no"
"knowledge of its existence. â€¦"
