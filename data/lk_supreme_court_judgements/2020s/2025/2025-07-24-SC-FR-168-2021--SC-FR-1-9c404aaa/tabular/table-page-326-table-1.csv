"The application of Rylands v. Fletcher is in situations where there"
"is a dangerous substance brought into the land, the bringing of"
"such  substance  is  a  non-natural  use  of  the  land,  and  that  the"
"escape  of  the  dangerous  substance  must  cause  damage  to  the"
"neighbouring land."
