"Role of International Tanker Owners’ Pollution Federation"
"758. The  material  placed  before  this  Court  indicates  that  the  International"
"Tanker  Owners  Pollution  Federation 
(ITOPF)  was  engaged 
in 
the"
"response  to  the  MV  X-Press  Pearl 
incident  at  an  early  stage.  This"
"engagement  appears  to  have  been  initiated  by  both  the  Sri  Lankan"
"authorities and the vessel Owners. According to the Affidavit of the then"
"Chairperson of MEPA, ITOPF’s involvement was prompted by an official"
"of  the  International  Maritime  Organization  (IMO), 
in  response  to  a"
"request  for  technical  assistance  made  during  the  MT  New  Diamond"
"incident.  Pursuant 
to 
this  advice,  MEPA  sought  and  obtained 
the"
"requisite  approval  of  His  Excellency  the  President  on  26th  May  2021"
"(document  marked 
6R-7(b)).  Thereafter,

"759. The  evidence  tendered  on  behalf  of  the  shipowner  indicates  that  the"
"Owners, acting through Killiney Shipping, proceeded to formally engage"
"ITOPF as part of their emergency response initiative. In his Affidavit, Lim"
"Kin Seng affirms that this decision was taken upon the guidance of the"
"vessel’s insurer, the London P&I Club, and that in addition to ITOPF, Oil"
"Spill  Response  Limited  (OSRL)  was  similarly  engaged.  The  Owners"
"specifically  describe  ITOPF  as  a  non-profit  organization  possessing"
"recognized expertise in responding to oil and chemical spills in marine"
"environments."
"760. It  is  further  evident  that  ITOPF  undertook  a  range  of  technical  and"
"coordination tasks in support of the incident response. According to the"
"Affidavit of the MEPA Chairperson, ITOPF’s technical competence was"
"utilized  for 
the  purposes  of  oil  spill 
trajectory  modelling  and  risk"
"assessment. She avers that Environmental Sensitivity Index (ESI) maps"
"of the coastline were transmitted to Mr. Campion of ITOPF to facilitate"
