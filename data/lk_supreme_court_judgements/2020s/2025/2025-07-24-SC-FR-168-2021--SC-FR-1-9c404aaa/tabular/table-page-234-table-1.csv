"agencies  and 
the 
relevant  Officials  such  as  his  client.  He 
further"
"submitted  that  based  on  the  evidence  presented  by  his  client  and  his"
"submissions, should this Court hold that there was no action or inaction"
"by his client that can be identified as being ‘arbitrary’, then there cannot"
"be  any  declaration 
that  a  Fundamental 
right  had  been 
infringed."
"However, notwithstanding the Court holding that there was no fault on"
"the  part  of 
the  State  or  by  any  agency  of 
the  State  and 
thus  no"
"infringement of Fundamental rights, still relief can be granted against the"
"perpetrator for a wrong which may result in a violation of a Fundamental"
"right. Learned President’s Counsel submitted that Article 126(4) is a sui"
"generis provision, and the said Article can be made use of to grant relief"
"against a private party. He emphasised that Article 126(4) empowers the"
"Supreme  Court  to grant relief  or  make  such  directions  as  it  may deem"
"just and equitable in certain circumstances where wrongful action which"
"constitutes  an  infringement  of  a  Fundamental  right has  taken  place  by"
"even  a  Non-State  party.  What he  said  is  based  on  the  principle  that, if"
"there is a right, there should be a remedy. Learned President’s Counsel"
"concluded his submissions by stating that the Supreme Court is vested"
"with  jurisdiction  to  award  relief  as  it  deems  fit  to  the  victims,  while"
"holding  the  guilty  parties  liable  for  their  wrongdoing.  To  do  so,  he"
"submitted  that  it  would  not  be  necessary  to  ‘blame’  the  State  or  State"
"agencies."
