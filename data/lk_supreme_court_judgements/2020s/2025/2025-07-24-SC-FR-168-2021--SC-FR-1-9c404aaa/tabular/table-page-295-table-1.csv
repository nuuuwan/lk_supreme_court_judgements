"in  this  case,  where  time  is  of  the  essence  and  indecision  may  result  in"
"irreversible harm."
"728. On a consideration of the material before Court, there is no indication"
"that  the  Authority  considered  invoking  its  power  under  Section  24(3),"
"despite its assessment that the ship posed a serious and ongoing threat"
"to the marine environment. No explanation has been provided to suggest"
"that the Authority assessed the effectiveness of its directions in light of"
"the  vessel’s  deteriorating  condition  or  that  it  considered  invoking  the"
"powers expressly granted for that eventuality."
"729. During submissions, it was also stated that had the Authority directed"
"a  single  course  of  action  and  had  such  an  operation  resulted  in  an"
"explosion or any adverse outcome, the shipowner might have relied on"
"that directive as a basis to absolve themselves of liability. For this reason,"
"it was argued that the burden of selecting the appropriate course of action"
"was left to the discretion of the shipowner."
"730. This Court is of the view that such an approach cannot be accepted as a"
"justification  for  the  failure  to  make  firm  decisions  where  the  statute"

"regulatory  authority 
in  the  context  of  an  environmental  emergency"
"should  prioritize  public  safety  and  environmental  protection.  They"
"cannot abdicate their Statutory mandate based on what a polluter may"
"later argue in its defense."

"the object and purpose of the statute."
"732. Section 24(2) contemplates that directions issued by the Authority will"
"be  specific  and  as  an  administrative  decision,  such  directives  are"
"expected  to  be  clear,  enforceable,  and  proportionate  to  the  seriousness"
"and urgency of the situation. The discretion conferred by the Statute must"
