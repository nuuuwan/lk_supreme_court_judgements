"Vessel, the Shippers and the respective terminal operations. Unlike the"
"team  of 
investigators  for  the  TSIB,  he  has  had  no  opportunity  for"
"personally  interviewing  any  of  the  stakeholders  and  considering  the"
"evidence available as to the effects the leaking acid had on the vessel."
"167. But the regular situational reporting of the leaking of Nitric acid and its"
"effect on the hatch covers of the vessel, undertaken by the Master reveals"
"a more serious situation on board than a mere situation where there is a"
"“very  small  leak”  which  the  crew  on-board  could  manage  as  the  expert"
"opined."
"168. The  Master’s  act  of  describing  the  seriousness  of  the  situation  in  his"
"email reporting the leak of Nitric acid to Juned Saleem of Transvision Sea"
"Shipping  Lines  Agents  LLC,  sent  on  11.05.2021  at  9.12  a.m.,  indicating"
"that 
the  Acid  had  heavily 
corroded 
the  hatch 
cover,  has  been"
"downplayed  by  the  container  ship  expert  when  he  stated  that  the"
"Master’s concerns about the leak were related to the damage to the hatch"
"covers,  paint  and  deck  “rather  than  the  risk  of  fire”.  This  opinion  might"
"have its validity confined only to the exact moment of detection of the"
"acid leak, and certainly not to the circumstances in which the vessel was,"
"when she reached Port of Colombo. In his opinion (paragraph 5 – ii), “the"
"vessel’s hatch covers appear of a design which would prevent the spillage of cargo"
"from  the  Container  directly  into  the  cargo  hold  and  any  spillage  would  be"
"expected to be drained onto the main deck of the vessel, from where it could be"
"flushed  overboard”.  This  could  well  be  the  general  situation  in  similar"
"vessels.  But 
the  Singapore  Report  contains  a  finding  made  by 
the"
"investigators that reflects another area of concern not adverted to by the"
"container ship expert, despite him having perused the said report. The"
"Singapore Report states (paragraphs 1.4.4.1 and 1.4.4.2 at p. 52) that “The"
"cargo holds were fitted with non-weather tight hatch cover panels typical for a"
"ship of this design” and “These panels had gaps of about 30 +/- 10 mm between"
"the fore-aft gutter plates …”."
