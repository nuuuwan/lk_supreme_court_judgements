"811. In the case of Wijebandara v. Conservator-General of Forests [(2009) 1"
"SLR 337 at page 362], the following has been said:"
"“… While the polluter pays principle internalizes the costs of pollution"
"to 
corporate 
or 
individual 
polluters, 
the 
principle 
of 
public"
"accountability  extends  this  liability  towards  corrupt  or  incompetent"
"regulators for the most egregious instances of mis-regulation.”"
"812. In 
the  case  of  Ravindra  Gunawardena  Kariyawasam  v.  Central"
"Environment Authority and Others [SC FR Application No. 141/2015 S.C."
"Minutes of 4th April 2019], this Court has observed as follows:"
"“It is an oft-cited and applied principle of environmental law that the"
"“Polluter Pays”. This is reflected in Principle 16 of the Rio Declaration,"
"which  states  “National  authorities  should  endeavour  to  promote  the"
"internalization 
of 
environmental 
costs 
and 
the  use  of 
economic"
"instruments, taking into account the approach that the polluter should,"
"in  principle,  bear  the  cost  of  pollution,  with  due  regard  to  the  public"
"interest and without distorting international trade and investment.”"
"[…]"
"This  is  an  appropriate  case  to  apply  the  “Polluter  Pays”  principle.  I"
"direct the 8th respondent to pay compensation in a sum of Rs. 20 million"
"to offset at least a part of the substantial loss, harm and damage caused"
"to  the  residents  of  the  Chunnakam  area  by  the  contamination  of"
"groundwater in the Chunnakam area and of soil in the vicinity of the"
"8th 
respondent’s 
thermal  power 
station.  Article  126 
(4)  of 
the"
"Constitution vests ample jurisdiction in this Court to make the aforesaid"
"Order, which is just and equitable in the circumstances of this case.”"
