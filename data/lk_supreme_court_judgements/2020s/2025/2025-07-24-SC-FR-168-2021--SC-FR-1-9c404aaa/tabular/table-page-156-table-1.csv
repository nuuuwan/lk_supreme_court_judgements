"this Court could consider its validity in the backdrop of the said factual"
"narrative."
"Conclusions regarding segment two"
"366. The obvious indecision of the Marine Superintendent, over determining"
"the port at which the leaking container was to be discharged, could be"
"cited  here  as  a  prime  example.  That  long  period  of  indecisiveness  had"
"incurred the cost of a vessel to her Operators, and effectively denied an"
"opportunity  for  the  Colombo  Port  Control,  to  manage  the  situation"
"onboard  the  vessel,  in  the  most  effective  manner,  perhaps  even  saving"
"the vessel from its doom."
"367. The threat posed by the continuous leakage of Nitric acid into the Cargo"
"Hold  No.  2,  to 
the  crew,  the  cargo,  the  vessel  and  to  the  marine"
"environment,  was  unfortunately 
totally 
ignored  or  at 
least  overtly"
"trivialised by the decision makers by placing the commercial interests of"
"the Company as their foremost consideration. When  the Company ran"
"out  of  any  other  option  to  discharge  the  leaking  container,  it  made  an"
"attempt  to  do  so  at  Colombo,  not  by  making  a  full  disclosure  of  the"
"situation  but  by  wilful  suppression  of  vital  information  from  the  port"
"administration,  whom  it  feared  might  prevent  the  vessel  to  enter  the"
"territorial waters, if the true situation is disclosed well in advance."
"368. It  is  unavoidable  in  these  circumstances  to  inquire  into  whether  the"
"Master  as  well  as 
the  Marine  Superintendent  have  had  any  prior"
"experience  in  handling  similar  situations  that  arose  in  their  respective"
"careers."
"369. The  Master  of 
the  vessel  X-Press  Pearl  Captain  Tyutkalo  Vitaly,"
"commenced his shipping career as an officer cadet in 1994 and had been"
"promoted  to  the  rank  of  Master  Marina  in  the  year  2005.  He  held  a"
"Master's  Licence,  along  with  Licenses  for  Communication  (Distress)"
"issued in the year 2017. He joined as the Master of the vessel X-Press Pearl"
"in April 2021. On his own admission, the Master had no prior experience"
