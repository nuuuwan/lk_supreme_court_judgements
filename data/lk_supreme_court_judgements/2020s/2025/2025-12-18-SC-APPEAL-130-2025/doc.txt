Argued on: 01.10.2025

Decided on: 18.12.2025

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs instituted this action against the defendant in the District

Court of Kandy in 2012, seeking a declaration of title to the land described

in the schedule to the plaint, the ejectment of the defendant therefrom, and

damages. The defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the action and

made a cross-claim for compensation for improvements.

The case was fixed for trial on 13.10.2015. On that date, in the presence of

both parties and their respective Attorneys-at-Law, admissions and issues

were recorded. The first admission recorded was that the defendant had

been residing in the premises with the leave and licence of the plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs raised issues seeking the ejectment of the defendant on the

basis of the termination of leave and licence. The defendant had virtually

no defence, although some issues were raised. The case was thereafter fixed

for further trial on 23.02.2016.

On 23.02.2016, in the presence of both parties and their Attorneys-at-Law,

a settlement was recorded in open court. The settlement was to enter the

decree in favour of the plaintiffs for declaration of title and ejectment of the

defendant, except for damages; and the defendant to vacate the premises

on 31.12.2016. According to the proceedings, the terms of settlement were

explained to both parties in open court, and both parties signed the case

record signifying their agreement to the settlement.

SC/APPEAL/130/2025

Four months after the aforesaid settlement, the defendant, having revoked

the previous proxy, retained a new Attorney-at-Law and moved court to set

aside the settlement and refix the case for further trial. His position was

that he intended to obtain a sum of Rs. 500,000 as compensation for

improvements, but this had not been recorded as a term of settlement. The

District Judge rejected this application by order dated 07.06.2017.

The defendant, in my view with the intention of delaying the proceedings,

filed a final appeal rather than seeking leave to appeal, against the said

order to the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kandy. The High Court dismissed

the appeal by judgment dated 11.12.2020.

One year and six months after the judgment of the High Court, the

defendant filed an application for restitutio in integrum in the Court of

Appeal in May 2022, seeking to set aside the settlement entered in the

District Court on 23.02.2016, more than six years ago. A single Judge of

the Court of Appeal allowed that application and set aside the settlement,

mainly on the basis that it had not been entered in compliance with section

408 read with section 91 of the Civil Procedure Code, in that the settlement

had not been notified to court by way of a motion.

Section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

If an action be adjusted wholly or part by any lawful agreement or

compromise, or if the defendant satisfy the plaintiff in respect to the

whole or any part of the matter of the action, such agreement,

compromise, or satisfaction shall be notified to the court by motion

made in presence of, or on notice to, all the parties concerned, and the

court shall pass a decree in accordance therewith, so far as it relates

to the action, and such decree shall be final, so far as relates to so

much of the subject-matter of the action as is dealt with by the

agreement, compromise, or satisfaction.

4

SC/APPEAL/130/2025

Section 91 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

Every application made to the court in the course of an action,

incidental thereto, and not a step in the regular procedure, shall be

made by motion by the applicant in person or his counsel or registered

attorney, and a memorandum in writing of such motion shall be at the

same time delivered to the court.

According to section 408, where an action is to be adjusted by a

compromise, such compromise shall be notified to court by motion made in

the presence of or on notice to the parties, and the court shall thereupon

enter decree in accordance with the terms of settlement. This, however, does

not mean that a compromise not notified by motion is invalid or

unenforceable, if the substance of what is required to be done by motion is

done before the Judge in open court. A statutory provision must be

interpreted contextually, giving effect to its purpose and spirit. Section 91

merely identifies the type of applications that shall be made by motion in

the course of an action, and it has no bearing on the recording of

settlements.

It is well known to Judges and practitioners of the original civil courts that

the overwhelming majority of settlements are recorded in open court in the

presence of the parties and their respective Attorneys-at-Law. In most

instances, the parties themselves sign the case record signifying their

consent to the settlement. This long-standing practice constitutes the

cursus curiae of our District Courts. Cursus curiae est lex curiae—the

practice of the Court is the law of the Court.1

1 In Sri Lanka Ports Authority v. JugoliniJa Boal East [1981] 1 Sri LR 18 at 24, Chief Justice Samarakoon stated “If no objection is taken when at the close of a case documents are read in evidence they are evidence for all purposes of the law. This is the cursus curiae of the original Civil Courts.”

SC/APPEAL/130/2025

Where a settlement is recorded in open court by the District Judge, in the

presence of the parties and their Attorneys-at-Law, and the parties sign the

record signifying their consent to its terms, such settlement is final and

binding. It constitutes a contract entered into among the parties, and once

so entered, a party cannot thereafter resile from it merely because he later

forms the view that the settlement is unfavourable to him. The only

recognised grounds upon which such a settlement may be set aside are

those applicable to the rescission of a contract, namely illegality, fraud,

mistake, misrepresentation, coercion, undue influence, or other similar

vitiating factors. Such instances are rare.

A settlement so recorded cannot be set aside on the sole ground that it was

not notified to court by motion in the manner contemplated by section 408

of the Civil Procedure Code. Nor can it be vitiated as a matter of course on

the basis that a party was not physically present when the settlement was

recorded or that he did not sign the case record, provided his Attorney-at-

Law acted on his instructions or had the general authority to act in the best

interests of his client. Nevertheless, where a settlement is entered in open

court, it is prudent to record the terms in the presence of the parties and to

obtain their signatures on the record signifying their consent.

It is also relevant to observe that, where a party has a registered Attorney

on record, such party cannot enter into a settlement independently of his

Attorney-at-Law. Any such act shall be done through the Attorney-at-Law.

In Sinna Veloo v. Messrs Lipton Ltd (1963) 66 NLR 214, the defendant-

appellant sought to resile from a settlement on the ground, inter alia, that

it had been entered without his consent and notified to court in his absence.

The Supreme Court held that the presence of parties in section 408 does

not require their personal presence, as parties are represented by their

Attorney-at-Law unless personal appearance is expressly mandated. Once

the agreed terms are presented to court, notified thereto, and recorded, a

6

SC/APPEAL/130/2025

party cannot thereafter resile from the settlement, even if the case record

has not been signed and decree has not yet been entered.

In Lameer v. Senaratne [1995] 2 Sri LR 13, it was held that where an

Attorney-at-Law has been given a general authority to settle a case, the

client cannot thereafter seek to set aside the settlement so entered,

particularly where the client himself has signed the record.

As Sarker’s The Law of Civil Procedure, Vol 2, 8th Edition 1992, at page 1203

states “Non-inclusion of the clause that in the event of non-performance of

conditions, the party concerned is entitled to for execution does not render

decree inexecutable. The executing court can enforce such a condition.”

On the facts and circumstances of this case, the defendant has failed to

establish any ground that would vitiate the settlement. He has, in my view,

abused the process of court in order to remain in the premises for as long

as possible. I set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and allow the

appeal with costs. The defendant shall vacate the premises on or before

30.02.2025. If he fails to do so, the plaintiff shall be entitled to have writ

executed forthwith to eject the defendant and all those holding under him.
