"1.","This matter arises pursuant to a letter dated  09/01/2008  addressed to"
"","the  Honourable  Chief  Justice  by  Major  W.  W.  M.  L.  S.  Palipana"
"","(hereinafter referred to as the Complainant), requesting an inquiry into"
"","the conduct of Mr. Wasantha Wijewardane, Attorney-at-Law (hereinafter"
"","referred to as the Respondent), in relation to a professional retainer."
"2.","The Complainant, by letter dated 27/02/2008, along with his  Affidavit"
"","and other documents, alleged that the Respondent was retained to take"
"","necessary legal steps to implement the decisions of the Supreme Court"
"","dated  01/03/2006  and  15/02/2007  in  SC  (FR)  68/2006.  An  advance"
"","payment of Rs. 50,000 was made on 09/11/2007, being half of the agreed"
"","fee  of  Rs.  100,000.  However,  due  to  repeated  inaction  and  evasive"
"","conduct by the Respondent, the Complainant on 05/12/2007, requested"
"","the Respondent that the matter need not be pursued further and sought"
"","the return of his documents and fees."
"3.","Following further correspondence and a meeting in mid-December 2007,"
"","the Complainant was handed a draft Petition which he deemed untimely"
"","and  ineffective.  He  subsequently  returned  the  draft  and  reiterated  his"
"","request for a refund via letter dated 20/12/2007. The Respondent failed"
"","to  respond  or  refund  the  fees,  prompting  the  Complainant  to  allege"
"","professional misconduct and unjust enrichment."
"4.","In pursuance of the said complaint, and in accordance with the Journal"
"","Entry dated 05/03/2008, this Court directed that observations be called"
"","from the Respondent. The Respondent, by observations tendered on or"
"","about 30/05/2008, admitted having been retained by the Complainant"
"","and  acknowledged 
the 
receipt  of  professional 
fees.  However, 
the"
"","Respondent  sought  to  justify  his  conduct  by  reference  to  the  proposed"
"","legal strategy, certain fee adjustments, and the alleged involvement of Mr."
"","Chula Bandara, Attorney-at-Law."
