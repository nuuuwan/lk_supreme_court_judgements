"5.","The  Respondent  expressly  denied  the  existence  of  any  professional"
"","arrangement  with  Mr.  Bandara  and 
further  asserted  that  the  draft"
"","petition  prepared  by  him  was 
legally  viable,  notwithstanding 
the"
"","Complainant’s dissatisfaction or concerns expressed thereon."
"6.  The matter was thereafter referred to Disciplinary Committee No. 5 of the",""
"","Bar  Association  of  Sri  Lanka, 
in  terms  of  the  Journal  Entry  dated"
"","08/07/2008.  Pursuant 
thereto,  by 
letter  dated  26/08/2008, 
the"
"","Registrar requested the said Committee to conduct a preliminary inquiry"
"","under Section 43(1) of the Judicature Act, and to submit its proceedings"
"","together with a report to this Court within a period of three months."
"7.","At  the  said  inquiry,  the  Respondent  initially  conceded  to  refund  the"
"","monies received from the Complainant; however, the actual payment was"
"","unduly  delayed.  Owing  to  repeated absence and  postponements  on the"
"","part of the Respondent, the refund was ultimately affected only in July,"
"","2009. Notwithstanding such payment, the matter concerning  the three"
"","case  files,  which  remained  unreturned  by  the  Respondent,  continued"
"","unresolved."
"8.  Upon  conclusion  of  its  proceedings,  the  Disciplinary  Committee,  by",""
"","recommendation  dated  01/02/2014, 
submitted 
its 
findings 
to 
the"
"","Honourable  Chief  Justice  to 
initiate  appropriate  disciplinary  action"
"","against the Respondent. The Disciplinary Committee concluded that the"
"","Respondent has “not performed his professional obligations towards his"
"","client  in  a  diligent  manner  and  has  been  negligent  in  misplacing  his"
"","client’s  documents  handed  over  to  him  which  has  resulted  in  grave"
"","inconvenience, prejudice and loss to the Complainant in not being able"
"","to obtain the redress that he was seeking to obtain before a court of law.”"
"9.  Careful  consideration  of  the  material  placed  by  the  Complainant,  the",""
"","Respondent, 
and 
the  Disciplinary  Committee,  disclosed 
that 
the"
"","Respondent’s 
conduct  was  disgraceful,  dishonourable, 
and  wholly"
