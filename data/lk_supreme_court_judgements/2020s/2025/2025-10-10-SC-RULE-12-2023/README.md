A. L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

1. This matter arises pursuant to a letter dated 09/01/2008 addressed to

the Honourable Chief Justice by Major W. W. M. L. S. Palipana

(hereinafter referred to as the Complainant), requesting an inquiry into

the conduct of Mr. Wasantha Wijewardane, Attorney-at-Law (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent), in relation to a professional retainer.

2. The Complainant, by letter dated 27/02/2008, along with his Affidavit

and other documents, alleged that the Respondent was retained to take

necessary legal steps to implement the decisions of the Supreme Court

dated 01/03/2006 and 15/02/2007 in SC (FR) 68/2006. An advance

payment of Rs. 50,000 was made on 09/11/2007, being half of the agreed

fee of Rs. 100,000. However, due to repeated inaction and evasive

conduct by the Respondent, the Complainant on 05/12/2007, requested

the Respondent that the matter need not be pursued further and sought

the return of his documents and fees.

3. Following further correspondence and a meeting in mid-December 2007,

the Complainant was handed a draft Petition which he deemed untimely

and ineffective. He subsequently returned the draft and reiterated his

request for a refund via letter dated 20/12/2007. The Respondent failed

to respond or refund the fees, prompting the Complainant to allege

professional misconduct and unjust enrichment. 4. In pursuance of the said complaint, and in accordance with the Journal

Entry dated 05/03/2008, this Court directed that observations be called

from the Respondent. The Respondent, by observations tendered on or

about 30/05/2008, admitted having been retained by the Complainant

and acknowledged the receipt of professional fees. However, the

Respondent sought to justify his conduct by reference to the proposed

legal strategy, certain fee adjustments, and the alleged involvement of Mr.

Chula Bandara, Attorney-at-Law.

Page 3 of 10

5. The Respondent expressly denied the existence of any professional

arrangement with Mr. Bandara and further asserted that the draft

petition prepared by him was legally viable, notwithstanding the

Complainant’s dissatisfaction or concerns expressed thereon.

6. The matter was thereafter referred to Disciplinary Committee No. 5 of the

Bar Association of Sri Lanka, in terms of the Journal Entry dated

08/07/2008. Pursuant thereto, by letter dated 26/08/2008, the

Registrar requested the said Committee to conduct a preliminary inquiry

under Section 43(1) of the Judicature Act, and to submit its proceedings

together with a report to this Court within a period of three months.

7. At the said inquiry, the Respondent initially conceded to refund the

monies received from the Complainant; however, the actual payment was

unduly delayed. Owing to repeated absence and postponements on the

part of the Respondent, the refund was ultimately affected only in July,

2009. Notwithstanding such payment, the matter concerning the three

case files, which remained unreturned by the Respondent, continued

unresolved.

8. Upon conclusion of its proceedings, the Disciplinary Committee, by

recommendation dated 01/02/2014, submitted its findings to the

Honourable Chief Justice to initiate appropriate disciplinary action

against the Respondent. The Disciplinary Committee concluded that the

Respondent has “not performed his professional obligations towards his

client in a diligent manner and has been negligent in misplacing his

client’s documents handed over to him which has resulted in grave

inconvenience, prejudice and loss to the Complainant in not being able

to obtain the redress that he was seeking to obtain before a court of law.”

9. Careful consideration of the material placed by the Complainant, the

Respondent, and the Disciplinary Committee, disclosed that the

Respondent’s conduct was disgraceful, dishonourable, and wholly

Page 4 of 10

unbecoming of an Attorney-at-Law. The Respondent’s actions amounted

to deceit, malpractice, crime or offence, and conducted himself in a

manner unworthy of an Attorney-at-Law. He conducted himself in a

manner which is inexcusable and such as to be regarded as deplorable by

his fellows in the profession, and which would reasonably be regarded as

disgraceful or dishonourable of Attorneys-at-Law of good repute and

competence. Therefore, the Honourable Chief Justice was of the view that

proceedings be instituted against the Respondent in terms of Section

42(2) of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978, read with Part VII of the

Supreme Court Rules of 1978 made under Article 136 of the Constitution.

10. Thereupon, as directed by the Honourable Chief Justice, a Rule was

caused to be drafted by the Honourable Attorney General. The said Rule

disclosed, inter alia, that the Respondent had conducted himself

negligently and without due diligence, thereby acting in breach of Rules

10, 15, 16, 18, 18(a), 60, and 61 of the Supreme Court (Conduct and

Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law) Rules of 1988, promulgated under

Article 136 of the Constitution.

11. Accordingly, in the matter of a Rule in terms of Section 42(2) of the

Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 instituted against the Respondent, this

Court, having taken cognizance of the procedural and the factual

circumstances surrounding the conduct of the Respondent, proceeds to

make the following observations.

12. Section 42(2) of the Judicature Act reads thus;

42. (2) Every person admitted and enrolled as an attorney-at-law

who shall be guilty of any deceit, malpractice, crime or offence may

be suspended from practice or removed from office by any three

Judges of the Supreme Court sitting together.

Page 5 of 10

13. Rule 79(1) and 79(2) of the Supreme Court Rules states thus;

79. (1) Where the Supreme Court decides that proceedings for the

suspension or removal of an Attorney-at-Law should be taken, the

Court shall issue a Rule containing the charge or charges against the

said Attorney-at-Law and call upon him to show cause, within a

period of three weeks or such further time as the Court may deem fit,

why he should not be suspended or removed from office.

(2) Such Rule shall be served personally on the Attorney-at-Law

concerned, and in the event personal service cannot be effected, the

Court may direct substituted service as it may deem fit.

14. Section 42(3) of the Judicature Act similarly provides that prior to any

suspension or removal of an Attorney-at-Law, a notice containing a copy

of the charge or charges against him, and calling upon him to show cause

within a reasonable time shall be personally served on him, and where

such service cannot be affected, the Supreme Court shall order

substituted service.

15. Rule 80(1) provides as follows;

80. (1) If, on the day appointed for showing cause, the respondent

does not appear or appears and states that he has no cause to show,

the Supreme Court shall make such order in the Rule as it thinks fit.

16. On the direction of this Court, Notices were issued through the Fiscal of

the District Court of Kandy at three given addresses of the Respondent,

as reflected in the Journal Entry dated 22/05/2024;

a. No. 33/4, Riverdale Road, Aniwatta, Kandy.

b. No. 03, Colombo Street, Kandy.

c. No. 44/13/C, Dammadassi Mawatha, Kandy.

Page 6 of 10

17. It is evident from the Fiscal Report dated 07/06/2024 that the Notices

were duly served on the Respondent at No. 44/13/C, Dammadassi

Mawatha, Kandy, as reported to this Court. Despite the personal service

of the Rule, the Respondent has continued to remain absent and

unrepresented, and has failed to show cause against the charges. In the

circumstances, this Court deems fit to proceed with this matter and make

an appropriate determination.

18. The evidence adduced against the Respondent, as contained in the

documents of record, the findings of the Disciplinary Committee, and

the affidavit filed by the Complainant in these proceedings, remains

uncontroverted.

19. This Court further observes that the Respondent had previously been

suspended from practice for a period of seven years in proceedings

instituted under SC/Rule/08/2014, decided on 25/09/2020, which

arose from matters of similar misconduct. In that instance, the

Respondent was found to be in breach of Rules 10, 15, 16, 60, 61, and 62

of the Supreme Court (Conduct and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law)

Rules of 1988.

20. The Supreme Court (Conduct and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law) Rules

of 1988 serve not as mere guidelines but as binding ethical obligations.

Rules 10, 15, 16, 18, and 18(a) impose a duty of care, competence, and

fidelity to clients, while Rules 60 and 61 enshrine the moral compass by

which the profession must be guided. A breach of these Rules,

particularly where it involves deceit, malpractice, or a failure to uphold

fiduciary duties, strikes at the very heart of public confidence in the fair

and proper dispensation of justice.

21. The Respondent’s conduct, as established by the findings of the

Disciplinary Committee and the affidavit evidence of the Complainant,

demonstrates negligence and dishonour wholly incompatible with the

Page 7 of 10

dignity and responsibilities of the legal profession. This recurrence of

misconduct discloses a continuing pattern of professional delinquency,

underscoring the Respondent’s inability or unwillingness to conform to

the standards expected of an Attorney-at-Law. Such conduct cannot be

condoned or overlooked.

22. This Court is compelled to reaffirm that the practice of law is not a

privilege to be exploited for personal gain, but a solemn calling which

demands accountability, transparency, and ethical fortitude. Where an

Attorney-at-Law fails to adhere to these standards, disciplinary sanction

is not only justified but essential to preserve the integrity of the

profession and to maintain public confidence in the administration of

justice.

23. It is imperative to note that, pursuant to Section 40 of the Judicature

Act No. 2 of 1978, this Court admits and enrols as Attorneys-at-Law only

those persons who are of impeccable character and who possess

demonstrable competence in legal knowledge and professional aptitude.

Upon enrolment, such Attorneys-at-Law are vested with the statutory

authority to advise and represent clients, and to appear, plead, and act

before any Court or other legally constituted forum entrusted with the

administration of justice.

24. Accordingly, members of the public are entitled to entertain the

reasonable expectation that Attorneys-at-Law whom they retain will

discharge their professional duties with integrity, diligence, and fidelity.

It can never be within the contemplation of such clients that their legal

representatives would engage in conduct amounting to deception,

breach of trust, or any act undermining the confidence reposed in them.

25. In terms of Section 42 of the Judicature Act, this Court is vested with the

solemn responsibility of upholding and enforcing the professional

standards attendant to the legal profession. In determining the

Page 8 of 10

appropriate course of action in matters of this nature, the Court is duty-

bound to consider the legitimate interests and expectations of the public,

the imperative of preserving the integrity and efficacy of the

administration of justice, and the necessity of maintaining the ethical

and professional standards incumbent upon members of the legal

fraternity.

26. The legal profession is not merely a vocation; it is a solemn public trust.

As Justice A. R. B. Amerasinghe in “Professional Ethics and

Responsibilities of Lawyers”, aptly states, “The lawyer is expected to be

a person of integrity and probity, and to conduct himself in a manner

that inspires confidence in the legal system”1, that “A lawyer must not

only avoid impropriety but must also avoid the appearance of

impropriety”2. This expectation is not aspirational; it is foundational.

The conduct of an Attorney-at-Law must reflect the dignity of the office

and the gravity of the responsibilities entrusted to it.

27. In cases where an Attorney-at-Law has acted in a manner that is

disgraceful or dishonourable, Justice Amerasinghe affirms that “The

removal of a lawyer from the Roll is not a punishment; it is a necessary

act to preserve the sanctity of the profession”3. The Supreme Court, in

exercising its disciplinary jurisdiction under Section 42(2) of the

Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978, must therefore act not only to censure the

individual but also to safeguard the collective integrity of the Bar.

28. The Respondent’s conduct, as found by the Disciplinary Committee,

constitutes a breach not only of specific rules, but of the very ethos of the

profession. The failure to act with diligence and honesty, particularly in

fiduciary matters, is not a mere lapse, it is a betrayal of the professional

oath.

1 A. R. B. Amerasinghe, Professional Ethics and Responsibilities of Lawyers (1993 Stamford Lake), p3 2 ibid, p 12 3 ibid, p 601

Page 9 of 10

29. The Respondent’s conduct, which amounted to deceit and malpractice,

has eroded the confidence that clients and the public are entitled to place

in Attorneys-at-Law. Such conduct is “inexcusable and deplorable”4 and

must be met with the full force of disciplinary sanction.

30. In SC Rule No. 05/20225, this Court observed that the Respondent’s

failure to file proper pleadings and maintain accurate records of client

funds deemed “gross ineptitude and negligence”, underscoring the

imperative that Attorneys must act with scrupulous care and due

diligence.

31. In Dhammika Chandratileke v. Susantha Mahes Moonesinghe,

cited in SC Rule No. 04/20246, and in SC Rule No. 05/20227, this Court

held that “An attorney whose misconduct is criminal in character…

may be struck off the roll… even though he had not been brought…

before a court of competent criminal jurisdiction and convicted.

32. Having considered the entirety of the circumstances outlined above,

including the Respondent’s previous suspension from practice for a

period of seven years in proceedings instituted under SC/Rule/08/2014,

his repeated absence from Court proceedings, his lack of remorse, and

his failure to take meaningful steps to mitigate the harm caused, thereby

demonstrating a blatant disregard for the standards expected of an

Attorney-at-Law, this Court is satisfied that the Respondent has engaged

in acts of deceit and professional misconduct. The Respondent has thus

conducted himself in a manner that is reprehensible and wholly

incompatible with the dignity of the legal profession.

33. In light of the seriousness of the misconduct established against the

Respondent, together with the aggravating factors previously discussed,

this Court is satisfied that the Rule must be affirmed. Accordingly, the

4 ibid, p 598 5 SC Rule No. 05/2022, SC minutes of 03/09/2024 6 SC Rule No. 04/2024, SC minutes of 24/07/2024 7 n5

Page 10 of 10

Respondent is forthwith removed from the Roll of Attorneys-at-Law in

terms of Section 42(2) of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978.

34. The Registrar of the Supreme Court is directed to take necessary steps to

ensure that this ruling is duly enforced and communicated to all relevant

authorities.

35. Rule affirmed. The Respondent is disenrolled from the Roll of Attorneys-

at-Law.
