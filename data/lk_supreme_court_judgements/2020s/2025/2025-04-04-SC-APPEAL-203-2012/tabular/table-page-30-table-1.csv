"(6) Where an appeal is made against a closing order, and such appeal"
"is  dismissed  or  is  abandoned,  the  appellant  shall  be  liable  to  a  fine"
"not exceeding twenty rupees a day during the non-compliance with"
"the order, unless he satisfies the court before which proceedings are"
"taken for imposing the fine that there was substantial ground for the"
"appeal, and that the appeal was not brought merely for the purpose"
"of delay; and where the appeal is heard the Court of Appeal may, on"
"dismissing the appeal, impose the fine as if it were the court before"
"which the summons was returnable."
