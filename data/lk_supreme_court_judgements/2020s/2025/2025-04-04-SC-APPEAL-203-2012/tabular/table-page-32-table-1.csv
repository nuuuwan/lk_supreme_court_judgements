"I  am  of  the  view  that  the  learned  Judge  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  the"
"Western Province holden in Panadura was not correct when it was ordered that"
"an inquiry should be held as to the party who came before the Court as claimants"
"subsequent  to  the  closing  order  as  there  was  no  provision  as  such  in  the"
"Ordinance.  I  find  that  this  order  has  been  made  despite  recognizing  that  the"
