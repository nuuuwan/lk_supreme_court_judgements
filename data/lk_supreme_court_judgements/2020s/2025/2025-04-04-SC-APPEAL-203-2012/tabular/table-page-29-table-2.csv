"and  Town  Improvement  Ordinance,  I  find  it  pertinent  to  reproduce  the  said"
"section in its totality for the better understanding of the judgment."
"77.  (1)  If  on  the  representation  of  the  health  officer  of  the  local"
"authority  or  other  information  given  any  dwelling  house  used  for"
"human  habitation  appears  to  the  Chairman  to  be  unfit  for  human"
"habitation, it shall be his duty to apply to the Magistrate to make a"
"mandatory  order  prohibiting  the  use  for  human  habitation  of  such"
"dwelling  house  (herein  referred  to  as  a  “closing  order”)  until  such"
"dwelling house is rendered fit for that purpose; and the Magistrate,"
"upon serving a notice upon the owner of such dwelling house, shall"
"have power to make such order accordingly."
"(2) Where a closing order has been made, the Chairman shall affix in"
"a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling house a notice calling upon"
"one  or  more  tenants  occupying  such  dwelling  house  to  quit  the"
"premises  on  or  before  the  expiration  of  the  calendar  month  next"
"succeeding the date of the notice."
"(3)  A  closing  order  shall  become  operative,  notwithstanding  any"
"appeal  that  may  be  entered  against  it,  from  the  expiration  of  the"
"period fixed by such notice, or if the premises in question are earlier"
"vacated, from the date when they are so vacated, or if the premises"
"are vacant at the date when the order is made, from the date of the"
"order."
"(4) If the Chairman is satisfied that the dwelling house in respect of"
"which any closing order has been made is or has been rendered fit for"
"human  habitation,  he  may  by  certificate  under  his  hand  authorize"
"such dwelling house to be used for human habitation."
"(5)  If  on  the  application  of  any  owner  of  a  dwelling  house  the"
"Chairman refuses to grant such a certificate, the owner may apply to"
"the Magistrate to determine the closing order."
