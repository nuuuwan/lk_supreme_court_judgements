The 4th, 6th, 8th claimant-petitioner-respondent- appellants as well as the 7b and

9a substituted claimant-petitioner-respondent-appellants (hereinafter

commonly referred to as the appellants) filed the amended petition dated 25-06-

2012 seeking to challenge the judgment pronounced by the Court of Appeal on

09-03-2012, in case No. CA(PHC) 22/95.

Page 23 of 34

From the impugned judgment, the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment

pronounced on 02-02-1995 by the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

holden in Panadura in Revision Application No. H.C.R.A. 19/94, and affirmed

the order made by the learned Magistrate of Panadura in Magistrates Court of

Panadura Case No. 17780 on 07-07-1994.

When this matter was supported for granting of leave, this Court, having

considered the matters contained in the petition, granted leave to appeal on the

following questions of law as stated in paragraph 22 (i), (j), (k) of the amended

petition.

The said questions of law read as follows,

(i) Did the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal misdirect themselves and

err in law in failing to consider the fact that the closing order issued in this

case affected the rights of the petitioners and caused severe injury to them.

(j) Did the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal misdirect themselves and

err in law in failing to consider the ground of collusion which amounted to

abuse of legal process.

(k) Did the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal misdirect themselves and

err in law in failing to consider that the application of the applicant should

be dismissed in view of the omission to make the necessary parties, namely

the occupants, respondents, parties to the said application.

Accordingly, when this appeal was taken up for hearing, this Court heard the

submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the appellants, as

well as the learned Counsel for substituted respondent-respondent-appellant-

respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the respondents) who were

substituted in this case in place of the now deceased original owner of the

dwelling house subjected to the closing order made by the learned Magistrate of

Panadura, and the respondent named in the case instituted before the

Page 24 of 34

Magistrate Court. For matters of clarity, hereinafter she will be referred to as the

owner respondent in this judgment.

The facts which led to the appeal preferred before the Court of Appeal can be

summarized in the following manner.

The Chairman of the Panadura Urban Council had issued a notice to the owner

respondent, informing her to take steps to demolish the building situated in

Rankoth Vihara Road (7th Cross Street), Panadura, which has several

assessment numbers, on the basis that the Work Superintendent of the Urban

Council and Panadura Medical Officer of Health (MOH) have reported to him that

the said building is in dilapidated and beyond repair condition, and therefore,

not fit for human habitation.

Subsequent to this notice, the Chairman of the Panadura Urban Council has

made an application before the Magistrates Court of Panadura by way of a

petition supported by an affidavit and several attachments to substantiate his

position. This application has been made in terms of section 77 and 78 of House

and Town Improvement Ordinance No. 19 of 1915 as amended.

In the said application before the Magistrates Court, the Chairman of the Urban

Council has informed the Court that the dwellings with assessment numbers 3,

1/3, 7, 9, 15, 15A, 17, 17A, 19 and 21 are situated in one building with a

common roof, and it had been reported to him by the Work Superintendent of

the Urban Council, as well as the Panadura Medical Officer of Health (MOH) that

the said dwellings are unfit for human habitation and also in a state where it

cannot be repaired, and therefore is in a dangerous state which may cause

danger to the public.

Along with the petition and the affidavit, he has tendered the observations of the

Work Superintendent of the Urban Council as well as that of the MOH to the

Court.

Page 25 of 34

He has named the owner of the building as the respondent in the application

filed and had sought an order from the Court against the owner respondent in

terms of section 77 of the Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance.

When this application was supported in open Court on 12-05-1993 with notice

to the owner respondent, the learned Judge before whom the application was

supported has issued a closing order, ordering the closure of the dwellings

mentioned in paragraph 02 of the application before the Magistrates Court. The

paragraph 02 consists of the earlier mentioned assessment numbers for which

the closing order was sought.

However, after the said closing order was issued, on 16-07-1993, the learned

Additional Magistrate of Panadura, having considered an application made by

the appellants as well as several others on the same basis as that of the

appellants, had vacated the earlier made closing order on the basis that he gave

that closing order only in relation to premises No. 1/1, Sinha Garage, 7th Cross

Street, Panadura, but upon inspecting the case record, he has now found that

another schedule has been attached to the case record including several

business premises, and therefore, his previous order does not relate to the said

other premises.

He has also decided to hold an inquiry and has ordered that notice be issued to

the Chairman of the Panadura Urban Council and the competent officer as well

as the owner of the building and other parties.

The 2nd order made by the learned Additional Magistrate of Panadura on 16-07-

1993 denotes that the closing order issued on 12-05-1993 have been issued by

the learned Additional Magistrate of Panadura. However, the copy of the said

closing order, which is available at page 198 of the appeal brief, suggests that

the said order dated 13-05-1993 has been in fact signed by the learned

Magistrate of Panadura.

It also needs to be noted that although the learned Additional Magistrate has

stated in his subsequent order where the previous closing order was set aside,

Page 26 of 34

that he made the order only in relation to premises No. 1/1, Sinha Garage, 7th

Cross Street, Panadura, there is no such number mentioned in the closing order.

The premises numbers mentioned in the closing order are the premises numbers

mentioned in the application before the Magistrates Court of Panadura by the

Chairman of the Urban Council of Panadura. Even in the said application, there

is no such number as mentioned by the learned Additional Magistrate to justify

his order to vacate the previous closing order.

It is with regret that I need to mention that the address used by the learned

Additional Magistrate to vacate the previous closing order was the address of the

owner of the dwelling house subjected to the closing order, and not the subject

matter of the closing order, as wrongly viewed by the learned Additional

Magistrate.

When this matter was brought to the notice of learned Magistrate of Panadura

on 07-07-1994, the learned Magistrate of Panadura, having heard the applicant

before the Magistrates Court, as well as the owner respondent, and also the

appellants and the other respondents who came before the Court as claimants,

has decided that there was no basis for the learned Additional Magistrate to

vacate the previous closing order made by the Court. Having considered the

relevant provisions of the Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance, the

learned Magistrate has determined that the order to temporarily vacate the

closing order, as well as allowing the appellants and the other claimants to

oppose the application of the Chairman of Panadura Urban Council, are orders

made due to a mistake of facts. Accordingly, the learned Magistrate has decided

to restore the closing order dated 12-05-1993.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellants and the other claimants before

the Magistrates Court has filed an application in revision before the High Court

of the Western Province holden in Panadura seeking to invoke the discretionary

remedy of revision granted to the said High Court in terms of Article 154P of The

Constitution.

Page 27 of 34

Having considered the application, the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Panadura has allowed

the revision application preferred by the appellants along with several other

claimants.

The learned High Court Judge has ordered the quashing of the order made by

the learned Magistrate on 07-07-1994, which in effect has restored the order

made by the learned Additional Magistrate temporarily setting aside the closing

order. It has been ordered that a fresh inquiry should be held.

It appears from the above judgment that the order made by the learned

Magistrate on 07-07-1994 has been set aside on the basis that the learned

Magistrate has no jurisdiction to set aside an order made by the learned

Additional Magistrate of Panadura on 16-06-1993, irrespective of whether it has

been decided rightly or wrongly, or being misled as to the facts.

It is against this judgment the owner respondent has preferred an appeal to the

Court of Appeal, seeking to challenge the determination of the learned Provincial

High Court Judge of the Western Province holden in Panadura.

After having considered the matters urged before the Court of Appeal, of the

judgment dated 09-03-2012, their lordships of the Court of Appeal, after

considering the legality of the order made by the learned Magistrate of Panadura

and also having considered several judicial decisions in that regard, has decided

that the learned Magistrate was correct in his order dated 07-07-1994. It has

been held that the learned Magistrate is empowered to correct an obvious

mistake by the Court, although it may be a mistake made by the Additional

Magistrate of Panadura.

Therefore, the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High

Court of the Western Province holden in Panadura pronounced on 02-02-1995

has been set aside, which in effect has restored the order made by the learned

Magistrate of Panadura on 07-07-1994.

Page 28 of 34

At the hearing of the appeal, it was the contention of the learned Presidents

Counsel on behalf of the appellants that there was no basis for the Court of

Appeal to set aside the judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province holden in Panadura, as it was a judgment pronounced

according to the law. It was his view that the subsequent order made by the

learned Additional Magistrate where the previous closing order made on 12-05-

1993 was vacated, was not an order made per incuriam. He also relied on the

judgment of the Court of Appeal in Titus Goonathilaka, Chairman of the Urban

Council Panadura Vs. Samaraweerakankaanamge Premasena in Court of

Appeal Case No.467/77 decided on 02-02-1979, to argue that the High Court

was justified in ordering an inquiry into the matter.

He also submitted that the closing order has been made without giving due notice

to the appellants, who are the tenants of the affected premises, and without

giving them any opportunity to show cause as to why the closing order should

not be made. It was also submitted that this is an action by the chairman of the

Urban Council in collusion with the owner of the premises, who was the

respondent named in the application made to the Magistrates Court. Under the

circumstances, it was his view that the appeal should be allowed and the learned

Magistrate of Panadura should be ordered to hold an inquiry before allowing the

application for a closing order.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the respondents that the

learned Additional Magistrate was totally misdirected as to the relevant law when

it was decided to vacate the previously made closing order and also allowing the

so-called claimants before the Court to show cause in this matter. Citing the

relevant section 77 of the Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance, it was his

submission that an order made under this section should be a mandatory order,

and the relevant procedural aspects after the closing order has also been clearly

provided in the said section itself. It was his view that the learned Magistrate,

who was the Judge who had in fact signed the closing order as the Magistrate of

Panadura, was correct in his order dated 07-07-1994, which was an order in

Page 29 of 34

accordance with the provisions of section 77 and other related sections of the

Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance.

Since this appeal revolves totally on the provisions of section 77 of the Housing

and Town Improvement Ordinance, I find it pertinent to reproduce the said

section in its totality for the better understanding of the judgment.

77. (1) If on the representation of the health officer of the local authority or other information given any dwelling house used for human habitation appears to the Chairman to be unfit for human habitation, it shall be his duty to apply to the Magistrate to make a mandatory order prohibiting the use for human habitation of such dwelling house (herein referred to as a closing order) until such dwelling house is rendered fit for that purpose; and the Magistrate, upon serving a notice upon the owner of such dwelling house, shall have power to make such order accordingly.

(2) Where a closing order has been made, the Chairman shall affix in a conspicuous place in or on the dwelling house a notice calling upon one or more tenants occupying such dwelling house to quit the premises on or before the expiration of the calendar month next succeeding the date of the notice.

(3) A closing order shall become operative, notwithstanding any appeal that may be entered against it, from the expiration of the period fixed by such notice, or if the premises in question are earlier vacated, from the date when they are so vacated, or if the premises are vacant at the date when the order is made, from the date of the order.

(4) If the Chairman is satisfied that the dwelling house in respect of which any closing order has been made is or has been rendered fit for human habitation, he may by certificate under his hand authorize such dwelling house to be used for human habitation.

(5) If on the application of any owner of a dwelling house the Chairman refuses to grant such a certificate, the owner may apply to the Magistrate to determine the closing order.

(6) Where an appeal is made against a closing order, and such appeal is dismissed or is abandoned, the appellant shall be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty rupees a day during the non-compliance with the order, unless he satisfies the court before which proceedings are taken for imposing the fine that there was substantial ground for the appeal, and that the appeal was not brought merely for the purpose of delay; and where the appeal is heard the Court of Appeal may, on dismissing the appeal, impose the fine as if it were the court before which the summons was returnable.

When considering the provisions of section 77 along with the application made

to the Magistrates Court of Panadura by the Chairman of the Urban Council, it

is manifestly clear that the Chairman has made the said application after

following due process. He has considered the documentary submissions made

to him by the MOH of the Council and also the Work Superintendent in relation

to the condition of the dwelling, which has several partitions with separate

assessment numbers.

The owner of the dwelling house has been duly notified requiring her to demolish

the said dwellings as it had been determined that those dwellings are not

habitable or in reparable condition.

It was after the said notice, the Chairman has made this application to the

Magistrates Court. In the said application supported by an affidavit, the separate

assessment numbers of the dwelling in question have been informed to the Court

along with the purpose for which the said premises has been used. Therefore,

there was no basis under any circumstances for the learned Additional

Magistrate to hold that he made the initial closing order only with regard to

premises No. 1/1, Sinha Garage, 7th Cross Street, Panadura, which was in fact

the address of the owner of the dwelling house, which was a separate premises

from the premises for which the closing order was requested.

Once a proper application is made to a Magistrates Court as in this case with

sufficient proof, it is the duty of the Magistrate of such Court to issue a

mandatory closing order prohibiting the use of such dwelling house for human

Page 31 of 34

habitation. It is only after such an order is made, the Chairman of the Urban

Council is required to affix the closing order in a conspicuous place in or on the

dwelling house calling upon one or more tenants occupying such dwelling house

to quit the premises within a month of the said notice. This shows that there is

nothing in the Ordinance which requires the Chairman to notify anyone other

than the owner of the dwelling before seeking an order from the Magistrate for a

mandatory closing order.

It is also clear from the provisions of the section that the purpose of obtaining a

closing order from a competent Court is not for the purpose of removing any

occupants of the dwelling house or to demolish it, but to see whether it is possible

to bring back the dwelling house to a habitable condition, where whatever the

trade or occupation carried out in such a place can be continued once the place

is brought back to such a condition, if possible.

The section also provides that the owner of the dwelling house can make an

appeal to the Chairman to the effect that the dwelling house has been restored

to a habitable position, and the Chairman has the power to issue a certificate

under his hand authorizing such a dwelling house to be used for human

habitation. If in a situation where the Chairman refuses to issue such a

certificate when applied, the owner has a right to apply to the Magistrate who

made the closing order to determine in that regard.

In my view, it is the point upon which a Magistrate can decide to hold an inquiry

as to the validity of the closing order previously made. I am unable to find any

provision where a party other than the owner of the dwelling house subjected to

the closing order can make an application to the Magistrates Court or for a

Magistrate to order an owner or any other claimant for that matter to show cause

as to why a closing order should not be made as determined by the learned

Additional Magistrate when he vacated the previous closing order made by the

Court.

Page 32 of 34

I am of the view that the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province holden in Panadura was not correct when it was ordered that

an inquiry should be held as to the party who came before the Court as claimants

subsequent to the closing order as there was no provision as such in the

Ordinance. I find that this order has been made despite recognizing that the

learned Additional Magistrate has gone on a completely wrong footing as to the

facts and law when making his second order.

I find no relevance in the judgment cited by the learned Presidents Counsel on

behalf of the appellants as the facts relating to that case was not similar. That

was a case where the owner of the dwelling house was occupying the premises

and the learned Magistrate before whom the application for a closing order was

made against him was directed to allow the owner of the dwelling house an

opportunity to show cause as to why the order should not be made.

However, in the instant appeal before this Court, it was not the owner who has

requested an opportunity to show cause, but the occupants of the dwelling who

were not the owners, who has not been provided with a right to be heard before

imposing a closing order.

As I view the provisions of section 77 of the Housing and Town Improvement

Ordinance, as stated previously, it is clear that the purpose of the section is to

prevent damage to human life and property by not allowing a building to stand

uninhabitable and dangerous, and not to make the said section as a tool to evict

any occupant of such a building. I am of the view that if such a building cannot

be restored back to a habitable condition, the purpose of the section and other

relevant sections in the Ordinance needs to be brought into operation as the

clear intention of the legislature has been expressed in formulating such a

provision as applicable law.

It is clear from the order made by the learned Magistrate of Panadura on 07-07-

1994 that the learned Magistrate was well aware of the relevant provisions of

section 77. It was quite obvious that the learned Additional Magistrate has

Page 33 of 34

decided to vacate the previous closing order on a totally wrong footing and

without any basis. Since it was the Magistrate who has finally signed and issued

the closing order, I do not find anything wrong in the learned Magistrates

determination in that regard, as viewed by their lordships of the Court of Appeal

when pronouncing the judgment dated 09-03-2012. It has been well considered

whether the Magistrate can make such an order on the basis that the previous

order was made per incuriam by the learned Additional Magistrate.

At this juncture, I would like to cite the two judgments cited by the Court of

Appeal as I find them appropriate for the purposes of this appeal as well.

In Sivapathalingham Vs. Siva Subaramaniam (1990) 1 SLR 378, the Supreme

Court held thus;

A Court whose act has caused injury to a suiter has an inherent power to

make restitution. This power is exercisable by a Court of original jurisdiction

as well as by a superior Court.

In Gunasena Vs. Bandaratilake (2000) 1 SLR 292, the Supreme Court held:

The Court of Appeal had inherent power to set aside the judgment dated

25-05-1998 and to repair the injury caused to the plaintiff by its own

mistake, notwithstanding the fact that the said judgment has passed the

decree of Court. This would not have been done otherwise than by writing

a fresh judgment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal clearly shows that it has gone on the basis

of the necessity to correct the mistakes made by the learned Additional

Magistrate in vacating the closing order previously made, and also making

several orders that are not within the law. It is in that process, the Court of

Appeal has allowed the order made by the learned Magistrate of Panadura on

07-07-1994.

Although it may look like a collusive action since the owner of the dwelling house,

who was the owner respondent named in the action has not opposed the closing

Page 34 of 34

order, in my view, that in itself cannot be considered as a reason to refuse to

allow a closing order made after following due process.

It is not possible for a Chairman of the Urban Council to demolish the dwelling

house on the strength of the closing order alone, as issuing a closing order is not

meant as an authorization for demolition. A separate provision has been made

in terms of section 81 of the Housing and Town Improvement Ordinance for a

Chairman to obtain an order for demolition only under certain conditions, which

again shows that the legislature in its wisdom has made clear and unambiguous

provisions in this regard.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no reason to interfere with the

judgment pronounced by the Court of Appeal on 09-03-2012.

Accordingly, the three questions of law as stated above is answered in the

negative.

The appeal is dismissed. There will be no costs of the appeal.
