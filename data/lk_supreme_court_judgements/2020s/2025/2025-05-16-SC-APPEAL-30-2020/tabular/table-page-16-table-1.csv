"course of action will be to declare afresh the results after a count made in  accordance"
"with the principles laid down in the Ordinance."
"For all the foregoing reasons, question of law No. 01 is answered in the negative."
"Question of Law No. 2"
"The Appellants submitted that Section 63 of Ordinance provides for the counting of votes"
"and Section 63(7) has specific provisions relating recounts.  Therefore it was contended"
"that any grievance based on the counting of votes, refusal to order a recount etc. would"
"be a matter that could be agitated by way of a writ application and is not provided for in"
"terms of the Ordinance and cannot form the basis of an  election  petition instituted in"
"terms of section 82Q of the Ordinance."
"I have already made reference to certain provisions in the Ordinance which shows that a"
"recount of the votes at an election petition is in fact envisaged."
"Moreover,  Section  63  of  the  Ordinance  provides  for  a  limited  recount  before  the  final"
"results are declared. The electoral process must be concluded without undue delay by the"
"declaration of the results. Hence the need to restrict the opportunity for a lengthy recount"
"process. Such considerations disappear  once it is established at the trial of an election"
"petition that the counting of the votes was not done in accordance with the principles laid"
"down in the Ordinance and that such non-compliance materially affected the result of the"
"election."
"I hold that there can be a recount of the votes at the trial of an election petition filed in"
"relation to an election for a local authority provided it is established that the counting of"
"the votes was not done in accordance with the principles laid down in the Ordinance and"
"that such non-compliance materially affected the result of the election."
"I answer question of law No. 2 in the negative."
