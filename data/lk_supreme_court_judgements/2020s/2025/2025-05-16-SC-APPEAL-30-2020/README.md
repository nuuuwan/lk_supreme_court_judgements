Janak De Silva, J.

This is an appeal arising out of an election petition filed by the Petitioner-Respondent

(Petitioner) in terms of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended (Ordinance).

The Petitioner contested as a candidate of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) at the

Local Authorities Elections held on 10.02.2018 from Ward No. 06 of the Kahatagasdigiliya

Pradeshiya Sabha.

According to the results declared, the 1st Respondent-Respondent (1st Respondent) who

contested from Independent Group No. 01 received 626 votes whereas the Petitioner

received 625 votes. Hence, the 1st Respondent was declared elected to Ward No. 06 by a

majority of 01 vote.

The Petitioner then filed this election petition in the Provincial High Court of North Central

Province holden in Anuradhapura. The Petitioner alleged that:

(i) Ward No. 06 is made of two voting stations, namely 6(a) and 6(b);

(ii) Out of a total of 1227 votes cast at voting station 6(a), only 1226 votes have

been counted;

(iii) The counting officers have rejected a substantial number of postal votes citing

that the packaging of the postal votes is not in order;

(iv) As 07 Wards out of 10 Wards comprising the Kahatagasdigiliya Pradeshiya

Sabha was won by the SLPP there is ground to believe that Ward No. 06 should

have also been won by the SLPP.

When the trial of the election petition commenced, the 7th and 8th Respondent-Appellants

(Appellants) raised the following preliminary objections:

(i) The petition has been filed out of time.

(ii) The relief sought by the Petitioner is outside Section 82S of the Ordinance.

(iii) The petition is vexatious.

Page 6 of 17

The learned Election Judge overruled all three preliminary objections. The Appellants

appealed. Leave to appeal has been granted on the following questions of law:

(1) Whether the learned Election Judge erred in law by failing to recognise that the

petition does not fulfil the ground set out in Section 82P(2) of the Ordinance?

(2) Whether the Election Judge erred in law by failing to consider statutory provisions

for recounting in terms of Section 63(7) and 63(8) of the Ordinance?

Question of Law No. 1

The Petitioner has in his petition prayed for the following relief:

a) Notice on the Respondents;

b) To direct the 7th and 8th Respondents to issue the election results and the

postal vote results cast in Kahatagasdigiliya Pradeshiya Sabha Ward No.6 to

the Petitioner-Respondent;

c) To direct the 7th and 8th Respondents to recount the election results and the

postal vote results cast in Kahatagasdigiliya Pradeshiya Sabha Ward No.6;

d) To declare that the 1st Respondent-Respondent has not been duly elected to

the Kahatagasdigiliya Pradeshiya Sabha after a recount of votes;

e) To declare that the Petitioner-Respondent is duly elected to the

Kahatagasdigiliya Pradeshiya Sabha after a recount of votes;

f) Costs;

g) Such other relief as considered appropriate by Court.

The Appellants contend that the relief claimed by the Petitioner is not in conformity with

Section 82(2) of the Ordinance. In particular, it is submitted that the relief sought by the

Petitioner is not to have the election in respect of any ward of an electoral area declared

Page 7 of 17

void as provided for under Section 82S(a) but to have the election of a candidate as a

member of any local authority declared void as provided for under Section 82P(2).

Therefore the Appellants submitted that the grounds that can be relied upon by the

Petitioner will necessarily have to be one or more of the grounds spelt out in Section

82P(2)(a)(d). According to the Appellants, none of these grounds relate to the recount of

votes at any counting centre. The provisions contained in Section 82P(1)(b) would not

apply in this instance since the Petitioner is not seeking to have the election in respect of

any ward of an electoral area declared void.

Let me examine these contentions in the context of Section 82P of the Ordinance.

Section 82P(1) reads as follows:

(1) The election in respect of any ward of any electoral area shall be declared

void on an election petition on the following grounds which may be proved to the

satisfaction of the Election Judge, namely

(a) that by reason of general bribery, general treating or general

intimidation or other misconduct or other circumstances whether similar

to those enumerated before or not a section of electors was prevented

from voting for the candidate of any recognised political party or

independent group which it preferred and there by materially affected

the result of the election;

(b) non-compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance relating to

elections, if it appears that the election was not conducted in

accordance with the principles laid down in such provisions and that

such non-compliance materially affected the result of the election.

(emphasis added)

Page 8 of 17

Section 82P(2) reads as follows:

(2) The election of a candidate as a member of any local authority shall be

declared void on an election petition on any of the following grounds which may be

proved to the satisfaction of the Election Judge, namely-

(a) that a corrupt or illegal practice was commuted in connection with the

election by the candidate or with his knowledge or consent or by any agent

of the candidate,

(b) that the candidate personally engaged a person as canvasser or agent

or to speak on his behalf knowing that such person had within seven years

previous to such engagement been found guilty of a corrupt practice under

the law relating to the election of the President or the law relating to

Referenda or under the Ceylon (Parliament Elections) Order in Council. 1946,

or under this Ordinance by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the report

of an Election Judge,

(c) that the candidate personally engaged person as a canvasser or agent

or to on his behalf knowing that such had been a person on whom disability

had been imposed resolution passed by Parliament of Article 81 of the

Constitution period of such civic disability specified in such resolution had

not expired,

(d) that the candidate was at the time of his election a person disqualified

for election as a member. (emphasis added)

Clearly Sections 82P(1) and 82P(2) deals with two different situations. Section 82P(1)

specifies the grounds on which the election in respect of any ward of any electoral area

shall be declared void. On the contrary, Section 82P(2) specifies the grounds on which the

election of a candidate shall be declared void.

Page 9 of 17

There is a clear rationale for this distinction. Section 82P(1) deals with acts which are

general in nature and which materially affect the result of the election. Such acts are not

attributable to a particular candidate. On the other hand, Section 82P(2) deals with acts

referable to a particular candidate which does not materially affect the result of the

election. They impinge only on the election of a particular candidate.

For example, Section 82P(1)(a) covers acts such as general bribery, treating or

intimidation. The election in respect of any ward of any electoral area shall be declared

void if as a result of the alleged acts, a section of electors was prevented from voting for

the candidate of any recognised political party or independent group which it preferred

and there by materially affected the result of the election.

Similarly, Section 82P(1)(b) cover situations where due to the non-compliance with the

provisions of the Ordinance relating to elections, it appears that the election was not

conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in such provisions and that such

non-compliance materially affected the result of the election. Here also the focus is not

on the conduct of a particular candidate.

On the other hand, where Section 82P(2) is engaged, there is no need for the impugned

conduct to have materially affected the result of the election. Where any one or more of

the circumstances set out in Sections 82P(2)(a)-(d) are established, the election of the said

candidate as a member of any local authority must be declared void irrespective of

whether the impugned conduct materially affected the result of the election in respect of

a ward of any electoral area.

The core complaint of the Petitioner is that the public officials entrusted with the task of

counting the votes cast failed to do it accurately. In this context, it is important to ascertain

what is meant by the words the election was not conducted in accordance with the

principles laid down in the provisions of the Ordinance in Section 82P(1)(b).

Page 10 of 17

The Ordinance was enacted in 1946 and provided the system of elections in respect of all

local authorities that had been established before the grant of independence. The

Ordinance provided a simple electoral process for all local authorities based on what was

commonly known as the "ward system". The area of each local authority was divided into

smaller units known as wards and the election was in respect of each such ward. The

winner of each ward of a local authority was selected on the first past the post system.

By Law No. 24 of 1977, this system was done away with and replaced by a system in which

the entire local authority became one electoral area. The election was conducted on a

proportional representation system.

From the inception, the Ordinance did not provide for the filing of election petitions to

impugn the results of local authorities elections. The only provision which provided for

impugning the election was Section 69 of the Ordinance which reads as follows:

No election shall be invalid by reason of any failure to comply with the provisions

of the Ordinance relating to elections if it appears that the election was conducted

in accordance with the principles laid down in such provisions, and that such failure

did not affect result of the election.

In Perera v. Madadombe (73 NLR 25 at 28), H.N.G. Fernando, C.J., held that although

Section 69 does not positively declare that an election will be invalid for any specified

reason, he can assume that such a declaration is implied in this section. He went on to

hold that on this assumption the declaration thus implied may properly be stated as

follows :-

"If there is in the case of any election a failure to comply with any of the provisions

of this Ordinance relating to elections, and if it appears that the election was not

conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in such provisions, and if it

Page 11 of 17

appears that thereby the result of the election was affected, the election. shall be

invalid."

This was the provision that litigants resorted to through administrative law remedies to

try and impugn local authority elections. On the contrary, the Presidential Elections Act

No. 15 of 1981, the Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981 and the Provincial Councils

Elections Act, No. 2 of 1988, all provide for an election to be annulled according to the

procedure laid down in those enactments. It is in this context that Wijetunga, J. in Gamini

Atukorale v. Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and Others [(1998) 3

Sri LR 206 at 220] opined as follows:

Therefore, one cannot but conclude that the failure to make such provision in

respect of elections to local authorities was deliberate on the part of the

Legislature. If that be the case, the time is ripe for this court to draw the attention

of the Legislature to the crying need for appropriate provisions to be made for the

invalidation of impugned elections under this Ordinance on grounds similar to those

contained in the other statutes aforementioned. Otherwise, the concept of a free

and fair election and the citizen's right to elect representatives of his choice to the

local authority of his area would not merely be a myth, but a farce.

These observations may well have resulted in the legislature enacting Local Authorities

Elections (Amendment) Act No. 1 of 2002 which provided for the institution of election

petitions to impugn local authority elections by the introduction of Sections 82O to 82AM.

In this context, it is interesting to observe that the wording in Section 82P(1)(b) and

Section 69 as interpreted in Perera v. Madadombe (supra) is substantially the same. In

Perera (supra. at page 29) H.N.G. Fernando, C.J., held that:

The first condition in the declaration to be implied in s. 69 is that there must be a

failure to comply with some provision of the Ordinance. This expression is

Page 12 of 17

appropriate to a case where a public officer does not perform an act or duty which

some provision of the Ordinance requires him to perform, because if so the officer

clearly fails to comply with that provision.

In Gamini Atukorale (supra. at 213), it was held that non-compliance with the provisions

of the Ordinance referred to in Section 69 necessarily envisages the acts of the officers

concerned with the conduct of such election.

Statutes in pari materia must be interpreted harmoniously. This rule of interpretation

extends to similar provisions in the same statute. Moreover, where the legislature enacts

a provision which is similar to an existing statutory provision that has already been

interpreted by the highest court of the land, it must be presumed that the legislature was

aware of such interpretation and enacted a similar provision with that interpretation in

mind.

Bindra [Bindras Interpretation of Statutes, 10th ed., page 235] states as follows:

The legislature must be presumed to know the course of legislation, as well as the

course of judicial decisions in the country, a fortiorari of the superior courts of the

country.

In Nilamdeen v. Nanayakkara (76 NLR 169 at 171) it was held that it is a well-known rule

of construction that where the legislature uses in an Act a legal term which has received

judicial interpretation, it must be assumed that the term is used in the sense in which it

has been judicially interpreted.

Section 24 of the Ordinance directs that every general election of the members of a local

authority shall be held in the manner provided by the Ordinance. Sections 26 to 68 of the

Ordinance sets out the procedure to be followed in conducting the election. The election

must be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in these provisions. The

relevant principles must be distilled from those provisions.

Page 13 of 17

I therefore hold that that non-compliance with the provisions of the Ordinance referred

to in Section 82P(1)(b) implies the failure on the part of the officers conducting the

election to conduct of the election in accordance with such principles.

In so far as the conduct of the local authority elections, and in particular the counting of

votes is concerned, these principles include the following:

(i) The election must be held in a free and fair manner so as to ensure that the

voters can cast their votes freely according to their will.

(ii) The counting of votes must be conducted in a transparent manner.

(iii) All validly cast votes must be counted in favour of the recognized political party

or independent group in whose favour the vote was cast.

(iv) All invalid votes must be rejected.

(v) The final result of a Ward of an electoral area must reflect the true will of the

voters.

The core complaint of the Petitioner is that the public officials entrusted with the task of

counting the votes cast failed to do it accurately. No allegations have been made against

the conduct of the 1st Respondent. Therefore, the core complaint of the Petitioner falls

within Section 82P(1)(b) of the Ordinance.

The contention of the Appellants that the relief claimed by the Petitioner is not in

conformity with the provisions in Section 82P(2) of the Ordinance is also misconceived in

law.

A careful examination of the provisions in Sections 82P(1)(a) and 82P(1)(b) makes it clear

that the consequences of the circumstances referred to therein may vary. For example,

where there has been general bribery, treating or intimidation the result of the election

may be materially tainted so that there is no way to ascertain the true will of the voters

Page 14 of 17

from the votes cast. The election in respect of that Ward of any electoral area will then

have to be declared void.

On the other hand, Section 82P(1)(b) may apply to a situation where the voting was

conducted in a free and fair manner but the counting of the votes was done contrary to

the principles laid down in the applicable provisions. Here, there is no need to declare the

whole election void. The aberration in the counting process can be corrected by a fresh

count and the result declared to reflect the true will of the voter.

The contention of the Petitioner is that if the votes cast at the aforesaid election was

correctly counted, he would have been returned elected to Ward No. 06 and not the 1st

Respondent. The Petitioner has sought a declaration that the 1st Respondent has not been

duly elected to the Kahatagasdigiliya Pradeshiya Sabha after a recount of votes and a

declaration that the Petitioner is duly elected to the Kahatagasdigiliya Pradeshiya Sabha

after a recount of votes. They fall within Section 82S(b) and 82S(c) of the Ordinance. In

the circumstances of this appeal, there was no need for the Petitioner to have also prayed

for a declaration that the election in respect of ward No. 06 of Kahatagasdigiliya local

authority electoral area is void. The election was duly conducted but the counting of the

votes was not.

I am mindful that Section 82P(1) specifies that election in respect of any ward of any

electoral area shall be declared void. Nevertheless, it is an established rule of

interpretation that the grant of a greater includes the lessor (Omne majus continent in se

minus) [See The Queen v. A.D. Hemapala (65 NLR 313 at 322); M.B. Ibralebbe (alias

Rasa Wattan) v. The Queen (65 NLR 433 at 435); Bulankulama and Others v. Secretary,

Ministry of Industrial Development and Others (2000) 3 Sri LR 243 at 260, 261;

Government Medical Officers Association and Another v. Senanayake (2001) 3 Sri LR 377

at 387; Thavaneethan v. Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and Others

(2003) 1 Sri LR 74 at 94; The Superintendent, Stafford Estate and Two Others v.

Page 15 of 17

Solaimuthu Rasu (2013) 1 Sri LR 25 at 32; Commissioner General of Inland Revenue vs.

Janashakthi General Insurance Ltd (2020) 3 Sri LR 259 at 271].

Accordingly, I hold that there will be situations where, even though Section 82P(1) applies,

the Election Judge can limit the relief to a recount of votes and a fresh declaration of the

results based on such recount. This will enhance the immutable republican principles of

representative democracy on which our Constitution is founded and advance the

franchise of the people.

However, the Appellants contended that a recount of the votes is not a relief that can be

claimed by a petitioner in an election petition. This is also misconceived in law.

Pursuant to Section 67(3) of the Ordinance, the Elections Officer shall retain the packets

of ballot papers and all documents forwarded to him in accordance with Section 67(2) for

a period of six months reckoned from the date of the receipt thereof and shall thereafter

cause the said packets and documents to be destroyed.

According to Section 82AF(1), every election petition under the Ordinance shall be

presented within twenty-one days of the date of publication of the results of the election

in the Gazette. Therefore, the Election Officer will be put on notice of the filing of an

election petition before he becomes entitled to destroy the ballot papers and all

documents forwarded to him. He will have to retain the ballot papers and documents until

the conclusion of the trial of the election petition.

Moreover, there is clear indication that the Ordinance does provide for a recount of the

votes cast consequent to an election petition. Section 82AH(1) provides for the scrutiny

and striking off of the vote of any person or persons.

Furthermore, if it is established at the trial of an election petition that the votes for a

Ward were not counted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Ordinance and

that such non-compliance materially affected the result of the election, the justifiable

Page 16 of 17

course of action will be to declare afresh the results after a count made in accordance

with the principles laid down in the Ordinance.

For all the foregoing reasons, question of law No. 01 is answered in the negative.

Question of Law No. 2

The Appellants submitted that Section 63 of Ordinance provides for the counting of votes

and Section 63(7) has specific provisions relating recounts. Therefore it was contended

that any grievance based on the counting of votes, refusal to order a recount etc. would

be a matter that could be agitated by way of a writ application and is not provided for in

terms of the Ordinance and cannot form the basis of an election petition instituted in

terms of section 82Q of the Ordinance.

I have already made reference to certain provisions in the Ordinance which shows that a

recount of the votes at an election petition is in fact envisaged.

Moreover, Section 63 of the Ordinance provides for a limited recount before the final

results are declared. The electoral process must be concluded without undue delay by the

declaration of the results. Hence the need to restrict the opportunity for a lengthy recount

process. Such considerations disappear once it is established at the trial of an election

petition that the counting of the votes was not done in accordance with the principles laid

down in the Ordinance and that such non-compliance materially affected the result of the

election.

I hold that there can be a recount of the votes at the trial of an election petition filed in

relation to an election for a local authority provided it is established that the counting of

the votes was not done in accordance with the principles laid down in the Ordinance and

that such non-compliance materially affected the result of the election.

I answer question of law No. 2 in the negative.

For all the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed. Parties shall bear their costs.
