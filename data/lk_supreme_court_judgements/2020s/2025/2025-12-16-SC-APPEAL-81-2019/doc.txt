Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this writ application in the Court of Appeal seeking, inter

alia, a writ of certiorari to quash the decision of the Divisional Secretary of

Polonnaruwa to transfer the original ownership of the land, which forms the

subject matter of this application, to the 4ᵗʰ respondent, Benjamin Rosa, as

reflected in the Register marked P6(c).

3

SC/APPEAL/81/2019

The Sinhala copy of the original Permit issued under the Land Development

Ordinance in the name of Edwin Rosa, the petitioner’s grandfather, was

marked P2. His wife was Lucia Fernando. As seen from P2, Edwin Rosa had

nominated his elder son, Joseph Rosa, as his successor. Joseph Rosa is the

petitioner’s father. Thereafter, the name of Joseph Rosa has been struck off

with a single line, and the name of Benjamin Rosa has been entered as the

successor. Benjamin Rosa is the younger son of Edwin Rosa and the brother

of the petitioner’s father. It is not the petitioner’s complaint that a

nomination, once made, cannot be changed. Under sections 53 and 54 of

the Land Development Ordinance, any nomination of a successor may be

cancelled at any time by the owner or Permit-holder who made such

nomination, and a fresh nomination may be made. The petitioner’s

complaint before the Court of Appeal was that “it is not stated in the Permit

or in any other document as to when, or by whom, or on what grounds this

name has been entered in this manner.”

In the Court of Appeal, the Divisional Secretary tendered the English copy

of the original Permit as 1R1 and the Land Ledger as 1R2. As evidenced by

the death certificate marked P3, Edwin Rosa died on 01.03.1979. This

confirms that the cancellation of the earlier nomination and the making of

a fresh nomination occurred during his lifetime. According to 1R1 and 1R2,

Edwin Rosa nominated his elder son, Joseph Rosa, as his successor on

08.04.1954. Thereafter, on 27.08.1963, he nominated his younger son,

Benjamin Rosa, as his successor in place of his elder son, Joseph Rosa.

These entries appear in Permit 1R1 and in the Land Ledger marked 1R2. In

the absence of any evidence to the contrary, the Court is entitled to presume

that official acts have been regularly performed, in terms of Illustration (d)

to section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Edwin Rosa did not nominate his wife, Lucia Fernando, as his successor to

the land in the Permit. However, upon his death, and by operation of law,

4

SC/APPEAL/81/2019

Lucia Fernando succeeded to the land, and the Grant marked P5 was

thereafter issued in her name in terms of section 48A of the Land

Development Ordinance.

As seen from P6(a) and P6(b), although she had purported to nominate

several persons in the Grant issued to her, including the petitioner (her

grandson), as successors, those nominations are without legal effect.

Section 48A(2)(b) expressly prevents the spouse of the deceased permit-

holder from nominating a successor to the land. In accordance with section

48B(1)(c), the same restriction applies where the spouse is that of the owner

of a holding, that is, a person in whose favour a Grant had been issued.

The spouse can only enjoy the land during his or her lifetime. Upon the

death of the spouse, the person nominated as successor by the deceased

permit-holder or owner of the holding, or, where there is no such

nomination, the person entitled to succeed under Rule 1 of the Third

Schedule to the Ordinance, shall succeed to the land.

Sections 48A and 48B read as follows:

48A(1) Upon the death of a permit-holder who at the time of his or her

death was required to pay any annual instalments by virtue of the

provisions of subsection (2) of section 19, notwithstanding default in

the payment of such instalments, the spouse of that permit-holder,

whether he or she has or has not been nominated as successor by that

permit-holder, shall be entitled to succeed to the land alienated to that

permit-holder on the permit and the terms and conditions of that permit

shall be applicable to that spouse.

(2) If, during the lifetime of the spouse of a deceased permit-holder who

has succeeded under subsection (1) to the land alienated on the permit,

the terms and conditions of the permit are complied with by such

5

SC/APPEAL/81/2019

spouse, such spouse shall be entitled to a grant of that land subject to

the following conditions:-

(a) such spouse shall have no power to dispose of the land alienated

by the grant;

(b) such spouse shall have no power to nominate a successor to that

land;

(c) upon the death of such spouse, or upon his or her marriage, the

person, who was nominated as successor by the deceased

permit-holder or who would have been entitled to succeed as his

successor, shall succeed to that land:

Provided that the aforesaid conditions shall not apply to a grant of any

land to be made to a spouse who has been nominated by the deceased

permit-holder to succeed to the land alienated on the permit.

(3) Any disposition or nomination made by a spouse in contravention of

the provisions of subsection (2) shall be invalid.

48B(1) Upon the death of the owner of a holding, the spouse of that

owner shall be entitled to succeed to that holding subject to the

following conditions:-

(a) upon the marriage of such spouse, title to the holding shall

devolve on the nominated successor of the deceased owner or, if

there was no such nomination, on the person who was entitled

to succeed under rule 1 of the Third Schedule;

(b) such spouse shall have no power to dispose of that holding;

(c) such spouse shall have no power to nominate a successor to that

holding:

6

SC/APPEAL/81/2019

Provided that the aforesaid conditions shall not apply to a spouse who

has been nominated by the deceased owner of the holding to succeed

to that holding.

(2) Any disposition or nomination made by a spouse in contravention of

the provisions of subsection (1) shall be invalid.

According to the death certificate marked P4(a), Lucia Fernando died on

06.01.2013. As the permit-holder, Edwin Rosa did not nominate her in the

Permit as his successor, and therefore upon her death, Benjamin Rosa, the

person nominated by Edwin Rosa, shall succeed to the land. Accordingly,

the decision of the Divisional Secretary of Polonnaruwa to transfer the

ownership of the land to the 4ᵗʰ Respondent, Benjamin Rosa, as reflected in

the Register marked P6(c), is flawless.

Accordingly, the dismissal of the petitioner’s writ application by the Court

of Appeal is correct, although the petitioner has sought to challenge that

judgment before this Court. A previous Bench of this Court granted leave to

appeal on the question whether the Court of Appeal erred in not considering

that the name of the petitioner’s father, which had initially been included

as the successor to the land, had been struck off and the name of the 4ᵗʰ

respondent was inserted unlawfully. I answer that question of law in the

negative. The appeal is dismissed, but without costs.
