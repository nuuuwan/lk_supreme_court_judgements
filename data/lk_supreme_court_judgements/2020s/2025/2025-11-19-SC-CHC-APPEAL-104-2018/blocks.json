The \ufb01rst is whether the Plain\u019f\ufb00s \u2013 Appellants [the Plain\u019f\ufb00s] have proved that a sum of Rs. 68m they claim was due to them from the 4th Defendant \u2013 Respondent [the 4th Defendant] has been remi\u01a9ed by the 4th Defendant to the 1st \u2013 3rd Defendants \u2013 Respondents [the Defendants/KKH]. The second is, if so, whether the Defendants have been unjustly enriched by their refusal to pay the Plain\u019f\ufb00s a sum of Rs. 55m out of the said sum of money. Background to the appeal 2) The Plain\u019f\ufb00s \ufb01led ac\u019fon in the High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo exercising commercial jurisdic\u019fon [the Commercial High Court/the High Court] on 6th June 2006 against the Defendants under eight causes of ac\u019fon and an alterna\u019fve 8th cause of ac\u019fon. The Ceylon Electricity Board had been named as the 4th Defendant only for the purpose of no\u019fce and no relief had been claimed against the 4th Defendant.",

The Plain\u019f\ufb00s did not resist this objec\u019fon and had informed the High Court that it will not be pursuing the 1st and 2nd causes of ac\u019fon. 4) The Defendants had also raised an objec\u019fon that the 3rd, 4th and 5th causes of ac\u019fon are prescribed. Having heard the par\u019fes, this objec\u019fon had been upheld by the High Court by its order delivered on 4th March 2009 and those three causes of ac\u019fon had been dismissed. 5) The case proceeded to trial therea\u014cer with only the 6th, 7th and 8th causes of ac\u019fon [together with the alterna\u019fve 8th cause of ac\u019fon] remaining to be decided. While the 2nd Plain\u019f\ufb00 gave evidence on behalf of the Plain\u019f\ufb00s, the Defendants did not lead any evidence. By its judgment delivered on 3rd August 2018, the High Court held that the 6th and 7th causes of ac\u019fon too are prescribed, and that the Plain\u019f\ufb00s have failed to establish the 8th cause of ac\u019fon and the alterna\u019fve 8th cause of ac\u019fon. 6) Aggrieved by the said judgment, the Plain\u019f\ufb00s \ufb01led this appeal. At the hearing, the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Plain\u019f\ufb00s submi\u01a9ed that he would be limi\u019fng his submissions to the rejec\u019fon of the 8th cause of ac\u019fon that alleged that the Defendants had been unjustly enriched in a sum of Rs. 55m, and the alterna\u019fve 8th cause of ac\u019fon.
