"In the instant case, even accepting the Respondents’ submission that the correction of"
"error was to withdraw the three increments granted to officers not belonging to the All Island"
"Service and posts for which equivalent salaries have been assigned is justified, the decision for"
"such process took place only in 2012, upon issuance of PA Circular 06/2006 (X) after four"
"years.  In  the  words  of  Mark  Fernando,  J.,  in  the  Dona  Diana  case,  a  delay  of  four  years"
"displays a lack of concern for rights and interests of persons."
"However, it is seen that paragraph 04 of PA Circular 06/2006 (X) refers and defines"
"persons  entitled  to  salary  conversions  and  paragraph  02  illustrate  how  to  rectify  the  salary"
"conversions  and  show  the  manner  in  which  calculation  should  be  made.  Why  couldn’t  the"
"Respondents issue these guidelines earlier? Why was not it referred to in PA Circular 06/2006"
"(VII) itself? The Respondents have not given any justifiable reason for the omission and delay."
"In my view, the undue delay taken for the correction of an error, even if it can be referred to"
"as an error, amply showcase that the Respondents have acted in a callous manner, without an"
"iota of thought about public officers who will be affected by such provisions. Such action or"
"inaction of the Respondents resulted in the Petitioners being denied the Fundamental Right of"
"equal protection of the law."
"The PA Circular 06/2006 (X) is also silent and does not refer to public officers who"
"have retired, subsequent to the issuance of PA Circular 06/2006 (VII). Hence, it is apparent"
"that PA Circular 06/2006 (X) is also ambiguous and has many gaps and shortcomings."
"In  such  a  situation,  when  there  is  no  clarity  and  certainty  in  the  language  and  the"
"wording of the circular, should the Petitioners be penalized? Isn’t it a mistake in calculation,"
"which happened, due to the actions of the Respondents and not due to Petitioners before Court?"
"As  stated  earlier,  the  PA  Circular  06/2006  (X)  indicates  the  manner  in  which  such"
"rectifications  should  be  done  and  also  gives  illustrations  as  to  how  calculations  need  to  be"
"done. Furthermore paragraph 04 states, who can be and should be identified in order to grant"
"the benefits of PA Circular 06/2006 (VII). In any event, is this the policy of the Government?"
"Whilst the PA Circular 06/2006 (VII) indicates it is issued with the concurrence of the National"
"Salaries and Cadre Commission and the General Treasury, the PA Circular 06/2006 (X) only"
"refers to the General Treasury and not the National Salaries and Cadre Commission, which"
"bestowed the SL-1-2006 salary scale to the Petitioners."
"The Respondents strenuously argued that the said provisions contained in paragraph 04"
"of PA Circular 06/2006 (X) has no retrospective effect and was only a clarification. Then what"
"is the rationale to have such a definition in the said circular? Weren’t the Respondents aware"
"as to who should be considered to fall within the ambit of PA Circular 06/2006 (VII)?"
"I do not wish to delve into the area of retrospectiveness at this stage. Suffice is to state"
"PA Circular 06/2006 (X) appears to clarify and categorize public officers, who should have"
"been granted the benefit referred to in PA Circular 06/2006 (VII)."
