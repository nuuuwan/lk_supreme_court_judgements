"In  Dona  Diana  Pearly  v.  Premarathne,  Acting  Secretary  Educational  Service"
"Board and another [1997] 3 SLR 77, Mark Fernando J., lucidly observed;"
"“The  power  of  appointment  entrusted  to  the  appointing"
"authority  had  not  only  to  be  exercised  correctly  and  fairly,  but"
"when it came to the correction of an error-expeditiously as well."
"And it was not enough to correct the error, the Petitioner should"
"also  have  been  told  what  effect  it  had  on  her  eligibility  for  a"
"teaching  appointment.  That  was  an  expectation,  an  interest,  a"
"safeguard, a protection which the petitioner had. While a delay of"
"a few weeks was permissible, I cannot assume that a delay of"
"over eight months in correcting the error, and the failure of"
"over a year to say how it affected her, were necessary, normal"
"or  usual;  that  displayed  a  lack  of  concern  for  the  rights  and"
"interest of candidates constituting, in the circumstances, a denial"
"of the equal protection of the law” (emphasis added)"
