"We are also mindful of the submissions made by the Respondents, that the correction"
"of the anomaly referred to in PA Circular 06/2006 (VII) should have been in respect of only"
"officers in the All Island Services and officers who are in posts for which equal salaries have"
"been assigned by the National Salaries and Cadre Commission. We fail to understand if so,"
"why the said fact could not have been stated clearly and explicitly in the circular itself."
"However, we note that the SLTES officers have also been granted a salary scale, equal"
"to  officers  in  All  Island  Services,  by  the  National  Salaries  and  Cadre  Commission,  though"
"SLTES is not an All Island Service as per the Service Minute of the SLTES."
"Having examined all the above, we are of the view that the Respondents have failed to"
"justify the legal basis upon which a decision was made to recover the sums already paid to the"
"Petitioners during the years 2008 to 2012."
"Does the delay on the part of the Respondent act as a detriment on the Petitioner?"
"We have gone over PA Circular 06/2006 (VII) and PA Circular 06/2006 (X) in great"
"detail and we find the circular lacks clarity. Indecisiveness may have led to the provisions of"
"the circular not being properly interpreted or it could be for some other reason not divulged to"
"Court, that the purported mistake or error has occurred and repeated for a period of four years"
"without correction."
