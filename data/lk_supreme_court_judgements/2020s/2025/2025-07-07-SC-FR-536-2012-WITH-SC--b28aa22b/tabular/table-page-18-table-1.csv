"Our Courts have always accepted that the State is at liberty to alter policy. Nevertheless,"
"it has also been held that it cannot ignore the expectations engendered by its actions and or"
"conduct. Ref: Dayaratne v. Minster of Health [Supra]."
"Considering the aforesaid, it is apparent that by issuance of PA Circular 06/2006 (VII)"
"the Petitioners were given a reasonable expectation that the salaries and pensions would be"
"enhanced. Thus, the arbitrary reduction of the salary and the pension, post retirement by PA"
"Circular 06/2006 (X) i.e., by executive and administrative action, upon the basis it is erroneous"
"and especially considering the conduct of the Respondents to withdraw the increments granted"
"and to recover  such payments  from the Petitioners salaries  and pension, after  four  years of"
"granting  of  such  payments,  in  my  view  violates  the  Fundamental  Rights  of  the  Petitioners"
"guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"We  have  also  considered  the  numerous  grounds  relied  upon  by  the  Petitioners  to"
"substantiate  the  case  not  only  through  the  lens  of  a  Fundamental  Rights  violation,  but  also"
"through the concepts of judicial review, especially in respect of the Petitioners who have retired"
"from public service and are now drawing a pension."
"We are mindful, that the Petitioners have opted to come before this Court vis-â-vis go"
"before the writ court, and has already obtained interim relief."
"We have also considered the time bar objection and the other technical objections raised"
"by the Respondents before Court and we see no merit in the said submissions."
"Having  examined  the  overall  picture  pertaining  to  the  grievances  of  the  Petitioners,"
"both serving public officers and the retirees, we hold that the Petitioners’ Fundamental Rights"
"to the equal protection of the law guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been"
"violated by the executive and or administrative actions of the Respondents."
"We accordingly grant a Declaration that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners have"
"been infringed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"Further, we declare that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners guaranteed by Article"
"12(1) of the Constitution, have been infringed by the actions of the 1st to 6th Respondents in"
"SC/FR 536/2012 and the action of the 1st to 3rd Respondents, in SC/FR 560/2012 respectively."
"We  declare  that  the  decisions  made  by  the  aforesaid  Respondents,  in  the  said  two"
"applications to recover the increments granted to the Petitioners are null and void. We direct"
"that the said decisions be cancelled forthwith."
"In view of the interim relief granted by this Court in October 2012, the Respondents"
"were restrained from making any deductions from the salaries and pensions of the Petitioners,"
"in terms of the provisions of PA Circular 06/2006 (X) dated 26.03.2012."
