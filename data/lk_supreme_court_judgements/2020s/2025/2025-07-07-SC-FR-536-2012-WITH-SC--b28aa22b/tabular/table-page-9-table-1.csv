"However, prior to implementing the new salary structure all posts/services in the public"
"service had to be re-categorized and re-grouped by each Ministry based on definitions given"
"in annexure II of the circular. Annexure III provided for the salary conversions applicable to"
"the different services and posts and the new salary codes that will be applicable."
"Admittedly, SLTES and the Petitioners were not in an All Island Service and were not"
"included in the list provided for in annexure III to this circular."
"Consequent  to  the  issuance  of  PA  Circular  06/2006,  representations  were  made  by"
"members of SLTES to the National Salaries and Cadre Commission [the relevant authority as"
"provided by the  circular] and it  was recommended that the salary scale SL-1-2006, will be"
"applicable to the SLTES."
"The principle submission of the State was that, although the SLTES was recommended"
"the salary scale SL-1-2006, that the SLTES was not categorized as an All Island Service by"
"the National Salaries and Cadre Commission."
"Corollary, the position of the Petitioners was that SLTES was considered an All Island"
"Service for all due purposes, though it was specifically not categorized as an All Island Service."
