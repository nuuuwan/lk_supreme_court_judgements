"The  substantial  objection  of  the  Respondents  was  that  the  PA  Circular  bearing  No."
"06/2006 (VII) issued in 2008 had no relevance to the SLTES. Therefore, it was contended that"
"the three increments granted to the Petitioners was a bona-fide error made by the Department"
"of Technical Education and Training, and the Petitioners were not entitled in law to benefit"
"from an administrative mistake. In the said circumstances, it was pleaded that the course of"
"action followed to recover the erroneous payments, was is in accordance with the law."
"The case presented by the learned DSG on behalf of the Respondents, at the hearing"
"was also on similar lines. viz., the PA Circular 06/2006 (VII) had no bearing on the officers of"
"the SLTES. It applied only to officers of the All Island Services and certain other services."
"However  officers  of  certain  other  services  including  the  SLTES  had  also  converted  their"
"salaries based on this circular. This error had to be corrected. In order to rectify such wrong"
"doing which arose upon the erroneous implementation of the said PA Circular 06/2006 (VII),"
"the course of action taken by the Respondents to recover the overpayments from the Petitioners"
"is just and fair."
"The learned DSG further contended, that the Petitioners had been paid inflated salaries"
"and  pensions  and  were  unjustly  enriched,  in  view  of  a  wrong  interpretation  given  by  the"
"Department  of  Technical  Education  and  Training  and  therefore,  that  the  Petitioners  were"
"drawing salaries and pensions which they were not entitled to receive and thus, recovering of"
"such overpayments was in order and permitted by law."
"The learned DSG heavily relied upon PA Circular 06/2006 (X) and Section 43 A of the"
"Minutes  on  Pension, 
to  substantiate  her  argument.  She  also  drew  our  attention 
to 
the"
"observations  made 
in 
the  case  of  G.M.Nimalsiri  v.  Col.  PPJ  Fernando  and  others"
"SC/FR/256/2010 â€“ S.C.M. 17-09-2015 to justify her contention that the Petitioners have no"
"legitimate expectation in continuing to receive an incorrectly computed salary and pension."
"We  observe, 
that  while 
the  Respondents,  have  not 
filed  post-hearing  written"
"submissions, the Petitioners have filed copious written submissions supported by numerous"
"judicial concepts supported by case law to justify their contention, that the defence of bona-"
"fide  error  and/or 
that 
the  PA  Circular  No.  06/2006(VII)  was 
interpreted  and  applied"
"erroneously and incorrectly, is baseless. It was also the submission of the Petitioners that PA"
"Circular  No.  06/2006  (X)  contained  subsequent  additions  and  new  interpretations  which"
"rendered  the  provisions  of  the  said  circular  to  have  retrospective  effect,  which  is  not  in"
"accordance with the law and therefore cannot be relied upon to penalize the Petitioners."
