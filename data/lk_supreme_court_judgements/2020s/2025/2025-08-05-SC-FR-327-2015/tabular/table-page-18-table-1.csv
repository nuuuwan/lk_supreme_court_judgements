"However, there is no evidence before us of any such direction by the Minister to the Board"
"of Directors of the 1st Respondent. The impugned promotions and salary increments have"
"admittedly been granted by the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent."
"In any event, the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent is not legally bound to give"
"effect to illegal directions of the Minister. They exercise statutory powers vested on them"
"in terms of the SLBC Act and hold them in trust on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka and"
"not the Minister or their political masters.  Should they fail to exercise their powers and"
"functions in accordance with the public trust doctrine, a fundamental rights application"
"can be maintained against them and they can be personally held accountable."
"I overrule this preliminary objection."
"Suppression or Misrepresentation of Material Facts"
"The Respondents claim that the Petitioners have failed to disclose that they had received"
"promotions without being subjected to an interview and without relying on any scheme"
"of recruitment and promotion, and purely on political patronage of being the members"
"of the 9th Petitioner Union."
"Admittedly,  a  fundamental  rights  application  is  liable  to  be  dismissed  in  limine  where"
"there has been a suppression or misrepresentation of material facts [Liyanage and Others"
