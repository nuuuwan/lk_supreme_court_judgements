Decided on: 05.08.2025

Janak De Silva, J.

The 1st to 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th and 16th Petitioners are employees of the Sri Lanka

Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC), the 1st Respondent. The 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th

Petitioners are the Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya, SLBC Engineers' Association,

SLBC Technical Officers' Union and the SLBC Radio Broadcasters Union respectively. The

10th and 12th Petitioners are Secretaries of the 9th and 11th Petitioner Unions and the 14th

Petitioner is the Assistant Secretary of the 13th Petitioner. The 16th Petitioner is the

President of the 15th Petitioner. The Petitioners state that the 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th

Petitioners file this application in the interests of their Members who are adversely

affected by the impugned infringement of the fundamental rights of its members.

At all times material to this application, the 2nd Respondent was the Chairman and the 3rd

to 7th Respondents were members of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent. The

8th Respondent was the Director General and Chief Executive Officer of the 1st

Respondent.

The Petitioners allege that the 9th to 41st Respondents, who are also employees of the 1st

Respondent, were granted promotions without calling for applications contrary to the

scheme of recruitment and promotions. They further allege that the 42nd to 65th

Respondents, who are also employees of the 1st Respondent, were granted salary

increments personal to them contrary to regular annual increment scheme.

Leave to proceed has been granted under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Page 12 of 24

The 9th to 41st Respondents and several others not identified in the petition have been

granted promotions to higher posts. The Petitioners claim that these promotions have

been made in terms of a decision of the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent held on

25.05.2015. It is alleged that this was done contrary to the scheme of recruitment and

promotion and as they are members of the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS).

Only the 8th and 9th Respondents have filed objections in the form of affidavits.

The 8th Respondent admits that the 9th to 41st Respondents were granted promotions and

that the 42nd to 65th Respondents were granted salary increments personal to them. He

denies that these were made contrary to the scheme of recruitment and promotion. The

8th Respondent claims that the 1st Respondent never had an approved scheme of

recruitment and promotions and that the impugned promotions and salary increments

were given based on the powers vested in the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent in

terms of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation Law No. 5 of 1974 as amended (SLBC

Law). This was done as the 9th to 41st Respondents and the 42nd to 65th Respondents were

continuously overlooked for promotions and salary increments for the last 20 years by

virtue of them being members of the JSS.

The Respondents raised three preliminary objections namely (a) Time bar, (b) Necessary

parties and (c) Misrepresentation or suppression of material facts.

Time Bar

This application was filed on 11.08.2015. The impugned decision was made on

25.05.2015.

Article 126 (2) of the Constitution states that:

Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language right

relating to such person has been infringed or is about to be infringed by executive

or administrative action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law on his behalf,

Page 13 of 24

within one month thereof, in accordance with such rules of Court as may be in

force, apply to the Supreme Court by way of a petition in writing addressed to such

Court (emphasis added)

It is trite law that time begins to run from the date that the Petitioners became aware of

the infringement or imminent infringement [Edirisuriya v. Navaratnam and others

(1985) 1 Sri LR 100; Siriwardena v. Brigadier Rodrigo (1986) 1 Sri LR 384 at 387;

Gamaethige v. Siriwardena [1988] 1 Sri LR 384; Gunawardena v. Senanayake FRD (1)

177; Narendrakumar v. Ziyard and others (2000) 1 Sri LR] 252, 258; Dayaratne and

others v. National Savings Bank and others (2002) 3 Sri LR 116; Balachandra Arachchige

Don Nuwan v. C. D. Wickramaratne (SC Application No. 46/2021, Supreme Court

Minutes 23.11.2022 at pg. 7), Hewakuruppu v. Tea Commissioner (SC/FR Application

No. 118/84 , S.C.M. 10.11.1984); Sri Lanka Nidahas Rubber Inspectors Union and others

v. Members of the Public Service Commission and others (SCFR Application 109/2015,

S.C.M. 25.09.2019.); Weerathunga Arachchige Michael Padmasiri v. The Governor

Southern Province (SCFR) Application No: 211/2016, S.C.M. 02.08.2023.at page 14].

The Petitioners claim that they became aware of the impugned acts on or about

15.06.2015. On this basis, the application is time barred.

Nevertheless, the Petitioners contend that they have made complaints to the Human

Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) marked P27A to 27H.

Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 (HRCSL

Act), stipulates that:

Where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms of section 14, to the

Commission, within one month of the alleged infringement or imminent

infringement of a fundamental right by executive or administrative action, the

period within which the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the

Page 14 of 24

Commission, shall not be taken into account in computing the period of one month

within which an application may be made to the Supreme Court by such person in

terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

In Thilangani Kandambi v. State Timber Corporation & Others (S.C.F.R. Application No:

452/2019; S.C.M. 14.12.2022 at page 9), I identified four key principles on the application

of Section 13(1) of the Act in relation to Article 126(2) of the Constitution. They are as

follows:

a) The initial view was that mere production of a complaint made to the HRCSL within

one month of the alleged infringement is sufficient to get the benefit of the provisions

in section 13(1) of the HRCSL Act [Romesh Coorey v Jayalath (2008) 2 Sri.L.R. 43, Alles

v. Road Passenger Services Authority of the Western Province, (S.C.F.R. 448/2009,

S.C.M. 22.02.2013)].

b) However, the present position is that a petitioner must show evidence that the HRCSL

has conducted an inquiry regarding the complaint or that an inquiry is pending. Simply

lodging a complaint is inadequate. [Subasinghe v. Inspector General of Police, SC (Spl)

16/1999, S.C.M. 11.09.2000; Kariyawasam v. Southern Provincial Road Development

Authority and 8 Others, (2007) 2 Sri.L.R. 33; Ranaweera and Others v. Sub-Inspector

Wilson Siriwardene and Others (2008) 1 Sri.L.R. 260; K.H.G. Kithsiri v Faizer

Musthapha, (S.C.F.R. 362/2017, S.C.M. 10.01.2018); Wanasinghe v. Kamal Paliskara

and Others, (S.C.F.R. 216/2014, S.C.M. 23.06.2021)].

c) A party cannot benefit from the provisions in section 13(1) of the HRCSL Act where

the complaint to the HRCSL is made one month after the alleged violation

[Alagaratnam Manoranjan v. G.A. Chandrasiri, Governor, Northern Province,

(S.C.F.R. 261/2013, S.C.M. 11.09.2014)].

d) The provisions of section 13(1) of the HRCSL are not available to a petitioner who has

made a complaint to the HRCSL only to obtain an advantage by bringing his application

Page 15 of 24

within Article 126(2) of the Constitution [K.H.G. Kithsiri v Faizer Musthapha, (S.C.F.R.

362/2017, SCM 10.01.2018)]

The Respondents claim that the Petitioners have failed to prove that a complaint was

made to the HRCSL within one month from the Petitioners becoming aware of the alleged

infringement.

The Petitioners countered that they became aware of the promotions granted to the 9th

to 41st Respondents and salary increments granted to the 42nd to 65th Respondents, on

or about 15.06.2015 and within one month thereof, they made complaints to the Human

Rights Commission [P27A to P27H].

The 2nd Petitioner complained to the HRCSL on 23.06.2015 against the promotion given

to the 9th Respondent. Thereafter, the 2nd Petitioner received a letter dated 18.01.2016

(CA4) from the HRCSL stating that it transpired during the inquiry held on 28.10.2015 that

an application was pending in the Supreme Court on the same matter. Hence there is

clear evidence that the HRCSL conducted an inquiry into the complaint made by the 2nd

Petitioner.

Similarly, a complaint has been made by the 11th Respondent on 23.06.2015. That is a

complaint made in general on behalf of all the members of the 11th Respondent against

all promotions and salary increments contrary to the scheme of recruitment and

promotion. The HRCSL has by letter dated 30.11.2015 informed that an inquiry into the

complaint will be held on 18.12.2015.

Moreover, the complaint made to the HRCSL by the 6th Petitioner dated 07.07.2015

(P27F) is adequate to overcome the time bar objection.

The complaint makes it clear that the 6th Petitioner was seeking to obtain a remedy in the

interest of all employees of the 1st Respondent who are adversely affected by the alleged

infringement.

Page 16 of 24

This is clearly evident by her answers to the question no. 08 (

) and the question no. 15 (

?) of this application form, which are as follows:

For question no. 08,

.

.

-

For question no. 15,

, ,

By the letter dated 07.07.2015 the HRCSL has informed the 6th Petitioner that her

complaint had been registered under No. HRC/2387/15 and was receiving the attention

of the HRCSL (P27F). Moreover, by letter dated 15.03.2016, the HRCSL has informed 12

complainants including the 6th Petitioner of its inability to proceed further with their

respective complaints, including the aforesaid HRC/2387/15, due to this application

pending in the Supreme Court.

Section 14 of the HRCSL reads as follows:

The Commission may, on its own motion or on a complaint made to it by an

aggrieved person or group of persons or a person acting on behalf of an aggrieved

person or a group of persons, investigate an allegation of the infringement or

imminent infringement of a fundamental right of such person or group of persons

caused-

a) by executive or administrative action; or

Page 17 of 24

b) as a result of an act which constitutes an under the Prevention of

terrorism Act, No. 48 of 1979, committed by any person.

In A.A. Dinesh Priyankara Perera v. 6118, Police Constable & Others [SC FR 260/2011;

01.04.2016 at page 5], Aluwihare, PC, J. held:

Although the two categories, namely a person acting on behalf of an aggrieved

person or a group of persons are not referred to in section 13 (1) of the HRC Act,

I propose to give a purposive interpretation. I am of the view that Section 13 (1)

would be applicable, irrespective of whichever category complains to the HRC.

Hence, I am of the view that the Petitioners can obtain the benefit of the complaints made

to the HRCSL by the 6th and 11th Respondents for the purpose of Sections 13(1) and 14 of

the HRCSL Act. I hasten to add that although a complaint made to the HRCSL by a trade

union will suffice for the purpose of Section 14 of the HRCSL Act, a trade union does not

have locus standi to maintain an application under Article 126(2) of the Constitution

[Development Co-ordinators' Society v. The Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration

and Home Affairs and Others (S.C.F.R. 545/2011, S.C.M. 30.05.2025)].

For the foregoing reasons, I overrule the first preliminary objection on time bar.

It is also apposite to state at this point that the 9th, 11th, 13th and 15th Petitioners have no

locus standi to maintain this application [Development Co-ordinators' Society (supra)].

However, the other Petitioners are entitled to do so [Development Co-ordinators' Society

(supra)].

Necessary Parties

The Respondents submitted that the Minister under whose supervision the 1st

Respondent came should have been made a party. It was contended that the Board of

Directors gave the promotions and the increments based on a direction by the Minister.

Page 18 of 24

However, there is no evidence before us of any such direction by the Minister to the Board

of Directors of the 1st Respondent. The impugned promotions and salary increments have

admittedly been granted by the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent.

In any event, the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent is not legally bound to give

effect to illegal directions of the Minister. They exercise statutory powers vested on them

in terms of the SLBC Act and hold them in trust on behalf of the people of Sri Lanka and

not the Minister or their political masters. Should they fail to exercise their powers and

functions in accordance with the public trust doctrine, a fundamental rights application

can be maintained against them and they can be personally held accountable.

I overrule this preliminary objection.

Suppression or Misrepresentation of Material Facts

The Respondents claim that the Petitioners have failed to disclose that they had received

promotions without being subjected to an interview and without relying on any scheme

of recruitment and promotion, and purely on political patronage of being the members

of the 9th Petitioner Union.

Admittedly, a fundamental rights application is liable to be dismissed in limine where

there has been a suppression or misrepresentation of material facts [Liyanage and Others

v. Ratnasiri, Divisional Secretary, Gampaha and Others (2013) 1 Sri LR 6 at 17; Gas

Conversions (Pvt) Ltd and Others v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Others (SCFR

91/2002); Jahangir Sheriffdeen v. Sandamali Aviruppola, Principal, Visaka Vidyalaya

and Others (SCFR 1/2015, S.C.M. 03.10.2016 at 11); Jayasinghe v. The National Institute

of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering (NIFNE) and Others (2002) 1 Sri LR 277 at 286;

Fernando v. Ranaweera and Others (2002) 1 Sri LR 327 at 328; D.T. Wickramaratne and

Others v. University Grants Commission and Others (SCFR 13/2015, S.C.M. 20.7.2016 at

10); Wickramage Don Subadra v. Kotikawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabhawa and

Page 19 of 24

Others (SCFR 247/2016, S.C.M. 05.08.2024 at 25); Kayleigh Frazer v. Jayawardena and

Others (SCFR 399/2022, S.C.M. 11.05.2023 at 12); Werage Sunil Jayasekera and Others

v. B.A.P. Ariyaratne and Others (SCFR 64/2014, S.C.M. 05.04.2022 at 20)].

A material fact is a fact which the Court is necessarily required to consider by law in

determining the alleged infringement of a fundamental right.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution guarantees equal protection of the law and not equal

violation [Mackie & Co. v. Molagoda (1986) 1 Sri LR 300, 309-313; Gamaethige v.

Siriwardena [1988] 1 Sri LR 384 at 404; Jayasekera v. Wipulasena and Others (1988) 2

Sri LR 237; Jayasuriya v. Vandergert, Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Others

(S.C.F.R., 620/97 S.C.M. 30.10.1998); Dissanayake v. Priyal De Silva (2007) 2 Sri LR 134;

Ceylon Electricity Board v. Hon. Athauda Seneviratne and Others (S.C. Appeal No.

167/2014; S.C.M. 23.05.2025)].

Assuming that the Respondents are correct in asserting that the Petitioners were

beneficiaries of illegal decisions by the previous administrations, that is not a material fact

in determining whether the promotions and salary increments granted to the 9th to 41st

Respondents and the 42nd to 65th Respondents infringe Article 12(1).

Accordingly, I overrule the third preliminary objection.

Analysis of the Merits

The Petitioners submitted that the decision of the 1st to 8th Respondents, or any one or

more of them, to grant promotions to the 9th to 41st Respondents and other employees,

as well as the decision to grant three salary increments to the 42nd to 65th Respondents,

in terms of the Board of Directors' decision No. 3/2015 dated 25.05.2015, is arbitrary,

capricious, unreasonable, without force or effect in law, and violative of the fundamental

rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Page 20 of 24

The Petitioners contended that no applications were called, no interviews were

conducted, and no process was followed to assess whether the promotees possessed the

required qualifications and experience for the posts. Furthermore, they submitted that

the promotions were granted in contravention of the approved scheme of recruitment

and promotion, with some of the promoted posts being newly created and not forming

part of the approved cadre of the 1st Respondent Corporation.

The promotions were made personal to the promotees, overlooking other employees

with higher qualifications and longer service and the salary increments granted to the

42nd to 65th Respondents were also done in an ad hoc manner, contrary to the annual

increment scheme. It was further emphasized that the promotions and salary increments

were granted to office bearers and members of the JSS based solely on their political

affiliations.

In response, the Respondents countered that the Petitioners' case is fundamentally

flawed, as their entire argument hinges on an alleged misapplication or contravention of

the scheme of recruitment and promotion, which, in fact, was not in force at the relevant

time. They further submitted that, in accordance with Section 19(4) and Section 20 of the

SLBC Law, the 1st Respondent Corporation has the discretion to appoint officers and

servants, determine their terms and conditions of service, and fix their remuneration, and

the aforesaid Respondents, who had served long and satisfactorily within the

Corporation, were rightly and lawfully promoted.

Moreover, the aforesaid salary increments, were also lawfully executed in accordance

with the powers of the 1st Respondent and duly documented. In conclusion, the

Respondents submitted that the substantive reliefs sought by the Petitioners to annul the

promotions and increments granted in May 2015 are also rendered academic, as these

decisions were subsequently implemented, and it was not specifically challenged in the

prayer by the Petitioners.

Page 21 of 24

Admittedly, Sections 19(4) and 20 of the SLBC Law empowers the 1st Respondent to

appoint staff of the corporation and to determine their wages and terms and conditions

of employment. Nevertheless, it does not vest unfettered discretion on the Board of

Directors of the 1st Respondent.

In Dr. Athulasiri Kumara Samarakoon and Others v Hon. Ranil Wickremesinghe and

Others (SC FR No. 195/2022, S.C.M. 14.11.2023 at 42), Jayasuriya, PC, CJ. held that:

In its current form the Right to Equality guarantees protection from arbitrary

exercise of power and discretion by State functionaries and enhances the Rule of

Law. It further requires State authorities to ensure that their conduct will not

breach the trust placed on them and ensure that public resources placed in their

custody are protected and preserved for the benefit of the people and not to

exhaust for political or personal benefit. (emphasis added)

The 1st Respondent is a public institution providing an important public service with public

funds. Its recruitment and promotions procedures must be aimed at recruiting persons

replete with most appropriate knowledge, skills and attitudes to the respective positions

in a transparent manner with a view to efficiently maintaining the public service with high

productivity, providing equal opportunities to all those who fulfill required qualifications

to be recruited and career progression. These objectives can be achieved only through

the establishment of a structured scheme of recruitment and promotion incorporating

such objectives.

It is in this context that I must confess of a sense of incredulity that the 1st Respondent

does not have an approved scheme of recruitment and promotion given that it was

established as far back as 1974 and plays a pivotal part in disseminating information to

the public.

As Amerasinghe, J. observed in Perera and Others v. Monetary Board of the Central Bank

of Sri Lanka and Others [(1994) 1 Sri LR 152 at 166]:

[] if society is to be purged of and freed from the related evils of corruption,

nepotism and favouritism, public institutions embarking on executive or

administrative action in terms of Article 126(1) of the Constitution must be clear of

inequalities and/or unevenness. Transparency in recruitment proceedings would go

a long way in achieving public expectations of equal treatment. The selection of a

person must be viewed as a serious matter requiring a thoroughgoing

consideration of the need for the services of an officer, and a clear formulation of

both the basic qualities and qualifications necessary to perform the services, and

the way in which such qualities and qualifications are to be established. In order to

ensure that justice is done and seen to be done, it is at least desirable that cadres,

the criteria for selection, the method of selection and the eventual basis for

selection - for instance by the publication of marks obtained - be made known to

those concerned. Ideally, the whole process from the determination of the cadre to

selection must be easily recognized and seen through, if not obvious. A selection

process veiled in secrecy and not openly avowed and expressed is at least open to

the suspicion of the existence of something evil or wrong. It is of a questionable

character.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution stipulates that, All persons are equal before the law and

are entitled to the equal protection of the law. In W.P.S. Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports

Authority & Others (SCFR Application No. 256/17, S.C.M. 11.12.2020 at 14-15), my

learned brother Kodagoda, PC,J. held:

It is well settled law that, at the core of Article 12 of the Constitution is a key

concept, namely the concept of equality. The concept of equality is founded upon

the premise that, all human beings are born as equals and are free. Equality

Page 23 of 24

confers equal value, equal treatment, equal protection and equitable

opportunities to all persons, independent of or notwithstanding various

demographic, geographic, social, linguistic, religious and political classifications

based on human groupings prevalent in contemporary society, some of which are

immutable or born to and others acquired. (emphasis added)

Article 12(1) seeks to protect persons from arbitrary, unreasonable, malicious and

capricious executive and administrative actions. [Karunathilaka and another v Jayalath

de Silva and others, [2003] 1 Sri LR 35; Ariyawansa and others v. The Peoples Bank and

others, [2006] 2 Sri LR 145; Kanapathipilli v. Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and

Others [2009] 1 Sri LR 406].

The absence of a scheme of recruitment is not a warrant for the Board of Directors of the

1st Respondent to make promotions and grant salary increments based on political

considerations. I have no hesitation in holding that the 9th to 41st Respondents were

granted promotions and the 42nd to 65th Respondents were granted salary increments

personal to them in an arbitrary manner based purely on their political affiliation.

For all the foregoing reasons, I declare that the 1st to 7th Respondents have infringed the

fundamental rights of the 1st to 8th Petitioners guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

I further declare all promotions granted to the 9th to 41st Respondents and all the salary

increments granted to the 42nd to 65th Respondents consequent to the decision of the

Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent on or about 25.05.2015 null and void.

I award the 1st to 8th Petitioners a total of Rs. 4,80,000/= as compensation to be paid by

the 2nd (Nanda Muruththettuwegama), 3rd (Deepika Priyadhsrashani Pieris), 4th (W.

Jayasiri), 5th (Prof. Keerthi Samarasinghe), 6th (Chandrika Kulathilaka), and 7th (E.

Hettiarachchi) Respondents from their personal funds. Hence, each of the 1st to 8th

Petitioners will get Rs. 60,000/= as compensation. Each of the 2nd to 7th Respondents

named above will thus pay Rs. 80,000/= each as compensation from their personal funds.

I direct each of the 2nd to 7th Respondents to make the aforesaid payment to the Registrar

of this Court within 2 months of the delivery of this judgment. The Registrar is directed to

disburse the compensation paid as set out in this judgment.

In the exercise of the just and equitable jurisdiction of this Court, I further direct the 1st

Respondent and the present Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent to forthwith

formulate a Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion to all posts in the 1st Respondent

Corporation with the approval of all the necessary authorities within 6 months of the

delivery of this judgment. The approved Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion should

be filed in the registry with notice to the Petitioners.
