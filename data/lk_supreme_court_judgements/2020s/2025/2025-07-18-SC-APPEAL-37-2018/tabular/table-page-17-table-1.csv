"Interpretation Acts commonly include a provision of the following type:"
"“Where  an  Act  confers  a  power  or  imposes  a  duty,  then,  unless  the  contrary"
"intention appears, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be performed"
"from time to time as occasion requires”"
"Similar  language  can  be  observed  in  Section  12(1)  of  the  UK  Interpretation  Act  1978."
"Section  4  of  the  Interpretation  Ordinance  No.  21  of  1901  as  amended  (Interpretation"
"Ordinance) reads:"
"“Where any enactment or written law, whether passed or made before or after the"
"commencement of this Ordinance, confers a power or imposes a duty, then, unless"
"a contrary intention appears, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be"
"performed from time to time as occasion requires.”"
"Nevertheless, this does not sanction revisiting any administrative or executive decision"
"with a view to revoke or rescind it. On the contrary, it allows the exercise of power from"
"time to time as required."
"In Western Refrigeration (Private) Limited v. State Bank of India [S.C. Appeal 11/2016,"
"S.C.M.  01.06.2017]  it  was  held  that  the  power  conferred  by  section  416  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code is one to which section 4 of the Interpretation Ordinance applies, and"
"may be exercised, from time to time, as the interests of justice require and that the judge"
"is not bound to estimate all likely costs in one attempt."
"In  The  South  Western  Bus  Co.  Ltd.  v.  Arumugam  (48  NLR  385  at  388,  389)  the  Court"
"considered Section 7 of Omnibus Service Licensing Ordinance No. 47 of 1942 in terms of"
"which the Commissioner of Motor Transport has power to issue road service licences from"
"time to time as occasion requires. It was held that the general rule of interpretation is set"
"out in Section 4 of the Interpretation Ordinance which provides that when an Ordinance"
"confers a power or imposes a duty, then, unless a contrary intention appears, the power"
