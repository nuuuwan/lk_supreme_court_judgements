"In Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects [(1989) 2 SCR 848 at 862-63, 62 DLR (4th)"
"577] the Supreme Court of Canada brought clarity to the issue. Sopinka J. (at 861) held:"
"“[T]here is a sound policy reason for recognizing the finality of proceedings before"
"administrative tribunals. As a general rule, once such a tribunal has reached a final"
"decision in respect to the matter that is before it in accordance with its enabling"
"statute,  that  decision  cannot  be  revisited  because  the  tribunal  has  changed  its"
"mind,  made  an  error  within  jurisdiction  or  because  there  has  been  a  change  of"
"circumstances. It can only do so if authorized by statute or if there has been a slip"
"or  error  within  the  exceptions  enunciated  in  Paper  Machinery  Ltd.  v.  J.  O.  Ross"
"Engineering Corp., supra.”"
