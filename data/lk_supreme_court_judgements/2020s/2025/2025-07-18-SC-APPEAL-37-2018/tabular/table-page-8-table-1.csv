"To do otherwise, Vaisey, J argued, would create unacceptable levels of uncertainty, which"
"runs contrary to the rule of law."
"Secondly,  depriving  an  administrative  body  of  such  power  of  revocation,  protects  the"
"interests of the individuals who have acted in reliance on those decisions and who may"
"suffer detriment if the decisions are rescinded or varied."
"Thirdly,  the functus officio doctrine prevents an administrative body from revisiting its"
"decision.  Functus  officio  is  a  Latin  expression  meaning  “having  performed  his  or  her"
"office”. As a concept it has existed from Roman times as evinced  in the edict of Ulpian"
"which was later transposed to Justinian’s Digest. According to Ulpian, a judge ceases to"
"be the judge after he has delivered his judgment “hoc jure utimur ut judex qui semel vel"
"pluris  vel  minoris  condemnavit,  amplius  corrigere  sententiam  suam  non  posset;  semel"
"enim male vel bene officio functus est.”1"
"The doctrine is applicable where a decision is both final and valid. It has been weaved into"
"administrative law in several jurisdictions."
"Canadian lower Courts had applied the functus officio doctrine to administrative tribunals"
"[See Regina v. Development Appeal Board, Ex parte Canadian Industries Ltd (1969), 9"
"DLR (3d) 727, 1969 CanLII 724 (Alta CA)]. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in"
"Grillas  v.  Minister  of  Manpower  and  Immigration  [(1972)  SCR  577,  23  DLR  (3d)  1]"
"somewhat  muddled  as  to  whether  the  doctrine  has  application  in  an  administrative"
"context."
