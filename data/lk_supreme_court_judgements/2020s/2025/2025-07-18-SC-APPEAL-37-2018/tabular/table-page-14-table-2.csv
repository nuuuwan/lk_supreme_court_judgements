"In Regina v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Ex Parte Parker [(1953) 1 WLR 1150]"
"Lord Goddard, CJ held:"
"“[…]  Indeed,  leaving  out  of  account  such  very  exceptional  things  as  irrevocable"
"licences granted under seal and possibly licences coupled with an interest, the very"
"fact  that  a  licence  is  granted  to  a  person  would  seem  to  imply  that  the  person"
"granting the licence can also revoke it. The licence is nothing but a permission, and"
"if one gives a man permission to do something, it is natural that the person who"
"gives the permission will be able to withdraw the permission…”"
