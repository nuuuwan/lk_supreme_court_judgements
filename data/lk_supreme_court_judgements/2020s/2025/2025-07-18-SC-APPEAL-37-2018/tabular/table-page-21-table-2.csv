"power to revisit and rescind or modify it. In Lazarus Estate Ltd. v. Beasley [(1956) 1 QB"
"702], Lord Denning held as follows:"
"""No Court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage he has obtained by"
"fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it"
"has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything. The court is careful not to"
"find fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and proved; but once it is proved it vitiates"
"judgments, contracts and all transactions whatsoever;"""
