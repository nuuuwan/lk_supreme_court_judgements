The Petitioner-Petitioners (Petitioners) complained to the Commissioner General of

Labour (CGOL) that their statutory dues have not been paid. An inquiry was conducted by

U.P.R. Sirinaga, Assistant Commissioner of Labour. Thereafter by letter dated 24.11.2011

a direction was made on the Secretary of the Walkers Covenanted Staff Benefit

Association to pay the private provident fund dues of the Petitioners.

Page 5 of 25

Subsequently the 3rd Respondent-Respondent (3rd Respondent) by letter dated

12.07.2012 sent to the 4th Respondent-Respondent (4th Respondent), copied to the

Petitioners, informed that an inquiry was to be held relating to the complaint of the

Petitioners dated 19.03.2010. The Petitioners attended the said inquiry and sought a

clarification on the scope and purpose of the inquiry. The 3rd Respondent intimated that

it was been held on the instructions of the 2nd Respondent-Respondent (2nd Respondent)

to review his previous decision.

The Petitioners moved the Court of Appeal seeking a writ of Certiorari to quash the

decision to review the previous decision. This application was rejected.

The Court of Appeal held that the 2nd Respondent-Respondent (2nd Respondent) had

decided to continue the inquiry to ascertain the exact position and verify whether the

Petitioners have acted as Directors or as employees of the 4th Respondent and to

ascertain the details of their salary during the relevant time. Court further held that the

first inquiry centered on Employment Provident Fund (EPF) payments and that the

decision on the Gratuity had been made without any proper perusal of documents and

facts.

Moreover, the Court of Appeal held that where material evidence has not been furnished

at the inquiry, the administrative body has the power to continue with the inquiry until it

is satisfied. The Court of Appeal concluded that until the decision is perfected by the filing

of the certificate in the Magistrates Court, any other communication is considered

informal and can be varied.

Leave to appeal has been granted on the following questions of law:

(1) Did the learned judges of the Court of Appeal err in law in failing to consider that

the law does not permit the CGOL/1st to 3rd Respondents to revisit his final order?

Page 6 of 25

(2) Did the learned judges of the Court of Appeal err in law in failing to consider that

upon a final order being delivered by the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd Respondent, the

CGOL is functus and has no further jurisdiction to vary his/her own order?

(3) Did the learned judges of the Court of Appeal err in law in failing to consider the

fact that permitting the CGOL to revisit its order will result in grave uncertainty and

the likelihood of abuse and or that it was in any event repugnant with all norms of

natural justice, fairness and the Rule of Law?

(4) Did the learned judges of the Court of Appeal err in law in confusing the statutory

rights and entitlements of the Petitioners as employees of the 4th Respondent, with

the transactions they entered into in their capacity as Shareholders and or Director

of the 4th Respondent Company?

(5) Did the learned judges of the Court of Appeal err in law in failing to appreciate that

in addition to the admissions of the 1st to the 3rd Respondents, the Petitioners had

tendered documents which established without any doubt the fact that they were

in fact employees of the 4th Respondent Company?

(6) Have the learned judges of the Court of Appeal misdirected themselves in arriving

at a finding that the Petitioners had failed to substantiate the fact that they were

in fact employees of the 4th Respondent Company?

The fundamental issue that arises for determination in this appeal is whether the CGOL

has the power to revisit an order or decision made by him earlier.

Revisiting Administrative Order

There is something innately concerning in holding that a person has the power to revisit

an order or decision he has already made in order to amend, modify or revoke it. This is

an issue which has troubled jurists from the Roman times relating to both judicial and

administrative decisions.

Page 7 of 25

As Voet [Voet Commentarius ad Pandectas at 1.4.21 as translated by Gane The Selective

Voet, Being the Commentary on the Pandects Vol 1 (1955) 90] states:

Yet it would be the course of a wise Emperor to use his best efforts here not to

bring on himself the disgrace of a shameful fickleness and lack of steadfastness in

word and deed by too lightly and rashly revoking and taking away in the evening

the favour which he had given in the morning.

According to Ulpian [Ulpian Digest of Justinian 42.1.55.]:

[Once] a judge has articulated his judgment, he immediately ceases to be the

judge [He] no longer has the capacity to correct the judgment because, for better

or for worse, he will have discharged his duty once and for all.

Most of the arguments against empowering an administrative body to revisit an order or

decision it has made are broadly similar to the arguments against holding a Court having

such power.

Firstly, a general rule that valid and perfected decisions cannot be altered by an

administrative body promotes finality in decision-making. Finality heralds in legal

certainty which Wade [Wade, The Concept of Legal Certainty, A Preliminary Skirmish;

(1941) 4:3 Modern L Rev 183 at 187] identifies as essential to a democratic society

founded on the rule of law. Administrative law roots from the Rule of law. Sprouting from

such roots, certainty, finality, and lawfulness also become inseparable components of

administrative action.

In re 56 Denton Road, Twickenham [(1953) Ch. 51 at 56-57] Vaisey J. held that:

determination made and communicated in terms which are not expressly

preliminary or provisional is final and conclusive, and cannot in the absence of

express statutory power of consent of the person or persons affected be altered or

withdrawn by that body.

Page 8 of 25

To do otherwise, Vaisey, J argued, would create unacceptable levels of uncertainty, which

runs contrary to the rule of law.

Secondly, depriving an administrative body of such power of revocation, protects the

interests of the individuals who have acted in reliance on those decisions and who may

suffer detriment if the decisions are rescinded or varied.

Thirdly, the functus officio doctrine prevents an administrative body from revisiting its

decision. Functus officio is a Latin expression meaning having performed his or her

office. As a concept it has existed from Roman times as evinced in the edict of Ulpian

which was later transposed to Justinians Digest. According to Ulpian, a judge ceases to

be the judge after he has delivered his judgment hoc jure utimur ut judex qui semel vel

pluris vel minoris condemnavit, amplius corrigere sententiam suam non posset; semel

enim male vel bene officio functus est.1

The doctrine is applicable where a decision is both final and valid. It has been weaved into

administrative law in several jurisdictions.

Canadian lower Courts had applied the functus officio doctrine to administrative tribunals

[See Regina v. Development Appeal Board, Ex parte Canadian Industries Ltd (1969), 9

DLR (3d) 727, 1969 CanLII 724 (Alta CA)]. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in

Grillas v. Minister of Manpower and Immigration [(1972) SCR 577, 23 DLR (3d) 1]

somewhat muddled as to whether the doctrine has application in an administrative

context.

1 Alexandr Koptev, Digestae Justinian The Latin Library at Book 42, Title 1, Note 55, online: <www.thelatinlibrary.com/justinian/digest42.shtml>

Page 9 of 25

In Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects [(1989) 2 SCR 848 at 862-63, 62 DLR (4th)

577] the Supreme Court of Canada brought clarity to the issue. Sopinka J. (at 861) held:

[T]here is a sound policy reason for recognizing the finality of proceedings before

administrative tribunals. As a general rule, once such a tribunal has reached a final

decision in respect to the matter that is before it in accordance with its enabling

statute, that decision cannot be revisited because the tribunal has changed its

mind, made an error within jurisdiction or because there has been a change of

circumstances. It can only do so if authorized by statute or if there has been a slip

or error within the exceptions enunciated in Paper Machinery Ltd. v. J. O. Ross

Engineering Corp., supra.

The South African courts have also adopted the functus officio doctrine to prevent an

administrative body from revisiting its decision.

In Sachs v. Dnges, NO [(1950) 2 SA 265(AD)] it was held by reference to this doctrine

that a passport once granted cannot be revoked. In Welgemoed and Another NNO v The

Master and Another [(1976) 1 SA 513 (T)] it was held that uncertainty should be

eliminated, so that the persons concerned can safely act upon the decision, at least until

such time as it is set aside on appeal or review. In Merafong City Local Municipality v.

AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. [(2017) 2 SA 211 (CC)] the Constitutional Court (per Cameron J.

at para. 41) held that the validity of a decision has to be tested in appropriate proceedings.

The sole power to pronounce that the decision is defective, and therefore invalid, lies

with the courts. Government itself has no authority to invalidate or to ignore the decision.

It remains legally effective until set aside.

This doctrine has been applied in Sri Lanka as well. In Nadaraja Limited v. Krishnadasan

(78 NLR 255) the question arose whether the Minister can revoke an order made by him

under Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act referring an industrial dispute for

settlement by arbitration to an Arbitrator appointed by him. It was held that the order of

Page 10 of 25

reference is an administrative act of the Minister and once he has made the order of

reference, the Minister becomes functus [See In Re The Acting General Manager,

Electrical Undertakings, Colombo (74 NLR 452); Piyadasa v. Bata Shoe Co. (1982) 1 Sri

LR 91; Chandananda De Silva, Commissioner of Elections and Another v. George Ivan

Appuhamy and Others (1993) 2 Sri LR 401; Right to Information Commission and

Another v. Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (CA Appeal/Application No. CA/RTI/05/2022, C.A.M.

02.11.2023)].

Fourthly, Akehurst [Akehurst, Revocation of Administrative Decisions (1982) PL 613 at

623-624 as referred in Beatson, Matthew, and Elliots, Administrative Law : Texts and

Materials (3rd Ed., Oxford University Press, 2005) 201], distinguishes two sets of

circumstances. He takes the view that where an administrative body is empowered to

determine pre-existing legal rights, it is performing the same type of function as a court

performs. Just as judicial decisions are final and irrevocable, so too should be those

administrative decisions that function similarly. Parliament intends for the administrative

body to enjoy some degree of irrevocability of judgements when such authority is

entrusted in the particular body. This alignment reinforces the legitimacy and dignity of

administrative processes and secures individual rights from arbitrary alteration.

Fifthly, the presumption of validity negates empowering an administrative body the

power to revoke, amend or vary its decision.

According to the presumption of validity, administrative action is presumed to be valid

unless or until it is set aside by a court [Hoffmann-La Roche and Co. v. Secretary of State

for Trade & Industry (1975) A.C. 295].

Denning L.J. took a different view in MacFoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [(1961) 3 All E.R.

1169 at 1172] in holding that You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay

there, it will collapse.

Page 11 of 25

This was contrary to the earlier position expounded by Radcliffe L.J. in Smith v. East Elloe

Rural District Council [(1956) A.C. 736, 769-770] where he held:

An order, even if not made in good faith is still an act capable of legal

consequences. It bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead. Unless the

necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to

get it quashed or otherwise upset, it will remain as effective for its ostensible

purpose as the most impeccable of orders.

However, Wade and Forsyth (Administrative Law, 9th Ed., Indian Edition, 305), states that

the statement of Denning L.J. in Mcfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd.(supra) is not the correct

position in law.

I had the occasion to examine this issue in greater detail in McCallum Brewing Company

(Private) Limited v. Commissioner General of Excise and Another [C.A. Writ 469/2008,

C.A.M. 18.12.2019] and Weerasooriya v. Wijeweera, Director General of Customs and

Others [C.A. (Writ) 259/2014, C.A.M. 22.06.2020] and adopted the view taken in Smith

(supra). I see no reason to take a different position now [See Durayappah v. Fernando

(1967) 2 AC 337; Hoffman-La Roche (supra. at pages 365-6) per Lord Diplock; Forbes v.

New South Wales Trotting Club (1979) 25 ALR 1, 30 per Aickin J; London and Clydeside

Estates Ltd v. Aberdeen District Council (1980) 1 WLR 182, 189-190 per Lord Hailsham;

Calvin v. Carr (1980) AC 574, 589-90 ; R v. Panel on Take-Overs and Mergers; Ex Parte

Datafin plc (1987) QB 815, 840 per Lord Donaldson MR; Wattmaster Alco Pty Ltd v.

Button (1986) 70 ALR 330; Martin v. Ryan (1990) 2 NZLR 209, 235-41 (Ryan, J.)].

Lewis [Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th ed., South Asia Edition (2017)] in

discussing the meaning of null and void in administrative law states (at page 185):

The concept of nullity has been used to solve other problem arising in

administrative law. For remedial purposes, the orthodox view is that an ultra vires

Page 12 of 25

act is regarded as void and a nullity. An act by a public authority which lacks legal

authority is regarded as incapable of producing legal effects. Once its illegality is

established, and if the courts are prepared to grant a remedy, the act will be

regarded as void from its inception and retrospectively nullified in the sense that it

will be regarded as ever incapable of ever producing legal effects. (emphasis

added)

Thus, even where an act of a public authority is ultra vires and a nullity, for remedial

purposes the illegality must be established before a court. As Wade and Forsyth (supra.

at 281) states:

the court will treat an administrative act or order invalid only if the right remedy

is sought by the right person in the right proceedings

Wade and Forsyth (supra. at page 304) goes on to state as follows:

This must be equally true even where the brand of invalidity is plainly visible for

there also the order can effectively be resisted in law only by obtaining the decision

of the court. The necessity of recourse to the court has been pointed out

repeatedly in the House of Lords and Privy Council, without distinction between

patent and latent defects. Lord Diplock spoke still more clearly [Hoffmann-La

Roche & Co. v. Secretary of State for Trade & Industry (1975) A.C. 295 at 366],

saying that

it leads to confusion to use such terms as voidable, voidable ab initio, void or

a nullity as descriptive of the status of subordinate legislation alleged to be ultra

vires for patent or for latent defects, before its validity has been pronounced on

by a court of competent jurisdiction. (emphasis added)

Page 13 of 25

This presumption of validity exists pending a final decision by Court [Lord Hoffmann in R

v. Wicks (1998) A.C. 92 at 115, Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in Boddington v. British

Transport Police (1999) 2 A.C. 143 at 156 and 161, and 173-4].

Notwithstanding the vigor and rationality of these arguments, there are similar

arguments in favour of recognizing the right of an administrative body to revisit an order

or decision made by it.

Firstly, it is in the public interest to avoid litigation [Comptroller-General of Customs v.

Kawasaki Motors Pty Ltd. (1991) 103 ALR 661, 671 and 667]. The valuable resources of

courts bursting at the seam with huge back log of cases need not be wasted where there

is an obvious mistake in the decision of an administrative body. [See R (on the application

of Chaudhuri) v. General Medical Council (2015) EWHC 6621(Admin)].

Secondly, there is a broad corrective principle which allows public bodies to correct their

decisions based on a fundamental mistake of fact [Porteous v. West Dorset District

Council (2004) EWCA Civ 244; Fajemisin v. General Medical Council (2013) EWHC 3501

(Admin); R (on the application of Chaudhuri) v. General Medical Council (supra)].

In R (on the application of Chaudhuri) v. General Medical Council [(2015) EWHC 6621] it

was held that a local authority had power to revisit and rescind an earlier decision based

on a fundamental mistake of fact. Here, the Court propounded that, public bodies have

an implied power themselves to revisit and revoke any decision vitiated by a fundamental

mistake as to the underlying facts upon which the decision in question was based. It

adopted the rationale of Porteous v. West Dorset District Council (supra) in arriving at

this conclusion. It further, provided that this implied power arose from S.12(1) of the

Interpretation Act of the UK.

Page 14 of 25

Thirdly, Akehurst [supra] is of the view that where an administrative body is empowered

to confer an individual benefit which he would not otherwise have possessed, there is an

implied discretion to revoke such decisions. However, in exercising such discretion, the

public body must carefully weigh the competing interests and revoke the decision only

where public interests in favour outweigh the private interests of the beneficiary.

In Regina v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Ex Parte Parker [(1953) 1 WLR 1150]

Lord Goddard, CJ held:

[] Indeed, leaving out of account such very exceptional things as irrevocable

licences granted under seal and possibly licences coupled with an interest, the very

fact that a licence is granted to a person would seem to imply that the person

granting the licence can also revoke it. The licence is nothing but a permission, and

if one gives a man permission to do something, it is natural that the person who

gives the permission will be able to withdraw the permission

These competing interests have been examined by Courts from different jurisdictions. As

a result it is possible to identify certain specific grounds on which an administrative body

may revisit its decision. They are:

(1) Unperfected Decisions

The general rule is that judgments can be changed before perfection. Similarly,

administrative decisions not perfected can be revoked or varied.

Perfecting simply means, a judgment or an administrative decision being made final.

There are varying opinions on when exactly a judgment can be considered perfected

[See L and B (Children) [2013] UKSC 8; Jowett v Bradford (Earl) [1977] ICR 342; Lamont

v. Frys Metals Ltd. (1985) ICR 566].

Page 15 of 25

The requirements to perfect a decision depends on the relevant legislation. Where the

applicable legislation does not prescribe any particular mode for perfecting a decision,

the general rule is that the decision is perfected once it is communicated to the party to

whom the decision relates [See Jowett (supra); R v. Greater Manchester Valuation Panel;

Ex parte Shell Chemicals (UK) Ltd (1981) 3 WLR 752; R v. Criminal Injuries Compensation

Board; Ex parte Tong (1976) 1 WLR 1237(CA)].

The crucial point is that the decision should have been communicated in a way to indicate

that it is not a merely provisional or tentative [See Re 56 Denton Road (supra); Gunnedah

Municipal Council v. White (1966) 13 LGRA 336; Holmes v. Ryde Municipal Council

(1969) 90 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 290].

However, even where a decision is taken in principle and conveyed, it may be regarded

as the final effective decision [AG v. Bristva Pty Ltd. (1964-5) NSWR 439; Wattle Park Pty

Ltd v. Commissioner of Highways (1973) 6 SASR 69; Foote v. Brown (1977) 35 LGRA 146

(SC NSW)].

The characterisation of the decision is irrelevant. An interim decision may be still be

regarded for specific purposes to be a perfected and operative decision [See The Broken

Hill Pty Co v. American Can Co. (1980) VR 143; R v. Smith; Ex Pate Mole Engineering Pty

Ltd. (1981) 35 ALR 119 (HC)].

Australian courts have identified two elements that need to be satisfied to perfect a

judgment. They suggest that a judgment is perfected once the decision maker has i)

engaged in the mental process of reaching a conclusion and ii) there has been an objective

manifestation of the conclusion [See Pintarich v. Deputy Commissioner of Taxation

(2018) 262 FCR 41; Semunigus v. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs

(2000) 96 FCR 533].

Page 16 of 25

Accordingly, inadvertently rendered decisions, such as decisions generated by computer

programs would not satisfy the mental element. Furthermore, according to these cases,

objective manifestation of the decision is satisfied when the decision is either

communicated to one of the parties (usually to the applicant), or when the decision is

published by delivering the reasons and recording them in the Registry [See Semunigus

(supra)].

Hence the minimum threshold for perfecting a decision seems to be the formal

communication of the decision to one or more of the parties. A decision which is not so

perfected can be revisited.

(2) Express Statutory Power

Express statutory power to revisit decisions is conferred for a variety of purposes. For

example, to enable correction of clerical slips and accidental errors in or omissions from

written determinations, to enable other errors to be rectified, to permit new evidence

not previously available to be considered, to permit decisions which have a continuing

effect to be revised in the light of changed circumstances, or simply to allow for

reassessment of claims [See Campbell, Enid, Revocation and Variation of Administrative

Decisions, (1996) 22(1) Monash University Law Review 30].

(3) Implied Statutory Power

Unless there are express provisions to the contrary, or stating a different way a decision

should be revisited, decision-makers can exercise an implied power to reconsider

decisions. They can exercise such power as an ancillary duty arising out of express

statutory terms that affect the decision, and also through constructions of provisions in

Interpretation Acts.

Page 17 of 25

Interpretation Acts commonly include a provision of the following type:

Where an Act confers a power or imposes a duty, then, unless the contrary

intention appears, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be performed

from time to time as occasion requires

Similar language can be observed in Section 12(1) of the UK Interpretation Act 1978.

Section 4 of the Interpretation Ordinance No. 21 of 1901 as amended (Interpretation

Ordinance) reads:

Where any enactment or written law, whether passed or made before or after the

commencement of this Ordinance, confers a power or imposes a duty, then, unless

a contrary intention appears, the power may be exercised and the duty shall be

performed from time to time as occasion requires.

Nevertheless, this does not sanction revisiting any administrative or executive decision

with a view to revoke or rescind it. On the contrary, it allows the exercise of power from

time to time as required.

In Western Refrigeration (Private) Limited v. State Bank of India [S.C. Appeal 11/2016,

S.C.M. 01.06.2017] it was held that the power conferred by section 416 of the Civil

Procedure Code is one to which section 4 of the Interpretation Ordinance applies, and

may be exercised, from time to time, as the interests of justice require and that the judge

is not bound to estimate all likely costs in one attempt.

In The South Western Bus Co. Ltd. v. Arumugam (48 NLR 385 at 388, 389) the Court

considered Section 7 of Omnibus Service Licensing Ordinance No. 47 of 1942 in terms of

which the Commissioner of Motor Transport has power to issue road service licences from

time to time as occasion requires. It was held that the general rule of interpretation is set

out in Section 4 of the Interpretation Ordinance which provides that when an Ordinance

confers a power or imposes a duty, then, unless a contrary intention appears, the power

Page 18 of 25

may be exercised and the duty shall be performed from time to time as occasion requires

and that this section would give the Commissioner the power to issue licences from time

to time unless the legislature has expressed a contrary intention in Section 7 (1).

(4) Fundamental Mistake of Fact

There is clear authority that a decision based upon a fundamental mistake of fact can be

corrected by an administrative or executive body.

In Rootkin v. Kent County Council [(1981) 1 W.L.R. 1186] it was held that where a local

authority issued a season ticket under a mistake of fact, it was duty bound to reconsider

the matter when it was found that a mistake about the distance had been made. This was

a fundamental mistake of fact as the eligibility for a seasons ticket depended on the

distance between the school and the house of the applicant. [See R v. Newham LBC, ex

parte Begum [1996] 28 HLR, 646 at 656; Crawley BC v. B [2000] EWCA Civ 50; R v.

Bradford Crown Court, ex parte Crossling [2000] COD 107; R v. Inner London North

Coroner, ex parte Touche [2001] EWCA Civ 383 at [36]; R(Zahid Hafeez) v. Secretary of

State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 1342 (Admin) at [25]-[37]].

In Porteous v. West Dorset District Council [(2004) EWCA Civ 244] the question was

whether the local housing authority was entitled to revisit and change an earlier decision

if the earlier decision resulted from a fundamental mistake of fact. Mantell, J. held (at

para. 9) as follows:

It would seem surprising if it could not. If an exception may be made for fraud why

not for fundamental mistake? After all the resulting harm may be no greater in the

one case than the otherOnce the true position became known why in

commonsense and justice should the local authority be held to a duty to provide

accommodation which the applicant does not need and which could be made

available in another more deserving case?... Accordingly, whilst I recognise that

Page 19 of 25

there may well be a distinction to be made between circumstances prevailing at

the time of the decision and changes occurring thereafter, I would hold that the

judge was right to find that the local authority had been entitled to revisit and

rescind its first decision.

This position was subsequently affirmed by Sedley LJ in Fajemisin v. The General Dental

Council [(2013) EWHC 3501].

The circumstances under which an administrative decision may be reviewed on the basis

of a fundamental mistake of fact was laid down in E v Secretary of State for the Home

Department [(2004) EWCA Civ 49]. However, in view of the order I propose to make in

this appeal, there is no need to examine them.

Our courts have recognized the power of an administrative or executive body to revisit its

earlier decision. The source of such power is Section 18 of the Interpretation Ordinance

which reads as follows:

"Where by enactment whether passed before or after the commencement of this

Ordinance, confers power on any authority to issue any proclamation, order or any

notification so issued or made may be at any time amended varied rescinded or

revoked by the same authority and in the same manner, and subject to the like

consent and conditions, if any, or by or in which or subject to which such

proclamation, order or notification may be issued or made."

In James Perera v. Government Agent Kandy (46 NLR 287) Court held, by reference to

corresponding Section 15 of the Interpretation Ordinance then, that a Government Agent

who is authorized to issue notices for a nomination and election of members to Village

Committees has power to cancel the notices and issue fresh notices.

In Silva v. Attorney General (60 NLR 145 at 151) Basnayake, C.J. observed as follows:

In the instant case, as stated above the Public Service Commission was free to

revoke its delegation by order published in the Government Gazette by virtue of

section 15 of the Interpretation Ordinance (present section 18) although the

empowering section itself, as in the case of the English Statute referred to in the

case of Huth V. Clark (supra), does not confer a power to revoke a delegation once

made.

In Hon. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Others v. Archbishop of Colombo [S.C. Appeal

54/2017, S.C.M. 22.06.2018, page 8] Malalgoda, PC, J. held that that the provisions of

section 18 of the Interpretation Ordinance applies only when the enabling statute

contains the power to issue a proclamation or to make any order or notification without

a corresponding power to amend, vary, rescind or revoke them.

Nevertheless, Section 18 of the Interpretation Ordinance does not vest unfettered power

to revisit any administrative or executive decision already made. There are no such

powers in a modern democratic society. In my view, Section 18 permits any administrative

or executive body to revisit its earlier decision only where the decision was made on a

fundamental mistake of fact and that also only after giving a fair hearing.

In Vasana v. Incorporated Council of Legal Education and Others [(2004) 1 Sri.L.R. 154]

the petitioner sat the Law College Entrance Examination and was informed that her

admission has been provisionally approved for registration and was also directed to

deposit a sum of money to the credit of the Council of Legal Education. Later the Council

had informed her that due to an error, her marks had been entered as 70 when it was in

fact 56, and as the cut off mark was 70, she is not qualified for admission. The application

of the petitioner for a writ of mandamus directing that she be admitted was rejected.

Although the reasoning is that she did not have a legitimate expectation of being

Page 21 of 25

admitted, the decision also supports the ability of an administrative body to revoke its

earlier decision based on a fundamental mistake of fact.

In Shihar and Others v. Commissioner General of Labour and Others [C.A. (Writ)

152/2018, C.A.M. 16.11.2020, page 11] and Samarasekera v. Wijeyaratne and Others

[C.A. (Writ) Application No. 332/2015, C.A.M. 10.03.2021, page 35] my learned brother

Obeyesekere, J. acknowledged the power to revisit an administrative order made under

a fundamental mistake of fact.

(5) Fraud

Where an administrative decision has been obtained by fraud, the decision maker has the

power to revisit and rescind or modify it. In Lazarus Estate Ltd. v. Beasley [(1956) 1 QB

702], Lord Denning held as follows:

"No Court in this land will allow a person to keep an advantage he has obtained by

fraud. No judgment of a court, no order of a Minister, can be allowed to stand if it

has been obtained by fraud. Fraud unravels everything. The court is careful not to

find fraud unless it is distinctly pleaded and proved; but once it is proved it vitiates

judgments, contracts and all transactions whatsoever;"

Let me recapitulate the principles expounded above. Generally, a decision made by an

administrative or executive body cannot be rescinded or varied by the very same body

which made the decision. However, it is possible to do so where there is:

(a) express power, or

(b) implied power, or

(c) where the decision is unperfected; or

(d) the decision was made on a fundamental mistake of fact; or

(e) the decision was obtained by fraud.

Page 22 of 25

In any of the circumstances outlined in (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above, the decision maker

can revisit the earlier order and revoke or modify it after giving a fair hearing.

Powers of the CGOL

Section 8 of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983 as amended (Act) empowers the

CGOL to issue a certificate to the relevant Magistrates Court in order to recover any sum

due as gratuity. This can be done only after due inquiry.

Learned State Counsel submitted that the inquiry culminates with the filing of a certificate

in the Magistrates Court. I am unable to accede to this proposition. A defaulter who is

willing to pay the amount determined by the CGOL after inquiry is then deprived of an

opportunity to do so out of Court. I hold that the decision of the CGOL in an inquiry

conducted in terms of Section 8 of the Act is perfected upon a written intimation of it

being made to the defaulter. The Act does not contain any express power on the CGOL to

revisit the perfected decision. Neither is there any implied power.

Hence, the only grounds on which that decision can be revisited is if the decision was

made on a fundamental mistake of fact or the decision was obtained by fraud. No

allegation of fraud is made by the Respondents. The factual matrix does not reveal that

there is any fundamental mistake of fact in making the impugned decision.

On 21.12.2009, the 1st Petitioner wrote to the CEO of MTD Walkers PLC (MTD) with copy

to CGOL of the non-payment of his EPF and gratuity. On 19.03.2010, the 2nd Petitioner

wrote to the CGOL confirming that he too was not paid the EPF and gratuity by MTD.

The CGOL wrote to MTD on 19.03.2010 informing that an inquiry will be held on

21.04.2010. The inquiry was on both outstanding EPF and gratuity. On that day inquiry

commenced and MTD was represented by Head of Administration and an Attorney-at-

Law. They were told to report on the documents on payment of wages and period of

service.

Page 23 of 25

Sometime later both MTD and 4th Respondent had taken part in the inquiry. On

14.07.2010 all parties tendered written submissions. On 21.07.2010, the inquiry took

place with the participation of the Petitioners and 4th Respondent who claimed that it

was not liable to pay the EPF and gratuity as it was the obligation of the earlier Directors.

During the inquiry, the 4th Respondent never disputed that the EPF and gratuity is due to

the Petitioners. The only point made was that it is the Petitioners themselves, as Directors

of the 4th Respondent during the relevant period, who are liable to make the payment.

Ostensibly, this contention appears to be founded upon Section 40 of the Employees

Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 as amended. It may well provide a defense to the

present Directors of the 4th Respondent during any proceedings in the Magistrates Court.

However, it does not prevent the CGOL from arriving at a finding that the 4th Respondent

has failed to pay the Petitioners their EPF and gratuity.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that there is no fundamental mistake of fact in the

impugned decision. Hence, the CGOL has no power to revisit it with a view to varying or

revoking it.

I answer the questions of law as follows:

(1) Did the learned judges of the Court of Appeal err in law in failing to consider that

the law does not permit the CGOL/1st to 3rd Respondents to revisit his final order?

The CGOL may revisit a decision made by him where the decision was made on a

fundamental mistake of fact or the decision was obtained by fraud. In the

present case, the decision was not based on a fundamental mistake of fact.

Neither was it obtained by fraud.

Page 24 of 25

(2) Did the learned judges of the Court of Appeal err in law in failing to consider that

upon a final order being delivered by the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd Respondent, the

CGOL is functus and has no further jurisdiction to vary his/her own order?

The CGOL may revisit a decision made by him where the decision was made on a

fundamental mistake of fact or the decision was obtained by fraud.

In view of the answers given to the above questions of law, there is no need to answer

the other questions of law.

I set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 13.02.2017.

For the reasons more fully expounded above, I issue a:

(a) Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision reflected in P10 to commence an

inquiry again into the impugned matters;

(b) Writ of Prohibition prohibiting and/or restraining the Commissioner

General of Labour and/or 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd Respondents from

conducting any further inquiry in respect of matters already determined in

the letter dated 8th March 2012 marked P7 and/or in respect of matters

arising from the Petitioners complaint marked P2 and P2(a) and/or from

varying and/or revising and/or cancelling the said order and/or

determination contained in letter dated 8th March 2012 marked P7;

(c) Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd Respondents to

take immediate steps to promptly institute appropriate action to recover on

behalf of the Petitioners the sums awarded by the determination contained

in letter dated 8th March 2012 marked P12.
