Having granted Leave to Appeal, with the concurrence of learned Counsel for both parties, the Court proceeded to take up the Appeal for hearing. Accordingly, the learned counsel for the Appellant and the learned counsel for the Respondent were heard. During the hearing, the Court considered the evidence in this case, as well as the impugned judgment of the High Court. We have noted with some degree of concern the final paragraph of the impugned judgment of the High Court, wherein the learned Judge has arrived at findings against both the Applicant-Appellant and the Respondent-Respondent before that Court. It is the understanding of this Court that, given the facts of this case, the Court exercising Appellate jurisdiction being the High Court, could not have arrived at such counter findings, which in the circumstances of this matter, renders the judgment meaningless. The learned Judge of the High Court having arrived at a finding either in favour or against the Appellant should have definitively and with clarity, either rejected or accepted the Appeal presented by the Applicant \u2013 Appellant. If in fact the position presented on behalf of the Applicant \u2013 Appellant and the Respondent \u2013 Respondent had to be rejected for good reason, the learned Judge should have recorded in the Judgment the correct position and determined the Appeal based on such correct position. In this instance, the learned Judge of the High Court has not done that either. In the circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the learned Judge of the High Court has failed to properly adjudicate the Appeal before him. It is necessary to note that coherence and clarity are core features of a Judgment. Sadly, the impugned judgment lacks both. Therefore, the question of law in respect of which Leave to Appeal was granted is answered in the following manner:",
