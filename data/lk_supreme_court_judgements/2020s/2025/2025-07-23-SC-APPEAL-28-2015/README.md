Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action on 26.08.2004 in the District Court of

Tissamaharama seeking a declaration that he is entitled to possess the land

in accordance with Grant No. //26102 dated 14.10.1996 marked P1,

issued under the Land Development Ordinance (

//26102

), the ejectment of the defendants therefrom, and damages.

The defendants prayed for the dismissal of the plaintiffs action.

According to Grant P1, the plaintiff is entitled to possess the land bounded

on the north by the land of Pandula, on the east by the land of Ariyasena,

on the south by the land of Bandupala, and on the west by the road

reservation leading to the Manik River, in extent of one acre. This is the

same land described in the schedule to the plaint.

SC/APPEAL/28/2015

However, at the time of issuance of the Grant or at any time thereafter,

possession of the said parcel of land had not been delivered to the plaintiff

by demarcating its boundaries through a survey plan.

For the purposes of the case, Plan No. 50755 marked X was prepared. This

Plan depicts a land in extent of 2 Acres, 2 Roods, and 17 Perchesan extent

which exceeds that described in the Grant by 1 Acre, 2 Roods, and 17

Perches.

In other words, notwithstanding that the Grant conferred only one acre, the

plaintiff now lays claim to a substantially larger extent of land.

Even three months prior to the institution of this action, the Divisional

Secretary, by letter dated 17.05.2004 marked V3, informed the plaintiff that

he is entitled only to a land extent of one acre in terms of the Grant, and

nothing more.

.. 26102 1 .

,

.

This clearly demonstrates that the plaintiff was aware of the actual extent

granted to him, yet he proceeded to claim a substantially larger portion,

contrary to the contents of the Grant.

It is significant to note that the plaintiff did not make the Divisional

Secretary a party to the action. However, the officer from the Divisional

Secretariat who was called by the defendant to give evidence confirmed that

the plaintiff had been granted only one acre of land.

After trial, the learned District Judge, by judgment dated 17.12.2009, held

that the plaintiff is entitled to possess one acre of land from the northern

4

SC/APPEAL/28/2015

boundary of the land depicted in Plan marked X. The learned Judge further

ordered the ejectment of the defendant and her subordinates from the said

portion, together with costs.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Court, the plaintiff

preferred an appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal of Tangalle. The High

Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court, subject to the

amendment that the entire land depicted in Plan marked X, in extent of 2

Acres, 2 Roods, and 17 Perches, forms part of the land described in the

Grant.

It is from this judgment of the High Court that the defendant has preferred

the present appeal. A previous Bench of this Court granted leave to appeal

against the judgment of the High Court on several questions of law, all of

which are encompassed by the first question, whether the said judgment

is erroneous and contrary to law.

The plaintiff has also raised a question of law, contending that he is entitled

to be restored to possession of the entire land depicted in Plan X, on the

basis that he instituted a possessory action under section 4 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

However, in his written submissions dated 20.06.2016, filed after leave to

appeal was granted, the plaintiff categorically stated in paragraph 13 that

the plaintiffs action is not a possessory action, but a rei vindicatio action.

The plaintiff cannot be permitted to change the character of the action from

time to time.

On the facts and circumstances of this case, it is clear that the plaintiff was

granted only one acre of land under Grant P1. The plaintiff sought a

declaration that he is entitled to possess the land in accordance with the

said Grant. It must be emphasised that the plaintiff does not assert any

5

SC/APPEAL/28/2015

claim to the excess portion depicted in Plan X on the basis of prescription

or any other legal ground.

Accordingly, I hold that the amendment made by the High Court to the

judgment of the District Court, extending it to cover the entire land depicted

in Plan X, is unsustainable in fact and in law.

I answer the question of law raised by the plaintiff in the affirmative, and

that of the defendant in the negative. The judgment of the High Court is

accordingly set aside, and the judgment of the District Court is restored.

The plaintiff is entitled to costs.
