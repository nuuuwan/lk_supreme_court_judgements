Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The petitioners in both these Fundamental Rights Applications allege that

their fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) and/or Article

14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been infringed and/or continued to be

infringed by the actions of one or more respondents named in their petition;

and seeks redress as prayed for in their respective petitions.

The Fundamental Rights Application No. SC/FRA/402/2019 has been

instituted on 24-10-2019, while SC/FRA/429/2019 has been instituted on

08-11-2019.

When both these applications were supported together by the learned

Presidents Counsel who represented the petitioners, having considered the

relevant facts and the circumstances, this Court granted Leave to Proceed

on 25-10-2020 in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution against all the

respondents named in their respective applications.

At the hearing of this application, all parties agreed for a common judgment

since the facts, circumstances and the reliefs sought were identical.

This Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners

and that of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) for the respondents.

This Court also had the benefit of considering the written submissions

tendered in determining the applications.

The facts that led to these applications can be summarized in the following

manner.

All the petitioners are retired police officers of Sri Lanka Police Service, who

held different ranks at the time of their retirement.

The petitioners belong to a group of police officers who sustain injuries on

various occasions due to terrorist activities while performing their official

duties. After their recovery from the said injuries, they have earned

promotions within the ranks as serving police officers.

Page 22 of 29

However, the petitioners being subsequently adjudged medically incapable

of serving or continuing to serve in Sri Lanka Police due to their physical

impairments and disabilities suffered during the separatist war, they have

been sent on retirement on the recommendations made by a Medical Board

appointed for that purpose.

According to the contents of the petition, the petitioners, having been sent

on retirement, had become entitled to the following benefits in terms of Sri

Lanka Administrative Circular 21/88 dated 13-07-1988.

a. Monthly salary up to the attainment of age 55 computed on the

basis of the last drawn salary.

b. Monthly payable pension as at the date of retirement calculated on

the basis of the last drawn salary.

The petitioners state that they were made aware that a policy decision had

been made by the government of Sri Lanka in pursuance to a decision by a

Cabinet of Ministers to, Grant promotions to male and female police officers

of the police rendered disabled due to LTTE acts of terrorism.

The petitioners are seeking to challenge the aforementioned Cabinet

decision, on the basis that it led to discriminatory promotions, where police

officers with less seniority in their ranks to that of the petitioners were

promoted ahead of them, and thereby treating the equals unequally.

In paragraph 05 of SC/FRA/402/2019, the petitioners have pleaded the

following;

5. The petitioners therefore, by this application is seeking the

intervention of Your Lordships Court to remedy the said serious

inequities which had been caused to the petitioners as a direct result

of the said impugned Cabinet decision and to grant promotions to

male and female police officers of the Sri Lank Police rendered

disabled/ medically condemned due to LTTE acts of terrorism and

backdating the said promotions to the date of said injury (the

emphasis is mine).

Page 23 of 29

The corresponding paragraph 07 of SC/FRA/429/2019 reads as follows;

7. The petitioners therefore, by this application is seeking the

intervention of Your Lordships Court to remedy the said serious

inequities which has been caused to these petitioners as a direct

result of not granting any relief whatsoever, in pursuance to the

impugned Cabinet decision and also by the conduct of the state to

treat equals unequally in the manner morefully pleaded herein in

detailed, thus violating and/or continuing to violate the rights of these

petitioners (the emphasis is mine).

It is therefore manifestly clear from the contents of the petitions that the

petitioners have come before this Court on the basis of violation of their

fundamental rights as a result of a Cabinet decision by the Cabinet of

Ministers to grant promotions to police officers rendered disabled due to the

acts of terrorism as stated earlier.

The relevant Cabinet Memorandum No. 10/2015 dated 26-03-2015 has

been presented by the Subject Minister having considered the necessity to

grant special relief to those police officers who had received injuries due to

terrorist activities, proposing and recommending several reliefs. (The

document marked P-05).

For better understanding of the scheme of reliefs, I will now reproduce the

said recommendations in its full, which reads thus;

1. .... 2014.05.18

2014.05.18

/ ,

2. /

,

3.

Page 24 of 29

(1,2,3)

/ (

) 348 . (...)

4. 2009.05.18 ,

5. 2009.05.18

,

.

The petitioners position is that they fall into to the 2nd group of police

officers as detailed in the petition.

The document marked P-06 along with the petition, which is the relevant

Cabinet decision in relation to the above Cabinet Memorandum, shows that

the Cabinet of Ministers have decided to implement the said

recommendations at the Cabinet meeting held on 23-05-2017. It has been

decided to grant approval to the previous Cabinet Memorandum and to

implement it.

Accordingly, Secretary to the Cabinet has been directed to communicate to

the relevant authorities to implement the said decision, which reads as

follows;

(i) 2015-

03-26 (1), (2), (3), (4), (5)

;

(ii) (i)

.

The petitioners state that giving effect to the said Cabinet decision the then

Inspector General of Police issued a directive dated 18-03-2019, outlining

the dates of which the appointments of all eligible officers who had already

received promotions after sustaining respective injuries were to be

backdated based on their date of sustaining the injury.

Page 25 of 29

The petitioners claim that by granting promotions in terms of the

recommendation 01 to those officers who were similarly circumstanced and

retired without earning a promotion, and making the petitioners earned

promotions while in service backdated to their date of injury, amounts to

equals being treated unequally.

At the hearing of these applications, it was the submission of the learned

Counsel for the petitioners that since the petitioners have already earned a

promotion before their retirement, they should have been granted a further

promotion rather than backdating their earned promotions to their date of

injury.

In their petitions, the petitioners have averred that once they came to know

about the directive of the Inspector General of Police, marked P-06A and P-

07 in the respective petitions, they lodged a complaint with the Human

Rights Commission in this regard. They have submitted the findings of the

Human Rights Commission along with the petition to substantiate the said

fact.

It clearly appears that the complaints to the Human Rights Commission by

the individual police officers had been after the Inspector General of Police

issued the letter dated 18-03-2019 where he published the name list of the

police officers whose promotions were back dated in compliance with the

earlier mentioned Cabinet decision.

The 1st and the 37th respondent, namely, the Inspector General of Police and

the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers, have taken up the position that

the relevant authorities have already implemented the decision of the

Cabinet of Ministers. They have also taken up several objections as to the

maintainability of these applications. The main objection amongst them is

that the applications are time bared in terms of Article 126(2) of the

Constitution.

Therefore, let me first deal with the said main preliminary objection

pertaining to the time bar as it amounts to a matter that goes into the core

of the applications before the Court.

Page 26 of 29

I am of the view that if the said objection succeeds, considering the other

factual matters would become irrelevant.

The relevant Article 126(2) of the Constitution reads as follows;

126. (2) Where any person alleges that any such Fundamental

Rights or Language Right relating to such person has been

infringed or is about to be infringed by executive or

administrative action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law on

his behalf, within one month thereof, in accordance with such

rules of Court as maybe in force, apply to the Supreme Court by

way of petition in writing addressed to such Court praying for

relief or redress in respect of such infringement. Such application

maybe proceeded with only with leave to proceed first had and

obtained from the Supreme Court, which leave maybe granted or

refused, as the case maybe, by not less than two judges.

As I have highlighted previously, the petitioners have come before this Court

challenging the constitutionality of the Cabinet Memorandum No. 10/2015

dated 26-03-2015, and the Cabinet decision taken in that regard on 23-05-

2017. I find that, in their petition, the petitioners have conveniently failed to

mention when they become aware of the said Cabinet decision.

However, it appears that by referring to the document marked P-06(A),

which is the letter issued by the Inspector General of Police on 18-03-2019

as to the officers who would stand benefited from the said Cabinet decision,

the petitioners stand appears to be that, since they have lodged complaints

with the Human Rights Commission, the time limit of one month should not

be computed as a bar in view of the inquiry into their complaints by the

Commission.

The relevant section 13 of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act

No. 21 of 1996 which refers to the applicability of the time limitation in

terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution reads as follows;

13 (1). Where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms

of section 14, to the Commission, within one month of the

alleged infringement or imminent infringement of a fundamental

right by executive or administrative action, the period within

which the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the

Commission, shall not be taken into account in computing the

period of one month within which an application may be made to

the Supreme Court by such person in terms of Article 126 (2) of

the Constitution.

The above section clearly provides that to claim protection under section

13(1); an aggrieved party must complain about the alleged or imminent

infringement of a fundamental right within one-month of the occurrence of it

to the Human Rights Commission.

Evidently, the petitioners who are seeking to challenge the Cabinet Decision

taken on 23-05-2017 have failed to lodge a complaint to the Human Rights

Commission within one month of the said decision.

I find no basis to consider that the alleged infringement amounts to a

continuous violation of human rights as claimed in the respective petitions.

As I have discussed previously, the petitioners have come before this Court

based on the Cabinet decision, and not on the basis that the relevant

authorities to whom the Secretary to the Cabinet communicated the Cabinet

Decision for its implementation infringed their fundamental rights in any

manner.

In fact, the letter issued by the Inspector General of Police on 18-03-2019

clearly establishes that the petitioners, who fall under the 2nd category of

officers and are entitled to be benefited in terms of the relevant Cabinet

decision.

This Court has consistently held that the time period of one month set out

in Article 126(2) of the Constitution shall be considered applicable, unless

the alleged infringement amounts to a continuous infringement of

fundamental rights or falls under the terms of section 13(1) of the Human

Rights Commission Act.

In the case of Edirisuriya Vs. Nawarathnam and Others (1985) 1 SLR 100

at page 105, it was observed:

This court has consistently proceeded on the basis that the time limit of

one month set out in Article 126(2) of the Constitution is mandatory.

It was observed in the case of Gamaethige Vs. Siriwardena (1988) 1 SLR

385:

Three principles are discernible in regard to the operation of the time

limit prescribed by Article 126(2). Time begins to run when the

infringement takes place; if knowledge on the part of the petitioner is

required (e.g. of other instances by comparison with which the

treatment meted out to him becomes discriminatory), time begins to run

only when both infringement and knowledge exists.

It is my considered view that the petitioners should have known that the

Cabinet Decision reached on 23-05-2017 will not allow them an additional

promotion rather than backdating the promotion they have already received

to their date of sustaining the respective injuries. I find no basis for one to

argue that fact was not within their knowledge. They would have known very

well that there was no Cabinet Decision that would grant them an additional

promotion.

For the matters considered as above, I hold that the objection raised as to

the time bar of these two applications shall succeed, and the applications

should stand dismissed on that ground alone.

In view of the above, I find that it is unnecessary for me to consider the

other factual matters urged before this Court.

Page 29 of 29

Accordingly, while upholding the objection raised as to the maintainability of

the action on the basis that both the applications are time barred, I dismiss

the two petitions filed before the Court by the petitioners.

Having considered the relevant facts and the circumstances, I order no

costs.
