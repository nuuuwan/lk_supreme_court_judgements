"The  petitioners 
claim 
that  by 
granting  promotions 
in 
terms 
of 
the"
"recommendation 01 to those officers who were similarly circumstanced and"
"retired  without  earning  a  promotion,  and  making  the  petitioners  earned"
"promotions  while  in  service  backdated  to  their  date  of  injury,  amounts  to"
"equals being treated unequally."
"At  the  hearing  of  these  applications,  it  was  the  submission  of  the  learned"
"Counsel for the petitioners that since the petitioners have already earned a"
"promotion before their retirement, they should have been granted a further"
"promotion  rather  than  backdating  their  earned  promotions  to  their  date  of"
"injury."
"In their petitions, the petitioners have averred that once they came to know"
"about the directive of the Inspector General of Police, marked P-06A and P-"
"07  in  the  respective  petitions,  they  lodged  a  complaint  with  the  Human"
"Rights Commission  in this regard. They have submitted the findings of the"
"Human Rights Commission along with the petition to substantiate the said"
"fact."
"It clearly appears that the complaints to the Human Rights Commission by"
"the  individual  police  officers  had  been  after  the  Inspector  General  of  Police"
"issued the letter dated 18-03-2019 where he published the name list of the"
"police  officers  whose  promotions  were  back  dated  in  compliance  with  the"
"earlier mentioned Cabinet decision."
"The 1st and the 37th respondent, namely, the Inspector General of Police and"
"the  Secretary  to  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers,  have  taken  up  the  position  that"
"the  relevant  authorities  have  already 
implemented 
the  decision  of 
the"
"Cabinet  of  Ministers.  They  have  also  taken  up  several  objections  as  to  the"
"maintainability  of  these  applications.  The  main  objection  amongst  them  is"
"that  the  applications  are  time  bared 
in  terms  of  Article  126(2)  of  the"
"Constitution."
"Therefore, 
let  me 
first  deal  with 
the  said  main  preliminary  objection"
"pertaining to the time bar as it amounts to a matter that goes into the core"
"of the applications before the Court."
