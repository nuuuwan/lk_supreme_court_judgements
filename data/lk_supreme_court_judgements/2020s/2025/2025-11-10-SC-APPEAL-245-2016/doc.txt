1. The Petitioner-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) made an

application to the Provincial High Court holden in Hambantota seeking, inter alia, a writ

of certiorari to quash a decision of the 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the “2nd Respondent”). Following a dismissal of the Appellant’s

application by the Provincial High Court by order dated 08th November 2011, the

Appellant challenged such dismissal in the Court of Appeal. Following a dismissal of the

Appellant’s application by the Court of Appeal by judgment dated 25th May 2016, the

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 19

appellant has preferred the present appeal before the Supreme Court. On 8th December

2016, this Court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law:

“a. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by holding that the Provincial High Court of

the Southern Province Holden in Hambantota did not have jurisdiction to hear and

determine Petitioner's application?

b. Did The Court of Appeal misinterpret the Article 154P of the Constitution?

c. Did the Court of Appeal fail to properly evaluate the provisions of Agrarian

Development Act No. 46 of 2000 (as amended)?

d. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by applying the judgment of the Supreme Court

in M.P. Wijesuriya Vs Nimalawathi Wanigasinghe which has no application to the

present matter?”

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

2. The Appellant is the owner of the paddy land known as ‘Aluthwewamulana’, one acre

and one rood in extent (A1-R1-P0). As proof thereof, the document marked “P1” is

tendered, deemed to be the extract from the Agricultural Land Register. The 1st

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the “1st Respondent”)

had claimed anda rights from the Appellant with respect to the said paddy land.

3. The 1st Respondent had made a complaint to the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian

Development of Hambantota (bearing No. HA/04/MISSALANIOUS/2008) on 29th

November 2009 that he is the tenant cultivator of the disputed land and to therefore

take necessary steps to protect his rights.

4. Subsequently, an inquiry was held, and it was decided, by order marked “P5A”, that the

1st Respondent is the tenant cultivator of the subject land and that the Appellant should

not disturb the rights of the 1st Respondent. In the said backdrop, the Appellant had

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 19

invoked the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court for an issuance of a writ of certiorari

to quash the said decision of the 2nd Respondent. It is further the Appellant’s contention

that he was not afforded the opportunity to participate in the said inquiry, contrary to

and in violation of the rules of natural justice.

5. The 2nd Respondent, upon filing the statement of objections, raised the preliminary

objection that the Provincial High Court holden in Hambantota had no jurisdiction to

hear and determine this matter.

6. The order of the Provincial High Court held that, in view of the judgment of the Supreme

Court in Wijesuriya v. Wanigasinghe and Others,1 the exercise of island-wide powers

by the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development falls within the domain of the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, and not the Provincial High Court, and thus, action

should have been instituted against the Commissioner in the Court of Appeal.

7. When the Appellant preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal, the learned Judges

adopted the same view, stating that the Provincial High Court did not have jurisdiction

in the present case and is empowered to issue an order in the nature of a writ only on:

(a) matters arising within the province, and (b) matters falling within the Provincial

Council list contained in the Ninth Schedule to the 13th Amendment to the Constitution

and any authority exercising the powers within the province.

ANALYSIS

8. The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution came into effect in 1987, and the Provincial

Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987 was enacted in order to establish Provincial Councils in the

country. The prime objective of the Thirteenth Amendment was to establish a

1 [2011] 2 Sri L.R. 231.

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 19

constitutional framework for devolution of power to units of devolution identified as

“Provinces.” The Amendment was designed to decentralise authority, to allow provincial

institutions to function not as mere administrative extensions of the centre, but as

meaningful organs of governance. This design is reflected both in the language of

Chapter XVIIA of the Constitution and in the Provincial Councils Act, No. 42 of 1987, which

together manifest the characteristics of substantial devolution.

9. In terms of Article 154P(1), there shall be a High Court for each Province with effect from

the date on which Chapter XVIIA of the Constitution comes into force, and each such

High Court shall be designated as the High Court of the relevant Province.

10. Devolution of legislative power is not merely a symbolic gesture but the

institutionalisation of governance at the provincial level. Article 154G(1) enacts that every

Provincial Council may, subject to the Constitution, make statutes applicable to the

Province for which it is established in respect of any matter set out in List I of the Ninth

Schedule. This provision entrusts Provincial Councils with an exclusive legislative sphere,

autonomous within its boundaries. Thus, within the matters devolved under the

Provincial Council List, the Councils enjoy plenary competence. This plenary character of

authority marks the “substantial” nature of devolution envisaged by the Thirteenth

Amendment.

11. Article 154P(4) of the Constitution specifies the scope of jurisdiction of Provincial High

Courts. It states,

“Every such High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue, according to law –

(a) orders in the nature of habeas corpus, in respect of persons illegally

detained within the Province; and

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 19

(b) order in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition, procedendo,

mandamus and quo warranto against any person exercising, within the

Province, any power under –

(i) any law; or

(ii) any statutes made by the Provincial Council established for that

Province, in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council

List.”

The Issue Contested Before the Provincial High Court Must Pertain to a Matter

Listed Under the Provincial Council List

12. The devolutionary pattern under the Thirteenth Amendment empowers both the

Parliament and the Provincial Councils to legislate on matters listed under the Provincial

Council List in three specific instances, as delineated in Articles 154G(3), 154G(4), and

154G(11) of the Constitution. However, this should not be interpreted as allowing the

Parliament, through the devolutionary scheme itself, to diminish the legislative powers

devolved to the Provincial Councils. The provisions of the Thirteenth Amendment must

be interpreted purposively, in a manner that upholds the foundational rationale for its

introduction into the Constitution.

13. Where Parliament has enacted a law on a matter included in the Provincial Council List,

the residual scope of that subject must still be understood as falling within the legislative

competence of the Provincial Councils, to be exercised through their own statutes.

Furthermore, with regard to the concept of “National Policy,” as clarified in this Court’s

determination on the Divineguma Bill,2 such a policy cannot take the form of a

functional scheme of administration. Rather, it operates only as a framework or set of

2 SC/SD/01/2012, SC/SD/02/2012 and SC/SD/03/2012.

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 19

guiding principles within which the Provinces may exercise their devolved legislative

powers.

14. Moreover, once a law relating to a devolved subject is amended or repealed, either in

whole or in part, the legislative competence of the Provincial Councils over that subject

may immediately be exercised. Accordingly, this Court is of the view that subjects

devolved under the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution cannot be withdrawn or annulled

by subsequent legislation of Parliament.

15. It is pertinent to note that the constitutional establishment of the Provincial High Courts

represents a recognition of the need to resolve local disputes through judges with closer

familiarity to such issues, while also removing the hardship of litigants who would

otherwise have to seek justice only before the superior courts in Colombo. This was a

central purpose of the Thirteenth Amendment when the Bill was originally presented to

Parliament. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the PHCs must be preserved inviolate and

cannot be diminished by interpretations that would undermine the rationale of the

Thirteenth Amendment.

16. In this context, the first question to be considered is whether “Agrarian Services” fall

within the scope of the Provincial Council List. Item 9 of the List, set out in the Ninth

Schedule, provides as follows:

“9. Agriculture and Agrarian Services –

9.1. Agriculture, including agricultural extension, promotion and education for

provincial purposes, and agricultural services (other than in inter-provincial

irrigation and land settlement schemes, State land and plantation

agriculture);

9.2. Rehabilitation and maintenance of minor irrigation works;

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 19

9.3. Agricultural research, save and except institutions designated as national

agricultural research institutions.”

17. The Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979 was repealed in the year 2000 with the

introduction of the Agrarian Development Act, No. 46 of 2000 (as amended), and the long

title to the Agrarian Development Act describes the ambit of the Act as follows:

"An act to provide for matters relating to landlords and tenant cultivators of paddy

lands, for the utilization of agricultural lands in accordance with agricultural policies

for the establishment of Agrarian Development Councils, to provide for the

establishment of a land bank and Agrarian Tribunals...”

18. Accordingly, and subject to the express limitations stated in the Ninth Schedule,

“Agrarian Services” must be regarded as a matter falling within the Provincial Council List.

The present case concerns the issue of tenancy, a matter addressed in Madduma Banda

v. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services and Another,3 where this Court held

that the term “agrarian” in item 9 of the Provincial Council List refers to landed property,

including paddy lands and tenant cultivators:

"The word ‘agrarian’ relates to landed property and such property no doubt would

attract paddy lands and tenant cultivators of such land."4

19. In Kalu Arachchige Allen Nona v. Sunil Weerasinghe,5 Vijith Malalgoda, PC, J (P/CA,

as His Lordship was then) adopted the same view, stating that, if a purposive

interpretation is given, the said Act fulfils the requirement of the title "Agriculture and

3 [2003] 2 Sri L.R. 80

4 ibid., at p. 91

5 CA Writ 23/2013, CA Minutes of 10th June 2016, at p. 4

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 19

Agrarian Services" referred to in Section 9 of the Provincial Council list. Therefore, the

issue before this Court properly falls within the Provincial Council List.

Exercising Power Derived from Any Law or Provincial Statute

20. The authority exercised in such matters may derive either from a law enacted by

Parliament or from a statute enacted by a Provincial Council. Article 154F(2) does not

operate to restrict the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court in respect of cases arising

under statutes enacted by the Provincial Councils. The Provincial High Court accordingly

retains jurisdiction over matters governed by laws relating to subjects devolved under

the Provincial Council List. The key inquiry for the Court, therefore, is whether the subject

matter in dispute falls within a devolved subject, regardless of whether the relevant

provision is found in an Act of Parliament or a Provincial statute.

21. In the present case, although the dispute arises under the Agrarian Development Act, No.

46 of 2000 (as amended), which is an Act of Parliament, since ‘Agrarian Services’ are

expressly recognised as a devolved subject, the matter must be understood as falling

within the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court pursuant to this second criterion.

Against Any Person Exercising Power, Within the Province, Under Any Law or

Provincial Statute

22. The central question, in the instant case, is the extent to which this power is qualified by

the words “within the Province”. The case of Wijesuriya v. Wanigasinghe and Others,6

has taken a rather restrictive view, requiring that the power or authority itself be

provincial in character for a Provincial High Court to exercise its writ jurisdiction.

6 [2011] 2 Sri L.R. 231

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 19

23. In Wijesuriya v. Wanigasinghe (supra),7 this Court interpreted Article 154P(4) and

found that it conferred jurisdiction on the Provincial High Courts to issue orders in the

nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto only

in respect of:

(i) those matters enumerated in the Provincial Council List (List I) of the Ninth

Schedule to the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and

(ii) against a person exercising power pursuant to any law or provincial specific

statutes within the Province.8

24. The Court in Wijesuriya9 further considered the meaning of the term “within” in Article

154P(4)(b), concluding the decisive factor to be the qualitative nature of the power

exercised, i.e., whether the scope of the power per se—and not the manner and extent

of its exercise—was provincial in character or whether it was exercised from a centrally

acting authority for the entire island.

25. In the present case, relying on the judgment in Wijesuriya,10 learned Counsel for the

Respondents contended that the Provincial High Court did not have jurisdiction to hear

and determine the application as the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development

exercises powers of an island-wide nature, arguing that the writ application in question

ought to have filed before the Court of Appeal.

26. Although, the application of the Appellant before the Provincial High Court challenged a

decision of the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development, the Respondents

7 ibid

8 ibid, at p. 236-237

9 ibid, at p. 239

10 ibid

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 19

sought to argue in light of Section 38(5) of the Agrarian Development Act that the

Assistant Commissioner exercises powers of the Commissioner-General within the area

for which such Assistant Commissioner is appointed, and that such functions of the

Assistant Commissioners are carried out in furtherance of the national policy.

27. It is in light of this argument that the Provincial High Court dismissed the application and

the Court of Appeal went on to affirm such dismissal. I am of the view, however, that

such an application of the Wijesuriya dicta risks contradicting Article 154P(4)(b)(i) of the

Constitution.

28. This provision expressly empowers the Provincial High Court to issue orders in the nature

of writs of certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto “against any

person” exercising authority derived from “any law” or “provincial statute”. The breadth

of the terms “any person” and “any power,” particularly the word “any,” must be

interpreted expansively to include both centrally and provincially located authorities,

provided the subject matter falls within a devolved subject.

29. To impose a restrictive interpretation undermines the fundamental objective of the

Thirteenth Amendment, which is to establish a devolutionary scheme. Devolution was

intended not only as a constitutional accommodation of minority claims but also as a

mechanism to foster localised governance, encourage economic growth, and allow

provincial expertise to address regional problems more effectively. Such a scheme

enhances democratic participation, strengthens trust in political institutions, and permits

provinces to function as “laboratories of democracy” responsive to the distinct needs of

their populations. To draw a rigid distinction between “central” and “provincial” authority

in this context risks frustrating these objectives.

30. The jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court is not without limitation. The Provincial High

Court cannot issue writs in respect of: (a) aspects of devolved subjects expressly excluded

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 19

in the Ninth Schedule itself; (b) matters falling within the Concurrent List; and (c) subjects

in the Reserved List. Nevertheless, actions and decisions incidental to, or consequential

upon, devolved matters do properly fall within the competence of the Provincial High

Court, so long as such actions and decisions are of an authority that exercises its power

within the province.

31. In any event, the 2nd Respondent of the instant case is the Assistant Commissioner of

Agrarian Development attached to the Agrarian Development Office in Hambantota. The

Assistant Commissioner’s authority is derived from the Agrarian Development Act No. 46

of 2000 (as amended), a law relating to agrarian services: a subject expressly devolved

under the Provincial Council List.

32. According to Section 38(5) of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000 (as amended),

“Every Assistant Commissioner may exercise all or any of the powers of the

Commissioner-General under this Act, within the area to which such Assistant

Commissioner is appointed.”

33. Counsel for the Respondent further invited this Court to consider Section 38(7) of the

Act, which states that,

“The Additional Commissioner General, The Commissioners, the Deputy

Commissioner General, every Assistant Commissioner and every Agrarian

Development Officer shall in the exercise of his powers and the performance of his

duties under this Act, be subject to the direction and control of the Commissioner-

General.

34. It is based on these sections that the objection with regard to jurisdiction was raised. As

such, questions of law before this Court must necessarily be answered keeping in mind

the scope of the Assistant Commissioner’s power under the Section 38(5) of the Act,

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 19

which are very clearly limited to the area within which an Assistant Commissioner is

appointed. Moreover, although Assistant Commissioners exercise such power subject to

the direction and control of the Commissioner-General, there is no basis whatsoever to

claim that such direction and control can impute a central character to the actions and

decision of an Assistant Commissioner.

Analysis of the Questions of Law

35. The first question of law requires this Court to consider whether the Court of Appeal

erred in law by holding that the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden

in Hambantota did not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the Petitioner’s

application. It is a question of law so wide in scope, the answer to this question

necessarily includes the answers to all questions of law before this Court. For this reason,

in the course of my analysis on the first question of law, I shall proceed to answer the

rest in no particular order.

36. The matter in question relates to agrarian services, specifically the recognition of tenant

cultivation rights in paddy lands. As discussed above, Item 9 of the Provincial Council List

in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution expressly devolves “Agriculture and Agrarian

Services” to the Provincial Councils, subject to certain exclusions not applicable to the

present dispute. Accordingly, disputes concerning tenancy rights under the Agrarian

Development Act fall within the competence of the Provincial Councils. Moreover,

although the matter involves an Act of Parliament, the subject matter it regulates,

“Agrarian Services”, is devolved. These matters have not been contested.

37. As to the “within the province” limitation, as previously noted, the Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Development in Hambantota is an officer functioning within

the province and deriving authority from the Agrarian Development Act. To this extent,

the instant matter is distinguishable from the Wijesuriya dicta, and the Court of Appeal

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 19

has erred in treating the same as binding on the instant matter. As such, it is my view

that the reliance placed on Wijesuriya was misplaced. Accordingly, the fourth and final

question of law is answered in the affirmative.

38. In terms of the second question of law, the Court of Appeal appear to have considered

Article 154P, relying on an overblown reading of the Wijesuriya Case leading to an

unduly restrictive interpretation of the term “within the Province” in Article 154P(4)(b),

even as the case was clearly distinguishable. As previously noted, it was the finding of

the Court of Appeal that the Provincial High Court may only issue writs of certiorari,

prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against authorities deemed to

be “provincial” in character, excluding those deriving powers from centrally acting

authorities. Such an approach, in my view, runs contrary to the plain language of the

Constitution.

39. As I briefly noted earlier in the judgment, the provision uses the words “any person” and

“any law or provincial statute.” The word “any” must be given its natural, expansive

meaning, especially considering the constitutional text being one designed to devolve

authority. Limiting the provision to a qualitative assessment of whether the authority

itself is central or provincial undermines the very purpose of Article 154P, which is to

provide a forum at the provincial level for resolving disputes arising out of devolved

subjects.

40. It is not the physical location of the authority—as correctly observed by the Court of

Appeal—nor the post or designation of the authority as either “central” or “provincial”

that are decisive. The decisive factor, as highlighted in the Wijesuriya Case is the scope

of the power that is exercised. In fact, even a central authority may be amenable to

judicial review under Article 154P(4)(b) where such authority exercises a power that is

provincial in scope and character.

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 19

41. Provincial delegates exercising power on behalf of a central supervising authority is far

from uncommon. The Agrarian Development Act, too, established such a scheme of

administration. If we are to interpret Article 154P(4)(b) in such a manner to exclude all

such provincial actors, simply because they act under the authority and supervision of a

central authority, that would be to significantly attenuate writ jurisdictions of the

Provincial High Courts.

42. We must also appreciate the apparent intention of the framers of the Thirteenth

Amendment for Provincial High Courts to serve as accessible institutions of justice in

matters affecting local communities. This Amendment was animated by a recognition

that justice must be brought closer to the people. The creation of Provincial High Courts

was not a mere administrative reorganisation but a deliberate constitutional choice to

remedy the inequities of a system in which litigants across the island were compelled to

journey to Colombo to vindicate rights even in matters inherently local in character. The

right to effective access to justice is not a peripheral value: it is intrinsic to the rule of law

itself. A constitutional promise of devolution that does not secure this access is a hollow

one. A restrictive interpretation, therefore, offends both the text and the purpose of the

Constitution.

43. Matters of jurisdiction in general—especially those relating to territorial jurisdiction—

when unduly complicated, have the effect of taking the ordinary man further away from

the halls of justice. That would most certainly be antithetical to the most fundamental

objective of establishing Provincial High Courts. It should not take those most skilled

lawyers specially trained in the art of statutory and constitutional interpretation to

determine something so simple as to which court one might take their pleas.

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 19

44. As one of the most rudimentary rules of statutory interpretation directs us, there is no

need for a court to seek secondary meanings or interpretations where a plain reading is

clear and produces no absurdity.

45. Article 154P(4)(b) of the Constitution establishes that High Courts of the Provinces have

jurisdiction to issue, according to law, orders in the nature of writs of certiorari,

prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto “against any person exercising,

within the Province, any power under” any law, or provincial statute.

46. The term “within the Province” herein may conceivably lead to some confusion owing to

its placement in the text and requires some clarification. This Court, as the forum with

sole and exclusive jurisdiction to address such uncertainties within the constitutional text,

has previously ventured to explicate the same in Wijesuriya v. Wanigasinghe (supra),11

which I have already adverted to in some detail. As it was decided in the Wijesuriya

Case, the decisive factor is the qualitative scope of the power exercised, i.e., if the power

itself is one that relates to provinces, the respective Provincial High Court would have

jurisdiction under Article 154P(4)(b) of the Constitution. To inflate the said dicta to bring

within its purview such subordinate officers acting under the Commissioner-General’s

authority, in my view, is completely ill-conceived.

47. Similarly, Section 38(5) of the Agrarian Development Act states that “[e]very Assistant

Commissioner may exercise all or any of the powers of the Commissioner-General under

this Act, within the area to which such Assistant Commissioner is appointed.”

48. This very clearly indicates that the Assistant Commissioner’s power to exercise the powers

of the Commissioner-General so delegates is strictly limited to his or her area of

appointment. To this extent, the Court of Appeal has erred in considering the powers of

11 [2011] 2 Sri L.R. 231.

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 19

the Assistant Commissioners to be of “island-wide” nature. Accordingly, the third

question of law, too, is answered in the affirmative.

49. In light of the above, this Court must affirm, in the clearest terms, that where the subject

matter of a dispute arises under a devolved subject, the Provincial High Court is vested

with jurisdiction, notwithstanding whether the official whose decision is impugned is a

central or provincial officer, so long as the qualitative character and the scope of the

power exercised is provincial. To hold otherwise is to privilege the administrative

convenience of officials over the constitutional rights of citizens.

50. The Thirteenth Amendment did not devolve power for the ease of government but for

the empowerment of the governed. The devolutionary scheme cannot be reduced to an

empty formality, nor can the Provincial High Courts be relegated to second-class forums.

They are courts of plenary writ jurisdiction in respect of devolved subjects, and their role

must be vindicated accordingly.

51. I would be remiss if I did not address the concerns of the 2nd Respondent as to national

policy. It was the submission of the 2nd Respondent that the Assistant Commissioner

being amenable to writ jurisdiction of the Provincial High Courts would entail unforeseen

consequences, in light of the fact that the Assistant Commissioner acts in furtherance of

the national policy on agrarian development. It was highlighted that there is a possibility

of different courts taking contrasting decisions and stances with regard to the national

policy which the Agrarian Development Act seeks to implement, for national policy should

always be uniform. This concern, in my view, may be somewhat misplaced. Judicial review,

especially in the exercise of writ jurisdiction, is performed under widely accepted grounds

and within the contours of well-established principles. In addition, one of the cardinal

rules observed by courts in this function is to refrain from being arbiters of political or

SC Appeal 245/2016 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 19

policy questions, in order to avoid any potential encroachments of the executive

province.

52. In light of the above, it is my considered view that the Appellant originally invoked the

proper forum. The first question of law is therefore answered in the affirmative.

53. As all questions of law are answered in the affirmative, the Appeal is accordingly allowed.

The order of the High Court of the Provinces holden in Hambantota dated 08th November

2011 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 25th May 2016 are both set aside.

54. The High Court of the Provinces holden in Hambantota is directed to hear and determine

the application on its merits. The High Court is further directed to expedite this matter,

as it has been pending since 2010.
