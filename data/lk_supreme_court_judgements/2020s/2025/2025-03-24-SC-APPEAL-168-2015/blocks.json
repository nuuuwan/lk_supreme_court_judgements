The Plaintiff Petitioner Respondent Respondent (Hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff) filed action in the District Court of Anuradhapura in Case No.21814/M against the Rajarata Sanwardana Bankuwa (Hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Defendant) and the 2nd 4th Defendants Respondents Respondents Respondents (Hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd 4th Defendants). As per the Plaint dated 06.03.2007, filed in the District Court of Anuradhapura, the claim of the Plaintiff was related to an alleged deprivation of overtime payments, promotion and certain other payments etc. Further, the Plaint states that the said 1st Defendant was established under the Regional Development Bank Act, No. 6 of 1997. In responding to the above Plaint, the Defendants, namely 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants, together filed their Answer dated 26.07.2007, claiming that the Plaintiffs claim is that of a malicious prosecution, and also raised few preliminary objections. Thus, the Defendants inter alia pleaded to dismiss the case of the Plaintiff at the first instance based on the preliminary objections and otherwise also on merits. In reply, a Replication was filed by the Plaintiff refuting the claims in the Answer.",

(Highlighted in bold letters is done by me) The section quoted above clearly indicates that the intention of the legislature was to vest the business of the vesting bank carried on at the time of vesting in the acquiring bank. It must be also noted that, as per the Section 45 (1) of the Act quoted below, with the publication of the vesting order in the Gazette, the Regional Development Banks Act, No. 6 of 1997 which established the 1st Defendant was repealed terminating the existence of the 1st Defendant Bank before law as there was no provision to keep the 1st Defendant as an existing legal person. In fact, incorporation orders of Development Banks including the 1st Defendant are deemed to have been revoked in terms of Section 43(b) of the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act, No.41 of 2008. The Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act No.41of 2008 does not provide to merge or amalgamate the banks such as 1st Defendant Bank with the Bank established by the said Act, namely the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bankuwa, the Party Sought to be Substituted, which is also the Appellant, other than the provisions for vesting its business on the acquiring bank. It is important to consider what is mentioned in aforesaid Section 42(c) which vest all the liabilities of the Vesting Bank or Banks as are subsisting on the day immediately preceding the date of the Vesting Order since those liabilities too fall within the term the business presently carried out by the Development Banks. The case that was filed by the Plaintiff and pending against the 1st Defendant Bank was not concluded against the 1st Defendant on the day immediately preceding the date of the vesting order. Whether there is a liability on the Defendant Bank was contingent upon the Judgment of the case that was yet to be decided. It is true that at the end, rights were to be decided as at the date of filing of the action but it was yet to be decided and the 1st Defendant became abolished before law with the vesting order. Thus, there was no existing liability decided by the Court in that case as at the day immediately preceding the date of vesting order except for the alleged cause of action of the case. Hence, everything depends on the fact whether there was a surviving cause of action that could be proceeded against the Party Sought to be Substituted, in other words against the Appellant, on the day of the vesting order.

    "text": "Section 45(1) above repealed the Act that paved way for the establishment of the 1st Defendant. Section 45(2)(a) vest all contracts, bonds and agreements etc. pertaining or relating to the vested business of the vesting bank or banks in the acquiring bank. However, it does not vest contracts of employment in the acquiring bank. Section 45(2)(b) above vest all actions and proceedings pertaining or relating to the vested business of vesting bank or banks pending on the day immediately preceding the day of vesting in the acquiring bank. However, it does not vest pending actions based on contract of employment or relating to employer-employee relationship. Hence, the action against the 1st Defendant filed by the Plaintiff does not fall within the ambit of Section 45(2)(b) as it does not relate to the vested business of the vesting bank but relates to the issues pertaining to employer-employee relationship between them. Section 45(2) (c) above is to transfer the monies of the vesting bank to a special reserve fund. Afore mentioned Section 45(2)(d) clearly indicates that the intention of the legislature was to create new employer-employee relationships between the employees of the vesting bank with the acquiring bank as far as possible on the same or better terms and conditions that existed with the vesting bank when the said employees accept the offers of new employment offered to each of them. However, if any of the employees not willing to accept the new offer, he or she could opt for compensation as determined under Section 46 of the Act. As per the submissions made and documents marked R2 and R3 found in the brief, it is apparent that the Plaintiff accepted the offer made by the Party Sought to be Substituted, namely by the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bankuwa or Regional Development Bank. Thus, the relationship between the Party Sought to be Substituted and the Plaintiff is based on the said new contract of employment and Party Sought to be Substituted is not a party to the contract of employment between the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff nor a successor to it as the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act did not make the Party Sought to be Substituted a successor to every contractual obligation of the vesting bank. In such a backdrop, cause of action that allegedly arose against the 1st Defendant in relation to the contract of employment or employer-employee relationship based on that contract of employment cannot survive against the Party Sought to be Substituted whose relationship with the Plaintiff is based on a new contract of employment. The Plaintiff cannot be allowed to blow hot and cold together stating that her relationship with the Party Sought to be Substituted is based on both the contract of employments, namely one with the 1st Defendant as well as with the new contract of employment with the Party Sought to be Substituted. In that context, it is apparent that the Learned District Judge erred in allowing the substitution of Party Sought to be Substituted in the place and room of the 1st Defendant and the Learned High Court Judges also erred in affirming such substitution. It must be noted that there is no provision in the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act to merge or amalgamate the two institutions or for the continuation of the legal personality of the 1st Defendant through the Party Sought to be Substituted as its successor, other than certain provisions to vest its business and liabilities that existed at the time of vesting in the acquiring bank. However, it provided for new contract of employment with the Party Sought to be Substituted and the Plaintiff accepted the offer made by the Party Sought to be Substituted. As there was provision for compensation, if the Plaintiff did not want to accept the offer and",

    "text": "thought that it should have considered what she had prayed for in the action against the 1st Defendant, she could have opted for compensation in terms of Section 46 of the Act. Such an option may not be favourable to the Plaintiff but, once an Act is passed by the legislature, it becomes the law of the country and its validity and propriety cannot be challenged in courts. In this regard, the Party Sought to be Substituted had brought this Courts attention to Article 80(3) of the Constitution and relevant case laws which are quoted below; Article 80(3) of the Constitution: Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President or the Speaker, as the case may be, being endorsed thereon, no court or tribunal shall inquire into, pronounce upon or in any manner call in question, the validity of such Act on any ground whatsoever. Gamage v. Perera (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 354, 359: The aforesaid Article thus had clearly stated that in terms of that Article, the constitutional validity of any provision of an Act of Parliament cannot be called in question after the certificate of the President or the Speaker is given. In re the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution and The Provincial Councils Bill (1987) 2 Sri LR 312 at 331: Such a law cannot be challenged on any ground whatsoever even if it conflicts with the provisions of the Constitution, even if it is not competent for Parliament to enact it by a simple majority or two third majority. (See the Judgment where reference has been made to provisions in Article 80(3) of the Constitution) The Party Sought to be Substituted has further brought this Courts attention to the case Matara Wallaboda Pattu Bahukariya Sewaka Samitiya v Matara Wallaboda Pattu Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society, SC 182/68 decided on 17th November 1969 which is found in M.S. Mohammed Hussain's Complete Digest of Case Law of Sri Lanka, Volume 13 at page No. 209 and referred to in some other texts to state that when a business is taken over by another, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the transferee does not automatically take over the employees of the business. It is further brought to the attention of this Court to S.R. De Silva's The Contract of Employment, Monograph No. 04 (2017), at page 100 where it is stated that Where a business is taken over by another employer, the transferee does not, in the absence of an arrangement to the contrary, become the employer of the transferor's employees. The Party Sought to be Substituted has argued in its written submissions that there is a novation of contract. Whatever it is, as explained above, once the Plaintiff accepts the new contract of employment, it is a new contract between the Plaintiff and the Party Sought to be Substituted. The Party Sought to be Substituted does not become a party to the contract of employment that existed between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant. When there is no provision in the new contract of employment to accept liability for the causes of actions against the previous employer, the 1st Defendant, the Plaintiff cannot say that the Party Sought to be Substituted can be substituted for the cause of action against the previous employer, the 1st Respondent.",

    "text": "The documents marked R2 and R3 (documents establishing new contract of employment) do not indicate that there was an agreement to accept the liabilities that may arise from impugned causes of action by the Party Sought to be Substituted. Hence, neither Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act nor the new contract of employment indicates that the cause of action against the 1st Defendant can be proceeded against the Party Sought to be Substituted because it is a new contract of employment that exists between the Party Sought to be Substituted and the Plaintiff. Even though this Court is not bound to follow the decision in Ruhunu Development Bank v Hon. P.J.S. Perera, Court of Appeal Application No. CA. 849/01, C.A.M.02.09.2002, it is important to refer to the said decision as it considered similar provisions in Regional Developments Bank Act No. 6 of 1997. There it was held as follows; What was envisaged by the Act was that there had to be security of employment, by way of guarantee, fresh contracts would be offered to all such employees of the Vesting Bank. At page 10 of the said decision - page 325 of the brief. If the contracts of employment between the employees of the Vesting Bank did not succeed upon the point of vesting in the acquiring bank one could not see at that point of vesting, that the employees of the Vesting Bank were employees of the acquiring Bank or the Petitioner Bank. In these circumstances it is clear that at the point of vesting all contracts of employment terminated by operation of statute in so much as what was envisaged by statute was the operation of new contracts of employment made to the officers and servants who accepted the offer that had been made by the acquiring bank. at pages 11 and 12 of the said decision pages 317 and 318 of the brief. In other words in considering the rights of the acquiring bank, the Petitioner upon the contracts of employment in terms of the provision of 49(a), the intention of the legislature has to be considered. In this regard two matters are relevant. One is that if contracts of employment were to be included under section 49(a) then there would have been no need to specifically mention that new employment would be offered in terms of section 49(c). If contracts of services and employment were included in 49(a) there would have been no need for it to have been dealt specifically in terms of Section 49(c) and this becomes all the more so when one considers the new contracts of employment that had been offered to each and every officer and servant who were employed by the Vesting Bank...........................In other words if fresh contracts had been envisaged by the Act it would be mutually inconsistent to consider that all the contracts have been kept alive in terms of section 49(c) as then two provisions contained in these Sections would be mutually inconsistent at pages No. 9 and 10 of the said decision pages 315 and 316 of the brief. (It is observed that Section 49(a) and 49 (c) referred to in the aforesaid decision is very much similar to Section 45 (2) (a) and 45 (2) (c) of the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act which are relevant to the matter at hand.) Aforesaid decisions referred to by the Party Sought to be Substituted (the Appellant) supports the finding this Court reached above that there is a new contract of employment between the Plaintiff and the Party Sought to be Substituted governing the employer-employee relationship",

    "text": "between them, and the Party Sought to be Substituted is not a successor to the obligations between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant, which could have arisen between Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant based on the contract of employment they had. The Plaintiff has attempted to say that there is a difference of meaning in the Sinhala Section 45(2) (b) and the English section, and therefore, the Sinhala Section must prevail. However, I do not see any difference in meaning as both sections, whether in Sinhala or English, contemplates all actions and proceedings pertaining to or related to the vested business ( ) of such bank or banks. For the reasons discussed above, I have to hold that the Learned District Judge erred in substituting the Party Sought to be Substituted and the Learned High Court Judges erred in affirming the said decision. It must be noted that the application for substitution dated 20.10.2010 was made on the basis that all developments banks in various regions have been amalgamated to form the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bankuwa while also stating that 1st Defendant had been abolished by the Act No.41 of 2008- vide paragraph 2 of the said application. What appears to have happened is that the 1st Defendant has been abolished through the operation of the new Act and a new entity called Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bankuwa has been established while vesting the business of the 1st Defendant and some other development banks on the newly created entity. Being aggrieved by the Judgement of the Civil Appellate High Court, the Appellant, the Party Sought to be Substituted, sought leave to appeal from this Court. When the leave to appeal application was supported on 02.10.2015, this Court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law set out in sub paragraphs (a), (b) & (c) of the Paragraph 19 of the Petition of the Petitioner dated 23.03.2015;",
