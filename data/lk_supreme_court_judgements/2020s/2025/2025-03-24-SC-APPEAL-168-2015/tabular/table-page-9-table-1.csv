"thought that it should  have considered what  she  had prayed for in  the action against the 1st"
"Defendant, she could have opted for compensation in terms of Section 46 of the Act. Such an"
"option may not be favourable to the Plaintiff but, once an Act is passed by the legislature, it"
"becomes the law of the country and its validity and propriety cannot be challenged in courts."
"In this regard, the Party Sought to be Substituted had brought this Court’s attention to Article"
"80(3) of the Constitution and relevant case laws which are quoted below;"
"A
rticle 80(3) of the Constitution:"
"“Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President or the Speaker, as the case"
"may be, being endorsed thereon, no court or tribunal shall inquire into, pronounce upon or in"
"any manner call in question, the validity of such Act on any ground whatsoever.”"
"G
amage v. Perera (2006) 3 Sri L.R. 354, 359: “The aforesaid Article thus had clearly stated"
"that in terms of that Article, the constitutional validity of any provision of an Act of Parliament"
"cannot be called in question after the certificate of the President or the Speaker is given.”"
"I
n re the Thirteenth  Amendment to the Constitution and The Provincial Councils Bill"
"(1987) 2 Sri LR 312 at 331: “Such a law cannot be challenged on any ground whatsoever even"
"if it conflicts with the provisions of the Constitution, even if it is not competent for Parliament"
"to enact it by a simple majority or two third majority.” (See the Judgment where reference has"
"been made to provisions in Article 80(3) of the Constitution)"
"T
he Party Sought to be Substituted has further brought this Court’s attention to the case Matara"
"Wallaboda  Pattu  Bahukariya  Sewaka  Samitiya  v  Matara  Wallaboda  Pattu  Multi-"
"Purpose Co-operative Society, SC 182/68 decided on 17th  November 1969 which is found in"
"M.S. Mohammed Hussain's Complete Digest of Case Law of Sri Lanka, Volume 13 at page"
"No.  209  and  referred  to  in  some  other  texts  to  state  that  when  a  business  is  taken  over  by"
"another, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, the transferee does not automatically"
"take over the employees of the business. It is further brought to the attention of this Court to"
"S.R. De Silva's ‘The Contract of Employment,’ Monograph No. 04 (2017), at page 100"
"where it is stated that “Where a business is taken over by another employer, the transferee"
"does  not,  in  the  absence  of  an  arrangement  to  the  contrary,  become  the  employer  of  the"
"transferor's employees.”"
"T
he Party Sought to be Substituted has argued in its written submissions that there is a novation"
"of contract. Whatever it is, as explained above, once the Plaintiff accepts the new contract of"
"employment, it is a new contract between the Plaintiff and the Party Sought to be Substituted."
"The Party Sought to be Substituted does not become a party to the contract of employment that"
"existed  between  the  Plaintiff  and  the  1st  Defendant.  When  there  is  no  provision  in  the  new"
"contract  of  employment  to  accept  liability  for  the  causes  of  actions  against  the  previous"
"employer, the 1st Defendant, the Plaintiff cannot say that the Party Sought to be Substituted can"
"be substituted for the cause of action against the previous employer, the 1st Respondent."
