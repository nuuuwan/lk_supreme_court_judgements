"(a) all immovable and movable property owned by the Vesting Bank or Banks on, the"
"day immediately preceding the date of the Vesting Order (including cash balances,"

"(b) all  rights,  powers,  privileges,  authorities  and  interests  arising  in  or  out  of,  any"
"property,  movable  or  immovable  owned  by  the  Vesting  Bank  or  Banks  and  any"
"leasehold rights in any immovable property enjoyed by such Vesting Bank or Banks"

c)  all  the  liabilities  of  the  Vesting  bank  or  Banks  as  are  subsisting  on  the  day"
"immediately preceding the date of the Vesting Order; and"
"(d) all books, accounts and documents relating or appertaining, to the business of such"

"T
he section quoted above clearly indicates that the intention of the legislature was to vest the"
"business of the vesting bank carried on at the time of vesting in the acquiring bank. It must be"
"also noted that, as per the Section 45 (1) of the Act quoted below, with the publication of the"
"vesting  order  in  the  Gazette,  the  Regional  Development  Banks  Act,  No.  6  of  1997  which"
"established the 1st Defendant was repealed terminating the existence of the 1st Defendant Bank"
"before law as there was no provision to keep the 1st Defendant as an existing legal person. In"
"fact, incorporation orders of Development Banks including the 1st Defendant are deemed to"
"have been revoked in terms of Section 43(b) of the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act, No.41"
"of 2008. The Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act No.41of 2008 does not provide to merge or"
"amalgamate the banks such as 1st Defendant Bank with the Bank established by the said Act,"
"namely the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bankuwa, the Party Sought to be Substituted, which is also"
"the Appellant,  other than the provisions for vesting its business on the acquiring bank.  It  is"
"important to consider what is mentioned in aforesaid Section 42(c) which vest all the liabilities"

"contingent upon the Judgment of the case that was yet to be decided. It is true that at the end,"
"rights were to be decided as at the date of filing of the action but it was yet to be decided and"
"the  1st  Defendant  became  abolished  before  law  with  the  vesting  order.  Thus,  there  was  no"
"existing liability decided by the Court in that case as at the day immediately preceding the date"
