"Appellant.  The  Appellant  filled  objections  for 
the  substitution  by  way  of  Statement  of"
"Objections  along  with  an  Affidavit  both  dated  26.04.2011.  Through 
its  objections, 
the"
"Appellant took up the position that;"
"• 
The Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act No.41 of 2008 does not suggest that the intention"
"thereof was to ensure ‘merger’ of Developments Banks of the Provinces, including the"
"1st Defendant,"
"• 
The  Pradeshiya  Sanwardana  Bankuwa  (Regional  Development  Bank  or  RDB)  was"
"incorporated,  and 
through 
the  Gazette  Extraordinary  No.165/5  dated  03.05.2010,"
"business of the 1st Defendant was vested with the Appellant (along with the business of"
"other Development Banks),"
"• 
Section 42(1) of the said Act provides only to vest the business presently carried on by"
"the  Development  Banks.  Thus,  employment  contracts  were  not  transferred  to  the"
"Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bankuwa,"
"• 
Aforesaid Act makes specific provisions for the employees of the Vesting Bank to be"
"granted fresh employment in the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bankuwa and does not simply"
"vest those employees in the said Bank,"
"• 
The employees or related liabilities were not ipso facto vested in or transferred to or"
"acquired by the Appellant merely on the fact of the said enactment and establishment"
"of the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bankuwa,"
"• 
The Plaintiff has suppressed that she was offered a fresh employment by  Pradeshiya"
"Sanwardana Bankuwa and the fact that she accepted it,"
"• 
The Plaintiff is not entitled to continue with her purported action against the Pradeshiya"
"Sanwardana Bankuwa, the Appellant, in as much as Section 45 (2) (b) of the Act only"
"permits the continuity of actions pertaining or related to the vested business and the"
"employment contracts were not vested and did not form part of the banking business."
