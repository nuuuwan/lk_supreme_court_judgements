"Section 45(1) above repealed the Act that paved way for the establishment of the 1st Defendant."
"Section 45(2)(a) vest all contracts, bonds and agreements etc. pertaining or relating to the"
"vested business of the vesting bank or banks in the acquiring bank. However, it does not vest"
"contracts  of employment in  the  acquiring bank.  Section 45(2)(b) above  vest  all actions and"
"proceedings pertaining or relating to the vested business of vesting bank or banks pending"
"on the day immediately preceding the day of vesting in the acquiring bank. However, it does"
"not vest pending actions based on contract of employment or relating to employer-employee"
"relationship.  Hence,  the  action  against  the  1st  Defendant  filed  by  the  Plaintiff  does  not  fall"
"within the ambit of Section 45(2)(b) as it does not relate to the vested business of the vesting"
"bank but relates to the issues pertaining to employer-employee relationship between them."
"S
ection 45(2) (c) above is to transfer the monies of the vesting bank to a special reserve fund."
"A
fore mentioned Section 45(2)(d) clearly indicates that the intention of the legislature was to"
"create new employer-employee relationships between the employees of the vesting bank with"
"the acquiring bank as far as possible on the same or better terms and conditions that existed"
"with the vesting bank when the said employees accept the offers of new employment offered"
"to each of them. However, if any of the employees not willing to accept the new offer, he or"
"she  could  opt  for  compensation  as  determined  under  Section  46  of  the  Act.  As  per  the"
"submissions made and documents marked R2 and R3 found in the brief, it is apparent that the"
"Plaintiff  accepted  the  offer  made  by  the  Party  Sought  to  be  Substituted,  namely  by  the"
"Pradeshiya  Sanwardana  Bankuwa  or  Regional  Development  Bank.  Thus,  the  relationship"
"between the Party Sought to be Substituted and the Plaintiff is based on the said new contract"
"of employment and Party Sought to be Substituted is not a party to the contract of employment"
"between the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff nor a successor to it as the Pradeshiya Sanwardana"
"Bank Act  did  not  make the Party  Sought  to  be  Substituted a successor to every contractual"
"obligation of the vesting bank. In such a backdrop, cause of action that allegedly arose against"
"the 1st Defendant in relation to the contract of employment or employer-employee relationship"
"based on that contract of employment cannot survive against the Party Sought to be Substituted"
"whose relationship with the Plaintiff is based on a new contract of employment. The Plaintiff"
"cannot be allowed to blow hot and cold together stating that her relationship with the Party"
"Sought to be Substituted is based on both the contract of employments, namely one with the 1st"
"Defendant  as  well  as  with  the  new  contract  of  employment  with  the  Party  Sought  to  be"
"Substituted. In that context, it is apparent that the Learned District Judge erred in allowing the"
"substitution of Party Sought to be Substituted in the place and room of the 1st Defendant and"
"the Learned High Court Judges also erred in affirming such substitution."
"I
t must be noted that there is no provision in the Pradeshiya Sanwardana Bank Act to merge or"
"amalgamate  the  two  institutions  or  for  the  continuation  of  the  legal  personality  of  the  1st"
"Defendant  through  the  Party  Sought  to  be  Substituted  as  its  successor,  other  than  certain"
"provisions to vest its business and liabilities that existed at the time of vesting in the acquiring"
"bank.  However,  it  provided  for  new  contract  of  employment  with  the  Party  Sought  to  be"
"Substituted and the Plaintiff accepted the offer made by the Party Sought to be Substituted. As"
"there  was  provision  for  compensation,  if  the  Plaintiff  did  not  want  to  accept  the  offer  and"
