He further submits that officers of the Thambuttegama Police Station visited the Petitioner at the hospital and that they recorded a statement from him regarding his arrest and torture. The Petitioner has then taken steps to submit complaints to both the Human Rights Commission and the National Police Commission. 11. In these circumstances, the Petitioner alleges that the totality of facts and circumstances as herein before described, the 1st 7th Respondents in this case, arrested, detained and assaulted the Petitioner. It is his position that the Respondents have violated his Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles 11, 12 (1), 13 (1), 13 (2), and 13 (5). 12. In response, the 1st 6th Respondents have submitted that they deny the position that they were the officers who arrested the Petitioner thereby also denying the claims of detaining and torturing him. They maintain that the Petitioner was in fact party to the procession that took place on 02.08.2012 and that the participants of the procession used a loudspeaker without a permit. Further that the crowd proceeded to pelt stones, and clubs inter alia at the Thambuttegama Police Station. This has led to police officers and property being affected negatively. 13. The Respondents state that the 7th Respondent and one Sub Inspector Abeywardhana had seen the Petitioner of the instant case participating in the said unlawful assembly, and causing damage to public property. 14. The Respondents state that officers from Police Stations of Thalawa, Nochchiyagama, and Rajanganaya were called to conduct the investigation and arrest the suspects of the said unlawful assembly.
