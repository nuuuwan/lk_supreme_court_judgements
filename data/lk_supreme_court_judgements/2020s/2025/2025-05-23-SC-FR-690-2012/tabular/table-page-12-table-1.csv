"","suspects from the officers who conducted the special operation. In the"

"","Further,  no  other  information  book  containing  such  information  has"

"","Petitioner. The said Ubayanandana has also failed to make any notes"

"","taken up the position that the Petitioner has sustained injuries during"
"","the  procession  on  02.08.2012.  If  this  version  is  accepted,  Petitioner"

"34.","As I have mentioned before, not only the petitioner but also the two"

"","to implicate them for this arrest and assault."
"35.","In  the  above  circumstances,  there  is  sufficient  material,  and  I  am"
"","inclined to accept the version of the Petitioner and that of his two eye"
"","witnesses’, that the Petitioner was arrested and assaulted by the 1st to"
"","6th respondents, and not the version of the Respondents that it was the"
