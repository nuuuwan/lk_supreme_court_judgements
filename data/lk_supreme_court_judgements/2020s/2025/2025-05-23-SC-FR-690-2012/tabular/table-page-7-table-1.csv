"urther, in Gunawardene  v. Perera and Others [1983] 1 SLR 305"
"at 313, Soza J. held that"
"“…It  is  generally  accepted  that  within  this  standard  there  could  be"
"varying  degrees  of  probability.  The  degree  of  probability  required"
"should be commensurate with the gravity of the allegation sought to"
"be  proved.  This  court  when  called  upon  to  determine  questions  of"
"infringement  of  fundamental  rights  will  insist  on  a  high  degree  of"
"probability as for instance a court having to decide a question of fraud"
"in a civil suit would. The conscience of the court must be satisfied that"
"there has been an infringement.”"
