"","Petitioner  at  the  said  procession,  I  am  not  strongly  convinced  by  the"

"","the unlawful gathering for the following reason."
"39.","The B Report filed in case number 896/ 2012 has identified twenty"
"","five individuals as accused, under the same B Report, thirteen suspects"
"","(including the Petitioner as the 7th suspect) were produced before the"
"","Magistrate, as persons who took part in the procession on 02.08.2012."
"","Although the 7th respondent claims to have seen the Petitioner at the"
"","procession on the 2nd August and has made notes, the 7th respondent"
"","has failed to mention the same in the B report filed in the Magistrates’"
"","Court  that  was  signed  by  the  7th  Respondent  himself.  Hence,  I  am"
"","inclined to hold that the documents and statements to the effect of the"
"","Petitioner being party to the procession are likely afterthoughts by the"
"","Respondents of the instant case."

"","“Whenever an investigation under this Chapter cannot be completed"
"","within the period of twenty-four hours fixed by section 37, and there"

"","forward the suspect to the Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case"

"","the case”."
"41.","Although, the 7th respondent claims and made notes that he saw the"
