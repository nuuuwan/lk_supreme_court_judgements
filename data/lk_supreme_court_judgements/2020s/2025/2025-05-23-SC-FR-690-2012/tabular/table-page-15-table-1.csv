"video  evidence.  However,  they  have  also  failed  to  submit  such  proof"
"before this Court to support their case."

Therefore, I am of the view that there were no reasonable grounds to"
"arrest  the  Petitioner  and  that  unreasonable  force  was  used  in  the"
"process  of  arrest,  whereby 
the  Petitioner  has  not  been  arrested"
"according to the due process provided by the law. Hence, I hold that the"
"1st  –  7th  Respondents  have  violated  Article  13  (1)  of  the  Constitution"
"against the Petitioner."
"45. 
Article 13 (5) of the Constitution guarantees the right to be presumed"
"innocent  until  proven  guilty.  In  the  case  at  hand,  such  is  deemed"
"violated  given  the  evidence  of  torture,  cruel,  inhuman,  or  degrading"
"treatment  or  punishment  committed  on  the  Petitioner  at  the  time  of"
