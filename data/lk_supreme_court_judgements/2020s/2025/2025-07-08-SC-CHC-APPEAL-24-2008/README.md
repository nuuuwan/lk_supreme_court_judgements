Before: Murdu N. B. Fernando, PC, CJ Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Faisz Musthapha, PC, with Thushani Machado for the 1st and 2nd Defendants Appellants

Pununuwan Wickremasekera with Chinthaka Fernando for the Plaintiff Respondent Argued on: 28th September 2022 Written Tendered on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Defendants Appellants and the Submissions: Plaintiff Respondent on 14th December 2022 Decided on: 8th July 2025 Obeyesekere, J

This is an appeal arising from a judgment delivered by the High Court of the Western

Province holden in Colombo [the Commercial High Court]. By the said judgment, the

Commercial High Court held that the Defendants Appellants [the Defendants] are

liable, in their capacity as sureties/guarantors, for the repayment of two loans granted

by the Plaintiff Respondent [the Plaintiff] to M/s Seneviratne Trading Company

(Private) Limited [the Principal Debtor].

The submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendants give rise to two

questions of law. The first is, where the Principal Debtor is in default, whether the

guarantee that the Defendants have executed in favour of the Plaintiff [P11] require

the Plaintiff to proceed against the Principal Debtor in the first instance, and if so,

whether the Plaintiff can proceed against the Defendants only after the Principal

Debtor has been excussed.

The second question is whether Clause 18 in the guarantee P11, by which the

Defendants had renounced their right to raise certain defences available to a surety

including the defence that the Principal Debtor be pursued and excussed [beneficium

ordinis seu excussionis], is valid and enforceable in terms of the law. The basis for this

second question of law is twofold. The first is that Clause 18 does not contain an

express or specific renunciation of the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis.

3

The second is that Clause 18 only contains a general renunciation of the said defence,

and as the Defendants were not made aware of the effect and/or consequence of such

renunciation by the Plaintiff at the time P11 was executed, such a general renunciation

is not valid and enforceable. Although it may appear that these two bases are but two

sides of the same coin, they are distinct questions of law and must be raised and

addressed separately.

Credit facilities granted to the Principal Debtor

The Plaintiff is a licensed commercial bank. The Principal Debtor, a company registered

under the Companies Act, No. 17 of 1982 as amended had been a long standing

customer of the Plaintiff, and had availed itself of credit facilities running into large

sums of money. The 1st Defendant Gamini Seneviratne, in his capacity as Chairman and

the 2nd Defendant, Sujith Nishantha Seneviratne in his capacity as a Director of the

Principal Debtor had transacted with the Plaintiff on behalf of the Principal Debtor.

The Principal Debtor had faced financial difficulties in 2003 and had requested the

Plaintiff to re-schedule two loans granted to it. This request had been acceded to by

the Plaintiff. Accordingly, by an offer letter dated 3rd September 2003 [P5], the Plaintiff

had agreed to reschedule the existing credit facilities granted to the Principal Debtor

under two new credit facilities.

Under the first, the capital sum was fixed at Rs. 211,506,290 with payment to be made

in equated monthly instalments during a period of 4 years. The repayment of the loan

was to be secured inter alia by a primary mortgage over immoveable property and a

promissory note signed by the Defendants. The second credit facility was in a sum of

Rs. 8,942,267 to be repaid within a period of 15 years. Repayment was to be secured

by a promissory note signed by the Defendants and the hypothecation of stock in trade

of the Principal Debtor.

In their capacity as Chairman and Director of the Principal Debtor, the Defendants had

acknowledged the receipt of the said offer letter P5 and had placed their signatures

on P5 signifying their agreement to the terms of the said offer letter. The Principal

Debtor and the Plaintiff had accordingly entered into two separate loan agreements

[P6 and P7] on 25th February 2004 in respect of each of the above two credit facilities,

with the two Defendants signing on behalf of the Principal Debtor.

4

Guarantee P11 signed by the Defendants

The Plaintiff had stipulated in the said offer letter P5 that the two term loans shall be

further secured by a joint and several guarantee of the Directors of the Principal

Debtor, that being a reference to the Defendants, in a sum of Rs. 220.5 million which

was the aggregate of the monies lent and advanced under the two loan agreements

P6 and P7. In addition to acknowledging the necessity to execute the said guarantee

by placing their signature at the bottom of P5, the consent of the Defendants to

guarantee the said credit facilities is further reflected in the loan agreements P6 and

P7 signed by the Defendants.

On 25th February 2004, the Defendants had executed, (a) a hypothecation bond [P10]

as required by the loan agreement P7, and (b) the joint and several guarantee P11 as

required by the loan agreements P6 and P7. The releasing of the monies under P6 and

P7 had however been delayed as a result of an application being filed to wind up the

Principal Debtor. But with the said application having been withdrawn, the Plaintiff

had released the said sums of money on 20th July 2004, as evidenced by the statement

of account [P11a] and the proceeds thereof had been utilised to settle the previous

loans granted to the Principal Debtor.

Default by the Principal Debtor and action in the Commercial High Court

The Principal Debtor had defaulted payment after having repaid part of the monies

due under P6 and P7. The reason for the default on the part of the Principal Debtor

appears to have been triggered by a further application made in August 2004 to wind

up the Principal Debtor. The order for winding up had been made by the District Court

of Mount Lavinia on 3rd January 2005. Having credited the proceeds realised from the

liquidation of the securities offered under P6 and P7 towards reducing the capital, a

sum of Rs. 164,723,061 under P6 and a sum of Rs. 8,645,267 under P7 were due as at

19th December 2004, together with interest.

By letters dated 10th May 2005 [P14 and P15], the Plaintiff, acting in terms of the

guarantee P11 had demanded from the Defendants the repayment of the

aforementioned outstanding sums of money. As the Defendants neither responded to

the said letters of demand nor repaid the outstanding sums of money or part thereof,

5

the Plaintiff filed action against the Defendants in the Commercial High Court on 18th

January 2006 seeking to recover the following sums of money:

(a) Under the first loan agreement P6, a sum of Rs. 164,723,061 as capital, a further

sum of Rs. 30,589,783 being the interest outstanding as at 20th December 2005,

and interest from that date at the rate of 10% per annum on the capital

outstanding; and

(b) A sum of Rs. 8,645,267 as capital under the second loan agreement P7.

Answer, Issues and Judgment

In their answer, the Defendants denied most of the above factual averments and took

up the position that the plaint had not disclosed a cause of action against them, and

that the Principal Debtor should have been named as a party to the said action. With

the parties having admitted that an order to wind up the Principal Debtor has been

made by the District Court, the Plaintiff had raised sixteen issues while the Defendants

had raised the following four issues:

Although the Defendants did not raise before the Commercial High Court any issue/s

with regard to the aforementioned two questions of law raised before this Court, the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendants submitted that both questions are

pure questions of law and therefore can be raised for the first time in appeal. I am not

entirely in agreement that the said questions are pure questions of law and that they

satisfy the test laid down in Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera Menike v Rohini Senanayake

[(1992) 2 Sri LR 180], Leechman & Company Limited v Rangalla Consolidated Limited

6

[1981] 2 Sri LR 373], Sirimewan Maha Mudalige Kalyani Sirimewan v Herath

Mudiyanselage Gunarath Menike [SC Appeal 47/2017; SC minutes of 10th May 2024]

and referred to in Seeni Pakeer Abdul Raheem and another v Seeni Pakeer Hayath

Mohammed and others [SC Appeal No. 214/2014; SC Minutes of 19th July 2024] for

determining if a question is a pure question of law. Be that as it may, one of the

matters that I shall consider during the course of this judgment is whether in view of

the nature of the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis the failure to raise the

first question of law at the first available opportunity [initio litis] is fatal to the case of

the Defendants.

Pursuant to the raising of issues, the Plaintiff had led the evidence of Harsha

Sakalasuriya, an Executive Officer of the Plaintiff, while the 2nd Defendant gave

evidence on behalf of the Defendants. By its judgment delivered on 12th February

2008, the Commercial High Court held with the Plaintiff and granted the relief prayed

for in the plaint. Aggrieved, the Defendants filed this appeal on 7th April 2008 seeking

to set aside the said judgment of the Commercial High Court.

Suretyship and Guarantee

I would at the outset briefly identify the essence of a suretyship or guarantee by

reference to Sri Lankan, English and South African texts.

K. Balasingham in Institutes of the Laws of Ceylon [The Law of Obligations, Volume 2

(Part I) (1913), pages 253 and 254] citing Voet and Grotius states that, The

engagement of a surety is a contract, by which a person obliges himself on behalf of a

debtor to a creditor for the payment of the whole or part of what is due from such

debtor and by way of accession to his obligation.

According to Law of Guarantees [Geraldine Andrews and Richard Millett, 6th Edition

2011, pages 1 and 2]:

Suretyship is the generic term given to contracts by which one person (the

surety) agrees to answer for some existing or future liability of another (the

principal) to a third person (the creditor), and by which the suretys liability is in

addition to, and not in substitution for, that of the principal

7

Contracts of suretyship fall into two main categories: contracts of guarantee and

contracts of indemnity. Guarantees and indemnities have many similar

characteristics, and similar rights and duties arise between the parties.

Consequently, it is not unusual to find the term guarantee used loosely to

describe a contract which is in reality an indemnity (and vice versa).

In Vossloh AG v Alpha Trains (UK) Ltd [(2010) EWHC 2443 (Ch)] it was observed that:

A contract of suretyship is in essence a contract by which one person, the surety,

agrees to answer for some existing or future liability of another, the principal (or

principal debtor), to a third party, the creditor, and by which the suretys liability

is in addition to, and not in substitution for, the liability of the principal.

[paragraph 21]

A contract of guarantee, in the true sense, is a contract whereby the surety (the

guarantor) promises the creditor to be responsible for the due performance by

the principal of his existing or future obligations to the creditor if the principal

fails to perform them or any of them. [paragraph 23]

In an indemnity, on the other hand, and generally speaking, a primary liability would

fall upon the surety, with liability being wholly independent of any liability which may

arise as between the principal and the creditor.

In Caneys The Law of Suretyship [5th Edition, 2002, page 27] the author describes a

suretyship in the following manner:

Suretyship is an accessory contract by which a person (the surety) undertakes to

the creditor of another (the principal debtor) primarily, that the principal debtor,

who remains bound, will perform his obligation to the creditor and secondarily,

that if and so far as the principal debtor fails to do so, the surety will perform it

or, failing that, indemnify the creditor..

The author thereafter proceeds to point out [supra; page 32] that the concepts of

suretyship and guarantee have been referred to interchangeably in its 1st and 2nd

editions but had stated that this usage has been subjected to growing and justified

criticism. The author thereafter discusses the differences between a guarantee and a

8

surety bond and points out that it remains difficult to tell them apart particularly

where the event guaranteed is the performance of a contractual obligation.

A similar view has been expressed in Vossloh AG v Alpha Trains (UK) Ltd [supra;

paragraph 20] in the following manner:

Contracts of suretyship are an area of law bedevilled by imprecise terminology

and where therefore it is important not to confuse the label given by the parties

to the suretys obligation (although the label may be indicative of what the

parties intend) with the substance of that obligation. Because the parties are free

to make any agreement they like, each case must depend upon the true

construction of the actual words in which the suretys obligation is expressed. This

involves construing the instrument in its factual and contractual context having

regard to its commercial purpose, a task which the court approaches by looking

at it as a whole without any preconception as to what it is.

The above position has been clearly laid down in Peoples Bank v Fawzia Nizam and

others [SC (CHC) Appeal No. 5/2007; SC Minutes of 2nd August 2024] where Janak De

Silva, J stated that, Accordingly, the true nature of the relationship between the

Appellant and the Respondents and their respective rights and liabilities must be

determined by an examination of the Guarantee. In construing the Guarantee, we must

not apply to it merely technical rules but must interpret it so as to reflect what may

fairly be inferred to be the parties real intention and understanding as expressed by

them in the agreement [Peerylease Ltd. v. Imecar AG [(1988) 1 WLR 463 at 469H-470A].

It must be construed by looking at it as a whole without preconceptions as to what it

is.

Thus, irrespective of the terminology used, the essence of the arrangement is that the

surety gives an undertaking to a third party [creditor] on behalf of another party

[debtor] that it will perform the obligations owed by the debtor to the creditor in the

event of the debtor not fulfilling its obligations to the creditor.

P11 Guarantee

Thus, while the nomenclature is not determinative of its true character, it is noted that

P11 which is titled Guarantee, identifies Seneviratne Trading Company (Private)

Limited as the debtor, and goes on to record in page 3 as follows:

In consideration of the Bank at our request agreeing not to require immediate

payment of such of the moneys herein mentioned as may be now due and/or in

consideration of any moneys herein mentioned which the Bank may hereafter

advance or pay or which may hereafter become due, we the undersigned

(a) Gamini Seneviratne

of Shalawa Road, Udahamulla, Nugegoda.

(b) Sujith Nishantha Seneviratne

of Shalawa Road, Udahamulla, Nugegoda.

hereby agree (to) pay to the Bank in Colombo the moneys herein mentioned ten

days after demand in writing is made on us

Provided always that the total liability ultimately enforceable against us under

this guarantee shall not exceed Rupees Two Hundred and Twenty Million Five

Hundred Thousand Only (Rs. 220,500,000/-), together with all interest thereon

computed from the date on which such demand in writing shall have been made

by the Bank and at such rate or rates as may be fixed or determined from time to

time by the General Manager of the Colombo office of the Bank or other officer

duly authorized in that behalf from time to time and such further sums by way of

handling charges, commitment charges, Bankers charges and expenses as shall

accrue all in accordance with the banks usual course of business and also all legal

costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Bank.[emphasis added]

Two things are clear from the above provision. The first is that the Defendants have

undertaken to honour the liabilities of the Principal Debtor under and in terms of P6

and P7. The second is that the Defendants have acknowledged that while immediate

payment of such of the moneys is not required, they are obliged to pay within ten days

after [the] demand in writing. This provision has a direct nexus to the first question of

10

law raised as to whether the Plaintiff cannot proceed against the Defendants until and

unless the Principal Debtor has been excussed.

Evolution of the principle of excussion Bearing in mind that both questions of law revolve around excussion and that Clause

18 of P11, to which I shall advert to later, contains a renunciation on the part of the

Defendants of the privileges or defences that a surety is entitled to, I shall briefly refer

to the evolution of the principle of excussion under Roman Law culminating with its

position under the Roman Dutch law.

In Millman and another v Masterbond Participation Bond Trust Managers (Pty)

Limited (under curatorship) and others [1997 (1) SA 113 (C)], the Cape Provincial

Division has traced the roots of excussion as follows:

In Roman law as Professor R Zimmermann explains in The Law of Obligations,

Roman Foundations of the Civilian Tradition at 130:

'(T)hroughout the classical period and up to the time of Justinian, the debtor

and his surety were liable on an equal footing and not the one only if

satisfaction could not be obtained from the other: in other words, the creditor

was free to choose whom of the two he wanted to sue first. And yet, this

statement has to be qualified to a certain extent: it is correct, as far as the

strictly legal side of things was concerned; in actual practice, however, the

surety was what he was (arguably) only intended to be, namely a subsidiary

debtor.'

The Emperor Justinian went further and, by an enactment contained in Novellae

4,1 introduced the so-called benefit of excussion, or order (beneficium excussionis

vel ordinis), which enabled a surety to insist that the creditor sue the principal

debtor first before seeking to recover from him. As Professor Zimmermann (op cit

at 129) points out, 'with this enactment the liability of the surety became

subsidiary'. Roman law appears to have recognised the power of a surety, by pact,

to renounce the benefits to which he was entitled:

11

De Groot deals with the matter in a passage in his Inleiding tot de Hollandsche

Rechtsgeleertheyt 3.3 27-29, which reads as follows (Lee's translation at 319):

'27. By a law of the Emperor Justinian a surety acquired the right to keep the

creditor at arm's length until he had excussed the principal debtor; provided

that, in case the principal debtor is outside the jurisdiction, the surety shall

have a reasonable time appointed him to bring the principal debtor before the

Court; and in case after excussing the principal debtor the creditor's claim is

not entirely satisfied he may then have recourse against the surety.

29. Both these benefits, viz under the law of Justinian and under the law of

Hadrian, do not avail those who, with full knowledge, have renounced them,

or who have neglected to plead them. '

The present position on excussion In Wessels Law of Contract in South Africa [Volume II, 2nd ed., 1951], the author has

set out the present position as follows [pages 1011 1014]:

When the debtor is in default the creditor is entitled to demand payment from

the surety.

... the mere default of the debtor does not as a rule entitle the creditor to proceed

against the surety. The principal debtor must not only first be sued, but he must

also be excussed, and only after this can the surety be called upon to pay the

balance due. Hence, if a surety is sued before the principal debtor, he may

advance as an exception or defence the beneficium ordinis seu excussionis that

the principal debtor be first excussed before payment is demanded of the surety.

[emphasis added]

It has been pointed out in Willes Principles of South African Law [9th edition, 2007,

page 1023] that, The surety may claim that the principal debtor be first excussed,

i.e. that the creditor, before suing the surety, exhaust the creditors legal remedies

against the principal debtor for performance or payment, up to execution against the

principal debtors property. [Grotius 3.3.27; Voet 46.1.14]. [emphasis added]

12

In Maasdorps The Institutes of Cape Law [Volume I, The Law of Obligation, at page

359], it is stated that:

The benefit of excussion, as known to our law, is the right of exception to which

a security is entitled, who is being sued before the principal debtor, to demand

that the principal shall first be sued and excussed; [Voet 46:1:14; Grotius 3:3:27]

and, where there are more than one principal debtor, that all shall be excussed.

It further entitles the surety, where an obligation has been secured as well by the

giving of sureties as by a mortgage on immovable property, to claim that the

immovable property shall also be excussed before he is himself proceeded

against.

The following useful description of the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis is

found in Caneys The Law of Suretyship [supra; at page 119]

The benefit of excussion, or discussion as it is sometimes called (beneficium

ordinis seu excussionis), is the right of the surety against the creditor to have him

proceed first against the principal debtor with a view to obtaining payment from

him, if necessary by execution upon his assets, before turning to the surety for

payment of the debtor or of so much of it as it remains unpaid.

The word ordinis in the term beneficium ordinis seu excussionis relates to the

order in which the creditor may pursue his remedies, first against the principal

debtor and thereafter against the surety. That the creditor is to excuss the assets

of the debtor before turning to the surety is expressed in the word excussionis,

which sometimes appears as discussionis.

The resultant position then is that under the Roman Dutch law, the creditors first

recourse is to the principal debtor, and the surety becomes liable only once the

principal debtor has been excussed. Where that has not been done, and subject to

certain limitations, the surety shall be entitled to take up the defence that the principal

debtor be excussed prior to proceeding against the surety. What is significant however

is that this defence can be renounced by the surety. It is the legal basis of such

renunciation and whether the renunciation as contained in Clause 18 [and Clause 19]

in P11 is valid and enforceable that forms the basis for the aforementioned second

question of law.

13

Winding up of the principal debtor

In Willes Principles of South African Law [supra; page 1020], the author has referred

to three instances where the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis shall not

succeed.

The first is, if the principal debtors estate has been sequestered, or likewise, where

the principal debtor, being a company, has been liquidated on the ground that it is

unable to pay its debts. I have already referred to the fact that an order for the winding

up of the Principal Debtor has been made by the District Court of Mount Lavinia prior

to the filing of this action in the Commercial High Court. The question of pursuing and

excussing the principal debtor therefore does not arise, and this appeal is liable to be

rejected, on that ground alone.

Dilatory plea and litis initio The second instance cited in Willes where the defence would shall not succeed, based

on the works of Grotius and Voet, is where in an action by the creditor against the

surety, the latter fails to plead the benefit before litis contestatio i.e., before the

close of the pleadings.

K. Balasingham in Institutes of the Laws of Ceylon [supra; pages 262-263] has stated

as follows:

The beneficium ordinis seu excussionis whereby a surety may throw the creditor,

when he demands payment, first upon the goods of the principal debtor. This

privilege, however is in general expressly renounced by the surety in the deed

itself, and it is also held to be tacitly renounced when he constitutes himself surety

as principal.

A surety who has not renounced the benefit, can take the exception when sued.

The exception is of the class of dilatory exceptions and only tends to put off the

action of the creditor against the surety until after the time of discussion. After

the principal debtor has been excussed, recourse may be had against the surety

for any balance that may not have been recovered from the principal. The

exception ought to be taken before the litis contestatio.

14

The creditor is only obliged to discuss the principal debtor before he proceeds

further against the surety, when the surety demands it and opposes the

exception of excussion; therefore, although the creditor has not discussed the

principal debtor, his demand and his pursuits against the surety are regular, until

the surety opposes the exception. [emphasis added]

In Wijeyewardene v Jayawardene [19 NLR 449; at page 460] Justice De Sampayo

stated that:

The benefit of excussion furnishes only a dilatory plea, and is lost if it be not

pleaded before the litis contestatio, which with us may be for this regarded as

taking place on the filing of the answer. The creditor is not wrong in bringing the

action against the surety in the first instance, since he is not supposed to know

whether the plea will be taken or not, and consequently the result of a successful

plea will be only to suspend further proceedings until the principal debtor is sued

and his property discussed. [emphasis added]

This position is elaborately set out in Caneys The Law of Suretyship [supra; page 121]

in the following manner:

Although sureties have the benefit of excussion the creditor is not obliged to

proceed first against the principal debtor unless the surety avails himself of the

benefit; it is a dilatory defence which the surety may elect to set up if the creditor

first sues him. If the surety intends to raise the defence, he must do so in initio

litis; it is too late to raise it after litis contestatio. It certainly cannot be raised for

the first time on appeal. If the surety disputes liability as a surety, denying the

very existence of a suretyship contract, he should nevertheless raise in initio litis

the plea of non-excussion; If the defence of non-excussion succeeds, the court

may postpone the proceedings pending excussion of the principal debtor or, in a

proper case, grant absolution against the creditor. [emphasis added]

The rationale for this requirement has been explained in Wessels in the following

manner: [supra; page 1015-1016]

15

The suretys obligation to the creditor is not conditional but an absolute one, and

the benefit of excussion is a privilege. It is therefore incumbent on the surety to

claim this privilege in limine litis [Voet 46.1.15]. If he fails to do so, he will be

condemned to pay, but if he claims the benefit the creditor is bound to excuss. A

defendant therefore cannot demand absolution from the instance merely

because the plaintiff has not proved that the benefit was renounced. But if the

benefit is claimed, the Court may grant absolution.

All our law requires is that the surety shall signify that he intends to avail himself

of his privilege.

It follows from the rule that the exception must be taken initio litis, that a surety

who has not claimed the benefit of excussion in the court of first instance cannot

take advantage of it on appeal. [emphasis added]

The defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis is therefore not an absolute

prohibition that prevents a creditor from pursuing a surety prior to pursuing the

principal debtor. It is only a dilatory plea, and must therefore be raised at the earliest

stage of an action. It being so, it is clear from the issues raised by the Defendants, to

which I have already referred, that the questions of law raised before this Court were

not raised before the Commercial High Court.

The first question of law raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendants

was whether in terms of the law relating to sureties/guarantors and the provisions of

the guarantee P11, the Plaintiff was required to proceed against the Principal Debtor

in the first instance, and if so, whether the Plaintiff can proceed against the Defendants

only after the Principal Debtor has been excussed. Having taken into consideration the

matters that I have referred to and provided the order for the winding up of the

Principal Debtor had not been made, I am of the view that it was open to the Plaintiff

to have filed action against the Defendants without having excussed the Principal

Debtor. It was thereafter the responsibility of the Defendants to have taken up initio

litis the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis, which would have enabled the

Court to lay by the case until the Principal Debtor had been excussed. The Defendants

did not do so and given the fact that the said defence is a dilatory plea, I am of the

view that the Defendants cannot raise the first question of law at this stage of the case.

16

I must perhaps state at this point that the necessity for the Plaintiff to have first

proceeded against the principal debtor does not arise where a surety undertakes

liability as co-principal debtor, as well. While this is the case in terms of P11 and is a

matter that I shall discuss at the end of the judgment, on this basis too, the first

question of law must be answered against the Defendants.

Renunciation of the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis This brings me to the third instance cited by Willes where the defence of beneficium

ordinis seu excussionis shall not succeed. This ground, which too is based on the works

of Grotius and Voet, is where the benefit has been renounced by the surety either

expressly, or impliedly, e.g., where the surety becomes, or signs the suretyship

agreement as surety and principal debtor or as surety and co-principal debtor.

A further situation, which probably can be described as an implied renunciation, has

been cited by Wessels [supra; page 1019] as follows:

The benefit may, however, be renounced tacitly, but this tacit renunciation must

not be confused with a general renunciation. If the circumstances show that the

surety must have intended to renounce this particular benefit, it is as effective

a renunciation as if he had done so in express terms (Voet, 46.1.16). If, therefore,

it appears from the suretyship bond that its very object was that the creditor

should have recourse to the surety the moment the debtor made the default, then

the Court will infer a tacit renunciation of the benefit. [emphasis added]

The obligation on the part of the Defendants in terms of P11 to pay within ten days

after the demand in writing is evidence of a tacit renunciation and negates the need

to excuss the principal debtor prior to proceeding against the Defendants.

I shall now consider if Clause 18, which forms the basis for the second question of law,

contains an express and/or general renunciation, as well as whether Clause 18 and/or

Clause 19 of P11 and/or the provisions of P11 taken as a whole, amounts to an implied

or tacit renunciation of the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis.

17

Clause 18 of P11 and its validity

Clause 18 reads as follows:

We specifically agree that the Bank shall be at liberty either in one action to sue

the debtor and us and each any one of us jointly or severally or to proceed in the

first instance against me/us only, and further that we hereby renounce the right

to claim that the debtor should be excussed or proceeded against by action in

the first instance, and (where this guarantee is given by more than one person)

the right to claim that the Bank should divide its claim against us and bring

actions against us, each for his portion pro rata, and the right to claim in any

action brought against all of us that the Bank should only recover from each of us

a pro rata share of the amount claimed in that action, and all other rights,

privileges and benefits whatsoever nothing excepted to which sureties are or may

be entitled to at law or equity.

IT BEING AGREED that we and each of us are and is liable in all respects hereunder

not merely as surety or sureties or guarantor or guarantors but as sole or principal

debtor or where this guarantee is signed or executed by more than one person as

sole or principal debtors jointly and severally, to the extent aforementioned,

including the liability to be solely sued, before recourse is had against the debtor,

or without any recourse whatsoever being had to the debtor for any reason or

cause whatsoever and in the absolute discretion of the Bank.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendants whilst conceding that the above

Clause amounts to a renunciation, submitted that the said renunciation is not valid,

for the following reasons:

(a) A renunciation must be expressly stated, and must be specific;

(b) A general renunciation would not suffice;

(c) A renunciation must be explained to the surety and it is the responsibility of the

beneficiary to ensure that the surety has full knowledge of such renunciation.

18

The learned Presidents Counsel relied on two judgments of this Court in support of

his submissions.

Wijeyewardene v Jayawardene The first is Wijeyewardene v Jayawardene [supra]. In that case, the plaintiff

Wijeyewardene sued for the recovery of a sum of money alleged to be due to him from

the Ceylonese Union Company Limited whose debt to the plaintiff was secured by the

defendant under a deed. The defendant pleaded as a matter of law that the action

was not maintainable unless and until the plaintiff had sued, and had failed to recover

the amount claimed from the Ceylonese Union Company Limited.

After reciting the indebtedness of the company to the plaintiff, clause 4 of the deed

provided that, In order to give full effect to the provisions of this guarantee, the said

(defendant) doth hereby expressly waive all suretyship and other rights inconsistent

with such provisions, and which he might otherwise be entitled to claim and

enforce. [emphasis added]

The District Court held in favour of the defendant and ordered the plaintiff's action to

stand out of the trial roll till he had sued the Ceylonese Union Company and failed to

recover from the said company the amount of his claim. On appeal to the Supreme

Court, the question was whether clause 4 was a sufficient waiver of the defence that

was available to the defendant that the principal debtor be excussed prior to

proceeding against the defendant. The case was heard before a bench comprising of

Chief Justice Wood Renton and Justice Thomas De Sampayo, who delivered separate

opinions, with both upholding the objection raised by the defendant.

Judgment of Chief Justice Wood Renton Although lengthy but in order to give context to the submissions of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Defendants, I re-produce below in its entirety the

discussion that Chief Justice Wood-Renton engaged in, in considering whether clause

4 was a sufficient waiver of the said defence.

The question then arises whether, assuming that deed No. 5279 is only a

contract of guarantee, and that the defendant has not bound himself as co-

principal debtor, he is debarred from relying on the beneficium ordinis by the

19

stipulation in the deed that he expressly waives all suretyship and other rights

which are inconsistent with its terms, and which he might otherwise be entitled

to enforce. The learned District Judge has held that, as there is in the stipulation

just mentioned no express renunciation of the beneficium ordinis, the

defendant has not effectually renounced that privilege, and, therefore, that the

plaintiff cannot proceed with his action against the defendant till he has discussed

the Ceylonese Union Company. The District Judge has accordingly directed that

the present action shall stand out of the trial roll until the plaintiff has sued the

principal debtors and has failed to recover from them the amount of his claim. I

may say at once that, if the view taken by the District Judge of the law applicable

to this part of the case is correct, I see no objection to the present action being

allowed to stand over till the plaintiff's action against the company has been

determined.

There is little, if any, local authority upon the question of the form in which in this

Colony the special privileges accorded by the law to sureties must be renounced,

and it may be convenient, therefore, to consider the subject on general lines. The

three main privileges which a surety, who is not also a co-principal debtor, enjoys

are the beneficium ordinis seu excussionis, by which he is entitled to claim that,

as his liability is of an accessory character, it shall not be enforced against him

until the creditor has unsuccessfully endeavoured to obtain satisfaction from the

principal debtor; the beneficium divisionis, which provides for the apportionment

of liability among the co-sureties; and the beneficium cedendarum actionum,

which secures the right of a surety who has discharged his principal's

indebtedness to a cession of any rights of action against the principal debtor that

the creditor may possess. The beneficium ordinis, restoring, as he alleged, the

older law on the subject, which had fallen into disuse, was conceded by

Justinian. The beneficium divisionis was introduced by Hadrian. The beneficium

cedendarum actionum is recognized both in the Digest and in the Code. There is

a conflict of opinion among jurists as to the mode in which these privileges, which

were duly incorporated into Roman-Dutch law, should be renounced. According

to Voet an express and special renunciation was necessary "

It was not sufficient that the surety should renounce one of the beneficia by

name The same view is taken by Grotius, by Van Leeuwen, and by Perezius. In

20

Censura Forensis Van Leeuwen deals with the matter thus: "But ought these

renunciations to be made expressly and specifically? Although some think that

they are sufficiently renounced by a general clause, including all the privileges, or

the individual privileges, which accrue to sureties, and can accrue to them; in

practice, nevertheless, it has been accepted that a general renunciation of all

privileges is not sufficient, but that they must be expressly and specifically given

up, since they are of the nature and substance of the act itself; and inasmuch as

general clauses of renunciation of this kind are generally, according to the custom

of unskilled notaries, inserted where they do not belong in their documents,

without the knowledge of, and notice to, the parties.

"And therefore these renunciations, although they have been expressly and

specifically made, do not hold good unless the sureties (because they are looked

upon as of difficult and recondite law, and as easily escaping the notice of any

one) have been informed of them, and had them explained. This is so much the

case that the omission to give the information vitiates the renunciation. Especially

is this so with us, with whom these privileges are almost useless and of no effect,

owing to the customary form used by our notaries, who scarcely ever omit to say

that the surety has renounced the beneficium ordinis divisionis et excussionis."

A different view of the law, however, commended itself to Van der Keessel "

Burge, in his treatise on Suretyship, associates himself with this statement: "In

the writings of many jurists, and amongst them J. Voet, it is said that a general

renunciation of all privileges is not sufficient; but the better opinion seems to be

that, where the renunciation is expressed to be of all privileges competent to

sureties, it extends to this as well as the other privileges on which the surety would

be otherwise entitled to insist."

In spite, however, of the opinion of Van der Keessel and Burge, Kotze, C.J., in his

note on the relevant passage in Van Leeuwen's Commentaries says that the

weight of authority is on the other side, and that view appears to have been

adopted in the South African Courts.

Speaking for myself, I think that we should follow in this Colony the general rule

affirmed by Voet, Grotius, Van Leeuwen, and Perezius, and sanctioned by South

21

African practice, that the ordinary privileges of suretyship must be specially

renounced. In that case the renunciation by the defendant in deed No. 5279 of

his rights as a surety would clearly be inoperative. But even if we adopt the view

of Van der Keessel the present appeal would still fail. For the efficacy of the

general renunciation depends on whether the surety, not being peritus juris, is

proved affirmatively to have understood the nature of the right or rights

renounced, , I would hold that the surety's knowledge on that vital point must

appear on the face of the deed of suretyship itself.[page 456; emphasis added]

It was therefore the position of Chief Justice Wood Renton that an express waiver of

all suretyship rights by specific reference to such rights is required, and that even if a

general renunciation is to be accepted as being sufficient, it must be established that

the surety renounced his rights knowingly.

Judgment of Justice De Sampayo The opinion expressed by Justice De Sampayo is set out below, and is further

illustrative of this issue:

The defendant has taken the legal exception that the plaintiff cannot sue him

unless and until the plaintiff has sued and failed to recover the sum claimed from

the company. This in effect is the plea of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis

available to a surety under the Roman-Dutch law. But two other questions have

to be considered, namely, (1) whether, in view of the nature of the objection

undertaken by the defendant, it was necessary, in order to sue the defendant,

without first suing the principal, the company, that he should have renounced the

benefits competent to sureties; and (2) whether, if so, there is a sufficient

renunciation of them in the bond. [pages 457 and 458; emphasis added]

A renunciation being stricti juris will not be presumed, but must be express.

This is a proposition universally accepted. But all the Roman-Dutch jurists draw

a distinction between a tacit and an express renunciation. The principal example

of tacit renunciation is the case where the surety binds himself tanquam

principalem. The first question in this case, then, is whether the defendant

though surety has bound himself to the plaintiff as principal co-debtor. Having

22

carefully read the whole instrument, I have come to the conclusion that he has

not done so.[page 458; emphasis added]

Whether the property of the principal debtor has been sufficiently excussed is a

question of fact, on the determination of which the court may overrule the plea

taken by the surety

The remaining question is whether the privileges allowed by law to sureties have

been sufficiently renounced by the defendant. It will be noticed that none of

them are specified in the surety bond, and that there is only a general

renunciation, as the fourth clause puts it, of "all suretyship and other rights."

There appears to be some difference of opinion among Roman-Dutch jurists as to

the effect of a general renunciation. The general principle appears to be that,

when a surety makes a renunciation, he must do so deliberately and with full

knowledge of his rights, and so Voet (46.1.16), Van Leeuwen's Commentaries

(4.4.12), and other jurists lay down an inflexible rule that the privileges must be

renounced specifically and by name. Kotze's Note to Van Leeuwen, of his

translation, Nathan's Common Law of South Africa and Maasdorp's Institutes,

(Vol. Ill,, p. 364), show that in South Africa this rule has been adopted as

expressing the weightier opinion among jurists. On the other hand, Burge on

Suretyship citing Herengius de Fidej says that the better opinion is that, where

the renunciation is expressed to be of all privileges competent to sureties as

distinguished from privileges simpliciter, the privilege of excussion and the other

privileges of sureties are sufficiently renounced. But I am not aware of any local

decision or established practice contrary to the rule laid down by the authorities

above referred to, and I think that we should follow the law accepted in modern

times by so many eminent Roman-Dutch lawyers and commentators. Van der

Keessel's Thesis, to which also Burge refers, does not seem to me to go so far as

Burge himself, ." Van der Keessel appears to me to allow the validity of a

general renunciation, provided that the surety who makes it is himself a lawyer,

or declares that he has full knowledge of the rights he is so renouncing. Van der

Keessel undoubtedly is one of the greatest exponents of the Roman-Dutch law,

and his opinion is of special value to us, as his Theses were published at the very

time when Ceylon passed into British hands. But, in order to give effect to his view,

the condition on which he insists should at least be fulfilled. The defendant in this

23

case is not a lawyer, nor has he made any declaration that he knew the privileges

which he waived. It was said at the argument that he must be presumed to have

known them, inasmuch as the notary who drew up and attested the bond must

be taken to have explained these things. This, even if it happened, would not

satisfy the condition which seems to require that the surety should actually

understand the matter and make a declaration to that effect. I do not think

that the plaintiff is able to rely upon the authority of Van der Keessel. [pages

459-460; emphasis added]

Amerasinghe v Perera

The judgment in Wijeyewardene was followed in Amerasinghe v Perera [35 NLR 306].

In that case, by a bond bearing No. 5612 dated 18th July 1928, the 1st defendant as

principal and the 2nd and 3rd defendants as sureties bound themselves to pay to the

plaintiff and one Cecilia Fernando or either of them the sum of Rs. 1,750 with interest

at 13.5 per cent, per annum. The bond shows that the 2nd and 3rd defendants bound

themselves in terms "as sureties hereto for further securing the payment of principal

and interest, we hereby renouncing the benefits which sureties are legally entitled to

and also without distinction as to debtor or surety."

Commenting on the said clause, Senior Puisne Justice Garvin stated as follows:

The passage is not well drafted but it is reasonably clear that though the 2nd and

3rd defendants bound themselves as sureties they renounced all the benefits

appertaining to persons who become sureties so that there should be in the

matter of the obligation created by the bond no distinction between the principal

debtor and the sureties. It is apparently in this view the District Judge held that

the 2nd and 3rd defendants were in effect principal debtors on the bond.

Although the interpretation of the language employed discloses an intention on

the part of the sureties to renounce all the benefits to which sureties are entitled,

it is well settled that such a general renunciation is insufficient in law unless the

surety who makes it is himself a lawyer or declares in the writing that he has

full knowledge of the rights he is so renouncing - vide Wijeyewardene v.

Jayawardene [19 NLR 449].

24

There is here no such declaration nor have the privileges been specifically

renounced. There is therefore nothing to prevent the 2nd and 3rd defendants

claiming all or any of the benefits to which they as sureties are in law entitled.

[emphasis added]

The above judgment was followed by Soertsz, AJ, in Pandithan Chettiar v.

Singhappuhamy [37 NLR 310].

The position since Wijeyewardene

I must state that the above judgment of Chief Justice Wood Renton (and Justice De

Sampayo) was set aside by the Privy Council in Wijeyewardene v Jayawardene [26

NLR 193] on the basis that the defendant was liable as a co-debtor and not only as a

surety, and hence there was no need to have excussed the principal debtor. However,

the opinion of the Privy Council has not commented upon the aforementioned findings

on beneficium ordinis seu excussionis.

The findings of Chief Justice Wood Renton and Justice De Sampayo have gradually lost

its significance, with the first step in that regard being taken by Justice De Sampayo

himself in Singer Sewing Machine Co. v Silva [5 CWR 205], delivered less than one year

after the judgment in Wijeyewardene. In that case, the defendant who had

guaranteed the repayment of the monies due under a hire purchase agreement had

pleaded that no action is maintainable against him unless the principal debtor is first

sued. The question was whether the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis

available to a surety had been sufficiently renounced by the defendant.

Justice De Sampayo held as follows:

The law bearing on this matter has been fully discussed in Wijeyewardene v

Jayawardene [19 NLR 449], from which it will appear that in order to entitle the

creditor to go in the first instance against the surety, the privilege in question

must be expressly and specifically renounced by the surety. In the present

instance the contract contains a clause by which the defendant as guarantor

agrees that the owners (the plaintiff company) are at liberty to sue at their

option either the hirer or guarantor jointly or severally for their dues.

25

This of course necessarily means that the plaintiff company may at their option

sue the defendant, though he is only surety, without or before suing the hirer or

principal debtor, and clearly amounts to an express and specific renunciation of

the beneficium ordinis seu excussionis. I think the Commissioner is right in

deciding the legal issue against the defendant. [emphasis added]

The express reference to the creditors right to sue either the principal debtor or

guarantor jointly or severally at his option, was thus held by Justice De Sampayo to be

sufficiently specific.

Chief Justice H.N.G. Fernando had the opportunity of considering both judgments of

Justice De Sampayo in Mercantile Credit Ltd v B.H. Silva [76 NLR 193], where he held

as follows:

The 2nd defendant also pleaded in his answer that he did not know that he was

expressly renouncing the benefits to which sureties are entitled, and if this plea is

to succeed, there cannot be recourse against the 2nd defendant except if recourse

against the 1st defendant does not satisfy the plaintiffs claim. The learned District

Judge does not reach a finding on this plea, but the context in which he cites from

the judgment in Wijeyewardene v. Jayawardene (19 NLR 449), indicates that he

might have been inclined to uphold this plea. In that case de Sampayo J referred

to an argument that a surety must be presumed to have known the effect of his

declaration in a bond, as the Notary who drew up the Bond must be taken to

explain these things, and then observed this, even if it happened, would not

satisfy the condition which seems to require that the surety should actually

understand the matter and make a declaration to that effect.

The Agreement in the instant case contains the following declaration:

The Guarantor hereby renounces the rights to claim that the Hirer should

be excussed in the first instance and all other benefits to which sureties are

by law entitled, it being agreed that he is liable, in all respects under this

Agreement, to the same extent and in the same manner as the Hirer

including the liability to be sued before recourse is had to the Hirer.

26

But there is no declaration in the Agreement to the effect that the 2nd defendant

actually understood the nature of the right which he purported to renounce. To

that extent the Agreement does not appear to satisfy the test laid down by de

Sampayo J. Nevertheless the same Judge, only a short while after the previous

decision, considered the terms of a guarantee in a hire-purchase contract

(Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Silva, 5 CWR 205). Having referred to the full

discussion of the subject in the earlier decision, de Sampayo J. in the later case

pointed out that the contract contained a clause by which the defendant agrees

that the owners are at liberty to sue at their option either the hirer or

guarantor jointly or severally for their dues, and he proceeded to hold that this

was an express and specific renunciation of the beneficium ordinis seu

excussionis.

It seems to me that the later decision distinguished the earlier case of

Wijeyewardene v. Jayawardene. In the earlier case there was no clause in the

bond corresponding to that which was contained in the hire-purchase agreement

in the Singer Sewing Machine Co. case. In the instant case, the 2nd defendant did

not give evidence, and there was no ground upon which to counter the natural

inference that he understood the meaning of the declaration which he signed.

Moreover, the renunciation clause is in clearer terms than the clause in the

Singer Sewing Machine Co. case. As at present advised therefore, I think we

should apply the later decision of de Sampayo J. [pages 201 and 202; emphasis

added]

The final judgment that I wish to refer in arriving at the present position of the law is

the minority opinion of Chitrasiri,J in Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation v Peoples Bank

[SC (CHC) Appeal No. 18/2009; SC Minutes of 17th March 2017], where he has

summarised in the following manner the validity of a renunciation of the defence of

beneficium ordinis seu excussionis:

Accordingly, the question on which this appeal should be decided is to ascertain

whether the Surety has, in fact, renounced the aforesaid right of excussion and/or

accepted liability as a Principal Debtor and/or agreed that the Creditor may sue

the Surety for the recovery of the monies due without proceeding against the

Principal Debtor, knowing the effect of the renunciation. I do not see any

27

material in this instance to show that the surety namely the defendant Insurance

Corporation has made such a renouncement of its right of excussion and/or

accepted liability as a Principal Debtor and/or agreed that the Creditor may sue

the Surety for the recovery of the monies due, without proceeding against the

Principal Debtor, knowing the effect of the renunciation. Therefore, the Plaintiff

Bank will have to first file action against the principal debtor namely BAT

International Company, before proceeding against the Insurance Corporation, it

being the guarantor.

The present position regarding the renunciation of the defence of beneficium ordinis

seu excussionis could therefore be summarised as follows:

(1) A renunciation which is express or specific shall be valid;

(2) A general renunciation would also be valid where:

(a) the surety himself is an Attorney-at-Law; or

(b) the effect of such renunciation has been explained to the surety by the

beneficiary, or in the alternative, the knowledge of the surety of such

renunciation is clear from the face of the document itself, with the burden

of proving otherwise being with the surety. I must perhaps add that there

is no need for a renunciation clause to be explained to the sureties by an

Attorney-at-Law.

(3) There is an implied or tacit renunciation where inter alia the surety signs as a co-

principal debtor or undertakes to pay any sum on demand or agrees to action

being filed against the principal debtor and the surety together.

I shall now consider if the Defendants have renounced the defence of beneficium

ordinis seu excussionis in one or more of the above modes.

P11 express and specific renunciation

I have already stated that the first basis for the second question of law raised by the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendants that P11 is not valid and enforceable

is that there is no express and specific renunciation of the defence in P11. It might

28

perhaps be important to bear in mind that the impugned clause in Wijeyewardene v

Jayawardene [supra] only provided that all suretyship and other rights which sureties

are entitled to claim and enforce are being waived, and that there was neither a

reference to such rights by name nor an explanation as to what those rights might be.

Having carefully considered Clause 18 of P11, I am of the view that the use of the

following words in Clause 18 makes it abundantly clear that the Defendants have

expressly and specifically renounced their right that the Plaintiff must proceed against

the Principal Debtor in the first instance:

(a) The Bank shall be at liberty to proceed in the first instance against us only;

(b) We hereby renounce the right to claim that the debtor should be excussed or

proceeded against by action in the first instance;

(c) We and each of us are liable in all respects hereunder [not merely as surety or

sureties or guarantor or guarantors but as sole or principal debtor , including

the liability to be solely sued,] before recourse is had against the debtor, or

without any recourse whatsoever being had to the debtor for any reason or cause

whatsoever and in the absolute discretion of the Bank.

My view is fortified by Clause 19, re-produced below, by which the Defendants had

agreed that the Plaintiff shall be at liberty to sue the Defendants directly, without suing

the Principal Debtor:

As separate and independent stipulation/s we and each of us jointly and

severally or separately hereby agree and undertake that the moneys herein

mentioned or such part thereof which may not be recoverable from us or any of

us on the footing of the instrument above written whether by reason of any

disability or incapacity on or of the debtor or any other fact or circumstance

whatsoever and whether known to the Bank or not or by reason of the operation

of any rule or law or equity relating to sureties or guarantors shall nevertheless

be recoverable from us and each of us jointly and severally or separately as sole

or principal debtor or debtors in respect thereof and shall be payable by me/us

and each of us jointly and severally or separately to the Bank at Colombo ten days

after demand in writing as aforesaid and for the purpose of the Bank enforcing

29

the liability created by this cause, the Bank shall be entitled to exercise and adopt

all or any of the rights, powers, privileges and benefits conferred on the Bank by

the other provisions contained in this instrument. [emphasis added]

In these circumstances, I see no merit in the submission that P11 does not contain an

express or specific renunciation of the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis.

Accordingly, the first basis for the second question of law must necessarily fail.

P11 general renunciation In addition to the above express and specific renunciation, Clause 18 contains a

general renunciation to the effect that all other rights, privileges and benefits

whatsoever nothing excepted to which sureties are or may be entitled to at law or

equity are being renounced. If Clause 18 was limited to this general renunciation, and

in the absence of Clause 19, and given that none of the Defendants are Attorneys-at-

Law, this Court would have to be satisfied that the Defendants properly understood

what was being renounced. This was the second basis for the second question of law

presented by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendants that the renunciation

of the defence is not valid or enforceable, with the Defendants taking up the position

that they were not made aware of such renunciation by the Plaintiff at the time P11

was executed.

Creating awareness on the part of the Defendants of such renunciation can be done in

one of two ways. The first is for the explanation of the renunciation of the defence to

be clearly set out in the guarantee itself, as was the case in Seneviratne and

Seneviratne v State Bank of India [SC (CHC) Appeal No. 53/2006; SC Minutes of 11th

December 2014]. The second is by having the relevant provision in plain and simple

language, as has been done in this case. Clauses 18 and 19, which are the relevant

provisions, do not refer to the defences by their Latin terminology but are in plain and

simple English which is easily understandable by any person and especially the

Defendants who had executed guarantees prior to P11. The Defendants were men of

commerce who had transacted with the Plaintiff for a long period of time, and the

effect and consequence of the renunciation is clearly borne out by P11.

30

Burden of proof In any event, it is safe to assume that the Defendants had the requisite knowledge of

the effect and consequences of such renunciation. The burden of proving that, (a) they

were not made aware of such renunciation, and (b) they did not understand the effect

of such renunciation is therefore with the Defendants.

This issue was considered by the Court of Appeal in Mercantile Credit Ltd. v

Thilakaratne [(2002) 3 Sri LR 206] where it was held as follows:

It was also the contention of the plaintiff-appellant that the learned District

Judge had also erred in concluding that the clause relating to the renunciation of

the benefits to which guarantors are entitled to by law, which is known by the

term beneficium sui divisionis excussionis, has not been explained to the

guarantors. [page 208]

The burden of proving that the clauses relating to the renouncing of all benefits

and privileges to which sureties are entitled to by law were not understood by

him is a special fact within the knowledge of the person alleging it and by virtue

of section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance the burden of proving that fact is with

the person who asserts that fact. In this case since it was the position of the 2nd

defendant-respondent that the conditions of the agreement relating to

renunciation of the rights and the benefits of the guarantors were not understood

by him, the burden of proof of that fact lies with the 2nd defendant-respondent

who alleges it. [page 209]

Despite his admission in evidence that he was a businessman in whose names

the businesses are registered and he is a payee of income tax, he took up the

position in cross-examination that he was not aware of the nature of the contract

to which he entered into. He is a person who has taken loan facilities offering

guarantors as security. Therefore, his evidence that he did not understand or did

not care to see what he was required to sign and that he did not know the

meaning of the word guarantor in its colloquial sense makes his testimony

unacceptable. [page 211]

31

I am satisfied that the Defendants had the required knowledge that they were

renouncing the defence available to sureties that the Principal Debtor be proceeded

with in the first instance, and that the Defendants have failed to establish otherwise. I

say this for the following four reasons:

(a) The provisions of Clauses 18 and 19 are in clear and unambiguous language;

(b) It is admitted that the Defendants did not respond to the letters of demand P14

and P15 sent to them by the Plaintiff in May 2005. The Defendants being the

Chairman and a Director of the Principal Debtor, respectively, would have been

fully aware of the action that the Plaintiff had or had not taken against the

Principal Debtor. If it was their position that the said defence was available to

them or that the waiver of such defence was not explained to them or that they

had no knowledge in that regard, the Defendants should have taken it up at the

first available opportunity, which the Defendants failed to do;

(c) The answer filed on their behalf has no mention of this fact, although the

Guarantee P11 formed part and parcel of the plaint;

(d) The Defendants did not raise an issue in this regard.

It is only in the affidavit filed before the Commercial High Court that the 2nd Defendant,

for the first time, stated that although his signature and that of the 1st Defendant were

obtained on P11 and the related documents, the Plaintiff failed to explain the contents

of those documents to them. This explanation cannot be accepted since the need for

a guarantee was stated in the offer letter P5, which the Defendants had acknowledged

and signed, as well as in the loan agreements P6 and P7, which too has been signed by

the Defendants. Furthermore, the 2nd Defendant had admitted in cross examination

that P11 is a personal undertaking to pay the monies due to the Plaintiff [vide evidence

of 21st September 2007], which clearly demonstrates that he had knowledge of what

P11 entailed.

Having considered the evidence of the 2nd Defendant, the High Court has arrived at

the following conclusion, with which I agree:

I am therefore of the view that, (a) the burden of proving that they did not understand

or did not know that they were renouncing the defence of beneficium ordinis seu

excussionis or were not made aware of such fact is with the Defendants, and (b) the

Defendants have failed to discharge the said burden. The second basis for the second

question of law too must therefore fail.

P11 implied or tacit renunciation

The final issue to be considered is whether a renunciation can be implied from the

terms of P11, or whether there has been a tacit renunciation of the defence as a result

of the Defendants having undertaken liability not only as sureties but as co-principal

debtors, as well. This issue relates to both questions of law that I have referred to at

the beginning.

There are two clauses in P11 which points towards this position.

The first is Clause 18 itself where the Defendants have agreed that, each of us are

liable in all respects hereunder not merely as surety or sureties or guarantor or

guarantors but as sole or principal debtor or where this guarantee is signed or

executed by more than one person as sole or principal debtors jointly and severally, to

the extent aforementioned. .

The second is Clause 19 where the Defendants have agreed to be bound, separately

as sole or principal debtor or debtors in respect thereof.

Thus, the Defendants are not only sureties in terms of P11 but are co-principal debtors.

In Millman and another v Masterbond Participation Bond Trust Managers (Pty)

Limited (under curatorship) and others [supra], in tracing how the concept of co-

principal debtor came about, reference was made to Van der lyver v De Wayer and

Others (1861-1863) 4 Searle 27 at 29 where it was observed that, We find ... in the

Roman law no distinct explanation of the import of the words co-principal debtor,

but must seek this explanation in the practice of the Dutch Courts.

Reference has thereafter been made to Voet (46.1.16) which states that, ' ... (T)here is

no reason why sureties should not by a tacit renunciation lose the beneficium ordinis.

This is especially so if a man has bound himself for the debt as principal. For since it is

clear law that a principal debtor, as such, has not the advantage of the benefit of order,

it follows that either the sincere and specific statement of the surety, whereby he binds

himself as principal, must be null and void, or else, if it be of effect, such a surety should

not be allowed to avail himself of the benefit of order, that words which bear a specific

meaning may not in an agreement be idle and of no effect.'

Simon van Leeuwen discusses the point in Censura Forensis 1.4.17 .23 as follows:

'(A) surety bound as principal debtor is understood to have undertaken the

payment of the debt as his own, and is exactly in the same position as if he had

renounced all the benefits, and is sued, not as surety, but as principal debtor,

without any excussion of any other person. Because in contracts words are not

understood to be meaningless.'

(Watermeyer J's translation in Van der Iyver's case supra at 31.)

The position of a person who has undertaken the liabilities of a surety and co-principal

debtor was discussed in Union Government v Van der Merwe [1921 TPD 318 at 322],

where Wessels JP pointed out that:

'We must give some meaning to the words "co-principal debtor". That the

addition of these words operate(s) as a renunciation of the benefits of the surety

is clear, but they have a still greater force. The addition of these words shows that

the surety intends that his obligation shall be co-equal in extent with that of the

principal debtor: or otherwise expressed, that his obligation shall be of the same

scope and nature as that of the principal debtor.'

34

In Business Buying & Investment Co Ltd v Linaae [1959 (3) SA 93 (T) at 95H-96A],

Boshoff, J stated that, A person who signs as surety and co-principal debtor is both a

surety and debtor. As far as the creditor is concerned he is a co-debtor; his obligation

is co-equal in extent with that of the principal debtor and is thus of the same scope and

nature as that of the principal debtor.

Closer to home, in Wijeyewardene v Jayawardene [supra], both Chief Justice Wood

Renton and Justice De Sampayo acknowledged that the surety being liable as a co-

principal debtor amounts to a renunciation of the defence of beneficium ordinis seu

excussionis. A similar view was expressed in Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation v

Peoples Bank [supra], where Chitrasiri, J stated that, if the Surety has renounced

this right either expressly, by agreeing to a specific renunciation of this right or

impliedly, by accepting liability as a Principal Debtor and agreeing to be sued without

the Debtor excussing the Principal Debtor, the Surety cannot claim this right or insist

that, the Creditor must proceed against the Principal Debtor before proceeding against

the Surety. [emphasis added]

In Caneys The Law of Suretyship [supra; page 128], the author points out that, A

surety who has not the benefit of excussion is in the same situation as an ordinary

debtor, indeed as the principal debtor; a fortiori this is the case where a surety has

assumed liability as surety and co-principal debtor. He may be sued as soon as the

principal debtor is in default.

This position has been confirmed by Wessels [supra; page 1020] as follows:

A person who binds himself as surety and co-principal debtor is both surety and

debtor. As far as the creditor is concerned, he is a co-debtor; as far as the debtor

and co-sureties are concerned, he is a surety. He differs from the principal debtor

in that he has a right of recourse against him.

Hence a renunciation of the benefit of excussion is always implied when a surety

binds himself as surety and co-principal debtor or as surety and co-debtor.

35

I am therefore of the view that by undertaking liability as co-principal debtor, the

Defendants have impliedly as well as tacitly renounced their right to plead the defence

of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis. Having done so, the Defendants cannot now

claim that the Plaintiff must proceed against the Principal Debtor in the first instance

or that they have not renounced the defence of beneficium ordinis seu excussionis or

that Clause 18 is not valid or enforceable in terms of the law.

Conclusion

For the reasons set out above, I see no merit in the two questions of law raised by the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Defendants. The judgment of the Commercial High

Court is accordingly affirmed and this appeal is dismissed. The Plaintiff shall be entitled

to costs, both before this Court and the Commercial High Court.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT Murdu N.B. Fernando, PC, CJ I agree.

CHIEF JUSTICE Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J I agree.
