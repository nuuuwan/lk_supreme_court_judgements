Whether the property of the principal debtor has been sufficiently excussed is a"
"question of fact, on the determination of which the court may overrule the plea"
"taken by the surety…"
"T
he remaining question is whether the privileges allowed by law to sureties have"
"been  sufficiently  renounced  by  the  defendant.  It  will  be  noticed  that  none  of"
"them  are  specified 
in  the  surety  bond,  and  that  there 
is  only  a  general"
"renunciation,  as  the  fourth  clause  puts  it,  of  ""all  suretyship  and  other  rights."""
"There appears to be some difference of opinion among Roman-Dutch jurists as to"
"the effect of a general renunciation. The general principle appears to be that,"
"when a surety makes a renunciation, he must do so deliberately and with full"
"knowledge  of  his  rights,  and  so  Voet (46.1.16),  Van  Leeuwen's  Commentaries"
"(4.4.12), and other jurists lay down an inflexible rule that the privileges must be"
"renounced  specifically  and  by  name.  Kotze's  Note  to  Van  Leeuwen,  of  his"
"translation,  Nathan's  Common Law  of  South  Africa  and  Maasdorp's  Institutes,"
"(Vol. 
Ill,,  p.  364),  show  that 
in  South  Africa  this  rule  has  been  adopted  as"
"expressing  the  weightier  opinion  among  jurists.  On  the  other  hand,  Burge  on"
"Suretyship citing Herengius de Fidej says that the better opinion is that, where"
"the  renunciation  is  expressed  to  be  of  all  privileges  competent  to  sureties  as"
"distinguished from privileges simpliciter, the privilege of excussion and the other"
"privileges of sureties are sufficiently renounced. But I am not aware of any local"
"decision or established practice contrary to the rule laid down by the authorities"
"above referred to, and I think that we should follow the law accepted in modern"
"times  by  so  many  eminent  Roman-Dutch  lawyers  and  commentators.  Van  der"
"Keessel's Thesis, to which also Burge refers, does not seem to me to go so far as"
"Burge  himself,  ….""  Van  der  Keessel  appears  to  me  to  allow  the  validity  of  a"
"general renunciation, provided that the surety who makes it is himself a lawyer,"
"or declares that he has full knowledge of the rights he is so renouncing. Van der"
"Keessel undoubtedly is one of the greatest exponents of the Roman-Dutch law,"
"and his opinion is of special value to us, as his Theses were published at the very"
"time when Ceylon passed into British hands. But, in order to give effect to his view,"
"the condition on which he insists should at least be fulfilled. The defendant in this"
