"De Groot deals with the matter in a passage in his Inleiding tot de Hollandsche"
"Rechtsgeleertheyt 3.3 27-29, which reads as follows (Lee's translation at 319):"
"'27. By a law of the Emperor Justinian a surety acquired the right to keep the"
"creditor at arm's length until he had excussed the principal debtor; provided"
"that,  in  case  the  principal  debtor  is  outside  the  jurisdiction,  the  surety  shall"
"have a reasonable time appointed him to bring the principal debtor before the"
"Court; and in case after excussing the principal debtor the creditor's claim is"
"not entirely satisfied he may then have recourse against the surety."
