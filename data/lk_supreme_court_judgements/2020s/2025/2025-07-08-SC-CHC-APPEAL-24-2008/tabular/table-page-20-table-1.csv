"Censura  Forensis  Van  Leeuwen  deals  with  the  matter  thus:  ""But  ought  these"
"renunciations to be made expressly and specifically? Although some think that"
"they are sufficiently renounced by a general clause, including all the privileges, or"
"the  individual  privileges,  which  accrue  to  sureties,  and  can  accrue  to  them;  in"
"practice, nevertheless, it has been accepted that a general renunciation of all"
"privileges is not sufficient, but that they must be expressly and specifically given"
"up, since they are of the nature and substance of the act itself; and inasmuch as"
"general clauses of renunciation of this kind are generally, according to the custom"
"of  unskilled  notaries,  inserted  where  they  do  not  belong  in  their  documents,"
"without the knowledge of, and notice to, the parties."
