"meaning may not in an agreement be idle and of no effect.'"
"imon van Leeuwen discusses the point in Censura Forensis 1.4.17 .23 as follows:"
"'(A)  surety  bound  as  principal  debtor  is  understood  to  have  undertaken  the"
"payment of the debt as his own, and is exactly in the same position as if he had"
"renounced  all  the  benefits,  and  is  sued,  not  as  surety,  but  as  principal debtor,"
"without any excussion of any other person. Because in contracts words are not"
"understood to be meaningless.'"
"(Watermeyer J's translation in Van der Iyver's case supra at 31.)"
