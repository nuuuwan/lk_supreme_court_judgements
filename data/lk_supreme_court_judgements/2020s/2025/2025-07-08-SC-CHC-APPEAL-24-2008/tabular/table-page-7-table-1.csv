"Contracts of suretyship fall into two main categories: contracts of guarantee and"
"contracts  of 
indemnity.  Guarantees  and 
indemnities  have  many 
similar"
"characteristics,  and 
similar 
rights  and  duties  arise  between 
the  parties."
"Consequently,  it  is  not  unusual  to  find  the  term  ‘guarantee’  used  loosely  to"
"describe a contract which is in reality an indemnity (and vice versa)”."
