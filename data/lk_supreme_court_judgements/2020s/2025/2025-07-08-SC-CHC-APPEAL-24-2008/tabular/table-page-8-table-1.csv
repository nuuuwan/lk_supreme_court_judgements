"","similar  view  has  been  expressed  in  Vossloh  AG  v  Alpha  Trains  (UK)  Ltd  [supra;"
"paragraph 20] in the following manner:",""
"","“Contracts of suretyship … are an area of law bedevilled by imprecise terminology"
"","and where therefore it is important not to confuse the label given by the parties"
"","to  the  surety’s  obligation  (although  the  label  may  be  indicative  of  what  the"
"","parties intend) with the substance of that obligation. Because the parties are free"
"to  make  any  agreement  they","like,  each  case  must  depend  upon  the  true"
"","construction of the actual words in which the surety’s obligation is expressed. This"
"","involves ‘construing the instrument in its factual and contractual context having"
"","regard to its commercial purpose’, a task which the court approaches ‘by looking"
"at it as a whole without any preconception as to what it is.’”",""
