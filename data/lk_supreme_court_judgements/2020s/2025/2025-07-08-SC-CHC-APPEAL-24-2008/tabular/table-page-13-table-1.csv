". Balasingham in Institutes of the Laws of Ceylon [supra; pages 262-263] has stated"
"as follows:"
"â€œThe beneficium ordinis seu excussionis whereby a surety may throw the creditor,"
"when  he  demands  payment,  first  upon  the  goods  of  the  principal  debtor.  This"
"privilege,  however  is in  general  expressly  renounced  by  the  surety  in  the  deed"
"itself, and it is also held to be tacitly renounced when he constitutes himself surety"
"as principal."
