"further situation, which probably can be described as an implied renunciation, has"
"been cited by Wessels’ [supra; page 1019] as follows:"
"“The benefit may, however, be renounced tacitly, but this tacit renunciation must"
"not be confused with a general renunciation. If the circumstances show that the"
"surety must have intended to renounce this particular benefit, it is as effective"
"a renunciation as if he had done so in express terms (Voet, 46.1.16). If, therefore,"
"it  appears  from  the  suretyship  bond  that  its  very  object  was  that  the  creditor"
"should have recourse to the surety the moment the debtor made the default, then"
"the Court will infer a tacit renunciation of the benefit.” [emphasis added]"
