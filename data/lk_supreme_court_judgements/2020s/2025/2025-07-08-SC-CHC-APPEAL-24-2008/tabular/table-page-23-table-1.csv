"case is not a lawyer, nor has he made any declaration that he knew the privileges"
"which he waived. It was said at the argument that he must be presumed to have"
"known them, inasmuch as the notary who drew up and attested the bond must"
"be  taken  to  have  explained  these  things.  This,  even  if  it  happened,  would  not"
"satisfy  the  condition  which  seems  to  require  that  the  surety  should  actually"
"understand the matter and make a declaration to that effect. … I do not think"
"that the plaintiff is able to rely upon the authority of Van der Keessel.” [pages"
