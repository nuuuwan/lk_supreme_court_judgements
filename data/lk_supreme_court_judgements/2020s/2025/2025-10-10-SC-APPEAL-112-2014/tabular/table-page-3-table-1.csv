"(b) In any event, was the notice to quit valid in the circumstances of the"
"case?"
"The first question suggests that the defendants denied the plaintiff’s title."
"Even assuming that the defendants denied the plaintiff’s title, they did not"
"deny that they were tenants under the plaintiff. For the continuance of a"
"landlord–tenant  relationship,  it  is  not  necessary  that  the  landlord  be  the"
"owner of the premises. A valid tenancy agreement may come into existence"
"even between a trespasser and another, though such an agreement would"
"not bind the true owner."
"There  had  also  been  a  previous  litigation  (Case  No.  3510/L)  between  the"
"predecessors  of  the  present  parties.  The  plaintiff  contends  that  in  that"
"action the defendants claimed ownership of the premises, which was not"
"accepted  by  Court,  and  that  the  plaintiff’s  ownership  was  upheld.  The"
"plaintiff now argues that the defendants cannot approbate and reprobate"
"by asserting ownership in the earlier case and tenancy in the present action."
"If that was indeed the plaintiff’s position, the proper course would have been"
"to seek ejectment of the defendants in the earlier action itself. In this regard,"
"section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code becomes relevant."
