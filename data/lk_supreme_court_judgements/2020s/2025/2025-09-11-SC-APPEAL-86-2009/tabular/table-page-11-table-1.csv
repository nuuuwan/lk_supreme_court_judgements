"7.  The  Petitioner  states  that  the  Registrar  of  the  University,  by  letters  dated"
"04/09/2006,  communicated  the  decisions  of  the  Council:  namely,  that  the"
"Council  had  decided  to  refuse  her  request  to  be  re-employed  or  reinstated"
"(P12) and had accepted her resignation (P13)."
"8.  The  Petitioner  states  that, 
in  terms  of  Section  4.5  of  Chapter  V  of  the"
"Establishments  Code  of  the  University  Grants  Commission  and  the  Higher"
"Educational  Institutions/Institutes,  a  notice  of  resignation  tendered  under"
"Section  4.3  of  the  said  Chapter  “is  not  effective  until  it  is  approved  by  the"
"appropriate appointing authority.”"
"9.  In  the  circumstances,  it  is  submitted  that,  as  at  29/08/2006,  there  was  no"
"effective  resignation  for  the  1st  Respondent  University  and  its  Council  to"
"accept; therefore, the termination of the Petitioner’s services is unlawful."
"10. The Petitioner further states that her Letter of Resignation was not accepted"
"by 
the  Council  of 
the  University,  which 
is 
the  appropriate  appointing"
"authority,  until  29/08/2006;  therefore,  since  she  withdrew  her  Letter  of"
"Resignation  by  letter  dated  22/08/2006,  as  at  29/08/2006,  there  was  no"
"effective resignation for the Council to accept. Accordingly, the acceptance of"
"the 
Letter 
of  Resignation 
on 
29/08/2006 
is 
arbitrary, 
capricious,"
"unjustifiable, irrational, and therefore void ab initio, having no force or effect"
"in law."
"11. The Petitioner, inter alia, sought the grant of a writ of certiorari quashing the"
"decisions of the Council communicated to her by letters dated 04/09/2006"
"(P12  and  P13).  By  Judgment  dated  05/03/2009, 
the  Court  of  Appeal"
"dismissed the application of the Petitioner. The Petitioner is now before this"
"P a g e  11 | 17"
