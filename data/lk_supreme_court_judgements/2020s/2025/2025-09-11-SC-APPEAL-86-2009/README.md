Decided on: 11/09/2025

A. L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

1. This matter arises from an Appeal filed by the Petitioner seeking to set aside

the Judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 05/03/2009 and to obtain the

relief prayed for in the Petition dated 28/09/2006 filed in the Court of Appeal.

2. According to the Petition, the Petitioner was appointed as a Clerk Grade III at

the Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka with effect from 03/05/1999

(P1), and was subsequently confirmed in that said post by letter dated

26/01/2004 (P2). She was promoted to Clerk Grade II with effect from

03/05/2005 (P3). Her service record indicates transfers across various

divisions of the University, including the Finance Division, the

Administration Division at Homagama and Colombo, and thereafter the

Internal Examinations Division.

3. The Petitioner states that, as she was ill and in a state of depression, she

informed the 1st Respondent University of her illness on 25/07/2006 via

telegram, followed by a medical certificate dated 21/07/2006 (P16) with a

recommendation of one months medical leave. On 27/07/2006, the

P a g e 10 | 17

Petitioner tendered her Letter of Resignation dated 27/07/2006 (P7), stating

her intention to resign with effect from 24/07/2006. This was followed by the

Petitioners letter dated 10/08/2006 (P8) which is the acknowledgement of

the consequences of resignation.

4. The Petitioner contends that, subsequently, she recovered from her fragile

state of mind and, upon realizing the potential severity of her action and its

consequences, immediately submitted a letter dated 22/08/2006 (P9),

seeking to withdraw both her Letter of Resignation dated 27/07/2006 and her

letter of acknowledgment of the consequences of resignation dated

10/08/2006.

5. The Petitioner contends that upon receiving the Letter of Resignation, the

Petitioner was informed of the consequences of resignation by letter dated

03/08/2006 tendered to Court by the Respondents, marked as R5a, issued in

accordance with Section 4.6 of Chapter V of the Establishments Code of the

University Grants Commission and the Higher Educational

Institutions/Institutes. The Petitioner acknowledged receipt of this

communication by letter dated 10/08/2006 (P8).

6. The Petitioners Letter of Resignation was forwarded to the University Council

on 18/08/2006. Since the previous meeting of the Council had been held on

25/07/2006, both the Letter of Resignation and the letter seeking its

withdrawal were placed before the Council for consideration at its 258th

meeting held on 29/08/2006. The Council resolved to accept the resignation

and to reject the request for withdrawal, which was informed to the Petitioner

by letters dated 04/09/2006 (P12 and P13).

P a g e 11 | 17

7. The Petitioner states that the Registrar of the University, by letters dated

04/09/2006, communicated the decisions of the Council: namely, that the

Council had decided to refuse her request to be re-employed or reinstated

(P12) and had accepted her resignation (P13).

8. The Petitioner states that, in terms of Section 4.5 of Chapter V of the

Establishments Code of the University Grants Commission and the Higher

Educational Institutions/Institutes, a notice of resignation tendered under

Section 4.3 of the said Chapter is not effective until it is approved by the

appropriate appointing authority.

9. In the circumstances, it is submitted that, as at 29/08/2006, there was no

effective resignation for the 1st Respondent University and its Council to

accept; therefore, the termination of the Petitioners services is unlawful.

10. The Petitioner further states that her Letter of Resignation was not accepted

by the Council of the University, which is the appropriate appointing

authority, until 29/08/2006; therefore, since she withdrew her Letter of

Resignation by letter dated 22/08/2006, as at 29/08/2006, there was no

effective resignation for the Council to accept. Accordingly, the acceptance of

the Letter of Resignation on 29/08/2006 is arbitrary, capricious,

unjustifiable, irrational, and therefore void ab initio, having no force or effect

in law.

11. The Petitioner, inter alia, sought the grant of a writ of certiorari quashing the

decisions of the Council communicated to her by letters dated 04/09/2006

(P12 and P13). By Judgment dated 05/03/2009, the Court of Appeal

dismissed the application of the Petitioner. The Petitioner is now before this

P a g e 12 | 17

Court seeking to have the said Judgment set aside and to obtain the relief

prayed for in the Petition dated 16/04/2009 filed in this Court.

On 07/07/2009, the learned Counsel for the parties were heard in Support of

the said Petition. Upon consideration of the submissions made before this

Court, Special Leave to Appeal was granted on the following questions of law,

set out in paragraphs 18(e), (f), and (g) of the Petition;

(a) the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the Petitioner by applying

for re-employment is estopped from challenging the acceptance of the

resignation,

(b) the Court of Appeal erred in not considering and/or erred by the

improper application of the provisions of the UGC Establishments

Code,

(c) the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the Petitioner had resigned

from her post even though the Petitioner had moved to formally

withdraw her resignation prior to Council approval for such

resignation being granted;

LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ANALYSIS

12. In terms of Section 16(1) of the Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka Act,

No. 74 of 1981 (as amended), the University Council functions as the principal

executive and governing authority of the University. The Council consists of

the Vice Chancellor together with fourteen members appointed by the

President.

P a g e 13 | 17

13. Pursuant to Section 17(2)(xiii) of the Act, the Council is vested with the power

to appoint, suspend, terminate, or otherwise exercise disciplinary control over

employees of the University.

14. Accordingly, the resignation tendered by the Petitioner must be considered

within the statutory and regulatory framework governing the University. In

this regard, the Establishments Code of the University Grants Commission

and Higher Educational Institutions/Institutes provides that a resignation

becomes effective only upon approval by the appointing authority, and subject

to compliance with Sections 4.6 and 4.7 thereof.

15. Sections 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7 of Chapter V of the Establishments Code of The

University Grants Commission And The Higher Educational

Institutions/Institutes, reads as follows:

4.5. Notices of resignation given under subparagraphs 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3

above are not effective until they are accepted by the appropriate

appointing authority upon complying with the requirements of

subparagraphs 4.6 and 4.7 below.

4.6. On receipt of a letter of resignation, the person concerned should be

informed in writing of the consequences of his resignation: viz ;

(a) he will have no right to revert to his post thereafter ;

(b) he will forfeit all claims for any benefits arising from his service

in the Commission/Higher Educational Institution/ Institute, should

he afterwards succeed in obtaining employment in the Commission/

Higher Educational Institution/ Institute ;

P a g e 14 | 17

(c) if his resignation is accepted, any application to withdraw it later

will not be considered.

4.7. An acknowledgement to the effect that he has been informed of these

consequences of resignation be obtained from him and filed in his personal

file along with his notice of resignation.

16. Upon the Petitioners submission of the Letter of Resignation dated

27/07/2006, the University was required to ensure compliance with Section

4.6 of the Universities Establishments Code. In fulfilment of this requirement,

the Petitioner was formally notified in writing of the legal and administrative

consequences of her resignation through the document marked R5a. This

notification expressly set out the irreversible nature of the resignation once

accepted, including the forfeiture of any right to revert to her post and the

inability thereafter to withdraw the resignation.

17. Subsequently, in accordance with Section 4.7 of the Universities

Establishments Code, the Petitioner acknowledged in writing that she had

received and understood the implications of her resignation. This

acknowledgment, conveyed by her letter dated 10/08/2006 (P8), evidences

that the Petitioner was duly informed of, and accepted, the legal consequences

attendant on her decision to resign.

18. Even if the Petitioner initially failed to appreciate the gravity of her

resignation, the documentary record demonstrates that she was afforded

adequate notice of, and clarity regarding its irrevocability. The adherence to

the procedural safeguards contained in the Universities Establishments Code

ensured that the resignation was made knowingly and voluntarily.

P a g e 15 | 17

19. In terms of institutional procedure, Section 16(8) of the Buddhist and Pali

University of Sri Lanka Act requires that the University Council convene on

not fewer than ten occasions annually, in the following terms:

16. (8) The Council shall meet whenever necessary so however that

it meets on not less than ten occasions in a year.

20. The Council meeting for the month of July was held on 25/07/2006, and the

Petitioners resignation was received shortly thereafter. The resignation letter

was accordingly placed before the Council on 18/08/2006 (P10) for

deliberation at its next scheduled meeting on 29/08/2006.

21. Before the Council could consider the resignation, the Petitioner submitted a

further letter dated 22/08/2006 (P9), seeking to withdraw her resignation

and requesting re-employment. It is specifically noted that the said Letter of

Resignation was placed before the council on 18/08/2006 prior to the receipt

of the letter dated 22/08/2006, through which the Petitioner sought to

withdraw her resignation and requested re-employment. This request for

withdrawal and re-employment, together with her Letter of Resignation, was

duly placed before the Council at its 258th meeting held on 29/08/2006.

Having considered the documents and the relevant circumstances, the

Council resolved to accept the Petitioners resignation and to reject her

request for withdrawal and re-employment.

22. The Petitioner was formally notified of this decision by letters dated

04/09/2006 (P12 and P13), thereby concluding the administrative process in

accordance with the governing statute and the Universities Establishments

Code.

P a g e 16 | 17

23. The 1st Respondent thus acted in conformity with the applicable statutory and

regulatory provisions. The Petitioners resignation was processed with due

regard to institutional procedure, and her subsequent request for withdrawal

was duly considered and rejected by the competent authority.

24. Furthermore, the Petitioners application to the Court of Appeal in Case No.

1496/2006, seeking to quash the documents marked P12 and P13 by way of

a writ of certiorari, was dismissed on 05/03/2009. The Court found no

procedural impropriety or lack of jurisdiction in the issuance of the impugned

documents, thereby affirming the validity of the actions taken by the

University. The Petitioner failed to establish any legal basis on which to

impugn the vires of the said documents, and the dismissal of her application

further confirmed the procedural integrity of the decision-making process of

the University.

CONCLUSION

25. In all the above circumstances, this Court finds that the Buddhist and Pali

University acted in conformity with the statutory provisions of the governing

statute and the Establishments Code of the University Grants Commission

and the Higher Educational Institutions/Institutes. The Petitioners letter

dated 22/08/2006 (P9), seeking to withdraw her resignation and requesting

re-employment, was duly placed before the Council at its 258th meeting held

on 29/08/2006. Upon due consideration of all relevant material, the Council

resolved to accept the Petitioners resignation and to reject her request for

withdrawal and re-employment.

In all the above circumstances, I answer the questions of law (a), (b) and (c)

in the negative, and uphold and affirm the Judgment of the Court of Appeal

dated 05/03/2009.

P a g e 17 | 17

26. The Petitioner was duly informed of the consequences of her resignation,

which she had expressly acknowledged in writing. Accordingly, the Councils

decision to accept the resignation and reject the withdrawal request was both

lawful and procedurally sound.

27. For these reasons, the Appeal is dismissed. The Judgment of the Court of

Appeal dated 05/03/2009 is hereby affirmed. No order as to costs.
