"11. Upon the appeal made by the 2nd Petitioner, the application was"
"reconsidered on 16.10.2019 by the Interview Board consisting of"
"the  4th  to  6th  Respondents.  However,  the  said  respondents"
"rejected the appeal and proceeded to give zero marks to the 2nd"
"Petitioner  on  the  basis  that  the  registration  date  of  the  lease"
"bond  should  be  before  30.08.2019.  This  date  30th  August  2019"
"came into existence only in the amendment I have referred to in"
"paragraph  10  above.  It  is  in  evidence  that  the  lessor  of  the"
"Petitioners had extended the lease only from 20th March 2020 by"
"Lease Agreement bearing No 2009 and dated 08.10.2019. Since"
"the extension began from 20th March 2020, it was long after the"
"stipulated date in the amendment namely 30th August 2019 and"
"that  paved  the  way  for  the  rejection  of  the  appeal  under  the"
"amendment."
