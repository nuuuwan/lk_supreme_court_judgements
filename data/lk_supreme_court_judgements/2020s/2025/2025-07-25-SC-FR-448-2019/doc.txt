Respondents

Argued on: 06.07.2021

Decided on: 25.07.2025

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

1. This application has been instituted by the 2nd Petitioner, acting

on behalf of the 1st Petitioner, a minor, alleging an infringement

of their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of

the Constitution. The gravamen of the complaint concerns the

refusal to admit the 1st Petitioner to Grade 1 at Royal College,

Colombo 07, for the academic year 2020.

2. The Petitioners have maintained continuous possession of their

residential premises within the feeder area for over 15 years,

commencing in 2003, under successive lease agreements. These

lease agreements, first executed in 2009, were subsequently

renewed every three years. As of the date of the application, the

Petitioners permanent address was No. 125/2/1, Galle Road,

Colombo 4.

P a g e 5 | 11

3. The 2nd Petitioner, who is the father of the 1st Petitioner,

submitted the application under Clause 7.2 of Circular No.

20/2019 dated 24.05.2019, issued by the 2nd Respondent. The

application was made under the category children of residents

in close proximity to the school, which governs admissions to

Grade 1 in all government schools.

4. Under Clause 7.2, 50% of the total number of vacancies were

allocated to children falling within the "close proximity"

category. The clause also outlines the criteria for establishing

parental residence and the method for allocating marks based on

the supporting documents submitted by the applicant.

5. By virtue of Clause 7.2.1.1 of the circular, an applicant is entitled

to 10 marks if the property is leased or rented, provided that the

applicant can establish that the lease or rental agreements have

been continuously registered in the name of the applicant or the

applicants spouse for a period of five years or more.

6. In support of the application and to establish permanent

residence at the aforementioned address, the 2nd Petitioner

submitted several documents, including the lease agreements

referred to above, extracts from the Land Registry, extracts from

the electoral register for the years 2014 to 2018, a certificate of

residence issued by the Grama Niladhari, the marriage

certificate of the applicant and his spouse, birth certificates of his

other children, and various other supporting documents.

P a g e 6 | 11

7. It must be borne in mind that, at the time of submitting the

application, Lease No. 1878 was in force and valid for a period of

three years, commencing on 20th March 2017 and expiring on

19th March 2020.

8. The Petitioners aver that, pursuant to the submission of their

application, they were summoned by Royal College to appear for

an interview scheduled on 18.08.2019. At the said interview, the

Petitioners tendered the requisite documents in conformity with

the stipulations set out in the relevant circular. However, the

interview panel, comprising the 4th to 6th Respondents, declined

to evaluate the application or award any marks to the

Petitioners, on the ground that the lease agreement submitted

by them was not valid for a period extending one year beyond the

closing date of applications, as required by the said circular. They

were not allotted under clause 7.2.1.2 for additional documents

in proof of living.

9. The Petitioners preferred an appeal for reconsideration of the

decision to deny admission to Royal College.

10. Subsequently, Clause 7.2.1.1 of the circular was amended by the

2nd Respondent and it was notified by a letter dated 06.09.2019.

In terms of the amendment, the validity period set out in clauses

7.2.1.1 and 7.4.2 was amended. I will presently refer to it in the

course of the judgment.

P a g e 7 | 11

11. Upon the appeal made by the 2nd Petitioner, the application was

reconsidered on 16.10.2019 by the Interview Board consisting of

the 4th to 6th Respondents. However, the said respondents

rejected the appeal and proceeded to give zero marks to the 2nd

Petitioner on the basis that the registration date of the lease

bond should be before 30.08.2019. This date 30th August 2019

came into existence only in the amendment I have referred to in

paragraph 10 above. It is in evidence that the lessor of the

Petitioners had extended the lease only from 20th March 2020 by

Lease Agreement bearing No 2009 and dated 08.10.2019. Since

the extension began from 20th March 2020, it was long after the

stipulated date in the amendment namely 30th August 2019 and

that paved the way for the rejection of the appeal under the

amendment.

12. Thus it boils down that both under the circular and the

amendment brought about on 06.09.2019, the 1st Petitioner stood

disqualified for admission. I hasten to point out that it is not

clear as to how the date 30th August 2019 was so chosen as the

date before which lease agreements must be registered or

renewed. The reason as to why this date 30th August 2019 was

taken has not been forthcoming in the case and I would

specifically refer to the jurisprudence of Menura Nanwidu

Rambukkanage and Another v B.A.Abeyrathne and

another1 wherein Her Ladyship Justice Murdu Fernando (as

Her Ladyship the Chief Justice was then) alluded to the hurdles

1 SCFR 62/2018 dated 12.12.2018

P a g e 8 | 11

that a prospective applicant should necessarily overcome in order

to become eligible for admission of Grade 1 of a school.

13. This was a case where the application was made under the

Brother category. The question was that on refusing to give

marks in respect of a last will which is produced to establish

ownership to the residence, the interview panel, quite contrary

to the circular and other relevant letters considered in the case,

failed to allocate marks for the fact that the applicant already

had an elder brother as a student in the school and for his

performance, since he was in Grade 10 and was a junior prefect.

The judgment stated that the non-allocation of marks (although

the rejection of the last will since it was a contingent right - was

accepted) in respect of or the heads except the residence was

wrong. The school was directed to take the child in question

either to its grade 1 or an appropriate grade. At page 5 of the

judgment, Justice Murdu Fernando (as the Chief Justice then

was) stated that although the first respondent- the Principal of

Royal College moved for time before the Human Rights

Commission to consider the marks and documents pertaining to

brother category and residence category he did not tender them

to the Human Rights Commission until the Fundamental Rights

application was filed before the Supreme Court.

14. This court had not been told as to how an arbitrary date was

fixed so as to deny a particular category of applicants who had

registered their leases after 30th August 2019. Here was an

P a g e 9 | 11

applicant who had been living in close proximity to the school for

over 15 years and the Petitioners had in their possession

successive lease agreements.

15. In respect of this question, in the case decided by Her Ladyship

Justice Murdu Fernando, she made some pertinent observations

which I consider should merit a recall. She highlighted that

whether the school authorities took cognizance of the

classification made by the 12th Respondent (the Secretary to the

Ministry of Education) is a matter that should engage the

attention. A repeal of a provision of the circular does not ipso

facto mean that the application should be rejected in toto. In this

type of situations as we encounter in this case, the response of

the respondents had been that doing so would have led to an

overhaul of the entire evaluation process in respect of all

applicants whose applications had been rejected on the same

premise-see page 6 of the judgment. This is a seemingly harmless

way of saying that the wrong done to A cannot be redressed since

if it is done the same wrong committed in respect of B, C and D

also will have to be corrected. What principle of law, justice or

common sense would support such a proposition is a matter that

needs to be pondered, especially on the basis that this is a

question of the entitlement of the citizen for education.

16. Her Ladyship Murdu Fernando observed at page 13 of the

judgment-

P a g e 10 | 11

I cannot accept the reasons given by the respondents in not

reevaluating the applications in the best interests of the child as

contemplated by the letter of the Secretary, Ministry of

Education

Her ladyship was echoing the rights of the child which Sri Lanka

quite rigorously pursues in its obligations under the Convention

on the Rights of the Child (CRC).

17. Having given careful consideration to the circular and its

amendment, I take the view that if this date so arbitrarily chosen

does not stand in the way of this child, he would have the period

of 6 months that the amendment seeks to introduce. According

to the Petitioners they have maintained continuous possession of

the said premises within the feeder area for over 15 years, since

2003. In any event, the introduction of the date with would

amount to a breach of the procedural legitimate expectation that

any Petitioner would have before the policy is changed.

18. Though I do not seek to declare invalid the amended criteria, I

would hold that the arbitrary date that precludes the application

of this child being considered for admission to Royal College

should not be factored into the evaluation of the application of

the child for reasons I have adumbrated about such as the

disappointment of procedural legitimate expectation and other

criteria that the petitioner satisfies.

P a g e 11 | 11

19. In the circumstances, I determine that the denial of admission

of the child to grade 1 at Royal College is discriminatory and it

has caused an infringement of the fundamental rights of the

petitioners as guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution. Accordingly, I would order that the respondents

should take steps to admit the child to an appropriate grade to

Royal College. This determination is solely confined to the facts

immanent in this application of these Petitioners.
