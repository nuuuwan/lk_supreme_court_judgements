"Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of"
"2006."
"In consequence, in Aluthwatta’s case, the Court of Appeal directed that the"
"said application for revision and restitutio in integrum be transferred to the"
"relevant Provincial High Court for hearing and determination."
"Given that the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal is expressly vested with"
"appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees, and"
"orders of the District Court, Family Court, and Small Claims Court within"
"the  Province,  it  would  be  incongruous  in  practice  to  exclude  restitutio  in"
"integrum, as applications in revision and restitutio in integrum are commonly"
"pleaded together and operate in a complementary manner. I agree with the"
"observations made by Chithrasiri J. in Aluthwatta’s case that “all restitutio"
"in integrum applications also could be covered by a revision application even"
"though all revisions do not fall into the category of restitution.”"
"In this backdrop, I would strongly recommend that the legislature amend"
"section 5A(1) of Act No. 19 of 1990 so as to state the position expressly. For"
"clarity,  section  5A(1),  which  presently  reads  “shall  have  and  exercise"
"appellate and revisionary jurisdiction”, may usefully be amended to read:"
"“shall  have  and  exercise  appellate,  revisionary,  and  restitutio  in  integrum"
"jurisdiction”."
