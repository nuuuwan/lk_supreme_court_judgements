"inquiring into, pronouncing upon, or in any manner calling in question,"
"the validity of those provisions."
"The view of the Supreme Court in Swasthika Textile Industries Ltd case was"
"that, since Article 138(1) is not an entrenched provision, section 3 of the"
"High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, read"
"with  section  31D  of  the 
Industrial  Disputes  Act  as  amended  by 
the"
"Industrial  Disputes 
(Amendment)  Act  No.  32  of  1990, 
lawfully  vested"
"exclusive appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of orders made"
"by  Labour  Tribunals  in  the  Provincial  High  Court,  thereby  divesting  the"
"Court  of  Appeal  of  such  jurisdiction.  The  Supreme  Court  affirmed  that"
"Parliament,  by  ordinary  legislation,  may  reallocate  appellate  jurisdiction"
"from the Court of Appeal to the Provincial High Court, since Article 138(1)"
"is  not  entrenched  and  does  not  confer  an  immutable  jurisdiction.  It  was"
"further emphasised that such legislation did not amount to a constitutional"
"amendment  and  therefore  did  not  require  compliance  with  the  special"
"procedures prescribed in Articles 82 and 84 of the Constitution."
"By  way  of  further  illustration,  section  36A  of  the  Partition  Law  No.  21  of"
"1977, which originally provided that “any person dissatisfied with an order"
"made  by  the  court  under  section  36  may  prefer  an  application  for  leave  to"
"appeal to the Court of Appeal, with the leave of the Court of Appeal first had"
"and obtained”, was amended by the Partition (Amendment) Act No. 27 of"
"2024 to read that “any person dissatisfied with an order made by the court"
"under section 36 may prefer an application for leave to appeal to the relevant"
"High  Court  established  by  Article  154P  of  the  Constitution 
in  terms  of"
"subsection (2) of section 754 of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101) against"
"such order”. In line with the above dicta in Swasthika Textile Industries Ltd"
"case,  the  effect  of  this  amendment  is  to  divest  the  Court  of  Appeal  of"
"appellate jurisdiction in respect of such orders and to confer it exclusively"
"on the Provincial High Court."
