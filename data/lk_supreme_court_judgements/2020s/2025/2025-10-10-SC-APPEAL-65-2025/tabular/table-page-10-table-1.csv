"Article 138 of the Constitution.","",""
"The rationale is clear and straightforward. Article 138 of the Constitution is","",""
"not  an  entrenched  provision  but  only  an  enabling  provision.  As  Article","",""
"138(1)  expressly  states,  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  be","",""
"exercised “by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum” is “subject","",""
"to the provisions of the Constitution or of any law”. This makes it abundantly","",""
"clear that the scope and availability of such jurisdiction are dependent upon","",""
"specific constitutional or statutory authority. Article 138(2) reinforces this","",""
"position by stipulating that “The Court of Appeal shall also have and exercise","",""
"all such powers and jurisdiction, appellate and original, as Parliament may","",""
"by law vest or ordain.” Accordingly, Article 138 serves as the constitutional","",""
"foundation for conferring appellate, revisionary, and  restitutio in integrum","",""
"jurisdiction, but it does not, in and of itself, create an inherent or automatic","",""
"right of appeal. In the phrase “subject to the provisions of the Constitution or","",""
"of any law”, the term “any law” in this context must be understood in the","",""
"sense given by Article 170 of the Constitution, which defines “law” as “any","",""
"Act of Parliament and any law enacted by any legislature at any time prior","",""
"to the commencement of the Constitution and includes an Order in Council.”","",""
"Article  154P(6),  which  provides","that  “subject","to 
the  provisions  of

"Constitution and any law, any person aggrieved by a final order, judgment","",""
"or  sentence  of  any  such  Court","in  the  exercise  of","its 
jurisdiction  under"
"paragraphs (3)(b) or (3)(c) or (4), may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal","",""
"in accordance with Article 138”, must also be understood in the same tenor.","",""
"It commences with the phrase “subject to the provisions of the Constitution","",""
"and any law” and ends with “may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal in","",""
"accordance  with  Article  138”.  Like  Article  138,  Article  154P(6)  is  not  an","",""
