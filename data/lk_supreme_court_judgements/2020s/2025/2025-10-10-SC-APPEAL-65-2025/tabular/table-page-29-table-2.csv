"the words of Samarakoon C.J. in Ranasinghe v. Ceylon State Mortgage Bank"
"[1981] 1 Sri LR 121 at 127:"
"I  know  of  no  law  in  Sri  Lanka  which  states  that  the  expeditious"
"disposal of a case should guide a litigant in deciding the form in which"
"and  the  Court  in  which  his  action  should  be  filed.  Nor  does  the  law"
"state that such considerations should guide a court in deciding whether"
"it  is  to  entertain  an  action  or  not.  If  prudence  be  the  guide,  then  no"
"doubt such considerations will hold sway. The law does not however"
"lay down such a condition."
