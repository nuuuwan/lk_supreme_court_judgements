"28   
          SC/APPEAL/65/2025"
"As Sansoni C.J. stated in Cassim v. Government Agent, Batticaola (1966) 69"
"NLR 403 at 404 “There must be finality in litigation, even if incorrect orders"
"have to go unreversed.”"
"The aforementioned position cannot vary according to the mode by which"
"the Court of Appeal is approached. A party dissatisfied with a judgment of"
"the Provincial High Court cannot create a third tier of appellate scrutiny by"
"describing the route as revision or restitutio in integrum. In the impugned"
"order,  the  Court  of  Appeal,  following  Gunawardane  v.  Muthukumarana"
"[2020]  3  Sri  LR  306,  held  that  such  a  party  may  invoke  its  revisionary"
"jurisdiction on the basis that it is distinct from its appellate jurisdiction. I"
"am unable to agree with that view."
"Consider, for instance, a situation in which a Provincial High Court, in the"
"exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, enters judgment for the plaintiff. Two"
"defendants, independently contesting the case, thereafter pursue divergent"
"appellate remedies: one appeals to the Supreme Court with leave obtained,"
"whilst the other files a revision application before the Court of Appeal. If the"
"Supreme  Court  were  to  affirm the  judgment  of  the  Provincial  High  Court"
"while  the  Court  of  Appeal  were  simultaneously  to  set  it  aside,  the  result"
"would be an untenable jurisdictional conflict. Such a situation would not"
"only create inconsistency and uncertainty in the administration of justice,"
"but would also erode the hierarchical finality envisaged by the Constitution,"
"which recognises the Supreme Court as the apex judicial body."
"Recognition  of  such  a  practice  would  also  encourage  “judge  shopping”  or"
"“forum shopping” to secure a favourable forum, which a Five Judge Bench"
"of  this  Court 
in  JMC  Jayasekara  Management  Centre 
(Pvt)  Limited  v."
"[2024/25]  BLR  557  at  566 
Commissioner  General  of 
Inland  Revenue"
"emphatically declared “must be stopped at any cost”."
