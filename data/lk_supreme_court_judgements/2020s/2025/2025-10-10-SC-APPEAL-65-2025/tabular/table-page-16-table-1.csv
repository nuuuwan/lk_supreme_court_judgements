"By the Thirteenth Amendment, Parliament could have taken away (or"
"diminished)  even  an  entrenched  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,"
"because  a  constitutional  provision  can  be  amended  by  a 
later"
"constitutional amendment. But Parliament cannot, by a constitutional"
"amendment, give itself a blanket authorisation to affect an entrenched"
"jurisdiction  by  means  of  a  subsequent  ordinary  law.  For  example,"
"Parliament cannot confer an entrenched jurisdiction of this Court (e.g."
"under Articles 125 to 127) on High Courts, by an Act passed under and"
"in  terms  of  Article  154P(3).  However,  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  of"
"Appeal  under  Article  138  is  not  an  entrenched  jurisdiction,  because"
"Article  138  provides  that  it  is  subject  to the  provisions  “of  any  law”;"
"hence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to"
"be reduced or transferred by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled"
"to exercise judicial power). That is the reason why I held  in Swastika"
"Textile Industries Ltd. v. Dayaratne, that section 3 of the High Court of"
"the  Provinces 
(Special  Provisions)  Act,  No.  19  of  1990,  conferred"
"concurrent, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction on the High Courts in"
"respect  of  Labour  Tribunals,  and  that  thereafter  section  31D3  of  the"
"Industrial Disputes Act, as amended by Act No. 32 of 1990, made that"
"jurisdiction exclusive, thereby taking away the jurisdiction of the Court"
"of Appeal in that respect. And it was the absence of such a provision"
"that made Parliament unable to reduce or affect the jurisdiction of the"
"Court  of  Appeal  under  Article  140:  because  “its  jurisdictions  under"
"Articles 140 and 141 are entrenched; but for the proviso inserted by"
"the  First  Amendment,  its  jurisdiction  under  Article  140  cannot  be"
"transferred  even 
to 
the  Supreme  Court”

"&  4  of  1991  decided  on  07.02.1991). 
It  had  first  to  remove  the"
"entrenchment,  thereby  giving  Parliament  the  power,  by  subsequent"
