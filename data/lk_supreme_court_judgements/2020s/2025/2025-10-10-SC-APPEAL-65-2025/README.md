Introduction

Nearly ten years after the decree of divorce was entered, the plaintiff

instituted this action in the District Court of Negombo against the defendant

seeking partition of a land in equal shares on the basis that the parties were

legally divorced. The defendant moved for dismissal of the action on the

ground that the plaintiff was holding the half share of the land in trust for

the defendant. After trial, the District Court entered judgment in favour of

the plaintiff as prayed for. On appeal by the defendant, the Provincial High

Court of Civil Appeal of Negombo set aside the judgment of the District

Court and dismissed the plaintiff’s action.

Against the judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal of

Negombo, the plaintiff did not file a leave to appeal application in this Court

within six weeks (42 days) from the date of pronouncement of the judgment

(excluding the date of delivery of the judgment but including all Saturdays,

Sundays, public holidays, and the date of filing the application) as required

by Rule 7 read with Rule 28(1) of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 and section

5C of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of

1990, as amended by Act No. 54 of 2006. Vide Jinasena v. Hemamali [2011]

1 Sri LR 337 and Board of Investment of Sri Lanka v. Million Garments (Pvt)

Ltd [2014] 1 Sri LR 286. Instead, the plaintiff filed an application for

“revision or restitutio in integrum” in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution

in the Court of Appeal on the 44th day from the date of pronouncement of

the judgment.

3

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

In the Court of Appeal, the defendant raised a preliminary objection to the

maintainability of the said application on the ground that the Court of

Appeal has no jurisdiction to entertain, in any form—whether by way of

appeal, revision, or restitutio in integrum—a challenge to a judgment of the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal pronounced in the exercise of its

appellate jurisdiction, as such jurisdiction lies exclusively with the Supreme

Court. By order dated 15.11.2022, the Court of Appeal overruled this

objection and fixed a date for the defendant to file objections to the

substantive application. This appeal, preferred by the defendant with leave

obtained, is from that order of the Court of Appeal, and leave was granted

by this Court on the same question of law.

Establishment of Provincial High Courts

According to Article 105 of the Constitution, in the judicial hierarchy, after

the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal of

the Republic of Sri Lanka, the Constitution recognises the High Court of the

Republic of Sri Lanka.

Article 111(1) of the Constitution, as originally stood, read as follows:

The highest Court of First Instance exercising criminal jurisdiction and

created by law shall be called and known as “The High Court of the

Republic of Sri Lanka” and shall exercise such jurisdiction and powers

as Parliament may by law vest or ordain.

At that time, the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka exercised only

original criminal jurisdiction.

The 11th Amendment to the Constitution, certified on 6th May 1987,

repealed Article 111(1) and replaced it with a new sub-Article. After this

Amendment, Article 111(1) reads as follows:

4

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

There shall be a High Court of Sri Lanka, which shall exercise such

jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may by law vest or ordain.

This Amendment substituted the title “High Court of the Republic of Sri

Lanka” with “High Court of Sri Lanka” and eliminated the limitation to

criminal jurisdiction, thus allowing Parliament to determine its jurisdiction

without such restriction.

Article 154P of the Constitution, introduced by the 13ᵗʰ Amendment and

certified on 14ᵗʰ November 1987, provides for the establishment of a High

Court for each Province, commonly referred to as a Provincial High Court,

with jurisdiction to be exercised within the limits of the respective Province.

These Provincial High Courts were established as part of the scheme of

devolution of power under the 13ᵗʰ Amendment to the Constitution, with the

objective of decentralising certain judicial functions, enhancing access to

justice, and alleviating delays in the administration of justice. Prior to this

Amendment, all appeals from District Courts, Magistrates’ Courts, Labour

Tribunals, and similar fora throughout the country were heard by the Court

of Appeal, thereby substantially contributing to the persistent problem of

law’s delays at the appellate level. At that time, delays were more acute in

the Court of Appeal than in the original courts.

Article 154P of the Constitution reads as follows:

154P (1) There shall be a High Court for each Province with effect from

the date on which this Chapter comes into force. Each such High Court

shall be designated as the High Court of the relevant Province.

(2) The Chief Justice shall nominate from among Judges of the High

Court of Sri Lanka such number of Judges as may be necessary to each

such High Court. Every such Judge shall be transferable by the Chief

Justice.

5

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

(3) Every such High Court shall—

(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal jurisdiction of

the High Court of Sri Lanka in respect of offences committed

within the Province;

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any

law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province;

(c) exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament

may, by law, provide.

(4) Every such High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue, according to

law—

(a) orders in the nature of habeas corpus, in respect of persons

illegally detained within the Province; and

(b) order in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against any person

exercising, within the Province, any power under—

(i) any law; or

(ii) any statutes made by the Provincial Council

established for that Province, in respect of any matter set

out in the Provincial Council List.

(5) The Judicial Service Commission may delegate to such High Court,

the power to inspect and report on, the administration of any Court of

First Instance within the Province.

6

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

(6) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any

person aggrieved by a final order, judgment or sentence of any such

Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under paragraphs (3)(b) or (3)(c)

or (4), may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal in accordance with

Article 138.

It may be noted that although the 11ᵗʰ Amendment to the Constitution

amended Article 111(1) by substituting the term “High Court of Sri Lanka”

for “High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka”, it is clear that, for all practical

purposes, both expressions have been used interchangeably to refer to the

same judicial body, namely, the High Court of Sri Lanka.

After the 13th Amendment to the Constitution by which Provincial High

Courts were established, Article 111 was further amended by the 17th

Amendment to the Constitution, certified on 3rd October 2001. Article 111

now reads as follows:

111(1) There shall be a High Court of Sri Lanka, which shall exercise

such jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may by law vest or ordain.

(2) The Judges of the High Court shall—

(a) on the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission,

be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and

such recommendation shall be made after consultation with the

Attorney-General;

(b) be removable and be subject to the disciplinary control of the

President on the recommendation of the Judicial Service

Commission.

(3) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Article, Parliament

may by law provide for matters relating to the retirement of the Judge

of such High Court.

7

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

(4) Any Judge of the High Court may resign his office by writing under

his hand addressed to the President.

In terms of Article 111(2) of the Constitution, as introduced by the 17ᵗʰ

Amendment, the appointment, removal, and disciplinary control of Judges

of the High Court are vested in the President, based on the recommendation

of the Judicial Service Commission. In the case of appointments, such

recommendation must be made after consultation with the Attorney-

General. Judges are appointed by the President as Judges of the High Court

of Sri Lanka. The Constitution contains no separate provision for the

appointment of Judges specifically as Judges of the Provincial High Courts

established under Article 154P. All High Court Judges belong to a single

cadre, and may, in terms of the Constitution and relevant statutes, be

assigned to exercise jurisdiction. Article 111H(1)(a), introduced by the 17th

Amendment, provides that “The Judicial Service Commission is hereby

vested with the power to transfer Judges of the High Court.”

Article 154P(3) of the Constitution states:

Every Provincial High Court shall—

(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal jurisdiction of the

High Court of Sri Lanka in respect of offences committed within the

Province;

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law,

exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates

Courts and Primary Courts within the Province;

(c) exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may, by

law, provide.

8

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

It is by virtue of this enabling provision contained in Article 154P(3)(c) of the

Constitution that different types of Provincial High Courts, including the

Permanent High Court at Bar, have been established.

The first category of the High Court of the Provinces established under

Article 154P of the Constitution was constituted by the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990. This court primarily

exercises criminal jurisdiction and, in substance, corresponds to the

traditional High Court that existed prior to the establishment of the

Provincial High Courts, which exercised original criminal jurisdiction in

respect of grave offences. In addition, it is vested with appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments and orders of the

Magistrates’ Courts, Primary Courts, Labour Tribunals, and similar fora

within the Province.

By the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act

No. 54 of 2006, section 5 of Act No. 19 of 1990 was amended by the insertion

of subsections 5A to 5D, whereby appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of judgments and orders delivered by any District Court, Family

Court or Small Claims Court within such Province was conferred on the

Provincial High Court. This category of Provincial High Courts primarily

exercises civil appellate jurisdiction. They are known as High Courts of Civil

Appeal.

The High Courts of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 10 of 1996

introduced High Courts vested principally with original civil jurisdiction in

specific commercial matters, commonly referred to as Commercial High

Courts.

9

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal

In order to address the question of law on which leave to appeal was

granted, careful consideration of the scope of the jurisdiction of the Court

of Appeal is required.

Article 138 of the Constitution deals with the jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal.

138(1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction

for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed

by the High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction

or by any Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution and sole

and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in

integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things

of which such High Court, Court of First Instance, tribunal or other

institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which

has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice.

(2) The Court of Appeal shall also have and exercise all such powers

and jurisdiction, appellate and original, as Parliament may by law vest

or ordain.

As held by a Five Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Tennakoonwela v.

Director General, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption (SC/TAB/4/2023, SC Minutes of 07.10.2024 at page 20), a party

dissatisfied with any judgment or order of the Provincial High Court cannot,

10

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

as of right, invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under

Article 138 of the Constitution.

The rationale is clear and straightforward. Article 138 of the Constitution is

not an entrenched provision but only an enabling provision. As Article

138(1) expressly states, the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to be

exercised “by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum” is “subject

to the provisions of the Constitution or of any law”. This makes it abundantly

clear that the scope and availability of such jurisdiction are dependent upon

specific constitutional or statutory authority. Article 138(2) reinforces this

position by stipulating that “The Court of Appeal shall also have and exercise

all such powers and jurisdiction, appellate and original, as Parliament may

by law vest or ordain.” Accordingly, Article 138 serves as the constitutional

foundation for conferring appellate, revisionary, and restitutio in integrum

jurisdiction, but it does not, in and of itself, create an inherent or automatic

right of appeal. In the phrase “subject to the provisions of the Constitution or

of any law”, the term “any law” in this context must be understood in the

sense given by Article 170 of the Constitution, which defines “law” as “any

Act of Parliament and any law enacted by any legislature at any time prior

to the commencement of the Constitution and includes an Order in Council.”

Article 154P(6), which provides that “subject to the provisions of the

Constitution and any law, any person aggrieved by a final order, judgment

or sentence of any such Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under

paragraphs (3)(b) or (3)(c) or (4), may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal

in accordance with Article 138”, must also be understood in the same tenor.

It commences with the phrase “subject to the provisions of the Constitution

and any law” and ends with “may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal in

accordance with Article 138”. Like Article 138, Article 154P(6) is not an

entrenched provision, but is expressly conditioned to operate “subject to the

provisions of the Constitution and any law.”

11

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

It was held in the landmark case of Martin v. Wijewardena [1989] 2 Sri LR

409 that Article 138(1) only defines the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal

and does not create or confer new rights of appeal. Jameel J. (with the

concurrence of Ranasinghe C.J. and Amerasinghe J.) stated at 413:

Article 138 is an enabling provision which creates and grants

jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal to hear appeals from Courts of First

Instance, Tribunals and other Institutions. It defines and delineates the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. It does not, nor indeed does it seek

to, create or grant rights to individuals viz-a-viz appeals. It only deals

with the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal and its limits and its

limitations and nothing more. It does not expressly nor by implication

create or grant any rights in respect of individuals.

Martin v. Wijewardena has been consistently followed in later cases

including Gamhewa v. Maggie Nona [1989] 2 Sri LR 250, Gunaratne v.

Thambinayagam [1993] 2 Sri LR 355, Malegoda v. Joachim [1997] 1 Sri LR

88, Bandara v. People’s Bank [2002] 3 Sri LR 25, The People’s Bank v.

Camillus Perera [2003] 2 Sri LR 358, Wickramasekera v. Officer-in-Charge,

Police Station, Ampara [2004] 1 Sri LR 257, Jayawardena v. Sampath Bank

[2005] 2 Sri LR 83, Bakmeewewa, Authorised Officer of People’s Bank v.

Konarage Raja [1989] 1 Sri LR 231, Hatton National Bank v. Thejasiri

Gunethilake [2016] 1 Sri LR 276, DFCC Bank v. Rajitha Fernando [2024/25]

BLR 106.

In Swasthika Textile Industries Ltd v. Thantrige Dayaratne [1993] 2 Sri LR

348, the question before the Supreme Court was whether section 3 of the

High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, read

with Article 154P of the Constitution, empowered a Provincial High Court

to hear and determine appeals from orders of Labour Tribunals,

notwithstanding the provisions of Article 138 of the Constitution. The

respondent contended that appellate jurisdiction in respect of Labour

12

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

Tribunals was vested in the Court of Appeal under Article 138(1), and that

Article 154P(3)(c) did not authorise Parliament to divest a jurisdiction

constitutionally vested in the Court of Appeal and to confer it upon the

Provincial High Court, save by way of a constitutional amendment or an Act

passed with a special majority as stipulated in Articles 82 and 84.

Mark Fernando J. (with the agreement of Bandaranayake J. and Kulatunga

J.), making reference to the Supreme Court Determination on the Agrarian

Services (Amendment) Bill, stated at 352-353:

Apart from jurisdictions constitutionally vested and entrenched,

directly or indirectly, Parliament may, by ordinary legislation, abolish,

alter or transfer jurisdictions; Parliament may create a new jurisdiction

or transfer an existing jurisdiction, so long as such jurisdiction is vested

in a person or body constitutionally entitled to exercise the judicial

power of the people;

The appellate and revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under

Article 138(1) is not entrenched, as it is “subject to the provisions of the

Constitution or of any law”; it may therefore be abolished, amended or

transferred. By contrast, its jurisdictions under Articles 140 and 141

are entrenched; but for the proviso inserted by the First Amendment,

its jurisdiction under Article 140 cannot be transferred even to the

Supreme Court;

The jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 111, originally and after

the Thirteenth Amendment, was neither defined nor entrenched and

had to be conferred by Parliament, by ordinary law. Article 154P(3)(b)

conferred jurisdiction on the High Court “notwithstanding anything in

Article 138”, thus avoiding any possibility of an argument that these

provisions were contradictory, and manifesting an intention to confer a

concurrent jurisdiction. That jurisdiction was also “subject to any law”,

13

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

and therefore (as in the case of Article 138) was not entrenched, and

was liable to alteration by Parliament by ordinary law.

Article 111(1) and 138 enabled Parliament by ordinary law, to transfer

an existing jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 138, to the

High Court. Accordingly, there is no justification for adopting a

restrictive interpretation of Article 154P(3)(c), inconsistent with those

provisions—as, for instance, by requiring a law passed by a special

majority; its plain meaning and effect is to empower Parliament to

confer any “other” jurisdiction on the High Court, i.e. in addition to the

“original criminal jurisdiction”, and the “appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of convictions, (etc.) by Magistrates Courts and

Primary Courts”, “appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

orders made by Labour Tribunals” is “other” jurisdiction.

It is therefore beyond argument that section 3 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, read with Articles

111, 138 and 154P(3)(c), conferred concurrent appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction on the High Court in respect of orders of Labour

Tribunals; and section 31D(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act, as

amended by Act No. 32 of 1990, made that jurisdiction exclusive

(thereby taking away the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in that

respect). Those provisions were enacted in the exercise of the powers

conferred by the Constitution, and were not in any way an amendment

of the Constitution, and the question of compliance with Article 82 did

not arise; nor were they inconsistent with the Constitution, and the

question of compliance with Article 84 did not arise. There being no

inconsistency between the provisions of those amending Acts, and the

Constitution, those provisions cannot, by any process of interpretation,

be treated as inoperative or ineffective. Insofar as the validity of those

provisions is concerned, Article 80(3) precludes this Court from

14

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

inquiring into, pronouncing upon, or in any manner calling in question,

the validity of those provisions.

The view of the Supreme Court in Swasthika Textile Industries Ltd case was

that, since Article 138(1) is not an entrenched provision, section 3 of the

High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, read

with section 31D of the Industrial Disputes Act as amended by the

Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act No. 32 of 1990, lawfully vested

exclusive appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of orders made

by Labour Tribunals in the Provincial High Court, thereby divesting the

Court of Appeal of such jurisdiction. The Supreme Court affirmed that

Parliament, by ordinary legislation, may reallocate appellate jurisdiction

from the Court of Appeal to the Provincial High Court, since Article 138(1)

is not entrenched and does not confer an immutable jurisdiction. It was

further emphasised that such legislation did not amount to a constitutional

amendment and therefore did not require compliance with the special

procedures prescribed in Articles 82 and 84 of the Constitution.

By way of further illustration, section 36A of the Partition Law No. 21 of

1977, which originally provided that “any person dissatisfied with an order

made by the court under section 36 may prefer an application for leave to

appeal to the Court of Appeal, with the leave of the Court of Appeal first had

and obtained”, was amended by the Partition (Amendment) Act No. 27 of

2024 to read that “any person dissatisfied with an order made by the court

under section 36 may prefer an application for leave to appeal to the relevant

High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution in terms of

subsection (2) of section 754 of the Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101) against

such order”. In line with the above dicta in Swasthika Textile Industries Ltd

case, the effect of this amendment is to divest the Court of Appeal of

appellate jurisdiction in respect of such orders and to confer it exclusively

on the Provincial High Court.

15

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

In Sriyawathie v. Superintendent Hapugastenne Estate and Others [1997] 1

Sri LR 1 at 5, Kulatunga J. (with the agreement of G.P.S. De Silva C.J. and

Amarasinghe J.) stated:

I cannot accept the submission that the decision in Swastika Textile

Industries Ltd. case (supra) is per incuriam. The ratio in Martin v.

Wijewardena (supra) cited by the appellant’s Counsel in support of his

argument is that a right of appeal is a statutory right and must be

expressly created and granted by Statute; and that Article 138 is only

an enabling article which confers the jurisdiction to hear and determine

appeals to the Court of Appeal. The right to avail of or take advantage

of that jurisdiction is governed by the several statutory provisions in

various legislative enactments.

In Weragama v. Eksath Lanka Wathu Kamkaru Samithiya and Others [1994]

1 Sri LR 293, the issue concerned the writ jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court under Article 154P(4) of the Constitution. In that case, a writ

application was filed in a Provincial High Court seeking writs of certiorari

and mandamus against the President of a Labour Tribunal. The Supreme

Court held that Article 154P did not confer writ jurisdiction on the

Provincial High Courts in respect of Presidents of Labour Tribunals, nor had

Parliament by law conferred such jurisdiction on the Provincial High Courts

under Article 154P(3)(c). The Supreme Court further observed that where a

law or statute relates to a subject in the Provincial Council List, but not

otherwise, the exercise of powers thereunder is subject to the writ

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court. Presidents of Labour Tribunals did

not fall within the Provincial Council List.

Mark Fernando J. (with the agreement of Dheeraratne J. and

Wadugodapitiya J.) explained the law at pages 299–300 as follows:

16

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

By the Thirteenth Amendment, Parliament could have taken away (or

diminished) even an entrenched jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal,

because a constitutional provision can be amended by a later

constitutional amendment. But Parliament cannot, by a constitutional

amendment, give itself a blanket authorisation to affect an entrenched

jurisdiction by means of a subsequent ordinary law. For example,

Parliament cannot confer an entrenched jurisdiction of this Court (e.g.

under Articles 125 to 127) on High Courts, by an Act passed under and

in terms of Article 154P(3). However, the jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal under Article 138 is not an entrenched jurisdiction, because

Article 138 provides that it is subject to the provisions “of any law”;

hence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to

be reduced or transferred by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled

to exercise judicial power). That is the reason why I held in Swastika

Textile Industries Ltd. v. Dayaratne, that section 3 of the High Court of

the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990, conferred

concurrent, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction on the High Courts in

respect of Labour Tribunals, and that thereafter section 31D3 of the

Industrial Disputes Act, as amended by Act No. 32 of 1990, made that

jurisdiction exclusive, thereby taking away the jurisdiction of the Court

of Appeal in that respect. And it was the absence of such a provision

that made Parliament unable to reduce or affect the jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal under Article 140: because “its jurisdictions under

Articles 140 and 141 are entrenched; but for the proviso inserted by

the First Amendment, its jurisdiction under Article 140 cannot be

transferred even to the Supreme Court” (Determination in re the

Agrarian Services (Amendment) Bill – SC Special Determinations Nos 2

& 4 of 1991 decided on 07.02.1991). It had first to remove the

entrenchment, thereby giving Parliament the power, by subsequent

ordinary law, to transfer part of that jurisdiction to this Court. If a

constitutional amendment was necessary in order to transfer part of

17

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

an entrenched jurisdiction from the Court of Appeal to a higher Court,

it would be anomalous indeed if a transfer to an inferior court was

possible without such an amendment.

Subsequent cases such as Sunil Chandra Kumara v. Veloo [2001] 3 Sri LR

91, Wickramasekera v. Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Ampara [2004] 1 Sri

LR 257, Priyadharshani v. Ammasi Krishna (SC/APPEAL/62/2018, SC

Minutes of 24.03.2025) followed Weragama. I must note that even in

Gunawardane v. Muthukumarana [2020] 3 Sri LR 306 at 313, which I will

address separately, the Supreme Court endorsed the dicta expressed in

Weragama.

Purposive interpretation of constitutional provisions

In general, the principles governing the interpretation of a Constitution

differ from those applicable to ordinary statutes. Constitutional

interpretation must be broad, purposive, and dynamic, for a Constitution

is a living instrument, intended to endure and to guide the governance of

the people through changing circumstances. Its provisions must therefore

be construed in a manner that gives effect to their underlying purpose,

upholds the democratic spirit, and facilitates social progress, while

eschewing interpretations that would impede the effective functioning of the

institutions it establishes.

Samarakoon C.J. in Wadigamangawa and Others v. Wimalasuriya [1981] 1

Sri LR 287, observed at 293:

As was stated by Lord Wilberforce in Minister of Home Affairs v. Fisher

(1973) 3 All ER 21 at 26, a Constitution is a document sui generis

“calling for principles of interpretation of its own, suitable to its

character…, without necessary acceptance of all the presumptions that

are relevant to legislation of private law.”

18

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

N.S. Bindra, Interpretation of Statutes, 13th Edition (2023), page 656 states:

Constitutional provisions are required to be understood and interpreted

with an object-oriented approach. A constitution must not be construed

in a narrow and pedantic sense. The words used may be general in

terms but, their full import and true meaning, has to be appreciated

considering the true context in which the same are used and the

purpose which, they seek to achieve. A Constitution is not just a

document in solemn form, but a living framework for the government of

the people exhibiting a sufficient degree of cohesion and its successful

working depends upon the democratic sprit underlying it being

respected in letter and in sprit. Hence, the Supreme Court is not bound

to accept an interpretation which retards the progress or impedes social

integration.

The Indian Supreme Court in Ashok Tanwar v. State of HP and others (AIR

2005 SC 614), whilst stating that “the constitutional provisions cannot be cut

down by technical construction rather it has to be given liberal and

meaningful interpretation. The ordinary rules and presumptions, brought in

aid to interpret the statutes, cannot be made applicable while interpreting the

provisions of the Constitution” cited with approval the celebrated decision of

the US Supreme Court in McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 US (4 Wheat.) 316 at

407 (1819), in which Marshall C.J. emphasised that the interpretation of

the Constitution should be guided by its broad framework rather than

minute details:

A constitution, to contain an accurate detail of all the subdivisions of

which its great powers will admit, and of all the means by they may

be carried into execution, would partake of the prolixity of a legal code,

and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind. It would probably

never be understood by the public. Its nature, therefore, requires that

only its great outlines should be marked, its important objects

19

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

designated, and the minor ingredients which compose those objects be

deduced from the nature of the objects themselves… we must never

forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding.

In the same case, the Supreme Court of India also cited the following

passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Hunter v.

Southam Inc. (1984) 2 SCR 145 at 156, where the same sentiments were

echoed:

It is clear that the meaning of ‘unreasonable’ cannot be determined by

recourse to a dictionary, nor for that matter, by reference to the rules of

statutory construction. The task of expounding a constitution is

crucially different from that of construing a statute. A statute defines

present rights and obligations. It is easily enacted and as easily

repealed. A Constitution, by contrast, is drafted with an eye to the

future. Its function is to provide a continuing framework for the

legitimate exercise of governmental power and, when joined by a Bill

or a Charter of Rights, for the unremitting protection of individual rights

and liberties. Once enacted, its provisions cannot easily be repealed or

amended. It must, therefore, be capable of growth and development

over time to meet new social, political and historical realities often

unimagined by its framers. The judiciary is the guardian of the

Constitution and must, in interpreting its provisions, bear these

considerations in mind. Professor Paul Freund expressed this idea

aptly when he admonished the American Courts ‘not to read the

provisions of the Constitution like a last will and testament lest it

become one’.

Thus, across all major jurisdictions it is recognised that a Constitution must

be read as a living and organic instrument, to be construed broadly and

purposively so as to promote its objectives and values, rather than narrowly

as an ordinary statute.

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal over judgments of the Provincial

High Court exercising appellate jurisdiction

The Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to entertain appeals from judgments

and orders pronounced by Provincial High Courts in the exercise of their

appellate jurisdiction, as such jurisdiction vests exclusively in the Supreme

Court.

Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19

of 1990 defines the forum jurisdiction in relation to appeals under the Act.

9. Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law, any person

aggrieved by–

(a) a final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of the

appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P of

the Constitution or section 3 of this Act or any other law, in any matter

or proceeding whether civil or criminal which involves a substantial

question of law, may appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court if the High

Court grants leave to appeal to the Supreme Court ex mere motu or at

the instance of any aggrieved party to such matter or proceedings:

Provided that the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special

leave to appeal to the Supreme Court from any final or interlocutory

order, judgment, decree or sentence made by such High Court, in the

exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of

Article 154P of the Constitution or section 3 of this Act, or any other law

where such High Court has refused to grant leave to appeal to the

Supreme Court, or where in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the case

or matter is fit for review by the Supreme Court:

21

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

Provided further that the Supreme Court shall grant leave to appeal in

every matter or proceeding in which it is satisfied that the question to

be decided is of public or general importance; and

(b) a final order, judgment or sentence of a High Court established by

Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of its jurisdiction

conferred on it by paragraph (3) (a), or (4) of Article 154P of the

Constitution may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal.

Paragraphs (3)(a) and (4) of Article 154P of the Constitution set out the

instances in which a Provincial High Court exercises original jurisdiction,

as distinct from its appellate jurisdiction, within the Province.

Section 11 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.

19 of 1990, defines the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in

respect of judgments of the Provincial High Courts, thereby establishing the

statutory framework through which appeals from the Provincial High

Courts are directed to the Court of Appeal. Significantly, section 11(1)

provides that the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal shall be exercised

“subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law”, thereby underscoring

that Parliament, by ordinary legislation, may amend, restrict, or reallocate

that jurisdiction. This is consistent with the principle affirmed in several

cases including Swasthika Textile Industries Ltd, that appellate jurisdiction

under Article 138 is not entrenched and may be altered by ordinary law

without recourse to a constitutional amendment.

11(1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise, subject to the

provisions of this Act or any other law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by any

High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the

exercise of its jurisdiction under paragraph (3) (a), or (4) of Article 154P

of the Constitution and sole and exclusive cognizance by way of

22

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum of all causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things of which such High Court may have

taken cognizance:

Provided that, no judgment, decree or order of any such High Court,

shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect, or

irregularity which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the

parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

(2) The Court of Appeal may in the exercise of its jurisdiction, affirm,

reverse, correct or modify any order, judgment, decree or sentence

according to law or it may give directions to any High Court established

by Article 154P of the Constitution or order a new trial or further

hearing upon such terms as the Court of Appeal shall think fit.

(3) The Court of Appeal may further receive and admit new evidence

additional to, or supplementary of, the evidence already taken in any

High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution touching the

matters at issue in any original case, suit, prosecution or action, as the

justice of the case may require.

In sum, under section 9(a) of Act No. 19 of 1990, where the Provincial High

Court pronounces its final order, judgment, decree or sentence in the

exercise of its appellate jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P(3)(b) of the

Constitution, section 3 of Act No. 19 of 1990, or any other law, an appeal

lies to the Supreme Court and not to the Court of Appeal. Conversely, under

section 9(b) read with section 11(1) of Act No. 19 of 1990, where the

Provincial High Court pronounces its final order, judgment or sentence in

the exercise of its original jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P(3)(a), Article

154P(4) of the Constitution, or any other law, an appeal lies to the Court of

Appeal and not to the Supreme Court.

23

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

As I have already observed, Article 154P(6), which provides that “subject to

the provisions of the Constitution and any law, any person aggrieved by a

final order, judgment or sentence of any such Court in the exercise of its

jurisdiction under paragraphs (3)(b) or (3)(c) or (4), may appeal therefrom to

the Court of Appeal in accordance with Article 138”, must be construed in its

proper context. The provision begins with the phrase “subject to the

provisions of the Constitution and any law” and concludes with the words

“may appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal in accordance with Article 138.”

Both Articles 138 and 154P(6) are not entrenched provisions, and each is

expressly conditioned to operate subject to the Constitution and to any law

enacted by Parliament.

Appeal against judgments and orders of Provincial Criminal High Court

exercising revisionary jurisdiction

The Provincial High Court exercises not only original and appellate

jurisdiction but also revisionary jurisdiction, as provided in Article

154P(3)(b) of the Constitution. Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, stipulates that a party aggrieved by

a final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a Provincial High Court in the

exercise of its appellate jurisdiction may appeal to the Supreme Court with

leave obtained. By way of illustration, section 74(2) of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, expressly provides that no appeal lies against

an order made under section 66 of that Act. In such circumstances, an

aggrieved party may invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial

High Court to challenge such orders.

Since section 9 of Act No. 19 of 1990 states that appeals to the Supreme

Court lies against judgments and orders made by the Provincial High Court

“in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction”, in cases such as Gunaratne v.

Thambinayagam [1993] 2 Sri LR 355, Abeygunasekera v. Setunga [1997] 1

Sri LR 62, and Abeywardene v. Ajith De Silva [1998] 1 Sri LR 134, this Court

24

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

held that a party aggrieved by a judgment or order of a Provincial High Court

in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction, as opposed to its appellate

jurisdiction, cannot directly appeal to the Supreme Court, and such a party

must first invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, and only

thereafter, if unsuccessful, may appeal to the Supreme Court. In

Abeywardene v. Ajith De Silva, at page 137, the Supreme Court observed:

“if in consequence of these decisions there would be an undesirable increase

of litigation, that is the matter for the legislature.”

It is this anomaly that has contributed, for instance, to inordinate delays in

the conclusion of applications under section 66 of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act, notwithstanding that such applications are intended only to

result in a provisional order preserving the status quo until the substantive

issues are determined in a civil action.

The legislative intent in withholding a right of appeal against orders made

under section 66 was not to prolong litigation but to ensure its expeditious

disposal. Where no right of appeal is granted by law, it would be illogical to

permit two successive appeals to lie—first to the Court of Appeal and

thereafter to the Supreme Court—whereas in situations where an appeal is

expressly provided, only one appeal lies directly to the Supreme Court.

In this backdrop, I would strongly recommend that the legislature consider

amending sections 9 and 10 of Act No. 19 of 1990 by interpolating the words

“or revisionary” after the phrase “in the exercise of the appellate”, so that

the provision would read: “a party aggrieved by a judgment or order of the

High Court in the exercise of the appellate or revisionary jurisdiction may

appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court.”

25

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

Appellate and revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court

against judgments and orders of the District Court

By the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provinces) (Amendment) Act No.

54 of 2006, sections 5A, 5B and 5C were introduced to the Principal Act No.

19 of 1990. This was done to confer appellate and revisionary jurisdiction

to the Provincial High Courts against judgments and orders of the District

Courts of the relevant Provinces. These High Courts are commonly referred

to as High Courts of Civil Appeal.

In general, the procedure to be followed in the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal is the same as that followed in the Court of Appeal. Section 5A(2) of

Act No. 19 of 1990 provides that the provisions of sections 23 to 27 of the

Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978, sections 753 to 760 and sections 765 to 777

of the Civil Procedure Code, and any written law applicable to the exercise

of jurisdiction by the Court of Appeal, shall apply to the Provincial High

Court. Article 170 of the Constitution defines “written law” to mean “any

law and subordinate legislation and includes statutes made by a Provincial

Council, Orders, Proclamations, Rules, By-laws and Regulations made or

issued by any body or person having power or authority under any law to

make or issue the same.” It is in this context that the Rules of the Court of

Appeal and the Rules of the Supreme Court (insofar as they are applicable

to the Court of Appeal), made by the Chief Justice together with three

Judges of the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution, apply

with equal force to proceedings before the Provincial High Courts of Civil

Appeal.

After the said amendment by Act No. 54 of 2006, section 5A of the Principal

Act No.19 of 1990 reads as follows:

5A(1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for

a Province, shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary

26

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered and

made by any District Court, Family Court or Small Claims Court within

such Province and the appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all

errors in fact or in law, which shall be committed by any such of a

District Court, of a Family Court or of a Small Claims Court as the case

may be.

(2) The provisions of sections 23 to 27 of the Judicature Act, No. 2 of

1978 and sections 753 to 760 and sections 765 to 777 of the Civil

Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any written law applicable to the

exercise of the jurisdiction referred to in subsection (1) by the Court of

Appeal, shall be read and construed as including a reference to a High

Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a Province and

any person aggrieved by any judgment, decree or order of a District

Court or a Family Court or of a Small Claims Court, as the case may

be, within a Province, may invoke the jurisdiction referred to in that

subsection, in the High Court established for that Province:

Provided that no judgment or decree of a District Court or of a Family

Court, as the case may be, shall be reversed or varied by the High

Court on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure

of justice.

Appeals against judgments and orders of the Provincial High Court of

Civil Appeal

Section 5C governs appeals from judgments and orders of the Provincial

High Court of Civil Appeal. It makes the legislative intention unmistakably

clear by providing for a single direct appeal to the Supreme Court, with leave

obtained, thereby excluding any intermediate appeal to the Court of Appeal.

The section uses the clear and unequivocal expression “An appeal shall lie

27

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

directly to the Supreme Court”, underscoring the exclusivity of this appellate

route. This statutory structure is consistent with the enabling framework of

Article 138 of the Constitution, which recognises the appellate jurisdiction

of the Court of Appeal but makes its exercise “subject to the provisions of the

Constitution or of any law.”

5C(1) An appeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court from any

judgment, decree or order pronounced or entered by a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of its

jurisdiction granted by section 5A of this Act, with leave of the Supreme

Court first had and obtained. The leave requested for shall be granted

by the Supreme Court, where in its opinion the matter involves a

substantial question of law or is a matter fit for review by such Court.

(2) The Supreme Court may exercise all or any of the powers granted

to it by paragraph (2) of Article 127 of the Constitution, in regard to any

appeal made to the Supreme Court under subsection (1) of this section.

The statutory scheme contemplates only two tiers of appellate scrutiny: an

appeal from the District Court to the Court of Appeal or to the Provincial

High Court, and thereafter to the Supreme Court. It does not permit three

tiers of appellate scrutiny, such as from the District Court to the Provincial

High Court, then to the Court of Appeal, and thereafter to the Supreme

Court. Any other construction would frustrate the clear intention of the

legislature, for one of the principal objectives in establishing Provincial High

Courts was to arrest delays in the administration of justice—not to multiply

them, complicate the appellate process, or defer the attainment of finality

in litigation. In the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

(Amendment) Bill Determination (SC/SD/12/2006, SC Minutes of

20.11.2006), the Supreme Court inter alia stated that the intended

provisions “would contribute to an expeditious disposal of the alarming

backlog of cases now pending in the Court of Appeal.”

28

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

As Sansoni C.J. stated in Cassim v. Government Agent, Batticaola (1966) 69

NLR 403 at 404 “There must be finality in litigation, even if incorrect orders

have to go unreversed.”

The aforementioned position cannot vary according to the mode by which

the Court of Appeal is approached. A party dissatisfied with a judgment of

the Provincial High Court cannot create a third tier of appellate scrutiny by

describing the route as revision or restitutio in integrum. In the impugned

order, the Court of Appeal, following Gunawardane v. Muthukumarana

[2020] 3 Sri LR 306, held that such a party may invoke its revisionary

jurisdiction on the basis that it is distinct from its appellate jurisdiction. I

am unable to agree with that view.

Consider, for instance, a situation in which a Provincial High Court, in the

exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, enters judgment for the plaintiff. Two

defendants, independently contesting the case, thereafter pursue divergent

appellate remedies: one appeals to the Supreme Court with leave obtained,

whilst the other files a revision application before the Court of Appeal. If the

Supreme Court were to affirm the judgment of the Provincial High Court

while the Court of Appeal were simultaneously to set it aside, the result

would be an untenable jurisdictional conflict. Such a situation would not

only create inconsistency and uncertainty in the administration of justice,

but would also erode the hierarchical finality envisaged by the Constitution,

which recognises the Supreme Court as the apex judicial body.

Recognition of such a practice would also encourage “judge shopping” or

“forum shopping” to secure a favourable forum, which a Five Judge Bench

of this Court in JMC Jayasekara Management Centre (Pvt) Limited v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [2024/25] BLR 557 at 566

emphatically declared “must be stopped at any cost”.

29

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

At the hearing before this court, it was submitted that the reason for filing

the application in revision and restitutio in integrum before the Court of

Appeal was the plaintiff’s desire to secure an early resolution of the matter,

given the heavy workload of this court. In response, it is pertinent to recall

the words of Samarakoon C.J. in Ranasinghe v. Ceylon State Mortgage Bank

[1981] 1 Sri LR 121 at 127:

I know of no law in Sri Lanka which states that the expeditious

disposal of a case should guide a litigant in deciding the form in which

and the Court in which his action should be filed. Nor does the law

state that such considerations should guide a court in deciding whether

it is to entertain an action or not. If prudence be the guide, then no

doubt such considerations will hold sway. The law does not however

lay down such a condition.

After the introduction of the Provincial High Courts by the 13ᵗʰ Amendment

to the Constitution, the Court of Appeal and the Provincial High Court have

been vested with concurrent appellate jurisdiction. This was emphasised in

all leading cases including Swasthika Textile Industries Ltd v. Thantrige

Dayaratne [1993] 2 Sri LR 348, Gunaratne v. Thambinayagam [1993] 2 Sri

LR 355 and Abeywardene v. Ajith De Silva [1998] 1 Sri LR 134.

This is clear from the constitutional provisions as well as statutory

provisions embodied in several Acts including Acts No. 19 of 1990 and No.

54 of 2006. As Mark Fernando J. pointed out in Swasthika Textile Industries

Ltd, at page 352, “Article 154P(3)(b) conferred jurisdiction on the High Court

“notwithstanding anything in Article 138”, thus avoiding any possibility of an

argument that these provisions were contradictory, and manifesting an

intention to confer a concurrent jurisdiction.” As I have explained previously,

the procedure adopted in the Court of Appeal and Provincial High Courts is

the same.

30

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

The fact that, following the establishment of the Provincial High Courts by

the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, both the Court of Appeal and the

Provincial High Courts have been vested with concurrent appellate

jurisdiction is made abundantly clear by sections 5D and 12 of Act No. 19

of 1990. Through these provisions, the legislature has expressly authorised

appeals and applications to be heard and determined either in the Court of

Appeal or in the Provincial High Court, thereby providing an alternative

appellate forum.

Section 5D of Act No. 19 of 1990 reads as follows:

5D(1) Where any appeal or application in respect of which the

jurisdiction is granted to a High Court established by Article 154P of

the Constitution by section 5A of this Act is filed in the Court of Appeal,

such appeal or application, as the case may be, may be transferred for

hearing and determination to an appropriate High Court as may be

determined by the President of the Court of Appeal and upon such

reference, the said High Court shall hear and determine such appeal

or the application, as the case may be, as if such appeal or application

was directly made to such High Court.

(2) The President of the Court of Appeal in consultation with the Chief

Justice, may issue directions from time to time pertaining to appeals,

applications in revision and restitutio in integrum pending in the Court

of Appeal on the date of the coming into operation of this section, to be

removed for hearing and determination to an appropriate High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution. Any such direction may

be made by reference to the year in which the appeal or application, as

the case may be, was filed in the Court of Appeal and such High Court

shall be vested with jurisdiction to hear and determine such appeal or

application, as the case may be, in accordance with the provisions of

31

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

section 5A of this Act, as if such appeal or application was filed directly

in such High Court.

Section 12 of Act No. 19 of 1990 reads as follows:

12(a) Where any appeal or application is filed in the Court of Appeal

and an appeal or application in respect of the same matter has been

filed in a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution

invoking jurisdiction vested in that Court by paragraph (3) (b) or (4) of

Article 154P of the Constitution, within the time allowed for the filing of

such appeal or application, and the hearing of such appeal or

application by such High Court has not commenced, the Court of Appeal

may proceed to hear and determine such appeal or application or

where it considers it expedient to do so, direct such High Court to hear

and determine such appeal or application:

Provided, however, that where any appeal or application which is

within the jurisdiction of a High Court established by Article 154P of

the Constitution is filed in the Court of Appeal, the Court of Appeal may

if it considers it expedient to do so, order that such appeal or

application be transferred to such High Court and such High Court

shall hear and determine such appeal or application.

(b) Where the Court of Appeal decides to hear and determine any such

appeal or application, as provided for in paragraph (a), the proceedings

pending in the High Court shall stand removed to the Court of Appeal

for its determination.

(c) No appeal shall lie from the decision of the Court of Appeal under

this section to hear and determine such appeal or application or to

transfer it to a High Court.

32

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

(d) Nothing in the preceding provisions of this section shall be read and

construed as empowering the Court of Appeal to direct a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution to hear and determine

any appeal preferred to the Court of Appeal from an order made by

such High Court in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it by

paragraph (4) of Article 154P of the Constitution.

In this context, it would be legally impermissible and institutionally

unsound for the Court of Appeal, in pari materia, to sit in appeal over

judgments and orders pronounced by a Provincial High Court in the

exercise of its appellate or revisionary jurisdiction. A party cannot pursue

successive appeals before two courts of coordinate jurisdiction in respect of

the same matter. This strikes at the very root of the issue. Such a practice

is inimical to legislative intent, imposes unnecessary burdens on the

judicial system, and undermines the principle of finality in litigation. These

considerations make clear that concurrent jurisdiction was intended to

provide an alternative forum for appellate review, not to create an additional

tier in the appellate hierarchy.

In the Supreme Court case of Wickramasekera v. Officer-in-Charge, Police

Station, Ampara [2004] 1 Sri LR 257, the question of law referred to the

Supreme Court under Article 125 of the Constitution was as follows:

Does the Court of Appeal have appellate jurisdiction in terms of Article

138(1) of the Constitution read with Article 154(P)(6) in respect of

decisions of the Provincial High Court made in the exercise of its

appellate jurisdiction, or is it the Supreme Court that has jurisdiction in

appeals from the Provincial High Court as set out in section 9 of the

High Courts of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990?

Bandaranayake J. (as she then was), with the concurrence of Yapa J. and

Jayasinghe J., while emphasising at page 265 that Article 138 is an

33

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

enabling provision which expressly provides that the Court of Appeal shall

exercise appellate jurisdiction subject to the provisions of the Constitution

or of any law, answered the above question in the following manner at page

267:

The Court of Appeal does not have appellate jurisdiction in terms of

Article 138(1) of the Constitution read with Article 154P(6) in respect of

decisions of the Provincial High Court made in the exercise of its

appellate jurisdiction and it is the Supreme Court that has the

jurisdiction in respect of appeals from the Provincial High Court as set

out in section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions)

Act, No. 19 of 1990.

In Balaganeshan v. OIC, Police Station, Seeduwa (SC/SPL/LA/79/2015, SC

Minutes of 01.04.2016), Dep J. (as he then was) with the agreement of

Wanasundara J. and Jayawardena J. held:

When the Provincial High Court exercises appellate jurisdiction, it

exercises appellate jurisdiction hitherto exclusively vested in the Court

of Appeal. It exercises a parallel or concurrent jurisdiction with the

Court of Appeal. The High Court when it exercises appellate jurisdiction

it is not subordinate to the Court of Appeal. That is the basis for

conferring jurisdiction on the Supreme Court under section 9 of the High

Court of Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 to hear

appeals from the judgments of the High Court when it exercises

appellate jurisdiction. I hold that the Accused Appellant–Petitioner

should have filed a Special Leave to Appeal application against the

judgment of the High Court exercising Appellate Jurisdiction to the

Supreme Court in the first instance instead to the Court of Appeal.

In Sharif and Others vs. Wickramasuriya and Others [2010] 1 Sri LR 255 at

265, Eric Basnayake J. expressed similar sentiments:

34

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

I am of the view that the jurisdiction enjoyed by the Court of Appeal

through Article 138 remains intact. Through Article 138 one has the

liberty to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal or to resort to a

Provincial High Court in terms of Article 154P(3)(b). If one chooses to go

to the High Court, an appeal would lie to the Supreme Court with leave

first obtained from the High Court (Section 9 of the Act 19 of 1990). If

one invokes the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 138 an

appeal would lie from any final order or judgement of the Court of

Appeal to the Supreme Court with leave of Court of Appeal first

obtained (Article 128(1) of the Constitution). It is thus clear that both

courts enjoy concurrent jurisdiction on matters referred to in Article

154P(3)(b). The jurisdiction enjoyed by the Court of Appeal had not

been disturbed by Articles of the Constitution or by the Acts of

Parliament.

The same conclusion was reached by Chithrasiri J. in Sajith Dilhan

Aluthwatta v. Bandutissa (CA/40/2009, CA Minutes of 27.03.2009):

However, the appellate jurisdiction in respect of appeals and revisions

of the judgments, decrees and orders delivered and made by a District

Court or a Family Court including the applications of restitutio in

integrum has been exercised exclusively by the Court of Appeal until

the High Courts of Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act

No.54 of 2006 came into operation. Thus, it is clear that with the

enactment of the aforesaid Act No.54 of 2006, appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and orders

delivered and made by a District Court or a Family Court are now being

exercised concurrently by the Court of Appeal and the High Courts

established under Article 154(P) of the Constitution.

35

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

In Nishantha Fernando v. Attorney-General (CA/MC/RE/4/2017, SC

Minutes of 08.06.2018), Amarasekara J. (with the agreement of Nawaz J.)

held:

The petitioner had filed revision applications in Gampaha High Court

seeking revision of the said orders made by the learned magistrate and

the said high court has dismissed the applications. It must be noted

that high courts now exercise the same revisionary jurisdiction once

this court exercised over magistrate courts. As he has filed revision

applications on the same orders previously in the High Court of

Gampaha he has exhausted his remedy. His position is that his

lawyers have not brought to the notice of High Court the facts averred

in this petition. A party to an action cannot be given a chance to have

a second bite of the same cherry. If this court allows this application it

may create a bad precedent to allow a party who fails to present his

case properly file another application.

In Seylan Bank PLC v. Christobel Daniels (CA/PHC/APN/58/2014, CA

Minutes of 14.12.2016), Nawaz J. opined:

The structure of Article 138 would also prevent this Court exercising

revisionary jurisdiction when the sole and exclusive jurisdiction has

been vested in the Supreme Court. The revisionary jurisdiction is

bestowed in the Court of Appeal thus in Article 138 of the Constitution.

“..... and sole and exclusive cognizance by way of appeal, revision and

restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions,

matters and things which such High Court, Court of First Instance,

tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance”.

It is crystal clear beyond any scintilla of doubt that the revisionary

power of this Court lies only against orders made by such High Court,

Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution when they have

36

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

taken cognizance of causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and

things. The words “such High Court, Court of First Instance, tribunal or

other institution” must be read ejusdem generis and such collocation of

words read together with the words causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things clearly indicates that these Courts

exercise original jurisdiction. Only when the High Court of First

Instance, tribunal or other institution has exercised original jurisdiction,

revision lies to this court. In other words, only when the High Court has

exercised original jurisdiction, the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court

can be invoked. In my view Article 138 intentionally suggests such a

deliberate intendment of Parliament and when the High Court has sat

in its appellate jurisdiction as has happened in this case, no revision

lies to this Court.

Gunaratne v. Indika Sampath (CA/PHC/APN/54/2013/REV, CA Minutes of

23.09.2013) was a partition action in which the plaintiff sought to invoke

the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal against the judgment of

the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal. Dismissing the application in

limine without issuing notice, Salam J. observed:

The question that now arises for consideration is whether the Court of

Appeal can exercise its revisionary powers under Article 138 of the

Constitution in respect of a judgment of the High Court pronounced

under the Provisions of Act No 54 of 2006 when the proper remedy is

to appeal to the Supreme Court. Appreciably, Section 5A of Act No 54

of 2006 quite specifically states that all relevant written laws

applicable to an appeal, in the Court of Appeal are applicable to the

High Court as well. This undoubtedly demonstrates beyond any iota of

doubt that the scheme provided by Act No 54 of 2006 to facilitate an

appeal being heard by the Provincial High Court is nothing but a clear

transfer of jurisdiction and in effect could be said that as far as appeals

37

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

are concerned both the High Court and the Court of Appeal rank equally

and are placed on par with each other. Arising from this statement of

law, it must be understood that if the Court of Appeal cannot act in

revision in respect of a judgment it pronounces in a civil appeal, then it

cannot sit in revision over a judgment entered by the High Court in the

exercise of its civil appellate jurisdiction as well, for both courts are to

be equally ranked when they exercise civil appellate jurisdiction.

In Ramalingam v. Parameswary [2000] 2 Sri LR 340 at 348 Wigneswaran J.

reiterated the principle that when two courts exercise concurrent

jurisdiction, they stand on the same footing within that sphere of

jurisdiction:

The whole purpose of the Thirteenth Amendment establishing a High

Court in every province was to confer jurisdiction in respect of certain

matters in the High Court granting it concurrent jurisdiction with the

Court of Appeal. When concurrent or parallel jurisdiction is given by

Law to two Courts the question of a superior and inferior Court would

not arise. As far as the jurisdiction granted to the two Courts in certain

matters goes, they are equal.

In Laksiri v. Officer in Charge Anti Vice Squad and Another [2012] 1 Sri LR

131 at 135, Ranjith Silva J. with the agreement of Abrew J. stated:

Therefore we find that Court of Appeal will not have the jurisdiction to

entertain a matter by way of revision in derogation of the statutory

powers specifically conferred on the Supreme Court by the 13th

Amendment to the Constitution read with Section 9 of the High Court

of the Province (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, even in

exceptional circumstances.

38

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

Commercial High Courts

In respect of appeals against judgments and orders of the Provincial High

Courts established under the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act No. 10 of 1996, to hear and determine specified commercial

disputes, commonly referred to as Commercial High Courts, the statutory

scheme provides for only a single appeal, which lies directly to the Supreme

Court. Section 5 of the Act reads as follows:

5(1) Any person who is dissatisfied with any judgement pronounced

by a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution, in the

exercise of its jurisdiction under section 2, in any action, proceeding or

matter to which such person is a party may prefer an appeal to the

Supreme Court against such judgement for any error in fact or in law.

(2) Any person who is dissatisfied with any order made by a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution, in the exercise of its

jurisdiction under section 2 in the course of any action, proceeding or

matter to which such person is, or seeks to be, a party, may prefer an

appeal to the Supreme Court against such Order for the correction of

any error in fact or in law, with the leave of the Supreme Court first had

and obtained.

(3) In this section, the expressions “judgment” and “order” shall have

the same meanings respectively, as in section 754(5) of the Civil

Procedure Code (Chapter 101).

It has been consistently held in a series of decisions including Merchant

Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd v. Perera [2012] BLR 14, Australanka Exporters (Pvt)

Ltd v. Indian Bank [2001] 2 Sri LR 156, Senanayake v. Koehn [2002] 3 Sri

LR 381, Kosala Bandara Bakmeewewa v. The Finance PLC

(CA/PHC/APN/97/2007, CA Minutes of 13.06.2016), and Kumara Perera

v. Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd [2019] 2 Sri LR 533 that the Court of

39

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

Appeal has no jurisdiction to set aside judgments or orders of the

Commercial High Court by way of final appeal, revision, or restitutio in

integrum, as such jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Supreme Court.

It is significant to note that substantially the same language has been

employed in section 5C of Act No. 19 of 1990 in relation to appeals against

judgments and orders of the Provincial High Courts of Civil Appeal, and

there is no justification for drawing a distinction between the two

provisions. Both must therefore be construed in a consistent manner.

In Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd v. Perera [2012] BLR 14, the defendant

filed a revision application before the Court of Appeal against an order made

by the Provincial High Court in the Western Province established by the

High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996. The

Supreme Court held that, following the enactment of that Act, a person

dissatisfied with any judgment or order of a Provincial High Court

established thereunder may appeal only to the Supreme Court in terms of

section 5, and that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to entertain an

appeal or revision application against a judgment or order pronounced by

such a Provincial High Court. Suresh Chandra J., with the concurrence of

Marsoof J. and Ekanayake J., observed at page 18:

The sequence of the enactment of the Acts makes it evident that in

relation to a matter in the District Court the Right to Appeal from a

judgment would be to the Court of Appeal and then if leave is granted

an appeal would lie to the Supreme Court. By the enactment of Act

No.10 of 1996 it is clear that in any civil matter dealt with in the High

Court, the Right of Appeal lies only to the Supreme Court. This seems

to be the clear intention of the Legislature with regard to matters dealt

in the High Court. When the above special provisions are being

considered in the High Court, if revisionary jurisdiction to the Court of

Appeal is given then it would give the party applying for revision in a

40

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

situation as in the present case a favourable position by granting an

additional opportunity of review as against a party who comes within

the purview of the civil jurisdiction of the High Court regarding other

matters as they will be entitled only to the right to appeal to the

Supreme Court. This would be due to the fact that if the revisionary

jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal is allowed then if need be the party

would have the option to go further to the Supreme Court by way of

canvassing the judgment of the Court of Appeal in such instances. This

would give the party in such circumstances two opportunities of review

of the preliminary judgment when the clear intention of the Legislature

is that there should be only an appeal to the Supreme Court from any

judgment or order of the High Court in the exercise of its Civil

Jurisdiction in terms of Sections 5(1) and 5(2). Further it would be

illogical to consider that a party is entitled to have recourse to the Court

of Appeal to exercise its Revisionary jurisdiction (and consequently an

appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court) if it is in relation to a matter

under S.329 where an appeal is denied, while an appeal is available

to a party only to the Supreme Court in other matters where the High

Court has been granted civil jurisdiction.

In Australanka Exporters (Pvt) Ltd v. Indian Bank [2001] 2 Sri LR 156 at 159,

Raja Fernando J. stated:

Section 5 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.

10 of 1996 has clearly enacted that “Any person who is dissatisfied

with any judgment pronounced by a High Court established by Article

154(P) of the Constitution, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under

Section 2, in any action proceeding on matters to which such person is

a party may prefer an appeal to the Supreme Court against such

judgment, for any error in fact or in law.” Appellate jurisdiction in

respect of judgments and orders of the High Court of the Provinces

41

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

made in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the

Supreme Court.

In Kumara Perera v. Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd [2019] 2 Sri LR 533, it

was held that “the Court of Appeal lacks jurisdiction to entertain an

application for restitutio in integrum from the judgment of the Commercial

High Court.”

Applications for restitutio in integrum

It must be observed that neither Article 154P of the Constitution nor any

provision of Act No. 19 of 1990 expressly confers jurisdiction in restitutio in

integrum on the Provincial High Courts. By section 5A(1) of Act No. 19 of

1990, the Provincial High Courts were vested only with “appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction” in respect of judgments and orders of the District

Court, Family Court and Small Claims Court within the Province. This

omission is of particular significance since applications for restitutio in

integrum are filed against judgments of District Courts in partition cases.

Taking advantage of this ambiguity, litigants who are unable to exercise a

statutory right of appeal against judgments of the District Court tend to

approach the Court of Appeal under Article 138 of the Constitution,

invoking its jurisdiction by way of revision and restitutio in integrum, on the

footing that the Provincial High Courts of Civil Appeal lack restitutio in

integrum jurisdiction. Such an approach, however, defeats the legislative

intent underlying the establishment of the Provincial High Courts of Civil

Appeal.

Nevertheless, by section 5D(2) of Act No. 19 of 1990, the legislature has not

altogether excluded the Provincial High Courts of Civil Appeal from

entertaining such applications. That provision expressly empowers the

President of the Court of Appeal to transfer to the relevant Provincial High

Court of Civil Appeal pending appeals, applications in revision, and

42

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

applications for restitutio in integrum for hearing and determination. If the

Provincial High Courts were entirely devoid of restitutio in integrum

jurisdiction, the statutory authority to transfer such applications would be

rendered meaningless, and the receiving court would lack competence to

determine the matter. Section 5D(2), which authorises the President of the

Court of Appeal to transfer such applications to the Provincial High Courts

of Civil Appeal, reflects the legislative intention that those courts should

possess jurisdiction to hear and determine restitutio in integrum

applications in appropriate cases.

In Aluthwatta v. Bandutissa and Others (CA/40/2009, CA Minutes of

27.03.2009) Chithrasiri J. highlighted this aspect in the following manner:

This is an application made in terms of Article 138(1) of the Constitution

of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka by which all appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which shall

be committed by any Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution

has been conferred upon the Court of Appeal.

At this stage, it is necessary to mention that all restitutio in integrum

applications also could be covered by a revision application even

though all revisions do not fall into the category of restitution. However,

it is difficult to define applications of restitutio in integrum specifying

clear boundaries. Therefore, it is possible to invoke jurisdiction of this

Court even for reversionary matters if those are coupled with

restitution. This will pave the way to have almost all revision

applications being filed in this Court. More importantly, such a situation

would permit to overcome the object of the Legislature of having

appellate jurisdiction over judgments and orders of District Courts to

the High Courts established in the respective Provinces.

43

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

However, it is pertinent to mention that in terms of Section 5(D)(1) of the

Act No.54 of 2006, the President of the Court of Appeal has the power

to transfer new cases that are filed in the Court of Appeal to the

appropriate High Court for determination. Under those circumstances,

we are of the view that this case be referred to the President of the

Court of Appeal in order to transfer this case to the appropriate High

Court in terms of the provisions contained in Section 5(D)(1) of the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of

2006.

In consequence, in Aluthwatta’s case, the Court of Appeal directed that the

said application for revision and restitutio in integrum be transferred to the

relevant Provincial High Court for hearing and determination.

Given that the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal is expressly vested with

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees, and

orders of the District Court, Family Court, and Small Claims Court within

the Province, it would be incongruous in practice to exclude restitutio in

integrum, as applications in revision and restitutio in integrum are commonly

pleaded together and operate in a complementary manner. I agree with the

observations made by Chithrasiri J. in Aluthwatta’s case that “all restitutio

in integrum applications also could be covered by a revision application even

though all revisions do not fall into the category of restitution.”

In this backdrop, I would strongly recommend that the legislature amend

section 5A(1) of Act No. 19 of 1990 so as to state the position expressly. For

clarity, section 5A(1), which presently reads “shall have and exercise

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction”, may usefully be amended to read:

“shall have and exercise appellate, revisionary, and restitutio in integrum

jurisdiction”.

44

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

Gunawardane v. Muthukumarana

The Court of Appeal relied heavily on the judgment of this court in

Gunawardane v. Muthukumarana [2020] 3 Sri LR 306 in overruling the

preliminary objection raised by the defendant on jurisdiction. In that case,

at page 310, this court held as follows:

Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No.

19 of 1990, as amended, does not oust the revisionary jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal in respect of decisions made by a Provincial High

Court exercising its appellate powers. Therefore, the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal referred to in Article 138 of the

Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka can be invoked in order to

canvass a decision made by a Provincial High Court exercising its

appellate powers.

With all due respect, I am unable to agree with that conclusion. That

judgment is predominantly premised on the conceptual separation of

revision from appeal, in the manner adopted by Sansoni C.J. in the oft-

quoted decision in Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohomed (1965) 68 NLR 36,

where it was observed at page 38:

The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite

independent of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court.

Its object is the due administration of justice and the correction of

errors, sometimes committed by this Court itself, in order to avoid

miscarriages of justice. It is exercised in some cases by a Judge of his

own motion, when an aggrieved person who may not be a party to the

action brings to his notice the fact that, unless the power is exercised,

injustice will result. The Partition Act has not, I conceive, made any

change in this respect, and the power can still be exercised in respect

of any order or decree of a lower Court.

45

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

When Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohomed was decided in 1965, Sri Lanka

was governed by the Soulbury Constitution. Neither the Soulbury

Constitution nor the First Republican Constitution of 1972 contained any

provision equivalent to Article 138 of the present Constitution of 1978,

which expressly enacts the appellate, revisionary, and restitutio in integrum

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, to be exercised “subject to the provisions

of the Constitution or of any law.”

Indeed, the Supreme Court in Gunawardane, at page 314, acknowledged:

“At the outset, it must be borne in mind that the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal is a Constitutional mandate. Its genesis lies in Article 138 of

the Constitution.” However, both the Supreme Court in Gunawardane and

the Court of Appeal in the instant case failed to properly appreciate that

Article 138 is not an entrenched provision but an enabling one. Article

138(1) itself makes plain that the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal “by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum” is “subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law”. Nevertheless, both courts

proceeded on the footing that, in the absence of an express exclusion, the

Court of Appeal continues to retain revisionary jurisdiction over judgments

of the Provincial High Court.

At page 316 of Gunawardane, it was further stated: “As I observed earlier,

the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is a Constitutional mandate

which, undoubtedly, is subject to the provisions of statutory law.

Nevertheless, owing to its genesis in the Constitution, any restriction or

modification which the Legislature seeks to introduce must be introduced by

way of express wording.” In my view, this reasoning is untenable. Whilst

conferring revisionary jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal, the Constitution

itself expressly stipulates that such jurisdiction is “subject to the provisions

of the Constitution or of any law.” When the Constitution at the outset makes

clear that the revisionary jurisdiction is conditional and not absolute, there

46

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

is no need for express words of exclusion. Parliament, by ordinary

legislation, is empowered to regulate, modify, or reallocate such jurisdiction.

To hold otherwise would elevate Article 138(1) to a status of entrenchment

which the Constitution has not conferred.

This is consistent with the principle affirmed in Swasthika Textile Industries

Ltd v. Dayaratne, where the Supreme Court held that appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction under Article 138(1) is not entrenched and can be

altered by ordinary law. In that case, the Supreme Court held that section

31DD, introduced into the Industrial Disputes Act by Act No. 32 of 1990,

which provides that: “Any workman, trade union or employer who is

aggrieved by any final order of a High Court established under Article 154P

of the Constitution, in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by

law or in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction vested in it by law, in

relation to an order of a Labour Tribunal, may appeal therefrom to the

Supreme Court with the leave of the High Court or the Supreme Court first

had and obtained”, removed the appellate and revisionary jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal in respect of final orders of the High Court made in relation

to orders of Labour Tribunals, and vested such jurisdiction exclusively in

the Supreme Court. In that instance also, there was no express removal of

the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. This position was

subsequently accepted as correct by a Bench of five Judges of this court in

Abeywardene v. Ajith De Silva [1998] 1 Sri LR 134 at 140.

As I have emphasised repeatedly, Provincial High Courts were vested with

special jurisdiction under Acts Nos. 19 of 1990, 10 of 1996, and 54 of 2006

with the specific objective of arresting delays in the administration of

justice. Sansoni C.J. in Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohomed did not recognise

the revisionary power as an absolute and unqualified principle of law;

rather, His Lordship acknowledged that its exercise is subject to legislative

intent. This is apparent from his explicit observation in the above excerpt

47

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

that “The Partition Act has not, I conceive, made any change in this respect,

and the power [of revision] can still be exercised in respect of any order or

decree of a lower Court”, thus recognising that the legislature could, through

statute, alter or limit the scope of revisionary powers.

Unlike the Partition Act considered in Mariam Beebee, Acts Nos. 19 of 1990,

10 of 1996, and 54 of 2006 expressly restructure appellate jurisdiction and,

by their terms, exclude any intermediate recourse to the Court of Appeal

from judgments and orders of Provincial High Courts exercising their

appellate jurisdiction. The legislative design, read together with the enabling

nature of Article 138, leaves no scope for the Court of Appeal to invoke its

appellate, revisionary or restitutio in integrum jurisdiction in such instances,

without disregarding the clear statutory command and frustrating the very

object of the Provincial High Court scheme.

The Supreme Court in Gunawardane, at pages 310–311, declined to follow

Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd v. Perera [2012] BLR 14 and Australanka

Exporters (Pvt) Ltd v. Indian Bank [2001] 2 Sri LR 156, which held that the

Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction, whether by way of appeal or revision,

over judgments and orders of the Provincial High Courts established under

Act No. 10 of 1996 on the ground that “both these cases had dealt with the

issues pertaining to appeals arising out of matters where the Provincial High

Court had exercised its original jurisdiction, whereas the case before us

raises issues with regard to its appellate jurisdiction. Therefore, I am of the

opinion that these decisions do not have a direct bearing on the matter at

hand.” I regret my inability to agree with that reasoning. If, under Act No.

10 of 1996, the exercise of original jurisdiction by a Provincial High Court

admits only a single direct appeal to the Supreme Court, it would be

logically inconsistent to contend that, when the Provincial High Court

exercises appellate jurisdiction, whether by way of final appeal, revision, or

48

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

restitutio in integrum, the law permits two successive appeals, first to the

Court of Appeal and thereafter to the Supreme Court.

Gunawardane has not been followed in several subsequent decisions,

including Abeydasa v. People’s Bank (CA/CPA/124/2021, CA Minutes of

05.06.2023) and Malwatta v. Softlogic Finance PLC and Others

(CA/CPA/152/2022, CA Minutes of 31.08.2023). In the latter case,

Prasantha De Silva J., inter alia, identified several practical difficulties that

would arise if the Court of Appeal were permitted to review judgments and

orders of the Provincial High Courts made in the exercise of their appellate

jurisdiction. That case concerned a party who, being dissatisfied with a

judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal delivered in the

exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction, sought once again to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal against the judgment of the

Provincial High Court. In practical terms, this amounted to two successive

applications in revision being pursued in respect of the same judgment of

the District Court, although the second application was formally directed

against the judgment of the Provincial High Court.

Moreover, if litigants are allowed to file a revision application in the

Court of Appeal against a judgment or order given by the Provincial

High Court exercising revisionary jurisdiction it would lead to

unnecessary duplication of court proceedings. This could result in a

revision application being filed in the Court of Appeal while an appeal

is pending in the Supreme Court. It would also have the effect of the

Court of Appeal being given an opportunity to overrule a judgment of

the Supreme Court if the revision application is successful while the

appeal to the Supreme Court is not, which is an unintended absurdity.

(……)

49

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

It is highly unlikely that parliament or the legislative draftsmen

intended to manifestly complicate the appeal process when the

Provincial High Courts have been introduced to reduce and simplify the

court process not to complicate it even further. According to the legal

maxim ‘Boni judicis est lites dirimere, ne lis ex lite oritur, et interest

republicae ut sint fines litium’, it is the duty of a good judge to prevent

litigations, that suit may not grow out of suits, and it concerns the

welfare of the State that an end be put to litigation. It would be contrary

to the practice of a good judge to interpret statutes in a manner that

would give rise to unnecessary complications in the judicial process.

I would also mention here that allowing an appeal or a revision

application from a judgment or order from the Provincial High Court

would also lead to, the Court of Appeal having revisionary jurisdiction

over an instance where the Provincial High Court exercises its

revisionary jurisdiction as is requested for in the instant case. In effect,

the Court of Appeal would lie in revision of a revision application.

Seeing as Revisionary jurisdiction is to be exercised in exceptional

circumstances, allowing a revision application on a revision application

would be conceptually contradictory to the spirit of a revision

application. In the instant case, for example, this court is invited to lie

in revision of a revision application filed in the Provincial High Court.

Conclusion

In my view, the reasoning in Gunawardane v. Muthukumarana [2020] 3 Sri

LR 306 cannot be reconciled with the clear statutory scheme established by

Acts Nos. 19 of 1990, 10 of 1996, and 54 of 2006, read in conjunction with

Article 138 of the Constitution. The approach adopted by the Supreme

Court in Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd v. Perera [2012] BLR 14 accords

with both the constitutional framework and the legislative intent and, in my

respectful view, ought to be preferred. I would further add that the dicta in

50

SC/APPEAL/65/2025

Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd v. Perera applies not only to Provincial High

Courts established under Act No. 10 of 1996, but equally to those

established under Act No. 19 of 1990, as amended by Act No. 54 of 2006.

Hence, I hold that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction, whether by way

of final appeal, revision, or restitutio in integrum, to review the judgments or

orders of the Provincial High Court, whether in the exercise of its appellate

jurisdiction under Act No. 19 of 1990, as amended by Act No. 54 of 2006,

or in the exercise of its original jurisdiction under Act No. 10 of 1996. Such

jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Supreme Court.

I answer the question of law on which special leave to appeal was granted

in favour of the defendant-appellant. The order of the Court of Appeal dated

15.11.2022 is set aside and the appeal is allowed. The application filed by

the plaintiff-respondent against the judgment of the Provincial High Court

of Civil Appeal shall stand dismissed. The defendant is entitled to costs in

all three courts.
