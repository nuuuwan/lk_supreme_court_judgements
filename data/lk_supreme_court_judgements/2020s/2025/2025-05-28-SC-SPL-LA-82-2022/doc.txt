ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 28th May 2025

JANAK DE SILVA, J

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent-Petitioner and the learned

Presidentâ€™s Counsel for the Appellant-Respondent heard.

Court is of the view that leave to appeal should be granted on the following

question of law:

1) Did the Court of Appeal err in considering whether the provisions of

Section 7(1) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 as amended

is directory or mandatory in the absence of a specific question of law being

raised as part of the Case Stated?

At this stage, both Counsel agree that the Court can proceed to hear and

determine this question of law acting under the proviso to Rule 16 of the

Supreme Court Rules.

Section 11A(6) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act as amended empowers two or

more Judges of the Court of Appeal to hear and determine any question of law

arising on the Case Stated. Accordingly, it is clear that the questions of law that

can be argued before the Court of Appeal is not limited to the questions of law

sent by the Tax Appeals Commission but can include questions of law arising

from the Case Stated which the Court may frame before the argument is taken

up ex mero motu or on the application of any one of the parties.

However, we observe that in this particular case, the Court of Appeal did not

raise any specific question of law on the directory or mandatory nature of Section

7(1) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act as amended and therefore the

observation and conclusion that the Court of Appeal makes in the judgment at

page 15 in holding that the provisions in Section 7(1) is directory is wrong in law

and must be set aside. Accordingly, we set aside that part of the judgment of the

Court of Appeal. The rest of the Judgment of the Court of Appeal stands.

We direct the Tax Appeals Commission to hear parties on any objections that

may be taken in terms of Section 7(1) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act and

all others matters that may be raised before them and make order according to

law. For sake of completeness, we state that we have not examined whether the

requirements in Section 7(1) of the Act is directory or mandatory. This order is

based on the Court of Appeal having gone into that matter without raising a

specific question of law before the argument of the case was taken up.
