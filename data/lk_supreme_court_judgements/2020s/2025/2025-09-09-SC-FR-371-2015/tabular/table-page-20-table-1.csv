"Language  clearly  provides  for  the  actual  full  name  of  the  candidate  who"
"tendered the said application under the above number. It also shows that the"
"official address of the said candidate as prison lockup Balapitiya."
"In the said application, other than the full name written in Sinhala, his name"
"has been  written in  English as “Kumara B.D.C.D.”, rather than the correct"
"English initials of “G.D.C.D.”, while the official address has also been stated"
"as Prison Lockup, Balapitiya, in English language."
"The document marked 1R2, which is the admission card issued bearing the"
"examination  index  No.  as  0356,  which  is  the  same  number  given  in  the"
"application, shows that the mistake made in writing the candidate’s name in"
"English  language  by  whoever  the  person  who  wrote  it  had  been  carried"
"forward to the admission card as well, though his official address has been"
"correctly mentioned."
"The common result sheet issued by the Department of Examinations, which"
"has been tendered along with the affidavit of the 1st respondent dated 30-09-"
"2016 marked as 1R5, clearly shows that the same mistake as to the name of"
"the candidate with index No.0356 has been repeated, obviously, as a result of"
"the  earlier  mistake.  The  said  candidate  has  obtained  77  marks  which  was"
"more  than  the  pass  mark.  The  result  sheet  and  the  mark  sheet  issued  in"
"relation to the said index number marked 1R6 and 1R7 respectively, confirms"
"that fact."
"However, the prison officer who tendered his application to sit for the same"
"examination  under  application  No.  0357  has  also  been  one  Kumara  who"
"carried  the  same  surname  as  the  candidate  who  submitted  the  application"
"No. 0356. The document marked 1R8 confirms the fact that the said officer’s"
"name is Murukkuwa Durage Sisira Kumara, whose official address was Sri"
"Lanka Prisons, Galle. The said application as well has been filled in Sinhala"
"Language. The said application also shows that the applicant’s name has been"
"written  in  English  to  read  as  “Kumara  M.D.S.”  and  his  official  address  as"
"“Galle Prison, Galle”."
