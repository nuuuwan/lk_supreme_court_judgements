Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The petitioners preferred this application alleging that their fundamental

rights have been infringed due to the actions of one or more respondents

named in the petition, and thereby, claiming redress.

When this matter was considered on 05-05-2016 for granting of Leave to

Proceed, this Court granted leave for the alleged infringement of the

Page 15 of 26

petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

Having considered the application preferred by a few more petitioners seeking

intervention into the application on the basis that they are also similarly

circumstanced as the original petitioners and their fundamental rights have

also been infringed, this Court allowed their intervention on 11-05-2016, and

added them as the 65th, 66th and 67th respondents.

Hence, the 27 petitioners and the 65th, 66th and 67th respondents will

hereinafter be commonly referred to as the petitioners for the purposes of

determining whether their fundamental rights have been violated as alleged.

The facts that led to the filing of this fundamental rights application as stated

in the petitions can be summarized in the following manner.

All the petitioners are employees of the Department of Prisons functioning as

either Prisons Sergeants or Prison Guards at the time of filing of this

application.

The 61st respondent being the then Commissioner General of Prisons had

called for applications from the qualified officers of the Department of Prisons

to fill the following vacancies;

1. Jailer Class (II) Male: 58

2. Jailer Class (II) Female: 04

3. Welfare Officers Class (II): 05

The petitioners as well as several other officers have applied to sit for the

written competitive exam scheduled to be held in that regard. The 2nd

respondent, the Commissioner General of Prisons, has delegated his power of

holding the said exam to the 1st respondent named in the petition, namely,

the Commissioner General of Examinations of the Department of

Examinations.

Accordingly, the said exam had been conducted, and the 4th to 60th

respondents named in the petition have been promoted to fill the said

vacancies based on the marks they obtained.

Page 16 of 26

The petitioners have admitted the fact that the 24th to 27th petitioners have

previously invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court in SC/FR

Application bearing No. 85/2014, and the said case was dismissed by this

Court on 20-05-2014. However, the petitioners have claimed that after the

pronouncement of the said judgment, the petitioners are now in possession

of new material, which they did not possess at the time of the initial

application. It is on that basis they have initiated this fundamental rights

application before this Court.

The petitioners state that around 900 fellow officers including they themselves

sat for the competitive examination and it was the 3rd respondent named in

the petition, who is a Superintendent of Prisons attached to the Prisons

Headquarters, who set the relevant question paper and the marking scheme.

It has been alleged that majority of the candidates who passed the

examination were from the Prison Headquarters and Prison Training College,

and the 4th and the 5th respondent, being the husband and wife, had obtained

exactly the same marks. It has been alleged further that they have credible

information that the marking scheme and the question paper had been

circulated among some of the candidates prior to the examination. The

petitioners have also intimated the respective marks obtained by them at the

examination, which range from 54 to 74.

Having narrated the above facts, they have averred that they are in possession

of new documentary evidence to show that their fundamental rights have been

infringed as pleaded by them. It has been alleged that one G.D.C.D. Kumara,

the 28th respondent named in this application, who was the 23rd intervenient

petitioner in the previous SC/FR Application No. 85/2014, had been

promoted after sitting for the competitive examination which was held on 26-

01-2014. The petitioners contend that they are now in possession of the result

sheet of the said 28th respondent whose index number was 0357 where he

has only obtained a final mark of 54 (the document marked P-06 along with

the petition).

Page 17 of 26

The petitioners also allege that the eligibility to sit for the said competitive

exam was having a satisfactory service of 5 years, but the 40th respondent

who had a charge sheet dated 02-11-2013 preferred against him was allowed

to sit for the exam. It is alleged that he was later found guilty to the charges

and was punished by the letter dated 03-08-2014, by suspending two salary

increments, with a fine of Rs.30,000/- while holding him ineligible of facing

any promotional interviews.

The petitioners allege that the officers who marked the examination papers

were not qualified enough to mark the same, and the departmental standing

orders as to the manner in which the questions should be marked where it

had been stated that they should be marked twice by two different markers

had not been followed. It had further been alleged that although the marks

were released on 01-03-2014, the same was not published in the website of

the Department of Prisons as of usual practice. It was their contention that

the names of the officers who are entitled to be promoted were also not

published, but their results were received individually by post.

It has been the position of the petitioners that, being officers who obtained

equal or more marks than the 28th respondent G.D.C.D. Kumara who was

later promoted, they should be considered as a group of officers treated

unequally among equals.

It was primarily on the basis of the alleged marks of the 28th respondent, this

matter was argued before this Court claiming that the petitioners

fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

had been infringed by the respondents.

The 1st respondent in his affidavit tendered to this Court has proceeded to

explain the alleged marks given to the 28th respondent explaining that the

28th respondents initials had been stated wrongly in the admission card and

the initial result sheet issued to him in that regard. It has been his position

that this has occurred due to an administrative error. It has been submitted

further that due to yet another error, the candidate who sat for the

examination under Index No. 0357 having a similar surname has been issued

Page 18 of 26

with a result sheet that carries the initials of the candidate who sat for the

exam under Index No. 0356.

He has submitted that after the matter was subsequently brought to the

notice of the Department of Examinations, the Department corrected the said

administrative error in relation to the names of the candidates, and as a

result, it was confirmed that the 28th respondent who was issued with

admission card No. 0356, in fact received 77 marks and the candidate who

was issued with admission card No. 0357 received 54 marks. It has been his

position that after the correction by the Department of Examinations, the 28th

respondent has been correctly promoted based on his marks. The 1st

respondent has submitted the documents marked 1R1 to 1R12 to

substantiate his position.

At the hearing of this application, this Court heard the submissions of the

learned Presidents Counsel who represented the petitioners as well as that of

the learned Presidents Counsel who represented 65th to 67th respondents who

contended that the said petitioners fundamental rights have been infringed

due to the reasons averred in their respective petitions.

This Court also heard the submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General

(DSG) who represented 1st to 3rd and 62nd to 64th respondents.

The Court also had the benefit of considering the written submissions

tendered by the parties in relation to their respective stands, and also had the

benefit of looking at the original answer scripts and mark sheets of the

candidates who were allocated index No. 0356 and 0357, for the purposes of

this judgment.

Having considered the material placed before this Court it is my view that

although the petitioners have made several other allegations so as to suggest

that there were several irregularities in the manner in which the examination

was conducted, and the examination papers may have been leaked before the

conduct of the examination, I find that the said allegations have been made

on a mere speculation rather than on a sound basis which is acceptable to

the Court.

Page 19 of 26

However, the main ground under which they have relied to claim infringement

of their fundamental rights in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

appears to be the marks obtained by the 28th respondent on the basis that he

was promoted despite having obtained 54 marks, whereas the pass mark set

was 75.

It was on that premise; they have claimed that they were treated differently

although they were similarly circumstanced.

It needs to be noted that the questioned examination held in order to grant

promotions was an examination that had been conducted by the Department

of Examinations which is the premier government institution with vast

experience in conducting examinations in Sri Lanka.

It is clear that the Commissioner General of Prisons had delegated his power

to conduct the questioned examination to the Commissioner General of

Examinations in order to ensure the credibility of the process of granting

promotions to the eligible officers of the Department. I have no reason to doubt

that the Department of Examinations had conducted the examination in

violation of the procedure and the relevant norms, or had marked the answer

scripts in a biased manner so that preferred candidates would get any

advantage.

Having said that, I will now proceed to consider whether the 28th respondent

had been granted the promotion despite him having obtained 54 marks, which

was a much lesser mark than the pass mark of 75.

Although an allegation has been made that most of those who were successful

in obtaining the pass marks were officers who have been serving in the Prison

Headquarters or Prison Training School, it has been established that the 28th

respondent was serving in the prison lockup in Balapitiya at the time he sat

for the examination.

When qualified officers were called to submit their applications to sit for the

exam, the said officer whose name is Gamathige Don Chaminda Deepthi

Kumara has tendered his application No. 0356, which has been marked and

produced as 1R1 to this Court. The said application which is in Sinhala

Page 20 of 26

Language clearly provides for the actual full name of the candidate who

tendered the said application under the above number. It also shows that the

official address of the said candidate as prison lockup Balapitiya.

In the said application, other than the full name written in Sinhala, his name

has been written in English as Kumara B.D.C.D., rather than the correct

English initials of G.D.C.D., while the official address has also been stated

as Prison Lockup, Balapitiya, in English language.

The document marked 1R2, which is the admission card issued bearing the

examination index No. as 0356, which is the same number given in the

application, shows that the mistake made in writing the candidates name in

English language by whoever the person who wrote it had been carried

forward to the admission card as well, though his official address has been

correctly mentioned.

The common result sheet issued by the Department of Examinations, which

has been tendered along with the affidavit of the 1st respondent dated 30-09-

2016 marked as 1R5, clearly shows that the same mistake as to the name of

the candidate with index No.0356 has been repeated, obviously, as a result of

the earlier mistake. The said candidate has obtained 77 marks which was

more than the pass mark. The result sheet and the mark sheet issued in

relation to the said index number marked 1R6 and 1R7 respectively, confirms

that fact.

However, the prison officer who tendered his application to sit for the same

examination under application No. 0357 has also been one Kumara who

carried the same surname as the candidate who submitted the application

No. 0356. The document marked 1R8 confirms the fact that the said officers

name is Murukkuwa Durage Sisira Kumara, whose official address was Sri

Lanka Prisons, Galle. The said application as well has been filled in Sinhala

Language. The said application also shows that the applicants name has been

written in English to read as Kumara M.D.S. and his official address as

Galle Prison, Galle.

Page 21 of 26

Upon this application, the said officer, namely M.D.S. Kumara, has been

issued with the admission card with index No. 0357 under the name Kumara

M.D.S. giving official address as Galle Prison, Galle (the document marked

1R9).

However, when issuing the results sheet of the said candidate (the document

marked 1R10), it clearly appears that due to a mistake, his name has been

referred to as Kumara G.D.C.D., which carried the actual initials of the officer

who submitted application No.0356, and sat for the examination under the

said number. Although the name has been wrongly mentioned, his official

address has been correctly mentioned as Galle Prison, Galle. He has obtained

54 marks, which was lower than the pass mark.

I find that this is the document the petitioners have used to claim that the

28th respondent named in their petition as G.D.C.D. Kumara of Sirikirina,

Magura/West, Baduraliya was promoted despite obtaining low marks than

the pass mark.

However, the letter issued by the Department of Examinations on 19-03-2014

to Commissioner General of Prisons, which has been marked as 1R12 along

with the 1st respondents objections, establishes that the said discrepancy as

to the names has been corrected. It has been specifically stated in the said

letter that the correction of names has not resulted in any change of the marks

obtained by the candidates.

For the better understanding of this judgment, I find it necessary to reproduce

the said letter, which reads as follows:

The above letter of correction issued by the Commissioner of Examinations

shows that no sooner the relevant discrepancy as to the names been

discovered, it had been corrected so that no one would be prejudiced by the

said mistake.

When this Court granted Leave to Proceed in relation to this application, the

Court ordered the Registrar of the Court to hold in his safe custody, the

originals of the answer scripts relating to index No. 0356 and 0357, which

was made available to the Court by the learned DSG, when this matter was

supported for Leave to Proceed for the inspection of the Court.

In the process of writing this judgment, I had the opportunity of perusing the

originals of the two answer scripts, as well as the mark sheets prepared by

the examiners who gave the relevant marks.

Page 23 of 26

It is clear from the said mark sheets that the answers had been scrutinized

and marks had been given by one examiner designated as ,

while the said marks had been re-checked by another officer designated as

. Both of them have been identified by using a code number

to maintain the credibility of the examination. The above two officers had been

functioning under the supervision of yet another officer who has been

identified as who has supervised and signed the said mark sheets.

The above-mentioned procedure as to the marking of the examination papers

establishes the fact that there had been no procedural lapses as to the

marking and supervision of the examination papers as claimed by the

petitioners.

Having examined the originals of the two answer scripts and mark sheets, it

is abundantly clear to me that the candidate who sat under the index No.

0356 had obtained 77 marks, while the candidate who sat under the index

No. 0357 has obtained 54 marks. The complete result sheet in relation to all

the candidates who sat for the said competitive exam tendered to Court by

the Commissioner of Examinations, along with the two original answer sheets,

clearly establish the fact that no mix-up has occurred as to the index numbers

of the two candidates considered, other than in their name initials in the

individual result sheets which were originally issued to them.

With the necessary correction in relation to the names, it has been established

that only the candidate who obtained more than the minimum pass mark

under index No. 0356, namely, G.D.C.D. Kumara of Prison Lockup,

Balapitiya, had been promoted.

It is obvious that the marks obtained by the petitioners who sat for the exam

were below the required minimum mark and they would not have been

qualified to be promoted accordingly.

Having considered the above factual matrix, now the question before me is

whether the petitioners can claim that their fundamental rights have been

infringed due to a mistake that took place, which has later been corrected.

I find that the petitioners would not be in a position under any manner to

claim that their legitimate expectations of being promoted to the next rank

had been violated by the respondents due to a correction of an obvious

mistake occasioned due to an administrative blunder. It has been the 28th

respondent who would have suffered as a result of the mentioned

administrative error of stating the initials of his name wrongly in the result

sheet despite having the pass mark, if the said mistake was not corrected.

The petitioners would not have suffered due to the said error as they have

failed to obtain the minimum pass mark.

When considering both the aspects together, it is clear that the petitioners

cannot claim that they had any legitimate expectations of being promoted

after failing to secure the minimum marks required. They cannot have any

expectations based on the wrongly mentioned name of the 28th respondent.

The petitioners cannot claim equality by comparing them with someone who

was wrongly disadvantaged due to an administrative error, but later rightfully

corrected.

In the case of Ginigathgala Mohandiramlage Nimalsiri Vs. Cornel P.P.J.

Fernando, SCFR 256/2010 SC minutes of 17th September 2015, it was

observed;

In order to seek redress under the doctrine of legitimate expectation the

person must prove he had a legitimate expectation which was based on

a promise or an established practice. Thus, the applicability of the said

doctrine is based on the facts and circumstances of each case.

Considering the doctrine of legitimate expectation, it was observed in SCFR

66/2019 decided on 29-11-2024;

Considering the framework of Article 12(1) of the Constitution which

guarantees the right to equality, and the applicability of the principle of

legitimate expectation it becomes clear that the expectation in question

Page 25 of 26

must be based on a promise or commitment made by the relevant

authority.

In the case of Elmore Perera Vs. Major Montague Jayawickrama, Minister

of Public Administration and Plantation Industries and Others (1985)

1SLR 285, it was held;

Any person setting up grievances of denial of equal treatment must

establish that between persons similarly circumstanced some were

treated to their prejudice and the differential treatment had no

reasonable relevance to the object sought to be achieved. Before a person

can claim to be discriminated against another, he must show that the

other person was similarly situated or equally circumstanced. He must

make out that not only he had been treated differently from others, but

he had been so treated from persons similarly placed without any

reasonable basis and such differential treatment is unjustifiably made.

In the present case, the Department of Prisons had used the procedure of

conducting a written examination through the Department of Examinations

in order to select those who are entitled to be promoted based on the marks

obtained by each of the candidates who sat for the exam.

This has been the procedure adopted by the Department of Prisons and there

is no evidence to suggest that the respondents had deviated from the said

procedure when determining the successful candidates who stand promoted.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that there is no basis

for the petitioners as well as the added respondents to succeed in relation to

their applications on the basis that the fundamental rights guaranteed to

them in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution had been infringed.

Accordingly, I hold that there had been no violation of the fundamental rights

of the petitioners and, hence, the application is dismissed for want of any

merit.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to return the originals of the answer

scripts and the mark sheets tendered to the Court in relation to the

candidates who sat for the examination under the index No. 0356 and 0357

to the Hon. Attorney General so that the same can be returned to the proper

authority.

The parties shall bear their own costs.
