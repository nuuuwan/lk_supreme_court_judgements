"The 2nd appellant has given evidence and she had said that she is rejecting the"
"contract entered in to with the respondent for the reason that the respondent"
"had failed to honour the same regarding the quality of the building. She further"
"had stated that, upon signing the agreement, they looked into the construction"
"of the house and found that not even a plan or C.O.C had been submitted by"
"the respondent for construction."
"She had also said that at page 196 that because they could not get the"
"apartment completed and the fact that they were denied the opportunity of"
"buying another house at more favourable rates, the loss they had incurred"
"monetarily and financially, had been estimated at 3 million rupees and the"
"initial amount of Rs. 4 million with the addition of legal interest at the rate of"
"24% from 2010 April."
"The respondent also had given evidence and had claimed that the appellants"
"failed to pay the monthly installments and that the mother of the 2nd appellant"
"had asked for brokers fees and that was one of the reasons for the"
"discontinuation of the financial transaction. The mother of the 2nd appellant"
"vehemently denied the accusations alleged by the respondent with regards to"
"her asking for broker fees."
"The respondent has also admitted that he had failed to register the agreement"
"entered between the parties."
"Upon the conclusion of the leading of evidence, the learned High Court Judge"
"had evaluated evidence quite clearly and methodically and has concluded that"
"due to the violation of the agreement, the appellants are entitled for the initial"
"payment of Rs. 4 million but as requested they are not entitled for the damages"
"and the legal interest because they have not proved before Court the loss"
"incurred financially and mentally."
"But upon perusal of the evidence, as pointed out above at pages 171 and 196,"
"both the witnesses had referred to the loss incurred and they have been cross-"
"examined also on the same."
"At this point, I wish to draw my attention to the case of I. M. D. Bandara vs"
"The Director of Health and others, SC Appeal 69/2016 by Aluvihare, J,"
"where he has stated that,"
