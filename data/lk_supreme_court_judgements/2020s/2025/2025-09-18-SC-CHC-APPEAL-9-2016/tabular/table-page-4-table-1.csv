"The appellants filed action in the CHC to recover a sum of Rs. 4 million with"
"interest calculated at the rate of 24% per annum from 01.04.2010 and"
"damages of Rs. 3 million."
"The defendants had agreed to build two houses at the price of 21,000,000 and"
"the appellants were to pay as a deposit a sum of Rs. 4,000,000 and had agreed"
"to pay the balance in installments over a period of 10 years."
"Thereafter, the parties had entered into an agreement which had been marked"
"as “P1” but the appellants complained that the said agreement dated 5th March"
"2010, had been breached by the defendant in which the construction of the"
"house was not completed as agreed upon and had also failed to carry out the"
"construction to the proper standard."
"The agreement goes onto state that in the situation the vendor fails to honour"
"the agreement, the purchaser has a right to claim damages amounting to Rs. 1"
"million. It further iterates that if the purchaser fails to make the balance"
"payments, the vendor is able to deduct Rs. 1 million from the advance payment"
"and pay the balance alongside the monthly payments made."
"The learned judge of the CHC had held with the appellants and had decreed to"
"the appellants to be paid by the defendant Rs. 4 million on the basis that the"
"defendant had breached performance of his duties under the agreement"
"without the addition of legal interest to the aforementioned amount and has"
"not awarded the damages because he has concluded that the plaintiffs had"
"failed to prove that they were entitled for the same."
"The instant appeal has been filed by the appellants seeking the setting aside of"
"the said judgment and had prayed for both damages and interest on the"
"decreed amount."
"Upon perusal of the evidence led in the CHC, the mother of the 2nd appellant"
"had said that the agreements were drawn on behalf of her daughter and the"
"son-in-law. She had gone on to state that although the initial payment was"
"paid by them, they did not pay the rest of the installments as they had initially"
"paid the advance for two houses and had later reconsidered and had agreed to"
"buy only one house because there were many delays from the respondent’s"
"end. (171)"
"The 2nd appellant has taken steps to complain against the respondent to the"
"police and action has been filed in the Magistrates Court."
