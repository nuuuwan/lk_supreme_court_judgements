"considerations before the judge, bestows upon the judge, a discretion in"
"the matter‚Äù."
"Therefore, the learned judge of the CHC had the opportunity of hearing the"
"evidence led at the inquiry. Hence, it is my opinion that the legislators when"
"drafting the above section had thought it fit to leave the discretion in the hands"
"of the inquiring judge to decide on the entitlement of the legal interest, which"
"in my opinion has to be left at that in this instance too."
"The submission of the learned Counsel for the respondent was that, following"
"the delivery of the judgment by the learned judge of the CHC, the respondent"
"was ready to comply with the payment of the decreed amount being Rs. 4"
"million but that the appellants instead of collecting that amount, had filed the"
"instant appeal."
"As such, he submitted that it would be unjustifiable for the appellants to seek"
"interest on that amount."
"Hence, the instant appeal is hereby dismissed, the respondent is directed to"
"pay the decreed amount of Rs. 4 million to the appellants."
