"SC/Appeal No. 162/2014"
"Nowhere in the High Court Judgment, is it revealed which case has been filed before. The case"
"number or the nature of the case or any documentary evidence placed in this regard before the"
"learned High Court Judges or the number given to the relevant issue raised at the trial is not"
"mentioned. It must be noted, among the 28 issues that has been raised, there is not a single"
"issue raised based on Res Judicata.  Thus, the learned High Court Judges have gone beyond the"
"scope of the case presented at the trial before the learned District Judge. On the other hand, the"
"learned District Judge has considered the effect of the Partition Decree marked 2V1. 2V4 is an"
"Amended Decree between the 2nd Defendant and one K. Kusumawathie who is not a party to"
"this action, and as per the evidence at the trial, it was an action to evict the person who occupied"
"the 2nd Defendant’s house. 2V7 is an order of a Primary Court in a Section 66 application No."
"71134/E between the 2nd Defendant and the 1st Plaintiff’s predecessor, which is a temporary"
"order till relief is sought and granted from a proper forum. None of these can establish that the"
"matter  had  been  decided  between  Parties  previously.  It  appears  that  the  Plaintiffs,  in  their"
"amended Plaint, have referred to one case No. 4063 L filed before the same District Court, but"
"no document relating to that case has been produced in evidence to prove that the cause of"
"action has become Res Judicata between Parties. This error seems to be the main reason to set"
"aside the District Court Judgment which was in favour of the 2nd Defendant."
