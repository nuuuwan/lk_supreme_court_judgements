"","It  is  answered  that  the  High  Court  failed  to  apply  it  correctly,  though  there  is  a"
"","reference to that principle."
"(c)","Did the High Court err in holding (at p.10 in “B”) as follows: “It is also to be noted"
"","that earlier there had been a case between the 1st (Plaintiff) Appellant’s father (the"
"","2nd Plaintiff) and the 2nd (Defendant) Respondent with regard to the same corpus."
"","Therefore the 2nd (Defendant) Respondent has no right to claim the same corpus"
"","that has been adjudicated earlier in another case which is Res Judicata.”?"
