Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action on 10.08.1992 in the District Court of Matale

against the defendant seeking a declaration of title to the land described

in schedule A to the plaint, the ejectment of the defendant from the land

described in schedule B to the plaint (which is a portion of the land

described in schedule A), and damages. The 2nd and 3rd defendants, who

are children of the 1st defendant, were later added as parties. The

defendant sought dismissal of the plaintiffs action. After trial, the District

Court dismissed the plaintiffs action on the ground that the plaintiff

lacked the requisite title to institute the action against the defendant, as

his title Deed marked P1 was a conditional transfer. It was also held that

the defendant had prescribed to the land. On appeal, the High Court of

Civil Appeal of Kandy set aside the judgment of the District Court on both

grounds. This Court granted leave to appeal to the defendant on the

following question of law:

Did the High Court err in law by failing to appreciate that the plaintiff

did not get title to the land, as the condition appended to the

operative part of Deed P1 was not fulfilled by the vendor?

By Deed P1, executed on 05.10.1988, the vendor transferred the land to

the plaintiff for valuable consideration. At the time of this transfer, the

3

SC/APPEAL/66/2022

defendant was already in possession of the land. Prior to the transfer, on

06.11.1984, the vendor had instituted Case No. 3383/L against the

defendant, seeking a declaration of title and ejectment. Accordingly, Deed

P1 was executed, as stated therein, Subject however to the condition that

I the said vendor should prosecute the action filed for the ejectment of one

Kumarasinghe (the defendant in the instant case) from the said premises

and obtain vacant possession. At the trial in Case No. 3383/L, the

defendant raised an issue contending that the vendor could not maintain

that action against him, as she had already transferred the land to the

plaintiff by Deed P1. The vendor withdrew the action on 17.01.1992, with

liberty to file an action against the defendant by the new owner (the

present plaintiff), if necessary. The defendants counsel did not object to

the withdrawal of that action, subject to that condition. A certified copy

of Case No. 3383/L was marked at the trial as P5.

Drawing attention to the above-quoted part of Deed P1, the argument

advanced before this Court by the defendant is that Deed P1 is a

conditional transfer and, as the condition was not fulfilled by the vendor,

title did not pass to the vendee (the plaintiff in this action), thereby

rendering the plaintiff incapable of instituting this action against the

defendant. According to this argument, title still remains with the vendor.

However, in the previous case, the argument of the defendant was that

title had passed to the vendee upon the execution of Deed P1. This

inconsistent stance amounts to an attempt to approbate and reprobate,

a practice that should not be countenanced by the apex Court.

The part quoted from the Deed does not make it a conditional transfer.

The vendor has thereby only reiterated her common law obligation to

warrant and defend the title in express terms. Upon the execution of a

Deed of Transfer of immovable property in accordance with the law, title

vests in the vendee, irrespective of whether possession is physically

4

SC/APPEAL/66/2022

delivered. Consequently, the vendee inter alia acquires the right to

institute legal proceedings for the ejectment of any party in possession of

the land who lacks a lawful entitlement to remain. In this whole process,

it is the duty of the vendor to warrant and defend the title of the vendee.

If the vendor fails to discharge this duty when he is called upon to do so,

the vendee can sue the vendor for damages.

Walter Pereira in his monumental work, The Laws of Ceylon, 2nd Edition

(1913), at page 651 states A vendor is bound to warrant his title, although

he has given no express covenant for that purpose. The learned author

further states at page 652 that there is under the Roman-Dutch Law,

implied in every contract of sale a warranty by the vendor that the

purchaser shall have the absolute and dominant enjoyment of the goods.

In Chellappah v. Mcheyzer (1937) 38 NLR 393, Soertsz J. reaffirmed this

principle, stating at page 396: Whereas in every contract of sale, other

than one in which the vendor definitely states that he will not warrant and

defend title, there is implied, if it is not expressed, an undertaking to

warrant and defend title if and when it is challenged.

In Appuhamy v. Appuhamy (1880) 3 SCC 61 the Full Bench of the

Supreme Court presided over by Cayley C.J. held:

The execution and delivery of a conveyance of land, the property of

the vendor, if in conformity with the Ordinance of frauds, transferred

the title to the land to the purchaser, although no corporeal delivery

or actual possession of the land had followed. And that by virtue

merely of the title so created, the purchaser might maintain an action

seeking for a declaration of title against a third party in possession

without title or under a weaker title.

In Punchi Hamy v. Arnolis (1883) 3 SCC 61 the Full Bench of the Supreme

Court presided over by Burnside C.J. held:

5

SC/APPEAL/66/2022

A purchaser of land who has a conveyance from his vendor, but has

never had any possession, may maintain an action to eject from the

land a third party claiming title adversely to the vendor.

This principle has been applied in Latheef v. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333

wherein Marsoof J. held at 352:

The action from which this appeal arises is not one falling within

these special categories, as admittedly, the Respondents had

absolutely no contractual nexus with the Appellants, nor had they

at any time enjoyed possession of the land in question. Of course,

this is not a circumstance that would deprive the Respondents to this

appeal from the right to maintain a vindicatory action, as it is trite

law in this country since the decisions of the Supreme Court in

Punchi Hamy v. Arnolis (1883) 5 SCC 160 and Allis Appu v. Edris

Hamy (1894) 3 SCR 87 that even an owner with no more than bare

paper title (nuda proprietas) who has never enjoyed possession

could lawfully vindicate his property subject to any lawful defence

such as prescription.

In Andris v. Siman (1889) 9 SCC 7 it was observed that, in an action rei

vindicatio, if the plaintiff seeks ejectment of the defendant on paper title,

title lies in deed only, and possession is not necessary to perfect it.

Burnside C.J. held if the plaintiff having failed to prove possession and

ouster, had relied on his paper title only to entitle him to possession, then

the question to be determined would have been whether the plaintiff had

succeeded in establishing a good paper title to the land as against the

defendants, whose actual possession was sufficient until the plaintiff had

proved good title.

As held by Wigneswaran J. in Luwis Singho and Others v. Ponnamperuma

[1996] 2 Sri LR 320 at 324-325:

6

SC/APPEAL/66/2022

But in a rei vindicatio action, the cause of action is based on the sole

ground of violation of the right of ownership. In such an action proof

is required that;

(i) the Plaintiff is the owner of the land in question i.e. he has

the dominium and,

(ii) that the land is in the possession of the Defendant (Voet

6:1:34)

Thus even if an owner never had possession of a land in question it

would not be a bar to a vindicatory action.

The principle that the delivery of possession is not an indispensable

requirement to pass title to the vendee was affirmed in a recent judgment

of mine in Harison Pinto v. Piyaseeli Fernando (SC/APPEAL/57/2016, SC

Minutes of 11.09.2023):

It is true that it is the duty of the vendor to deliver possession of the

property to the vendee at the time of the sale, and warrant and

defend the title when a third party challenges the title of the vendee.

However, merely because the vendor does not deliver possession of

the property to the vendee at the time of the sale, the sale does not

become ineffective or unenforceable against third parties, nor does

the vendee become a speculative buyer. The vendee can either sue

the vendor seeking rescission of the sale and a refund of the

purchase price together with damages or sue the trespassers for a

declaration of title and ejectment, and defend his title with the

assistance of the vendor.

The cases cited on behalf of the defendant were cases where the dispute

had arisen between the vendor and the vendee, and are therefore not very

helpful to decide the case at hand. The defendant heavily relies on

Ratwatte v. Dullewe (1907) 10 NLR 304 in support of his case. As seen

7

SC/APPEAL/66/2022

from page 309 of the judgment, The facts in the case are that the plaintiff

bought the property at a public auction on conditions of sale by which on

the payment of the purchase money the defendant agreed to execute a

conveyance, and that on payment of the full purchase money the

purchaser should enter into possession of the property. On the same page

Middleton J. stated: I have no doubt therefore that if the plaintiff here and

accepted the conveyance tendered by the defendant, he might maintain his

action against Dullewe (the third party in possession) for declaration of

title, and might have called upon his vendor to warrant and defend the title

conferred. In fact, I think it would be his proper and only remedy; but here

the purchaser has not accepted the conveyance. In Ratwattes case too,

the dispute was between the vendor and the vendee, rather than between

the vendee and a third party, as in the present case. The above quotation

makes it clear that it was at least an implied condition of that sale that

on payment of the full purchase money, the purchaser should enter into

possession of the property. Since a third party was in possession, the

purchaser has not accepted the conveyance.

However, no such situation arises in the present case. The plaintiff paid

the full purchase price to the vendor and he accepted the Deed, knowing

very well that the defendant was in unlawful possession of the land. The

plaintiff also knew that a case had already been filed by the vendor to

eject the defendant, as stated in the Deed itself. Therefore, the facts in

Ratwattes case and the present case are not comparable,

notwithstanding that the views expressed by Hutchinson C.J. were

highlighted in support of the defendants argument.

As I observed in Kumara v. Kanthi [2021] 1 Sri LR 398 at 403 A principle

laid down in a case shall be understood in the context of the peculiar facts

and circumstances of that particular case. Such principles have no

universal application unless the facts and circumstances are on all fours.

8

SC/APPEAL/66/2022

Cases must be decided based on the unique facts and circumstances of

each case.

The facts in Balasuriya v. Appuhami (1914) 17 NLR 404 are similar to

those in the instant case. In Balasuriyas case, the defendants sold the

land by a Deed wherein they expressly undertook to warrant and defend

the title conveyed to the plaintiff. Admittedly, the defendant vendors

failed to put the plaintiff in physical possession of the land, and the

plaintiff was resisted by certain individuals in his attempt to take

possession. As a result, the plaintiff instituted an action against those

individuals, calling upon the vendors to warrant and defend his title

against the defendants in that case. The vendors failed to do so,

prompting the plaintiff to file an action for the recovery of the loss

incurred due to the vendors failure to warrant and defend his title to the

land. One of the defences raised by the vendors was that the plaintiff

should have sued them in the first instance, rather than incurring the

expense of suing the alleged trespassers. This Court held that:

It is competent to a purchaser of land, although he has not been

placed in possession of the land sold by the vendor, to sue a

trespasser in ejectment calling upon the vendor to warrant and

defend title, and if defeated in the action, to sue the vendor for

damage.

Walter Pereira J., one of the most erudite and eminent judges of that

time, with the concurrence of Lascelles C.J., explained the law at page

405 and cited Ratwatte v. Dullewe in support of the above conclusion:

As I have endeavoured to explain in my judgment in the case of

Fernando v. Perera (1914) 17 NLR 161 under our law the contract of

sale of land is complete on the execution of a notarial conveyance

followed by the delivery of the conveyance by the vendor to the

9

SC/APPEAL/66/2022

purchaser, and it is now well-settled law (see Appuhamy v.

Appuhamy 3 S.C.C. 61) that it is not necessary that the purchaser

should be placed in physical possession of the land sold to enable

him to sue a third party in ejectment. That being so, it was quite

competent to the plaintiff in the present case to sue, as he did, the

defendants in case No. 10,310, and call upon the present

defendants (vendors) to warrant and defend his title. In some of the

cases cited there are no doubt dicta showing that in a case like the

present the vendee might, in the first instance, sue the vendor,

requiring him to give him physical possession of the land sold, but

there is nothing in those cases to show that that is the vendees only

remedy, or that the vendee might not sue the so-called trespasser in

ejectment calling upon the vendor to warrant and defend his title,

and that, having failed in the action, he might not sue the vendor for

the loss sustained by him. On the other hand, in the case of Ratwatte

v. Dullewe (1907) 10 NLR 304 Middleton J, says: I have no doubt

that if the plaintiff had accepted the conveyance tendered by the

defendant he might maintain his action against Dullewe (that is, the

alleged trespasser) for declaration of title, and might have called

upon his vendor to warrant and defend the title conferred. That is

exactly what, in effect, happened in the present case, and I have no

hesitation in saying that the plaintiffs claim is well founded.

I am in respectful agreement with the above dicta of Walter Pereira J. and

have nothing more to add.

I answer the question of law on which leave to appeal was granted in the

negative. The judgment of the High Court dated 27.06.2019 is affirmed

and the appeal is dismissed. The plaintiff is entitled to costs in all three

Courts.
