"should have sued them in the first instance, rather than incurring the"
"expense of suing the alleged trespassers. This Court held that:"
"It  is  competent  to  a  purchaser  of  land,  although  he  has  not  been"
"placed  in  possession  of  the  land  sold  by  the  vendor,  to  sue  a"
"trespasser  in  ejectment  calling  upon  the  vendor  to  warrant  and"
"defend  title,  and  if  defeated  in  the  action,  to  sue  the  vendor  for"
"damage."
