"defendant was already in possession of the land. Prior to the transfer, on"
"06.11.1984,  the  vendor  had  instituted  Case  No.  3383/L  against  the"
"defendant, seeking a declaration of title and ejectment. Accordingly, Deed"
"P1 was executed, as stated therein, “Subject however to the condition that"
"I the said vendor should prosecute the action filed for the ejectment of one"
"Kumarasinghe (the defendant in the instant case) from the said premises"
"and  obtain  vacant  possession.”  At  the  trial  in  Case  No.  3383/L,  the"
"defendant raised an issue contending that the vendor could not maintain"
"that action against him, as she had already transferred the land to the"
"plaintiff by Deed P1. The vendor withdrew the action on 17.01.1992, with"
"liberty  to  file  an  action  against  the  defendant  by  the  new  owner  (the"
"present plaintiff), if necessary. The defendant’s counsel did not object to"
"the withdrawal of that action, subject to that condition. A certified copy"
"of Case No. 3383/L was marked at the trial as P5."
"Drawing  attention  to  the  above-quoted  part  of  Deed  P1,  the  argument"
"advanced  before  this  Court  by  the  defendant  is  that  Deed  P1  is  a"
"conditional transfer and, as the condition was not fulfilled by the vendor,"
"title  did  not  pass  to  the  vendee  (the  plaintiff  in  this  action),  thereby"
"rendering  the  plaintiff  incapable  of  instituting  this  action  against  the"
"defendant. According to this argument, title still remains with the vendor."
"However, in the previous case, the argument of the defendant was that"
"title  had  passed  to  the  vendee  upon  the  execution  of  Deed  P1.  This"
"inconsistent stance amounts to an attempt to approbate and reprobate,"
"a practice that should not be countenanced by the apex Court."
"The part quoted from the Deed does not make it a conditional transfer."
"The  vendor  has  thereby  only  reiterated  her  common  law  obligation  to"
"warrant and defend the title in express terms. Upon the execution of a"
"Deed of Transfer of immovable property in accordance with the law, title"
"vests  in  the  vendee,  irrespective  of  whether  possession  is  physically"
