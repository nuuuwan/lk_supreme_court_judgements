"Cases must be decided based on the unique facts and circumstances of"
"each case."
"The  facts  in  Balasuriya  v.  Appuhami  (1914)  17  NLR  404  are  similar  to"
"those in the instant case. In Balasuriya’s case, the defendants sold the"
"land by a Deed wherein they expressly undertook to warrant and defend"
"the  title  conveyed  to  the  plaintiff.  Admittedly,  the  defendant  vendors"
"failed  to  put  the  plaintiff  in  physical  possession  of  the  land,  and  the"
"plaintiff  was  resisted  by  certain 
individuals 
in  his  attempt  to  take"
"possession.  As  a  result,  the  plaintiff  instituted  an  action  against  those"
"individuals,  calling  upon  the  vendors  to  warrant  and  defend  his  title"
"against  the  defendants 
in  that  case.  The  vendors 
failed  to  do  so,"
"prompting  the  plaintiff  to  file  an  action  for  the  recovery  of  the  loss"
"incurred due to the vendors’ failure to warrant and defend his title to the"
"land.  One  of  the  defences  raised  by  the  vendors  was  that  the  plaintiff"
"should have sued them in the first instance, rather than incurring the"
"expense of suing the alleged trespassers. This Court held that:"
