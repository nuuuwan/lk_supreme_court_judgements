"compelled to take action against the Respondent unless the transaction is concluded by"
"17.06.1977."
"In my view, the most crucial item of evidence in this appeal is the letter dated 28.06.1977"
"(P2) sent by the Respondent to the Appellant in response to letter dated 08.06.1977 (P15)."
"There the Respondent states that because of various disputes, even the bank wanted to"
"cancel the loan and the Respondent had with the greatest difficulty kept the loan going"
"with the bank. He goes on to state that he will now make arrangements to finalise the"
"matter by making the extra payment called by the bank and also the extra payment the"
"Respondent amicably promised to pay to the Appellant. He further goes on to state that"
"the matter could be finalized only by the end of July 1977 as he has to make the necessary"
"arrangements."
"Even assuming that there was a prior waiver or release by the Appellant, it was possible"
"for him to make time of the essence again of the agreement between the parties. In W.J."
"Alan Ltd. [supra. at 140] Lord Denning held that it is possible for a person who has waived"
"his right to timely performance to be able to revert to his strict legal rights for the future"
"by giving reasonable notice in that behalf, or otherwise making it plain by his conduct that"
"he will thereafter insist on them."
"P15 in my view is due notice given to the Respondent of the intention of the Appellant to"
"consider the extended time of performance as being of essence of P1 notwithstanding"
"any  extension.  We  have  before  us  a  situation  where  time  was  of  essence  at  the  time"
"parties  entered  into  the  agreement.  This  time  of  performance  was  extended  by  P15."
"Hence  the  question  arises  as  to  whether  the  Appellant  can  once  again  make  time  the"
"essence of P1 by giving such notice."
"The converse position was considered in Microutsicos v. Swart [(1949) 3 SALR 715] where"
"the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa considered the question as to"
"when delay on the part of a buyer in making provision for payment of the purchase price"
