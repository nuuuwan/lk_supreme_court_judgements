"before the expiry of the stipulated time as extended?"
"(6) If so, can the plaintiff derive any benefit by the fact that the prices have escalated?"
"The  first  two  questions  of  law  were  raised  by  the  Appellant  and  the  others  by  the"
"Respondent."
"Time of Performance"
"Parties admitted the execution of the agreement to sell No. 431 (P1). According to P1, it"
"was agreed that the Appellant should sell transfer and convey and the Respondent should"
"purchase the premises for the sum of Rupees Forty-Five Thousand ( Rs. 45,000/=) free"
"from all encumbrances within three months from the date thereof."
"P1  was  executed  on  14.02.1975.  Hence,  the  parties  should  have  performed  their"
"respective obligations by 14.05.1975."
"The case of the Appellant is that since the Respondent failed to perform his part of the"
"bargain by the time specified for performance, the Appellant was entitled to rescind from"
"the agreement and the Respondent became liable to handover the premises."
"The  governing  law  of  P1  is  Roman-Dutch  law.  Where  any  party  to  a  contract  fails  to"
"perform his part of the bargain within the time fixed for performance, he is said to be in"
"default or mora."
"Mora can be either mora ex re or mora ex persona."
"Mora ex re arises where time for performance has been fixed in the contract and one party"
"fails to perform within the specified time. As Voet [22.1.26] succinctly explains, it is not"
"only men who make demands, but the law or even the date demands instead of a man,"
"provided only that a fixed date was made a term in the obligation."
