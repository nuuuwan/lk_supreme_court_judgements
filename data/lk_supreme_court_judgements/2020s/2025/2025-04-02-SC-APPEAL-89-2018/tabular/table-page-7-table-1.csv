"particular contract is whether the parties have expressly made it so. By that I do"
"not mean that it is essential to use the very words ""time is of the essence"" in the"
"contract,  but  it  should  appear  from  the  expressed  terms  and  the  surrounding"
"circumstances taken as a whole that time is of the essence of the contract. It is"
"therefore primarily a matter of interpretation of the contract. If the answer to the"
"question whether time is of the essence is in the affirmative then the defaulter"
"cannot enforce performance by the other party.‚Äù (emphasis added)"
