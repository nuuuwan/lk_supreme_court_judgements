"on to provide the reference numbers of the bank and corporation should the Appellant"
"wish to verify this information."
"In  response  to  P8,  the  Appellant  sent  letter  dated  24.08.1976  (P9).  He  states  that  the"
"Respondent failed to purchase the premises within three months as required by P1 and"
"reiterates the contents of P4 where by the Respondent was requested to return the title"
"deeds to the premises immediately. The Appellant goes on to specifically state that he is"
"not obliged to sell the premises to the Respondent."
"In my view, the communication up to this point  of time does not establish that there has"
"been any waiver or release of the obligation on the part of the Respondent to perform his"
"obligation on time. On the contrary, it clearly shows that the Appellant has taken up the"

"contents of P7 and P9 and affirms the stand taken earlier that he is not obliged to sell the"
"premises  to  the  Respondent.  The  Appellant  once  again  calls  upon  the  Respondent  to"
"return the title deeds relating to the property without further delay."
"The Respondent placed much reliance on the notification given by P10 calling upon the"
"Appellant  to  come  to  the  bank  to  sign  the  deed  of  transfer  to  establish  that  the"
"Respondent  made  tender  of  performance  which  was  rejected  by  the  Appellant.  This"
"contention is untenable for the reasons set out above. The Appellant had by then clearly"
