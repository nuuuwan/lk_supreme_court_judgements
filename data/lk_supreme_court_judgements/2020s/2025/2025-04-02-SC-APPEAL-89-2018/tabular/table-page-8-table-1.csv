"(i.e.  14.05.1975),  requested  the  Respondent  to  return  the  title  deeds  relating  to  the"
"transaction.  This  clearly  is  an  indication  that  the  Appellant  considered  time  to  be  of"
"essence of P1."
"The understanding of the Respondent appears to be the same. In letter dated 14.01.1976"
"(P6),  the  Respondent  apologizes  to  the  Appellant  and  asks  him  to  accept  his  delay  in"
"expediting the issue."
"I therefore conclude that time is of essence of the agreement (P1) between the parties."
"Both the Appellant and Respondent should have performed their respective obligations"
"by 14.05.1975."
"Extension of Time"
"The Respondent claims that this time was extended until 31.07.1997 and relies on a letter"
"dated 08.06.1977 (P15) sent to him by Mr. S. Gnanapandithan, Attorney-at-Law for the"
"Appellant."
"On  the  contrary,  the  Appellant  submitted  that  he  sued  on  P2  and  not  on  any  other"
"agreement. It was contended that although the Appellant had stated in the plaint that the"
"Respondent was granted an extension of time until 31.07.1977, the Appellant had at the"
"trial confined himself to the time specified in P1 and hence the statement in the plaint on"
"the extension of time until 31.07.1977 recedes to the background. The Appellant relied"
"on the decision in Hanaffi v. Nallamma [(1998) 1 SLR 73]."
"The  Appellant  further  submitted  that  evidence  on  the  purported  extension  of  time  is"
"inadmissible in view of Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"Moreover, the Appellant submitted that the communication relied on by the Respondent"
"to establish the extension of time has been sent marked “Without Prejudice” and hence"
"inadmissible in view of Section 23 of the Evidence Ordinance."
