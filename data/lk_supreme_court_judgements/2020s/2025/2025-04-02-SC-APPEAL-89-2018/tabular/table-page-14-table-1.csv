"of the exceptions are:"
"1)  When the issue is whether “without prejudice” communications have resulted"
"in a compromise agreement being reached."
"2)  when the issue is whether the agreement apparently concluded as a result of"
"the  “without  prejudice”  negations  should  be  set  aside  on  the  ground  of"
"misrepresentation, fraud or undue influence."
"3)  when  the  issue  is  whether  an  estoppel  has  arisen  due  to  a  clear  statement"
"which was made by one party to the ‘without prejudice’ negotiations and on"
"which the other party is intended to rely or act, and does in fact rely or act, to"
"their detriment (even where no concluded settlement arises)."
"4)  a  party  may  be  allowed  to  give  evidence  of  what  the  other  said  or  wrote  in"
"‘without prejudice’ negotiations if the ‘without prejudice’ rule which excludes"
"said evidence would act as a cloak for perjury, blackmail or other “unambiguous"
"impropriety” – in the clearest cases of abuse of the privilege."
"5)  evidence of negotiations may be given in order to  explain delay or apparent"
"acquiescence."
