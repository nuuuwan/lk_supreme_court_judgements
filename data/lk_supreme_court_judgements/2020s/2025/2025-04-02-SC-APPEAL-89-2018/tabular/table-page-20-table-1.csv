"he made a promise not to insist on his strict legal rights. That promise was intended"
"to  be  binding,  intended  to  be  acted  on,  and  was  in  fact  acted  on.  He  cannot"
"afterwards go back on it.”"
"In Furst (Enrico) & Co. [supra. at 349] Lord Diplock held that:"
"“Waiver does not vary the terms of the contract…Waiver is conduct on the part of"
"a party to a contract which affects his remedies for a breach of contract by the other"

"Again  in  W.J.  Alan  Ltd.  [supra.  at  140]  Lord  Denning  went  on  to  give  a  more  detailed"
"exposition of the principle as follows:"

"first party will not afterwards be allowed to insist on the strict legal eights when it"
"would be inequitable for him to do so…There may be no consideration moving from"
"him who benefits from the waiver. There may be no detriment to him by acting on"
"it.  There  may  be  nothing  in  writing.  Nevertheless,  the  one  who  waives  his  strict"
"rights cannot afterwards insist on them. His strict rights are at any rate suspended"
"so long as the waiver lasts. He may on occasion be able to revert to his strict legal"
"rights for the future by giving reasonable notice in that behalf, or otherwise making"

"He will not be allowed to revert to his strict legal rights. He can only enforce them"
"subject to the waiver he has made.”"
"I  have  no  doubt  that  these  authorities  correctly  set  out  the  position  in  English  law."
