"Law, does not regard the mere fact that the debtor makes default on the stipulated date,"
"if there is one, as sufficient for this purpose. Fagan, A. J. A. held (at page 715) that:"
"""where a time for the performance of a vital term in a contract has been stipulated"
"for and one party is in mora by reason of his failure to perform it within that time,"
"but “time is not of the essence of the contract”, the other party can make it so by"
"giving notice that if the obligation is not complied with by a certain date, allowing"
"a reasonable time, he will regard the contract as at an end.”"
