"Proctor and Gamble Co. (supra. at 2442D), Muller v. Linsley and Mortimer [1996] PNLR"
"74 at 77]. As Lord Hope held in Ofulue v. Bossart [(2009) UKHL 16, p. 12]:"
"“The essence of the rule lies in the nature of the protection that is given to parties"
"when they are attempting to negotiate a compromise. It is the ability to speak freely"
"that indicates where the limits of the rule should lie. Far from being mechanistic,"
"the rule is generous in its application. It recognises that unseen dangers may lurk"
"behind things said or written during this period, and it removes the inhibiting effect"
"that this may have in the interests of promoting attempts to achieve a settlement.”"
