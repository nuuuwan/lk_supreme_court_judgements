Written Submissions:

01.03.2017, 03.08.2018 and 21.06.2023 by the Substituted Defendant Respondent Respondent.

Argued on: 01.06.2023 Decided on: 02.04.2025 Janak De Silva, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant (Appellant) instituted this action against the Defendant-

Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) seeking a judgment for ejecting the Respondent,

his servants and agents and all those holding under him from the premises more fully

described in the schedule to the plaint (premises).

According to the Appellant, he had permitted the Respondent to reside at the premises

from 06.11.1974. The parties had thereafter entered into an agreement by deed No. 431

dated 14.02.1975 attested by S. Gnanapandithen N.P. whereby the Respondent undertook

to purchase the premises for a total consideration of Rs. 45,000/= within three (3) months

from the date of execution of the said deed.

The Appellant had at the request of the Respondent granted the Respondent extensions

of time to purchase the said premises. Finally, the Respondent was given time until

31.07.1977 to purchase the premises. Since the Respondent failed to do so, he became

liable to hand over vacant possession. As he failed to do so, this action was instituted to

evict him from the premises and to claim damages.

The Respondent denied the claim of the Appellant and contended that he was, at all times

material to this action, willing to purchase the premises. However, the Appellant had failed

and neglected to execute the deed of transfer for the premises in favour of the

01.03.2017, 02.07.2018 and 28.08.2023 by Plaintiff Appellant Petitioner.

Page 4 of 28

Respondent. Accordingly, the Respondent made a cross claim for specific performance of

the agreement between him and the Appellant.

Upon the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional District Judge delivered judgment

dismissing the action of the Appellant and granting the Respondent specific performance

as prayed for in the answer.

The learned trial judge concluded that the time of performance was extended until

31.07.1977 and that the Appellant had failed to perform his part of the bargain by going

to the bank to sign the relevant documentation after the Respondent had arranged a bank

loan to make the balance payment. Accordingly, it was held that the Respondent was at

all times material to this action willing and ready to perform his part of the bargain

whereas the Appellant had failed to do so. Therefore, the learned trial judge dismissed

the action and granted specific performance.

The Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal which concurred with the findings of the

learned trial judge and dismissed the appeal.

Special leave to appeal was granted on the following questions of law:

(1) Is the finding of fact by the learned trial judge in regard to default vitiated by the

failure to take into account the relevant items of evidence?

(2) In any event, are the learned District Judge and the Court of Appeal in error to

determine as to whether this is an appropriate case in which specific performance

should be granted?

(3) If the plaintiff extended the time for purchase of property till 31.07.1977, is the

defendant entitled to limit the payment of money to the plaintiff on or before

31.07.1977?

(4) By extending the period till 31.07.1977, has the plaintiff waived his rights with

regard to the stipulation of time set out in the agreement to sell?

Page 5 of 28

(5) Has the plaintiff by his conduct and documents refused to execute a transfer, well

before the expiry of the stipulated time as extended?

(6) If so, can the plaintiff derive any benefit by the fact that the prices have escalated?

The first two questions of law were raised by the Appellant and the others by the

Respondent.

Time of Performance

Parties admitted the execution of the agreement to sell No. 431 (P1). According to P1, it

was agreed that the Appellant should sell transfer and convey and the Respondent should

purchase the premises for the sum of Rupees Forty-Five Thousand ( Rs. 45,000/=) free

from all encumbrances within three months from the date thereof.

P1 was executed on 14.02.1975. Hence, the parties should have performed their

respective obligations by 14.05.1975.

The case of the Appellant is that since the Respondent failed to perform his part of the

bargain by the time specified for performance, the Appellant was entitled to rescind from

the agreement and the Respondent became liable to handover the premises.

The governing law of P1 is Roman-Dutch law. Where any party to a contract fails to

perform his part of the bargain within the time fixed for performance, he is said to be in

default or mora.

Mora can be either mora ex re or mora ex persona.

Mora ex re arises where time for performance has been fixed in the contract and one party

fails to perform within the specified time. As Voet [22.1.26] succinctly explains, it is not

only men who make demands, but the law or even the date demands instead of a man,

provided only that a fixed date was made a term in the obligation.

Page 6 of 28

Mora ex persona arises where the contract does not specify a time for performance, but

on failure to perform within a reasonable time period, the creditor makes a demand for

performance but the debtor fails to comply with the demand.

However, mora does not by itself provide an innocent party the right to rescind from the

contract under Roman-Dutch law. In order for mora to result in the right to terminate,

time must be of essence of the agreement or must be made of essence by a proper notice.

Where the contract contains a special stipulation known as lex commissoria, the creditor

will have the right to resile from the contract where the debtor is in mora. Lex commissoria

means a pact annexed to a purchase at the time it is contracted to the effect that, unless

the price be paid at a certain time, the thing shall be considered as unbought [Voet 18.3.1].

Where the contract contains a stipulation known as lex commissoria, it will be an

indication that the parties intended time to be of essence of the contract.

I must therefore examine whether time is of the essence of P1.

Time is of Essence

The concept time is of the essence of the contract is derived from English legal

terminology and relates to the rule in English law concerning the right to withdraw from

a contract due to unreasonable delay on the part of the debtor to perform his part of the

bargain.

In Perera v. Abeysekera (58 NLR 505 at 530) Basnayake, C.J. examined what is meant by

time is of the essence of the contract and went on to explain that:

It means that the performance by one party at the time specified in the contract

is essential in order to enable him to require performance from the other party.

It means that time is so material that exact compliance with the terms of the

contract in this respect is essential to the right to require counter-performance.

The first point to be determined in deciding whether time is of the essence of a

Page 7 of 28

particular contract is whether the parties have expressly made it so. By that I do

not mean that it is essential to use the very words "time is of the essence" in the

contract, but it should appear from the expressed terms and the surrounding

circumstances taken as a whole that time is of the essence of the contract. It is

therefore primarily a matter of interpretation of the contract. If the answer to the

question whether time is of the essence is in the affirmative then the defaulter

cannot enforce performance by the other party. (emphasis added)

According to Weeramantry [Law of Contracts, Vol. II, page 1001 (1967)], in transactions

concerning land, stipulations as to time are not regarded as of the essence unless made

so in express terms or such intention appears from all the circumstances.

P1 specifically states that the Seller should sell transfer and convey the premises and the

Purchaser should purchase the property within three months from the date of the said

deed. Hence any delay in performance (mora) arises ex re.

Clauses 5 and 6 of P1, sets out different remedies available to the Purchaser and the Seller

respectively where the other party fails to perform his obligation on time, namely on or

before 14.05.1975.

The Purchaser is entitled to ask for a refund of the sum of Rs. 10,000/= paid as advance,

or to enforce the specific performance of P1 by the Seller or to be paid a sum of Rs.

10,000/= by way of liquidated and ascertained damages and not as a penalty.

The Seller is entitled to forfeit the sum of Rs. 10,000/= paid as advance, or to be paid a

sum of Rs. 10,000/= by way of liquidated damages and uncertain damages and not as a

penalty.

Cleary P1 contains a lex commissoria.

Moreover, the Appellant had by letter dated 12.08.1975 (P4), sent within three months of

the last date on which the balance payment should have been made by the Respondent

Page 8 of 28

(i.e. 14.05.1975), requested the Respondent to return the title deeds relating to the

transaction. This clearly is an indication that the Appellant considered time to be of

essence of P1.

The understanding of the Respondent appears to be the same. In letter dated 14.01.1976

(P6), the Respondent apologizes to the Appellant and asks him to accept his delay in

expediting the issue.

I therefore conclude that time is of essence of the agreement (P1) between the parties.

Both the Appellant and Respondent should have performed their respective obligations

by 14.05.1975.

Extension of Time

The Respondent claims that this time was extended until 31.07.1997 and relies on a letter

dated 08.06.1977 (P15) sent to him by Mr. S. Gnanapandithan, Attorney-at-Law for the

Appellant.

On the contrary, the Appellant submitted that he sued on P2 and not on any other

agreement. It was contended that although the Appellant had stated in the plaint that the

Respondent was granted an extension of time until 31.07.1977, the Appellant had at the

trial confined himself to the time specified in P1 and hence the statement in the plaint on

the extension of time until 31.07.1977 recedes to the background. The Appellant relied

on the decision in Hanaffi v. Nallamma [(1998) 1 SLR 73].

The Appellant further submitted that evidence on the purported extension of time is

inadmissible in view of Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Moreover, the Appellant submitted that the communication relied on by the Respondent

to establish the extension of time has been sent marked Without Prejudice and hence

inadmissible in view of Section 23 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Page 9 of 28

Accordingly, the question arises whether the time for performance was extended until

31.07.1977. The Respondent relies on two facts to establish such extension of time.

Section 150 of the Civil Procedure Code

Firstly, he points out that the Appellant had in his plaint (paragraph 8) specifically pleaded

that he had, at the request of the Respondent, granted the Respondent time until

31.07.1977 to perform his part of the bargain.

The Appellant countered that he had raised issues based on the time limit set out in P1

and that the statement in the plaint that time for performance was extended to

31.07.1977 recedes to the background in view of the decision in Hanaffi (supra), where it

was held that the trial proceeds on the issues and the pleadings recede to the background.

However, this position is untenable in law. Explanation 2 to Section 150 of the Civil

Procedure Code contains an important element of the rules of natural justice. It requires

the case enunciated at the trial to be reasonably in accord with the party's pleading, i.e.,

plaint or answer, as the case may be. No party is allowed to make at the trial a case

materially different from that which he has placed on record, and which his opponent is

prepared to meet. The facts proposed to be established must in the whole amount to so

much of the material part of his case as is not admitted in his opponent's pleadings.

The Appellant has in his plaint (paragraph 8) specifically pleaded that he had, at the

request of the Respondent, granted the Respondent time until 31.07.1977 to perform his

part of the bargain. This date is reflected in letter dated 28.06.1977 (P2) sent by the

Respondent to the Appellant indicating that the transaction could be finalized only by the

end of July 1977.

Hence, notwithstanding the absence of any formal admission having been recorded at the

trial of the extension of time, the Appellant cannot present his case on the footing that

Page 10 of 28

the time for performance of the respective obligations in P1 was 14.05.1975 and not

31.07.1977.

Secondly, the Respondent relied on letter dated 08.06.1977 (P15) sent to him by the

Attorney-at-Law for the Appellant. It states that based on the undertaking by the

Respondent to conclude the transaction early, the Appellant had instructed his lawyer to

stay legal action against him. It went on to state that as no steps have been taken by the

Respondent since his undertaking in March 1977, the Respondent is now informed that

unless the matter is concluded by the 17.06.1977, the Appellant will be compelled to take

action against him.

The Appellant submitted that P15 cannot be considered in evidence on two grounds.

Firstly, it has been sent without prejudice and hence is inadmissible in view of Section 23

of the Evidence Ordinance. Secondly, Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance

prohibits Court considering any evidence except what is specifically set out in P1.

Without Prejudice

Many jurisdictions restrict the use in evidence of communication, oral or written, made

during negotiations between parties on the express condition that it is made without

prejudice.

In Walker v. Wilsher [(1889) 23 QBD 335 at 337] Lindley, L.J. held that the meaning of

without prejudice is that they mean without prejudice to the position of the writer of

the letter if the terms he proposes are not accepted. If the terms proposed in the letter

are accepted a complete contract is established and the letter, although written without

prejudice, operates to alter the old state of things and to establish a new one.

In the United States, there is no provision identical to Section 23 of the Evidence

Ordinance, but federal laws have analogous rules.

Page 11 of 28

Prior to codification in the Federal Rules of Evidence, U.S. courts followed common law

principles on settlement communications, largely based on English legal traditions.

The Federal Rules of Evidence were enacted in 1975, including Rule 408, which broadly

excluded compromise offers and related statements from being admitted as evidence to

prove liability or the value of a claim. At the time of its adoption, Rule 408 primarily

focused on protecting civil litigation discussions but did not explicitly address its

application in criminal cases or regulatory settlements.

In 2006, Rule 408 was amended to address growing concerns about the misuse of

settlement negotiations in criminal proceedings. The amendment explicitly clarified that

statements made in civil settlement negotiations with government agencies could be

admitted in subsequent criminal cases. This change was prompted by cases where

defendants attempted to use Rule 408 as a shield against prosecution for fraud or

regulatory violations.

Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that evidence of offering or accepting

a valuable consideration in compromising a disputed claim as well as any conduct or

statements made during compromise negotiations is not admissible to prove the validity

or amount of a claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement.

This rule codifies the public policy favoring out-of-court settlements. As the Rules

Advisory Committee explained, exclusion rests on two grounds:

(a) Such evidence is often irrelevant to the merits because an offer of settlement

may reflect a desire for peace rather than an admission of weakness.

(b) Excluding the evidence promotes the public policy of encouraging free

communication in settlement negotiations.

Page 12 of 28

The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 408 explicitly articulate this reasoning, citing the

maxim that a party should be able to buy his peace without fear that an attempted

compromise will be construed as an admission.

Rule 408 is not an absolute bar on all uses of settlement communications. It prohibits

using compromise communications for certain purposes namely to prove or disprove

the validity or amount of a disputed claim but allows them if offered for other legitimate

purposes. The Rule itself lists examples: proof of a witnesss bias or prejudice, negating a

contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct justice.

The US Supreme Court has sought to follow a pragmatic approach in balancing competing

interests in the application of this rule. In Jaffee v. Redmond [518 US 1 (1996)] the Court

recognized a psychotherapist-patient privilege under federal common law, emphasizing

that certain confidential communications merit protection because the public good

transcends the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for

ascertaining truth.

According to Coomaraswamy [The Law of Evidence, Vol. II, Book 1, (Lake House

Investments Ltd), 158], the rule of evidence in English Law is that letters written and oral

communications made during a dispute or negotiation between parties and expressed or

otherwise proved to have been made without prejudice cannot in general be admitted in

evidence without the consent of both parties.

The rationale for this rule in English law is two-fold.

Firstly, the rule rests on public policy. It is public policy to encourage people to settle their

differences. As Cross observed [R. Cross and C. Tapper, Cross & Tapper on Evidence, 6th

Ed., 408], it is in the public interest that disputes should be settled and litigation reduced

to a minimum, so the policy of the law in favour of enlarging the cloak under which

negotiations may be conducted without prejudice. As Oliver L.J. stated in Cutts v. Head

[(1984) Ch 290 at 306], the public policy justification, in truth, essentially rests on the

Page 13 of 28

desirability of preventing statements or offers made in the course of negotiations for

settlement being brought before the court of trial as admissions on liability or quantum.

However, in Unilever Plc. v. Proctor & Gamble Co [(2000) WLR 2436 at 2448] Robert

Walker L.J., emphasized that without prejudice is not a label which can be used

indiscriminately so as to immunise an act from its normal legal consequences where there

is no genuine dispute for negotiation. Otherwise, it will be a convenient mode for any

party to make evidence that is otherwise admissible in legal proceedings, inadmissible.

In Avonwick Holdings Limited v. Webinvest Limited and Anor [(2014) EWCA Civ 1436 at

para. 17] Lewison L.J., stated that in order for this head of public policy to be engaged

there must be a dispute. The concept of dispute is given a wide scope so that an opening

shot of negotiations may fall within the policy even though the other party has not

rejected the offer. In order to decide whether this head of public policy is engaged, the

court must determine on an objective basis whether there was in fact a dispute or issue

to be resolved. If there was not then this head of public policy is not engaged.

Secondly, the rule is based on agreement of parties. It is possible for parties to extend the

usual ambit of the without prejudice rule. The rationale is that any express or implied

agreement between the parties that statements made in the course of their negotiations

and aimed at the settlement of a dispute should not be admissible. [See Unilever Plc v.

Proctor and Gamble Co. (supra. at 2442D), Muller v. Linsley and Mortimer [1996] PNLR

74 at 77]. As Lord Hope held in Ofulue v. Bossart [(2009) UKHL 16, p. 12]:

The essence of the rule lies in the nature of the protection that is given to parties

when they are attempting to negotiate a compromise. It is the ability to speak freely

that indicates where the limits of the rule should lie. Far from being mechanistic,

the rule is generous in its application. It recognises that unseen dangers may lurk

behind things said or written during this period, and it removes the inhibiting effect

that this may have in the interests of promoting attempts to achieve a settlement.

Page 14 of 28

As expounded in Unilever Plc. (supra), there are a number of recognised exceptions to the

without prejudice rule in English law. Without seeking to set out an exhaustive list, some

of the exceptions are:

1) When the issue is whether without prejudice communications have resulted

in a compromise agreement being reached.

2) when the issue is whether the agreement apparently concluded as a result of

the without prejudice negations should be set aside on the ground of

misrepresentation, fraud or undue influence.

3) when the issue is whether an estoppel has arisen due to a clear statement

which was made by one party to the without prejudice negotiations and on

which the other party is intended to rely or act, and does in fact rely or act, to

their detriment (even where no concluded settlement arises).

4) a party may be allowed to give evidence of what the other said or wrote in

without prejudice negotiations if the without prejudice rule which excludes

said evidence would act as a cloak for perjury, blackmail or other unambiguous

impropriety in the clearest cases of abuse of the privilege.

5) evidence of negotiations may be given in order to explain delay or apparent

acquiescence.

6) offers made without prejudice except as to costs.

7) a distinct form of the privilege in matrimonial cases which extends to

communications received in confidence with a view to matrimonial conciliation.

Section 23 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

23. In civil cases, no admission is relevant if it is made either upon an express

condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or under circumstances from which

the court can infer that the parties agreed together that evidence of it should not

be given. (emphasis added)

Page 15 of 28

In Multiform Chemicals (Private) Ltd., v. Machado [S.C. Appeal 183/2011, S.C.M.

18.07.2024] I held that three issues arise for consideration by a trial judge when a

document is sought to be tendered in evidence. They are relevancy, admissibility and

authenticity. All three must be determined by reference to the evidentiary rules in the

Evidence Ordinance and the Civil Procedure Code as amended, particularly by Act No. 17

of 2022.

Section 23 of the Evidence Ordinance deals with relevancy. Accordingly, no admission is

relevant in a civil case, if it was made:

(a) upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or

(b) under circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed

together that evidence of it should not be given.

P15 is clearly qualified by the words without prejudice which has been typed and

underlined on the top right-hand corner. Moreover, it has been sent in reply to letter dated

08.01.1977 (P14) sent by the lawyer for the Respondent which is also qualified by the

same words i.e. without prejudice. Additionally, P15 states that the Appellant has stayed

legal action against the Respondent on the undertaking of the Respondent to conclude

the transaction early.

Clearly there was an ongoing dispute between the parties and these communications

reflect an attempt at its resolution. In these circumstances, I have no hesitation in

concluding that P15 is entitled to the privilege set out in Section 23 of the Evidence

Ordinance on the basis of public policy.

Nevertheless, the privilege contained in Section 23 of the Evidence Ordinance can be

waived. However, it cannot be waived unilaterally as it is a joint privilege. There can only

be a joint waiver. In this case, P15 has been tendered and marked in evidence by none

other than the Appellant on whose behalf P15 was sent. Moreover, even P14 was

tendered and marked in evidence by the Appellant. The Respondent did not object to the

Page 16 of 28

marking of either. Therefore, I hold that the privilege attached to both P14 and P15 have

been waived by parties and that they were properly admitted in evidence.

Parole Evidence

The Appellant contended that P15 is in any event inadmissible in view of Sections 91 and

92 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Section 91 reads as follows:

When the terms of a contract, or of a grant, or of any other disposition of property

have been reduced by or by consent of the parties to the form of a document, and

in all cases in which any matter is required by law to be reduced to the form of a

document, no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract, grant,

or other disposition of property, or of such matter, except the document itself, or

secondary evidence of its contents in cases in which secondary evidence is

admissible under the provisions herein before contained. (emphasis added)

Section 91 is based on the best evidence principle. Oral evidence cannot be substituted

for the written instrument which is the very essence of the transaction. When a

transaction has been reduced to writing, either by the agreement of the parties or by

requirement of the law, the writing becomes the exclusive memorial of the transaction.

I observe that it is the Appellant himself who marked both P14 and P15. Having done so

it is somewhat perplexing that he is now trying to contend that P15 should not be

admitted in evidence.

Moreover, the Appellant did not, by marking P15, seek to prove the terms of the contract

between the parties. What was sought to be done was to show that there was a

subsequent agreement between parties that the time of performance was extended until

17.06.1977. This is consistent with the case the Appellant pleaded that time of

Page 17 of 28

performance was in fact extended albeit to 31.07.1977. Section 91 applies only to the

proof of the terms of the contract.

In any event, in Sangarapillai v. Arumugam [(1909) 2 Leader LR 161], Hutchinson C.J.,

held that if evidence which is repugnant to section 91 of the Evidence Ordinance is let in

by consent, it is too late for either party to object to its admission in appeal. In Seyed

Mohamed v. Perera (58 NLR 246) the ruling in Sangarapillai's case was challenged by

counsel who submitted that the law of evidence, far from being made subordinate to a

rule of procedure, should receive primary consideration. But De Silva, A.J., had (at page

256) no hesitation in rejecting this submission and endorsing the view in Sangarapillai

(supra).

This approach is justified when we consider the Explanation to Section 154(3) of the Civil

Procedure Code. It states that if the opposing party does not, on the document being

tendered in evidence, object to its being received, and if the document is not such as

is forbidden by law to be received in evidence, the court should admit it.

In Siyadoris v. Danoris (42 NLR 311) it was held that where a deed has been admitted in

evidence without objection at the trial, no objection that it has not been duly proved could

be entertained in appeal. Court was of the view that forbidden by law to be received in

evidence means absolute prohibition of the document. Section 91 only prevents the

receipt of other evidence in proof of the terms of such contract, grant, or other disposition

of property, or of such matter.

Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows:

When the terms of any such contract grant, or other disposition of property, or any

matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been proved

according to the last section, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall

be admitted, as between the parties to any such instrument, or their

Page 18 of 28

representatives in interest, for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or

subtracting from its terms. (emphasis added)

This rule amplifies the rule in Section 91. It is to the effect that when the terms of any such

contract, or other disposition of property, or any matter required by law to be reduced to

the form of a document, have been proved according to Section 91, no evidence of any

oral agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such

instrument, or their representatives in interest, for the purpose of contradicting, varying,

adding to or subtracting from its terms.

This prohibits admission of only oral evidence, for the purpose of contradicting, varying,

adding to, or subtracting from the terms of the written agreement between the parties. It

does not prevent the admission of subsequent written communication between parties

to prove that some term or terms of that agreement has subsequently been varied in

writing.

P15 shows that the time of performance agreed between the parties was subsequently

extended in writing by the Appellant himself. It was tendered in evidence by the

Appellant. In these circumstances, Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance also has no

application.

The Appellant contended he had not authorized Mr. Gnanapandithan, Attorney-at-Law &

Notary Public to send P15. I have no hesitation in rejecting this contention. Mr.

Gnanapandithan had acted on behalf of the Appellant and sent several letters to the

Respondent previously dated 12.08.1975 (P4), 13.08.1976 (P7), 24.08.1976 (P9) and

04.11.1976 (P11). In fact, it was Mr. Gnanapandithan who attested P1. More importantly,

the registered attorney on record in this action for the Appellant in the District Court is

Mr. Gnanapandithan.

Page 19 of 28

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the time of performance of P1 has been extended

by the Appellant to 31.07.1977. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeal were

correct in coming to this conclusion.

Waiver

Learned counsel for the Respondent submitted that the time period of three (3) months

specified in P1 for performance was waived by the Appellant by the grant of an extension

of time for the Respondent to perform his part of the bargain. In support of this

contention, he drew our attention to the decisions in Birmingham and District Land

Company v. London and North Western Railway Company [(1888) Ch. D. 268], Charles

Rickards Ltd. v. Oppenheim [(1950) 1 KB 616], Furst (Enrico) & Co. v. W.E. Fischer, Ltd.

[(1960) 2 Lloyds Rep. 340] and W.J. Alan Ltd. v. El Nasr Co. [(1972) 2 All ER 127].

In Birmingham and District Land Company (supra. 286) Bowen L.J., held as follows:

if persons who have contractual rights against others induce by their conduct

those against whom they have such rights to believe that such rights will either not

be enforced or will be kept in suspense or abeyance for some particular time, those

persons will not be allowed by a Court of Equity to enforce the rights until such time

has elapsed, without at all events placing the parties in the same position as they

were before.

In Charles Rickards Ltd. v. Oppenheim [(1950) 1 KB 616 at 623] Lord Denning restated this

proposition as follows:

If the defendant, as he did, led the plaintiffs to believe that he would not insist on

the stipulation as to time, and that, if they carried out the work, he would accept it,

and they did it, he could not afterwards set up the stipulation as to the time against

them. Whether it be called waiver or forbearance on his part, or an agreed variation

or substituted performance, does not matter. It is a kind of estoppel. By his conduct

Page 20 of 28

he made a promise not to insist on his strict legal rights. That promise was intended

to be binding, intended to be acted on, and was in fact acted on. He cannot

afterwards go back on it.

In Furst (Enrico) & Co. [supra. at 349] Lord Diplock held that:

Waiver does not vary the terms of the contractWaiver is conduct on the part of

a party to a contract which affects his remedies for a breach of contract by the other

party.

Again in W.J. Alan Ltd. [supra. at 140] Lord Denning went on to give a more detailed

exposition of the principle as follows:

The principle of waiver is simply this: If one person by his conduct, leads another

to believe that the strict rights arising under the contract will not be insisted on,

intending that the other should act on that belief and he does act on it, then the

first party will not afterwards be allowed to insist on the strict legal eights when it

would be inequitable for him to do soThere may be no consideration moving from

him who benefits from the waiver. There may be no detriment to him by acting on

it. There may be nothing in writing. Nevertheless, the one who waives his strict

rights cannot afterwards insist on them. His strict rights are at any rate suspended

so long as the waiver lasts. He may on occasion be able to revert to his strict legal

rights for the future by giving reasonable notice in that behalf, or otherwise making

it plain by his conduct that he will thereafter insist on themBut there are cases

where no withdrawal is possible. It may be too late to withdraw; or it cannot be

done without injustice to the other party. In that event he is bound by his waiver.

He will not be allowed to revert to his strict legal rights. He can only enforce them

subject to the waiver he has made.

I have no doubt that these authorities correctly set out the position in English law.

However, the governing law of P1 is the Roman-Dutch law. Release or acceptilatio is the

Page 21 of 28

corresponding principle in Roman-Dutch law. It is a discharge or acquittance of an

obligation, made by agreement between the parties, before the obligation has been

performed, or fully performed. According to Grotius (3.41.2), Release is done either by act

of man, or by the operation of law. Release can be express or implied. Where it is implied,

the term waiver is generally used.

A waiver may be implied where the conduct of the creditor consists of some unequivocal

act showing that he knew what his rights were and that he intended to surrender them

[See Laws v. Rutherfurd (1924 AD 261 at 263); Collen v. Rietfontein Engineering Works

[1948 (1) SA 413 (A) at 436]; Martin v. De Kock [1948(2) SA 719(A) at 732]; Borstlap v.

Spangenberg [1974(3) SA 695(A) at 704]]. However, it is important that the creditor

manifests his intention to do so and it is communicated to the debtor. [See Traub v.

Barclays National Bank Ltd. [1983(3) SA 619(A) at 634-5]. There must be an acceptance

of this benefit by the debtor or by someone on his behalf.

However, the written communication between parties does not establish that the

Appellant waived his right to insist on timely performance of P1.

By letter dated 12.08.1975 (P4), sent within three months of the due date of performance

in terms of P1, the Appellant requested the Respondent to return the title deeds relating

to the premises. This is a clear indication of his intention to exercise his right to the timely

performance of the obligation of the Respondent.

The Respondent replied to this letter by letter dated 25.08.1975 (P5). It states that the

Respondent has applied for a loan to the Department of National Housing which was

approved but the department is not in a position to grant the loan due to insufficient

funding. Thereafter, the Respondent had applied to Ceylon State Mortgage Bank for a

loan. The bank is now awaiting the insurance binder to take further steps. The Appellant

was informed that the Respondent will be in a position to obtain the loan from the bank

very early to settle the balance consideration.

Page 22 of 28

However, it appears that even by 14.01.1976 the Respondent was not able to tender the

balance consideration of P1. Hence on that day he wrote P6 to the Appellant describing

various reasons for his inability to obtain a loan. He goes on to urge the Appellant to accept

his delay in expediting the issue and that he has been taken for a ride by the institutions

referred to therein for various shortcomings and unwanted documents. He apologizes and

states that he will do his best to expedite the matter and pay the balance consideration.

This request by the Respondent to the Appellant to accept his delay confirms that the

Appellant has not up to that point of time waived his right to insist on timely performance

of the obligation of the Respondent.

On 13.08.1976 the Appellant sent P7 to the Respondent by which he claimed a sum of Rs.

31,500/= being damages due to him in terms of letter dated 06.11.1974 (P3) and

continuing damages at the rate of Rs. 50/= per day from 14.08.1976 till vacant possession

of the premises are handed back. P3 is the document signed by the Respondent when he

was given possession of the premises free of rent by the Appellant on 06.11.1974 on the

undertaking to deliver vacant possession back on 22.11.1974.

The dispatch of P7 is inconsistent of any waiver of timely performance of P1. No doubt,

P7 was sent in relation to P3. Nevertheless, P1 was entered into subsequent to P3 been

signed by the Respondent. There was no need to demand vacant possession of the

premises by P7 had the Appellant decided to waive timely performance of P1 and grant

the Respondent further time.

The Respondent replied to P7 by letter dated 18.08.1976 (P8). There he reiterates of

having applied for a loan of Rs. 35,000/= from the Ceylon State Mortgage Bank for the

purpose of purchasing the premises. He states that the bank has sanctioned the loan by

letter dated 18.06.1976 and is now waiting for the final insurance binder from the

Insurance Corporation. He claims to have paid the necessary charges and that the

corporation will forward its final insurance binder within two weeks to the bank. He goes

Page 23 of 28

on to provide the reference numbers of the bank and corporation should the Appellant

wish to verify this information.

In response to P8, the Appellant sent letter dated 24.08.1976 (P9). He states that the

Respondent failed to purchase the premises within three months as required by P1 and

reiterates the contents of P4 where by the Respondent was requested to return the title

deeds to the premises immediately. The Appellant goes on to specifically state that he is

not obliged to sell the premises to the Respondent.

In my view, the communication up to this point of time does not establish that there has

been any waiver or release of the obligation on the part of the Respondent to perform his

obligation on time. On the contrary, it clearly shows that the Appellant has taken up the

position that he is not under any obligation to sell the premises. In fact, he makes a claim

for damages from the Respondent for the failure to hand back vacant possession.

On 02.11.1976 the Respondent sends letter dated 02.11.1976 (P10) to the Appellant

informing him that the loan is ready and that the Appellant should call over at the bank

and sign the deed of transfer on or before 10.11.1976. He calls upon the Appellant to

inform the date on which he can call over at the bank so that the Respondent can also be

present. The Appellant was informed that the bank will pay him the balance consideration.

The Appellant responded to P10 by letter dated 04.11.1976 (P11). He reiterates the

contents of P7 and P9 and affirms the stand taken earlier that he is not obliged to sell the

premises to the Respondent. The Appellant once again calls upon the Respondent to

return the title deeds relating to the property without further delay.

The Respondent placed much reliance on the notification given by P10 calling upon the

Appellant to come to the bank to sign the deed of transfer to establish that the

Respondent made tender of performance which was rejected by the Appellant. This

contention is untenable for the reasons set out above. The Appellant had by then clearly

notified the Respondent of his decision not to sell the premises and put him on notice of

Page 24 of 28

this obligation to pay damages for failure to hand over vacant possession of the premises.

To that date (i.e. 04.11.1976), there was no waiver or release of the timely performance

of the obligation of the Respondent.

In any event, there is a dispute as to whether the loan from the Ceylon State Mortgage

Bank was actually available on 02.11.1976, the date of letter marked P10, as the bank had

by letter dated 23.08.1976 (P16) informed the Respondent that since there had been no

progress in his loan application from 18.06.1976, the bank has rejected the loan and

closed his file. The letter goes on to say that the balance of the initial deposit made by the

Respondent will be refunded after recovery of bank expenses.

Question of law No. 5 is answered in the negative.

On 23.12.1976 the Respondent sent another letter to the Appellant (P13). The letter sets

out more details of the attempts by the Respondent to obtain a loan. He goes on to state

that time is not of the essence of P1. The Respondent requests the Appellant to call over

at the bank on or before 24.12.1976 to sign the documents.

Thereafter it appears that some discussions had taken place between the parties during

which the Appellant suggested that the Respondent pay the rent for the period occupied

by the Respondent to enable the finalization of the sale of the premises. The Respondent

by letter dated 08.01.1976 (P14) sent without prejudice informs that he is agreeable to

this proposal and request the Appellant to inform whether he is agreeable to finalise the

transaction.

No written communication between the parties thereafter have been produced in

evidence until letter dated 08.06.1977 (P15) was sent by the Appellant to the Respondent

where he states that legal action against him has been stayed on the undertaking of the

Respondent to conclude the transaction. The Appellant further states that since no steps

have been taken by the Respondent since his undertaking in March 1977, he will be

Page 25 of 28

compelled to take action against the Respondent unless the transaction is concluded by

17.06.1977.

In my view, the most crucial item of evidence in this appeal is the letter dated 28.06.1977

(P2) sent by the Respondent to the Appellant in response to letter dated 08.06.1977 (P15).

There the Respondent states that because of various disputes, even the bank wanted to

cancel the loan and the Respondent had with the greatest difficulty kept the loan going

with the bank. He goes on to state that he will now make arrangements to finalise the

matter by making the extra payment called by the bank and also the extra payment the

Respondent amicably promised to pay to the Appellant. He further goes on to state that

the matter could be finalized only by the end of July 1977 as he has to make the necessary

arrangements.

Even assuming that there was a prior waiver or release by the Appellant, it was possible

for him to make time of the essence again of the agreement between the parties. In W.J.

Alan Ltd. [supra. at 140] Lord Denning held that it is possible for a person who has waived

his right to timely performance to be able to revert to his strict legal rights for the future

by giving reasonable notice in that behalf, or otherwise making it plain by his conduct that

he will thereafter insist on them.

P15 in my view is due notice given to the Respondent of the intention of the Appellant to

consider the extended time of performance as being of essence of P1 notwithstanding

any extension. We have before us a situation where time was of essence at the time

parties entered into the agreement. This time of performance was extended by P15.

Hence the question arises as to whether the Appellant can once again make time the

essence of P1 by giving such notice.

The converse position was considered in Microutsicos v. Swart [(1949) 3 SALR 715] where

the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa considered the question as to

when delay on the part of a buyer in making provision for payment of the purchase price

Page 26 of 28

of land is regarded as equivalent to total failure which entitles the seller to regard it as

terminating the contract. It was decided in that case that Roman Dutch Law, like English

Law, does not regard the mere fact that the debtor makes default on the stipulated date,

if there is one, as sufficient for this purpose. Fagan, A. J. A. held (at page 715) that:

"where a time for the performance of a vital term in a contract has been stipulated

for and one party is in mora by reason of his failure to perform it within that time,

but time is not of the essence of the contract, the other party can make it so by

giving notice that if the obligation is not complied with by a certain date, allowing

a reasonable time, he will regard the contract as at an end.

I have no doubt the same rationale is applicable where time was of essence of an

agreement between parties from its inception, and later the time of performance was

extended by parties. One party is entitled to make time of essence once again by giving

due notice to the other party. Modern commercial requirements require parties to

commercial transactions to have the freedom to continue with their commercial activities

without being held for ransom by intransigent counterparts. That can only be done by

recognizing the right of a party to make time of the essence of an agreement once again

by giving due notice to the other party.

In this action, the Appellant appears to have extended the time of performance by P15

with a view to settle the dispute. However, in the same letter the Respondent is notified

that failure on the part of the Respondent to conclude the transaction by 17.06.1977 will

compel the Appellant to take action against him.

I therefore hold that the extended time of performance i.e. 31.07.1977 continued to be

of essence of the agreement between the parties.

Question of law No. 4 is answered in the negative.

Page 27 of 28

Failure of the Appellant

The extension of time until 31.07.1977 as pleaded in the plaint came into existence only

after P2 was sent. Hence, in order to succeed in the cross claim, the Respondent should

have led evidence to show that he had made the bank loan operative and notified the

Appellant to execute the required documents. However, no such evidence has been led in

this case. Although a witness from the State Mortgage and Investment Bank was called to

testify on behalf of the Respondent, he did not testify on any loan been made operational

after letter dated 28.06.1977 (P2) was sent. His testimony referred to making a loan

operational towards the end of 1976 during which period the documentary evidence

establishes that the Appellant had taken up the position that he did not need to execute

any documents in favour of the Respondent since he failed to perform his part of the

bargain by 14.05.1975.

In summary, the evidence discloses the following:

(1) Time was of the essence of P1.

(2) Both parties had to perform their respective obligations by 14.05.1975.

(3) The Respondent failed to perform his part of the obligation by 14.05.1975.

(4) On or after 08.06.1977, the time for performance was extended until 31.07.1977.

(5) By that time, the Appellant had not waived or released the Respondent from

making a timely performance.

(6) However, the Respondent failed to tender the balance amount by 31.07.1977.

For all the foregoing reasons, questions of law Nos. 1 and 3 in the affirmative.

A party seeking to enforce specific performance of a contract should have been ready and

willing to perform his part of the bargain by the time for performance. The Respondent

has failed to lead any evidence to show that he had made tender of the balance

consideration on or before 31.07.1977. He is therefore not entitled to any order of specific

performance.

Page 28 of 28

Accordingly, I answer question of law No. 2 in the affirmative.

In view of the answers given to questions of law Nos. 1 to 5 above, question of law No. 6

does not arise.

For all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Mt.

Lavinia dated 19.07.1979 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 29.03.2016 are

hereby set aside.

I enter judgment in favour of the Appellant as prayed for in prayers (a) and (b) the plaint

dated 20.04.1979 which reads as follows:

a) for judgment ejecting the defendant, his servants and agents and all those

holding under him from the land and premises more fully described in the schedule

hereto;

b) for liquidated damages in the sum of Rs. 10,000/-.

The learned District Judge of Mt. Lavinia is directed to enter decree accordingly.

The Appeal is allowed with costs.
