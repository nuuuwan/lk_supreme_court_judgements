"by Dharmapriya for having supposedly advised Ratnayake not to reveal the name"
"of Nadarajah in the entry made on the Information Book, is highly improbable."
"F
urthermore, that entry made by Ratnayake does not indicate that Wijesinghe had"
"identified the perpetrator or that the identity of the person who engaged in the act"
"of misconduct has been established by that time. As pointed out above, the sole"
"purported eye-witness to this incident being Wijesinghe, not having made an entry"
"in the Information Book, further weakens the case for the Appellant company. In"
"fact, Wijesinghe had not even testified at the domestic inquiry."
"T
he position of the Appellant company is that Ratnayake informed Dharmapriya"
"the name of the person who engaged in the act of misconduct, as his identity had"
"been 
established 
through  Wijesinghe  by 
the 
time  Ratnayake 
telephoned"
"Dharmapriya. In fact, Dharmapriya in his testimony has specifically said that he"
"was  informed  by  Ratnayake  the  name  of  Nadarajah,  as  being  the  person  who"
"threw the goods of the company over the parapet wall. However, in his e-mail to"
"a fellow officer Irsula Rajakaruna (with a copy being sent to the Chief Executive"
"Officer Gamini De Silva) sent on the following day at 10.54 a.m. for the purpose of"

Security  had  found  06  nos.  of  iron  bass  (sic)  and  a  can  which  belongs  to  the"
"company that someone has pass (sic) over the perimeter wall behind the garage"
"…” [Emphasis added by me.]"
"I
t would be seen that, the impression being  generated by the contents of this e-"
"mail is that, the security had found (and not that a security officer had seen the"
"property  being  thrown  over  the  parapet  wall)  certain  property  of  the  company"
"outside the premises of the company. Furthermore, if Wijesinghe in fact had seen"
"the  property  of  the  company  being  thrown  over the  parapet  wall,  it  would  not"
"have  given  rise  to  a  need  for  Dharmapriya  to  inquire  from  Irsula  Rajakaruna"
"whether the thrown property belongs to the company. The contents of the e-mail"
"are  more  in  line  with  some  security  officer  having  found  these  items  on  the"
"adjacent compound, without having seen an employee throwing over the parapet"
"wall  certain  goods  from  within  the  company  premises.  Furthermore,  if  in  fact"
"Dharmapriya was told by Ratnayake the identity of the employee who threw the"
