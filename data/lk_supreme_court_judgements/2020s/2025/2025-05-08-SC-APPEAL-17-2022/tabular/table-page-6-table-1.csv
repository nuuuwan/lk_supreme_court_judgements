"Appellant  company,  Ratnayake  did  not 
take  any  action  against  Nadarajah."
"Nadarajah left the premises of the company without being informed of what was"
"seen  by  Wijesinghe,  being  questioned  in  that  regard,  searched  or  his  statement"
"being recorded."
"13) On the advice given by Dharmapriya,  Ratnayake made an entry (a note) (“R3”)"
"regarding  the  incident  in  the  Information  Book  (an  official  book  maintained  by"
"security  personnel  and  kept  at 
the  security  post).  Also,  on 
the  advice  of"
"Dharmapriya, Ratnayake did not include in his entry the identity (the name) of the"
"employee  (Nadarajah)  who  was  seen  throwing  away  property  of  the  company."
"The reason was that  Nadarajah was a long-standing employee  of the company,"
"and since there were two strong Trade Unions functioning within the Appellant"
"company."
"14) By 
letter  dated  2nd  October  2017  addressed  to  the  Security  Manager  of  the"
"company, Ratnayake communicated details of the incident which occurred on the"
"evening  of  1st  October  2017  (“R4”).  On  the  evening  of  2nd  October  2017,  at  the"
"security post, Dharmapriya in the presence of Ratnayake, questioned Nadarajah"
"regarding the incident. While crying, Nadarajah admitted the allegation against"
"him of throwing-over the parapet wall, property of the company, namely six iron"
"tubes and the can. On 3rd October 2017 at 10.35 a.m., Dharmapriya made an entry"
"to this effect in the Information Book (“R2”). However, later, when Nadarajah was"
"interviewed  by  personnel  of  the  Human  Resources  Division  of  the  Appellant"
"company and  his statement  was  recorded  (“R9”), he denied both the allegation"
"against him and that he confessed to Dharmapriya."
"15) By letter dated 4th October 2017, the Appellant company conveyed its decision to"
"Nadarajah that he had been suspended from employment due to the afore-stated"
"misconduct.  Consequently,  by 
letter  dated  9th  October  2017,  Nadarajah  was"
"required to ‘show cause’ as to why disciplinary action should not be taken against"
"him with regard to his misconduct (“R7”). In response, by a letter submitted to the"
"Appellant company on 11th October 2017, Nadarajah refuted the allegation against"
"him.  Following  the  conduct  of  a  disciplinary  inquiry  by  an  external  inquiring"
"officer and the findings thereon, the employment of the employee was terminated"
"(“R8”)."
