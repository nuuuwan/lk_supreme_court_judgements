"This question does not arise, as neither the learned President of the Labour"
"Tribunal nor the learned Judge of the High Court had ordered the payment"
"of any compensation. The order for the payment of back wages was a lawful"
"order,  as  it  was  founded  upon  a  finding  of  fact  that  the  termination  of"
"employment  was  wrongful,  unfair  and  unjust.  Therefore,  Nadarajah  is"
"entitled to receive back wages coupled with reasonable compensation for"
"the unjustified termination of employment."
