"In  the  conduct  of  proceedings  under  this  Act,  any  industrial  court,  labour  tribunal,"
"arbitrator  or  authorized  officer  or  the  Commissioner  shall  not  be  bound  by  any  of  the"
"provisions of the Evidence Ordinance."
"The  jurisdiction  to  be  exercised  by  the  Labour  Tribunal  as  per  Section  31  (C)  of  the"
"Industrial Disputes Act is to make an order which appears to the tribunal to be just and"
"equitable.  Thus,  the  question  to  be  decided  here  in  this  appeal  is  whether  there  was"
"sufficient evidence before the Labour Tribunal which would have warranted it to hold"
"that  the  termination  of  the  services  of  the  Employee  on  the  charges  of  the  specified"
"misconduct  have  been  proved  on  the  balance  of  probability.  Although  the  nature  of"
"misconduct may amount to the commission of a criminal act involving moral turpitude,"
"as stated before, even such misconduct need not be proved with proof beyond reasonable"
"doubt  as  in  a  criminal  case.  Thus,  the  evaluation  of  evidence  to  ascertain  whether  the"
"allegations have been proved must be done while keeping the provisions in Section 31"
"(C) and Section 36 (4) of the Industrial Disputes Act in mind. In my view, it would be"
"erroneous to evaluate and come to a conclusion on the basis that such misconduct should"
"be proved beyond reasonable doubt as in a criminal case."
