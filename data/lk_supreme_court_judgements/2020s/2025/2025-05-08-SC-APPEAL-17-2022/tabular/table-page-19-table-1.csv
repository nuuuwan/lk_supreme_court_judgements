"42) Labour Tribunal’s appreciation of the admissibility of the purported confession"
"– As pointed out in paragraph 40 above, it is highly doubtful that Nadarajah had"
"confessed  to  Dharmapriya.  It  is  clear  that  the  learned  President  of  the  Labour"
"Tribunal had also entertained the same doubt. However, it must be appreciated"
"that, though the learned President of the Labour Tribunal in his Order has referred"
"to the confession purportedly made by Nadarajah to Dharmapriya, as pointed out"
"by learned counsel for the Appellant, the analysis of that item of evidence is rather"
"poor."
