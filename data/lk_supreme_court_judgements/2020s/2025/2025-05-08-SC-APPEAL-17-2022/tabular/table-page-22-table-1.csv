"basis of the Appellant company having allegedly lost confidence in Nadarajah is"
"faulty. Furthermore, at the Inquiry held before the learned President of the Labour"
"Tribunal, the Appellant company had not presented any evidence that due to the"
"impugned conduct of Nadarajah, the company had lost confidence in him."
"I
n Tunis v. The Sri Lanka State Trading Corporation (Textiles) Salu Sala [(1990) 1"
"SLR  369]  this  Court  has  held  that,  “…  the  mere  assertion  by  the  employer  is  not"
"sufficient to justify the termination of a workman on the ground of loss of confidence. When"
"such an assertion is made it is incumbent on the Labour Tribunal to consider whether the"
"employer's apprehension is well founded. In such a situation, in my view, the evidence of"
"loss of  confidence must originate from the employer …”. To succeed on this footing,"
"‘loss of confidence’ must emanate from the evidence of the employer, and not from"
"the submissions of learned counsel. Furthermore, though learned counsel for the"
"Appellant company insisted that the Appellant had lost confidence in Nadarajah,"
"in the Answer dated 23rd January 2018 filed in the Labour Tribunal (“X2”) there is"
"no  assertion that  the company had lost confidence in  Nadarajah.  Therefore,  the"
"ground of ‘loss of confidence’ as not proven, should not be a valid ground to have"
"terminated the services of Nadarajah."
"S
econd, the Appellant company claims that even if the termination of services of"
"Nadarajah  had  been  unjustified,  and  the  fraud  or  dishonesty  is 
‘alleged’,  the"
"Appellant  would  be  in  a  difficult  position  to  entrust  Nadarajah  with  certain"
"responsibilities due to the loss of trust and confidence previously reposed in him."
"In  this  circumstance,  the  Appellant  company  claims  that  it  is  inappropriate  to"
"order reinstatement, and therefore, any award should be limited to compensation"
"only.  As  observed  by  this  Court  in  the  case  of  Jayasuriya  v.  Sri  Lanka  State"
"Plantations  Corporation 
[(1995)  2  Sri  L.R.  379],  unjustified 
termination  of"
"employment  may  not  always  lead  to  reinstatement  when  the  employer  had"
"‘alleged’ a lack of confidence on the employee; instead, compensation, rather than"
"reinstatement would be the appropriate remedy."
"T
his  position  has  been  reaffirmed  in  the  case  of  John  Keells  Ltd.  v  Ceylon"
"Mercantile, Industrial and General Workers Union and Others [(2006) 1 Sri.LR 48],"
"in which it has been held as follows:"
"“
There  are  circumstances,  where  alternative  relief  in  lieu  of  reinstatement  is"
"granted even if the workman is not found guilty to the charge. Instances include"
"SC APPEAL 17/2022 - JUDGMENT 
22"
