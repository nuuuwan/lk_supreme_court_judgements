"“If an officer appointed to perform judicial functions exercised the discretion vested"
"in him, but did so erroneously, his order would nevertheless be “judicial”. However,"
"an order made by such an officer would not be “judicial” if he had not exercised his"
"discretion, for example, if he had abdicated his authority, or had acted mechanically,"
"by simply acceding to or acquiescing in proposals made by the police – of which there"
"was insufficient evidence in that case."
"On the other hand, if a judicial officer was required by law to perform some function"
"in respect of which the law itself had deprived him of any discretion, then his act was"
"not judicial.”"
