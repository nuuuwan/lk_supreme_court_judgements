WRITTEN

SUBMISSIONS:

1st, 2nd, 4th to 15th Respondents on 02nd September 2022

Petitioner on 29th August 2023 and 28th November 2024

ARGUED ON: 07th November 2024

DECIDED ON: 18th March 2025

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The instant case is a fundamental rights application relating to the arrest of the Petitioner

and the subsequent detention pursuant to two Detention Orders, dated 30th January

2020 under the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, No. 17 of 1929 and

dated 06th February 2020 under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act.

This Court granted leave on Articles 12, 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution.

2. The instant application was filed while the Petitioner was in remand custody subsequent

to the first Detention Order but prior to the latter taking effect, stating that her

fundamental rights are imminently threatened. During the course of these proceedings,

the question before this Court changed its colour to a more complex one, with the validity

of the latter Detention Oder itself being called into question. For ease of analysis, I have

set out below a brief narration of facts.

FACTUAL MATRIX

3. According to the Petitioner, she and her brother, who were arrested on 30th January 2020

by the 3rd to 10th Respondents in the Bandaragama area for possession of Heroin, had

subsequently been detained for 7 days at the Special Crime Investigation Division,

Western Province (North), Peliyagoda by virtue of a Detention Order issued by the

Magistrates Court of Panadura in terms of Section 82(3) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 22

4. The Petitioner states that she was interrogated for prolonged periods of time by the 1st

and 11th Respondents and that she was threatened with detention under the Prevention

of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the PTA) unless she admits the involvement of one Kelum Indika with the

allegations levelled against her.

5. The Respondents deny all such accusations and state that they stopped and searched a

specific motorcycle pursuant to information and direction received from the 12th

Respondent and proceeded to arrest its rider and the passenger, who happened to be

the Petitioners brother and the Petitioner, having found Heroin hidden in their

possession. The officers had also recovered, among other things, a set of 3 keys from a

wallet found in the Petitioners possession.

6. Thereafter, the officers had gone on to search a rented house where the Petitioner and

her brother made their residence. The Respondents state that Petitioners sister-in-law

was present at the said property and that she was also arrested on the same day for

aiding and abetting the trafficking of Heroin.

7. The Respondents further state that they found an almirah in the said house and later

discovered the keys found in the Petitioners possession to be that of the said almirah.

They had recovered a large quantity of Heroin, 10 firearms and 19 magazines from this

almirah. Thereafter, the officers had informed the arrestees that they were also arrested

with respect to the offence of possession of firearms without a license.

8. The journal entries dated 30th January 2020 of the Magistrates Court Case No. B.

71557/20 indicates that the 11th Respondent has produced the Petitioner before the

Panadura Magistrate within 24 hours together with a B-Report, seeking an order from

the learned Magistrate to detain the suspects for 7 days for the purpose of further

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 22

investigations. Accordingly, the learned Magistrate has issued the aforementioned

Detention Order dated 30th January 2020 to detain the Petitioner for 7 days.

9. While the Petitioner was so detained, on 03rd February 2020, the 11th Respondent had

requested in writing from the Director of the Range Crime Division Western Province

(North) that another detention order be issued against the Petitioner in terms of Section

9(1) of PTA for she was suspected of having committed several offences under the PTA.1

This request had then made it way to the Minister of Defence, forwarded by the Director

of Range Crime Division Western Province (North) through the Superintendent of the

Kelaniya Division and the 12th Respondent.2

10. Accordingly, as the previous 7-day Detention Order issued by the Panadura Magistrate

elapsed on 06th February, the Minister of Defence had issued the Detention Order dated

06th February 2020 against the Petitioner for 90 days. As it is the validity of this Detention

Order the Petitioners have called into question, I shall henceforth refer to the same as

the impugned Detention Order.

11. On the same day, when Case No. B. 71557/20 was called before the Panadura Magistrate,

the prosecution had reported facts to the learned Magistrate regarding the investigation

being carried out seeking the Magistrate to allow the detention of the Petitioner for a

further 90 days as provided by the impugned Detention Order.

12. However, as the prosecution could not provide a hard copy to the court, the learned

Magistrate had wisely committed the Petitioner to remand custody until 13th February

2020. The instant application was filed by the Petitioner on 12th February 2020, alleging

1 Document marked R4

2 Documents marked R5, R6 and R7, respectively

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 22

an imminent infringement of her fundamental rights, while she was still in remand

custody.

13. Thereafter, when the Petitioner was once again produced before the Magistrates Court

on 13th February 2020 for remand extension, the 11th Respondent had submitted a

hardcopy of the impugned Detention Order to court and made submissions seeking an

order committing the Petitioner to police custody to be detained at the Range Crime

Division Western Province (North).

14. Having postponed the order on two occasions, the learned Magistrate had committed

the Petitioner to police custody for 90 days by order dated 12th March 2020.3 Thereafter,

on 24th March 2020, after 12 days of detention under the impugned PTA Detention Order,

the prosecution had reported facts to the Magistrate.

15. Although the Petitioner was detained only for a short period of time at the Range Crime

Division Western Province (North) by virtue of the Detention Order give under the PTA,

the Petitioner contends her detention to be illegal.

16. Her contention is rather straightforward, yet it requires a nuanced look. In essence, the

Petitioner challenges the validity of the detention order, arguing that there was no

Minister of Defence at the time of issuing the said detention order under the PTA.

LEGALITY OF THE DETENTION ORDER

17. Section 9(1) of the PTA (prior to the amendment by Act No. 12 of 2022) provided that,

Where the Minister has reason to believe or suspect that any person is connected

with or concerned in any unlawful activity, the Minister may order that such person

be detained for a period not exceeding three months in the first instance, in such

3 Journal Entry dated 12th March 2020 of Panadura Magistrates Court Case No. B. 71557/20

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 22

place and subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Minister, and any

such order may be extended from time to time for a period not exceeding three

months at a time:

Provided, however, that the aggregate period of such detention shall not exceed a

period of eighteen months4

18. It is very clear that detention orders under Section 9(1) of the PTA can only be issued by

the Ministerthe Minister of Defence to be specific, as the PTA was listed under laws

and ordinances to be implemented by the Minister of Defence, by then President

Gotabaya Rajapaksa, in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2153/12 dated 10th December 2019.5

19. The primary question this Court must consider, then, is whether the Petitioner was correct

in her assertion that there was no Minister of Defence at the time when the impugned

Detention Order was issued.

20. As the Petitioner contended, this Detention Order has, in fact, been signed by then

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in his capacity as the President. The Respondents did not

dispute this fact. The Petitioner argued that the very fact that it was signed by Gotabaya

Rajapaksa as the President of the Republic instead of the Minister of Defence was a defect

in the said Detention Order.

21. I am not inclined to agree with this position. So long as an order, decision or the like is

made by a person who has such authority in terms of the law to act in the manner has, it

matters not what seal he may or may not use, for such pedantic procedural defects are

unlikely to cause serious prejudice.

4 Emphasis added

5 Produced marked A appended to the Written Submissions of the Petitioner dated 29th August 2023

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 22

22. The incumbent President, as of the date of this judgment, indeed has the legal authority

to make such detention orders as the Minister of Defence may be empowered to make.

This is so by virtue of Article 44(3) of the Constitution, as amended by the 20th

Amendment, which provides that [t]he President shall be the Minister in charge of the

subject of Defence.

23. However, the Twentieth Amendment, which was certified on 29th October 2020, was not

in effect at the time material to the instant application, viz. 06th February 2020, the date

on which the Impugned Detention Order was issued.

24. The amendment which was in effect at this point in time was the Nineteenth Amendment.

Article 43 of the Constitution (as amended by the Nineteenth Amendment) provided

that,

(1) The President shall, in consultation with the Prime Minister, where he considers such

consultation to be necessary, determine the number of Ministers of the Cabinet of

Ministers and the Ministries and the assignment of subjects and functions to such

Ministers.

(2) The President may, on the advice of the Prime Minister, appoint from among

Members of Parliament, Ministers, to be in charge of the Ministries so

determined6

25. Similarly, Article 44(1) provides for the President to appoint Ministers who are not

members of the cabinet, on the advice of the Prime Minister, and that, too, from among

Members of Parliament.

6 Emphasis added

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 22

26. Very clearly, under the Constitution as amended by the Nineteenth Amendment to the

Constitution, only a Member of Parliament could be appointed a Minister, be it a Cabinet

Minister or not. However, the transitional clauses in the Nineteenth Amendment, which

were cited by the Petitioner as well as the Respondents, also warrant consideration.

27. Section 50 of the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution states,

During the period commencing on the date on which this Act comes into

operation (other than the provisions of section 9, in so far as it relates to paragraph (1)

of Article 46 and the provisions of sections 15, 28, 29, 30 and 31) and ending on the

date on which the next General Election of the Members of Parliament is

concluded,:-

(a) the President may, with the concurrence of the Prime Minister, assign to himself any

subject or function and may, with like concurrence, determine the Ministries to be

in his charge7

28. Section 51 therein states,

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Constitution, the person holding

office as President on the date of commencement of this Act, so long as he holds

the Office of President may assign to himself the subjects and functions of Defence,

Mahaweli Development and Environment and determine the Ministries to be in his

charge for that purpose and accordingly, any reference in any written law to the

Minister to whom such subject or function is assigned, shall be read and construed as a

reference to the President.8

7 Emphasis added

8 Emphasis added

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 22

29. Section 50 empowered the then President to determine any ministry to be in his charge

with the Prime Ministers concurrence for a period of time starting from the date the Act

came into effect until the next general election. The Act, Nineteenth Amendment to the

Constitution, was certified on 15th May 2015. A General Election was then held on 17th

August 2015. The President at the time was Maithripala Sirisena, the 7th President of Sri

Lanka. The term of the 8th President, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, did not begin till 17th

November 2019.9 That is well after the period contemplated in Section 50 of the

Nineteenth Amendment to the Constriction Act.

30. Section 51 limits its applicability, very clearly, to the President holding office on the date

of the commencement of the Act. As such, only the 7th President, Maithripala Sirisena,

could assign to himselfas he did assign to himselfthe subject of Defence by virtue of

this Section.

31. Clearly, then, neither Section 50 nor Section 51 have any bearing on the instant

application and the impugned Detention Order.

32. It is clear from an overall reading of the constitutional provision relating to the

assignment of ministries that there were no provisions for the President to assign himself

the subject of Defence after the 7th President (during whose tenure the Nineteenth

Amendment came into effect) relinquished officethat is until the Twentieth

Amendment to the Constitution, which was certified on 29th October 2020, came into

effect. Except as provided in Sections 50 and 51, only a Member of Parliament could be

appointed a Minister under the Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

33. The Respondents sought to argue that the President had residual power to assume any

power under any legislation assigned within the purview of the Ministry of Defence,

9 See Gazette Extraordinary No. 2150/41 dated 21st November 2019

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 22

highlighting purported overlays between the functions of the Minister of Defence and

that of the President. The Respondents also highlighted Article 4(b), which states that

the executive power of the People, including the defence of Sri Lanka, shall be

exercised by the President of the Republic elected by the People.10

34. I find this submission unconvincing, for the general reference to the defence of Sri Lanka

in Article 4(b) cannot reasonably be read to mean any and all functions of the Minister

of Defence. It is but a reference to the Presidents role as the Head of State and the

Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.

35. If such loose references to defence can be read to grant residual power to arbitrarily

assume such power and authority given by law to the Minister of Defence, what stops

the President from assuming any governmental power as the Head of State, the Head of

the Executive and of the Government? This submission of the Respondents is not only

unsupported by reason but also democratically precarious.

36. As H.N.J. Perera, C.J. opined in Sampanthan and Others v. Attorney-General and

Others,11

it must be remembered that the President, who is the Head of State under the

Constitution, is but a creature of the Constitution. His powers are only those which

are specifically vested in him by the Constitution and the law. Equally, the exercise

of these powers by the President are circumscribed by the provisions of the

Constitution and the law...

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 22

37. As I noted elsewhere, in Women & Media Collective v. Attorney-General and Others

(Royal Park Pardon Case),12 [i]f ever there was an executive who could do all but turn

a man into a woman and a woman into a man, those days are long gone. As a creature

of the Constitution, the President is strictly bound by its provisions. His powers are that

of the Constitution and its limitations are his own.

38. From the discussion hereinabove, it is apparent that then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa

had no authority to act as the Minister of Defence at the time material to this application

as the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution had not yet come into effect.

39. As such, the issuance of the impugned Detention Order dated 06th February 2020 by then

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is ultra vires the Constitution and therefore devoid of any

legal validity.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13(1) OF THE CONSTITUTION

40. Article 13(1) of the Constitution provides: No person shall be arrested except according

to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for

his arrest.

41. The Petitioner made no grievances known with regard to the arrest itself; and, from the

facts before us, I see no impropriety in taking the Petitioner into custody. While that may

be so, Article 13(1) requires further consideration for the term arrest contemplated

therein means more than what it does colloquially.

42. Common is the mistake where Article 13(1) is seen as concerned only with the instance

of taking one into custody while misinterpreting Article 13(2) as the only provision

concerned with the detention of persons. In truth, Article 13(1) governs both arrests in

12 SC (F/R) Application No. 446/2019, SC Minutes of 06th June 2024, at para 215

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 22

the colloquial sensei.e. the act of taking one into custodyas well as detention, for the

term arrest also contemplates the act of keeping persons contained in a continued state

of custody. In this sense, arrest and detention are greatly overlapping terms. That, in

my view, is why this Court in its earlier wisdom has thought it unnecessary, and perhaps

unwise, to set out a definition for arrest,13 as a narrow and pedantic approach would

greatly restrict this Court in adjudicating those cases that fall in the grey areas.

43. As such, while there are no concerns with respect to the arrest in the instant case, insofar

as taking the Petitioner into custody, the circumstances surrounding the detention of the

Petitioner must be considered with care, especially in the context of my earlier finding

on the legality of the Detention Order dated 06th February 2020.

44. The Petitioner was first detained pursuant to the Detention Order issued by the learned

Magistrate of Panadura in accordance with Section 82(3) of the Poisons, Opium, and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinances which provides that,

The Magistrate may, upon a certificate being filed by a police officer not below the

rank of Superintendent of Police or in his absence the officer acting on his behalf to

the effect that it is necessary to detain such person in custody for the purpose of

investigation, make an order permitting the detention of such person in police

custody for a period not exceeding seven days.

45. This first Detention Order is well-founded in law and its reasonableness can hardly be

questioned considering the amount of Heroin and the number of firearms found in the

Petitioners possession. However, the impugned Detention Order dated 06th February

2020 being unlawful, the detention of the Petitioner pursuant to the said Detention Order

for 12 days from 12th March 2020 to 24th March 2020 becomes ipso facto unlawful.

13 See Mahinda Rajapaksa v. Kudahetti [1992] 2 Sri L.R. 223, at 243

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 22

46. While this may be so, the Respondents sought to argue in their pre-argument written

submissions dated 2nd September 2022 that this Court does not have jurisdiction under

Article 126 to hear and determine the instant application as detention of the Petitioner

was done pursuant to a judicial order.

Not Executive or Administrative Action?

47. The Respondents highlighted that the learned Magistrate of Panadura made the order

dated 12th March 2020 to place the Petitioner in police custody pursuant to the

impugned Detention Order after considering detailed submissions from both parties.

Accordingly, the Respondents argued any alleged infringement of fundamental rights to

be a result of this judicial act which is not amenable to Article 126 jurisdiction.

48. It is true that the learned Magistrate has heard extensive submissions; however, Section

10 of the PTA makes it amply clear that a Magistrate exercises no discretion whatsoever

where a detention order under Section 9 is produced before him.

49. Section 10 of the PTA states that,

An Order made under section 9 shall be final and shall not be called in question in

any proceedings or in any court of law, save and except in proceedings under Article

126, 140 or 141 of the Constitution.

50. I find the views of Fernando, J. in Weerawansa v. Attorney-General and Others14 to be

pertinent in this regard. His Lordship held with reference to Amerasinghe, J. in Farook v.

Raymond:15

14 [2000] 1 Sri L.R. 387, at 419

15 [1996] 1 Sri L.R. 217

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 22

If an officer appointed to perform judicial functions exercised the discretion vested

in him, but did so erroneously, his order would nevertheless be judicial. However,

an order made by such an officer would not be judicial if he had not exercised his

discretion, for example, if he had abdicated his authority, or had acted mechanically,

by simply acceding to or acquiescing in proposals made by the police of which there

was insufficient evidence in that case.

On the other hand, if a judicial officer was required by law to perform some function

in respect of which the law itself had deprived him of any discretion, then his act was

not judicial.

51. As Fernando, J. has noted, where the discretion of a judge is deprived by a statute, as the

PTA does with respect to Section 9 orders thereunder, it cannot be said that such

detention was sanctioned by a judicial act. The Petitioner was not in judicial custody and

it was the executive that had custody of the Petitioner. The detention, therefore, was by

executive and administrative action.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES 13(2) AND 12(1) OF THE CONSTITUTION

52. Article 13(2) provides that [e]very Person held in custody, detained or otherwise deprived

of personal liberty shall be brought before the judge of the nearest competent court

according to procedure established by law and shall not be further held in custody, detained

or deprived or personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of such judge made

in accordance with procedure established by law.16

16 Emphasis added

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 22

53. Whether or not there is a violation of Article 13(2) in a given case is a question

independent from any potential violations of Article 13(1). The ambit of Article 13(2) is

best explained by Amerasinghe J. in Channa Pieris v. Attorney-General:17

. the fact that Article 13(1) is violated does not necessarily mean that Article 13(2)

is therefore violated. Nor does the violation of Article 13(2) necessarily mean that

Article 13(1) is violated. Arrest and detention, as a matter of definition, apart from

other relevant considerations, are "inextricably linked". However, Article 13(1) and

13(2) have a related but separate existence. Article 13(1) is concerned with the

right of a person not to be arrested including the right to be kept arrested

except according to procedure established by law and the right to be informed

of the reasons for arrest, whereas Article 13(2) is concerned with the right of a

person arrested to be produced before a judge according to procedure

established by law and the right not to be further deprived of personal liberty

except upon and in terms of the order of such judge made in accordance with

procedure established by law. Article 13(1) and 13(2) are no doubt linked: For

instance, the procedure under which a person is arrested may determine the period

within which a person has to be produced before a judge. Moreover, as we shall see

the lack of grounds for arrest or subsequent cessation of reasonable grounds might

well be important in deciding whether an obligation arises to produce a person.

Article 13(1) and (2) are linked but not inextricably so.

The fact that Article 13(1) was not violated does not necessarily mean that Article

13(2) cannot be violated. For instance, a person may be arrested on grounds of

reasonable suspicion and given reasons for his arrest. However, if he is not produced

before a judge in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law - and that is the

17 [1994] 1 Sri LR 1

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 22

matter dealt with by Article13(2) - there will be a violation of Article 13(2), although

Article 13(1) was not violated.18

54. One must look at Sections 36, 37 and 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of

1979 (hereinafter CCPA) for the general procedure with regard to detention of a person

arrested without a warrant. However, as the arrest of the Petitioner was made under the

Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, it is the special procedure set out

therein that must be considered.19 Section 82 of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance provides,

(1) The provisions of sections 36, 37 and 38 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.

15 of 1979, shall not apply in relation to persons being suspected or accused of

contravening any provision of Chapter V of this Ordinance.

(2) A police officer making an arrest without a warrant of any person suspected or

accused of committing an offence under Chapter V of this Ordinance, shall without

unnecessary delay and within twenty-four hours of his arrest, produce such person

before a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the case.

(3) The Magistrate may, upon a certificate being filed by a police officer not below the

rank of a Superintendent of Police or in his absence the officer acting on his behalf

to the effect that it is necessary to detain such person in custody for the purpose of

investigation, make an order permitting the detention of such person in police

custody for a period not exceeding seven days.

(4) Upon the conclusion of the investigation or upon the completion of the period of

detention, whichever occurs first, such person shall be produced before the

18 ibid at 98-99 (Emphasis added)

19 See Section 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979

SC/FR/37/2020 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 22

Magistrate and subject to the provisions of section 83 of this Ordinance the

provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, shall apply to and

in relation to such person.

55. Clearly, the facts before us do not reveal any violation of these procedural requirements.

It is amply clear that the Petitioner had been produced before the Magistrate within

twenty-four hours. However, the scope of Article 13(2) is not limited to the right of an

arrestee/detainee to be brought before the nearest competent court in terms of the legal

procedure. The Article also provides that a person so produced before a judge in

accordance with the law shall not be further held in custody, detained or deprived or

personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of such judge made in

accordance with procedure established by law.

56. Additionally, as previously noted, what the Petitioner chiefly challenged before this Court

was the legality of her detention pursuant to the Detention Order dated 06th February

2020 purportedly issued by the Minister of Defence. As concluded earlier in the judgment

the said Detention Order is without a legal basis.

57. Therefore, in view of the aforementioned, I am of the view that the detention of the

Petitioner on the strength of an unlawful detention order is a violation of her rights

guaranteed under Article 13(2) of the Constitution, as she has been denied of her right

not be held in custody, detention or deprived of her persons liberty except upon and in

terms of an order of the judge of the nearest competent court in accordance with the

procedure established by law.

58. Although the learned Magistrate of Panadura has made an order committing the

Petitioner to police custody, that is but a mechanical actnot an exercise of judicial

59. With respect to Article 12(1) of the Constitution, I see no necessity to engage in an

exhaustive discussion. It is now trite law that Article 12(1) encompasses a scope that

extends well beyond the traditional notions of comparative equality and classification.20

It has been conceived as the antithesis of arbitrariness.21 In a consistent line of

jurisprudence, this Court has interpreted Article 12(1) to contemplate the protection of

the Rule of Law itself.22

60. Axiomatically, there is nothing more obnoxious to the Rule of Law than government

officials usurping such power not given to them by law. Especially when such persons

hold the highest of offices.

CONCLUSION AND ORDERS OF THE COURT

61. As such, I find the issuance of the impugned Detention Order dated 06th February 2020

by then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and the detention of the Petitioner pursuant to

the said Order to have violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed

under Articles 13(1), 13(2) and 12(1) of the Constitution.

62. In line with this finding, the State is ordered to pay the Petitioner Rs. 100,000/- as

compensation.

63. This Court cannot, and does not, make any orders vis--vis the former President

personally, as he has not been named as a respondent and was not accordingly afforded

an opportunity to be heard in this case. I also deem it unreasonable to find fault with any

individual officers given the complexity of the questions placed before us.

Application Allowed.
