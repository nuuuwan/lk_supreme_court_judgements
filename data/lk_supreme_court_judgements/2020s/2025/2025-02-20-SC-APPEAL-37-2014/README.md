Samayawardhena, J.

The 1st plaintiff became the owner of Lot 4 in Plan No. 7746 (V1) by a

partition decree. He gifted it to his son, the 3rd plaintiff, subject to the life

interest of himself and his wife, the 2nd plaintiff. Lot 4 is bounded on the

east by the Galle Road, which is about 6 feet higher in elevation than the

plaintiffs land. The western and northern boundaries of Lot 4 are Lots 2

and 3 respectively, which are owned by the defendant. The northern

boundary of Lots 2 and 3 is Vidyala Mawatha. The position of the

plaintiffs is that, due to the higher elevation of the Galle Road, rainwater

collected on Lot 4 was naturally discharged through Lots 2 and 3 into the

municipal drain on Vidyala Mawatha. However, after the defendant

constructed a four-storied building covering Lot 3, rainwater was

redirected and discharged solely through Lot 2. On 13.11.2002 (P6), the

defendant obstructed this flow by constructing a wall along the eastern

boundary of Lot 2, causing rainwater to accumulate on Lot 4. This led to

severe consequences, including flooding and rendering the toilets in Lot

4 unusable.

The plaintiffs filed this action in the District Court of Mount Lavinia on

14.11.2002 seeking in the prayer to the plaint a declaration that they

are entitled to discharge rainwater and sewage waste through Lot 2. They

3

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

also sought an order directing the defendant to remove the wall

constructed along the western boundary of the plaintiffs land (Lot 4),

which obstructed the natural flow of water to Vidyala Mawatha.

The defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action.

After trial, in a brief judgment, the District Judge dismissed the plaintiffs

action stating that all servitudes were extinguished upon the entry of the

Final Decree of Partition and that the plaintiffs had failed to prove the

exercise of such right for a period of 10 years following the decree.

In my view, the District Judge neither understood the case, nor analysed

the facts from the correct perspective. This is evident by the following

paragraph of the District Court judgment.

The Final Decree of Partition entered on 03.04.1991 did not reserve such

a servitude. Section 48(1) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977, invests

partition decrees with finality devoid of encumbrances other than those

specified in the decree. It states, the right, share or interest awarded by

any such decree shall be free from all encumbrances whatsoever other

than those specified in that decree. What is meant by encumbrance is

defined in the Partition Law and according to that definition

encumbrance includes servitudes.

4

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

However, after entering the Final Decree of Partition on 03.04.1991, the

plaintiffs enjoyed this right until the defendant finally constructed the

wall along the eastern boundary of Lot 2 on 13.11.2002. More than 10

years elapsed from the date of the Final Decree of Partition until the

action was filed in the District Court on 14.11.2002, which entitled the

plaintiffs to claim the servitude by prescription.

Although the 1st plaintiff gifted Lot 4 to his son, the 3rd plaintiff, subject

to the life interest of himself and his wife, the 2nd plaintiff, by Deed No.

324 dated 06.07.1999, the 3rd plaintiff can tack on to his possession the

possession of his predecessors. Under Roman law and Roman-Dutch law,

the possession of predecessors in title could be relied upon by a person

who claims a prescriptive title. This principle continues under the

Prescription Ordinance. Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance allows a

party to tack on to his possession the possession of those under whom

he claims to satisfy the required ten-year period of possession. The

requirement under section 3 is proof of the undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession by a defendant in any action, or by those under

whom he claims. As noted by E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in The

Conveyancer and Property Lawyer (1948, Vol. 1, Part 1, page 311): The

possession must be by the party to the action (who is usually the

defendant) or by those under whom he claims; that is by his predecessors

in title.

Therefore, the argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the defendant

that the 3rd plaintiff could not have acquired a prescriptive right as the

required ten-year period was not met, cannot be accepted.

I fail to understand what was meant by the District Judge when he states

that the plaintiffs should have shown a drain () along the

defendants land (Lot 2) for the flow of water. There is no such

requirement. The District Judge states that the defendant became

5

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

entitled to Lots 2 and 3 by the Final Decree of Partition entered in 1991.

This is not correct. By the Final Decree of Partition, the land was

partitioned among the five siblings of the 1st plaintiff, with each receiving

exactly 6.84 perches. The 1st plaintiff was allotted Lot 4. The defendant

purchased Lot 3 by Deed No. 2004 dated 12.01.1993, and Lot 2 by Deed

No. 2051 dated 24.08.1993, from the siblings of the 1st plaintiff. When

the land was partitioned among the siblings, there was no necessity to

discuss about the flow of rainwater. This became an issue only after the

defendant purchased the said Lots and made constructions blocking the

flow of rainwater.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Court, the plaintiffs

appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal of Mount Lavinia. The High

Court in its brief judgment affirmed the judgment of the District Court

on the sole basis that the plaintiff has only made the defendant who is

the proprietor of Lot 2 and have failed to make the proprietor of Lot 5 as a

party to the said action as it is quite obvious that no water from the

plaintiffs land Lot 4 could possibly flow on to the defendants Lot 2 without

it first flowing through Lot 5. This is not factually correct. If I may say

with the risk of repetition, the plaintiffs complaint is that the natural

rainwater flow to Vidyala Mawatha was obstructed by the defendant by

constructing a wall along the eastern boundary of his land, which is Lot

2. The western boundary of the plaintiffs land (Lot 4), is Lot 2. The

northern boundary of Lot 2 is Vidyala Mawatha. Lot 5, which is the

southern boundary of Lot 4, has no connection to Vidyala Mawatha. The

rainwater does not flow from Lot 4 to Lot 2, through Lot 5. The finding of

the High Court that it is quite obvious that no water from the plaintiffs

land Lot 4 could possibly flow on to the defendants Lot 2 without it first

flowing through Lot 5 is completely erroneous. If the learned High Court

Judge looked at the Final Partition Plan 7746 prior to arriving at that

6

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

finding, this would not have happened. He has only looked at the written

submissions to arrive at the said erroneous finding.

The High Court has dedicated the final paragraph of the judgment to

state that the plaintiffs have failed to establish prescriptive title

regarding sewage system through the defendants Lot 2. This finding is

redundant. Although the plaintiffs initially sought to have both rainwater

and sewage waste discharged through the defendants land, in the written

submission filed by the plaintiffs before the High Court on 04.09.2012,

the plaintiffs counsel stated that The appellants confine themselves to

the right to discharge rain water only. This is because, once the rainwater

flows in its natural way, the sewage waste would go to the pit in the

plaintiffs land made for that purpose. The question of disposal of sewage

water arises when the natural water flow is blocked.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the defendant argues that the plaintiff

has not pleaded in the plaint for a servitude. Even assuming it to be so,

it is common ground that both the District Judge and the Judges of the

High Court of Civil Appeal decided the case against the plaintiffs on the

basis that the plaintiffs failed to prove the servitude. The High Court

commenced the judgment by stating that The crux of the matter to be

determined is whether the plaintiffs have proved on a balance of

probability that they are entitled to a servitude right over the defendants

land?. On the other hand, apart from making the said claim as a

servitude, a duty to receive water in such circumstances could still arise

in different ways such as, through prescription, immemorial usage or

statutory authority. Owners of contiguous lots have a corresponding duty

to receive surface water, which arises from the natural situation of the

land.

There is a servitude known to the Roman and Roman-Dutch Law

recognizing the right of the owner of an upper tenement to discharge

7

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

rainwater onto the lower tenement due to natural gravitation, which is

known as ius fluminis. This does not, however, include water diverted by

artificial means, such as water discharged from industrial or commercial

plants.

Walter Pereira, in his celebrated work, The Laws of Ceylon, (2nd edn,

1913), page 403, describes ius fluminis as the right of water-course, to

allow ones water to flow onto the property of another who is bound to lead

it off over to his own land or in a gutter, every one being otherwise, by the

common law, obliged to direct his water onto his own property or conduct

it through his property into the street He further states that lower lands

are said to be naturally subservient to the higher as regards the receiving

of water. So that, ordinarily, the proprietor of higher land is not liable for

injury caused by the flow of water therefrom to lower land. At the same

time, in the absence of a duly acquired servitude the lower proprietor may

by natural free right do anything on his land to keep off water likely to do

him injury, and which flows from land above his; and if the upper

proprietor by artificial means makes the water to flow onto lands lying

lower than his, the lower proprietor may do what he can to prevent the

upper proprietor acquiring a right to do this.

C.G. Hall and E.A. Kellaway, Servitudes (2nd edn, Juta & Co. Ltd., Cape

Town, 1956) at page 85 explain the mode for acquiring the

aforementioned right as follows:

The liability of a lower-lying land to receive water draining from the

property above it, can originate in three different ways; viz:

(a) Owing to its natural situation (natura loci);

(b) By agreement, i.e., servitude (lex), and

(c) By prescription or vetustas.

8

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

Every owner of property is bound to receive the water which

naturally drains onto his property from the land lying on a higher

level than his own (de Villiers v. Galloway, 1943 A.D. 444), nor may

he raise any obstruction on his land whereby the water is dammed

back on the property above him (Retief v. Louw, 4 Buch. at 174;

Ludolph v. Wegner, 6 S.C. 193).

In Fernando v. Fernando (1907) 3 Balasinghams Reports 202, Wood

Renton J. (as he then was) stated at 203:

[B]oth by the Roman and by the Roman-Dutch Law it is incumbent

upon a lower proprietor to receive water flowing down from a higher

ground by laws of natural gravitation and that he is liable to an

upper proprietor for damages if he obstructs the flow. See Maasdorp,

vol. 2, p. 122-123.

A.F.S. Maasdorp, Institutes of Cape Law, Book II (Juta & Co. Ltd., 1903),

pages 122-123, states:

[T]he upper proprietor is entitled to demand that the natural

surroundings of his land and the natural laws to which these are

subject shall be left undisturbed in so far as their continuance is

essential to the proper and reasonable enjoyment of his right of

ownership. And, though the lower proprietor is entitled to demand

that no water or any other substance shall be discharged on to his

ground by the upper proprietor, which would not have come there in

the ordinary course of nature, unless he is bound by some servitude

to receive the same, yet he will be bound to receive water flowing

down to his ground, not in consequence of some act of an upper

proprietor, but in obedience to the natural laws, and if he obstructs

such flow, and damage is thereby caused to the upper proprietor, he

will be liable to an action. On the other hand, the upper proprietor in

9

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

his turn will not be entitled to interfere with the laws of nature

affecting his land or that of his lower neighbour to the injury of the

latter, and will therefore not be allowed to alter the natural drainage

of his ground in such a manner as to discharge or divert water on to

his neighbours ground which would not have flowed there

naturally, or by means of some artificial structures, such as

embankments, watercourses, plantations, and such like, to cause

water, which would have flowed there naturally, to flow down

differently from what it would naturally have done, as, for instance,

in increased volume, or in a more rapid or stronger or more

compressed stream, or in a polluted condition, if injury is thereby

caused to the neighbour. A man is not even allowed to let the rain-

water drip from his roof onto a neighbours ground, unless he has a

servitus stillicidii recipiendi over it, nor may he discharge his rain-

water by means of a down-pipe and spout into his neighbours

property unless he has a servitus fluminis recipiendi over it.

In Marikar v. Rosairo (1912) 15 NLR 507, the trial Court directed the

defendant-appellant to remove the obstruction in the drain leading the

water which flows from the premises of the plaintiff-respondent through

those of the defendant-appellant into the drain on the public road. On

appeal, Lascelles C.J. affirmed the judgment of the trial Court and

declared as follows at 507-508:

[T]here is a good deal of evidence, which is supported by the

personal observation of the Commissioner, to the effect that the level

of the premises of the defendant-appellant is lower than that of the

premises of the plaintiff-respondent, so that, on the principle

explained in Fernando v. Fernando 3 Bal. 202, it is incumbent on the

defendant-appellant to receive the water flowing by gravitation from

the plaintiff-respondents premises. I do not think that it is material

10

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

that the difference in level is small, provided that it is enough to

direct the water from the upper tenement to the lower tenement.

A natural servitude of this nature is, of course, limited in its extent.

The lower proprietor is obliged only to receive such water as flows

in the ordinary course of nature from the upper tenement. He is not

bound to receive water which the upper proprietor has discharged

into his premises by any artificial means which alters the natural

drainage of the land, such as a ditch or channel (Maasdorp, vol. ii.,

p. 172).

In my opinion the judgment of the learned Commissioner can be

supported either on the ground that the plaintiff-respondent has

acquired by prescription a jus fluminis, or on the ground that the

premises of the defendant-appellant are subject to a natural

servitude which obliges the proprietor to receive water flowing

naturally from the plaintiff-respondents premises.

In the instant case, there is uncontroverted evidence that, from the time

the larger land was owned in common by the 1st plaintiff and his siblings,

and for more than 10 years following the partition decree, rainwater

collected in the upper tenement (Lot 4) naturally flowed by gravitation to

the municipal drain on Vidyala Mawatha through the lower tenements

(Lots 2 and 3). The plaintiffs who are the owners of Lot 4 did not discharge

rainwater onto Lots 2 and 3 abutting the Vidyala Mawatha by any

artificial means that altered the natural drainage of the land.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the defendant also argues that a

servitude to divert rain water cannot be claimed when the natural situation

of the land is changed by construction. He cites Hall and Kellaway on

Servitudes, op. cit., page 121, where it is stated When land has been

divided up into building lots and dwellings are erected upon it the natural

11

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

situation is changed, and the owner of an upper lot can no longer claim

that the rain-water which falls on his property shall be permitted to flow

down over lower-lying plots (Bishop v. Humphries 1919 W.L.D. 13).

In the landmark case of Bishop v. Humphries 1919 WLD 13, the Supreme

Court of Appeal of South Africa considered urban development as a

relevant factor in deciding this issue. In Bishops Case, the applicant filed

the case seeking an interdict to restrain the respondent from interfering

with an opening marked A in the fence on the respondents Lot 1450,

which stood between Lot 1450 and the applicants Lot 1451. A portion of

the applicants stormwater flowed southward and discharged into a tank.

When the tank overflowed, the water passed through the opening A onto

Lot 1450. The respondent purchased Lot 1450 from the applicant, who

was also the owner of the adjoining Lots 1449 and 1452.

The Court explained the impracticability of taking this right forward in

its original form (the right of the owner of upper tenement to discharge

stormwater onto the lower tenement based on natural gravitation) at

pages 17-18:

The fact is that when land is sold in small building plots, a state of

things is created and contemplated which puts an end to a large

extent to the natural servitude which previously existed as regards

the water which falls on the plots. Each owner puts up a building

which covers a substantial part of the plot. He places an impervious

surface over the naturally porous surface of the soil. He accumulates

the water thereon. He alters the natural surface of the rest of the

area of his plot by paving it or allocating temporary structures

thereon or digging it up, and thereby annihilates the natural

arrangement of the soil. The rainwater can no longer flow as it used

to flow.

12

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

The principle that a lower property is bound to receive water from an

upper property implies that no person is entitled to interfere with the

natural flow of water by altering its direction, increasing its volume or

force, or concentrating it through the use of any artificial structure. The

Court came to the finding that the applicant was responsible for changing

the natural flow of water:

The Applicant has altered all the old conditions existing on the stand

while it was virgin soil and in a state of nature and it is quite

impossible for him to throw a burden on the adjoining stand which

is based on the assumption that his stand has preserved rights

which he himself has put an end to by his own constructions on the

property.

The Court also observed that the applicant had not taken steps to

minimize the inconvenience caused to the respondent but had

unreasonably insisted on the discharge of stormwater as a matter of

right. This was disapproved by the Court:

As regards the water falling on the roof and entering the tank the

applicant has not resorted to the device adopted on stand 1452 of

making an overflow pipe from the tank to carry the water eastwards

off the stand on to the sanitary passage. This could easily have been

done, but he avoids this small expense and gets rid of the surplus

water through A and claims to be entitled to do this.

On the unique facts of that case, the Court disallowed the applicants

claim. This, in my view, cannot be construed as an authority for the

proposition that a servitude to divert rain water cannot be claimed when

the natural situation of the land is changed by construction.

The facts of the instant case are distinguishable from those of the

Bishops case. In the instant case, the plaintiffs did not make any

13

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

construction that altered the character of the land. They continue to

reside in the ancestral home that existed when the partition case was

filed. The natural flow of water was obstructed only by the defendant,

who erected a high-rise building on Lot 3 and constructed a wall along

the eastern boundary of Lot 2, without making any provision to divert the

rainwater collected on Lot 4 to the municipal drain on Vidyala Mawatha

through his land (Lot 3).

I acknowledge that with urbanization and modern development, the

traditional practice of allowing water to flow onto a neighbours land due

to natural gravitation is no longer feasible or practical. Urban areas are

governed by bylaws regulating the disposal of rainwater, unclean water

and sewage waste. Landowners cannot be expected to limit development

on their land or accommodate such flows merely because their property

is at a lower elevation. Protecting ones property through measures such

as boundary walls is necessary. Thus, the concept of jus fluminis must

evolve to balance the natural flow of water with the rights of landowners

to develop and safeguard their properties, while adhering to urban

planning and environmental regulations.

It is often preferable for matters such as these to be resolved amicably,

as this approach often results in fair and sustainable solutions for both

parties. The documents marked at the trial clearly demonstrate that the

plaintiffs, with the support of the Municipal Council, made genuine

efforts to settle the issue while causing the least possible inconvenience

to the defendant. The plaintiffs are seeking to address basic human

needs, as they are unable to use their toilets due to sewage pits being

inundated by rainwater collected within Lot 4. Despite these efforts, the

defendant remained uncooperative (see P4, P5, P7, P8, P10, and P11).

14

SC/APPEAL/37/2014

The questions of law on which leave to appeal were granted and the

answers thereto are as follows (the first two are by the plaintiffs and the

third is by the defendant):

(a) Did the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal err in law in holding

that the owner of Lot 5 has not been made a party by the appellants

and as such they are not entitled to claim servitudal rights over the

Respondents land?

Yes.

(b) Did the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal err in failing to

appreciate that the appellants rights have been violated by the

Respondent due to a construction of a building on Lot 3 and

construction of a wall on the Western boundary of the appellants

land?

Yes.

(c) Can an Appellant in appeal change the position upon which he

based his claim?

The appellant has not altered his position; he has merely opted not

to pursue one relief on appeal, which he is entitled to do.

The plaintiffs in this case have proved that they are entitled to the reliefs

as prayed for in paragraphs () and () of the prayer to the plaint dated

14.11.2002. The defendant must pay costs of all three Courts to the

plaintiffs.
