"Court came to the finding that the applicant was responsible for changing"
"the natural flow of water:"
"The Applicant has altered all the old conditions existing on the stand"
"while  it  was  virgin  soil  and  in  a  state  of  nature  and  it  is  quite"
"impossible for him to throw a burden on the adjoining stand which"
"is  based  on  the  assumption  that  his  stand  has  preserved  rights"
"which he himself has put an end to by his own constructions on the"
"property."
