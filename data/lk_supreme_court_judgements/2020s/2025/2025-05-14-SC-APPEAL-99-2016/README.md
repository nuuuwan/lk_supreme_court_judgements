Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action instituted in the District Court of Gampaha on

23.05.1972more than fifty years ago. After trial, the judgment dated

29.05.1992 was delivered on 01.06.1992, wherein it was declared that the

plaintiff was entitled to an undivided 2/8 share, the 1st defendant to a 1/8

share, and the 2nd defendant to a 5/8 share of the corpus, which was

identified as Lot 1 in the Preliminary Plan. The appeal preferred by the 2nd

defendant against the said judgment was dismissed by the Court of Appeal

3

SC/APPEAL/99/2016

by judgment dated 12.12.1995. That judgment was read in the District

Court on 01.03.1996. However, no steps were taken by the plaintiff or any

other defendant for 15 years to prosecute the action to finality.

On 26.04.2011, the plaintiff revoked his previous proxy and filed a new

proxy. Thereafter, as recorded in Journal Entry No. 99 dated 26.06.2012,

the Attorney-at-Law for the substituted plaintiff tendered the Interlocutory

Decree and moved that a commission be issued to a surveyor for the

preparation of the Final Partition Plan. The District Judge accordingly

signed the Interlocutory Decree, directed its registration, and issued the

commission. The Registrar of Lands duly registered the Interlocutory Decree

and reported it to Court. However, when the surveyor visited the land on

24.10.2012 to carry out the final survey, the 2(b) defendant objected to it.

The surveyor reported the obstruction to Court, and contempt proceedings

were instituted against the 2(b) defendant.

In the meantime, the Attorney-at-Law for the 2(b) defendant filed a petition

and affidavit dated 12.03.2013, invoking the provisions of section 70 of the

Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977 read with section 839 of the Civil Procedure

Code, seeking to set aside the orders made by Court on 26.12.2012, on the

ground that they were made per incuriam.

The District Court, by its order dated 10.02.2014, refused the said

application, and the High Court of Civil Appeal of Gampaha, by its judgment

dated 16.07.2015, affirmed the order of the District Court. This appeal with

leave obtained is against the judgment of the High Court. Leave to appeal

was granted by this Court primarily on the following two questions of law:

(a) Did the District Court and the High Court err in law by failing to

consider the provisions of section 70(2) of the Partition Law, No. 21 of

1977, in making the impugned orders?

4

SC/APPEAL/99/2016

(b) Are the impugned orders of the District Court and the High Court

contrary to section 337 of the Civil Procedure Code, read with section

79 of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977?

Section 70 of the Partition Law, which deals with the subject of non-

prosecution of partition actions, reads as follows:

70(1) No partition action shall abate by reason of the non-prosecution

thereof, but, if a partition action is not prosecuted with reasonable

diligence after the court has endeavoured to compel the parties to bring

the action to a termination, the court may dismiss the action;

Provided, however, that in a case where a plaintiff fails or neglects to

prosecute a partition action, the court may, by order, permit any

defendant to prosecute that action and may substitute him as a

plaintiff for the purpose and may make such order as to costs as the

court may deem fit.

(2) Any party in a partition action or any person claiming an interest in

the land in respect of which such action has been instituted, may, if no

steps have been taken to prosecute the action for a period of two years,

apply, by way of motion to court, to have such action dismissed, and

the court may dismiss the action if it is satisfied that dismissal is

justified in all the circumstances of the case.

(3) Where the court dismisses an action under this section, it shall

cause a copy of the order of dismissal of the action to be registered at

the Land Registry in the folio in which the lis pendens in the action was

registered, or the continuation thereof.

A dismissal of a partition action for want of prosecution is a rare occurrence.

For practical purposes, all parties in a partition action are plaintiffs. A party

who appears as a defendant today may take steps as a plaintiff tomorrow,

5

SC/APPEAL/99/2016

to prosecute the action to finality. If that party fails to do so with due

diligence, the Court may permit any other defendant to continue the

prosecution of the action. The judgment in a partition action is, in essence,

the result of a collective effort by the plaintiff, the defendants, and the

District Judge.

According to section 70(1) of the Partition Law, where the plaintiff fails to

prosecute the action, the Court is under a duty to make every endeavour to

compel the parties to bring the action to a conclusion by inquiring whether

any of the defendants is willing to assume the role of the plaintiff and

proceed with the case. Only if all such efforts fail, may the Court dismiss

the action.

A District Judge presiding over a partition action should not wait for some

lapse on the part of the plaintiff to dismiss the action and relieve himself of

further responsibility. The intention of the legislature is clear from the

language of the section itself, where the words shall and may are used

purposefully within the section: No partition action shall abate by reason of

the non-prosecution thereof, but, if a partition action is not prosecuted with

reasonable diligence after the court has endeavoured to compel the parties to

bring the action to a termination, the court may dismiss the action.

Although the 2(b) defendant heavily relies on section 70(2), the provisions

of section 70(2) must be read subject to section 70(1), and not in isolation.

Section 70(1) is not confined to the original plaintiff. It applies to any party

whether plaintiff or defendantwho undertakes to prosecute the action. If

such a party fails to take steps for a period of two years, dismissal of the

action is not automatic. In the first place, an application must be made to

Court by a party to the action or by any person claiming an interest in the

land to be partitioned, by way of motion with notice to the other parties.

Upon hearing the parties, the Court may dismiss the action only if it is

satisfied that dismissal is justified in all the circumstances of the case.

6

SC/APPEAL/99/2016

In the present case, the 2(b) defendant made such an application to dismiss

the action after the substituted plaintiff had already taken steps to

prosecute the action, pursuant to which the District Judge had made

orders.

The application made by the 2(b) defendant under section 70 of the Partition

Law read with section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking dismissal of

the action is misconceived in law.

The next question concerns the applicability of section 337 of the Civil

Procedure Code. Section 337 reads as follows:

337. (1) No application (whether it be the first or a subsequent

application) to execute a decree, not being a decree granting an

injunction, shall be granted after the expiration of ten years from

(a) the date of the decree sought to be executed or of the decree, if

any, on appeal affirming the same; or

(b) where the decree or any subsequent order directs the payment

of money or the delivery of property to be made on a specified

date or at recurring periods, the date of the default in making

the payment or delivering the property in respect of which the

applicant seeks to execute decree.

(2) Nothing in this section shall prevent the court from granting an

application for execution of a decree after the expiration of the said term

of ten years, where the judgment-debtor has by fraud or force

prevented the execution of the decree at some time within ten years

immediately before the date of the application.

(3) Subject to the provisions contained in subsection (2), a writ of

execution, if unexecuted, shall remain in force for one year only from

its issue, but

7

SC/APPEAL/99/2016

(a) such writ may at any time, before its expiration, be renewed by

the judgment-creditor for one year from the date of such renewal

and so on from time to time; or

(b) a fresh writ may at any time after the expiration of an earlier

writ be issued,

till satisfaction of the decree is obtained.

The 2(b) defendant contends that, in terms of section 337(1) of the Civil

Procedure Code, a decree cannot be executed after the expiration of a period

of 10 years, but in the instant case, the District Judge ordered execution

upon an application made after a delay of fifteen years.

In terms of section 337(1), no application to execute a decree shall be

granted after the expiry of 10 years from the date of the decree sought to be

executed or of the decree, if any, on appeal affirming the same. As I will

explain below, irrespective of the date on which the decree is signed by the

Judge, unless there has been an appeal against the judgment, the date of

the judgment shall be regarded as the date of the decree for the purpose of

execution. If an appeal has been preferred, the ten-year period shall be

computed from the date of the appellate judgment.

Section 337(1) applies only to an executable decree. An Interlocutory Decree

in a partition action is not an executable decree; it merely determines, inter

alia, the undivided shares of the parties in the corpus. It is only the Final

Decree of Partition that is executable. In the present case, the plaintiff never

sought to execute the Interlocutory Decree.

The 2(b) defendant also finds fault with the entering the Interlocutory

Decree 15 years after the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The entering of

the Decree is a purely ministerial act, and the Interlocutory Decree once

entered relates back to the date of the judgment (Petisingho v. Ratnaweera

(1959) 62 NLR 572, Ariyaratne v. Lapie (1973) 76 NLR 221, Dissanayake v.

8

SC/APPEAL/99/2016

Elisinahamy [1978-79] 2 Sri LR 118, Koralage v. Marikkar Mohomed [1988]

2 Sri LR 299).

The Interlocutory Decree will not be rendered invalid on the ground that it

was not entered and signed by the Judge on the same day the judgment

was delivered. As was held in Fernando v. The Syndicate Boat Company

Limited (1896) 2 NLR 206 The decree in a case is merely the formal

expression of the results arrived at by the judgment, and it is not necessary

that it should be drawn up and signed by the Judge who pronounced the

judgment. That may be done by any Judge of the Court. Vide also Sidoris

Silva v. Palaniappa Chetty (1902) 5 NLR 289.

In terms of section 48, subject to the conditions stated therein, both the

Interlocutory Decree entered under section 26 and the Final Decree of

Partition entered under section 36 are final and conclusive. In other words,

the Interlocutory Decree, although non-executable, does not become invalid

if the action does not proceed to finality.

The argument advanced on behalf of the 2(b) defendant regarding the

applicability of section 337 of the Civil Procedure Code is devoid of merit.

Before I part with this judgment, let me add this for completeness. I had

occasion to consider the question of execution of Final Decree in a partition

action in Bandusena v. Weerasekera and Others (SC/APPEAL/172/2017,

SC Minutes of 30.01.2024), where, after a detailed analysis of the law, I

concluded (with the concurrence of the other two Justices) that, in terms

of section 52 of the Partition Law read with section 337 of the Civil Procedure

Code, an application for delivery of possession in a partition action must be

made within ten years of the date of the final decree of partition, the issuance

of the certificate of sale, or the decree on appeal affirming the same.

I answer the above two questions of law in the negative and the appeal is

dismissed with costs.
