"The  2(b)  defendant  contends  that,  in  terms  of  section  337(1)  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code, a decree cannot be executed after the expiration of a period"
"of 10 years, but in the instant case, the District Judge ordered execution"

"Judge, unless there has been an appeal against the judgment, the date of"
"the judgment shall be regarded as the date of the decree for the purpose of"

"Section 337(1) applies only to an executable decree. An Interlocutory Decree"

"the  Decree  is  a  purely  ministerial  act,  and  the  Interlocutory  Decree  once"
"entered relates back to the date of the judgment (Petisingho v. Ratnaweera"
