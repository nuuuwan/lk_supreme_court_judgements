"SC Appeal No: 61/2013"
"of the partition law and steps taken to safeguard interest of others who are not parties to the"
"action, I think the learned High Court Judges failed to appreciate certain relevant factors in"
"coming to the aforesaid conclusions."
"T
here  are  two  main  factors  that  have  to  be  considered  in  finding  whether  the  learned  High"
"Court Judges erred or not."
"F
irst would be whether the 3rd Defendant who did not challenge the identity of the corpus but"
"claimed prescriptive title to the same can contend the identification of the corpus. The second"
"would be that however, a partition action being an action in rem which binds the whole world,"
"whether the learned High Court Judges were correct in setting aside the learned District Judge’s"
"Judgment on the aforesaid reasons when no one came forward to challenge the identity of the"
"corpus."
"A
s far as the 3rd Defendant is concerned, he in his Statement of Claim did not claim rights to a"
"different land, but claimed prescriptive title against the people who are entitled in terms of the"
"Plaintiff’s  pedigree.  When  one  claims  prescription,  it  is  to  a  specific  and  distinct  land  with"
"definite identification. One cannot claim prescription to an unidentified or unknown land. As"
"per the Statement of Claim it is clear that the prescriptive claim was made to the land in the"
"schedule to the Plaint. No other land has been referred to in the said Statement of Claim and"
"no  other  land  is  described  in  a  schedule.  In  fact,  no  schedule  has  been  included  in  the  said"
"Statement of Claim of the 3rd Respondent. As per Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, one"
"can claim prescription only against a party (plaintiff, defendant, claimant or intervenient in the"
"action) to the action. In various averments in the said Statement of Claim the 3rd Defendant had"
"referred to the subject matter as the ‘land relevant to this action’ and it can be none other than"
"the land in the Plaint. It is true that the 3rd Respondent had got Gurusinghe L.S to survey the"
"said ‘land relevant to the action’ to prepare a plan and referred to it in an averment in the said"
"Statement of Claim, but he has not stated that it is a different land. In fact, in the prayer to the"
"said Statement of Claim, he prayed for a declaration of title to the land described in the Plaint."
"Thus, it is understood that the 3rd Defendant did not or cannot have any identity issue as to the"
"Corpus  of  the  action  which  was  claimed  by  the  Plaintiff  as  a  co-owner  on  a  pedigree  as"
"described in the Plaint. It must be also noted that witness of the 3rd Defendant Gurusinghe L.S"
"also admitted in evidence that the land he surveyed on a commission issued to him as depicted"
"in Plan No. 1296 marked Y is the same land depicted in the Preliminary Plan marked X-vide"
"8"
