"SC Appeal No: 61/2013"
"It must be also noted that any party who wants to get the Preliminary Plan and fields notes"
"verified, they could have moved Court in terms of Section 18(3)(a) of the Partition Law. The"
"3rd Defendant had not taken any step in terms of Section 18(3)(a) of the Partition Law."
"W
ithout taking a position in the Original Court to challenge or object to the identity of the"
"corpus, and while relying on the identity of the corpus to establish his stance of prescriptive"
"title, I do not think the 3rd Defendant could take up new position in appeal before the High"
"Court to say the corpus was not identified. The contents of the learned High Court Judgesâ€™"
"Judgment indicate that this stance taken up by the 3rd Defendant in appeal before them tempted"
"the learned High Court Judges and misled their minds to find that there was no proper identity"
"of the corpus."
"H
owever, a partition action is an action in rem. A Court has to be cautious as there may be"
"collusive attempts to defeat the rights of others who are not parties to the action. Thus, there is"
"a duty on the courts to identify the corpus and to investigate the title relating to that corpus"
"properly before deciding to partition the corpus involved in the action."
"I
n  a  partition  action,  generally  there  are  two  types  of  disputes.  One  with  regard  to  the"
"identification of the corpus and the other regarding the pedigree. Investigation of title basically"
"relates  to  the  pedigree  disputes.  However,  if  there  is  no  proper  identification  of  the  corpus,"
"investigation of title in relation to the subject matter in the partition action becomes futile. The"
"learned Counsel for the 3rd Defendant has cited number of cases to show that in a partition"
"action, proper investigation of title is a must, and it is the incumbent duty of the Trial Judge. I"
"need not refer to them here as there is no disagreement with that proposition of law. However,"
"the  issue  involved  in  the  matter  at  hand  is  whether  there  was  proper  identification  of  land,"
"which  has  to  be  decided  on  the  facts  available  before  the  judge.  It  is  true  that  a  wrong"
"identification of a land may affect parties who are not before the Court."
"I
 have already explained above that there cannot be any dispute as to the identification of the"
"corpus between the Plaintiff and the 3rd Defendant as per the stance taken by the 3rd Defendant"
"at the Trial Court as well as on evidence available before the Trial Court. It is also necessary"
"to see whether the identification of the corpus by the learned District Judge is not sufficient"
"and defective for an action in rem which binds the whole world."
