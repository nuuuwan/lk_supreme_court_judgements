"","he rationale behind the Judgment of the High Court as demonstrated in the said Judgment is"
"set out below;",""
"•","The evidence of the Plaintiff and the Surveyor Boyagoda who prepared the Preliminary"
"","Plan is weak in relation to the identification of the corpus to establish that the land is"
"","properly depicted in the Preliminary Plan marked X. The learned District Judge had not"
"","given due consideration to said evidence."
"•","The learned District Judge has come to his conclusion by comparing the Preliminary"
"","Plan with the Plan made by the Surveyor Gurusinghe on a commission taken by the 3rd"
"","Defendant  and  no  superimposition  has  been  done.  Therefore,  the  said  conclusion  is"
"","defective."
"•","The boundaries of the Corpus have been described as undefined (අ""#ශ්&ත) as per the"
"","Plan made by Surveyor Boyagoda."
"•","As per the evidence of the Surveyor Boyagoda who did the preliminary survey, the only"
"","defined boundary is the road and the Surveyor has not verified the boundaries on his"
"","own and described them in accordance with the Plaint. For example, he has not found"
"","whether there was a ditch of Yakdehiwatte on the North."
"•","The Plaintiff in her evidence had stated that she cannot say the boundaries correctly,"
"","and she had admitted that the boundaries are undefined and there are no fences."
"•","The Plaintiff in evidence had stated that the purpose of the filing of the partition action"
"","was to identify whether the land in the schedule is the land."
"•","The  Plaintiff 
in  her  evidence  admitted 
that 
the  Surveyor  had  not 
identified 
the"
"","boundaries."
"•","Surveyor Gurusinghe who executed the commission for the Defendant had identified"
"","three boundaries as per the schedule to the Plaint, and had stated in evidence that the"
"","eastern boundary, where the road is, is the only boundary which is undefined."
"•","As decided in the Court of Appeal case Dias v Yasatilaka and Others (2005) 3 Sri L"
"","R 169 merely because there was no objection or challenge to the preliminary survey, a"
"","Court  cannot  accept  a  preliminary  survey  plan  without  being  satisfied  as  to  the"
"","correctness of the plan."
