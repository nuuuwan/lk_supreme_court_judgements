"her mother, Leelawathie, had stated that she lived in that address which is No.388/B above and"
"it was the address where the substituted service of the decree was done. Leelawathie had also"
"admitted  that  it  was  the  address  where  the  Appellant  and  the  Respondent  lived  after  their"
"marriage. When it was suggested that on 11.07.2007 the Appellant was residing at that address,"
"she had not stated that it was not but stated she cannot remember. She had stated that there is"
"no  address  with  No.338/B  and  her  daughter,  the  Appellant,  has  no  such  place  with  the"
"No.338/B. However, this witness, Leelawathie, at one place in her evidence had stated that the"
"Grama Niladari changed the addresses recently without referring to any number, but this may"
"be  the  reason  to  use  both  numbers  by  the  Appellant,  as  evinced  by  the  proceedings  in  the"
"maintenance case. It appears, as per the document in the brief, it is not only the Appellant who"
"had used both those numbers to the same address, but also the Respondent who once lived in"
"the same address. He had used both numbers to describe the address of the Appellant – vide"
"the caption in the Plaint of the District Court action which refers to No.388/B as the number of"
"the Appellant’s address and the proxy found at page 95 filed by the Respondent in the District"
"Court, which described the address of the Appellant using No.338/B. Thus, it is clear that both"
"Parties used No.388/B, Nandana Mawatha, Hunupitiya, Wattala, as well as No.338/B, Nandana"
"Mawatha, Hunupitiya, Wattala, to describe the address of the Appellant, and it refers to one"
"and the same. It is the address used by the Appellant as her address throughout the time relevant"
"to the matter at hand."
