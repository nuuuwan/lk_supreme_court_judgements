"High Court Judges to make a finding on that, it was not specifically averred in the Petition nor"
"through any written submissions before the High Court."
"A
s the said process server, Somaratne, had stated in evidence that he did not check the identity"
"card or take the signature of the Appellant, it is argued that the learned High Court Judges erred"
"as they did not consider those facts in coming to their decision. It must be said again that this"
"too  was  not  an  issue  pinpointed  through  their  Petition  or  through  a  written  submission  as"
"agreed, for the learned High Court Judges to make their findings over that. On the other hand,"
"said process server, in his evidence, had stated that when he went to the address, the Appellant"
"identified herself as the relevant person (vide page 67 of the brief) then he served summons."
"He had further stated in evidence, that, after accepting summons, the Appellant closed the door"
"saying that she would not come to Courts- vide page 61 of the brief. This part of his evidence"
"had not been challenged by cross examination at least suggesting that it is a lie. Now it is argued"
"that it is hearsay evidence. I do not think it is correct to say that it is hearsay evidence as it was"
"said before the Court when the Appellant was the opposite party. The Respondent cannot call"
"her to prove that she told that. As said before, that part of the evidence was not challenged."
"Thus,  I  cannot  find  that  the  learned  District  Judge  erred  in  that  finding  by  relying  on  that"
"statement. Anyway, no question of law had been raised to find whether the learned District"
"Judge  erred  in  his  findings  and  now,  this  Court  is  invited  to  find  errors  in  the  High  Court"
"Judgment on issues which were not pinpointed before the High Court."
"I
t  is  also  argued  that  the  fiscal  (process  server),  who  served  summons  personally,  had  no"
"jurisdiction to serve summons in the relevant area when the fiscal, who has jurisdiction to serve"
"summons in the relevant area, had reported he could not find the Defendant at the given address."
"This is a misconceived argument, as any process server can serve summons within the Judicial"
"District  that  belongs  to  the  relevant  District  Court.  Merely  because  the  Registrar  allocates"
"different areas within the Judicial District for each process server for the ease of administration,"
"it does not make serving of summons by a process server in an area allocated to another process"
"server invalid or illegal. Somarathne, who served the summons, as well as Jayanthi Perera, to"
"whom  the  area  where  the  Appellantâ€™s  address  is  allocated,  had  given  evidence  and  had"
"explained why they made such an arrangement to serve the summons through Somaratna. It is"
"explained how the said Jayanthi Perera failed to serve summons. As he is known in the area,"
"there was a possibility of avoiding summons, and thus, they had made arrangements to serve it"
"through Somaratne. Merely because Somaratne admitted in evidence during cross examination"
