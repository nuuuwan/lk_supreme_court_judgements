"SC/APP/26/19"
"attempts to indicate indirectly that the statement contained in the Judgment of the High Court"
"as to the fact that Parties agreed to dispose of the matter before the High Court in that manner"
"is not correct as the matter was fully argued before a different bench vide paragraph 10 of the"
"written submissions dated 28.03.2019. If the matter was fully argued before a different bench"
"and judgment was not delivered for some reason, and again taken up before a new bench it’s a"
"new hearing and it is in that new hearing Parties agreed to dispose of the matter by way of"
"written submissions."
"It is observed that, as per the J.E. dated 16.11.2016, it is recorded that Defendant-Appellant has"
"filed written submissions, and a date is given to file written submissions on the request of the"
"Respondent. However, it appears to be a misstatement, as no copy of such written submissions"
"filed by the Appellant before the High Court has been tendered to this appeal brief and the"
"complete set of journal entries also has not been tendered to show what is stated in the Judgment"
"of the learned High Court Judges as to the non-filing of written submissions is incorrect. It is"
"most likely that the above J.E. dated 16.11.2016 contains a misrepresentation made by the party"
"itself stating that written submissions had been filed. Proceedings relevant to that J.E. has also"
"not been tendered. Thus, the statement in the Appellant’s aforesaid written submissions filed"
"in this Court stating that written submissions was tendered in open court before the High Court"
"is not properly supported by the documents tendered to this Court and available in the brief."
"The best way to show that the learned High Court Judges erred in stating that the Appellant did"
"not tender written submissions is to tender the copy of that written submissions filed in the case"
"record of the High Court or the Journal Entry on the day it was tendered, along with the Petition"
"to this Court. As such, this Court has to rely on what the learned High Court Judges have stated"
"in their Judgment that the Appellant had not tendered written submissions to the High Court"
"even though she agreed to dispose of the appeal before it by way of written submissions."
