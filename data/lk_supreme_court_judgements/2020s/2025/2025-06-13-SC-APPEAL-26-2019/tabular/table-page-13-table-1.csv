"SC/APP/26/19"
"based on a wrong premise, that he did a wrong thing by serving summons in an area allocated"
"to Jayanthi Perera, it does not make the serving of summons illegal or invalid. In suggesting"
"questions of law in paragraph 15 of the Petition, the Appellant had indicated that the learned"
"High Court Judges erred in deciding that said ‘Jayantha’ had given evidence orally to say that"
"he personally handed over summons to the Defendant. Nowhere in their Judgment have the"
"learned High Court Judges referred to said “Jayantha”. The learned High Court Judges have"
"referred to the fiscal who served summons by handing it over to the Defendant in person. As"
"per the evidence before the learned Additional District Judge, it was Somaratna who served"
"summons by personal service, and it was not Jayanthi Perera who did that. In the Petition, in"
"the same paragraph, the Appellant had taken up the position that the learned High Court Judges"
"gravely erred in deciding that ‘when the order was made to serve by substituted service the"
"Defendant appeared in court to support a motion’. That statement of the learned High Court"
"Judges has to be understood in the context it was made. The learned High Court Judges had"
"mentioned how the nisi order was returned when it was issued to serve by personal service,"
"thereafter,  it  has  stated  that  when  the  order  was  made  to  serve  by  substituted  service  the"
"Defendant appeared in court to support a motion, as alleged by the Appellant. What the learned"
"High Court Judges appears to have meant, was that when it was issued to be served by personal"
"service, it became a failure, but once the order was made and served by substituted service, the"
"Appellant appeared and supported the motion. As per the evidence led, it is factually correct"
"that the Appellant first came to court to support the motion filed along with her application to"
"purge the default after serving of the ex parte decree by substituted service- vide J.E. No. 11"
"and 12 at pages 24 and 25 of the brief. Thus, the appearance of the Appellant was after it was"
"ordered to serve the decree by substituted service. It is understood that the High Court Judges"
"had referred to ex parte decree as the ‘order or nisi order’ in their Judgment."
