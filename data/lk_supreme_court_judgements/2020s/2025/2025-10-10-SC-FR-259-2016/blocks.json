    "text": "Respondent is the Honourable Attorney General. The Petitioner claims that he had been an omni bus operator and had owned two buses plying between Colombo and Kottawa. The Petitioner claims that on 09.07.2016 in the evening when he had been returning home from a friend\u2019s place around 10.00 pm, he had seen his two buses parked after the days running and had met the 2nd Respondent along with another police officer, who had abused the Petitioner in filth. The 2nd Respondent had proceeded to aim his pistol at his head and had threatened to kill him. At that point the 2nd Respondent had got down the 4th and 5th Respondents to the scene. Thereafter, according to him, the 4th and 5th Respondents had slapped him and asked him to kneel down. According to the Petitioner, the 2nd, 4th and 5th Respondents have continued to assault him brutally inside his own bus. Thereafter, the 3rd Respondent had arrived at the scene and continued to assault him. Although his family members had pleaded with the Respondents to stop assaulting him, it had not happened. Instead, he had been taken to the Kottawa police station and had been assaulted by the 1st Respondent and had been put inside a cell with his friend. The eye-witnesses of the incident are the Petitioner\u2019s wife, Priyal Prasantha (his brother-in-law), and Petitioner\u2019s mother. The Petitioner has alleged that he was bleeding from his face, mouth, chest, hands and legs due to the assault by the 1st to 5th Respondents. Thereafter, on 10.07.2016 at 2.30 pm he had been produced before the Magistrate of Homagama for the alleged offence of possessing 550 mgs of heroin. He completely denies this allegation. His Attorney at Law had informed court with regard to his alleged assault and injuries and, thereafter, the Magistrate had ordered for the Petitioner to be produced before the judicial medical officer of Colombo and remanded him till 18.07.2016. However, the Petitioner claims that he was never placed before a JMO and when this case was called on 18.07.2016 the Magistrate had been duly informed and the Magistrate had summoned the JMO of Homagama base hospital. Thereafter, the magistrate had ordered this matter to be investigated by the SSP of the Nugegoda division. The said JMO summoned by court had produced a medical report marked as P7, where injuries to his eyes, face, chest and forearms have been observed. The Petitioner claims that his allegation of assault by the 1st to 6th Respondents had been established by the report. Further, he denies the allegation of being in possession of heroin at the time of the arrest. The issue as to whether the Petitioner\u2019s fundamental rights guaranteed under",

However, the Petitioner claims that another individual was presented to the medical examination, instead of him. In examining the affidavits placed before this Court, the affidavit of Mrs. Shanthi Priya, the wife of the Petitioner, states that she witnessed the Petitioner being forced into a bus and thereafter, being brutally assaulted by police officers. Similarly, the affidavit of Dinesh Priyankara, a neighbour, corroborates this, stating that he observed the Petitioner being handcuffed and assaulted by police officers and was taken to the Police jeep. Further affidavits filed by Janaka Kumara, Dilan Priyankara, and Piyal Prashantha, who are neighbours of the Petitioner, established that the Petitioner had an argument with the police officers and was thereafter assaulted inside the bus while being handcuffed. Both Janaka Kumara and Piyal Prashantha, in their affidavits, specifically claim that the Petitioner was bleeding from his mouth. Piyal Prashantha, along with his friend, proceeded to the police station after the incident. Piyal further states in his affidavit that he had overheard an attempt by the police to falsely implicate the Petitioner on a drug offence. He inquired on this matter with Upali Senaratne, Attorney at Law. Even though, he has asked the OIC to file a case for obstructing police duty, a drug case was filed. He further claimed that T.V. Priyantha, who was arrested alongside the Petitioner, was released the next day. The affidavits disclose a consistent and corroborative narrative, namely that the Petitioner, while restrained in handcuffs, was subjected to physical assault by police officers inside a bus, resulting in visible injuries and that there was a subsequent attempt by the police to mischaracterize the events through improper charges. Affidavits were filed by Joseph Shantha Kumara and Rohana Sudath Liyanage to substantiate the position of the Respondents. The affidavit filed by Joseph Shantha Kumara state that he was in the custody of the Kottawa Police Station from 09.07.2016 to 10.07.2016 and during that period no suspect was subjected to assault by the police. Likewise, the affidavit filed by Rohana states that he was present at the Police Station on 09.07.2016 until 1.00 p.m. and during that time he observed two police officers in uniform placing a handcuffed person inside the cell, but specifically notes that neither the OIC nor the police officers assaulted any suspects while he was there. However, both affidavits do not negate the position of the Petitioner, who claims he was subject to assault, not only at the police station, but prior to reaching the police station as well, and had sworn affidavits by 5 individuals present at the time substantiating his position.",

The facts and the corroborative evidence abovementioned, especially the second JMO report and the affidavits filed indicate that the Petitioner was subjected to physical assault of a profound nature and degrading treatment. Such conduct falls squarely within the prohibition under Article 11. Additionally, the Petitioner contends that his rights under Article 12(1) were violated when the 1st to 6th Respondents produced him before court based on false allegations, and further violated the said Article by failing to present him to the JMO.

The conduct of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents in brutally assaulting the Petitioner amounts to torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, thereby constituting a clear violation of Article 11 of the Constitution. The failure to produce the petitioner before a JMO constitutes a breach of procedural safeguards and amounts to a violation of the Petitioner\u2019s right to equal protection of the law under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Furthermore, the inaction of the other officers in preventing the assault reinforces this violation, as their omission reflects a disregard for the Petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights. The arrest and detention without properly informing the Petitioner of the reasons for his arrest also violate Article 13(1) of the Constitution. Accordingly, I hold that the Petitioner has successfully established that his fundamental rights under Articles 11, 12(1) and 13(1) have been infringed by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents, and that the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 6th Respondents bear responsibility for their failure to prevent or rectify such violations. The application for a declaration that the Petitioner\u2019s fundamental rights under Article 11, 12(1) and 13(1) were violated by the 1st to the 6th Respondents is made and this Court further orders compensation in the sum of Rs 1,000,000 is awarded to the Petitioner, to be paid jointly by the 1st to 6th Respondents from their personal funds, for the reason that they were directly involved in the assault.",
