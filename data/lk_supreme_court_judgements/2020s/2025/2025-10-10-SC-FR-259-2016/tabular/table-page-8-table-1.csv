"I
n Dissanayaka v Superintendent Mahara Prison and others, Kulatunga, J."
"stated the following to highlight the importance of examining the material to decide"
"the validity of the arrest."
"â€œNevertheless,  it  is  for  the  Court  to  determine  the  validity  of  the  arrest"
"objectively. The Court will not surrender its judgement to the executive for if"
"it did so, the fundamental right to freedom from arbitrary arrest secured by"
"Article 13(1) of the Constitution will be defeated. The executive must place"
"sufficient material before the Court to enable the Court to make a decision,"
"such  as  the notes of investigation,  including  the statements of witnesses,"
"observations etc. without relying on bare statements in affidavits""."
