"In  the  case  of  Mrs.  W.  M.  K.  De  Silva  v  Chairman,  Ceylon  Fertilizer"
"Corporation,  it  was  held  that  for  there  to  be  an  Article  11  infringement,  the"
"degree of mental or physical coerciveness or viciousness must go beyond mere"
"ill-treatment and amount to maltreatment of a high degree."
"T
he facts and the corroborative evidence abovementioned, especially the second"
"JMO report and the affidavits filed indicate that the Petitioner was subjected to"
"physical assault of a profound nature and degrading treatment. Such conduct"
"falls squarely within the prohibition under Article 11."
"A
dditionally,  the  Petitioner  contends  that  his  rights  under  Article  12(1)  were"
"violated  when  the  1st  to  6th  Respondents  produced  him  before  court  based  on"
"false allegations, and further violated the said Article by failing to present him to"
"the JMO."
