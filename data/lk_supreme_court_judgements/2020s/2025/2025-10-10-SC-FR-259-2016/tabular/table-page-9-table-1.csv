"arrest."
"I
n conclusion, having considered the totality of the evidence, it is evident that"
"the Petitioner was subjected to physical assault and degrading treatment. The"
"conduct  of  the  2nd  and  3rd  Respondents  in  brutally  assaulting  the  Petitioner"
"amounts  to  torture  and  cruel,  inhuman,  and  degrading  treatment,  thereby"
"constituting a clear violation of Article 11 of the Constitution."
"T
he  failure  to  produce  the  petitioner  before  a  JMO  constitutes  a  breach  of"
"procedural  safeguards  and  amounts  to  a  violation  of  the  Petitioner’s  right  to"
"equal protection of the law under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Furthermore,"
"the  inaction  of  the  other  officers  in  preventing  the  assault  reinforces  this"
"violation, as their omission reflects a disregard for the Petitioner’s constitutional"
"rights."
"T
he arrest and detention without properly informing the Petitioner of the reasons"
"for his arrest also violate Article 13(1) of the Constitution."
"A
ccordingly,  I  hold  that  the  Petitioner  has  successfully  established  that  his"
"fundamental rights under Articles 11, 12(1) and 13(1) have been infringed by the"
"2nd  and  3rd  Respondents,  and  that  the  1st,  4th,  5th,  and  6th  Respondents  bear"
"responsibility for their failure to prevent or rectify such violations."
"T
he application for a declaration that the Petitioner’s fundamental rights under"
"Article 11, 12(1) and 13(1) were violated by the 1st to the 6th Respondents is made"
"and  this  Court  further  orders  compensation  in  the  sum  of  Rs  1,000,000  is"
"awarded to the Petitioner, to be paid jointly by the 1st to 6th Respondents from"
"their  personal  funds,  for  the  reason  that  they  were  directly  involved  in  the"
"assault."
