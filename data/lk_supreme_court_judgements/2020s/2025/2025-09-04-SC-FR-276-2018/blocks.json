The record reflects that the 1st and 2nd Respondents acted out of the scope of their lawful authority by making an application seeking further directions from the Learned Magistrate against the Petitioner, suppressing the directions given by the National Police Commission and by continuing to summon the Petitioner to the Thihagoda police and Mediation Board despite the directions given by the National Police Commission. The Petitioner states that these actions are unreasonable, capricious, which amounts to a violation of Fundamental Rights.",
