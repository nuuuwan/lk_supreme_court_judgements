"In Wijerathna v Sri Lanka Ports Authority [2020] SC (FR) Application No."
"256/2017 - SC Minutes 11.12.2020, Justice Kodagoda explains the concept of"
"equality as provided within Article 12(1) as follows:"
"“The concept of ‘equality’ was originally aimed at preventing discrimination"
"based on or due to such immutable and acquired characteristics, which do"
"not on their own make human being unequal. It is now well accepted that,"
"the ‘right to equality’ covers a much wider area, aimed at preventing other"
"‘injustices’  too,  that  are  recognized  by  law.  Equality  is  now  a  right  as"
"opposed to a mere privilege or an entitlement.”"
