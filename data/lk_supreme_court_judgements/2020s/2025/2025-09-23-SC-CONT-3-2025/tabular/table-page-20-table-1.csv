"32. It  is  thus  clear  that,  willful  disobedience  of  an  order  issued  by  this  Court  with  the"
"intention  of  (a)  bringing  the  authority  of  court  into  disrespect  or  disregard,  or  (b)"
"interfering with or causing grave prejudice to the judicial process in relation to any"
"ongoing or concluded litigation, amounts to contempt of court."
"33. The jurisdiction and power vested in courts to deal with instances of contempt of court"
"is a means of providing a mechanism for courts to themselves maintain the efficacy"
"and  the 
independence  of  courts.  It 
is 
important  to  also  note  that  considerable"
"flexibility  has  been  vested  in  courts  to  exercise  discretionary  authority  over  the"
"procedure  to  be  followed  in  the  determination  of  whether  an  alleged  instance  of"
"contemptuous behaviour  in fact amounts to  contempt of court, and should a  court"
"arrive  at  a  finding  that  the  accused  person  has  committed  contempt  of  court,  the"
"punishment to be imposed."
"34. While  Article  105(3)  of  the  Constitution  has  vested 
in  the  Supreme  Court  the"
"jurisdiction  and  power  to  punish  for  contempt  of  itself,  whether  committed  in  the"
"precincts of the Court or elsewhere, the same Article has vested power in the Court of"
"Appeal to punish for contempt of such court or any other court, tribunal or institution"
"referred 
to 
in  paragraph 
(1)(c)  of  Article  105(1)  of 
the  Constitution,  whether"
"committed in the presence of such court, tribunal or institution, or elsewhere. Section"
"18  of  the  Judicature  Act  has  vested  jurisdiction  in  the  High  Court  to  deal  with"
"instances of contempt of such court committed against or in disrespect of its authority."
"Similarly, section 55 of the Judicature Act has vested jurisdiction in District Courts,"
"Small Claims Courts and Magistrates courts to punish instances of contempt of court"
"committed in the presence of such court."
"35. In this matter, it would not be necessary to determine whether the Accused had in fact"
"committed  (proof  of  commission)  the  act  of  disobedience  impugned  by  the  three"
"Petitioners (namely, non-compliance with the 4th interim order issued by this Court"
"on 2nd August 2024 in SC FR Nos. 203, 204, and 205 / 2024) and if so, whether such"
"conduct would amount to contempt of court (as defined and provided for in sections"
"3(1) read with 3(2) of Act No. 8 of 2024). That is because the Accused pleaded “guilty”"
"to the charge of contempt of court contained in the Rule served on him."
