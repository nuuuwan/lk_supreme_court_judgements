"1.  The  three  Petitioners,  Mr.  M.A.  Sumanthiran,  PC,  Hon.  Abdul  Rauff  Hibbathul",""
"Hakeem,  MP,  and  Hon.  Achchige  Patali  Champika  Ranawaka,  MP  filed","three"
"","Fundamental  Rights Applications, Nos. 203, 204, and 205 / 2024, stating that these"
"","Applications were being filed in public interest. They alleged that decisions taken on"
"","11th September 2023 and 11th December 2023 by the Cabinet of Ministers constituted"
"an 
infringement  of  Fundamental  rights  guaranteed  under  Article  12(1)  of","the"
"","Constitution. The Petitioners complained to this Court that a decision taken to award"
"","a contract to a certain company to carry out ‘E-visa consular services, visa services,"
"","biometric services and tourism promotion’ was unlawful, corrupt and therefore, was"
"","an infringement of their Fundamental rights. As at the time the three Petitions were"
"","filed, the implementation of that contract had commenced and thus, with effect from"
"","16.04.2024, the ‘ETA system’ that was in force for a considerable period of time had"
"","been  terminated,  and  in  its  place  an  ‘E-visa  system’  had  been  introduced  and  was"
"being 
implemented.  While 
the  Petitioners  were  not  averse 
in  principle","to 
the"
"","conversion from one system to the other, they impugned the award of the contract to"
"","the implementing party and its terms and conditions. The Petitioners were concerned"
"about the impact of the new scheme on tourism and the loss of revenue to the State.",""
