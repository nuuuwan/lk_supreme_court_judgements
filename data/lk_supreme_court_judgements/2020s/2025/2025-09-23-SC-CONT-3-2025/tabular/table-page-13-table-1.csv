"16. The Court also heard the views of the Petitioners Hon. Rauff Hakeem, MP and Hon."
"Patali Champika Ranawaka, MP. Mr. M.A. Sumanthiran, PC was not present in Court,"
"and  he  had,  on  the  previous  day,  sought  that  his  absence  be  excused.  Both  Hon."
"Hakeem and Hon. Ranawaka invited the Court to view this matter seriously. They"
"submitted that the approach of the Accused should have been to first comply with all"
"four  interim  orders,  and  then,  if  necessary,  complain  or  seek  a  variation.  They"
"highlighted  that,  due  to  the  conduct  of  the  Accused,  there  had  been  delay  in  the"
"implementation of the 4th interim order made by Court. Hon. Hakeem submitted that"
"the delay in implementing the 4th interim order had caused a serious impact to the"
"tourism industry of this country. Hon. Ranawaka submitted that the instance of non-"
"compliance  with  the  order  of  Court  cannot  be  viewed  in  isolation  and  should  be"
"viewed in the backdrop of the several incidents brought to the attention of Court in"
"the related Fundamental Rights Applications. He stated that the reasons submitted"
"for  seeking  time  to  implement  the  4th  interim  order  of  Court  were  false,  since"
"following  the  Court  having  taken  action  against  the  Accused,  the  4th  interim  order"
"was  promptly  given  effect  to  within  24  hours.  He  submitted  that  the  delay  in  the"
"implementation of the 4th interim order had cost the State a large sum of money."
