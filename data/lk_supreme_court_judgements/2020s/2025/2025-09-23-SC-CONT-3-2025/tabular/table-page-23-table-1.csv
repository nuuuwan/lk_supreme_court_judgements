"not exceeding rupees three hundred thousand or to simple imprisonment for a period"
"not exceeding one year or both. In the Special Determination of the Supreme Court"
"with  regard  to  the  Contempt  of  a  Court,  Tribunal  or  Institution  Bill  [SC/SD  58  -"
"62/2023], the Supreme Court having considered multiple Constitutional implications"
"arising out of this Clause, determined that Clause 11 as a whole was inconsistent with"
"the  provisions  of  Article  12(1)  of  the  Constitution.  In  these  circumstances,  it  is"
"apparent  that  when  enacting  the  Bill,  the  Parliament  had  removed  that  Clause."
"Therefore,  as  the  law  stands  today,  Act  No.  8  of  2024  does  not  provide  for  any"
"restriction on the nature or extent of the punishment that may be imposed on a person"
"found  “guilty”  of  having  committed  contempt  of  court.  On  a  consideration  of  a"
"multitude of factors, this Court  has formed the  assumption that  additional reasons"
"which  justify  why  there  should  not  be  any  restriction  placed  in  Court  are  that;  (a)"
"Article 105(3) which concurrently confers jurisdiction on the Supreme Court and the"
"Court  of  Appeal  to  deal  with  instances  of  contempt  of  court,  does  not  impose  any"
"restriction on the punishment that may be imposed on a person who has been found"
"“guilty”  of  having  committed  contempt  of  court,  and  (b)  the  very  nature  of  the"
"circumstances  that  constitutes  contempt  of  court  are  so  varied  and  its  impact  and"
"consequences can range from being minor to extremely serious, there can be certain"
"instances of contempt of court which warrants in public interest the imposition of a"
"very high (severe) punishment."
