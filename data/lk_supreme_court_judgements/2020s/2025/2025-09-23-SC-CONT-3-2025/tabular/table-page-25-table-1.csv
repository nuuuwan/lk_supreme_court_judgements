"49. Based on the afore-stated hypothetical upper limit, I fix the mid-point of the term of"
"imprisonment  at  three  and  a  half  (3  Â½)  years.  When  computing  the  sentence  to  be"
"imposed, I propose to use this mid-point as the starting point. Thereafter, I increase"
"the  sentence  to  be  imposed  from  that  mid-point  in  consideration  for  each  of  the"
"aggravating factors and reduce from that elevated sentence for the several mitigatory"
"factors. This is done while attaching different weights to each of those factors, as their"
"significance varies from one to the other."
