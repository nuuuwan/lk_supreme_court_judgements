"28. While  the  written  law  of  this  country  has  since  1801  recognised  the  offence  of"
"contempt  of  court,  till  the  enactment  of  the  Contempt  of  a  Court,  Tribunal  or"
"Institution Act, No. 8 of 2024, its definition remained in the realm of the common law."
"Therefore,  during  the pre-2024 era, it was necessary to have recourse to a series of"
"judgments  of  superior  courts,  including  In  the  matter  of  the  Application  of  John"
"Ferguson for a Writ of Prohibition against the District Judge of Colombo  [(1874) 1"
"NLR 181], Kandoluwe Sumangala v. Mapitigama Dharmarakitta et al. [(1908) 11 NLR"
"195], In the Matter of Armand De Souza, Editor of the Ceylon Morning Leader [(1914)"
"18 NLR 33], In the matter of a Rule under section 51 of the Courts Ordinance on H.A.J."
"Hulugalle, Editor, “Ceylon Daily News” [39 NLR 294], Reginald Perera v. The King"
"[52 NLR 293], Regent International Hotels LTD. v. Cyril Gardiner and Others [(1978-"
"79-80)  1  Sri  L.R.  278],  Hewamanne  v.  De  Silva  and  Another  [(1983)  1  Sri  L.R.  1],"
"Dayawathie and Peiris v. Dr. S.D.M. Fernando and Others [(1988) 2 Sri L.R. 314], and"
"Jung  Kim  and  Another  v.  Jayasinghe  [(2021)  3  Sri.  L.R.  91]  to  determine  whether  a"
"particular instance of impugned conduct amounted to contempt of court. The need to"
"do so has changed to a considerable extent with the enactment of the Act  No. 8 of"
"2024."
