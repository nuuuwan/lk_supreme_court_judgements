"The impugned Judgement"
"The  docket  bears  out  that  the  trial  in  the  instant  case  has  gone  on  for  almost  a  decade,"
"consequent to recording of 14 admissions and 40 issues."
"Whilst  two  Directors  and  an  officer  from  Registrar  of  Companies  had  given  evidence  on"
"behalf of the Plaintiff and marked 31 documents, a Director and a former Director of the Department"
"of Public Enterprises had given evidence on behalf of the State and marked 16 documents."
"The impugned judgement consists of 32 pages. Pages one to twenty refer to the pleadings,"
"admissions and the forty issues and the answers given to such issues by the learned judge of the High"
"Court. Pages twenty to thirty summarize the evidence of the aforesaid witnesses."
"This leaves only three pages for the learned judge to examine and analyse the evidence led,"
"and the relevant laws in the light of the complex legal ramifications revolved around the forty issues."
"In  my  view,  the  judgement  is  devoid  of  critical  analysis  and  examination  of  the  complex"
"provisions of the law. The acquisitions, the mergers, the responsibilities of the shareholders, and the"
"Directors,  the  obligations  of  the  State,  especially  in  matters  relating  to  Conversion  of  Public"
"Corporations or Government Owned Business Undertakings into Public Companies have not been"
"considered, examined or dealt with in this judgement."
"Similarly, the issues pertaining to legal consequences, for example issue bearing number 36,"
"the provisions pertaining to maintainability of the action in terms of the Civil Procedure Code has"
"not been answered by the learned judge. The issue bearing number 37 pertaining to prescription has"
"been answered in the negative, without any examination or consideration of the facts and/or the law"
"whatsoever.  Also  no  reasons  have  been  given  in  the  judgement  for  answering  the  said  issue"
"pertaining to prescription in the negative."
"The facts related earlier in this judgement envisage, that the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant,"
"were  established  as  public  companies  way  back  in  1989  and  1993.  The  Plaintiff  was  thereafter"
"privatized in April 1993. However, the Plaintiff resorted to legal action, by filing this plaint only in"
"November  2000  i.e.,  seven  years  after  privatization  and  in  my  view,  the  issue  pertaining  to"
"prescription, in the said light is material and should have been considered in detail, which the learned"
"judge has failed to do, and such failure amounts to a fatality."
"Similarly, the answer to issue bearing number 38, in relation to Sections 23 and 24 of the"
"Interpretation Ordinance is a mere ‘not applicable’, without an iota of reasoning and/or evaluation"
"in the impugned judgement."
"Another significant factor that is seen when perusing the plaint is, that the Plaintiff appears"
"to  base  its  cause  of  action  on  a  purported  discussion  said  to  have  been  initiated  by  the  Director"
"General  of  the  Department  of  Public  Enterprises  in  1996.  Whilst  the  said  discussion  has  been"
"prompted by the alleged representations made by a shareholder of National Insurance Corporation,"
"viz.,  Ceylon  Shipping  Corporation,  the  1st  Defendant  has  specifically  taken  up  the  position  in  its"
"answer, that the actions and/or acknowledgements made by the Director General of Department of"
"Public  Enterprises,  cannot  and  do  not  bind  the  affairs  of  the  State.  This  issue  too  has  not  been"
"examined nor considered by the learned High Court Judge."
