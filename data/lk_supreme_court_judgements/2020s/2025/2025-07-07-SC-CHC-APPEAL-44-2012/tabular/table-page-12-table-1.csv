"predecessors  of  Acland  Insurance  (the  Plaintiff)  and  /  or  NIC  Limited  (the  2nd  Defendant),  the"
"predecessors being the Acland Finance and Insurance Limited and National Insurance Corporation."
"Similarly,  the  Secretary  to  the  Treasury  and  /  or  the  State  too  did  not  have  any  assets,"
"liabilities or obligations left with them, at the time of the conversion, thus having a nil balance."
"All  assets,  liabilities  or  obligations  passed  on  to  the  newly  formed  entities,  the  public"
"companies. However, in the newly formed entities all the shares were freshly allotted to the Secretary"
"to the Treasury for and on behalf of the State. The Secretary to the Treasury, was to hold those shares"
"until the public companies were privatized."
"Both these entities, Acland Insurance and NIC Limited were privatized by sale of all shares."
"Incidentally, both these entities were purchased by P & I Insurance Brokers Private Limited but at"
"different points of time, viz., in the years 1993 and 2001. The consideration paid for said transactions"
"were termed ‘full and final settlements’. Both these entities are now limited liability companies and"
"are  carrying  on  the  insurance  business,  the  Plaintiff  in  its  own  name,  Acland  Insurance  Services"
"Limited and the 2nd Defendant, presently under the name, style and business of Janashakthi Insurance"
"Company Ltd, the 2A Defendant-Respondent."
"The evidence led at the trial reveals, that the aforesaid position has been accepted as correct"
"by the two witnesses, Chandra Schaffter and Prakash Schaffter who gave evidence on behalf of the"
"Plaintiff. The witnesses for the State, the Director General of the Department of Public Enterprises"
"and the former Director General Mr. Arumugam explained the procedure of transfer of shares in"
"great detail. The said witnesses have categorically stated at the time of conversion, the new owners"
"had  the  right  to  look  into  the  books  of  accounts  and  balance  sheets,  to  ascertain  the  contributed"
"capital which stood at 100% and which was converted into the equity share capital."
"Moreover, the witnesses for the Plaintiff, admitted that they were well aware of the process"
"of  conversion  in  1993  and  even  enjoyed  the  dividend  for  a  few  years  but  only  challenged  such"
"procedure, when the shares of the National Insurance Corporation Limited (NIC Limited) were put-"
"up  for  sale  in  the  year  2001  which  were  ultimately  bought  over  by  a  company  where  the  said"
"witnesses themselves were the directors and shareholders."
"From the above, it is evident that the Plaintiff did not challenge the statement of accounts at"
"any point of time. The Plaintiff accepted, that the initial capital invested and / or contributed by the"
"State to the National Insurance Corporation, was thereafter converted to equity capital i.e., when the"
"National Insurance Corporation Limited (NIC Limited) was established. Hence, nothing was left for"
"the State, leaving only a zero balance."
"In order to recapitulate, I wish to state that the initial investment  for the establishment of"
"National Insurance Corporation was by the State and by three State owned entities, namely Ceylon"
"Shipping Corporation, Sri Lanka Export Credit Corporation and Acland Insurance Services Limited."
"All the three entitles, being fully state owned were under the purview of the Ministry of Trade. The"
"National  Insurance  Corporation  too,  came  under  the  Ministry  of  Trade.  The  initial  investment"
"contributed by the State and the three State entities in 1981 was thereafter converted into the equity"
"capital, when National Insurance Corporation was established in February 1993."
