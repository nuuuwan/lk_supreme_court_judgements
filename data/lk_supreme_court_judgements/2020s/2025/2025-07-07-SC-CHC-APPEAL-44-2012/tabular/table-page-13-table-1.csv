"Hence, it was strenuously contended by the Appellants, that by operation of the Conversion"
"Act and the establishment of the National Insurance Corporation Limited by virtue of the Companies"
"Act No. 17 of 1982, whatever the investments the State and its entities had, were converted to equity"
"shares. When privatization of the said company i.e., NIC Limited took place, the full contingent of"
"shares viz., 100% were put up for sale, which was purchased by P & I Insurance Brokers Private"
"Limited. It is noted that the words used in the said transaction was ‘full and final settlement’. The"
"Appellant therefore argued, that the Appellant has no liability whatsoever to pay the Plaintiff, since"
"a full and final settlement was arrived at when NIC Limited was privatized and the ownership was"
"transferred to P & I Insurance Brokers Private Limited."
"It is further noted that when the plaint was filed in the year 2000, many reliefs were claimed"
"including declarations, enjoining orders, interim injunctions and permanent injunctions for sale of"
"6%  shares  at  privatization.  Thereafter  the  privatization  took  place  and  the  ownership  changed  as"
"stated earlier in the judgement. Thus, the Plaintiff restricted its claim to prayer (f) only i.e., payment"
"for shares said to be 6% value of the share capital of NIC Limited."
"Contradicting the said submission of the Appellants, the Plaintiff strenuously argued that the"
"Appellant is vacillating and has failed to produce material and documents to prove that a payment"
"was made by the State for the shares held by the Acland Finance and Insurance Limited in National"
"Insurance Corporation."
"The Plaintiff’s contention is that the 10,000 shares issued to the Government Owned Business"
"Undertaking  (GOBU)  of  Acland  Finance  and  Insurance  Limited,  by  the  [Government  owned]"
"National Insurance Corporation should ipso facto be transferred to the Plaintiff, Acland Insurance"
"Services Limited."
"The claim in the instant case is based upon this assumption. The Plaintiff further contends"
"that the [Government owned] National Insurance Corporation was converted to a Public Company,"
"National Insurance Corporation Limited, without any notice or approval or the concurrence of the"
"Plaintiff. Further the Plaintiff avers even after the conversion, no communication, compensation nor"
"settlement was made to the Plaintiff by the Secretary to the Treasury and / or the State."
"The  Plaintiff  therefore  contends,  that  the  Secretary  to  the  Treasury,  has  wrongfully  and"
"unlawfully failed and neglected to transfer the 10,000 shares to the Plaintiff and therefore a cause of"
"action has arisen for the Plaintiff to sue the State."
"I have considered the oral submissions of the learned President’s Counsel for the Plaintiff-"
"Respondent before this Court as well as the written submissions and the oral and written submissions"
"made on behalf of the Secretary to the Treasury."
"Upon consideration of the events that had unfolded and the Legislation passed, it is  quite"
"evident, that in terms of the provisions of Section 3 of the Conversion Act, the assets and liabilities"
"that were transferred to the 2nd Defendant NIC Limited were only what the [Government owned]"
"National Insurance Corporation (NIC) was entitled to hold. As discussed earlier, it was the policy of"
"the Government to convert, NIC to NIC Limited. NIC as clearly seen from the facts narrated earlier"
"in this judgement was established with State funds, and State funds in three State entities of which"
"Acland Insurance Services Ltd, a fully Government owned entity was one. Whilst the Government"
