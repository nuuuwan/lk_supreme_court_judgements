"It appears by this time only the Plaintiff was demanding compensation whereas, the Ceylon"
"Shipping Corporation who raised the initial complaint did not pursue its query."
"Based  upon  the  aforesaid  correspondence  the  Plaintiff  alleges  that  the  Defendants  are"
"estopped from denying the rights of the Plaintiff, which the Plaintiff says were acknowledged and"
"accepted by the predecessor of the 1st Defendant, the Secretary to the Treasury."
"Contrary,  the  position  taken  by  the  Appellants  is  that  there  was  no  acknowledgement  of"
"liability and in any event the claim of the Plaintiff is prescribed."
"Having perused the evidence led and the documents produced, especially the correspondence"
"between the Plaintiff and the State authorities, I am not inclined to accept that there was a specific"
"undertaking or understanding, that the State had a duty to compensate the Plaintiff. A query was"
"made. Though belated, it was looked into. But no final decision was arrived at. In my  view, that"
"cannot be considered as a ‘duty to pay’ as was held by the learned High Court Judge."
"As stated earlier, the initial contribution for establishment of the NIC was made by the entities"
"coming within the purview of the then Ministry of Trade in  July 1981. NIC a  fully Government"
"owned corporation, was converted to a Public Company in February 1993. It was privatized in April"
"1993 as ‘NIC Limited’ and was purchased by P & I Insurance Brokers Private Limited. It is a matter"
"of  interest  that  the  main  Directors  of  the  Plaintiff  Acland  Insurance,  the  2nd  Defendant  National"
"Insurance Corporation Limited, P & I Insurance Brokers Private Limited and Janashakthi Insurance"
"Company Limited (2A Respondent) are one and the same."
"No evidence has been led of the Plaintiff making any claim on the 10,000 shares during the"
"said period and / or at least consequent to the Government owned NIC been converted to a public"
"company. No evidence had also been led of any claim being made by the Plaintiff from April 1993"
"until the Director General of Public Enterprises convened a meeting for May 1996, based on a query"
"raised by a third party."
"Thus, being silent or sleeping over its rights for over seven years [even conceding that the"
"Plaintiff has such a right] I am not inclined to accept the Plaintiff’s proposition ‘that there is no merit"
"in the Appellants’ argument that the Plaintiff’s claim is prescribed.’"
"Moreover,  I  am  not  inclined  to  accept  the  Plaintiff’s  contention  that  in  the  aforesaid,  the"
"Appellants are estopped from denying liability."
"On the evidence led and the submissions made it is quite evident, that there is a delay in the"
"Plaintiff agitating its alleged cause. Whether such delay would amount to prescription at the time"
"the action was filed is a matter that the learned High Court Judge should have gone into, especially"
"in view of the issue bearing number 37 being raised by the 1st Defendant at the trial. In my view,"
"such lapse, taints the judgement and there is substance in the Appellants’ contention that the High"
"Court judgement should be set aside."
"In any event, the Appellant submits that calling parties for a meeting and moving to value"
"shares itself, will not amount to an undertaking or agreement to make a payment."
