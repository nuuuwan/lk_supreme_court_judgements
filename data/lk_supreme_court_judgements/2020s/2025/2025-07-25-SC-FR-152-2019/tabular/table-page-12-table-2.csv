"highlighted  the  futility  of  the  relief  sought  by  a  Petitioner  who  only"
"challenged  his  demotion,  but  was  subsequently  sent  on  vacation  of  the"
"post."
"“The  petitioner  by  this  application  also  moves  for  a  writ  of  mandamus  on  the  first"
"respondent directing that the petitioner be restored to his earlier position i. e. to the post"
"of Project Operator. Even if this application of the petitioner is granted, he is not entitled"
"to resume his earlier office in view of the order of vacation of post (3R9A). Therefore,"
"issuing a writ of mandamus in this case would be futile. In the case of Sethu Ramasamy"
"Vs. Moregodd Gunasekara J. observed that “A mandamus will not be granted when it"
"appears that it would be futile”. In the case of Samsudeen Vs Minister of Defence and"
"External Affairs L. B. de Silva J too remarked that “ A writ of mandamus will not be"
"issued if it will be futile to do so and no purpose will be served”. In the case of Gunasinghe"
