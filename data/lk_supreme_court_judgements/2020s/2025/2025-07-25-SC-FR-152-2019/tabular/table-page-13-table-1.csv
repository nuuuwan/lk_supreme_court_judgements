"Vs. Mayor of Colombo De Kretser J. stated that “A mandamus will not be issued when"
"it  appears  that  it  would  be  futile  in  its  result”.  In  the  case  of  Eksath  Engineru  Saha"
"Samanya Kamkaru Samithiya Vs. S. C. S. de Silva mandamus was sought to compel"
"three  respondents,  the  members  of  an  Industrial  Court,  to  function  as  an  Industrial"
"Court. By the time the application was heard by the Court all three members had ceased"
"to hold office as members of the Court. The writ was refused because parties obviously"
"cannot be ordered to do what they are not qualified to do and are therefore unable to do."
