COUNSEL :

Argued on : 18.02.2021

Decided on : 25.07.2025

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

1. In the instant application the Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of

this court disputing the order of transfer dated 17.03.2019, effected by the

Inspector General of Police subject to the approval of the National Police

Commission on the basis that the said order has been made in violation of

the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

2. The Petitioner contends that the 1st Respondent has engaged in continued

malicious and unreasonable conduct towards the Petitioner, including the

making of baseless allegations to the Inspector General of Police and the

Vishwa Gunaratne for the Petitioner

Dilshan Jayasuriya with Dushinka Nelson and Devaka Jayasuriya instructed by Lahiru Opatha for the 1st Respondent

P a g e 6 | 14

National Police Commission. According to the Petitioner, this conduct has

precipitated repeated transfers, including to supernumerary positions. In

these circumstances, the Petitioner invites this Court to find that the

cumulative acts of the 1st to 12th Respondents have given rise to an

imminent infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Petitioner further seeks a permanent

order staying the operation of the document marked "X4", which orders

the Petitioners transfer from the post of Officer-in-Charge of the

Wadduwa Police Station to ordinary police duties at the Gampaha Police

Station.

3. I take the view that the long litany of complaints contained in the petition

requires a careful examination of several fundamental issues, namely

(a) whether there existed an imminent infringement of the Petitioners

fundamental rights as a result of an executive or administrative action,

thereby entitling the Petitioner to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court.

(b) whether, as alleged by the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent played a role

in effectuating the impugned transfer, reflected in document marked "X4",

dated 17 March 2019?

(c) the futility of the relief sought by the Petitioner; and

(d) the conduct of the Petitioner with respect to the allegation of undue

influence.

P a g e 7 | 14

Was there an imminent infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights

due to an executive or administrative action so as to enable him to seek relief

under Article 126 of the Constitution?

4. The Petitioners case, as presented to this Court, is that the transfers

effected and/or the imminent transfer of the Petitioner amount to an

infringement of his fundamental rights. Leave was granted to the

Petitioner to proceed on the alleged violation of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. The transfer order dated 17.03.2019, directing the Petitioner

to perform normal police duties on exigencies of service, forms the fulcrum

of the Petitioners complaint.

5. The affidavit submitted by the acting Inspector General of Police dated

04.09.2020 categorically sheds light on the sequence of events that

unfolded prior to and after the Petitioners impugned transfer order dated

17.03.2019. At paragraph 16 of the said affidavit the acting Inspector

General of Police averred that by the letter dated 26.02.2019 (marked R2

and appended to the affidavit), the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence

informed the then Inspector General of Police that information had

surfaced to the effect that the Petitioner (the Officer-in-Charge of the

Wadduwa police station at the time) was engaging in alleged acts of

corruption and ill-suited conduct. Through the aforementioned letter, the

Secretary to the Ministry of Defence requested that the Petitioner be

transferred and deployed for normal duties in another police division. A

personal record of the Petitioner was also requested by the same letter.

6. In reply, the then Inspector General of Police by the letter dated 12.03.2019

(marked R3 and appended to the affidavit), forwarded a detailed report

in respect of the prior conduct of the Petitioner with a recommendation

P a g e 8 | 14

that the Petitioner be transferred to the Gampaha Police Station to carry on

with regular police duties.

7. Subsequently, the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence along with the

letter dated 13.03.2019 (marked R4 and appended to the affidavit)

forwarded the letter of the then Inspector General of Police dated

12.03.2019 to the National Police Commission seeking approval for the

transfer of the Petitioner from his position as the Officer-in-Charge of the

Wadduwa Police Station to carry out regular duties at the Gampaha Police

Station.

8. Thereafter, the National Police Commission by a decision arrived at on

14.03.2019 (marked R5 and appended to the affidavit) approved the

transfer of the Petitioner and the appointment of the 10th Respondent as

the Officer-in-Charge of the Wadduwa Police Station.

9. There existed sufficient material before the National Police Commission

effected the transfer and having examined the process that was followed

in arriving at the decision to transfer the Petitioner to the Gampaha Police

Station, this court sees no breach of protocol or mala fides on the part of the

National Police Commission in approving the transfer of the Petitioner.

Furthermore, this court emphatically notes that the Petitioner has in both

the Petition and the written submissions, conceded that the National

Police Commission is an independent institution established for the

protection of the rule of law. No allegation of malice or mala fides is made

against the National Police Commission except for the fact that it did not

afford him an opportunity to be heard. Given that the transfer was made

on exigencies of service and the Petitioner was in a transferable service,

P a g e 9 | 14

the question of transfer was a condition of service consensually agreed

upon by the Petitioner and enforcement of this consensual condition

without inquiry or opportunity to show cause does not violate the

principles of natural justice-for comparable jurisprudence across the Palk

Strait on consensual conditions of service or alteration thereof -see

Himachal Pradesh Road Transport Corporation v Hukam Chand.1

10. Be that as it may, I take the view that there is no evidence of malicious

intent or unfair treatment on the part of the National Police Commission

or the then Inspector General of Police, such as would amount to an

infringement or imminent infringement by executive or administrative action of any

fundamental right within the meaning of Article 126 of the Constitution.

Accordingly, no relief would lie against the Inspector General of Police or

the National Police Commission.

11. It then remains to be considered whether any relief is warranted as against

the 1st Respondent-the Deputy Inspector General of Police.

The alleged involvement of the 1st Respondent in the impugned transfer

dated 17.03.2019.

12. In his prayer, the Petitioner seeks an order declaring that the collective acts

of the 1st to 12th Respondents have caused an imminent infringement of his

fundamental rights. Having found that the procedure adopted in effecting

the impugned transfer was not tainted by malicious intent, I now turn to

examine the reasons why the Petitioners assertion that the 1st

1 (2009) II SCC 222, 224-225 (para 13).

P a g e 10 | 14

Respondent colluded with the Inspector General of Police and the

National Police Commission to effect his transfer is misconceived.

13. A preliminary objection was put forth by the learned Counsel for the 1st

Respondent that as per the powers granted to the National Police

Commission by virtue of the Constitution, read together with the Gazette

Notification bearing No. 2016/6 dated 24.04.2017, the 1st Respondent has

not been vested with the power or authority to make decisions regarding

the transfer of Officers-in-Charge of Police stations and that therefore the

1st Respondent played no role in causing the transfer of the Petitioner and

furthermore that the 1st Respondent has erroneously been cited as party to

the present application.

Article 155J of the Constitution reads as follows:

(1) The Commission may, subject to such conditions and procedures as may be prescribed

by the Commission, delegate to the Inspector-General of Police or in consultation with the

Inspector-General of Police to any Police Officer, its powers of appointment, promotion,

transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of any category of police officers.

(2) The Commission shall cause any such delegation to be published in the Gazette.

14. Pursuant to the aforementioned article, by the Gazette Notification

bearing No. 2016/6 dated 24.04.2017, the National Police Commission has

delegated certain powers to the Inspector General of Police and Senior

Deputy Inspector Generals of Police including the power to transfer Chief

Inspectors provided they are not Officers-in-Charge of Police Stations.

15. It is especially significant to the present matter that the National Police

Commission has retained the power to effectuate transfers of Officers-in-

Charge of Police Stations as the Petitioner was, at the time the impugned

transfer was ordered, the Officer-in-Charge of the Wadduwa Police Station.

P a g e 11 | 14

It is therefore clear that the 1st Respondent could not have legally

authorized or ordered the transfer of the Petitioner.

16. In fact, all parties to the present application, including the Petitioner have

admitted and conceded the fact that by virtue of the Gazette Notification

bearing No. 2016/6 dated 24.04.2017, the 1st Respondent did not have the

power or legal authority to order the transfer of the Petitioner.

17. In any case, the Petitioner has failed to prove any logical nexus between

the 1st Respondent and the procedure involving the National Police

Commission and the Inspector General of Police who made the decision

regarding the impugned transfer order. There is no evidence before this

court to arrive at the conclusion that the 1st Respondent asserted undue

influence in order to have the Petitioner transferred.

18. The correspondence between the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, the

then Inspector General of Police and the National Police Commission

presented to this court along with the affidavit of the acting Inspector

General of Police sufficiently evinces this fact. In these circumstances, this

court refuses to hold the 1st 12th Respondents as having collectively

infringed the fundamental rights of the Petitioner.

The nugatory nature of the relief prayed for by the Petitioner the futility

question

19. Even assuming the circumstances were to favour the Petitioner and this

Court were to conclude that his fundamental rights had in fact been

infringed, the relief sought by the Petitioner would nonetheless be

nugatory. This is because the Petitioner has since been transferred on two

P a g e 12 | 14

further occasions: first, to the Western Province (South) Traffic Division

on 13.07.2019, and thereafter to the Special Investigation Unit of the

Mirihana Police Station on 18.07.2019. The Petitioner has not challenged

these subsequent transfers. Accordingly, any order staying the impugned

transfer to the Gampaha Police Station which preceded these later

transfers would have no material effect on the Petitioners present

position. It would serve no purpose and would be futile to grant a

permanent stay of the impugned transfer, as that transfer has since been

superseded and replaced by subsequent transfers, rendering any

prospective relief both otiose and nugatory. In any event, for the reasons

set out above, the Court finds that the challenged transfer does not

infringe Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

20.In Selvamani v. Dr. Kumaravelupillai and Others,2 Sisira de Abrew, J.

highlighted the futility of the relief sought by a Petitioner who only

challenged his demotion, but was subsequently sent on vacation of the

post.

The petitioner by this application also moves for a writ of mandamus on the first

respondent directing that the petitioner be restored to his earlier position i. e. to the post

of Project Operator. Even if this application of the petitioner is granted, he is not entitled

to resume his earlier office in view of the order of vacation of post (3R9A). Therefore,

issuing a writ of mandamus in this case would be futile. In the case of Sethu Ramasamy

Vs. Moregodd Gunasekara J. observed that A mandamus will not be granted when it

appears that it would be futile. In the case of Samsudeen Vs Minister of Defence and

External Affairs L. B. de Silva J too remarked that A writ of mandamus will not be

issued if it will be futile to do so and no purpose will be served. In the case of Gunasinghe

2 (2005) 2 Sri.LR 99.

P a g e 13 | 14

Vs. Mayor of Colombo De Kretser J. stated that A mandamus will not be issued when

it appears that it would be futile in its result. In the case of Eksath Engineru Saha

Samanya Kamkaru Samithiya Vs. S. C. S. de Silva mandamus was sought to compel

three respondents, the members of an Industrial Court, to function as an Industrial

Court. By the time the application was heard by the Court all three members had ceased

to hold office as members of the Court. The writ was refused because parties obviously

cannot be ordered to do what they are not qualified to do and are therefore unable to do.

Applying the legal principles stated in the aforesaid decisions, I hold that the mandamus

will not be granted when it appears that it would be futile.

21. I therefore hold that the relief sought by the Petitioner, if granted, in any

case would be of no value in law and therefore would not serve any

material purpose in changing the status quo of the Petitioner.

22. At this juncture it is pertinent to mention that the Petitioner has since

been interdicted after his transfers since 17.03.2019 but I will not venture

into details of the interdiction and subsequent developments since it is

immaterial to the order sought to be challenged in this case.

The conduct of the Petitioner on the issue of undue influence.

At paragraph 29A of the Petition, the Petitioner admits that when he received a

transfer order to a supernumerary position in Mount Lavinia at the time he was

serving as the Officer-in-Charge of the Kaluthara North Police Station, twenty two

head priests and other dignitaries intervened in stopping the said transfer.

However, a perusal of the said transfer order marked X12 indicates that it was

ordered on exigencies of service with the approval of the National Police

Commission. Thus, it warrants a conclusion that this transfer order was part of

a routine transfer procedure purely based on a service requirement. In the

Affidavit provided by the acting Inspector General of Police it is asserted that

P a g e 14 | 14

contrary to the averments of the Petitioner that the said transfer was ill-

motivated, the Petitioner had in fact sought to canvass the support of priests and

other dignitaries to reverse a lawful transfer order issued to him. He had not

reported to service at Mount Lavinia and had proceeded to exert undue influence

to get a transfer from Kalutara North to Wadduwa.

This court takes the view that by his prior conduct the Petitioner has himself

undermined the very rationale of the National Police Commission which he

sought to rely on by stating that it was introduced for the purposes of

depoliticizing institutions, strengthening the rule of law and promoting good

governance in the country and that the undue influence of the 1st Respondent

influenced the impugned transfer order dated 17.03.2019. It seems rather ironic

that the Petitioner has come to court seeking justice with unclean hands.

In these circumstances, I take the view that the application of the Petitioner is

unmeritorious and it is therefore dismissed.
