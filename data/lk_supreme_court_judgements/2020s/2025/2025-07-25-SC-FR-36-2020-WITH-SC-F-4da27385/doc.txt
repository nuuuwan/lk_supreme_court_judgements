Introduction

1. This Court is called upon to determine whether the actions of the Respondents

in classifying the Petitionersofficers previously recruited to the Reserve

Assistant Superintendent of Police cadreinto a "Support Service" within the

regular police structure amounts to a violation of their fundamental rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

2. This application SC FR 36/2020 consolidates the grievances arising from a

series of prior proceedings, namely SC FR 374/07, SC FR 348/12, SC FR 71/16,

and SC Contempt 05/20. The parties have consented to the determination in

this case as dispositive of the other related matters.

Factual and Procedural History

3. The Petitioners were recruited as Reserve Assistant Superintendents of Police

on 21st March 2006, at a time when the Police Reserve Service had been

abolished. By a Cabinet decision, it was agreed that these officers would be

absorbed into the Regular Police Service.

P a g e 24 | 29

4. Due to administrative inertia, this integration was not effectuated, leading to

SC FR 374/07, in which the State undertookon 10th June 2008to absorb

the Petitioners into the Regular Service with effect from the original date of

appointment. That application was settled based on the undertaking.

5. However, subsequent to that undertaking, the then Inspector General of Police

issued Circular No. 2070/2008 dated 27th June 2008, purporting to re-classify

the Petitioners into Special and Technical Cadres. This act, which followed just

17 days after the States commitment before this Court, sparked further

litigation in SC FR 348/12.

6. While the matter remained thus unresolved, a seniority list dated 29th

January 2016 placed the Petitioners in a segregated list separate from officers

who were recruited subsequently. This arbitrary categorization formed the

basis of SC FR 71/16.

7. Despite clear instructions from the National Police Commission (letters dated

15.10.2008 and 30.10.2009) that the Petitioners were part of the Regular

Cadre, the Respondents issued new letters of appointment on or before 9th

January 2020 reassigning the Petitioners into a so-called "Support Service".

This final act triggered the present application.

Petitioners Contentions

8. The Petitioners contend:

P a g e 25 | 29

That they have been continuously discriminated against despite the

Supreme Court-sanctioned settlement in SC FR 374/07.

That their classification into "Support Services" is arbitrary and lacks

consultation or justification.

That they have a legitimate expectation to be treated as part of the Regular

Police Cadre.

That similarly circumstanced officers were treated more favourably in terms

of career progression.

That their non-promotion and exclusion from the main seniority list

constitute a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Respondents Preliminary Objections

9. The Respondents assert:

That a reasonable classification exists based on the Petitioners educational

qualifications and specialized training.

That grievances have been resolved through approved Schemes of

Recruitment.

That the claims are time-barred due to delays in challenging Circular

2070/2008

P a g e 26 | 29

10. I must state that it is not the delay in challenging the IGPs circular that

surfaces to the fore but the continuing episodes of classification that pervades

the case.

Reasonable Classification

11. The law permits classification, but it is trite that classification must not be

arbitrary and must have a rational nexus to the objective sought. The Petitioners

were absorbed into the Regular Cadre by a Cabinet decision and by the

unequivocal undertaking given to this Court. The classification imposed by

Circular 2070/2008 lacks legal sanction from the National Police Commission or

the Public Services Commission and undermines the legitimate expectation

created by the States undertaking.

12. Having regard to the pleadings and documents filed on behalf of all parties,

this Court takes the view that the post-hoc creation of a "Support Service" and

issuance of appointment letters without consultation or objective criteria offends

Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Legitimate Expectation

13. The Petitioners' expectation of equal treatment with similarly situated officers

is founded on law and fact. Letters from the National Police Commission support

their contention that they were absorbed into the Regular Cadre effective 21st

March 2006. The failure to treat them on par with other regular officers and the

P a g e 27 | 29

sudden creation of a new cadre violates the doctrine of legitimate expectation. The

Petitioners have undergone training in the same way as the other officer any

classification s in the regular service

Arbitrariness and Discrimination

14. The Court would allude to Rienzie Perera v UGC, Charanjit Lal

Chowdhury v Union of India1 and Dayarathna v Minister of Health2 to

affirm that arbitrariness, lack of consultation, and discriminatory treatment of

individuals in similar positions contravenes the principles of equality and non-

discrimination enshrined in Article 12(1). In fact, Chowdhury v Union of India3

it was clearly stated:

a law applying to one person or one class of persons or one class of persons is

constitutional if there is sufficient basis for the reason or reason for it. Any

classification which is arbitrary and which is made without any basis is no

classification and a proper classification must always rest upon some

difference and must bear a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect

of which it is proposed.

15. The classification into a Support Service was not merely administrative

reorganization but had significant career implications. The Petitioners missed

1 (1978) 1 Sri L.R.128. 2 (1999) 1 Sri L.R. 393. 3 (1950) AIR 41, 1950 SCR 869

P a g e 28 | 29

promotional opportunities that, per the Regular Cadre Scheme, should have

placed them at the rank of DIG by March 2023.

Delay and Time Bar

16. The Court finds the argument on time bar to be without merit. The continuous

nature of the violation and the absence of finality in earlier proceedings keeps the

cause of action alive. Further, the issuance of the 2020 appointment letters

amounts to a fresh executive act warranting scrutiny.

Contempt Allegation (SC Contempt 05/20)

17. While this Court does not reach a finding on contempt in this judgment, it

must be noted that non-compliance with the undertaking given in SC FR 374/07

reinforces the Petitioners' claim of a continuing violation of their fundamental

rights.For the foregoing reasons, this Court holds that:

The decision to categorize the Petitioners into a separate Support Service

without consultation, and contrary to a prior undertaking and Cabinet

decision, amounts to an infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights

under Article 12(1).

The Petitioners are entitled to be treated as part of the Regular Police Cadre

with effect from 21st March 2006.

The appointment letters dated on or before 9th January 2020 are quashed

to the extent they assign the Petitioners to a separate Support Service.

members of the Regular Police Cadre effective from 21st March 2006.

2. The Respondents are directed to reintegrate the Petitioners into the Regular

Police Cadre and restore their seniority and career progression as per the

applicable scheme of recruitment.

3. The impugned appointment letters categorizing them into the Support

Service are hereby quashed.
