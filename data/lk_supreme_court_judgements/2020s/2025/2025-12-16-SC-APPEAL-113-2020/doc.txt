SC/APPEAL/113/2020

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Gampaha seeking a

declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the plaint (Lot

32 of Plan No. 935 prepared by the Surveyor General), ejectment of the

defendant from the strip of land along the eastern boundary of the said Lot,

and damages. The defendant is in possession of the land lying on the

eastern side of Lot 32. The portion allegedly encroached by the defendant

along the eastern boundary was depicted as Lot B, in extent of 0.60 perches,

in Plan marked X at the trial.

The plaintiff became entitled to Lot 32 by virtue of a Grant issued in 1982

under section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance. She complained

to the Divisional Secretary of Gampaha regarding the encroachment, but

the Divisional Secretary was unable to settle the dispute and directed the

parties to seek a resolution through Court.

The defendant claimed prescriptive title to Lot B in Plan X. After trial, the

District Court entered judgment in favour of the plaintiff. On appeal, the

High Court of Civil Appeal of Gampaha set aside the judgment of the District

Court and dismissed the plaintiff’s action, holding inter alia that the

defendant had acquired title to Lot B in Plan X by prescription. Hence this

appeal by the plaintiff.

There is no dispute that, on the plaintiff’s evidence alone, the defendant’s

prescriptive claim would ordinarily succeed. The defendant became the

owner of the adjoining land by Deed marked V2 in 1991. It is the clear

evidence of the plaintiff that, approximately three months after the

defendant purchased that land, the defendant erected a barbed-wire fence

separating the plaintiff’s land from the defendant’s land and continued to

possess the disputed portion in that manner until this action was filed in

the District Court in 2008.

SC/APPEAL/113/2020

The argument of learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellant is that section

161 of the Land Development Ordinance precludes the defendant from

acquiring prescriptive title to the plaintiff’s land. This is the principal

question of law on which leave to appeal was granted by this Court.

Section 161 of the Land Development Ordinance provides as follows:

No person shall, by possession of any land alienated on a permit,

acquire any prescriptive title thereto against any other person or

against the State.

It is significant that the Land Development Ordinance expressly recognises,

and indeed distinguishes between, a Permit and a Grant. In terms of section

19 of the Ordinance, it is the Permit that matures into a Grant upon the

fulfilment of the stipulated conditions. Nevertheless, the Ordinance does

not use the two terms interchangeably. On the contrary, section 2, which

contains the interpretation provisions, defines “Permit” and “Grant” as two

distinct legal concepts, each carrying different rights and obligations. In

instances where the same statutory provision is intended to apply to land

alienated on a Permit as well as land alienated on a Grant, the Act

specifically states so. For instance, sections 39, 40 and 41 of the Land

Development Ordinance refer to “land alienated on a permit or grant”.

Section 161 is confined in its application to land “alienated on a permit”.

The Legislature has not extended that protection to land alienated on a

Grant.

The above position is fortified when considering the legislative history of

section 161 of the Land Development Ordinance. Section 161 originally

provided that “No person shall, by possession of any land alienated on a

permit or a grant, acquire any prescriptive title thereto against any other

person or against the Crown.” This section was amended by the Land

Development (Amendment) Act No. 16 of 1969 by removing the word “grant”

from its ambit, so that it now reads: “No person shall, by possession of any

4

SC/APPEAL/113/2020

land alienated on a permit, acquire any prescriptive title thereto against any

other person or against the State.” Where the Legislature has chosen to refer

specifically to land held on a Permit, and has omitted any reference to land

held on a Grant, the Court must give effect to that choice. In the present

case, the plaintiff became entitled to her land under a Grant. Accordingly,

section 161 of the Land Development Ordinance has no application to this

case.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff-appellant also referred to several provisions

of the Land Development Ordinance in support of the submission that,

notwithstanding the issuance of a Grant, the State continues to retain

control over such land and therefore the defendant-respondent cannot

acquire any portion of it by prescriptive possession. Whatever the extent of

such control may be, it is immaterial to the present dispute. The State is

not a party to this action, and the issue before this Court concerns only the

competing rights of the plaintiff and the defendant. Any residual powers

that the State may possess under the Ordinance are therefore irrelevant to

the determination of this case, and in any event the State will not be bound

by this judgment. As noted earlier, it was the Divisional Secretary himself

who advised the parties to resolve their dispute through Court.

The question of law on which leave was granted is answered against the

plaintiff-appellant. The appeal is dismissed. No costs.
