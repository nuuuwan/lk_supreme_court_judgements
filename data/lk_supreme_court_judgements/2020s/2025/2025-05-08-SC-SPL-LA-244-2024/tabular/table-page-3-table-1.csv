"We  bear  in  mind  that  as  rightly  contended  for  by  the  counsel  for  the  Petitioner,  any"
"accused  or  suspect  could  be  deprived  of  their  personal  liberty  only  by  a  procedure"
"established by law."
"We also make the observation that illegal detention, if any, could have been addressed"
"by the invocation of the fundamental rights jurisdiction that this court is vested with in"
"terms of Article 126 of the Constitution."
"We have taken all these factors into consideration and observe that Magistrates should"
"bear  in mind  the  provisions of the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  No.  15  of 1979  as"
"amended and all other relevant statutes before making orders that impinge upon rights"
"of parties including those of an accused person."
"If orders are made to deprive a person of his liberty such orders have to be sanctioned by"
"law and any infractions of the governing law in regard to incarceration of suspects have"
"to be dealt with in accordance with the law and in the proper forum."
"The  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  also  made  the  submission  that  though  section"
"115(2)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  No,  15  of  1979  did  not  authorize  the"
"continued detention of the Petitioner, the prosecution cannot take refuge under section"
"83(2) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No.41"
"of 2022 in order to continue the detention until the indictment is preferred. In response,"
"the  learned  State  Counsel  made  the  submission  that  the  aforesaid  provision  namely"
"section 83(2) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act"
"No.41 of 2022 impliedly authorized the detention."
"We have considered all these arguments and decide that it is too late in the day to assay"
"this argument in an appeal, now that a trial upon an indictment may pave the way for"
"the Accused â€“ Petitioner to secure his freedom."
"So, leave is refused but we direct the learned High Court Judge of Colombo to begin the"
"trial in HC 5047/24 against this accused as expeditiously as possible and have a day to"
"day trial so as to ensure that the trial comes to a completion."
"We  make  the  above  order  of  expedition  having  due  regard  to  the  submissions  placed"
"before this Court by both the learned counsel for the Petitioner as well as the learned"
"State Counsel."
