"separate  entity.  Such  an  assumption  is  only  “for  the  purposes  of  this  Law”…  The"
"moment this Law comes into operation the undivided share of a co-owner, whether"
"he be one whose interest are over fifty acres or not, becomes, in the eye of the law, a"
"distinct and separate entity, equal to the undivided extent he was earlier entitled to"
"in the common land. Such entity is, at that time, still not identified or located on the"
"ground, as distinct from the larger land… By the use of this fiction undivided interest"
"are treated as divided, and a co-owner is treated as the sole owner of a distinct entity,"
"in order to ser the provisions of this Law in motion. The effect of the operation of the"
"provisions of sec. 7 is to bring about a separation or partition of the undivided share"
"of a person, who, at the time this Law comes into operation, owns such interests in"
"common with several others, and transform such undivided share into a distinct and"
"separate portion… The combined operation of the provisions of sec. 2 and sec. 7 of"
"this  Law  would  result,  in  the  case of  a  person,  coming  within  sec.  3(2),  but  whose"
"interest in agricultural land comprise, either wholly or party, undivided share or share"
"of land, in such undivided shares being converted, albeit notionally, to a distinct and"
"separate entity, and such distinct and separate entity then being treated as vesting"
"in the Commission. The undivided share of a person would thus, in law, be considered"
"as having ceased to exist as an undivided share, and being separated off from the"
"undivided shares of the other co-owners, and bcoming [sic] a distinct and separate"
"entity… The distinct and separate entity brought into being, though at that stage only"
"notionally and confined to paper without any  identification of its existence on the"
"ground, will become identified and located on the ground once the provisions of sec."
"18, 19 and 21 have run their operational course.”"
