"may be allowed to retain. Although Section 3(1) provides that all such land beyond the"
"ceiling shall be deemed to vest in the Commission, the exact metes and bounds of the"
"lands to be vested remain uncertain until such determination."
"27.  Where the Commission makes a ‘statutory determination’ under and in terms of Section"
"19 as to what portions of land a person may retain with them, such person in whose favour"
"such  determination 
is  made  becomes  an  owner  of  such 
land  with  all 
incidents  of"
"ownership. The land does not cease to be a distinct and separate entity and does not once"
"again become an undivided portion of a larger land following such determination, even"
"where such land was co-owned at the time of vesting the same in the Commission.6"
"28.  The Appellant sought to distinguish Jinawathie and Others v. Emalin Perera (supra)"
"from the case at hand, arguing that the dicta of the Jinawathie Case to be only applicable"
"where  the  Land  Reforms  Commission  has  made  a  statutory  determination.  While  the"
"Appellant is correct in this assertion that the Jinawathie Case is not binding with respect"
"to inter-family transfers effected in terms of Section 14 of the Law, it is illuminative as to"
"how the scheme of the Law operates as against co-owned lands."
"29.  The Jinawathie Case also makes it amply clear that, where one of several co-owners hold"
"land over the ceiling imposed by the Law and any undivided share of such co-owner is"
"deemed to vest in the Commission, such share is considered, in law, as being separated"
"from the undivided  shares of other co-owners, having ceased to  exist as an undivided"
"share. The share of such co-owner whose rights overshot the ceiling is then considered a"
"distinct and separate entity for the purpose of the Land Reform Law."
"30.  The  Appellant  contended,  however, 
that  co-ownership  with 
respect 
to  Mattegoda"
"Muakalana  has not been terminated. The Appellant further contended that, in spite of"
