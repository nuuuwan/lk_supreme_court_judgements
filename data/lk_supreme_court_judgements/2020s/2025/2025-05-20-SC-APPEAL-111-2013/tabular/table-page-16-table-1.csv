"35.  Obeyesekere, J has elaborated on this position further in the said judgment as follows:"
"“The learned President’s Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that with the coming into"
"operation of the Law and with land over and above the ceiling deemed to have been"
"vested in the Commission free of any encumbrance, the Plaintiff’s father lost his title"
"to the mortgaged property and was transformed into a statutory lessee. He therefore"
"submitted that when the Plaintiff’s father executed Deed No. 2085, he did so not as"
"the owner of Manomani Estate which was subject to a mortgage but as the statutory"
"lessee  of  a  land  that  was  no  longer  encumbered.  He  submitted  further  that  with"
"Manomani  Estate  being  deemed  vested  in  the  Commission  in  1972,  the  Plaintiff"
"derived her title to 25 acres of Manomani Estate not from her father but from the"
"Commission, and most importantly, free of any encumbrance."
"I am unable to agree with this argument of the learned President’s Counsel for the"
"Plaintiff.  Although  in  terms  of  Section  3(2),  all  agricultural  lands  in  excess  of  the"
"ceiling are deemed to have vested in the Commission on the day the Law came into"
"operation by way of a legal fiction, as I have already stated, for the purposes of this"
"case, that vesting is subject to:"
"(a) a statutory determination of the land area amounting to 50 acres that an owner"
