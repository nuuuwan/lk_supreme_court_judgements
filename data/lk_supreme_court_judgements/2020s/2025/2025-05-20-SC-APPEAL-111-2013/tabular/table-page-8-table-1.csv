"","17th June 1955, while the former was not registered until 24th June 1995."
"10.  Both the learned District Judge as well as the  learned High Court Judge have correctly",""
"","come to the conclusion that the latter Deed, i.e., Deed No. 4551 of 12th June 1955 (marked"
"","‘V3’), is entitled to the benefit of prior registration in terms of Section 7 of the Registration"
"","of Documents Ordinance. However, this in itself does not defeat the Plaintiffs’ title. Deed"
"","No. 8289 was jointly executed by Celestina Jayawardane and her husband, Don Manis. As"
"","the Appellant conceded in the written submissions, Don Manis conveyed to Don Davith,"
"","undivided two acres from the five acres he owned, by Deed marked ‘P2’. Subsequent to"
"","this conveyance, he had left with him undivided rights over three acres of the said land."
"","As such, the title of Celestina Jayawardane, by virtue of Deed No. 1043 of 18th July 1941"
"","(marked ‘P3’) per se does not prove or disprove the Plaintiffs’ title, as title could devolve"
"","to Charles Silva from that of Don Manis."

"12.","It is these rights claimed by Charles Silva that had then been conveyed to the Plaintiffs’"
"","father, Seeman Perera, by Deed No. 1769 of 04th August 1951 (marked ‘P14’). It is very"

"","one  acre  and  two  roods  as  divided  by  Plan  No.  4190  to  said  Seeman  Perera.  Seeman"
"","Perera had thereafter leased the property to various parties on several instances."
