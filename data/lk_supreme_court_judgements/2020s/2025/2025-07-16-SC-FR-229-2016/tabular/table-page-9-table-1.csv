"petitioner states that the evidence placed, contradicts the time period put forth"
"by the respondents as to when the injury took place, as the respondents allege"
"the injury occurred while he was on leave from the 1st of April, 2007. But"
"whether the injury occurred on the 27th of February, 2007 is still in question,"
"however, it does align with the time period of the injury occurring, according to"
"the petitioner. It also backs the claim of the petitioner that the injury took"
"place while the officer was on duty."
"Despite the radiographerâ€™s note validating what the petitioner claims, I am not"
"inclined, in the circumstances of the case, to take the facts at face value, as it"
"is a vaguely worded note stating that the x-ray was taken on 09.03.2007."
"Therefore, even if the time bar objection is overruled, the lack of medical"
"evidence to substantiate the grounds urged by the petitioner makes this court"
"to conclude that the fundamental rights of the petitioner under Article 12(1)"
"has not been violated."
"As such, this Court is compelled to dismiss the instant application, with no"
"costs."
