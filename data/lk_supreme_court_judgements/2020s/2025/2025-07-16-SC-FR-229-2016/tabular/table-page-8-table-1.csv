"should be presented to the Supreme Court within one month of such violation,"
"According to S.C F.R 206/2008, decided on 9th of December, 2016 by Justice"
"Prasanna Jayawardena PC, J. it has been held that,"
"“In this regard, as stated earlier, the general rule is clearly that, this Court"
"will regard compliance with the “one-month limit‟ stipulated by Article 126"
"(2) of the Constitution as being mandatory and refuse to entertain or"
"further proceed with an application under Article 126 (1) of the"
"Constitution, which has been filed after the expiry of one month from the"
"occurrence of the alleged infringement or imminent infringement. However,"
"this Court has consistently recognized the fact that, the duty entrusted to"
"this Court by the Constitution to give relief to and protect a person whose"
"Fundamental Rights have been infringed by executive or administrative"
"action, requires Article 126 (2) of the Constitution to be interpreted and"
"applied in a manner which takes into account the reality of the facts and"
"circumstances which found the application. This Court has recognized that"
"it would fail to fulfill its guardianship if the time limit of one month is"
"applied by rote and the Court remains blind to facts and circumstances"
"which have denied a Petitioner of an opportunity to invoke the jurisdiction"
"of Court earlier.”"
