"Thereafter, the petitioner had reported back to work only on the 25th of"
"September 2007, to the Maha Oya STF camp. The petitioner claims that he,"
"during this time, had taken medical treatment from Huruluwewa Government"
"hospital where he had taken an x-ray, according to which he was"
"recommended surgery."
"Although the petitioner had taken leave and gone home, the respondents have"
"stated that he had failed to obtain medical leave, as a result of which, he had"
"been referred before a medical board to approve medical leave and to assess"
"the petitionerâ€™s physical fitness to continue in service. The medical board had"
"declared on the 27th of June, 2007, that he was unfit for service and that he be"
"retired. Therefore, he had been retired with effect from 22nd of June, 2010, on"
"general medical grounds. It is submitted by the respondents that he could not"
"be granted with any other relief because the injuries sustained by him had not"
"been on record officially."
"Thereafter, the petitioner had made several appeals and the Special Task Force"
"had appointed a special committee on the 26th of September, 2011, which"
"concluded that the petitioner had not sustained the injury on the 27th of"
"February, 2009, but in April, 2007, while he had been on leave at home."
"Therefore, the committee had unanimously agreed with the decision formerly"
"made by the medical board."
"The petitioner had cited Police Administration Circular bearing no. 21/88,"
"which had been issued in respect of officers, who had sustained injuries, as a"
"result of terrorist attacks."
"The petitioner further alleges that, due to the conclusion of the Medical board,"
"he is unable to obtain any relief under the above circular. But the respondents"
"have stated that the petitioner had not forwarded any medical reports to"
"substantiate the fact that he sustained the impugned injury during the"
"terrorist attack on 27th February 2007. Therefore, the Medical board and the"
"committee appointed, rightfully concluded that his retirement should not be on"
"medical grounds, which deprives him of obtaining any relief under the above-"
"mentioned circular."
"The respondents have alleged that the decision of the medical board dated 11th"
"October 2010, had not been challenged by the petitioner in terms of Article 126"
"of the constitution, which states the timeline as one month from the alleged"
"incident. Therefore, the respondents further stated that the petition is estopped"
"from seeking relief under the provisions of the constitution."
