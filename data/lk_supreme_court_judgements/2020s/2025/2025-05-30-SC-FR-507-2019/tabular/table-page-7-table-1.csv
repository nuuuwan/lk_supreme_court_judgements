"The petitioners further state that the salary structure of the petitioner’s service"
"includes, the basic salary, salary adjustments, cost of living allowance and"
"other allowances, which includes professional allowance."
"The petitioners allege that this professional allowance has been revised and"
"that the petitioners were not included in that scheme but qualifications"
"required to be included in that scheme are to be, head of a division and"
"possess an MBA or any other post graduate qualification in any Financing"
"subject or a post graduate qualification in Business Management."
"Similarly, Engineers also have been included in this category, if they hold the"
"position of an Engineer or have registered with the Engineering charter."
"The petitioners further allege that they pursued their post graduate education"
"in Business Management with the legitimate expectation of being eligible for"
"the professional allowance before it was revised."
"Therefore, the petitioners have alleged that the revision in 2017, by way of P18,"
"has violated their fundamental rights under Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"Upon the support of this application, this Court has granted leave under article"
"12 (1) of the Constitution."
"The respondents in their written submissions have stated that the petitioners"
"are in the field of Engineering and therefore do not fall under a general"
"category, which makes their studies in Business administration and other"
"Commercial aspect studies being redundant and not being relevant."
"The respondents have further averred that the petitioners have been paid for"
"their training in professional studies since 2011 but this does not qualify them"
"to receive the professional allowance because they fall short of the “Engineering"
"category”."
"The respondents have further averred that the petitioners were paid the"
"professional allowance for a short period until the ambiguities in the payment"
"scheme for the Engineering category were ironed out."
"The respondents have averred that the petitioners were adequately warned of"
"the futility in them pursuing the MBA courses by way of P8 and P15 and they"
"also state that most of the petitioners have enrolled in their studies after the"
"warning has been issued."
"Furthermore, the petitioners also have taken up the objection of the time bar"
"which they substantiate by saying that the revision was made and informed on"
