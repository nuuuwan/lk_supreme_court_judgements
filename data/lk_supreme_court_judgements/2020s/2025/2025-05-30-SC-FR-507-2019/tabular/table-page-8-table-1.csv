"the 11th of September, 2017 but the petitioners have prayed for relief on the"
"22nd of June 2018, which is well over one month."
"Therefore, upon considering the facts stated by the petitioners and the"
"respondents, it is very clear to this Court that the petitioners were involved in"
"an employment in the Engineering field but minus the professional"
"qualification which has deprived them of the professional allowance from 2017."
"Until 2017 the professional allowance had been paid to the general category"
"due to the rules governing the payment not being clearly set out."
"But by September, 2017, it has been set right and P18 has been issued which"
"had clearly indicated who can be paid the professional allowance."
"The petitioners had arduously argued that their legitimate expectations were"
"unfulfilled by the actions of the respondents and that their rights had been"
"violated under article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"Article 12(1) of the constitution stipulates an equal protection under the law,"
"and in page 81 of the book titled “Fundamental rights in Sri Lanka” by"
"Justice S. Sharvananda, where he states that “Equality before the law means"
"that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered"
"and that the like should be treated alike”. He further asserts, “the rule is that the"
"like should be treated alike and not, that unlike should treated alike”."
"At this point I also draw my attention to the case of Pathumma and others vs"
"The State of Kerala A.I.R 1978 S.C. 771 at 786 where it was held that,"
