"But as pointed out by the respondents, they had come to Court well over one"
"month. This delay, which is substantial, makes this application time barred."
"Therefore, on considering the material stated above by the petitioners, it is"
"clear with certainty that the petitionersâ€™ employment did not fall within the"
"category specified in P18. The petitioners had been duly informed, by way of P8"
"and P15, that the studies they were pursuing was not relevant for the"
"classification they were trying to obtain when the state policy has been revised"
"by P18."
"Upon considering the material submitted by the petitioners, it appears to this"
"Court that they were trying to pursue a rainbow in the sky, which was"
"definitely out of their reach, when they had been well warned and educated."
"Therefore, I am of the opinion that the material submitted by the petitioners do"
"not establish any infringement of a right under Article 12(1) of the"
"Constitution, with the requisite degree of certainty."
"As such, the instant application is dismissed without costs."
