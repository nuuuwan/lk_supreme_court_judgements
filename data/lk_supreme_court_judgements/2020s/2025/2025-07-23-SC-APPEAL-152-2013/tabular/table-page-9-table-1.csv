"Consequently, 
the  burden 
to  prove  elements  such  as 
intentional  misconduct,  gross"
"negligence,  or  breaches  of  specific  service  rules  rests  with  the  employer,  even  if  the"
"employee  admits  to  the  mere  loss  or  shortage  of  goods.  Anyhow,  the  defence  of  the"
"employee for such loss or shortfall should be materially considered by the Labour Tribunal"
"in  assessing  whether 
the 
termination  of 
services 
is 
justifiable  or  when  ordering"
"reinstatement.  Considering  the  nature  of  the  Respondent’s  admission  and  the  reasons"
"outlined  above,  I  believe  the  key 
issue 
is 
identifying  who  should  provide  evidence"
"regarding  the  surrounding  circumstances  to  establish  whether  the  Respondent’s  actions"
"were entirely voluntary, constituted wrongdoing, or amounted to gross negligence. Hence,"
"I take the view that the arguments of shifting the burden on how the loss of flour occurred"
"do not materially affect the conclusions that I will reach in this judgment."
"Whether the Termination of Services is Justifiable"
"The learned President of the LT noted in his Order that the only evidence presented by the"
"Appellants to prove that the flour shortage resulted from an act of cheating was a statement"
"by  Senior  Assistant  Superintendent  (Migara  Bandara  Meegahakumbura),  who  reported"
"receiving complaints from a set of workers that no flour was issued to them despite salary"
"deductions. Even such evidence was rejected by the  said President, deeming it hearsay."
"The Appellants failed to substantiate the aforesaid complaints with independent witness"
"testimony or written documentation. The LT disregarded the evidence of the said Senior"
"Assistant Superintendent, stating it did not establish any deceitful act by the Respondent."
"Likewise,  the  testimony  of  Appellants’  other  witnesses,  D.  Casi  Vishwanadan  (Store"
"Keeper) 
and  Wanasundara  Mudiyanselage 
Susantha  Wanasundara 
(Assistant"
"Superintendent),  only  confirmed  the  flour  shortage  and  the  initiation  of  disciplinary"
"proceedings against the Respondent, without proving misconduct."
"Upon an overall consideration of the evidence  led in LT, I observe that the Appellants"
"have failed to present strong, conclusive evidence before LT to justify the termination of"
"the services of the Respondent. The Appellants have not provided compelling, definitive"
"evidence before the LT to demonstrate that the Respondent’s admission of the shortage of"
"flour  amounts  to  misconduct.  Multiple  charges  were  brought  against  the  Respondent,"
"including accusations of deceiving management and workers by creating a falsified list and"
"recording fictitious flour allocations totalling 110 kilograms, which were submitted to the"
"estate office for salary deductions without actual distribution. However, I find insufficient"
