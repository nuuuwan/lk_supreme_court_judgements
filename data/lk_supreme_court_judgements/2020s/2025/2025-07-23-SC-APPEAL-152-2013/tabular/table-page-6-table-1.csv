"on him once the financial loss to the Appellant has been compensated through deductions"
"from his salary."
"Applicability of the Maxim"
"The maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa is a Latin term which implies that"
"'nobody should be twice troubled or jeopardized for one and the same matter'. The basis"
"of res judicata in the civil law and of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict in the criminal law."
"An accused is normally limited to pleading guilty or not guilty, but if he contends that he"
"has already been acquitted or convicted on exactly the same charge or facts, he may offer"
"whichever of these pleas is appropriate (Vide - Lawyers’ Latin: A Vade Mecum by John"
"Gray)1.  Res  judicata  'a  matter  which  has  been  adjudicated  upon'.  If  a  claimant  seeks  to"
"litigate a claim all over again, then a defendant may answer it with the plea res judicata,"
"exactly the same matter has been decided already2. The doctrine of res judicata rests upon"
"twin principles which cannot be better expressed than in the terms of the two Latin maxims"
"interest republicae ut sit finis litium3 and nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa.4"
"Despite the Labour Tribunal and the High Court addressing the maxim nemo debet bis vexari"
"pro una et eadem causa, this Court did not grant leave on the question of whether the learned"
"High Court Judge erred in law by finding the Respondent’s termination to be in violation"
"of  this  maxim.  Nevertheless,  for  the  sake  of  completeness,  I  must  state  that  the  above"
"explicit definition of such maxim does not reflect any logical basis for applying the same"
"to  the  circumstances  of  the  case  before  the  LT.  It  is  stated  in  Law  of  Delict  by  R.G."
"Mckerron5  that  crime  and  delict  must  be  regarded  as  complementary,  not  mutually"
"exclusive,  conceptions,  and  can  only  be  distinguished  by  having  regard  to  the  different"
"nature of criminal and civil proceedings. It is further stated that the purpose of these two"
"classes  of  proceedings  is  fundamentally  different  and  the  primary  object  of  criminal"
"proceedings is the punishment of the accused; the primary object of civil proceedings is"
"the enforcement of a right claimed by the plaintiff against the defendant."
