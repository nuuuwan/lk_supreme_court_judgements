Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Mallakam seeking

a declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the plaint,

ejectment of the defendant therefrom, and damages. The defendant did not

challenge that the plaintiff is the owner of the land. His position was that

he is a bona fide possessor who entered into possession with the leave and

licence of the plaintiff’s predecessor in title, one Ampalanathan, and that he

has been residing on the land since 1992 after constructing a house

thereon. The defendant claimed that he is entitled to remain in possession

until a sum of Rs. 750,000 is paid to him as compensation for the

improvements made by constructing the said house.

At the trial, the said Ampalanathan gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff.

He testified that the defendant and his family, together with many others,

had been displaced, most likely due to the civil disturbances prevailing at

that time in the North, and were temporarily accommodated in a temple.

After some time, they were requested to vacate the temple. With the consent

of the new owner of the land, to whom Ampalanathan had sold the property,

the defendant was permitted to occupy the land in suit for a period of six

months. Initially, a temporary hut was erected, but thereafter, without any

permission from Ampalanathan or his successors in title, the defendant

proceeded to construct the existing house. This evidence directly

contradicts the defendant’s assertion that he was a bona fide possessor

throughout the period of his occupation. The District Court accepted the

testimony of Ampalanathan and rejected the version put forward by the

defendant.

The main question that arises for consideration is whether the defendant is

entitled to compensation for the improvements effected on the land. Upon

conclusion of the trial, the District Court declared that the plaintiff is the

lawful owner of the land, but nevertheless awarded the defendant a sum of

3

SC/APPEAL/138/2015

Rs. 400,000 as compensation for the improvements. It is this award of

compensation that forms the principal matter in controversy before the High

Court and this Court.

On appeal by the plaintiff, the High Court of Civil Appeal set aside the order

awarding compensation, holding that the defendant had not established

that he was a bona fide possessor so as to be entitled to compensation for

improvements. The High Court further observed that, in any event, there

was no evidence upon which the District Court could have determined the

quantum of compensation.

It is against this judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal that the

defendant has preferred the present appeal. A previous Bench of this Court

had granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law:

(a) Did the plaintiff as owner of the land allow the defendant to carry out

necessary improvements on the land?

(b) Did the High Court fail to consider the fact that the defendant carried

out the improvements in the honest belief that he was entitled to do so

under the law?

(c) Can the plaintiff take advantage without making compensation for

improvements effected by the defendant in good faith believing himself

to be entitled to enjoy them for a term or in perpetuity?

On the facts and circumstances of this case, I am in agreement with the

finding of the High Court that the defendant cannot be regarded as a bona

fide possessor beyond the expiry of the six-month period during which he

was permitted to occupy the land as a matter of goodwill, given that he and

his family had no other place to go and had been stranded at the time.

Although he was requested to vacate the land at the end of that period, he

failed to do so and continued in unlawful possession. Thereafter, his

4

SC/APPEAL/138/2015

occupation was mala fide, and he accordingly forfeited any claim to the

rights of a bona fide possessor.

A mala fide possessor is one who occupies or exercises control over property

in bad faith, knowing that he has no valid title or lawful right to do so, or

being in circumstances where he cannot reasonably claim ignorance of its

unlawfulness. By contrast, a bona fide possessor is one who, under an

honest and genuine belief founded upon reasonable justification, assumes

possession of property in the mistaken impression that he has a valid title

or right to do so. The distinction is critical, for the law affords protection

and certain equitable remedies to bona fide possessors, while denying such

benefits to those whose possession is tainted by mala fides.

Roman-Dutch law classifies improvements into three categories: necessary

improvements (impensae necessariae), useful improvements (impensae

utiles), and ornamental improvements (impensae voluptuariae). Necessary

improvements are those essential for the preservation or protection of the

property, without which the property would inevitably deteriorate. For

instance, repairing a boundary wall to prevent collapse, installing a roof to

protect a building from ruin, or constructing drainage to avert flooding.

However, this category should be understood subject to the condition that

the owner in fact intended to preserve the property. If the owner did not

intend to preserve the property, the expenditure cannot be regarded as a

necessary improvement. Thus, if a possessor repaired a crumbling roof of a

house which the owner nevertheless intended to demolish and replace with

a new house, such repairs would not constitute an improvement at all.

Useful improvements are those that, while not indispensable, substantially

enhance the value, productivity, or reasonable utility of the property, such

as putting up a permanent dwelling on vacant land, building an irrigation

system to increase agricultural yield, or adding rooms to a house to make

it more functional. Ornamental improvements are those made merely for

5

SC/APPEAL/138/2015

decoration, luxury, or personal gratification, such as constructing a

fountain, carrying out elaborate landscaping, or erecting decorative pillars.

As a general rule, the right to claim compensation for improvements is

confined to bona fide possessors having civilis possessio, and does not

extend to mala fide possessors. Only bona fide possessors are entitled to

exercise the right of retention (ius retentionis) until compensation is paid.

Where improvements are necessary improvements (impensae necessariae),

both bona fide and mala fide possessors are entitled to compensation, since

such improvements preserve the very existence of the property, provided

that the owner intended its preservation. Where improvements are useful

(impensae utiles), only the bona fide possessor is entitled to compensation,

unless the true owner, with full knowledge of the improvements, has stood

by and allowed them without objection, in which event the doctrine of

unjust enrichment, grounded in equity, may permit compensation even to

a mala fide possessor. It may be relevant to note that the Roman-Dutch

jurists are divided on payment for useful improvements: Groenewegen, Van

Leeuwen, Voet, and Schorer maintain that a mala fide possessor is entitled

to compensation for useful improvements, whereas Grotius and Van der

Keessel take the opposite view. As a general principle, where the

improvements are ornamental or superfluous (impensae voluptuariae), no

compensation is payable.

In a rei vindicatio action, once paper title of the plaintiff is admitted or

proved, the defendant shall prove on what right he is in possession of the

property. The burden rests on the defendant to establish the amount of

compensation, which shall be limited to either the enhanced value of the

land attributable to the improvements or the actual cost incurred in

effecting them, whichever is the lesser.

Whatever the nature of the improvement, the owner cannot be compelled to

accept improvements against his will and thereby be forced to pay

compensation. If the owner does not need improvements, the improver may

be allowed to exercise the right of removal (ius tollendi), provided this can

be done without causing material injury to the property, and subject to

restoring the property to its original condition. The principle rests on the

equitable notion that, while an owner cannot be compelled to accept and

pay for improvements he does not desire, neither should a bona fide

possessor be deprived altogether of the benefit of his expenditure. The ius

retentionis and the ius tollendi thus operate as complementary doctrines:

the former ensures fairness to the bona fide possessor by securing

compensation for necessary improvements or useful improvements which

the owner elects to retain, while the latter safeguards the owner’s autonomy

by preventing the imposition of unwanted improvements upon his property.

Enrichment in South Africa and Ceylon (1972), pages 11-69.

In Sirisena Navalage v. Kalawana [2012] 2 Sri LR 98, Dep J. (as he then

was), at 107–108, observed:

As he was not a bona fide possessor he is not entitled to any

compensation. He had been in occupation of the land unlawfully for

more than two decades and he would have reaped the benefit of the

improvements carried out by him at his own risk. Therefore, I hold that

the Defendant is not entitled to any compensation for the

improvements.

SC/APPEAL/138/2015

In Wanigaratne v. Wanigaratne [1997] 2 Sri LR 267 at 271-272, Edussuriya

J. noted:

In this case the appellants are not bona fide possessors as it was

decided that the respondent’s predecessor in title (the father) had never

led the appellants to believe that this property would be given to them,

and therefore the respondent cannot be ordered to pay compensation

for buildings which were constructed by the appellants who are mala

fide possessors.

Further trespassers cannot foist on the owner what they consider to be

necessary improvements, done without the owner’s consent and claim

compensation. It could well be that the owner had other plans and may

have to demolish the “improvements” effected by the trespassers

because they are not necessary improvements. Besides there is no

evidence that they are necessary improvements. If Courts of Law were

to hold that owners of land should pay compensation to trespassers

who have put up buildings thereon, then we would be paving the way

for trespassers to build as they like, because at the end of the day they

can walk away with compensation, after having been in forcible

possession for a period of years and having rented out such buildings

and earned thereby, as in this case.

In the same case, Senanayake J. at pages 274-275 added:

In the instant case the appellants were trespassers on the land,

therefore they were mala fide possessors. It is well settled law and

decided in the case of The General Tea Estates Co. Ltd. v. Pulle 9 NLR

98 that a mala fide possessor was not entitled under the Roman Dutch

Law, as administered in Ceylon to compensation for impensa utiles.

Pereira Acting Puisne Justice observed in a case reported in 2

Balasingham’s Report 149 “a mala fide possessor is one who

8

SC/APPEAL/138/2015

possesses well knowing that he has no right to do so in as much as the

property possessed belongs to another and it would be unreasonable

to allow him to force on the true owner improvements which very useful

though they be are effected according to his own taste or whims and

his fancy and may be such as the true owner himself would never have

cared to effect.”

More recently, in Susiripala v. Sumanawathie (SC/APPEAL/61/2014, SC

Minutes of 20.01.2022), I restated the principle in the following terms:

Only bona fide possessors are entitled to compensation for useful

improvements and the ius retentionis (right of retention) is available to

them until compensation is paid by the owner. Even if the defendant is

a bona fide possessor, the plaintiff does not want the buildings on the

land perhaps because she does not have the financial capacity to pay

compensation. The buildings cannot be thrust upon her and she cannot

be compelled to pay compensation to the defendant. The High Court

allowed the defendant to remove the buildings. The ius tollendi (right

to remove improvements) is available to the improver when

compensation cannot be awarded.

The appeal before us falls squarely within this established framework. In

the present case, the defendant has been in unlawful occupation at least

since 1993. The defendant, not being a bona fide possessor beyond the

period of permissive occupation, cannot compel the plaintiff to accept or

pay for the so-called useful improvements. As the plaintiff does not desire

to retain the improvements, the defendant’s entitlement, even assuming

arguendo that he were to be regarded as a bona fide possessor, extends only

to the ius tollendi—the right to remove the improvements—provided that

such removal can be done without causing material injury to the land.

Equity cannot be invoked to shield a wrongdoer or to impose an

unwarranted burden upon the true owner.

9

SC/APPEAL/138/2015

I answer the questions of law raised in this appeal against the defendant.

I affirm the judgment of the High Court and dismiss the appeal subject to

the condition that the defendant may remove the improvements without

causing material injury to the land and hand over vacant possession of the

land to the plaintiff on or before 28.02.2026. In the event of failure to

comply, the plaintiff shall be entitled to obtain writ to eject the defendant

and all those holding under him forthwith.
