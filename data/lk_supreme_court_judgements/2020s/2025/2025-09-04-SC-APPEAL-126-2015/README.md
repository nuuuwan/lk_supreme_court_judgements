Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the plaintiff-appellant-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the plaintiff) on the basis of being aggrieved of the judgment

pronounced on 10-06-2014 by the Court of Appeal.

From the said judgment, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal preferred

by her in order to challenge the judgment pronounced by the learned District

Judge of Gampaha on 27-02-1998, where the action instituted by the plaintiff

seeking a declaration of title to the land morefully described in the plaint and

for other incidental reliefs was dismissed after trial.

When this matter was supported before this Court on 21-07-2015 for the

granting of Leave to Appeal, this Court, having considered the relevant facts,

circumstances and the law, granted Leave to Appeal on the following

questions of law, as averred in paragraph 14 of the petition filed before the

Court.

1. Has His Lordship of the Court of Appeal erred in law by failing to

consider that in terms of section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance the

respondents causes of action inter alia based on Laesio Enormis, were

prescribed as they have not claimed relief within 3 years of the date of

the execution of the disputed deed No. 1449.

2. Has His Lordship of the Court of Appeal erred in law by failing to

consider that the plaintiff is a bona fide purchaser of the land in suit

and that she was not a party to any transaction with the respondents.

3. Has His Lordship erred in law by failing to consider that the plea of

Laesio Enormis is not available against a subsequent purchaser of the

property and could only be made against the purchase from the seller.

4. Has His Lordship failed to consider that the 2nd defendant-respondent

in her evidence at the trial has stated that at the time she executed the

said deed No. 1449, she was very much aware of the true value of the

property and therefore the plea of Laesio Enormis is not available to a

person who knows the value of the property at the time of the sale even

Page 5 of 19

if (which is denied), the price at which she has sold the property is less

than half of its true value.

5. Has His Lordship erred by failing to consider that the respondents had

waited for 6 years without taking any action in relation to the property

in suit and only took steps when this action was filed in the District

Court of Gampaha by the petitioner and also did not provide any

explanation for not taking any such action at the trial.

6. Has His Lordship erred in law by failing to consider that the

respondents are trying to contradict and show that deed No. 1449 was

not a transfer deed, but in actual fact was a deed of mortgage when

such evidence could not be admitted as per section 92 of Evidence

Ordinance.

At the hearing of this appeal, this Court heard the submissions of the learned

Presidents Counsel on behalf of the plaintiff and the submissions made by

the learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the substituted defendants-

respondents-respondents (hereinafter referred to as the substituted

defendants). This Court also had the benefit of considering the written

submissions tendered by the parties in this regard.

This is a matter where the plaintiff has instituted an action before the District

Court of Gampaha for a declaration of title of the land morefully described in

the schedule of the plaint, and for an interim injunction among other

incidental reliefs.

The land in suit has been described as Lot 1 and 4 of the plan No. 256 dated

21-03-1975 by K. G. Hubert Perera, Licensed Surveyor (the plan marked as

P-01 at the trial).

It needs to be noted that the plaintiff has not sought an ejectment of the

defendants mentioned from the said land on the basis that the plaintiff is in

possession of the land in question.

In the above-mentioned plan marked P-01, Lot 1 has been described as a land

of 01 rood 17.1 perches in extent, and Lot 4, which is the access road provided

Page 6 of 19

for the said land from the main road, has been described as a land of 1.34

perches in extent.

In her plaint, the plaintiff has averred her cause of action on the basis that

the defendants who are in possession of Lot 2 of the same plan caused

obstructions to the common Southern boundary between Lot 1 and Lot 2.

Pleading her title to the property, the plaintiff has stated that the 2nd

defendant named in the action sold the land to one Francis Paul Kingsley Dias

by deed No. 1449 dated 10-05-1993, and upon said Diass demise, his heirs

transferred the said rights to the plaintiff by deed No. 7490 dated 09-07-1998,

whereby she became the owner of the property.

The defendants filing their answer on 24-05-1989 has admitted the execution

of deed No. 1449 as a deed of transfer, but has claimed that in fact what

occurred between the parties was only a loan transaction where the land was

pledged as security, and therefore, no title can pass on to the plaintiff.

They have also averred that the land in question is much more valuable than

the stated consideration in the deed. They have claimed that on the basis of

the principle of Laesio Enormis, they are entitled to get the said deed No. 1449

to be declared null and void.

At the trial before the District Court, the parties had admitted that the 2nd

defendant was a previous owner of the land mentioned in the schedule of the

plaint, and the fact of execution of the deed No. 1449 dated 10-05-1993 by

Notary Public K. K. Wijegunaratne.

Based on the above admissions, the plaintiff has raised 2 issues on the basis

of her title, and if her title is proved, whether she can obtain a judgment as

prayed for in her plaint.

The defendants have raised issue No. 3 to 7, which reads as follows.

3. . 1449

4.

Page 7 of 19

5. 5

6. . 1449

7. 13 Laesio Enormis

. 1449

The above admissions and issues had been recorded on 05-09-1989 and the

trial has commenced on 02-01-1990. Halfway through the trial, while

plaintiffs witness Charlotte Jayasinghe, the wife of Kingsley Dias who

transferred the inherited rights in relation to the land along with her children

to the plaintiff, was giving evidence, the learned Counsel who represented the

defendants had raised the following additional issues which had been

accepted by Court.

10.

11. ,

In his judgment dated 22-02-1998, the learned Additional District Judge of

Gampaha has answered the issues raised by the plaintiff in the negative, and

all the issues raised by the defendants in their favour. The learned District

Judge appears to have determined that the deed of transfer upon which the

plaintiff relied on to claim the title to the property was in fact a mortgage, and

thereby accepting the defendants evidence to that effect. The learned District

Judge has also determined that the plaintiffs predecessors in title could not

have executed the deed of transfer in favour of the plaintiff since no

Page 8 of 19

testamentary action has been initiated as to the estate of the deceased

Kingsley Dias who became the owner of the land upon deed No. 1449.

However, it is clear that the primary reason for allowing the counter claim

made by the defendants had been on the basis of Laesio Enormis.

Since the questions of law upon which Leave to Appeal was granted by this

Court revolves around the questions of whether the defendants of the action

had a basis to claim reliefs on the basis of Laesio Enormis, and whether a deed

of transfer can be interpreted as a mortgage in the manner it has been

determined by the learned District Judge as well as the Court of Appeal, I will

focus my judgment on the said questions of law.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel who represented the

plaintiff that the plaintiff has only sought a declaration of title and not

ejectment because the plaintiffs possession of the land was never disturbed,

other than the disruption of the Southern boundary of the land. It was

submitted that the defendants took up their respective positions only in their

answer dated 24-05-1989 praying for the setting aside of the deed marked P-

03, namely deed No. 1449, where the 2nd defendant has sold the land in

question to Kinsley Dias, noting that the defendants had not challenged the

deed upon which the plaintiff obtained title from the heirs of the said Dias,

namely deed No. 7490 dated 09-07-1988, marked P-02 at the trial.

He went on to submit that in terms of section 10 of the Prescription

Ordinance, an action on the basis of Laesio Enormis has to be initiated within

3 years from the cause of action, whereas the defendants have pleaded Laesio

Enormis only in their answer filed more than 6 years after the execution of the

questioned deed. Submitting as to the facts pointing towards the

consideration mentioned in the deeds produced before the Court and the

evidence of the 2nd defendant where she has claimed that the transaction was

not an actual transfer, it was pointed out that the evidence has established

the fact that the 2nd defendant knew that she was selling the land for a lesser

sum than the actual value she claimed at the time of the execution of the said

deed.

Page 9 of 19

Citing relevant judgments pronounced in this regard by our Superior Courts,

it was contended that under such circumstances, a claim of Laesio Enormis

cannot be maintained.

Referring to the provisions of section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance, it was his

position that since no exception was pleaded as required, and no constructive

trust has been pleaded other than a mere statement, there was no basis before

the District Court or the Court of Appeal to make a determination as to the

validity of the deed of transfer upon which the 2nd defendant has sold the land

to Kingsley Dias. It was his position that the plaintiff was a bona fide buyer

who had nothing to do with the transaction between the 2nd defendant and

Kingsley Dias, where her deed was never challenged. It was submitted that

both the original Court and the Court of Appeal erred in law when both the

Courts decided to dismiss the plaint and to grant relief based on the counter

claim of the defendants.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel who represented the

substituted defendants that the fact of selling the land by the 2nd defendant

to Kingsley Dias only as a security for a loan has been well established before

the trial Court. He pointed out that the plaintiff has failed to file any

replication before the trial Court challenging the position taken up by the

defendants. It was also argued that the prescription claim as to the plea of

Laesio Enormis is a matter that was raised for the first time in the Supreme

Court. It was his position that this was not a matter where patent lack of

jurisdiction can be claimed, and since the prescription has not been pleaded

previously, it has to be assumed that the plaintiff has waived such a claim.

It was contented further that the 2nd defendant never admitted in her evidence

that she knew the value of the property, but her position was that she never

sold it.

Pointing towards the valuation reports obtained by the defendants in relation

to the land in question, the learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the

actual value of the land was much more than the value for which the land

had been sold to Kingsley Dias.

Page 10 of 19

The learned Presidents Counsel admitted that the deed upon which the 2nd

defendant has sold the land to Kingsley Dias has been annulled by the Court

on the basis of Laesio Enormis. He also brought to the attention of the Court

that His Lordship of the Court of Appeal has decided to disallow the damages

awarded by the trial Judge to the plaintiff since there was no prayer before

the Court seeking any damages.

In this context, it needs to be noted that in the Court of Appeal judgment, the

determination had been that the learned District Judge has decided to revoke

the deed marked P-03 (deed No.1449 dated 10-05-1993) on the basis that no

proper consideration had been passed to the vendor in that deed.

It was on that basis the Court of Appeal has proceeded to consider whether

the said deed is in fact an outright transfer or not. It had been determined

that even if it can be considered as a transfer, the deed can be annulled on

the basis of Laesio Enormis. It has also been determined that the plaintiff

cannot claim title based on the deed marked P-02, namely deed No. 7490

dated 09-07-1998.

Having in mind the above factual matrix and the relevant law, and also the

questions of law upon which Leave to Appeal was granted, I will now proceed

to consider the appeal.

The action initiated by the plaintiff is a vindicatory suit where she has sought

for a declaration of title to the land morefully described in the schedule of the

plaint, but not ejectment.

In such a situation, the onus is on the plaintiff to identify the corpus of the

action and to prove her title to the same. Once a plaintiff establishes the

necessary ingredients that needs to be proved in such a suit, the burden shifts

to the defendant to show that he has a better title or claim to the land than

that of the plaintiff.

In the District Court judgment, I do not find anything to satisfy that the

learned District Judge has proceeded to consider whether the plaintiff has

proved at least paper title to the land mentioned in the schedule of the plaint,

or whether the corpus has been identified.

Page 11 of 19

After summarizing what the plaintiff and the defendants have stated in their

respective plaint and answer, and narrating the admissions and the issues,

the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha has proceeded straight

away to consider the stand taken up by the defendants to claim that the

transaction was not in fact a transfer of a land, but a security for a loan

obtained, and the relevant claim of Laesio Enormis, before proceeding to

dismiss the action of the plaintiff and grant relief as sought by the defendants.

I am also unable to find that the Court of Appeal has considered this legal

aspect in the Court of Appeal judgment where the judgment of the District

Court was affirmed. I find that His Lordship of the Court of Appeal has only

considered the judgment of the District Court in order to justify granting of

relief to the defendants by the learned Additional District Judge.

Under these circumstances, I find it relevant to consider the 6th question of

law under which Leave to Appeal was granted by this Court before considering

the other questions of law. The 6th question of law relates to whether the

learned District Judge, as well as the Court of Appeal, was correct in the way

the validity of the deed of transfer that was challenged before the District

Court was determined.

There cannot be any dispute that the said deed No. 1449 marked P-03 at the

trial was an outright deed of transfer by the 2nd defendant of the action,

namely Hewapathiranahelage Emalin, to Francis Paul Kingsley Dias for a sum

of Rs. 18,000/-. In the notarial certificate, the Notary has clearly stated that

the said sum was transacted before him.

I am of the view that this is a situation where the provisions of section 92 of

the Evidence Ordinance are clearly applicable.

Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance, which has 6 provisos attached to it

reads as follows.

92. When the terms of any such contract, grant, or other

disposition or property, or any matter required by law to be

reduced to the form of a document, have been proved according to

the last section, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement

Page 12 of 19

shall be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument,

or their representatives in interest, for the purpose of

contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms.

The provisos to the section provide for conditions under which the effects of

such a document can be challenged.

In the case of B. M. G. Setuwa Vs. B. T. Ukku 56 NLR 337 it was held that

it is never open to a party who executes a conveyance which is unambiguously

a deed of sale to lead parole evidence to show that in reality it is a deed of

mortgage and not sale. This rule equally applies where there is an agreement

in the deed itself whereby the vendee undertakes to re-transfer the property

for consideration within a specified period, and also where there is a separate

agreement to the same effect, whether notarial, or not.

Per Gratiaen, J.,

The respondent did not rely on any proviso to section 92 of The Evidence

Ordinance. Nor did he allege a trust of the kind which section 5 (3) of the

Trusts Ordinance permits to be established by oral evidence. In the result,

the learned trial Judge should not have admitted evidence for the purpose

of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from the terms of two

notarial instruments each of which unambiguously purported to record a

transaction between a vendor and his purchase (not between a

mortgagor and his mortgagee).

In my view, the only way the defendants could have challenged the said deed

of transfer would have been by pleading that although a deed of transfer was

executed, the real purpose was not to pass beneficial interest of the property,

but only as a security for a loan, by claiming the benefits of a constructive

trust in terms of section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance.

I find that what the defendants have done in this action had been to make

mere oral statements as to the intention of the parties, or to claim that the

full consideration was not passed despite the fact that the deed of transfer

speaks otherwise. It is my considered view that if a deed of transfer can be

allowed to be challenged in the manner in which the Court held in favour of

Page 13 of 19

the defendants, there can be no certainty in such transactions. At no point in

the answer of the defendants or by way of issues, the defendants have claimed

a constructive trust.

The evidence clearly shows that after the execution of the deed of transfer, the

possession of the land had been handed over to the purchaser of the property,

and it was on that basis the heirs of Kingsley Dias had transferred their

inherited rights of the property to the plaintiff by the deed marked P-02. There

was no evidence before the Court to suggest that the vendor allowed the

vendee to enjoy the property in lieu of interest of the loan as claimed by the

defendants.

If it was the contention of the defendants that the transaction was not an

outright sale, they should have filed an action before a competent Court

claiming rights on the basis of a constructive trust for a declaration claiming

reliefs on that basis. The defendants have clearly slept over their rights until

the plaintiff decided to file an action to obtain a declaration of title to the land,

and had thought it fit to claim that the transaction upon which the plaintiffs

predecessors in title obtained their rights was not an actual transfer.

Under these circumstances, it is my considered view that there was no basis

to consider the defendants counter claim that the transaction was not an

outright transfer in terms of the provisos of section 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance. Hence, I hold that both the Courts have erred in law when it was

determined that the deed marked P-03 was not an actual deed of transfer,

whereas it was.

Having said that, I will now proceed to consider the other questions of law

which revolves around whether there is any justification of the decision to

annul the deed of transfer marked P-03, under which the plaintiff had claimed

title.

The prescriptive period for one to claim benefit under the principle of Laesio

Enormis is not a matter expressly provided for under the provisions of the

Prescription Ordinance. As correctly pointed out by the learned Presidents

Page 14 of 19

Counsel for the plaintiff, in such circumstances, it is the provisions of section

10 of the Prescription Ordinance that should be considered applicable.

The said section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance reads as follows.

10. No action shall be maintainable in respect of any cause of

action not hearing before expressly provided for or expressly

exempted from the operation of this Ordinance, unless the same

shall be commenced within 3 years from the time when such cause

of action shall have accrued.

As I have stated before, the defendants have only claimed Laesio Enormis in

the answer they filed in response to the action initiated by the plaintiff more

than 6 years after the execution of the deed marked P-03, which clearly is a

claim that has been long prescribed in terms of the Prescription Ordinance.

In the case of Gunasekara Vs. Wickremasinghe (2005) 1 SLR 390, the

plaintiff-appellant transferred the property in question with the right of re-

purchase within a period of 1 year. The date of execution of the conditional

transfer deed was 17-09-1987, the date of institution of action had been on

14-06-1993, which was 6 years after the execution of the said deed. The

plaintiff-appellant sought to set aside the said deed based on the principles of

Laesio Enormis. The trial Court dismissed the plaintiffs action stating that it

is time barred.

Per Andrew Somawansa, J., P/CA

It is to be seen that Laesio Enormis is not a matter that is specifically

covered by any of the sections contained in the Prescription Ordinance.

Certainly, neither section 3, 5 or 6 would be applicable to this concept.

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance deals with the lands or immovable

property. Section 5 deals with mortgage, debt, or bond and Section 6

deals with partnership, deeds, written promise, contract, bargain,

agreement, security, promissory notes, bills of exchange, etc. Thus, it is

to be seen that the applicable section would be Section 10 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

Page 15 of 19

Although, the learned Presidents Counsel for the substituted defendants

submitted that the question of prescription has been taken up for the first

time only before the Supreme Court and it cannot be taken up in such a

manner, I do not agree. I am of the view that this is a question of law that

needs determination as it has been allowed by this Court when formulating

the questions of law under which this appeal would be considered.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the defendants

claim of Laesio Enormis before the District Court was clearly prescribed in

terms of law. However, I am in agreement with the learned Presidents Counsel

that the question of prescription is not a matter where patent want of

jurisdiction can be asserted, but a latent want of jurisdiction, which can be

waived by the conduct of the parties.

Although the matter under appeal is not an action initiated by the defendants

on the basis of Laesio Enormis, when this position was taken up by the

defendants, the plaintiff has thought it fit not to raise an issue based on

prescription at the trial, though if raised, the claim of Laesio Enormis would

clearly be prescribed under the facts and circumstances of the case. Since

this was a matter that has not been raised or required to be considered before

the trial Court or before the Court of Appeal for that matter, I am of the view

that the question of prescription is a matter that has been waived off by the

conduct of the plaintiff, and a matter that cannot be taken up for the first

time at the hearing of this appeal, although a question of law has been raised

before this Court in that regard.

However, it is my considered view that when considering the principle of

Laesio Enormis, the delay and the conduct of the party who claims benefits

under the principle of Laesio Enormis is very much a relevant factor. The

defendants who claimed the benefit of Laesio Enormis have not initiated any

legal proceedings on such a basis until they were required to file an answer

to the plaint preferred by the plaintiff, which was a claim made more than 6

years after the execution of the deed marked P-03. Under such circumstances,

I am of the view that the defendants were not entitled to take up such a

Page 16 of 19

position since they have not gone before a Court of law seeking a remedy

without undue delay.

It is also a well settled principle of law that a plea of Laesio Enormis is not

available against a subsequent purchaser of the land, but a claim that can

only be made against the person who purchased the land from the original

vendor. The plaintiff of the action is not a person who purchased the land

from the original vendor, but a third party who purchased it from the heirs of

the original owner. The plaintiff has had no connection whatsoever to the

original transaction where the benefit of Laesio Enormis had been claimed by

the defendants.

This question as well as the question of delay in claiming reliefs in terms of

the principle of Laesio Enormis was well considered in the case of Podi Menika

Vs. Heen Menike (2004) 3 SLR 289, where it was held,

1. The principle of Roman-Dutch law is to remedy injustice caused to a

seller of a thing due to his ignorance or lack of knowledge. This principle

could not apply to a situation where the seller was aware of the true

value of the property at the time of execution of the deed.

2. A transferor who institutes an action on the principle of Laesio Enormis

has to do so without delay. The principle of Laesio Enormis is available

as against a transferee of a deed and not against a 3rd party who had

become entitled to the property on a deed granted by the transferee.

Per Dissanayake, J.,

Laesio Enormis has been described by Grotius as: if the seller or

purchaser has been prejudiced in the price to the extent of more than half

the real value, even though no fraud has been perpetrated on either side

the party so prejudiced may give the other the option of either cancelling

the sale or of increasing or reducing the price in accordance with the real

value. This mode of restitution applies to almost all contracts. Grot 3 (17-

1-5).

Page 17 of 19

Laesio Enormis is a well-recognised principle in the Roman-Dutch law to

remedy injustice caused to a seller of a thing due to his ignorance or lack

of knowledge.

This principle will not apply to a situation where the seller was aware of

the true value of the property at the time of the execution of the deed,

however the property was sold at a lesser price.

The remedy available to an aggrieved party under this principle is not

confined to cancellation of the contract but also damages. In such a

situation the contract is not void but is voidable. Therefore, a transferor

who institutes an action on the principle of Laesio Enormis has to do so

without delay. The principle of Laesio Enormis is available as against a

transferee of a deed and not against a third party who had become

entitled to the property on a deed granted by the transferee.

In the case of Jayawardene Vs. Amarasekara 15 NLR 280, which was a

case where the principle of Laesio Enormis was considered;

Per Lascelles, C.J.,

It is clear to me that the plaintiff cannot possibly succeed on her claim to

have the sale cancelled on the ground of enormis laesio. I agree with the

learned District Judge that the evidence by which it is sought to prove

that the lands were sold for less than half their true value is far from

convincing. But even assuming this to have been proved, the plaintiff

would not necessarily be entitled to the benefit of the doctrine of enormis

laesio. It is not the law that where a proprietor, who is in a position to

know the value of his property, sells it for less than half of what is

afterwards held to be its true value, he is entitled to come into Court and

claim rescission.

In the case of Menik Ethana Vs. Kiri Appu 29 NLR 381, it was held;

At the trial the appellant did not press the question of the trust. There

was therefore only the claim on the grounds of laesio enormis, and the

learned District Judge held that such a claim would not be made as the

Page 18 of 19

appellant did not allege that she was not aware of the real value of the

land, and, further, that on the averments in the plaint there was sufficient

consideration. He therefore dismissed the action. The appeal is from this

judgment.

The judgment of the learned District Judge is right. The transaction as it

was described in the plaint was not a sale; according to the sale no sum

of Rs. 300/- passed, nor apparently was it intended to passed; it was a

transfer in trust for the appellant, and the doctrine of laesio enormis has

no application in such a case.

The above line of authority clearly establishes that to claim Laesio Enormis,

the person who sells the land to another must have the intention to sell the

land, but due to the facts and the circumstances, the seller could not have

known the true value of the land. It has to be established that as a result, he

sold it for less than half of its actual value.

However, in the matter under the appeal, the position taken up by the

defendants before the trial Court had been that the 2nd defendant never had

the intention of selling the land to Kingsley Dias, but she only entered into

the transaction to secure a loan obtained by her from the said Dias.

It is my considered view that under such circumstances, there cannot be a

basis for the defendants to claim the benefit of the principle of Laesio Enormis.

As pleaded by they themselves, the intention of the 2nd defendant was not to

sell the land. The evidence led on behalf of the defendants at the trial had

been to the effect that they very well knew the value of the land when the 2nd

defendant executed the deed marked P-03 in favour of Kingsley Dias.

It is my view that under the said circumstances, the defendants cannot have

had the benefit of the principle of Laesio Enormis as determined by the learned

Additional District Judge as well as His Lordship of the Court of Appeal.

As the evidence clearly demonstrates, the plaintiff was not the party who

purchased the land from the 2nd defendant who claimed the benefit of Laesio

Enormis before the District Court. She is a bona fide purchaser of the land

from the heirs of Kinglsey Dias for a valuable consideration that fits the value

of the land under given circumstances. Hence, it is my view that the principle

of Laesio Enormis cannot be made use of against the plaintiff of the action.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the judgment

pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha, as well as

the judgment pronounced by the Court of Appeal cannot be allowed to stand,

as the said judgments are judgments pronounced without giving due

considerations to the relevant principles under which the relief has been

granted in favour of the defendants of the action.

Accordingly, I answer the 1st question of law in the negative, and all the other

5 questions of law in the affirmative.

The judgment dated 27-02-1998 pronounced by the learned Additional

District Judge of Gampaha and the judgment dated 10-06-2014 pronounced

by the Court of Appeal is hereby set aside.

Allowing the appeal, I hold that the plaintiff is entitled to the reliefs () and ()

of her plaint dated 17-08-1988.

The appeal is allowed. There will be no costs of the appeal.
