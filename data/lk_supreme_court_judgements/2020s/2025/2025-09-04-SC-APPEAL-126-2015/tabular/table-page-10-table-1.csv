"The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel admitted that the deed upon which the 2nd"
"defendant has sold the land to Kingsley Dias has been annulled by the Court"
"on the basis of Laesio Enormis. He also brought to the attention of the Court"
"that His Lordship of the Court of Appeal has decided to disallow the damages"
"awarded by the trial Judge to the plaintiff since there was no prayer before"
"the Court seeking any damages."
"In this context, it needs to be noted that in the Court of Appeal judgment, the"
"determination had been that the learned District Judge has decided to revoke"
"the deed marked P-03 (deed No.1449 dated 10-05-1993) on the basis that no"
"proper consideration had been passed to the vendor in that deed."
"It was on that basis the Court of Appeal has proceeded to consider whether"
"the said deed is in fact an outright transfer or not. It had been determined"
"that even if it can be considered as a transfer, the deed can be annulled on"
"the  basis  of  Laesio  Enormis.  It  has  also  been  determined  that  the  plaintiff"
"cannot  claim  title  based  on  the  deed  marked  P-02,  namely  deed  No.  7490"
"dated 09-07-1998."
"Having in mind the above factual matrix and the relevant law, and also the"
"questions of law upon which Leave to Appeal was granted, I will now proceed"
"to consider the appeal."
"The action initiated by the plaintiff is a vindicatory suit where she has sought"
"for a declaration of title to the land morefully described in the schedule of the"
"plaint, but not ejectment."
"In such a situation, the onus is on the plaintiff to identify the corpus of the"
"action  and  to  prove  her  title  to  the  same.  Once  a  plaintiff  establishes  the"
"necessary ingredients that needs to be proved in such a suit, the burden shifts"
"to the defendant to show that he has a better title or claim to the land than"
"that of the plaintiff."
"In  the  District  Court  judgment,  I  do  not  find  anything  to  satisfy  that  the"
"learned  District  Judge  has  proceeded  to  consider  whether  the  plaintiff  has"
"proved at least paper title to the land mentioned in the schedule of the plaint,"
"or whether the corpus has been identified."
