"Although,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  substituted  defendants"
"submitted  that  the  question  of  prescription  has  been  taken  up  for  the  first"
"time  only  before  the  Supreme  Court  and  it  cannot  be  taken  up  in  such  a"
"manner, I do not agree. I am of the view that this is a question of law that"
"needs determination as it has been allowed by this Court when formulating"
"the questions of law under which this appeal would be considered."
"For the reasons as  considered above, I  am of the view that  the defendants’"
"claim  of  Laesio  Enormis  before  the  District  Court  was  clearly  prescribed  in"
"terms of law. However, I am in agreement with the learned President’s Counsel"
"that  the  question  of  prescription  is  not  a  matter  where  patent  want  of"
"jurisdiction can be asserted, but a latent want of jurisdiction, which can be"
"waived by the conduct of the parties."
"Although the matter under appeal is not an action initiated by the defendants"
"on  the  basis  of  Laesio  Enormis,  when  this  position  was  taken  up  by  the"
"defendants,  the  plaintiff  has  thought  it  fit  not  to  raise  an  issue  based  on"
"prescription at the trial, though if raised, the claim of Laesio Enormis would"
"clearly  be  prescribed  under  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case.  Since"
"this was a matter that has not been raised or required to be considered before"
"the trial Court or before the Court of Appeal for that matter, I am of the view"
"that the question of prescription is a matter that has been waived off by the"
"conduct  of  the  plaintiff,  and  a  matter  that  cannot  be  taken  up  for  the  first"
"time at the hearing of this appeal, although a question of law has been raised"
"before this Court in that regard."
"However,  it  is  my  considered  view  that  when  considering  the  principle  of"
"Laesio Enormis, the delay and the conduct of the party who claims benefits"
"under  the  principle  of  Laesio  Enormis  is  very  much  a  relevant  factor.  The"
"defendants who claimed the benefit of Laesio Enormis have not initiated any"
"legal proceedings on such a basis until they were required to file an answer"
"to the plaint preferred by the plaintiff, which was a claim made more than 6"
"years after the execution of the deed marked P-03. Under such circumstances,"
"I  am  of  the  view  that  the  defendants  were  not  entitled  to  take  up  such  a"
