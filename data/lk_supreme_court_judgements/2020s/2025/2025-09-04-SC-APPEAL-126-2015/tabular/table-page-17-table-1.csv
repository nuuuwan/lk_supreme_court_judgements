"Laesio Enormis is a well-recognised principle in the Roman-Dutch law to"
"remedy injustice caused to a seller of a thing due to his ignorance or lack"
"of knowledge."
"This principle will not apply to a situation where the seller was aware of"
"the  true  value  of  the  property  at  the  time  of  the  execution  of  the  deed,"
"however the property was sold at a lesser price."
"The  remedy  available  to  an  aggrieved  party  under  this  principle  is  not"
"confined  to  cancellation  of  the  contract  but  also  damages.  In  such  a"
"situation the contract is not void but is voidable. Therefore, a transferor"
"who institutes an action on the principle of Laesio Enormis has to do so"
"without delay. The principle of Laesio Enormis is available as against a"
"transferee  of  a  deed  and  not  against  a  third  party  who  had  become"
"entitled to the property on a deed granted by the transferee.‚Äù"
