"After summarizing what the plaintiff and the defendants have stated in their"
"respective plaint and answer, and narrating the admissions and the issues,"
"the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  of  Gampaha  has  proceeded  straight"
"away  to  consider  the  stand  taken  up  by  the  defendants  to  claim  that  the"
"transaction  was  not  in  fact  a  transfer  of  a  land,  but  a  security  for  a  loan"
"obtained,  and  the  relevant  claim  of  Laesio  Enormis,  before  proceeding  to"
"dismiss the action of the plaintiff and grant relief as sought by the defendants."
"I am also  unable to find that the  Court  of Appeal  has considered this legal"
"aspect  in  the  Court of  Appeal  judgment where  the  judgment  of  the  District"
"Court was affirmed. I find that His Lordship of the Court of Appeal has only"
"considered the judgment of the District Court in order to justify granting of"
"relief to the defendants by the learned Additional District Judge."
"Under these circumstances, I find it relevant to consider the 6th question of"
"law under which Leave to Appeal was granted by this Court before considering"
"the  other  questions  of  law.  The  6th  question  of  law  relates  to  whether  the"
"learned District Judge, as well as the Court of Appeal, was correct in the way"
"the  validity  of  the  deed  of  transfer  that  was  challenged  before  the  District"
"Court was determined."
"There cannot be any dispute that the said deed No. 1449 marked P-03 at the"
"trial  was  an  outright  deed  of  transfer  by  the  2nd  defendant  of  the  action,"
"namely Hewapathiranahelage Emalin, to Francis Paul Kingsley Dias for a sum"
"of Rs. 18,000/-. In the notarial certificate, the Notary has clearly stated that"
"the said sum was transacted before him."
"I am of the view that this is a situation where the provisions of section 92 of"
"the Evidence Ordinance are clearly applicable."
"Section  92  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance,  which  has  6  provisos  attached  to  it"
"reads as follows."
