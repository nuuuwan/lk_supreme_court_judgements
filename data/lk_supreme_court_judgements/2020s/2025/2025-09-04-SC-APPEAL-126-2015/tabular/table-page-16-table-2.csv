"Vs. Heen Menike (2004) 3 SLR 289, where it was held,"
"1.  The principle of Roman-Dutch law is to remedy injustice caused to a"
"seller of a thing due to his ignorance or lack of knowledge. This principle"
"could not apply to a situation where  the seller was aware of the true"
"value of the property at the time of execution of the deed."
"2.  A transferor who institutes an action on the principle of Laesio Enormis"
"has to do so without delay. The principle of Laesio Enormis is available"
"as against a transferee of a deed and not against a 3rd party who had"
"become entitled to the property on a deed granted by the transferee."
