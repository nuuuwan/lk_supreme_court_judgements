"transfer in trust for the appellant, and the doctrine of laesio enormis has"
"no application in such a case.‚Äù"
"The above line of authority clearly establishes that to claim Laesio Enormis,"
"the person who sells the land to another must have the intention to sell the"
"land, but due to the facts and the circumstances, the seller could not have"
"known the true value of the land. It has to be established that as a result, he"
"sold it for less than half of its actual value."
"However,  in  the  matter  under  the  appeal,  the  position  taken  up  by  the"
"defendants before the trial Court had been that the 2nd defendant never had"
"the intention of selling the land to Kingsley Dias, but she only entered into"
"the transaction to secure a loan obtained by her from the said Dias."
"It is my considered view that under such circumstances, there cannot be a"
"basis for the defendants to claim the benefit of the principle of Laesio Enormis."
"As pleaded by they themselves, the intention of the 2nd defendant was not to"
"sell  the  land.  The  evidence  led  on  behalf  of  the  defendants  at  the  trial  had"
"been to the effect that they very well knew the value of the land when the 2nd"
"defendant executed the deed marked P-03 in favour of Kingsley Dias."
"It is my view that under the said circumstances, the defendants cannot have"
"had the benefit of the principle of Laesio Enormis as determined by the learned"
"Additional District Judge as well as His Lordship of the Court of Appeal."
"As  the  evidence  clearly  demonstrates,  the  plaintiff  was  not  the  party  who"
"purchased the land from the 2nd defendant who claimed the benefit of Laesio"
"Enormis before the District Court. She is a  bona fide  purchaser of the land"
"from the heirs of Kinglsey Dias for a valuable consideration that fits the value"
