"In her plaint, the plaintiff has averred her cause of action on the basis that"
"the  defendants  who  are  in  possession  of  Lot  2  of  the  same  plan  caused"
"obstructions  to  the  common  Southern  boundary  between  Lot  1  and  Lot  2."

"The defendants filing their answer on 24-05-1989 has admitted the execution"
