"the defendants, there can be no certainty in such transactions. At no point in"
"the answer of the defendants or by way of issues, the defendants have claimed"
"a constructive trust."
"The evidence clearly shows that after the execution of the deed of transfer, the"
"possession of the land had been handed over to the purchaser of the property,"
"and  it  was  on  that  basis  the  heirs  of  Kingsley  Dias  had  transferred  their"
"inherited rights of the property to the plaintiff by the deed marked P-02. There"
"was  no  evidence  before  the  Court  to  suggest  that  the  vendor  allowed  the"
"vendee to enjoy the property in lieu of interest of the loan as claimed by the"
"defendants."
"If  it  was  the  contention  of  the  defendants  that  the  transaction  was  not  an"
"outright  sale,  they  should  have  filed  an  action  before  a  competent  Court"
"claiming rights on the basis of a constructive trust for a declaration claiming"
"reliefs on that basis. The defendants have clearly slept over their rights until"
"the plaintiff decided to file an action to obtain a declaration of title to the land,"
"and had thought it fit to claim that the transaction upon which the plaintiff’s"
"predecessors in title obtained their rights was not an actual transfer."
"Under these circumstances, it is my considered view that there was no basis"
"to  consider  the  defendants’  counter  claim  that  the  transaction  was  not  an"
"outright  transfer  in  terms  of  the  provisos  of  section  92  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance. Hence, I hold that both the Courts have erred in law when it was"
"determined  that  the  deed  marked  P-03  was  not  an  actual  deed  of  transfer,"
"whereas it was."
"Having  said  that,  I  will  now  proceed  to  consider  the  other  questions  of  law"
"which  revolves  around  whether  there  is  any  justification  of  the  decision  to"
"annul the deed of transfer marked P-03, under which the plaintiff had claimed"
"title."
"The prescriptive period for one to claim benefit under the principle of Laesio"
"Enormis  is  not  a  matter  expressly  provided  for  under  the  provisions  of  the"
"Prescription  Ordinance.  As  correctly  pointed  out  by  the  learned  President’s"
