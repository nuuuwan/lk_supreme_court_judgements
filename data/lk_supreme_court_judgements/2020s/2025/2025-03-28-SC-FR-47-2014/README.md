SC FRA 47/2014 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 17

2. On or about 8th December 1998, the Inspector General of Police introduced a special

absorption scheme allowing eligible officers in the Reserve Force to transition into the

Regular Force. However, the scheme did not provide for direct absorption into the same

rank that the officers had held in the Reserve Force. Instead, officers were required to

accept a placement at a lower rank upon joining the Regular Force.

3. In response to the call for applications, the Petitioners, who were Inspectors of Police in

the Reserve Force at the time, voluntarily applied to be absorbed into the Regular Force.

In accordance with the terms of the scheme, they were appointed as Sub-Inspectors in

the Regular Force with effect from 13th June 1999, which was one rank lower than their

previous position. At the time of their absorption, the Petitioners did not challenge their

placement and continued their service in the Regular Force.

4. On 30th January 2006, the Secretary to the Ministry overseeing the Police Department

issued a directive instructing the Inspector General of Police to proceed with promotions

to the rank of Inspector of Police. The eligibility criteria for this Petition required officers

to have completed eight years of satisfactory service in the rank of Sub-Inspector of Police.

Since the Petitioners had been absorbed into the Regular Force only in 1999, they had

less than eight years of service in that rank by 2006 and were, therefore, not eligible for

promotion under this scheme.

5. On the same date, i.e. 30th January 2006, the Cabinet of Ministers approved a new policy

decision regarding the absorption of officers from the Reserve Force into the Regular

Force. Unlike the 1998 scheme, this new policy permitted Reserve Force officers to be

absorbed at the same rank they held at the time of absorption, provided they met the

requisite qualifications. Consequently, those Reserve Force officers who had remained in

the Reserve Force and had not opted for absorption under the 1998 scheme were now

able to transition into the Regular Force in 2006 while retaining their existing rank.

SC FRA 47/2014 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 17

6. This resulted in a situation where officers who had remained in the Reserve Force until

2006 were absorbed into the Regular Force at a higher rank than those who had opted

for absorption under the 1998 scheme, including the Petitioners. As of 2006, the

Petitioners were still serving as Sub-Inspectors of Police in the Regular Force and had not

yet completed the required eight years of service in that rank to qualify for promotion to

Inspector of Police under the regular promotion criteria.

7. In response to this development, several Sub-Inspectors of the Regular Force, including

the 1st and 2nd Petitioners, filed Fundamental Rights Applications bearing Nos. 120/2006

and 123/2006. They argued that officers who had been absorbed into the Regular Force

in 2006 at the rank of Inspector of Police were gaining an unfair advantage over them

despite having remained in the Reserve Force, whereas the Petitioners had already

transitioned into the Regular Force under the 1998 scheme. The Petitioners sought relief,

requesting that their prior service in the Reserve Force be considered when determining

their eligibility for promotion.

8. Following these applications, the matter was referred to the National Police Commission

for possible administrative relief. The Commission subsequently decided to promote 164

Sub-Inspectors of Police, including the Petitioners, to the rank of Inspector of Police with

effect from 1st February 2006, taking into account their service in the Regular Force.

However, the 3rd Petitioner was not included in this promotion due to an unfavourable

service report, and his promotion was waitlisted.

9. As per paragraph 5 of RTM 1002, which governed the 2006 absorption scheme, officers

absorbed into the Regular Force from the Reserve Force were placed in the seniority list

below their Regular Force counterparts from the respective years in which they had been

enlisted. Accordingly, those absorbed under the 2006 scheme as Inspectors of Police were

placed below the Petitioners, who had by then been promoted to that rank. However,

SC FRA 47/2014 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 17

these newly absorbed officers were permitted to count their past service as Inspectors of

Police in the Reserve Force when determining eligibility for future promotions within the

Regular Force.

10. Subsequently, on 18th December 2012, in Mohotti Mudiyanselage Sanath Lakshman

Bandara v. Inspector General of Police,1 the State provided an undertaking to the

Supreme Court that the recruitment scheme requiring eight years of service in the rank of

Inspector of Police for promotion to Chief Inspector of Police would be adhered to. In line

with this undertaking, applications were called for promotions under RTM No. 141, dated

4th September 2013.

11. By 25th September 2013, the Petitioners had completed only seven years and seven

months of service in the rank of Inspector of Police, falling short of the required eight-

year period necessary for promotion to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police. However, the

Petitioners contend that their one-year service as Inspectors of Police in the Reserve Force

before their absorption into the Regular Force in 1999 should also be taken into account

when calculating their eligibility period. They argue that the failure to recognise this

period has placed them at a disadvantage compared to officers who were absorbed into

the Regular Force under the 2006 scheme, whose past service in the Reserve Force was

counted toward their eligibility for promotion.

12. As a result, the Petitioners claim that the Respondents failure to consider their prior

service in the Reserve Force violates their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article

12(1) of the Constitution. They have sought a direction from this Court requiring the

Respondents to accept their applications for promotion to the rank of Chief Inspector of

Police and to promote them following an interview before a duly constituted Board.

1 SCFR Application No. 643/12, SC Minutes of 18th December 2012

SC FRA 47/2014 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 17

13. The primary issue before the Court is whether the Petitioners service in the Reserve Force

should be considered when calculating their eligibility for promotion to Chief Inspector

of Police and whether the differential treatment between them and officers absorbed in

2006 constitutes an infringement of their constitutional rights.

14. This Court finds that the Petitioners' period of service in the Reserve Force in the rank of

Inspector of Police cannot be added when considering their promotion to the rank of

Chief Inspector of Police in the Regular Force in 2013. The Petitioners, who were absorbed

into the Regular Force in 1999, cannot be equated with the Inspectors of Police of the

Reserve Force, who were absorbed into the Regular Force on the 24th February 2006 and

whose past service in the Reserve Force was given due recognition. The Petitioners had

already benefited from a similar concession when they were promoted to the rank of

Inspector of Police with effect from 1st February 2006 following the filing of SCFR

Applications Nos. 120/2006 and 123/2006, wherein their service as Sub-Inspectors of

Police in the Reserve Force was considered in granting them promotions in the Regular

Force.

15. Although the National Police Commission had approved a recommendation by the

Inspector General of Police to add past periods of service in the Reserve Force to the

service of all police officers absorbed into the Regular Force prior to 24th February 2006

(P10A, P10B, and P10C), the Petitioners past service had already been considered at the

time they were promoted to the rank of Inspector of Police with effect from 01st February

2006. The Petitioners and others who were absorbed into the Regular Force in 1999 as

Sub-Inspectors of Police under 2R1 were not entitled to have their past service in the

Reserve Force recognised again because that period had already been accounted for in

their earlier promotion. Permitting the same period of past service to be repeatedly relied

upon for subsequent promotions would allow an infinite cycle of recognition, which is

impermissible.

SC FRA 47/2014 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 17

16. In R.A.S.R. Kulathunga and others v. Pujith Jayasundera, Inspector General of Police

and others,2 the Supreme Court upheld the decision to permit Inspectors of Police of the

Reserve Force who were absorbed into the Regular Force in 2006 to rely on their past

service in the Reserve Force when seeking promotion to Chief Inspector of Police in the

Regular Force. The Petitioners in the present case did not object to this decision at that

time, nor did they object to the promotional criteria applied in 2006.

17. His Lordship Jayasuriya CJ held,

It is pertinent to observe that the said circular only specifies that a minimum of 8

years in active service in the rank of Inspector of Police and it does not make a

distinction between active service in the regular force and the active service in the

reserve force. It is my view, acceptance of the submission of the Petitioners would

amount to introducing an additional criteria which was not stipulated in the

circular.3

18. His Lordship, in the aforementioned case, found that the promotee-respondents in that

case who joined the Reserve Force between 1988 and 1995 as Sub- Inspectors, were

promoted to Inspector of Police in the Reserve Force between 1998 and 2002, and had

served between 10 to 14 years in that rank by the date specified in the circular (25th

September 2013).

19. At the time of the Petitioners promotions to Inspector of Police in the Regular Force in

2006, their past service in the Reserve Force was counted as service in the rank of Sub-

Inspector of Police, not Inspector of Police. Although they had been Inspectors of Police

in the Reserve Force in 1999, they were absorbed into the Regular Force voluntarily at a

2 SCFR Application No. 132/2014, SC minutes of 18th March 2021

3 ibid at p. 24

SC FRA 47/2014 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 17

lower rank. The Petitioners did not object to this at the time, nor did they claim that their

service should be considered at the rank they last held in the Reserve Force. The relief

sought in SCFR Applications Nos. 120/2006 and 123/2006 clearly demonstrate that the

Petitioners requested their service in the Reserve Force to be added to their service in the

Regular Force as Sub-Inspectors, rather than at the higher rank they previously held.

Therefore, their past service as Inspectors of Police in the Reserve Force is irrelevant to

subsequent promotions in the Regular Force, as it was already accounted for when they

were promoted to Inspector of Police in the Regular Force in 2006.

20. The Petitioners application must also fail as they have not named as Respondents the

police officers who were promoted to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police in 2013. The

substantive relief sought in prayer (e) of the Petitioners application is to direct the

Respondents to consider their service in the Reserve Force and grant them promotions to

the rank of Chief Inspector of Police. However, while state functionaries such as the

Inspector General of Police and other relevant officials have been named as Respondents,

the police officers who were successfully promoted in 2013, including those who were

absorbed into the Regular Force in 2006 and subsequently promoted, have not been

made parties to the proceedings.

21. The failure of the Petitioners to name these officers as Respondents is a significant

procedural flaw, as any relief granted in favour of the Petitioners would necessarily affect

the rights, status, and seniority of those already promoted. Granting such relief would not

only disrupt the existing hierarchy within the police force but would also call into question

the legitimacy of prior promotions, potentially leading to administrative uncertainty and

further litigation. This is particularly relevant given that the seniority of these promoted

officers has already been established and reflected in the document marked as 2R7.

SC FRA 47/2014 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 17

22. In P.S.R. Premalal and others v. Wasala Mudiyanselage Nimal Jayantha

Pushpakumara, Commissioner of Examinations,4 His Lordship Dehideniya J.

underscored the necessity for petitioners to name all necessary parties in an application

when the rights and interests of such parties are at stake.

23. This principle was further reinforced in Don Shelton Hettiarachchi v. Sri Lanka Ports

Authority and others,5 where the Court categorically stated that a failure to include

parties whose rights might be adversely affected is a fatal defect that can render an

application unsustainable in law. The reasoning behind this requirement is to ensure that

no party is subjected to an adverse judicial determination without having been afforded

an opportunity to be heard. By failing to include the officers who were promoted in 2013,

the Petitioners have failed to adhere to this fundamental procedural requirement, thereby

rendering their application untenable.

24. The Petitioners, who were absorbed into the Regular Force in 1999, belong to a separate

and distinct category from those who were absorbed in 2006. The absorption of the

Petitioners into the Regular Force was governed by the special absorption scheme

introduced by the Inspector General of Police on the 08th December 1998 (2R1), which

laid out specific conditions for their transition from the Reserve Force. Under this scheme,

the Petitioners were integrated into the Regular Force at a lower rank and were required

to progress in their careers in accordance with the promotion criteria applicable to

Regular Force officers. In contrast, those absorbed in 2006 were subject to a different set

of conditions, which, among other things, recognised their prior service in the Reserve

Force for promotional purposes.

4 SCFR Application No. 502/2010, SC Minutes of 05th March 2019

5 [2007] 2 Sri L.R. 307

SC FRA 47/2014 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 17

25. This fundamental distinction between the two groups underscores why the Petitioners

cannot claim the same treatment as those absorbed in 2006. Once the Petitioners entered

the Regular Force in 1999, they ceased to be Reservists and were placed on a trajectory

identical to other officers in the Regular Force. They could no longer rely on their past

service in the Reserve Force to claim an advantage in the promotion process, as their

career progression was now subject to the same rules applicable to all Regular Force

officers.

26. Her Ladyship Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake J., in Tuan Ishan Raban and others v. Members

of the Police Commission and others,6 affirmed that the Regular Force and the Reserve

Force are inherently distinct categories, and there exists no rational or legal basis for

linking them for promotional purposes. The judgment in this case reinforces the principle

that once an officer is absorbed into the Regular Force, their prior service in the Reserve

Force cannot be revisited or utilised to gain preferential treatment in promotions.

27. his principle was similarly articulated in Ramupillai v. Festus Perera, Minister of Public

Administration, Provincial Councils & Home Affairs,7 where Ranasinghe CJ held that

once individuals are recruited into a common class or service, any pre-existing distinctions

based on prior service or past classification disappear. Thereafter, all individuals within

that class must be treated uniformly for the purpose of promotions, transfers, and other

service-related benefits. This reasoning was echoed by His Lordship Sripavan J. (as he then

was) in Dharmakeerthi Ranathungage and others v. Commissioner General of Labour

and others,8 where the Court held that once individuals are integrated into a service, their

previous classifications become irrelevant for promotional considerations. These judicial

6 [2007] 2 Sri L.R. 351

7 [1991] 1 Sri L.R. 11 at p. 26

8 SCFR Application No. 620/2010, SC Minutes of 07th March 2013

SC FRA 47/2014 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 17

pronouncements firmly establish that the Petitioners, having been absorbed into the

Regular Force in 1999, cannot now resurrect their prior status as Reservists to claim an

entitlement to promotions under different conditions.

28. Having considered the totality of the aforementioned circumstances and legal authorities,

I find that the Petitioners have failed to establish a violation of their fundamental rights

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution by one or more of the Respondents. Therefore, this

application is dismissed.

Application Dismissed.
