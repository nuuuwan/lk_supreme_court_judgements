"Regular  Force  as  Sub-Inspectors,  rather  than  at  the  higher  rank  they  previously  held."
"Therefore, their past service as Inspectors of Police in the Reserve Force is irrelevant to"
"subsequent promotions in the Regular Force, as it was already accounted for when they"
"were promoted to Inspector of Police in the Regular Force in 2006."
