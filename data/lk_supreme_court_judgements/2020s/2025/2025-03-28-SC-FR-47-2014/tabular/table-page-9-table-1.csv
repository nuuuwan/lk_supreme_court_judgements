"2.  On  or  about  8th  December  1998,  the  Inspector  General  of  Police  introduced  a  special",""
"","absorption  scheme  allowing  eligible  officers  in  the  Reserve  Force  to  transition  into  the"
"","Regular Force. However, the scheme did not provide for direct absorption into the same"
"","rank  that  the  officers  had  held  in  the  Reserve  Force.  Instead,  officers  were  required  to"
"","accept a placement at a lower rank upon joining the Regular Force."
"3.","In response to the call for applications, the Petitioners, who were Inspectors of Police in"
"","the Reserve Force at the time, voluntarily applied to be absorbed into the Regular Force."
"","In accordance with the terms of the scheme, they were appointed as Sub-Inspectors in"
"","the Regular Force with effect from 13th June 1999, which was one rank lower than their"
"","previous position. At the time of their absorption, the Petitioners did not challenge their"
"","placement and continued their service in the Regular Force."
