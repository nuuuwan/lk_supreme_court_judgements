"6.  This resulted in a situation where officers who had remained in the Reserve Force until",""
"","2006 were absorbed into the Regular Force at a higher rank than those who had opted"
"","for  absorption  under  the  1998  scheme, 
including  the  Petitioners.  As  of  2006,  the"
"","Petitioners were still serving as Sub-Inspectors of Police in the Regular Force and had not"
"","yet completed the required eight years of service in that rank to qualify for promotion to"
"","Inspector of Police under the regular promotion criteria."
"7.","In response to this development, several Sub-Inspectors of the Regular Force, including"
"","the 1st and 2nd Petitioners, filed Fundamental Rights Applications bearing Nos. 120/2006"
"","and 123/2006. They argued that officers who had been absorbed into the Regular Force"
"","in 2006 at the rank of Inspector of Police were gaining an unfair  advantage over them"
"","despite  having  remained  in  the  Reserve  Force,  whereas  the  Petitioners  had  already"
"","transitioned into the Regular Force under the 1998 scheme. The Petitioners sought relief,"
"","requesting that their prior service in the Reserve Force be considered when determining"
"","their eligibility for promotion."
