Argued on: 07/08/2025

Decided on: 26/09/2025

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

[1] By Plaint dated 20/02/2002, the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the “Plaintiff-Respondent”) instituted Action No.

19530/L in the District Court of Colombo (hereinafter referred to as the “first

action”) against the Defendants-Respondents-Appellants (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the “Defendants-Appellants”), seeking, inter alia, a

declaration of title to the land in dispute, the ejectment of the Defendants-

Appellants from the said land, and the recovery of damages.

[2] The first action, bearing No. 19530/L, was dismissed by the District Court on

23/05/2003 for non-compliance with an imperative provision of the Civil

Page 6 of 18

Procedure Code. Thereafter, the Plaintiff-Respondent filed an Appeal, bearing

No. 412/2003(F), in the Court of Appeal, seeking to have the said dismissal set

aside.

[3] While Appeal No. 412/2003(F) was pending before the Court of Appeal, the

Plaintiff-Respondent instituted another action, bearing No. 19999/L

(hereinafter referred to as the “second action”), in the District Court of Colombo

against the same Defendants, based on the same cause of action relating to the

same land, notwithstanding the pendency of the Appeal in Action No.

412/2003(F) before the Court of Appeal.

[4] In their Answer, the Defendants raised a preliminary objection to the

maintainability of the second action, contending, inter alia, that the pendency

of the Appeal in the first action rendered the second action misconceived in law.

The Defendant-Appellants accordingly sought a ruling on the maintainability

of the Action No. 19999/L. Upon consideration of Issue No. 19, raised on the

preliminary objection, the learned District Judge upheld the objection and

dismissed the second action before the conclusion of the Defendant’s case.

[5] In the Order dated 26/03/2007, the learned District Judge observed that the

Plaintiff-Respondent, by motion dated 19/10/2006, had brought to the

attention of Court that an application had been filed in the Court of Appeal

seeking leave to withdraw Appeal No. 412/2003(F), being the Appeal in Action

No. 19530/L. However, the Court observed that the Plaintiff-Respondent had

failed to establish that the said application for withdrawal had been allowed by

the Court of Appeal or that the Appeal had been withdrawn.

[6] Accordingly, the District Court on 26/03/2007 held that the Plaintiff-

Respondent was not entitled to institute and maintain the second action, as the

Appeal against the dismissal of the first action remained pending before the

Court of Appeal as of the relevant date.

Page 7 of 18

[7] Being aggrieved by the said Order dated 26/03/2007, the Plaintiff-Respondent

by Petition of Appeal bearing No. WP HCCA/COL/138/2007(F) dated

18/05/2007 appealed to the Civil Appeal High Court holden in Colombo (“the

Appellate Court”).

[8] Before the Appellate Court, the Plaintiff-Respondent contended that the

dismissal order amounted to a final judgment within the meaning of Section

147 of the Civil Procedure Code, since it determined a pure question of law,

namely res judicata, which, once upheld, brought the proceedings to an end. It

was argued that because the Order disposed of the entire action, it was final in

nature and could therefore be appealed as of right.

[9] The Plaintiff-Respondent sought to distinguish Ranjit vs. Kusumawathie1

from Siriwardena vs. Air Ceylon Ltd2, on the basis that in the former, the

Order arose from an application made in the course of proceedings, whereas in

the present case, the dismissal was based on a preliminary issue framed at the

outset. Reliance was placed on Siriwardena vs. Air Ceylon Ltd3, where an

Order was held to be final if it disposed of the entire matter in litigation and left

nothing further for adjudication.

[10] The Defendant-Appellants, however, argued that the Order was interlocutory

and therefore required Leave to Appeal. They relied on Ranjit vs.

Kusumawathie4 and the English decision of Salaman vs. Warner5, which

apply the “application approach,” whereby an Order is interlocutory if,

depending on how the application is decided, the case could either proceed to

trial or be brought to an end. It was submitted that had the preliminary

objection been decided in favour of the Plaintiff, the action would have

1 [1998] 1 SLR 73 2 [1984] 2 SLR 293 3 ibid 4 n (1) 5 [1891] 1 QB 734

Page 8 of 18

continued, thereby demonstrating that the Order was interlocutory. They

further contended that the application approach, affirmed by a five-judge bench

of the Supreme Court in 2010, is now the prevailing law, superseding the Order

approach adopted in Siriwardena vs. Air Ceylon Ltd6.

[11] Based on the afore stated position, the Defendants-Appellants raised a

preliminary objection, stating that the Order dated 26/03/2007 is not a final

Judgement but an Order made in the course of the action and therefore, the

application before the Appellate Court should have been that of seeking Leave

to Appeal in terms of Section 754(2) instead of a direct Appeal in terms of

Section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

[12] The question for determination is whether the Order made by the learned

District Judge of Colombo on 26 March 2007, dismissing the Plaintiff’s second

action on the ground of res judicata, constitutes a “final order” appealable as of

right under Sections 147 and 207 of the Civil Procedure Code, or whether it is

an “interlocutory order” requiring Leave to Appeal.

[13] The Appellate Court directed both parties to file written submissions on this

question. The Appellate Court, by Order dated 09/03/2009, overruled the said

preliminary objection raised by the Defendants-Appellants and fixed the matter

for argument.

[14] By Petition dated 17/04/2009, the Defendants-Appellants have invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court to set aside the Order dated 09/03/2009 of the

Appellate Court.

[15] By Order dated 15/10/2010, Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following

questions of law;

6 n (2)

Page 9 of 18

In any event was the High Court of Civil Appeal Colombo in error in ignoring

the fact that Ranjith vs. Kusumawathi being a later decision which considered

the contrary decision given in the earlier case of Siriwardana vs. Air Ceylon

Limited, which has been consistently followed by the Court of Appeal in a

number of subsequent decisions, ought to have been followed by the High

Court of Civil Appeal Colombo in the circumstances of this case?

[16] The Court also permitted the Plaintiff-Respondent to raise the following

question of law.

Whether the Divisional Bench decision of S.C. Appeal Nos. 101A/2009 and

101B/2009 (S.C. HCCALA No. 174/2008 – S.C. Minutes of 10/06/2010

would have an application in the context of an action that has been dismissed

upon a plea based on res judicata.

Respective positions taken by Counsel at the time of filing written

submissions in this Court

[17] Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent submitted that, by the Order of

the District Court upholding the plea of res judicata raised by the Defendants-

Appellants, the rights of the parties were finally determined, thereby resulting

in the dismissal of the action. Therefore, the Impugned Order of the learned

District Judge constitutes a final Judgment within the meaning of Section

754(1), read with Section 754(5), of the Civil Procedure Code, against which the

Plaintiff-Appellant could have preferred only a direct appeal.

[18] The Defendants-Appellants, on the other hand, argued that had the District

Court ruled in favor of the Plaintiff-Respondent on the said objection, the trial

would not have been finally disposed of and the matter would have proceeded

to trial. Accordingly, they contended that the Impugned Order does not amount

to a final order having the effect of a Judgment within the meaning of Sections

Page 10 of 18

754(1) and 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code, but is merely an interlocutory

order.

[19] Therefore, the question that arises for determination is whether the Order given

by the District Court is an interlocutory order where the Plaintiff-Respondent

should have filed a Leave to Appeal application under Section 754(2) instead of

filing an appeal under Section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

[20] Sections 754(1), 754(2) and 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code, reads thus;

(1) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any judgment pronounced, by

any original court in any civil action, proceeding or matter to which he is a

party may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against such judgment for

any error in fact or in law.

(2) Any person who shall be dissatisfied with any order made by any original

court in the course of any civil action, proceeding, or matter to which he is or

seeks to be a party, may prefer an appeal to the Court of Appeal against such

order for the correction of any error in fact or in law, with the leave of the

Court of Appeal first had and obtained.

(3) …

(4) …

(5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Ordinance, for the

purposes of this Chapter -

"judgment" means any judgment or order having the effect of a final judgment

made by any civil court; and

"order" means the final expression of any decision in any civil action,

proceeding or matter which is not a judgment.

Page 11 of 18

[21] At the time of submitting written arguments, both parties cited Siriwardana

vs. Air Ceylon Limited7 and Ranjith vs. Kusumawathi8, in support of their

respective cases, which extensively discussed a series of Judgments to

determine the nature of the application to be filed before the Court.

[22] The distinction between a final and an interlocutory order has received

considerable judicial attention in Sri Lanka. In Siriwardena vs. Air Ceylon

Limited9, following Bozson vs. Altrincham Urban District Council10, this

Court held that an Order is final if it leaves nothing further to be adjudicated

between the parties. In Ranjith vs. Kusumawathi11, the Court adopted the

“application approach” enunciated in Salaman vs. Warner12, which directs

attention to the nature of the application rather than solely to the effect of the

Order. According to this approach, if the determination of the application in

one way permits the case to proceed, while its determination in the other way

brings the proceedings to an end, the Order is interlocutory. This principle was

expressly affirmed by a five-judge bench in 2010.

[23] In Siriwardana vs. Air Ceylon Limited13 Sharwananda J. (as he then was),

having discussed several other decisions, applied a four-point test to determine

whether an Order had the effect of a final Judgment, and to qualify to be a

Judgment under Section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code, held;

“it must be an order finally disposing of the rights of the parties.

Page 12 of 18

The order cannot be treated to be a final order if the suit or action is still left

alive suit or action for the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of

the parties in the ordinary way

The finality of the order must be determined in relation to the suit

The mere fact that a cardinal point in the suit has been decided or even a vital

and important issue determined in the case, is not enough to make an order, a

final one.”

[24] In Ranjith vs. Kusumawathie14 Deeraratne J., having examined a line of

Judgments from the English Courts, observed that;

“…there have been two virtually alternating tests adopted by different judges

from time to time in the UK to determine what final orders and interlocutory

orders were. The order approach was adopted in Shubrook v. Tufnell (1882)

9 QBD 621, where Jessel, MR, and Lindely, LJ. held that an order is final if it

finally determines the matter in litigation. Thus, the issue of final and

interlocutory depended on the order made. The application approach was

adopted in Salaman v. Warnar and others (1891) 1 QB 734, in which the Court

of Appeal, consisting of Lord Esher, MR, Fry and Lopes, LJJ. held that the final

order is one made on such application or proceeding that, for whichever side

the order was given, it will, if it stands, finally determine the matter in

litigation. Thus, the issue of final or interlocutory depended on the nature of

the application or proceedings giving rise to the order and not the order itself.”

[25] Since there was a conflict between the decisions in Siriwardana vs. Air

Ceylon Limited15 and Ranjith vs. Kusumawathi16, in Rajendra Chettiar vs.

14 n (1) 15 n (2) 16 n (1)

Page 13 of 18

Narayanan Chettiar17, His Lordship the Chief Justice nominated a bench of

five Judges to reconsider the Judgments in these two cases. In Rajendra

Chettiar vs. Narayanan Chettiar18, the Court considered Appeal Nos.

101A/2009 and 101B/2009 (SC HCCA LA 174/2008), in which the learned

Additional District Judge had rejected the Plaints and dismissed the action in

limine, in terms of Section 46(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. In determining

the matter, the Court cited with approval the decision in Ranjith vs.

Kusumawathi19, wherein Dr. Shirani A. Bandaranayake, J. (as she then was)

observed:

“The order appealed from is an order made against the appellant at the first

hurdle. Can one say that the order made on the application of the 4th defendant

is one such that whichever way the order was given, it would have finally

determined the litigation? Far from that, even if the order was given in favor

of the appellant, he has to face the second hurdle, namely the trial to vindicate

his claim.

Her Ladyship further observed:

“Considering the decision given by Deeraratne J., in Ranjith vs. Kusumawathi

(supra) it is abundantly clear that the order dated 14.05.2008 is not a final

order having the effect of a judgment within the meaning of sub-sections

754(1) and 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code, but is only an interlocutory

order”.

[26] In 2015, the Supreme Court, having considered SC Appeal No. 41/2015 and

SC/CHC Appeal No. 37/2008, which came up for determination before a bench

17 [2011] 2 SLR 70 18 ibid 19 n (1)

Page 14 of 18

of seven Judges of this Court, granted Special Leave to Appeal on the following

questions of law:

Was the judgment in Rajendra Chettiar v. Narayanan Chettiar, relied on by

the Court of Appeal, wrongly decided?

Whether the decision enunciated in Rajendra Chettiar v. Narayanan Chettiar,

deciding that the application approach test should be preferred over the order

approach test in deciding whether an order is a final or interlocutory order in

civil proceedings be revisited in this appeal.

[27] SC Appeal No. 41/2015 was filed following a dismissal for non-compliance with

an imperative provision of the Civil Procedure Code, and SC/CHC Appeal No.

37/2008 arose from a dismissal on the ground of prescription. In both cases,

the lower courts upheld preliminary objections raised by the respective parties

and dismissed the actions. As the questions of law raised in both cases were

identical, they were taken up together, and the Supreme Court delivered a single

Judgment. In its Judgment dated 04/08/2017, the Supreme Court extensively

discussed the decisions in Siriwardana vs. Air Ceylon Limited20, Ranjith

vs. Kusumawathi21 and Rajendra Chettiar vs. Narayanan Chettiar22.

Priyasad Dep, PC, CJ, observed:

“In two cases before us orders are made in respect of points of law raised by

the parties. If the preliminary objections were rejected cases would have

proceeded to trial. In both cases at the time of dismissal, the rights of the

parties were not determined.

20 n (2) 21 n (1) 22 n (17)

Page 15 of 18

In Order to decide whether an Order is a final Judgment or not, it is my view

that the proper approach is the approach adopted by Lord Esher in Salman

vs. Warnar which was cited with approval by Lord Denning in Salter Rex vs.

Gosh. It stated:

if their decision whichever way it is given, will if it stands finally

dispose of the matter in dispute, I think that for the purpose of

these rules it is final. On the other hand, if their decision, if given

in one way, finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but if given

the other, will allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final,

but interlocutory”

[28] In both instances, upon consideration of the relevant judicial precedent, this

Court held that the Orders made by the respective Courts were interlocutory in

nature. Accordingly, the proper course available to the aggrieved parties was to

invoke the jurisdiction of this Court by way of a Leave to Appeal application

under Section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, and not by way of an Appeal

under Section 754(1). Both Appeals were therefore dismissed.

[29] In the present case, at the commencement of the trial, the Defendants raised a

preliminary objection before the District Court, challenging the maintainability

of the action. The objection was founded on the institution of Case No. 19530/L,

previously filed against the same Defendants, based on the same cause of action

and in respect of the same land. The Defendants accordingly contended that the

present action constituted a duplication of proceedings. The Plaintiffs did not

object to the preliminary objection being raised at the commencement of the

Defendants' case. Having considered the material placed before it, the District

Court, by Order dated 26/03/2007, upheld the objection and dismissed the

second action on the ground that it was not maintainable.

Page 16 of 18

[30] In Salaman vs. Warner23, Fry L.J. stated thus;

“I think that the true definition is this. I conceive that an order is ‘final’ only

where it is made upon an application or other proceeding which must,

whether such application or other proceeding fail or succeed, determine the

action. Conversely, I think that an order is ‘interlocutory’ where it cannot be

affirmed that in either event the action will be determined.”

[31] As referred to earlier in this Judgment, the first action, bearing No. 19530/L,

was dismissed by the District Court on 23/05/2003 for non-compliance with

an imperative provision of the Civil Procedure Code. The Plaintiff-Respondent

raised a question of law based on the plea of res judicata through estoppel,

referencing the Divisional Bench decision Appeal Nos. 101A/2009 and

101B/2009 [SC HCCA LA 174/2008] (Rajendra Chettiar vs. Narayanan

Chettiar24). In that case, the learned Additional District Judge dismissed the

action in limine under Section 46(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. Importantly,

in both cases, the merits were not examined at that time.

[32] In Stassen Exports Ltd. vs. Lipton Ltd. and another25, the Supreme Court

held;

“considering the views expressed on the doctrine of res judicata, it is

apparent that where a final judicial decision has been pronounced by a court

which had jurisdiction over the issue before it, any party to such litigation as

against the other party would be estopped in any subsequent litigation from

disputing such decision on the merits whether it be used as the foundation of

an action or as a bar to any claim.----”

23 n (5) 24 n (5) 25 [2009] 2 SLR 172

Page 17 of 18

In Carl Zeiss Stiftung vs. Rayner & Keeler Ltd. (No. 2)26, Lord Guest

stated, “any party to such litigation as against any other party is estopped

in any subsequent litigation from disputing or questioning such decision on

the merits.”

[33] It is crucial to recognize that when the District Court dismissed the second

action, it did not consider or resolve the rights and liabilities of the parties on

the merits, nor did it issue a final Judgment. By Order dated 26/03/2007, the

District Court inter alia, upheld the plea of res judicata by way of estoppel and

accordingly dismissed the action. At the time the District Court made its Order,

an Appeal against the Order in the first action was pending before the Court of

Appeal. The Court held that although the Plaintiff admitted to filing the Appeal

and undertook to withdraw it, the Plaintiff had failed to establish that the

application to withdraw the Appeal bearing No. C.A. 412/03 had been allowed,

or that the Appeal had in fact been withdrawn.

[34] Applying the application approach to the present case, it is evident that the

dismissal of the Plaintiff’s second action arose from a preliminary objection

taken at the commencement of proceedings. While the decision to uphold the

objection brought the action to an end, had the objection been overruled, the

matter would have proceeded to trial, leaving the parties’ substantive rights yet

to be decided. The decisive consideration is whether the Order necessarily

concludes the litigation irrespective of the outcome of the application. On this

test, the Order dated 26/03/2007 must be regarded as interlocutory.

[35] Considering all the above circumstances, it cannot be said that the decision of

the District Court, in dismissing the second action, was final and conclusive

between the parties on the merits so as to operate as a complete bar to further

proceedings. Accordingly, I hold that the Order dated 26/03/2007 is not a Final

26 1967 (1) AC. 853

Page 18 of 18

Order having the effect of a Judgment within the meaning of Sections 754(1)

and 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code, but is interlocutory in nature.

[36] Therefore, I answer the questions of law Nos. 1 in the affirmative, No. 2 in the

negative, set aside the Order dated 09/03/2009 of the Civil Appeal High Court

of Colombo, and dismiss the Appeal bearing No. WP/HCCA/COL/138/2007(F)

filed in that Court.

[37] Appeal allowed. No order as to costs.
