"[30]  In Salaman vs. Warner23, Fry L.J. stated thus;"
"“I think that the true definition is this. I conceive that an order is ‘final’ only"
"where  it  is  made  upon  an  application  or  other  proceeding  which  must,"
"whether such application or other proceeding fail or succeed, determine the"
"action. Conversely, I think that an order is ‘interlocutory’ where it cannot be"
"affirmed that in either event the action will be determined.”"
