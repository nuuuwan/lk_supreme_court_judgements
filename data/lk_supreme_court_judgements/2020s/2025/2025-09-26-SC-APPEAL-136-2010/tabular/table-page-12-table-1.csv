"The order cannot be treated to be a final order if the suit or action is still left"
"alive suit or action for the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of"
"the parties in the ordinary way"
"The finality of the order must be determined in relation to the suit"
"The mere fact that a cardinal point in the suit has been decided or even a vital"
"and important issue determined in the case, is not enough to make an order, a"
"final one.”"
