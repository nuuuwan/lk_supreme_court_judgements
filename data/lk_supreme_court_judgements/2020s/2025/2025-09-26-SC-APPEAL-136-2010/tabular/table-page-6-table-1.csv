"","Procedure Code. Thereafter, the Plaintiff-Respondent filed an Appeal, bearing"
"","No. 412/2003(F), in the Court of Appeal, seeking to have the said dismissal set"
"","aside."
"[3]  While  Appeal  No.  412/2003(F)  was  pending  before  the  Court  of  Appeal,  the",""
"","Plaintiff-Respondent 
instituted 
another 
action, 
bearing  No. 
19999/L"
"","(hereinafter referred to as the “second action”), in the District Court of Colombo"
"","against the same Defendants, based on the same cause of action relating to the"
"","same 
land,  notwithstanding 
the  pendency  of 
the  Appeal 
in  Action  No."
"","412/2003(F) before the Court of Appeal."
"[4]","In 
their  Answer, 
the  Defendants 
raised  a  preliminary  objection 
to 
the"
"","maintainability of the second action, contending, inter alia, that the pendency"
"","of the Appeal in the first action rendered the second action misconceived in law."
"","The Defendant-Appellants accordingly sought a ruling on the maintainability"
"","of the Action No. 19999/L. Upon consideration of Issue No. 19, raised on the"
"","preliminary  objection,  the  learned  District  Judge  upheld  the  objection  and"
"","dismissed the second action before the conclusion of the Defendant’s case."
"[5]","In the Order dated 26/03/2007, the learned District Judge observed that the"
"","Plaintiff-Respondent,  by  motion  dated  19/10/2006,  had  brought 
to 
the"
"","attention  of  Court  that  an  application  had  been  filed  in  the  Court  of  Appeal"
"","seeking leave to withdraw Appeal No. 412/2003(F), being the Appeal in Action"
"","No. 19530/L. However, the Court observed that the Plaintiff-Respondent had"
"","failed to establish that the said application for withdrawal had been allowed by"
"","the Court of Appeal or that the Appeal had been withdrawn."
"[6]  Accordingly,","the  District  Court  on  26/03/2007  held 
that 
the  Plaintiff-"
"","Respondent was not entitled to institute and maintain the second action, as the"
"","Appeal  against  the  dismissal  of  the  first  action  remained  pending  before  the"
"","Court of Appeal as of the relevant date."
