"[33]  It  is  crucial  to  recognize  that  when  the  District  Court  dismissed  the  second"
"action, it did not consider or resolve the rights and liabilities of the parties on"
"the merits, nor did it issue a final Judgment. By Order dated 26/03/2007, the"
"District Court inter alia, upheld the plea of res judicata by way of estoppel and"
"accordingly dismissed the action. At the time the District Court made its Order,"
"an Appeal against the Order in the first action was pending before the Court of"
"Appeal. The Court held that although the Plaintiff admitted to filing the Appeal"
"and  undertook  to  withdraw  it,  the  Plaintiff  had  failed  to  establish  that  the"
"application to withdraw the Appeal bearing No. C.A. 412/03 had been allowed,"
"or that the Appeal had in fact been withdrawn."
