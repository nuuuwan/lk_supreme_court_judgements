"There are several sections in the Partition Law that compel the plaintiff to","",""

"lease,  usufruct,  servitude,  trust,","life","interest,  or  otherwise,  or  to  any"

"that the duty of the plaintiff is not limited to including those who are in fact","",""
"entitled to rights, but extends also to those who claim to be entitled or who","",""
