Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action 47 years ago, by plaint dated 08.05.1978,

in the District Court of Galle to partition the land known as

Bimpaluwewatta situated in Hikkaduwa, in extent of 2 acres and 2 roods,

among the plaintiff (2/3 share) and the 1st-8th defendants (jointly 1/3

share).

Following the institution of the action, a large number of parties intervened

as defendants so much so, even before the case was fixed for trial, the

number of defendants had increased to 88.

Preliminary Plan No. 1048 was prepared in 1979. That plan revealed that

the actual extent of the land was 3 roods and 36.5 perches, and not 2 acres

and 2 roods as pleaded. The plan also shows that the land in question is a

valuable property bounding the Colombo-Galle main road in Hikkaduwa,

consisting of a large number of business/residential premises.

Upon a commission issued by the District Court, Plan No. 1062 was

prepared in 1997, that is, 18 years after the preparation of the Preliminary

Plan, in order to superimpose certain plans on the Preliminary Plan.

According to the surveyor’s report, the plaintiff did not participate in that

survey. At the second survey, further 21 new claimants lodged claims to the

surveyor.

The foregoing facts alone are sufficient to demonstrate that the plaintiff filed

this partition action without taking the statutory procedure seriously,

thereby placing in difficulty numerous persons in possession of these

business/residential premises. This type of conduct on the part of the

plaintiff must not be encouraged, for it amounts to an abuse of the Partition

Law.

SC/APPEAL/174/2015

There are several sections in the Partition Law that compel the plaintiff to

bring all the parties who have some claim to the land. For instance, section

5 of the Partition Law enacts that the plaintiff in a partition action shall

include in his plaint as parties to the action all persons who, whether in

actual possession or not, to his knowledge are entitled or claim to be entitled

to any right, share or interest to, of, or in the land to which the action

relates, whether vested or contingent, and whether by way of mortgage,

lease, usufruct, servitude, trust, life interest, or otherwise, or to any

improvements made or effected on or to the land. It is significant to note

that the duty of the plaintiff is not limited to including those who are in fact

entitled to rights, but extends also to those who claim to be entitled or who

have effected improvements. The plaintiff in the present case manifestly

disregarded this statutory obligation.

Since the second survey in 1997, 28 years have lapsed. The status quo must

inevitably have changed since the institution of the action in 1978.

The appellant before this Court is the 59th defendant, who was added as a

party on 08.09.1994, as per Journal Entry No. 102 in the District Court

case record. According to that Journal Entry, the 59th defendant was added

on the basis that he had acquired the rights of the plaintiff during the

pendency of the case. However, neither a copy of the alleged deed nor

particulars thereof were produced to ascertain the nature of that

transaction. This kind of voluntary alienations are contrary to section 66 of

the Partition Law, and in my view the 59th defendant ought not to have been

added as a party. The 59th defendant filed no statement of claim.

By Journal Entry No. 111 dated 25.05.1995, the 59th defendant was

substituted as plaintiff on the basis that the original plaintiff had sold his

rights in the land to him. Even at that stage, a copy of the alleged deed was

not produced for the court to understand the nature of his claim and to

decide the legality of the claim.

SC/APPEAL/174/2015

The trial was postponed on four occasions. On the 5th date of trial, namely

31.10.2001, the case was dismissed by the District Judge for want of

appearance of any party.

Thereafter, the 59th defendant–substituted plaintiff applied to purge the

default on the ground that he had been ill on the date in question. At the

inquiry into that application, however, he failed to adduce sufficient

evidence, and accordingly the District Court, by order dated 28.04.2004,

refused the application.

Being dissatisfied with that order, the 59th defendant–substituted plaintiff

preferred a final appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal. By judgment dated

18.02.2014, the High Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the refusal

to purge default by the District Court was correct and the 59th defendant-

substituted plaintiff, if he so wished, could file a fresh action.

The 59th defendant-substituted plaintiff thereafter appealed to this Court.

Leave to appeal was granted on the following questions of law:

(a) Are the judgments of the District Court and High Court valid in law

or made according to law?

(b) Could the trial court dismiss the plaint in the absence of the plaintiff

without first having notified the other parties concerned and

endeavoured to compel them to bring the action to an end?

(c) As the stage of litis contestatio has been reached in this case, could

the court reject the said application on the grounds stated in the

order?

On the unique facts and circumstances of this case, I answer the above

questions against the 59th defendant–substituted plaintiff. As noted earlier,

his very locus standi to prosecute this action is in doubt. Forty-seven years

have elapsed since the filing of this action. Even in the District Court, points

of contest were never raised. A large number of parties intervened from time

to time. The original plaintiff did not institute this action with seriousness,

and failed to implead all necessary parties.

Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal without costs.
