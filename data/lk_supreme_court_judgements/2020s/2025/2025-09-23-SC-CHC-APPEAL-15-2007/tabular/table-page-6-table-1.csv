"ground  on  which  the  Appellant  sought  to  repudiate  the  contract  was  that  the  vehicle"
"which the 2nd Respondent wanted from the Respondent was a Toyota Hiace van but the"
"vehicle which was provided by the Respondent was a totally different vehicle."
"Moreover, the rights and liabilities of the Appellant, Respondent and Kuwick International"
"on the question of agency, is governed by English law. Where the principal is undisclosed"
"at the time of contracting, the contract is made with the agent, and he is personally liable"
"and entitled on it [Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency, 17th Ed., Sweet &Maxwell (2001),"
"467].  It  is  an  established  principle  in  English  law  that  an  agent  can  sue  on  a  contract"
"entered into on behalf of an undisclosed principal and even recover the principalâ€™s loss by"
"way of damages [supra. 343]."
"Hence, even if the contention of the Appellant is examined, the Respondent is entitled to"
"maintain  this  action.  However,  it  must  be  noted  that  the  learned  trial  judge  entered"
"judgment only for the purchase price agreed to by the Appellant and not the damages"
"claimed by the Respondent."
"Failure to Lead Evidence"
"Although the Respondent led evidence and marked several documents in support of his"
"case, the Appellant did not lead any evidence at the trial."
"In  Edrick  De  Silva  v.  Chandradasa  De  Silva  (70  NLR  169)  it  was  held  that  where  the"
"petitioner has led evidence sufficient in law to prove his status, i.e., a factum probandum,"
"the failure of the respondent to adduce evidence which contradicts it adds a new factor"
"in favour of the petitioner. There is then an additional ""matter before the Court"", which"
"the  definition  in  section  3  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  requires  the  Court  to  take  into"
"account, namely, that the evidence led by the petitioner is uncontradicted."
"The  Appellant  failed  to  lead  any  evidence  in  rebuttal  of  the  case  presented  by  the"
"Respondent.  No  doubt,  the  Respondent  was  cross-examined  and  evidence  so  elicited"
