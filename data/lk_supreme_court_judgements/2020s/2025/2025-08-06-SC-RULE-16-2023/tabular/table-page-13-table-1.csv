"[SC Rule No. 16/2023] Page 13 of 13"
"It must be borne in mind that this Court admits and enrolls as Attorneys-at-Law in terms of"
"Section 40 of the Judicature Act, only persons of good repute and of competent knowledge"
"and ability. Such Attorneys-at-Law once enrolled cannot engage in any deceit, malpractice,"
"crime or offence. It is a reasonable expectation of both the public and those involved in the"
"administration  of  justice  in  the  country.  If  an  Attorney-at-Law  is  unable  to  maintain  the"
"expected standard, then such an Attorney-at-Law cannot be permitted to continue to function"
"in  that  capacity  any  more.  Section  42  has  entrusted  this  Court  with  the  responsibility  of"
"maintaining the aforesaid standards. Thus, this Court has a duty to take into consideration,"
"the interests and aspirations of the general public that only persons of good repute and of"
"competent knowledge and ability function as Attorneys-at-Law. It also has a duty to maintain"
"the quality of the administration of justice, and the need to maintain the standards expected"
"from the members of the legal fraternity when deciding the course of action it should take in"
"a case of this nature."
"In the above circumstances, I do not think it is necessary for me to give further reasons to"
"show how the actions of the Respondent Attorney-at-Law has tarnished the image of the legal"
"profession of this country as a whole."
"Having  considered  all  those  circumstances,  as  the  Respondent  Attorney-at-Law  has  been"
"found guilty of an act of deceit which is also a malpractice, acting in terms of Section 42 of"
"the Judicature Act, I direct that the Respondent Attorney-at-Law Wickramage Don Dharmasiri"
"Karunaratne be removed from office as an Attorney-at-Law forthwith."
"The  Registrar  of  this  Court  is  directed  to  take  all  necessary  steps  to  implement  this  order"
"removing the Respondent Attorney-at-Law from office as an Attorney-at-Law forthwith."
