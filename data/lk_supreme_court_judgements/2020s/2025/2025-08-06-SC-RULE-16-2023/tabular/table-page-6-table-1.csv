"Although the learned Counsel for the Respondent Attorney-at-Law has cross-examined this"
"witness  (Sumedha  Priyadarshana  Perera),  the  material  elicited  from  the  cross-examination"
"has only enabled the witness Sumedha Priyadarshana Perera to repeatedly reiterate the facts"
"of this incident, i.e., the incident of the Respondent Attorney-at-Law tearing some pages from"
"the case bearing No. COC/11/2022 which he had obtained from the record room officials for"
"his inspection and study."
"After the  conclusion  of  the  evidence  of  the  witness  Sumedha  Priyadarshana  Perera,  it  was"

"It was the Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal, Maheshi Anurika Premarathna Welagedara,"
