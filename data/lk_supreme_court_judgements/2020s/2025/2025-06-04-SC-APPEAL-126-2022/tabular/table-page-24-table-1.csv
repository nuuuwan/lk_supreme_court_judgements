"Tribunal is not to dispense relief based on sympathy but to act justly"
"and equitably toward both parties."
"In  conclusion, 
the  Applicant’s  actions  constitute  not  merely  a"
"serious breach of trust and negligence, but proven misappropriation"
"of 
the  Respondent’s 
funds.  The  evidence  establishes 
that 
the"
"Applicant  retained  a  sum  of  Rs.  456,972.57/=  collected 
from"
"customers and failed to deposit it into the company’s account. His"
"unsubstantiated claim that the funds were used to settle other debts"
"does not absolve him of liability, particularly in the absence of any"
"documentation  or  approval  to  support  such  use.  This  conduct"
"reflects a deliberate act of misappropriation and a grave breach of"
"financial 
responsibility  and 
fiduciary  duty, 
fully 
justifying 
the"
"termination of his employment."
"The Labour Tribunal’s decision to award substantial compensation"
"was not based on a proper appreciation of these facts or the relevant"
"legal  principles. 
Its 
failure 
to 
recognize 
the 
severity 
of 
the"
"misconduct, 
coupled  with 
the  proven  dishonest  handling 
of"
"company  funds,  led  to  an  outcome  that  was  both  unjustified  and"
"inequitable."
