"In the case of Richard Peiris and Co. Ltd. v D.J. Wijesiriwardena"
"(62 NLR 233), T.S. Fernando J. stated:"
"“In  regard  to  the  power  of  the  Tribunal  to  make  such  order  as"
"may  appear  to  it  to  be  just  and  equitable,  there  is  point  in"
"Counsel’s submission that justice and equity can themselves be"
"measured not according to the urgings of a kind heart, but only"
"within the framework of the law.”"
