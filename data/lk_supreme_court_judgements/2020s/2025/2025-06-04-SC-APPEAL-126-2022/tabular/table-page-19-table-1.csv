"in  handling  the  funds  collected  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent.  The"
"Applicant  admitted  to  auditors  that  he  collected  Rs.  456,972.57/-"
"from customers but failed to deposit the same into the Respondent’s"
"account. Furthermore, he did not maintain proper records or issue"
"receipts as required, making it impossible to verify his claim that the"
"funds  were  used  to  settle  other  outstanding  debts.  The  Labour"
"Tribunal failed to consider that the Applicant’s actions constituted a"
"serious breach of  financial  trust  and  responsibility,  which  directly"
"impacted  the Respondent’s business  operations. Had the Tribunal"
"properly  evaluated  the  evidence, 
it  would  have 
found  that  the"
"Applicant’s 
negligence 
and 
financial  misconduct 
warranted"
"termination.  I  also  find  that  the  Provincial  High  Court  erred  in"
"affirming  the  Tribunal’s  decision  without 
fully  appreciating  the"
"gravity of the Applicant’s misconduct. Therefore, the findings of both"
"the  Labour  Tribunal  and 
the  High  Court  are  perverse  and"
"unsupported  by 
the  evidence,  as 
they  have  misconstrued 
the"
"fundamental issue at hand."
"The  Provincial  High  Court, 
instead  of  critically  assessing 
the"
"Tribunal’s 
findings,  merely 
affirmed 
them  without 
properly"
"addressing this misinterpretation of the facts. As such, both findings"
"are perverse, unsupported by evidence, and legally unsound."
"The  second  question  of  law  pertains  to  the  appropriateness  and"
"fairness of the relief granted to the Respondent by both the Labour"
"Tribunal and the Provincial High Court. In particular, the Petitioner"
"challenges whether the relief awarded is just and equitable in light"
"of the facts of the case and whether it aligns with established legal"
"principles 
regarding 
the 
termination 
of 
employment 
and"
"compensation."
"To analyse this question, I will first consider the basis of the relief"
"awarded and examine whether it reflects the principles of fairness,"
"justice,  and 
legal  consistency 
in  employment 
law.  The  Labour"
"Tribunal  awarded  the  applicant  Rs.  1,487,430/-,  equivalent  to  42"
