"Contractors  Ltd  v.  Fareham  Urban  District  Council  [(1956]  AC  696  at  729]  where  Lord"
"Radcliffe held:"
"“[F]rustration  occurs  whenever the law recognizes that without default of either"
"party a contractural obligation has become incapable of being performed because"
"the  circumstances  in  which  performance  is  called  for  would  render  it  a  thing"
"radically different from that which was  undertaken by the contract. Non haec in"
"foedera veni. It was not this that I promised to do.”"
