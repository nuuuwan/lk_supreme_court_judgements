"their minds to it at the time they made their contract. By implying a term, it has been said"
"that “the law is only doing what the parties really (though subconsciously) meant to do"
"themselves” [Hirji Mulji v Cheong Yue Steamship Co Ltd [1926] AC 497 at 504 per Lord"
"Sumner]."
"Total 
failure  of  consideration  theory  has  been  used  to  describe  cases  where  the"
"supervening  event  renders  the  performance  of  one  party’s  obligations 
impossible."
"However, the total failure of consideration theory is difficult  to apply in cases where a"
"contract has been partly performed. In National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd.,"
"[supra. 702] Lord Simon said that, of all the theories, the total failure of consideration is"
"incompatible  with  the  application  of  the  doctrine  of  frustration  to  a  lease  precisely"
"because the lease will be partly executed at the time of the supervening event."
"In just outcome theory, the contract is discharged in order to avoid the perceived injustice"
"that would otherwise result from compelling the parties to undertake something totally"
"different from what they originally promised to do. It is in fact a theory founded upon a"
"principle captured in all the other theories."
"The frustration of the adventure or foundation of the contract forms the next theoretical"
"basis for the doctrine of frustration. This theory brings an objective focus on the event"
"and  its  occurrence  in  such  circumstances  as  show  it  to  be  inconsistent  with  further"
"prosecution of the adventure. The knowledge or intention of the parties are immaterial."
"A  theory  that  has  found  increasing  favour  in  recent  times  as  the  correct  basis  for  the"
"doctrine  of  frustration  is  the  construction  theory.  In  Davis  Contractors  Ltd  v.  Fareham"
"Urban  District  Council 
[supra.],  Lord  Reid  held 
that 
frustration  depends  on 
the"
"construction of the terms of the contract which should be read in light of the nature of"
"the contract and the relevant surrounding circumstances when the contract was made."
"He said [at page 721] : “The question is whether the contract … is, on its true construction,"
"wide enough to apply to the new situation: if it is not, then it is at an end.”"
