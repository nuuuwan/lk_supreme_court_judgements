"English law has used the doctrine of frustration in a restrictive sense. It is not lightly to be"
"invoked to relieve contracting parties of the normal consequences of imprudent bargains"
"and must be kept within very narrow limits and ought not be extended [Pioneer Shipping"
"Ltd. and Others v. B.T.P. Tioxide Ltd. (“The Nema”) (1982) AC 724 at 752; J. Lauritzen A.S."
"v. Wijsmuller B.V. (“The Super Servant Two”) (1990) 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 1 at 8]."
"To recapitulate, the position in English law, according to McKendrick [Contract Law, Text,"
"Cases and Materials, 2nd ed., 2005, Oxford, 868] is that the doctrine of frustration operates"
"to  discharge  a  contract  where,  after  the  formation  of  the  contract,  something  occurs"
"which  renders  performance  of  the  contract  impossible,  illegal,  or  something  radically"
"different from that which was in the contemplation of the parties at the time of entry into"
"the contract."
"Learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Respondent  drew  our  attention  to  the  decision  in"
"Bank of New York Mellon (International) Ltd v Cine-UK Ltd; London Trocadero (2015) LLP"
"v Picturehouse Cinemas Ltd and others [2022] EWCA Civ 1021. However, the facts of that"
"case differ from the facts of the present appeal. In that case, the tenants sought to resist"
"their respective landlords' claims for rent for periods when the COVID-19 pandemic meant"
"the demised premises could not be used as a cinema. The tenant inter alia contended that"
"it  was  relieved  from  the  obligation  to  pay  upon  a  true  construction  of  the  rent  cesser"
"provision in the lease. A rent cesser provision is a clause in a lease that provides for the"
"suspension of a tenant’s obligation to pay rent under certain circumstances (e.g. where"
"the whole or part of a premises is damaged or destroyed. The Court of Appeal held that"
"the rent cesser provision operated only where there was physical damage or destruction"
"to the property by an Insured Risk (as defined within the lease)."
