"“it  is  not  necessary  that  there  should  be  a  total  or  complete  destruction  of  the"
"subject matter of the contract. It is sufficient if the subject matter is affected in such"
"a way that the main purpose of the contract is defeated or cannot be performed."
"Thus even where there is an impairment or destruction not of the entirety but of"
"some attribute or quality which is essential to the particular contract, the contract"
"is discharged in the same way for the reason that performance is impossible.”"
