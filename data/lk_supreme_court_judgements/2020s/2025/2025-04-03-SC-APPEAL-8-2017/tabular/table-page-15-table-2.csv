"As  Lord  Wright  observed  in  Denny,  Mott  and  Dickson  Ltd.  v.  James  Fraser  &  Co.  Ltd."
"[(1944) AC 265 at 274-5]:"
"“Where,  as  generally  happens,  and  actually  happened  in  the  present  case,  one"
"party claims that there had been frustration and the other party contests it, the"
"court decides the issue and decides it ex post facto on the actual circumstances of"
"the case. The data for decision are, on the one hand the terms and conditions of the"
"contract, read in the light of the then existing circumstances, and on the other hand"
"the events which have occurred. It is the court which has to decided what is the true"
"position between the parties.”"
