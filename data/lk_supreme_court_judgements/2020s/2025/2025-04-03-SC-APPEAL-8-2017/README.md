Janak De Silva, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants (Appellants) and the Defendant-Appellant-

Respondent (Respondent) entered into a lease agreement No. 13548 dated 23.08.2004

(P1) (lease agreement). In terms of the lease agreement, all that soil plantations and

buildings bearing new assessment No. 524 at Pelana more fully described in the schedule

to the lease agreement was leased to the Appellants for a period of five (5) years

commencing on 15.11.2004. The leased premises included all fixtures, fittings and

equipment therein described in a separate inventory signed by the parties. In fact, parties

entered into agreement No. 3125 (V1) for the furniture, fittings and other movable

Page 4 of 20

property at the property forming the subject matter of this application. In terms of this

agreement, the movables described therein becomes part and parcel of the lease

agreement (P1).

Monthly rental for the first year commencing on 15.11.2004 was Euro 1400 per mensem

making the annual rental Euro 16800. Out of this, Euro 1500 was paid by the Appellants

on the date of execution of the lease agreement i.e. 23.08.2004. The Appellants further

credited Euro 5500 as part of the entire rental due for the first year immediately after one

week from the signing of the lease agreement. The entire balance of the lease rental for

the first year was paid by the Appellants on 15.11.2004 on which day the vacant

possession of the property was handed over to the Appellants. The Appellants also paid

Euros 2000 being the security deposit. These are admitted facts.

The dispute between the parties revolves on the damage caused to the property by the

tsunami that occurred on 26.12.2004. According to the Appellants the property was

destroyed resulting in the frustration of the contract.

Hence, the Appellants instituted this action to recover a sum of Euro 16840 (Sri Lankan

Rupees 21,50,299.60) being the balance from the lease rental paid after deducting the

rental due for the period 15.11.2004 to 26.12.2004. The Respondent denied this claim.

The learned District Judge held that although the property was not completely destroyed,

it was destroyed to the extent that it could not be used for the intended business and

entered judgment as prayed for in the plaint.

The Respondent appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of the Southern Province

holden at Matara (High Court).

The High Court held that upon a consideration of the entirety of evidence, it appears that

the discontinuation of the business was due to financial viability rather than impossibility.

It was further held that the learned District Judge has not considered the fact that the

Page 5 of 20

failure was due to cause other than frustration. The judgment of the learned District Judge

was set aside.

Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the Plaintiffs appealed.

Leave to appeal has been granted on the following question of law:

(1) Did the learned High Court Judges err in failing to consider the frustration of

adventure the Plaintiffs embarked upon by the Lease Agreement marked P1?

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant contended that the question is whether

there was a frustration of the venture. On the contrary, Learned Presidents Counsel for

the Respondent contended that the property forming the subject matter of the lease

agreement was not completely destroyed and hence the evidence does not establish

frustration.

Although this appeal must be determined by reference to the applicable law, which is the

Roman-Dutch law, both the Appellants and Respondent have cited several English

authorities in support of their respective cases. Hence, I wish to briefly examine the two

legal regimes to ascertain the respective positions on frustration or impossibility of

performance in deciding on the relevance of these English authorities.

English Law

The doctrine of frustration in English Law evolved to mitigate the rigour of the common

law position which insisted on literal performance of absolute promises.

The evolution began from the initial position that contracts were regarded as absolute and

impossibility of performance did not provide a ground for discharge of the contract. This

approach is exemplified in Paradine v. Jane [(1647) Aleyn 26] where it was held that

where a lessee covenant to repair a house, he ought to repair it even though it be burned

by lighting.

Page 6 of 20

A change of approach by the English Courts to this strict doctrine is seen in Atkinson v.

Ritchie [(1809) 10 East 530] which marked the initial acknowledgment of supervening

illegality as a valid basis for excusing contractual non-performance. According to

Weeramantry [Law of Contracts, Vol. 2, Stamford Lake Publications, 1967, 749], the

court's decision to deviate from the strict doctrine of absolute liability stemmed from

considerations of public policy, leading to the recognition of the need to accommodate

exceptional situations within the realm of contract law.

The recognition of legal impossibility provided a ground for the exception to be expanded

to physical impossibility. In Taylor v. Caldwell [(1863) 3 B & S 826] a music hall was hired

out for the purpose of holding a concert. The hall got destroyed by a fire. Blackburn J.

relied on civil law authority and held that impossibility would discharge a contract. He

justified his decision on the ground that if the fulfilment of a contract depends on the

continued existence of a certain thing, that contract is subject to an implied condition that

the parties shall be excused in case, before breach, performance becomes impossible

from the perishing of the thing without default of the contractor.

The doctrine was extended to cases where although the subject matter continued to be

in existence, it is not available for use during the period of the contract or its use in the

changed circumstances would be something radically different from that which was in the

contemplation of the parties at the time of entry into the contract [Jackson v. Union

Marine Insurance Co. Ltd. (1874) LR 10 CP 125].

In Krell v. Henry [(1903) 2 KB 740] there was an agreement to hire a flat. Both parties

were aware that it was for watching the coronation procession which got cancelled. It was

held that because the viewing of the procession had been the common foundation of the

contract, its purpose was frustrated and hence it was discharged. The decision was

premised on the fact that the foundation of the contract which is said to have collapsed

was common to both parties to the contract.

Page 7 of 20

Thus, the doctrine of frustration in English law applies to both physical impossibility as

well as legal impossibility. It applies where the performance of the contract subsequently

becomes impossible due to change in law [Denny, Mott & Dickson v. James B. Fraser &

Co. Ltd. (1944) AC 265] or a change in circumstances [Fibrosa Spolka Akeyjna v. Fairbairn,

Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd. (1943) AC 32].

The classic statement of the doctrine of frustration in English law is found in Davis

Contractors Ltd v. Fareham Urban District Council [(1956] AC 696 at 729] where Lord

Radcliffe held:

[F]rustration occurs whenever the law recognizes that without default of either

party a contractural obligation has become incapable of being performed because

the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing

radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract. Non haec in

foedera veni. It was not this that I promised to do.

The fact that it is impracticable to perform the contract is not generally a ground for

discharge in English law. In Tennants (Lancashire) Ltd v. CS Wilson & Co Ltd. [(1917) AC

495 at 510] Lord Loreburn said that [t]he argument that a man can be excused from

performance of his contract when it becomes commercially impossibleseems to me a

dangerous contention, which ought not to be admitted unless the parties have plainly

contracted to that effect. The dicta in Davis Contractors Ltd v. Fareham Urban District

Council [supra.] appears to indicate that there must be at least a hundredfold increase in

the cost for discharge to be recognised.

As the matter in issue is whether the lease agreement was frustrated, it is relevant to

examine the position in English law on this issue. In Cricklewood Property and Investment

Trust Ltd v Leightons Investment Trust Ltd. [(1945) AC 221, (1945) 1 All ER 252] the House

of Lords held that even if the doctrine of frustration were capable of application to a lease,

it did not apply to the specific circumstances of the case.

Page 8 of 20

The issue was put beyond doubt in National Carriers Ltd. v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd.

[(1981) 1 AC 675] where the House of Lords held (Lord Russell dubitante) that the doctrine

of frustration was capable of applying to an executed lease of land so as to bring the lease

to an end if a frustrating event (i.e. an event such that no substantial use, permitted by

the lease and in the contemplation of the parties, remained possible to the lessee)

occurred during the currency of the term. The decisive argument was the essential unity

of the law of contract and the belief that no type of contract should as a matter of law be

excluded from the doctrine.

Lord Simon held [at page 700] that:

frustration of a contract takes place when there supervenes an event (without

default of either party and for which the contract makes no sufficient provision)

which so significantly changes the nature (not merely the expense or onerousness)

of the outstanding contractual rights and/or obligations from what the parties

could reasonably have contemplated at the time of its execution that it would be

unjust to hold them to the literal sense of its stipulations in the new circumstances;

in such case the law declares both parties to be discharged from further

performance.

Several theories underpin the doctrine of frustration in English law. In National Carriers

Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd. [Ibid. 687-8] Lord Hailsham LC highlighted five theories

for frustration: the implied term theory, a total failure of consideration theory, the just

outcome theory, the frustration of the adventure or foundation of the contract theory

and the construction theory.

The implied term theory was the first of the theories to be used to justify the application

of the doctrine of frustration [See Taylor v Caldwell (supra.) where Blackburn J. discusses

the exceptions at pages 836-837]. This theory requires the court to ascertain what the

parties would have intended to happen following the supervening event, had they turned

Page 9 of 20

their minds to it at the time they made their contract. By implying a term, it has been said

that the law is only doing what the parties really (though subconsciously) meant to do

themselves [Hirji Mulji v Cheong Yue Steamship Co Ltd [1926] AC 497 at 504 per Lord

Sumner].

Total failure of consideration theory has been used to describe cases where the

supervening event renders the performance of one partys obligations impossible.

However, the total failure of consideration theory is difficult to apply in cases where a

contract has been partly performed. In National Carriers Ltd v Panalpina (Northern) Ltd.,

[supra. 702] Lord Simon said that, of all the theories, the total failure of consideration is

incompatible with the application of the doctrine of frustration to a lease precisely

because the lease will be partly executed at the time of the supervening event.

In just outcome theory, the contract is discharged in order to avoid the perceived injustice

that would otherwise result from compelling the parties to undertake something totally

different from what they originally promised to do. It is in fact a theory founded upon a

principle captured in all the other theories.

The frustration of the adventure or foundation of the contract forms the next theoretical

basis for the doctrine of frustration. This theory brings an objective focus on the event

and its occurrence in such circumstances as show it to be inconsistent with further

prosecution of the adventure. The knowledge or intention of the parties are immaterial.

A theory that has found increasing favour in recent times as the correct basis for the

doctrine of frustration is the construction theory. In Davis Contractors Ltd v. Fareham

Urban District Council [supra.], Lord Reid held that frustration depends on the

construction of the terms of the contract which should be read in light of the nature of

the contract and the relevant surrounding circumstances when the contract was made.

He said [at page 721] : The question is whether the contract is, on its true construction,

wide enough to apply to the new situation: if it is not, then it is at an end.

Page 10 of 20

English law has used the doctrine of frustration in a restrictive sense. It is not lightly to be

invoked to relieve contracting parties of the normal consequences of imprudent bargains

and must be kept within very narrow limits and ought not be extended [Pioneer Shipping

Ltd. and Others v. B.T.P. Tioxide Ltd. (The Nema) (1982) AC 724 at 752; J. Lauritzen A.S.

v. Wijsmuller B.V. (The Super Servant Two) (1990) 1 Lloyds Rep. 1 at 8].

To recapitulate, the position in English law, according to McKendrick [Contract Law, Text,

Cases and Materials, 2nd ed., 2005, Oxford, 868] is that the doctrine of frustration operates

to discharge a contract where, after the formation of the contract, something occurs

which renders performance of the contract impossible, illegal, or something radically

different from that which was in the contemplation of the parties at the time of entry into

the contract.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondent drew our attention to the decision in

Bank of New York Mellon (International) Ltd v Cine-UK Ltd; London Trocadero (2015) LLP

v Picturehouse Cinemas Ltd and others [2022] EWCA Civ 1021. However, the facts of that

case differ from the facts of the present appeal. In that case, the tenants sought to resist

their respective landlords' claims for rent for periods when the COVID-19 pandemic meant

the demised premises could not be used as a cinema. The tenant inter alia contended that

it was relieved from the obligation to pay upon a true construction of the rent cesser

provision in the lease. A rent cesser provision is a clause in a lease that provides for the

suspension of a tenants obligation to pay rent under certain circumstances (e.g. where

the whole or part of a premises is damaged or destroyed. The Court of Appeal held that

the rent cesser provision operated only where there was physical damage or destruction

to the property by an Insured Risk (as defined within the lease).

Roman-Dutch Law

The doctrine of impossibility of performance forms part of the Roman Law and the

Roman-Dutch Law.

The theoretical origin of the doctrine of impossibility in Roman-Dutch Law is the principle

of clausula rebus sic stantibus, which means "things thus standing". It recognises that

contracts are based on the hypothesis that the conditions at the time of contracting will

remain unchanged. Where unforeseen events occur that make the performance of the

contract impossible or radically different, it provides the theoretical justification for the

doctrine on impossibility of performance to be applied so that the contract can be

discharged. The doctrine is grounded on fairness and equity. It prevents parties from being

bound by contracts when it would be unreasonable or unjust to enforce them.

Buckland [A Manual of Roman Private Law, 1953, Cambridge, 342] states that an obligatio

may cease to exist due to supervening impossibility and gives the example of destruction

of subject matter.

Grotius in The Introduction to Dutch Jurisprudence [Translated by Charles Herbert

(London: John Van Voorst and another, 1844) page 326] states:

The extinction of the thing extinguishes the obligation when something specific

was the object of the obligation, and the extinction took place without neglect of

the debtor, and before the time of making default in payment, or before the time

when the thing ceases to be an article of commerce.

Lee in An Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law [5th ed., 276] states that if a contract, possible

when made, subsequently becomes impossible of performance, the parties are

sometimes discharged from future liability. Whether this will be so or not depends upon

the nature of the contract and the circumstances of each particular case.

Page 12 of 20

Weeramantry in The Law of Contracts [supra. 747] states that the doctrine that a contract

was discharged by supervening impossibility was well recognised by Roman and Roman-

Dutch law. Where performance becomes impossible either physically or legally, the debtor

is discharged from liability if the impossibility of performance is due vis major or causus

fortuitus.

The terms vis major and casus fortuitus are concepts derived from the Roman Dutch Law.

Vis major or superior force is some force, power or agency which cannot be resisted or

controlled by the ordinary individual [Benoni Produce and Coal Co. Ltd. v. Minister of

Railways and Harbours (1914) WLD 31 at 35]. This term is now used as including not only

the acts of nature or vis divina (act of God) but the act of man as well [Peters, Flamman

& Co. v. Kokstad Municipality (1919) AD 427 at 435]. Casus fortuitus (inevitable accident)

is a species of vis major and includes all direct acts of nature, the violence of which could

not reasonably have been foreseen or guarded against [New Heriot Gold Mining Co. Ltd.

v. Union Government [(1916) AD 415 at 433].

Whether the supervening event of vis major or casus fortuitus results in impossibility of

performance will depend on a number of factors.

The test for determining impossibility under the Roman-Dutch law is explained in

Hersman v. Shapiro & Co. [1926 TPD 367 at 372-8] where Stratford J. held that one must:

look to the nature of the contract, the relation of the parties, the circumstances of

the case, and the nature of the impossibility invoked by the defendant to see

whether the contract should be discharged.

Page 13 of 20

The present position in Roman-Dutch law is succinctly stated in Transnet Ltd t/a National

Ports Authority v. owner of MV Snow Crystal [2008(4) SA 111 (SCA) para 28 (authorities

omitted)] as follows:

As a general rule impossibility of performance brought about by a vis major or

casus fortuitus will excuse performance of a contract. But it will not always do so.

In each case it is necessary to look to the nature of the contract, the relation of the

parties, the circumstances of the case, and the nature of the impossibility invoked

by the defendant, to see whether the general rule ought, in the particular

circumstances of the case, to be applied. The rule will not avail a defendant if the

impossibility is self-created, nor will it avail the defendant if the impossibility is due

to his or her fault.

Having set out the respective position in English law and Roman-Dutch law on frustration

and impossibility of performance respectively, it is apparent that there are strong

similarities between the two doctrines [Nuclear Fuels Corporation of SA (Pty) Ltd. v. Orda

AG 1996 (4) SA 1190 (A) at 1214C].

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondent drew our attention to Weeramantry

[supra. page 746] where he states that although there is fundamental difference in

approach between Roman-Dutch law and English law to the question of impossibility of

performance or frustration, through a long process of development English law has been

brought very close to Civil law in its practical application.

However, there is a fundamental difference between the two legal systems in the starting

point of the application of the two doctrines.

In English law, the rule is that court starts with the contract and remains with the contract

throughout, looking exclusively at it to ascertain what the effect of any supervening

conditions should be in law.

Page 14 of 20

On the contrary, in Roman-Dutch law, Court begins by implying a term into the contract

exempting a party from liability when through no fault of his own the contract becomes

impossible of performance. Thereafter, the Court looks to the contract, to see how that

implied term should be applied in regard to the specific facts of the particular contract

involved. In other words, in Roman-Dutch law, the rule is that impossibility of performance

does in general excuse the performance of a contract unless the particular circumstances

of the case, the nature of the contract and the nature of the impossibility invoked by the

defendant displaces the general rule.

Therefore, this distinction must be borne in mind in using any English authority.

Application of the Doctrine to the Factual Circumstances

Before applying the legal principles, it is important to describe the property in issue. It

consisted of four two storied buildings, each containing two rooms, one on the ground

floor and the other on the first floor. There were eight rooms in total. These rooms were

situated around 50 meters away from the sea. There was another building which was to

be used as a restaurant with a seating capacity for forty persons. It was situated about 100

meters away from the sea.

The Respondent had begun construction of the premises in 2004. She had met the

Appellants during the time it was under construction. She came to know that the

Appellants were looking for a property to be used as a tourist resort. Acting on their

request, the Respondent expedited the construction by using additional labour and

handed it over to the Appellants on 15.11.2004. It was admittedly furnished to be used as

a tourist resort and was described by the Respondent as luxury accommodation.

The parties were not at variance on whether tsunami was a vis major or casus fortuitus.

Indeed, it is beyond debate that a tsunami is a vis major or casus fortuitus. As held in

Alibhoy v. The Ceylon Wharfage Co. Ltd. [56 NLR 470 at 476] under modern conditions,

Page 15 of 20

the term vis major is not necessarily restricted to "an act of God" or to the consequences

of piracy, ship-wreck, thunder, lightning, or hostile action by the Queen's enemies.

The issue on which the parties are at variance is the extent of damage caused by the

tsunami to the property. It is this very intricate issue that we are required to determine as

one of the fundamental issues in this case.

As Lord Wright observed in Denny, Mott and Dickson Ltd. v. James Fraser & Co. Ltd.

[(1944) AC 265 at 274-5]:

Where, as generally happens, and actually happened in the present case, one

party claims that there had been frustration and the other party contests it, the

court decides the issue and decides it ex post facto on the actual circumstances of

the case. The data for decision are, on the one hand the terms and conditions of the

contract, read in the light of the then existing circumstances, and on the other hand

the events which have occurred. It is the court which has to decided what is the true

position between the parties.

According to the Appellants, the property was heavily damaged. The restaurant and the

surrounding wall had collapsed. All the equipment in the restaurant had got washed away.

The four buildings also suffered heavy damage. Two foreigners who were staying at the

tourist resort died.

The Respondent denied that the property was fully damaged. Although she admitted that

the restaurant was fully destroyed, it was contended that the upstairs rooms could have

been rented. However, when pressed in cross-examination she conceded that the toilet

facilities for the said rooms could not have been provided as they were destroyed. It was

her contention that property could have been renovated and the business of the

Appellants carried on.

Page 16 of 20

In this context, the evidence of Viraj Jeewantha, former Grama Niladhari of the area is

vital to obtain an independent and objective description of the damage caused to the

property. He testified that the first floors of the four buildings did not suffer much damage.

However, the ground floors were fully damaged. The doors and windows were washed

away. The kitchen was also fully damaged. The furniture had been swept away. The

restaurant was a total destruction. His evidence on these matters were not challenged in

cross-examination which was directed more towards eliciting the fact that the buildings

and kitchen could have been renovated.

Moreover, the evidence of the Respondent is contradicted by the statement she made to

the Police within a few days of the tsunami on 05.01.2005. It is stated therein that the

restaurant was completely damaged. Furthermore, she states that the cost of the damage

to the restaurant and the buildings is around Rs. 6 million. This provides a good

assessment of the damage caused to the property due to the tsunami.

In the context of the above evidence, it is clear that although the property was not

completely destroyed, it had suffered heavy damage. The restaurant was completely

destroyed. The furniture, doors and windows had been washed away. The property was

in no condition to be used as a tourist resort.

Here, it is important to note that Weeramantry is of the view that [supra. page 751]:

it is not necessary that there should be a total or complete destruction of the

subject matter of the contract. It is sufficient if the subject matter is affected in such

a way that the main purpose of the contract is defeated or cannot be performed.

Thus even where there is an impairment or destruction not of the entirety but of

some attribute or quality which is essential to the particular contract, the contract

is discharged in the same way for the reason that performance is impossible.

Page 17 of 20

I must now examine the provisions of the lease agreement to ascertain whether parties

had allocated the risks arising from this event between them. In other words, did they

contemplate of the consequences of a tsunami and the damage caused thereby.

In doing so, the starting position in the Roman-Dutch law is that Court implies a term into

the contract exempting a party from liability when through no fault of his own the contract

becomes impossible of performance. Thereafter, the Court looks to the contract, to see

how that rule should be applied in regard to the specific facts of the particular contract

involved.

The Respondent contends that the lease agreement has made provision for such an

eventuality. In particular our attention was drawn to Clauses 8 and 12 therein.

Clause 8 of the lease agreement states that the lessor shall, upon being informed by the

lessees, make all repairs necessary major structural repairs to the premises with any other

minor repairs due in terms of Clause 7.

The structural repairs contemplated in this clause does not in my view cover structural

repairs arising from a tsunami. The damage from a tsunami was never in contemplation

by the parties. This becomes clear upon an examination of Clause 12 which refers only to

civil commotion, riots, floods and fire.

In any event, it covers only structural damages. No provision is made for damage to the

for the furniture, fittings and other movable property referred to in agreement V1. It is

clear that these furniture, fittings and other movable property was an integral part of the

premises leased for a tourist resort.

I am of the view that Clause 12 of the lease agreement does not displace the implied rule

in Roman-Dutch law. Firstly, it exempts the lessee from being liable to pay for any damages

incurred due to civil commotion, riots, floods and fire. Secondly, the lessee is made liable

for damages caused to the demised premises as a result of any act or wilful default of the

Page 18 of 20

lessee or their employees, workers, servants or any other person acting under their

authority.

It is important to note that both parties were aware that the property was being leased

to be used as a tourist resort. In fact, admittedly the property was constructed and

furnished with that objective in mind. The lease agreement covered both soil plantations

and buildings standing thereon together with all fixtures, fittings and equipment

described in agreement No. 3125 (V1) entered into between parties.

In my view, these facts plainly establish that the state of things both parties clearly

intended was that the property will continue to remain in a fit condition for it to be used

as a tourist resort. However, the damage caused by the tsunami to the property changed

this position. The property was damaged to such an extent that it was not possible for it

to be maintained as a tourist resort unless restored to its former condition at a cost of

around Rs. 6 million. This is nearly the total of three years lease rental.

There is no term in the lease agreement which requires any party to spend such a large

sum of money to renovate the property due to damage caused by a tsunami.

Moreover, in invoking the doctrine of impossibility to perform, the Appellants are not

seeking to avoid a bad bargain made by them as contended by the Respondent. Rather,

they seek to be excused from the performance of their bargain due to an event beyond

the control of either party which resulted in a change of the fundamental status of things

envisaged by both parties at the time the lease agreement was made.

Besides, that event and its consequences were never in the contemplation of the parties.

Hence the parties never made provision for the event and its consequences in the lease

agreement (P1) or the agreement (V1).

Page 19 of 20

In Roman-Dutch Law, the doctrine of supervening impossibility involves implying a term

into the contract exempting a party from liability when through no fault of his own the

contract becomes impossible of performance. According to Weeramantry [supra. 747],

such an implication arises when the subject matter of the contract is destroyed or when

the condition or state of things contemplated by the parties as the foundation of their

contract has ceased to exist or not been realised or if performance becomes legally

impossible (emphasis added).

It will be unreasonable and unjust to hold the Appellants and the Respondent to the lease

agreement and require performance when the state of things contemplated by the parties

as the foundation of their contract has ceased to exist.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Appellants have established that there has

been a frustration of the adventure that they embarked upon due to the tsunami. I answer

the question of law in the affirmative.

The Appellants are claiming the balance of the lease rental after deducting rental for the

limited period of use by them. In Punchisingho v. De Silva [38 NLR 416] it was held that a

tenant is entitled to a full or partial refund of rent in cases where a vis major or casus

fortuitus has prevented him from using the property for the purposes for which it was

leased, either completely or to a significant extent. The decision was based on the

common law principle that a tenant is entitled to remission of rent either wholly or in part

where he has been prevented either entirely or to a considerable extent from making use

of the property for the purposes for which it was let, by some vis major or casus fortuitus,

provided always that the loss of enjoyment of the property is the direct and immediate

result of the vis major or casus fortuitus, and is not merely indirectly or remotely

connected therewith.

The Appellants are thus entitled to the relief claimed.
