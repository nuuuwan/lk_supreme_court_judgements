RESPONDENT

Page 4 of 13

Janak De Silva, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (Plaintiff) instituted this action against the

Defendants-Respondents-Appellants (Defendants) praying for a declaration that the

1st Defendant is holding the property described in the Second Schedule to the plaint,

which was transferred by Deed No. 1455, in trust for the Plaintiff, for a declaration

that the 1st Defendant did not have and do not have any beneficial interest in the

property, to set aside Deed No. 1455 on the principle of laesio enormis, for a direction

to the 1st Defendant to retransfer the property to the Plaintiff and in the alternative

for a direction to the Registrar of Court to effect a retransfer to the Plaintiff and for

costs of the action.

The Plaintiff claims that the transfer of land to the 1st Defendant was executed merely

as security for a loan, while the Defendants maintain that it was an outright sale for

valuable consideration.

The property described in the First Schedule to the plaint was originally held by the

Plaintiff and her husband, Wilson Perera, by virtue of Deed No. 331. At one stage

Wilson Perera required funds and, by Deed No. 118, the land was conveyed as security

to Somalatha Perera for a loan of Rs.150,000/=. Upon repayment, that loan was

discharged and the land reconveyed to Wilson Perera and the Plaintiff.

Subsequently needing further funds, the Plaintiff executed Deed No. 16824 in favour

of Gnanaratna Ramanayake as a security and obtained Rs.200,000/=. When

Ramanayake demanded repayment, the Plaintiff procured Rs. 175,000/= from

Wannipulli Arachchige Swarnalatha and settled Ramanayaka’s debt.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff executed Deed No. 2677 in favour of Swarnalatha as security

for the said loan. Following partial repayment, Swarnalatha partitioned the property

described in the First Schedule, into three lots: Lot A1, Lot A2, and Lot A3 (the roadway)

and reconveyed Lot A1, to the Plaintiff by Deed No. 2839 dated 20.07.1995.

Page 5 of 13

Subsequently, further sums fell due and Swarnalatha demanded payment of the

outstanding balance. The Plaintiff, being unable to raise the required funds, requested

Swarnalatha to execute a transfer in favour of the 1st Defendant. Accordingly,

Swarnalatha executed Deed No. 1455, transferring Lot A2,the portion described in the

Second Schedule to the plaint to the 1st Defendant, who advanced a sum of

Rs.150,000/=.

The Plaintiff’s case is that this transfer was executed only as security for the loan and

that the Defendants agreed to reconvey the property upon repayment. When the

Respondent sought to repay the loan, the Defendants purportedly demanded a higher

sum and refused reconveyance. On learning that the Defendants intended to sell or

otherwise dispose of the property, the Plaintiff lodged a caveat in the Land Registry.

Before the District Court and the High Court, the Plaintiff contended that the earlier

transfers, beginning with Deed No. 16824 executed in favour of Ramanayaka, had

given rise to a trust in her favour. She maintained that both Ramanayaka and,

subsequently, Swarnalatha had held the property under the same trust. She

contended that the present transaction with the 1st Defendant, effected by Deed No.

1455, was of a similar nature and likewise intended to operate as a security, thereby

giving rise to a constructive trust in her favour.

The Plaintiff relied principally on oral evidence of an understanding that the transfers

were security arrangements and on certain attendant circumstances to show that the

beneficial interest never passed. The Defendants, however, denied any promise as

such and asserted that the transfer under Deed No. 1455 was an outright purchase for

valuable consideration.

The 1st Defendant was found to hold all original title deeds, to have registered her

name in the assessment records and to have paid Municipal assessment charges since

1999. Evidence before Court included admissions that Swarnalatha had been in

possession when she received title from Ramanayaka and that title searches trace

Page 6 of 13

ownership through the chain from Ramanayaka to Swaranalataha and then to the 1st

Appellant.

After trial, the learned District Judge dismissed the Plaintiff’s action, holding in favour

of the Defendants. The District Court primarily grounded its decision on the question

of ownership, concluding that as the Plaintiff was not the transferor of the property,

no trust could validly arise in her favour.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the learned District Judge, the Plaintiff

appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of the Western Province holden in Mount

Lavinia. The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court set aside the judgment

of the District Court and entered judgment in favour of the Plaintiff.

Leave to appeal has been granted on the following questions of law:

1. Whether the learned High Court Judges has misdirected themselves in holding

that the 1st Defendant is holding the property more fully described in

the Second Schedule to the plaint, by Deed No. 1455 dated 24.12.1998, in trust

for the benefit of the Plaintiff?

2. Whether the learned High Court Judges erred in concluding that the 1st

Defendant holds Lot A1 in trust for the Plaintiff, within the meaning and

application of Section 84 of the Trusts Ordinance ?

The two grounds on which leave to appeal has been granted are, in

essence, correlative, as the learned High Court Judge’s finding that the 1st Defendant

holds the property in trust for the Plaintiff is solely premised on the application of

Section 84 of the Trusts Ordinance, which forms the basis of the second question of

law.

Page 7 of 13

Therefore, in addressing the first question, I will first examine whether there exists any

other provision in the Trusts Ordinance that may give rise to a trust applicable to the

present case, if at all. The specific applicability and interpretation of Section 84 will

thereafter be dealt with comprehensively when examining the second question of law.

Let me however begin by expounding the provisions in Chapter IX of the Trusts

Ordinance which creates 13 separate constructive trust doctrines as follows:

Section 83: Where it does not appear that transferor intended to dispose of

beneficial interest

Section 84: Transfer to one for consideration paid by another

Section 85: Trust incapable of execution or executed without exhausting

Trust property

Section 86: Transfer for illegal purpose

Section 87: Bequest for illegal purpose

Section 88: Transfer pursuant to rescindable contract

Section 89: Debtor becoming creditor’s representative

Section 90: Advantage gained by fiduciary

Section 91: Advantage gained by exercise of undue influence

Section 92: Advantage gained by qualified owner

Section 93: Property acquired with notice of existing contract

Section 94: Purchase by person contracting to buy property to be held on

trust

Page 8 of 13

Section 95: Advantage secretly gained by one of several compounding

creditors

Section 96: Constructive Trusts in cases not expressly provided for

Question of Law No. 1

The Defendants contended, inter alia, that the Plaintiff was not the owner of the

property at the time of execution of Deed No. 1455, and that the 1st Defendant had not

purchased the said land from the Plaintiff but from Swarnalatha, who held valid title

and possession at the time of transfer. Swarnalatha resurveyed the property described

the First Schedule, divided it into Lots A1 ,A2 and A3, and transferred Lot A2, as

described in the Second Schedule to the plaint, to the 1st Defendant for valuable

consideration. The Defendants, maintain that the Plaintiff had already lost title to the

entirety of the land described in the First Schedule at the time of execution of Deed

No. 16824, and that the Plaintiff could not thereafter have conveyed any interest.

The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court, in allowing the appeal, held that

the initial transfer of the property by the Plaintiff to Gnanaratna Ramanayake was not

an outright conveyance, but one made as security for a loan, and therefore

Ramanayake, on a balance of probability, held the property in trust for the

Respondent within the meaning of Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance. However, the

Court observed that such a trust does not automatically pass from one transferee to

another upon subsequent conveyances, and thus the application of Section 83

fails beyond the initial transaction.

Section 83 read as follows:

“Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it and it cannot be

reasonably inferred consistently with the attendant circumstances that he

intended to dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee

must hold property for benefit.” (emphasis added)

Page 9 of 13

The trust contemplated in this section, arises only between the owner of the property

and the transferee or legatee. This section does not envisage, either expressly or by

implication, the creation of a trust in favour of a third party who is not the owner of

the property. Therefore, any attempt to extend the application of Section 83 to

transactions involving a third-party beneficiary falls outside the scope and intent of

the provision.

In Weragoda Aarchchillage Weraj Sharm Weragoda v. Kullaperuma Aarchchilage

Kusumawathie and Others [S.C. Appeal No. 09/2011, S.C.M. 29.06.2018]

Wanasundera, P.C. J., held (at page 11) :

“The concept of trust does not pass automatically from one person to another

with regard to the property and with regard to the original transferor since

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance does not provide for such a reasoning to

imply a constructive trust at all. The property can change hands but the trust

created in the first deed of transfer cannot get attached to every change of hand

of the property and end up with a different transferee who cannot be held in

law to own the property on trust for the first transferor of the first deed in the

chain of deeds executed thereafter.”

Moreover, it was the Plaintiff who requested Swarnalatha to execute a transfer in

favour of the 1st Defendant which was done by Deed No. 1455, transferring Lot A2,the

portion described in the Second Schedule to the plaint, to the 1st Appellant.

In Vandervell v. Inland revenue Commissioner [(1967) 1 All E.R 1 at 7], Lord Upjohn

held that:

“If the intention of the beneficial owner in directing the trustee to transfer the

legal estate to x is that x should be the beneficial owner, I can see no reason for

any further document or further works in the document assigning the legal

estate also expressly transferring the beneficial interest; the greater includes the

less”.

Page 10 of 13

The documentary evidence reveal, inter alia, that the Plaintiff herself had attested as

one of the witnesses to the disputed Deed No. 1455 (P7), and in cross-examination

admitted to the execution and transfer of ownership of Lot A1 in favour of the 1s

Defendant.

In Edirisinghe v. Charles Singho [(2000) 3 Sri LR 380] a tenant cultivator signed as a

witness to a deed of transfer of the land over which he claimed to have ande rights. It

was held that from the conduct of the tenant in consenting to be an attesting witness

to such a transaction which purports to transfer ande rights, active assent on the part

of the Respondent to the waiver or surrender of his rights may be inferred.

Hence even assuming that Swarnalatha was holding the land in trust for the Plaintiff,

the above transfer done on the direction of the Plaintiff is sufficient to transfer the

beneficial interest, if any, which survived with the Plaintiff to the 1st Defendant.

In Liyana Athukoralage Indrawathie v. Galolu Kankanamlage Dharmasena and

Another [S. C. Appeal No 190/2016, S.C.M. 02.10.2023], relying on Vandervell

(supra), I held that (at page 14):

“Where it can be shown that the beneficial owner directed the trustee to transfer

the legal interest in the trust to a third party so that the third party becomes both

the beneficial and legal owner, no further documentation is needed secure the

title of the third party. Any trust that existed as between the trustee and the

beneficial owner ceases to exist and the third party becomes the absolute owner

of the trust property.”

Having examined the scope of the other provisions of Chapter IX of the Trusts

Ordinance, I hold that the factual circumstances of this action does not fall within

Section 83 or any of the other constructive trusts expounded in the other provisions

therein.

Page 11 of 13

Question of Law No. 2

The learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court, having found that the provisions

of Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance did not extend to subsequent transfers,

proceeded to consider the applicability of Section 84 which reads as follows:

“Where property is transferred to one person for a consideration paid or provided

by another person and it appears that such person did not intend to pay or provide

such consideration for the benefit of the transferee the transferee must hold the

property for the benefit of the person paying or providing the consideration."

There are two requirements that must be fulfilled for the constructive trust

contemplated therein to come into existence.

Firstly, the consideration for the transfer must be paid or provided by a person other

than the transferee. Secondly, it must appear that such person did not intend to pay

or provide such consideration for the benefit of the transferee.

Accordingly, for the Plaintiff to succeed in establishing a constructive trust within

Section 84, the Plaintiff has to establish:

(a)that the consideration was paid or provided by the Plaintiff though the

property was transferred in the name of the 1st Defendant.

(b)that the Plaintiff did not intend to pay or provide such consideration for the

benefit of the 1st Defendant.

In this action, the first fundamental element is absent. It is clear from the evidence

that the consideration for the purchase of Lot A2 was paid by the 2A Defendant (1st

Defendant’s husband), to the transferor, Swarnalatha Perera, and obtained title under

Deed No. 1455 dated 24.12.1998, and not by the Plaintiff. Accordingly, the essential

requirement for invoking Section 84, that the Plaintiff provided the consideration

is not established, and the High Court’s conclusion that a constructive trust arose in

favour of the Plaintiff under Section 84 of the Trusts Ordinance cannot be sustained.

Page 12 of 13

Finally, having regard to the 1st Defendant’s claim as a bona fide purchaser for value

without notice, it is necessary to consider the relevant circumstances and their bearing

on the present dispute. Cooray [L.J.M Cooray, The Reception in Ceylon of the English

Trust, (1971), pages 183-185] has stated that to take free of the trust, “the transferee,

under 66(1)(a) must prove that (i) he did not have notice and (ii) he paid

consideration”.

In the present action, consideration amounting to Rs. 150,000/= passed from the

Defendants to Swarnalatha.

On the question of notice, Section 3(j) of the Trust Ordinance states that:

“A person is said to have notice of a fact either when he actually knows that

fact, or when, but for willful abstention from inquiry or gross negligence, he

would have known it, or when information of the fact is given to or obtained by

any person whom the court may determine to have been his agent for the

purpose of receiving or obtaining such information”.

Although the Plaintiff accompanied the 1st Defendant to Swarnalatha, there was no

evidence of any agreement for reconveyance or of a pre-existing trust over the

property; instead, the 1st Defendant had conducted a title search to verify the previous

owners. Thus, there is no clear evidence to support the contention that Defendants

had actual notice or constructive notice of such alleged agreement between the

Respondent and Swarnalatha.

In Warnakulasuriyage Charlert Kusumawathi Kulasuriya v. Don Wimal Harischandra

Gunathilaka (S.C appeal 157/2011, S.C.M. 04.04.2014] Tilakawardane, J. held (at page

14):

“Having established that the Respondent is a bona fide purchaser, it is well

established law that where the legal title has passed to a bona fide purchaser

for value without notice, equity refuses to intervene to preserve any rights held

Page 13 of 13

by the former beneficial owner of the property. This is further affirmed by

Section 98 of the Trusts Ordinance which states that “Nothing contained in this

Chapter shall impair the rights of transferees in good faith for valuable

consideration.” Therefore, even if a constructive trust could have been

established, a prayer to grant possession of the property to the Petitioner will

not stand as the property has already passed into the hands of a bona fide

purchaser. This case underscores the necessity for parties to formalize their

transactions with clarity and legal precision. Reliance on oral assurances and

informal arrangements in property dealings gives rise to uncertainty and

protracted litigation. The law of trusts, being rooted in equity, must not be

stretched to cover every moral or relational obligation, especially at the expense

of legal certainty. It is therefore incumbent on the public to ensure that their

intentions, particularly where property is concerned, are reduced to writing and

duly executed, safeguarding both ownership and trust alike.”

For all the foregoing reasons, I answer the two questions of law in the affirmative.

Accordingly, I set aside the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated

10.09.2020 and affirm the judgment of the District Court of Mount Lavinia dated

19.10.2016. The appeal is allowed with costs fixed at Rs. 75,000/=.
