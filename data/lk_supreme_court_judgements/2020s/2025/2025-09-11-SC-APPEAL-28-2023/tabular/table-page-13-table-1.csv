"This approach is supported by the other requirements in both P4 and P7. According to"
"Clause 01, all posts where Specialist Medical Officers have completed 04 years from the"
"effective date of transfer order by 31.12.2020 are considered as listed vacant posts. These"
"are the posts for which the annual transfers were to be made. Clause 04 states that the"
"annual transfers will take effect from 01.01.2021 although both P4 and P7 were issued in"
"March and April, 2021."
"When examined from that perspective, the Respondent was not Board Certified as at that"

"This is consistent with the position set out in Clause 6.3.11 of the Medical Service Minute"
"dated 22.03.2001 which states that those who are eligible to apply for special posts are"
"only those who have got Board Certification and not those who are eligible to get Board"
"Certification.  The  position  is  the  same  in  the  Clause  11.2.1  of  the  Amended  Medical"
"Service Minute."
"Admittedly, the name of the Respondent was contained in the Draft Marks List. According"
"to the Petitioners, the Draft Marks List is based on the information and marks given by the"
"applicants themselves and are not verified and checked."
"Subsequently, on 24.05.2021, an Amended Draft List was posted on the official website of"
"the Ministry of Health in which the name of the Respondent was removed. The Amended"
"Draft List is prepared after verification by the Petitioners against the personal files of the"
"applicants."
"In these circumstances, there is nothing wrong in the authorities removing the name of"
"the Respondent from the Final Marks List, on the basis that she was not qualified, as the"
"Draft Marks List was an unperfected decision. In L.J.K. Hettiarachchi and Another v. Pearl"
