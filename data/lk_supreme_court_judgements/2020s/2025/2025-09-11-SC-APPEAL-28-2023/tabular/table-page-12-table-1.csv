"In  the  circumstances,  it  was  held  that,  the  Consultants'  Transfer  Board  misled  itself  in"
"supposing that the petitioner was not eligible for appointment and failed to afford her"
"equal treatment in terms of the Minute on Health (as amended) and read with the Circular"
"Letter of the 09.05.1997."
"However, there is an important factual difference in the matter before us. Clause 5E in"
"both P4 and P7 specifically requested the applicants to attach the Board Certification letter"
"certified by PGIM along with the application. This is a clear indication that as at the closing"
"date of applications, it is a  requirement that documentary proof of Board Certification"
"should be available."
"Hence  the  Court  of  Appeal  erred  in  applying  the  ratio  of  the  decision  in  Dr.  Preethi"
"Weerasekera (supra) to this application."
"Moreover,  the  Petitioner  did  not  seek  to  impugn  either  P4  or  P7.  According  to  the"
"‘presumption of validity’, administrative action is presumed to be valid unless or until it is"
"set aside by a Court [F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. A.G. and Others v. Secretary of State"
"for Trade and Industry (1975) A.C. 295; Lord Hoffmann in Regina v. Wicks (1998) A.C. 92"
"at 115; Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 A.C."
"143 at 156 and 161, and 173-4]."
"Hence, the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the requirement of possessing a Board"
"Certificate physically by 31.12.2020 is not clearly reflected in P4 or P7."
"Furthermore, it is erroneous to consider the requirement of possessing Board Certification"
"as at 31.12.2020 from the point of time when the applications are considered. Admittedly,"
"the transfers for 2021 were to take effect from 01.01.2021. Obtaining Board Certification"
"after that date although backdated to 2018 is irrelevant. In my view, the requirement in"
"Clause 5E must be considered as at 31.12.2020."
