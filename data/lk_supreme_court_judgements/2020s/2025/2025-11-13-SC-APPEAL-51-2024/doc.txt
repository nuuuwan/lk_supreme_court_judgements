M. Sampath K. B. Wijeratne J.

Background

The Plaintiff–Respondent–Petitioner–Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff–Appellant) instituted this action in the District Court seeking to

partition the land known as “Bulugahawatta.” After taking the preliminary

steps, including the registration of lis pendens and the service of summons, a

commission was issued to Mr. U. R. Edirisinghe, Licensed Surveyor, for the

preparation of the preliminary plan. Upon executing the commission, the

Commissioner tendered Plan No. 242 (marked ‘X’) together with the

corresponding report (marked ‘X1’).

Upon service of summons, the 1st Defendant–Respondent–Respondent–

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Defendant–Respondent) and the

15th to 21st Defendants–Respondents–Respondents–Respondents (hereinafter

referred to as the 15th to 21st Defendants–Respondents) appeared in Court and

filed their respective statements of claim. On 6th June 1988, the 22nd and 23rd

Defendants–Respondents were added as parties to the action, and they

thereafter filed their statements of claim.

The 2nd and 3rd Defendants–Respondents–Respondents–Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the 2nd and 3rd Defendants–Respondents), the 4th to

6th Defendants–Petitioners–Respondents–Respondents (hereinafter referred to

as the 4th to 6th Defendants–Respondents), and the 7th Defendant–

Respondent–Respondent–Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 7th

Defendant–Respondent) were served with summons and Journal Entry No. 10

dated 22nd October 1986 records that Mr. Gafoor, Attorney-at-Law, had

11

tendered a proxy on behalf of all of them. Upon tendering the proxy, Mr.

Gafoor moved to file statements of claim after the return of the commission.

However, a subsequent report of the Registrar of the District Court reveals that

the 2nd, 3rd, and 7th Defendants–Respondents had not filed any proxy.

The 12th to 23rd Defendants–Respondents–Respondents–Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the 12th to 23rd Defendants–Respondents)

subsequently intervened in the action.

After the preliminary plan and its corresponding report were received, and

upon completion of other preliminary steps, the case was fixed for trial. The

trial was postponed on several occasions, and when the case was eventually

taken up for trial, only the Plaintiff–Appellant and the 22nd Defendant–

Respondent were present. The evidence of the Plaintiff–Appellant was led, and

thereafter, the learned District Judge delivered judgment on 20th February 2002,

based solely on the evidence of the Plaintiff–Appellant.

In his judgment, the learned District Judge allotted a 1/12 share to the Plaintiff–

Appellant and 1/12 shares each to the 8th and 9th Defendants–Respondents.

Although he found that the 1st Defendant–Respondent was entitled to 2/12

shares, the 2nd to 7th Defendants–Respondents to 3/12 shares, and the 10th and

11th Defendants–Respondents to 3/12 shares, such shares were not allotted as

the title deeds establishing devolution of title had not been tendered to Court. A

further undivided 1/2 share remained unallotted on the basis that no evidence

had been led in respect of that portion.

The interlocutory decree was tendered in the first instance, and accordingly, a

commission was issued for the preparation of the final scheme. In executing the

commission, it was found that the interlocutory decree did not contain a

specific direction regarding the entitlement to the plantation. Consequently, the

Court made a further order declaring the entitlement to the plantation in

accordance with the surveyor’s report attached to the preliminary plan. The

interlocutory decree was thereafter amended accordingly.

The undivided 3/12 share had been left unallotted in respect of the claim of the

2nd to 7th Defendants–Respondents due to their failure to tender the title deed

12

bearing No. 1118. The 3rd Defendant–Respondent, who is a child of the 2nd

Defendant–Respondent and a sibling of the 4th to 7th Defendants–Respondents,

thereafter made an application to have that share allotted to the 2nd to 7th

Defendants–Respondents, which application was allowed by Court.

Accordingly, the interlocutory decree was once again amended.

Finally, the Court Commissioner tendered the final partition scheme bearing

No. 1150. The 4th to 6th Defendants–Respondents thereafter made applications,

stating that their Attorney-at-Law, Mr. Gafoor, had assumed office as a judicial

officer, which rendered their proxy defective, and that they had not been

informed of this fact. They further contended that they had been advised that

the corpus had not been properly identified and that the action was likely to be

dismissed. Acting on this legal advice, they had refrained from attending

Court1.

The learned District Judge, having considered the said applications, correctly

dismissed them on the ground that the applicants had no locus standi to make

such an application. The learned District Judge had rightly taken into account

Sections 48(1) and 48(4) of the Partition Law and held that the 4th to 6th

Defendants–Respondents could not invoke the mechanism provided under

Section 48(4) of the said Law, as they had not tendered statements of claim.

Accordingly, their respective applications were dismissed.

Thereafter, the 4th to 6th Defendants–Respondents sought to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial Civil Appellate High Court of

Gampaha, seeking to set aside the entire proceedings from 12th October 1997

on the ground that they were not informed of their Attorney-at-Law, Mr.

Gafoor, assuming judicial office, which rendered their proxy defective. The

learned Judges of the High Court, upon revision, set aside the proceedings from

the point at which Mr. Gafoor assumed judicial duties, holding that the record

had thereby become defective. They further held that the case could not

1 Vide Petition dated August 23, 2015 submitted to the District Court by the 6th Defendant at Page 746 of

brief of the Civil Appellate High Court

13

proceed without giving notice to the 4th to 7th Defendants–Respondents

regarding the defective proxy.

Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Plaintiff–Appellant moved this Court

seeking leave to appeal against the order of the High Court of Civil Appellate,

and this Court granted leave on the following questions of law.

25. (c) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court

erroneously consider there was miscarriage of justice has been caused

to 4th to 6th Defendant-Respondents as their case was not prosecuted due

to their Registered Attorney ceased to practice since 1987 which is a

deliberate falsehood as they who have appointed the Registered

Attorney should inquire about the proceedings of the case by showing

due diligence as they are living in the corpus, according to the

averments in their petition?

(d) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court totally

disregard the order of the learned Additional District Judge who has

clearly held that 4th to 6th Defendant-Respondents have no legal right

and particularly they do not come under section 48 (4) (a) (i) and 48 (a)

(iv) of the Partition Act and the Registered Attorney accepting a

Judicial appointment and his failure to inform his clients his difficulty to

appear for them is not a ground to challenge the interlocutory decree

entered under section 48 of the Partition Act.

(e) Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court fail to

consider that after the interlocutory decree is entered in a partition case

the Defendants-Respondents have no legal right to move in the District

Court to set aside the judgment and the interlocutory decree after 13

years and they also have no legal right to challenge the dismissal of

their petition by way of revision without any exceptional circumstances

and after an inordinate delay?

(f) Has a grave and irreparable injustice been caused to the Plaintiff-

Petitioner and other Defendant-Respondents who did not challenge the

pedigree or other steps taken in the case up to the consideration of the

14

final plan and as a result of this illegal and perverse order made by

their Lordships' of the Civil Appellate High Court the Plaintiff-

Petitioner has to proceed with this case from the preliminary steps of

even calling for statements of claim?

Does a proxy become invalid upon the appointment of the Registered

Attorney to a judicial office?

In addressing this issue, it is pertinent to examine the duties and responsibilities

of a registered Attorney upon ceasing to practice. Rule No. 23 of the Supreme

Court (Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law) Rules, 1988 provides

that:

"An Attorney-at-Law in the event of his ceasing to practice his

profession is under a duty to give his client or clients reasonable

notice of such cessation”.

When a registered Attorney who represents a client joins the judiciary, it results

in a premature termination of the professional relationship between the

Attorney-at-Law and the client. Such instances also fall within the category of

“cessation of profession” under Rule No. 23. In such cases, the registered

Attorney ceases to represent the client before the Court upon assuming duties

as a judicial officer. The duties of an Attorney-at-Law in such circumstances

were aptly explained by the late Supreme Court Justice A.R.B. Amerasinghe as

follows:

"A premature termination of the relationship may also take place if

the attorney ceases to practice his profession, e. g. because he

accepts judicial office or joins the state service or undertakes other

employments, or because he is suspended (...). Where he has ceased

to practice, the attorney is obliged by SL Rule 23 to give

reasonable notice of the cessation of the practice of his

profession(...).

(...) No hard and fast rules can be laid down as to what will

constitute reasonable notice prior to withdrawal general, an

15

attorney should protect the client's interests as far as possible and

should not desert the client at a critical stage of a matter when the

withdrawal would put the client in a position of disadvantage or

peril."2 [Emphasis added.]

The learned Counsel for the 12A Defendant–Respondent and the 4th to 7th

Defendants–Respondents drew our attention to another relevant provision,

namely Section 27(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, which reads as follows:

“27 (1) (…)

(2) When so filed, it shall be in force until revoked with the

leave of the court and after notice to the Registered Attorney

by a writing signed by the client and filed in court, or until the

client dies, or until the Registered Attorney dies, is removed, or

suspended, or otherwise becomes incapable to act, or until all

proceedings in the action are ended and judgment satisfied so

far as regards the client”

The words “otherwise becomes incapable to act” signify an incapacity to

represent a client. Therefore, a plain reading of the section indicates that an

Attorney-at-Law assuming a government or judicial office amounts to being

incapable of continuing to serve the client.

What occurs if a registered Attorney dies or otherwise becomes incapable of

acting on behalf of a client? Section 28 of the Civil Procedure Code prescribes

the procedure to be followed. It reads as follows:

28. “If any such Registered Attorney as in the last preceding section is

mentioned shall die, or be removed or suspended, or otherwise become

incapable to act as aforesaid, at any time before judgment, no further

proceeding shall be taken in the action against the party for whom he

appeared until thirty days after notice to appoint another Registered

2Professional Ethics and Responsibilities of Lawyers, A.R.B. Amerasinghe, at Page 468 and 469.

16

Attorney has been given to that party either personally or in such other

manner as the court directs.”

A plain reading of Section 28 of the Civil Procedure Code makes it incumbent

upon the Court to serve notice on a party whose Attorney-at-Law is deceased

or otherwise incapable of acting on the party’s behalf. However, it is unrealistic

to expect the Courts to monitor the professional status of every Attorney-at-

Law or the precise time at which they cease to practice. Consequently,

whenever an Attorney-at-Law reaches a stage where he is unable to continue

his practice for any reason, it is his primary duty to inform his clients that he

will no longer appear on their behalf.

In the instant case, as the subject Attorney has joined the judiciary, he cannot,

unlike in the event of death, exempt himself from the responsibility of

informing his clients of his new professional status. Thereafter, it becomes the

responsibility of the parties to notify the Court regarding the cessation of their

Attorney’s practice. The Court cannot, in any manner, be held liable for acts or

omissions caused by the parties or their respective Attorneys-at-Law. I am

compelled to disagree with the view expressed by the learned High Court

Judges in this regard.

Furthermore, in a partition action, every party is required to tender and register

their address to receive notice of the trial. However, when a registered Attorney

is appointed, the address provided in the proxy is deemed to be the registered

address of that party. Section 19(3)(b) of the Partition Law specifically

provides that:

19 (1)-(2) (…)

(3)(a)(…)

(3)(b) “Where a party to a partition action appears by a Registered

Attorney the address of the Registered Attorney contained in the proxy

shall be deemed to be the registered address of such party. And such

Registered Attorney shall on or before the date or later date referred to

17

in subsection (1) of this section, tender to the Registrar stamps to cover

the cost of postage by registered post of the notice under section 24.”

(c)-(d) (…)”

Hence, if an Attorney-at-Law tenders a proxy for a party, and the party opts to

be represented by an Attorney-at-Law, the validity of the proxy is an essential

requirement for the case to proceed. The learned Counsel for the 4A, 5A, and

6A Defendants–Respondents have cited the judgments in Kandiah vs

Vairamuttu3 (S.C.), Seelawathie and Another vs Jayasinghe4 (C.A.), and

Manapei Somawathie vs Buwaneswari5 (C.A.), where it was held that a party

who has filed a proxy cannot perform an act in person without revoking or

terminating the proxy. We agree with the principle laid down in these

judgments.

In Kandiah vs Vairamuttu (supra), the Plaintiffs–Appellants, who were the

judgment creditors, after the issuance of the writ of execution, informed the

Court personally that the full amount of the decree, with interest and costs, had

been received by them. However, the District Judge ordered that the Plaintiffs–

Appellants must make a proper representation through their proctor. Basnayake

J. observed at page 2:"It is well established that once a proxy is given to a

proctor the party himself cannot without revoking the proxy legally perform in

person any act in Court." In Seelawathie and Another vs Jayasinghe (supra),

the case involved a party who, while having a registered Attorney-at-Law on

record, had tendered a notice of appeal personally. The Court of Appeal

dismissed the appeal on the ground that the notice of appeal was defective,

having been filed by the party himself. At page 270, the Court of Appeal

observed: “When a party has an attorney at law on record, it is the attorney at

law on record alone who must take steps and also whom the Court permits to

take steps.”

5 [1990] 1 Sri LR 223.

18

Even Section 29(1) of the Civil Procedure Code provides that a process served

at the address furnished by a registered Attorney is deemed to be served on the

party. It reads as follows:

“

29 (1). Any process served on the registered attorney of any party or

left at the office or ordinary residence of such registered attorney,

relative to an action or appeal, except where the same is for the

personal appearance of the party, shall be presumed to be duly

communicated and made known to the party whom the registered

attorney represents; and, unless the court otherwise directs, shall

be as effectual for all purposes in relation to the action or appeal

as if the same had been given to, or served on, the party in person.

(2)– (3) (…)”

It is frequently observed that partition cases continue to proceed despite the

death of a party going unnoticed, particularly where the Attorneys-at-Law

representing the parties are themselves unaware of the death. This situation

occurs more often when a single Attorney-at-Law appears on behalf of multiple

parties.

The issue then arises as to who is responsible for informing the Court of a

party’s death. In Dharmaratane Thero vs Siyadoris and Others6 (C.A.), the

Plaintiff instituted an action for the partition of a land called “Udukumbura”,

measuring 2 Acres, 3 Roods, and 37 Perches. The land was surveyed by the

Court Commissioner on 16th January 1965. In the statement of claims, the 62nd

Defendant contended that the corpus formed part of a larger land called

“Halgahawatta”, measuring 29 Acres, 3 Roods, and 6 Perches. The larger land

was surveyed and superimposed on the preliminary plan.

When the case was taken up for trial on 11th January 1978, with 275 parties on

record, an application was made to register lis pendens in respect of the larger

6 [1985] 2 Sri LR 245.

19

land. The District Court rejected the application on the ground that allowing it

would effectively recommence the case after a lapse of 28 years, and it would

take a further 50 years to conclude. The Court of Appeal was then confronted

with Section 19(2)(b) of the Partition Law, which reads:

“Where any defendant seeks to have a larger land made the subject-

matter of the action as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the

court shall specify the party to the action by whom and the date on or

before which an application for the registration of the action as a lis

pendens affecting such larger land shall be filed in court, and the

estimated costs of survey of such larger land as determined by court shall

be deposited in court”

The words that came under the scrutiny of the Court of Appeal were: “…the

court shall specify the party…,” which, similar to Section 28 of the Civil

Procedure Code, imposes a mandatory duty on the Court to make an order for

the registration of lis pendens and to issue a commission. His Lordship Justice

G.P.S. de Silva observed at page 247:

“It would appear that on a literal reading of the section, the duty is cast

on the court to specify the party by whom an application for the

registration of the action as a lis pendens in respect of the larger land has

to be filed. But the relevant question is, at what point of time does such

duty arise? It seems to me that the duty of the court arises only upon the

party defendant interested in having the larger land partitioned moving

the court to make the appropriate order in terms of the section. This is a

matter which would normally dome up in the course of the motion roll and

it was surely the duty of the Attorney-at-Law representing the petitioner to

have invited the court to make the required order. How else is the court to

be made aware of the need to make an order in terms of section 19 (2)

(b)? The interpretation contended for on behalf of the petitioner would

place an undue burden on the Court.”

20

The word “shall” have, on certain occasions, been interpreted to mean “may”

(Hewawasam Gamage vs Minister of Agriculture7, S.C.). Accordingly, the

Court of Appeal in Dharmaratane Thero’s case adopted a practical approach

to the issue before it. How could the Court be expected to ascertain whether all

parties and Attorneys-at-Law are alive or deceased? Similarly, how could the

Court determine whether an Attorney-at-Law has ceased to practice? In such

circumstances, should the Court be burdened with inquiring into the capability

of each Attorney-at-Law to represent their client? I am of the view that the

Court should not be saddled with a responsibility that cannot be practically

discharged.

I am mindful that all judicial appointments are published in the Government

Gazette, of which the Court may take judicial notice. However, in practical

terms, such judicial notice can only be taken into account once the relevant

party draws the Court’s attention to the publication.

Therefore, I am of the view that the word “shall” in Section 28 should be

interpreted as “may,” and that it is the duty of the party or parties to inform the

Court of the termination of a proxy. The Court should not be burdened with

such a responsibility.

If the 4th to 6th Defendants–Respondents had any genuine interest in pursuing

their claims, they should have consulted their respective Attorneys-at-Law and

should not have waited, since 1987, for well over 25 years to ascertain the

status of their case. The excuse advanced in the petitions of the 5th and 6th

Defendants–Respondents before the District Court was that they had received

legal advice regarding a defect in the identification of the corpus in the

preliminary plan, and that, as a result, the action would be dismissed.

The commission was executed and returned to Court on 17th December 1998,

as recorded in Journal Entry No. 18. If Mr. Gafoor assumed judicial office on

12th October 1997, and it was he who allegedly advised the Defendants–

Respondents of the defect in the identification of the corpus, it is, in my view,

not his assumption of judicial office that left the 4th to 6th Defendants–

Respondents uninformed. Furthermore, the 3rd Defendant–Respondent had

made an application after the judgment to have the unallotted shares allotted to

him and to all his siblings, namely the 2nd and 4th to 7th Defendants–

Respondents. Accordingly, it appears that even if it is assumed that there was a

defect in the record arising from the failure to notify the 4th to 6th Defendants–

Respondents of their Registered Attorney’s assumption of judicial office, such

a defect, by itself, did not cause any prejudice to the 4th to 7th Defendants–

Respondents.

In particular, Section 48(1) of the Partition Law renders an interlocutory decree

final and conclusive, notwithstanding any defect in procedure. It reads as

follows:

48(1) Save as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the interlocutory

decree entered under section 26 and the final decree of partition entered

under section 36 shall, subject to the decision on any appeal which may

be preferred therefrom, and in the case of an interlocutory decree,

subject also to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, be good

and sufficient evidence of the title of any person as to any right, share or

interest awarded therein to him and be final and conclusive for all

purposes against all persons whomsoever, whatever rights title or

interest they have, or claim to have to or in the land to which such decree

relates and notwithstanding any omission or defect of procedure or in the

proof of title adduced before the court or the fact that all persons

concerned are not parties to the partition action; and the right, share or

interest awarded by any such decree shall be free from all encumbrances

whatsoever other than those specified in that decree.

In this subsection "omission or defect of procedure " shall include an

omission or failure-

(a) to serve summons on any party; or

22

(b) to substitute the heirs or legal representatives of a party who dies

pending the action or to appoint a person to represent the estate of

the deceased party for the purposes of the action; or

(c) to appoint a guardian ad litem of a party who is a minor or a

person of unsound mind.

(2)-(7) (…)”

Therefore, I am of the view that the failure to notify the 4th to 6th Defendants–

Respondents of their Registered Attorney’s assumption of judicial office does

not render the entire proceedings of the case defective.

Miscarriage of Justice

The complaint of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Defendants–Respondents is that a grave

miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the Court’s failure to inform them of

their Attorney-at-Law’s inability to represent them. It is well-settled law that

the revisionary jurisdiction of an Appellate Court may be exercised to prevent a

miscarriage of justice (Soysa vs Silva and Others8, (C.A.); Caroline Nona and

Others vs Pedrick Singho and Others9, (C.A.); and Attorney-General vs

Gunawardena10, (S.C.).

However, the concept of a miscarriage of justice must be considered in a

relative context; it cannot be assessed solely from the perspective of the

Appellant. As noted above, it does not appear to me that any serious

miscarriage of justice occurred as far as the 4th to 6th Defendants–Respondents

are concerned. In fact, the 3rd Defendant–Respondent, acting on their behalf,

9[2005] 3 Sri LR 176.

10[1996] 2 Sri LR 149.

23

applied to the Court and secured the allotment of their unallotted shares. While

it is true that the 3rd Defendant–Respondent is independent of the 4th to 6th

Defendants–Respondents, this fact is nonetheless relevant in evaluating their

claim of a miscarriage of justice. Moreover, they had refrained from attending

Court based on erroneous legal advice that the action would fail due to a failure

to identify the corpus. If they acted on such advice, it is they themselves who

must bear the consequences.

If the judgment and the amended interlocutory decree were set aside and the

case were to recommence from the stage of filing statements of claim, the

Plaintiff–Appellant and the other Defendants–Respondents who have already

obtained their shares would suffer further prejudice due to the delay. In my

view, such damage cannot be remedied merely by an award of costs. Moreover,

the 4th to 6th Defendants–Respondents should not be granted relief arising from

their own negligence. The well-known Latin maxim, “Vigilantibus Non

Dormientibus Jura Subveniunt”, that the law assists those who are vigilant, not

those who sleep over their rights (Gunasekera and Another vs Abdul Latiff11),

(C.A.) is particularly applicable in this context.

Judgment in Somawathie vs Madawela and Others

Both learned Counsel have drawn attention to the judgment in Somawathie vs

Madawela and Others12 (S.C.), where Soza J. took into consideration Section

48(3), which preserves the revisionary jurisdiction of the Appellate Court.

However, it appears to me that the facts in Somawathie vs Madawela and

Others (supra) are not applicable to the present case. It is correct that

subsection (3) of Section 48 of the Partition Law specifically reserves the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Appellate Court. Nevertheless, this does not

mean that a party who has been entirely negligent should be permitted to

invoke the Appellate Court’s revisionary jurisdiction to set aside all

proceedings.

24

On the other hand, when considering the application of the 4th to 6th

Defendants–Respondents, it does not appear that they have suffered any

prejudice as a result of the judgment. Although they contend that the corpus

was not properly identified, there is no allegation that the land depicted in the

preliminary plan is different. The title upheld in the judgment is not disputed.

Their complaint is essentially that they were deprived of a portion of the land to

which they were entitled. It was open to them to file statements of objection to

the scheme of partition in the District Court, rather than seeking to have the

entire proceedings set aside.

The entitlement of the 4th to 6th Defendants-Respondents to invoke the

procedure provided under Section 48 (4) of the Partition Law.

It was urged that the learned District Judge erred in rejecting the application

made to the District Court by the 4th to 6th Defendants–Respondents. The

learned District Judge based his order on the ground that the 4th to 6th

Defendants–Respondents could not invoke the mechanism provided under

Section 48(4) of the Partition Law, as they had failed to file statements of

claim. On a plain reading of the statutory provision in Section 48(4)(a), only a

Defendant who has filed a statement of claim but failed to participate at the

trial is entitled to make an application to the Court. It reads as follows:

“(a) Whenever a party to a partition action-

(i) has not been served with summons, or

(ii) being a minor or a person of unsound mind, has not been

duly represented by a guardian ad litem, or

(iii) dies before judgment Is entered and no substitution of his

heirs or legal representatives has been made or no person, has

been appointed to represent the estate of the deceased party

for the purpose of the action, or

(iv) being a party who has duly filed his statement of clime and

registered has address, fails to appeal at the trial………”

25

The relevant provision in the context of this case is subsection (a) (iv), as

subsections (i), (ii), and (iii) of the same section apply to situations where

either summons have not been served, a guardian ad litem has not been

appointed, or no substitution has taken place in the case of a deceased

Defendant–Respondent. The mechanism in subsection (iv) can be invoked only

if the Defendant has filed a valid statement of claim. Accordingly, the learned

District Judge rightly dismissed the applications of the 4th to 6th Defendants–

Respondents on the basis that they do not fall within the scope of the said

statutory provision.

Conclusion

For the reasons set out above, all questions of law are answered in the

affirmative. The judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court is accordingly set

aside, and the case is remitted to the High Court of Civil Appellate of

Gampaha, to be sent back to the District Court of Gampaha to enter the final

decree after considering the final scheme, and thereafter to proceed with the

consequential steps.

The Plaintiff–Appellant, along with the 1a and 12a Defendants–Respondents,

are entitled to recover the costs of this application from the 5a, 6a, 6b, and 6c

Defendants–Respondents.
