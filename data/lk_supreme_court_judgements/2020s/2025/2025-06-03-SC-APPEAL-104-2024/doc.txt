Background facts

The treasury bond scam of 2015–2016, involving grave irregularities in the

issuance of treasury bonds at auctions conducted by the Central Bank of

3

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

Sri Lanka between 01.02.2015 and 31.03.2016, is widely regarded as the

most serious financial scandal in the history of the country. The resultant

economic loss to the Government and the public is estimated to run into

several billions of rupees, thereby causing substantial harm to the national

economy and public trust in financial governance. These events triggered a

widespread public outcry.

On the one hand, pursuant to a written complaint made by the then

Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, on 25.11.2016,

the Criminal Investigation Department of the Sri Lanka Police commenced

a criminal investigation. On the other hand, given the magnitude and

complexity of the issue, the then President of the Republic appointed a

Presidential Commission of Inquiry under section 2 of the Commissions of

Inquiry Act, No. 17 of 1948, as amended, comprising two sitting Judges of

the Supreme Court and a retired Deputy Auditor General, with a mandate

to investigate, inquire into, and report on the issuance of treasury bonds

during the relevant period. The final report of the Commission (P4) was

handed over to the President on 30.12.2017 and has since remained in the

public domain. The President, inter alia, referred the final report to the

Attorney General for advice and appropriate action.

Initially, the Criminal Investigation Department reported facts to the

Magistrate’s Court of Fort in Case No. B/16089/2020, implicating several

individuals as suspects, including the Minister of Finance at the material

time, namely Ravi Karunanayake. Ravi Karunanayake succeeded in

obtaining a writ of certiorari from the Court of Appeal quashing the arrest

warrant issued against him by the Fort Magistrate’s Court, in a separate

writ application.

Thereafter, the Attorney General, under his hand, exhibited information

dated 11.02.2021 to the High Court of Colombo (P10), comprising 26 typed

pages, in terms of section 450(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.

4

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

15 of 1979. This document set out a summary of the investigation, including

the names of 11 suspects and the alleged offences attributed to them. The

Attorney General also transmitted the indictment to the High Court

containing 32 counts wherein Ravi Karunanayake is named as the 2nd

accused.

Section 450(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Code or any other law,

the Attorney-General may exhibit to the High Court information in

respect of any offence to be tried before the High Court at Bar by three

Judges without a jury.

It is significant to note that in this information exhibited by the Attorney

General, the Attorney General made it very clear that the said information

and the indictment were based upon:

(a) the investigation conducted by the Criminal Investigation

Department pursuant to the complaint made by Dr. Indrajit

Coomaraswamy; and

(b) the material collected in the course of the inquiry conducted by the

Presidential Commission of Inquiry.

Let me quote the introductory part of the information exhibited by the

Attorney General to the High Court, which clearly identifies the sources of

information:

It would not be inaccurate to make the observation that the modus operandi

and the complex nature of the offences alleged to have been committed by

the accused transcend the comprehension of an Attorney-at-Law and a

Judge engaged in routine criminal matters in the ordinary course of duty.

Section 450(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:

Where the Chief Justice is of the opinion that owing to the nature of the

offence or the circumstances of and relating to the commission of the

6

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

offence, in the interests of justice a trial at Bar should be held, the Chief

Justice may by order under his hand direct that the trial of any person

for that offence shall be held before the High Court at Bar by three

Judges without a jury.

Recognising the gravity of the offences and the circumstances under which

they were alleged to have been committed, the Chief Justice, by order dated

18.02.2021, acting under section 450(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, appointed a High Court at Bar by nominating three High Court Judges

to hear and determine this special case without a jury.

While the case was pending before the High Court at Bar, Ravi

Karunanayake (hereinafter referred to as “the petitioner”), invoked the writ

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal on 01.10.2021, naming the Attorney

General, the Registrar of the High Court at Bar, and the Commissioners of

the Presidential Commission of Inquiry as respondents, seeking to quash,

by way of a writ of certiorari:

(a) the decision and the indictment and/or information filed/exhibited

against the petitioner by the Attorney General; and

(b) the following “decisions” made in the report of the Commission of

Inquiry against the petitioner [as identified by the petitioner in

paragraph (g) of the prayer to the petition], namely:

(i) that the petitioner gave assurances/undertakings at a meeting

held on 28.03.2016 at the Ministry of Finance as aforesaid [i.e.

that the petitioner instructed the representatives of the three

state banks to only bid within specified yield rates given by the

petitioner at the treasury bond auction to be held on 29.03.2016,

and also assured them that only bids within that range would be

accepted by the Central Bank at the auction]; and/or

(ii) that the petitioner should have advised the Central Bank of Sri

Lanka of such alleged assurances/undertakings; and/or

7

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

(iii) that the petitioner ought to have taken steps to ensure that the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka honoured such assurances/

undertakings; and/or

(iv) that instructions to state banks to bid at low yield rates resulted

in restricted bids for state banks resulting in other primary

dealers [particularly, the 1st accused, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.,

who allegedly used “inside information” and “market

manipulation”] having an increased opportunity to have their

bids accepted at the auction held on 29.03.2016.

By its judgment dated 28.02.2023, the Court of Appeal quashed, by way of

certiorari, the information exhibited and the indictment filed against the

petitioner by the Attorney General, but refused to quash the decisions of

the Commission of Inquiry identified in paragraph (g) of the prayer to the

petition. It is against this judgment that the Attorney General filed the

present appeal with leave obtained. Notwithstanding the refusal to quash

the aforesaid decisions of the Commission of Inquiry, the petitioner did not

prefer an appeal. Accordingly, the only question that remains for

determination in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal was correct in

quashing the information exhibited and indictment filed against the

petitioner by way of certiorari.

Why was the indictment quashed?

Let me now consider the basis on which the Court of Appeal quashed the

information exhibited and the indictment filed against the petitioner by way

of certiorari. I must state at the outset that the reasoning of the Court of

Appeal is not easily discernible, perhaps due to the inherently complex

nature of the application presented by the petitioner before the Court of

Appeal in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction. However, I will endeavour to

distil and set them out in some logical sequence.

The High Court at Bar, in a previous order, took the view that count 1,

based on the Public Property Act, could not be maintained against a juristic

person, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., the 1st accused in the indictment.

However, it appears that the appeal filed by the Attorney General against

that order is pending before the Supreme Court.

I must state at the outset that charges 1, 3, 14, 15, and 16 of the indictment

are directly or indirectly related to the decisions or findings made by the

Commission of Inquiry, as enumerated by the petitioner in paragraph (g) of

the prayer to the petition, quoted above. It is the petitioner himself who

characterised those items set out in paragraph (g) as “decisions” made by

the Commission of Inquiry in its final report. However, the Court of Appeal

appears to have been reluctant to identify them as “decisions”, and instead

preferred to characterise them as “assertions”. This is evident from several

observations and findings made in its judgment, including the following:

“Hence, I am not inclined to accept the propositions of the Petitioner that the

11

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

Commission of Inquiry has acted in violation of rules of Natural Justice,

particularly in respect of the impugned assertions reflected in paragraph (g)

of the prayer of the Petition.” Towards the end of its judgment, the Court of

Appeal identifies them as “assertions or observations.” The petitioner

identifies them as “decisions”. The Court of Appeal identifies them as

“assertions”. I might identify them as “findings”.

Whatever the label one may use, the Commission of Inquiry expressed such

views in the final report. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for

learned President’s Counsel for the petitioner to have identified them as

“decisions” and sought to quash them by way of certiorari. Once the Court

of Appeal refused to quash those decisions/assertions/findings/views of

the Commission of Inquiry, they remain valid.

The Attorney General is entitled to rely on the material collected in the

course of the Commission of Inquiry in formulating charges against the

petitioner, in terms of section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act.

In that backdrop, the Court of Appeal could have dismissed the writ

application allowing the Trial Court to determine those pure questions of

fact at the trial. Such a course of action would not have prejudiced the rights

of the petitioner, as he would have had the opportunity during the trial to

challenge those facts and present his defence.

In discussing the boundaries of judicial review, Administrative Law by Sir

William Wade and Christopher Forsyth, 11th Edition, page 533, citing in

particular R v. DPP, ex parte Kebelene [1999] 3 WLR 972, states that “The

House of Lords has however held that decisions about prosecutions are not

amenable to judicial review where the complaint could equally well be made

in the course of trial, since otherwise trials would be unacceptably delayed

by collateral proceedings.” This is precisely what has happened in the

instant case. The House of Lords in that case affirmed the broad discretion

12

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

vested in the Director of Public Prosecutions in consenting to prosecutions

and recognised that judicial review would only be warranted in instances of

dishonesty, bad faith, or other exceptional circumstances. In the present

case, there is no allegation that the Attorney General acted in bad faith or

has abused his position.

Section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act reads as follows:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 or any other law, it shall be lawful for

the Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings in a court of law

in respect of any offence, based on material collected in the course of

an investigation or inquiry or both an investigation and inquiry, as the

case may be, by a Commission of Inquiry appointed under this Act.

The term “material” has not been defined in the Act, but in the Sinhala text

of the Act it is expressed as “කතොරුරු”, which suggests that the word is to be

understood broadly, not narrowly.

Section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act has previously been

interpreted by Wengappuli J. in the Court of Appeal in Punchihewa v. The

Officer in Charge, Financial Investigation Unit III and Others

(CA/WRIT/311/2019, CA Minutes of 18.06.2020 at 17-18) as follows:

Plain reading of this section indicates that it empowers the 6th

Respondent to institute criminal proceedings based “on material

collected in the course of an investigation and or inquiry or both an

investigation and inquiry…” by a Commission of Inquiry appointed

under the said Act, in order to override the mandatory provision

contained in Section 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The said

Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act imposes a mandatory duty

that all offences, unless otherwise specially provided for, shall be

investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise be dealt with the

13

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

provisions of that Code. It also imposes the condition that the

investigations should be conducted either by the police or by an

“inquirer” recognized by the Code. With this amendment to the

Commissions of Inquiry Act, the 6th Respondent could consider “material

collected in the course of an investigation and or inquiry or both an

investigation and inquiry” by that Commission.

The intention of the Legislature in this regard is clearly reflected in the

wording found in the Section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act as it

is stated that “notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 or any other law, it shall be

lawful for the Attorney-General to institute criminal proceedings in a

court of law in respect of any offence, …”

The Court of Appeal in the instant case took the view that “the Attorney

General also should be satisfied, based on whatever material collected, that

an offence has been committed”, but found that the Attorney General had

failed to satisfy the Court that there was “adequate material and evidence”

against the petitioner to justify indicting him in the High Court at Bar.

I concur with the view that the Attorney General should not, without careful

scrutiny, adopt the material collected in the course of an investigation or

inquiry conducted by a Commission of Inquiry appointed under the

Commissions of Inquiry Act when deciding whether or not to indict a

person. The Attorney General is required to give due consideration to such

material. Nevertheless, the decision to indict must be made by the Attorney

General independently and upon a careful evaluation of the available

evidence. However, on the facts and circumstances of this case, the Court

of Appeal overstepped the boundaries of its writ jurisdiction when it

quashed the indictment against the petitioner on the ground that there was

insufficient material and evidence.

14

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

Prosecutorial discretion

The Attorney General performs a vital role in the administration of justice.

As the principal legal officer of the State, the Attorney General occupies a

unique position, entrusted inter alia with the responsibility of ensuring that

the criminal justice process is carried out fairly, impartially, and in strict

conformity with the law. In discharging that responsibility, the Attorney

General exercises what is widely termed as “prosecutorial discretion”.

In Law Society of Alberta v. Craig Charles Krieger and the Minister of Justice

and Attorney General for Alberta [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372 at 395, the Supreme

Court of Canada aptly summarised the concept of prosecutorial discretion

in the following terms: “Significantly, what is common to the various elements

of prosecutorial discretion is that they involve the ultimate decisions as to

whether a prosecution should be brought, continued or ceased, and what the

prosecution ought to be for.”

The wide powers exercised by the Attorney General are delineated inter alia

in sections 393 to 401 of Chapter XXXIII of our Code of Criminal Procedure

Act. I do not intend to reproduce all those provisions found in the Act but

will set out below only a part of section 393 to understand the nature of

discretion the Attorney General enjoys:

393(1) It shall be lawful for the Attorney-General to exhibit information,

present indictments and to institute, undertake, or carry on criminal

proceedings in the following cases, that is to say—

(a) in the case of any offence where a preliminary inquiry under

Chapter XV by a Magistrate is imperative or may be directed to be

held by the Attorney-General;

(b) in any case where the offence is not bailable;

(c) in any case referred to him by a State Department in which he

considers that criminal proceedings should be instituted;

15

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

(d) in any case other than one filed under section 136(1)(a) of this Code

which appears to him to be of importance or difficulty or which for

any other reason requires his intervention;

(e) in any case where an indictment is presented or information

exhibited in the High Court by him.

(2) The Attorney-General shall give advice, whether on application or

on his own initiative to State Departments, public officers, officers of

the police and officers in corporations in any criminal matter of

importance or difficulty.

(3) The Attorney-General shall be entitled to summon any officer of the

State or of a corporation or of the police to attend his office with any

books or documents and there interview him for the purpose of—

(a) initiating or prosecuting any criminal proceeding, or

(b) giving advice in any criminal matter of importance or difficulty.

The officer concerned shall comply with such summons and attend at

the office of the Attorney-General with such books and documents as

he may have been summoned to bring.

The discretion which may be lawfully exercised by the Attorney General

applies not only to the commencement of prosecutions, but also to the

discontinuance thereof. In terms of section 194(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, at any stage of a trial before the High Court and before the

return of the verdict, the Attorney-General can inform the Court that he will

not further prosecute the accused upon the indictment or any charge

therein. Upon such information, the accused shall be discharged therefrom.

As section 401 indicates, the Attorney General has the power to enter a nolle

prosequi, thereby halting any prosecution pending before any Court. The

Attorney General can also tender a pardon to an accomplice.

16

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

These examples underscore the breadth of the Attorney General’s

prosecutorial discretion and the confidence reposed in his office by the law,

with a view to ensuring the effective administration of justice.

In the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, the Attorney General is required

to act independently and free from extraneous influence or political

pressure. This discretion is not merely administrative in nature but is

quasi-judicial, involving the careful assessment of material to determine the

important question as to whether a prosecution is warranted.

Once an indictment is presented, the Attorney General should continue to

uphold the same standards of independence and objectivity throughout the

trial. In The Attorney General v. Sivapragasam (1959) 60 NLR 468 at 471,

Sansoni J. stated:

I have not seen the duties and responsibilities of prosecuting counsel

set out better than in an article written by Mr. Christmas Humphreys

Q.C. when he was Senior Prosecuting Counsel, Central Criminal Court

[1 Criminal Law Review (1955) page 739]. His view, and it is one with

which I respectfully agree, is that “the prosecutor is at all times a

minister of justice, though seldom so described. It is not the duty of

prosecuting counsel to secure a conviction, nor should any prosecutor

feel pride or satisfaction in the mere fact of success… His attitude

should be so objective that he is, so far as is humanly possible,

indifferent to the result”.

In the recent Privy Council case of Director of Public Prosecutions (Appellant)

v. Chris Durham and Two Others (Trinidad and Tobago) [2024] UKPC 21 at

paragraph 41, Lady Carr stated:

The prosecutor acts independently of those responsible for

investigation. Nor is it the prosecutor’s duty to secure a conviction, but

rather the duty is to act as a minister of justice (see for example Randall

17

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

v The Queen [2002] UKPC 19; [2002] 1 WLR 2237 (“Randall”), para

10(i)). The role thus excludes any notion of winning or losing.

As Samarakoon C.J. stated in Land Reform Commission v. Grand Central

Ltd. [1981] 1 Sri LR 250 at 261:

The Attorney-General of his Country is the leader of the Bar and the

highest Legal Officer of the State. As Attorney-General he has a duty

to Court, to the State and to the subject to be wholly detached, wholly

independent and to act impartially with the sole object of establishing

the truth. It is for that reason that all Courts in this Island request the

appearance of the Attorney General as amicus curiae when the Court

requires assistance, which assistance has in the past been readily

given.

In Centre for Environmental Justice (Guarantee Limited) and Others v.

Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, and Urban

Development and Economic Policies and Implementation and Others [2021] 2

Sri LR 33 at 38, Janak de Silva J. stated:

The Attorney-General is vested with extensive statutory powers in

relation to criminal investigations and prosecutions. Such powers are

held in public trust. They must be exercised for the due administration

of justice according to the rule of law which is the basis of our

Constitution. Any type of dictation from whatever quarter will

compromise the independence of the Attorney-General unless such

dictation is permitted by law. Any compromise of the independence of

the Attorney-General will have a negative impact on the rule of law.

Monnin C.J., delivering the judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Re

Balderstone v. The Queen (1983) 4 DLR (4th) 162 at 169 observed:

18

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

The judicial and the executive must not mix. These are two separate

and distinct functions. The accusatorial officers lay information or in

some cases prefer indictments. Courts or the curia listen to cases

brought to their attention and decide them on their merits or on

meritorious preliminary matters. If a judge should attempt to review the

actions or conduct of the Attorney-General—barring flagrant

impropriety—he could be falling into a field which is not his and

interfering with the administrative and accusatorial function of the

Attorney-General or his officers. That a judge must not do.

A finding or recommendation by a Commission of Inquiry to initiate criminal

proceedings does not impose a legal obligation on the Attorney General to

prosecute. Conversely, the absence of such a finding or recommendation,

or the presence of observations favourable to an individual, does not

preclude the Attorney General from instituting criminal proceedings. The

Attorney General is not subject to the dictates of the Commission of Inquiry

and is empowered to exercise independent judgment, having given due

consideration to the material collected by the Commission of Inquiry in the

course of the investigation, the inquiry, or both. Indeed, the language of

section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act itself affirms the discretionary

nature of the Attorney General’s prosecutorial powers. In the course of the

argument before this Court, learned President’s Counsel for the petitioner

conceded that the Attorney General is entitled to act independently, without

being bound by the findings or recommendations of the Commission of

Inquiry.

It is imperative that the decisions of the Attorney General command the

confidence of both the public and the judiciary. If such actions are viewed

with suspicion or perceived as arbitrary without compelling and cogent

reasons, it may undermine the credibility of the prosecutorial process and

erode public confidence in the integrity of the whole justice system. Public

19

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

confidence is the foundation upon which the legitimacy of the justice system

in any country rests. Once it is eroded, anarchy is not far behind.

Prosecutorial discretion is neither absolute nor unfettered

Judicial review is the mechanism by which superior Courts exercise

supervisory jurisdiction over decisions and actions of public authorities, to

ensure compliance with the principles of public law in the performance of

their public functions.

It is settled law that the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General,

though broad and statutorily recognised, is neither absolute nor unfettered.

It remains subject to judicial review. Notably, the Attorney General does not

dispute this position.

Judicial Remedies in Public Law by Clive Lewis (London Sweet & Maxwell

2000), page 24 states:

It is difficult, in principle, to see why the exercise of statutory or

prerogative powers to institute proceedings is not justiciable and open

to review in appropriate circumstances. Analogous common law and

statutory powers to initiate or refuse to initiate proceedings are

reviewable.

In Victor Ivon v. Sarath N. Silva, Attorney General and Another [1998] 1 Sri

LR 340 at 346, Mark Fernando J. held:

It is enough, for the purposes of this case, to say that the Attorney-

General’s power to file (or not to file) an indictment for criminal

defamation is a discretionary power, which is neither absolute nor

unfettered. It is similar to other powers vested by law in public

functionaries. They are held in trust for the public, to be exercised for

the purposes for which they have been conferred, and not otherwise.

20

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

The fact that no public authority in the field of public law has absolute or

unfettered discretion is a well settled principle of law which has long been

recognised in the jurisprudence of this Court. (Padmasiri and Others v.

Inspector General of Police and Others (SC/FR/46/2021, SC Minutes of

23.11.2022 at pages 35-40)

In Premachandra v. Major Montague Jayawickrema and Another [1994] 2 Sri

LR 90 at 105, G.P.S. De Silva C.J. stated:

There are no absolute or unfettered discretions in public law;

discretions are conferred on public functionaries in trust for the public,

to be used for the public good, and the propriety of the exercise of such

discretions is to be judged by reference to the purposes for which they

were so entrusted.

In the Seven Judge Bench decision of this Court in Rajavarothiam

Sampanthan and Others v. Attorney General and Others (SC/FR/351-356,

358-361/2018, SC Minutes of 13.12.2018 at page 67) it was held that “our

Law does not recognize that any public authority, whether they be the

President or an officer of the State or an organ of the State, has unfettered or

absolute discretion or power.”

Administrative Law by Sir William Wade and Christopher Forsyth (op. cit.),

page 295 states:

The common theme of all the authorities so far mentioned is that the

notion of absolute or unfettered discretion is rejected. Statutory power

conferred for public purposes is conferred as it were upon trust, not

absolutely—that is to say, it can validly be used only in the right and

proper way which Parliament when conferring it is presumed to have

intended.

21

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

The following observation made by Lord Wrenbury in Roberts v. Hopwood

[1925] AC 578 at 613 eloquently summarises the standard expected in the

exercise of discretion:

A person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion

upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to do

what he likes merely because he is minded to do so—he must in the

exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In

other words, he must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow

the course which reason directs. He must act reasonably.

How to assess whether discretion has been exercised reasonably? The most

reliable method is to examine the reasons given for the decision. As held in

Sierra Construction Ltd v. Road Development Authority and Others

(SC/FR/135/2023, SC Minutes of 10.02.2025 at page 20):

It is widely accepted that ideally the decision-maker should give

reasons at the time of making the decision and not afterwards. A

decision devoid of reasons is fundamentally flawed and amounts to no

decision. The requirement to provide reasons serves as a safeguard

against arbitrariness and upholds the principles of justice, fairness

and transparency in decision-making. However, if reasons were given

but could not be communicated for some valid reason, the Court may

allow the decision-maker to submit those reasons to the Court if the

decision is challenged for failure to give reasons. Conversely, if reasons

are suggested ex post facto for the first time in Court, they should be

rejected as afterthoughts. The rationale is that reasons must precede

the decision, not follow it. In other words, the decision-maker should

not arrive at a decision based on extraneous factors first and then

somehow attempt to justify it by contriving reasons.

22

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

Judicial review may be sought through prerogative remedies such as

certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus, and quo warranto, on

several grounds conveniently summarised by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil

Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374 at 410

(commonly referred to as the GCHQ case), namely: illegality, irrationality,

and procedural impropriety. As Lord Diplock himself observed, this

categorisation is not exhaustive but was intended as a framework of

convenience. He further noted that he had in mind, in particular, the

potential future recognition of the principle of proportionality as an

additional ground of judicial review.

Lord Diplock sought to explain the meaning he attributed to those terms.

Briefly put, illegality refers to decisions made ultra vires or in breach of legal

requirements or mala fide; irrationality concerns decisions so arbitrary and

unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker, properly directing his

mind to the relevant matters, could have arrived at them; and procedural

impropriety encompasses failures to comply with mandatory procedural

requirements or breaches of the principles of natural justice.

Courts exercise caution in reviewing prosecutorial discretion

In general terms, the above grounds are applicable when challenging the

prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General by way of judicial review.

However, as the Court of Appeal has rightly observed in its judgment, “the

judicial review applications challenging the prosecutorial discretion of the

Attorney General has to be examined very carefully”, and not as a matter of

routine. If every accused, upon the filing of an indictment, is entitled as of

right to invoke the writ jurisdiction to challenge the Attorney General’s

discretion or the manner in which it was exercised, the prosecutorial

process would be exposed to repeated collateral attacks, ultimately

undermining public confidence in the justice system. The Court of Appeal

has acknowledged this concern when it stated, “I am aware that the Attorney

23

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

General is not essentially bound to divulge evidence before a Review Court to

justify his reasons to forward an indictment.”

In R (Corner House Research) v. Director of the Serious Fraud Office [2008]

UKHL 60 at paras 30 and 31, Lord Bingham highlighted the broad

discretionary powers vested in the Director of the Serious Fraud Office and

the complexity of the decision-making process involved, to emphasise that

the Courts should not lightly interfere with the exercise of the prosecutorial

discretion.

It is common ground in these proceedings that the Director [of Serious

Fraud Office] is a public official appointed by the Crown but

independent of it. He is entrusted by Parliament with discretionary

powers to investigate suspected offences which reasonably appear to

him to involve serious or complex fraud and to prosecute in such cases.

These are powers given to him by Parliament as head of an

independent, professional service who is subject only to the

superintendence of the Attorney General. There is an obvious analogy

with the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is accepted

that the decisions of the Director are not immune from review by the

courts, but authority makes plain that only in highly exceptional cases

will the court disturb the decisions of an independent prosecutor and

investigator: R v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex p C [1995] 1 Cr App

R 136, 141; R v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex p Manning [2001]

QB 330, para 23; R (Bermingham) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office

[2007] QB 727, paras 63—64; Mohit v Director of Public Prosecutions

of Mauritius [2006] 1 WLR 3343, paras 17 and 21 citing and endorsing

a passage in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Fiji in Matalulu v

Director of Public Prosecutions [2003] 4 LRC 712, 735—736; Sharma v

Brown-Antoine [2007] 1 WLR 780, para 14(1)—(6). The House was not

24

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

referred to any case in which a challenge had been made to a decision

not to prosecute or investigate on public interest grounds.

The reasons why the courts are very slow to interfere are well

understood. They are, first, that the powers in question are entrusted

to the officers identified, and to no one else. No other authority may

exercise these powers or make the judgments on which such exercise

must depend. Secondly, the courts have recognised (as it was

described in the cited passage from Matalulu v Director of Public

Prosecutions) ‘the polycentric character of official decision-making in

such matters including policy and public interest considerations which

are not susceptible of judicial review because it is within neither the

constitutional function nor the practical competence of the courts to

assess their merits’. Thirdly, the powers are conferred in very broad

and unprescriptive terms.

The office of the Attorney General in England and Sri Lanka shares some

broad similarities in function but differs significantly in constitutional

structure, powers, and degree of independence. In discussing the law in

England, De Smith’s Judicial Review, 8th Edition, at 125–126, under the

sub-heading “Public functions outside the court’s jurisdiction”, observes as

follows:

Challenges to certain decisions made by the HM Attorney General may

also fall outside the court’s supervisory jurisdiction. These are the

functions, some derived from prerogative powers, others from statutes,

in respect of which the Attorney General makes decisions

independently of ministerial colleagues and for which he is responsible

to Parliament including: entering a nolle prosequi to stop a prosecution

on indictment (very rarely exercised, usually on the ground of the

defendant’s ill health); he may institute prosecution; direct the Director

of Public Prosecutions to take over a prosecution; and give or withhold

25

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

his consent (“fiat”) to a relator action brought by a person to enforce the

law. The House of Lords in Attorney General v. Gouriet [1978] AC 435

at 487 (Viscount Dilhorne) held that “in the exercise of these powers he

is not subject to direction by his ministerial colleagues or to control and

supervision by the courts”, though the Privy Council has subsequently

highlighted that since the GCHQ case [1985] AC 374 put the matter

beyond doubt, prerogative powers do generally fall with the court’s

jurisdiction, and there is no inherent objection to the court’s jurisdiction

being invoked where the Attorney General is exercising a statutory

power. (footnotes omitted)

In the same treatise, at pages 117–118, it is further observed as follows:

Even where matters are within the court’s jurisdiction, there is a

marked reluctance to exercise that supervisory jurisdiction over police

decisions to investigate, charge, and administer cautions; and

decisions of the DPP to prosecute, to continue or discontinue criminal

prosecutions. The court will generally do so only if there is a grave

abuse of power or a clear breach of the police or prosecuting authority’s

settled policy. (footnotes omitted)

In the discussion under boundaries of judicial review, Administrative Law

by Sir William Wade and Christopher Forsyth (op. cit.) at page 533 states

that “In general the courts are very slow to interfere on decisions to

investigate and prosecute crime.”

Accordingly, in S v. Crown Prosecution Service [2015] EWHC 2868 (Admin),

it was held by the High Court of England and Wales at para 15:

There is no doubt that decisions of the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service]

are amenable to judicial review: see for example, R v DPP ex parte C

[1995] 1 Cr App R 136 at 140-141. The potential grounds for challenge

are, however, narrow not least because of the recognition of the

26

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

constitutional significance of its independence. Clearly, if a policy is

unlawful, the courts will intervene. The same approach will be adopted

if the CPS fail to act in accordance with its set policy or they reach a

decision not open to a reasonable prosecutor. When considering such

challenges, it is clear that they will succeed only in very rare cases.

In the recent Privy Council case of Director of Public Prosecutions (Appellant)

v. Chris Durham and Two Others (Trinidad and Tobago) (supra) at para 6,

Lady Carr stated:

It is common ground that, although a decision to prosecute (or to

continue to prosecute) is in principle susceptible to judicial review, such

relief will in practice be granted only extremely rarely. It is a “highly

exceptional remedy” (see Sharma v Brown-Antoine [2006] UKPC 57;

[2007] 1 WLR 780 (“Sharma”) at para 14(5)).

In Sharma v. Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions & Ors (Trinidad and

Tobago) [2006] UKPC 57, Lord Bingham in the Privy Council at para 14(5)

stated:

It is also well-established that judicial review of a prosecutorial

decision, although available in principle, is a highly exceptional

remedy. The language of the cases shows a uniform approach: ‘rare in

the extreme’ (R v Inland Revenue Comrs, Ex p Mead [1993] 1 All ER

772, 782); ‘sparingly exercised’ (R v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex

p C [1995] 1 Cr App R 136, 140); ‘very hesitant’ (Kostuch v Attorney

General of Alberta (1995) 128 DLR (4th) 440, 449); ‘very rare indeed’

(R (Pepushi) v Crown Prosecution Service [2004] Imm AR 549, para 49);

‘very rarely’ (R (Bermingham) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office

[2007] QB 727, para 63. In R v Director of Public Prosecutions, Ex p

Kebilene [2000] 2 AC 326, 371, Lord Steyn said ‘My Lords, I would rule

that absent dishonesty or mala fides or an exceptional circumstance,

27

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

the decision of the Director to consent to the prosecution of the

applicants is not amenable to judicial review.’

Referring to Sharma v. Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions & Ors (Trinidad

and Tobago) (supra), the Privy Council in Director of Public Prosecutions

(Appellant) v. Chris Durham and Two Others (Trinidad and Tobago) (supra)

at para 60 stated:

Whilst the standard of review must not be set so high as to deprive an

aggrieved citizen of their only effective remedy, the reasons for the

highly restrictive approach confirmed in Sharma are well understood.

In summary:

(i) The prosecutorial powers are entrusted to the DPP and to no one

else;

(ii) The polycentric character of official decision-making in

prosecutorial decisions, referred to above. It is within neither the

constitutional function nor the practical competence of the courts

to assess the merits of such decision-making;

(iii) The powers are conferred on the DPP in very broad and

unprescriptive terms;

(iv) The delays inevitably caused to the criminal trial if judicial review

proceedings proceed, and the desirability of all challenges taking

place in the criminal trial or on appeal;

(v) The great weight to be accorded to the judgment of experienced

prosecutors on whether a jury is likely to convict;

(vi) The fact that an independent prosecutor will be bound by a code

of conduct;

(vii) The need to avoid undermining prosecutorial effectiveness by

subjecting the prosecutor’s motive and decision-making to outside

inquiry.

28

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

The need for avoiding routine second-guessing of the exercise of

prosecutorial discretion has been elucidated by the Supreme Court of

Canada in R v. Anderson [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167 at paras 46 and 47:

[46] The many decisions that Crown prosecutors are called upon to

make in the exercise of their prosecutorial discretion must not be

subjected to routine second-guessing by the courts. The courts have

long recognized that decisions involving prosecutorial discretion are

unlike other decisions made by the executive: see M. Code, “Judicial

Review of Prosecutorial Decisions: A Short History of Costs and

Benefits, in Response to Justice Rosenberg” (2009) 34 Queen’s L.J.

863, at p. 867. Judicial noninterference with prosecutorial discretion

has been referred to as a “matter of principle based on the doctrine of

separation of powers as well as a matter of policy founded on the

efficiency of the system of criminal justice” which also recognizes that

prosecutorial discretion is “especially ill-suited to judicial review”:

(….)

[47] The Court also noted the more practical problems associated with

regular review of prosecutorial discretion: The quasi-judicial function of

the Attorney General cannot be subjected to interference from parties

who are not as competent to consider the various factors involved in

making a decision to prosecute. To subject such decisions to political

interference, or to judicial supervision, could erode the integrity of our

system of prosecution.

There is ample local jurisprudence supporting this approach.

In King v. Fernando (1905) 8 NLR 354, the discretion of the Attorney General

was challenged not on the basis that the accused ought not to have been

prosecuted, but rather on the forum in which the proceedings were

instituted. In that context, at page 355, Layard C.J. observed:

29

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

I do not think that it is desirable in every case to interfere with the

discretion vested in the Attorney-General. The only cases in which this

Court should interfere is when the Attorney-General has abused the

discretion left to him, and these cases are very rarely likely to arise.

Similar sentiments were echoed by Shaw J. in King v. Baba Singho (1919)

21 NLR 142 at 144:

With regard to the other objection, it is within the discretion of the

Attorney-General to direct to what Court a case shall be committed and

what offence he shall be indicted for, and it appears to me that it should

only be in some extreme case that the Court of Appeal should interfere

with the discretion so given to him and direct a trial in a different Court.

Having considered inter alia the aforesaid authorities, in Fakhir v. Attorney

General [2021] 1 Sri LR 230, Obeyesekere J. in the Court of Appeal rejected

the application of the petitioner to quash the indictment filed against him,

noting at 237-238:

[T]he decision of the Attorney General to indict the Petitioner based on

the contents of his confession is reasonable. It is certainly not a

decision that attracts the definition of unreasonableness set out by

Lord Greene in Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v.

Wednesbury Corporation, where unreasonableness has been defined

as “something so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that

it lay within the powers of the authority.”

In Sarath de Abrew vs. Chanaka Iddamalgoda, Chief Inspector of Police and

Others (SC/FR/424/2015, SC Minutes 11.01.2016 at page 12),

Jayawardena J. stated:

Where the legislature has confided the power on the Attorney General

to forward indictment with a discretion how it is to be used, it is beyond

30

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

the power of Court to contest that discretion unless such discretion has

been exercised mala fide or an ulterior motive or in excess of his

jurisdiction.

The aforesaid principle has been reaffirmed by Aluwihare J. in Ganeshan

Samson Roy v. M.M. Janaka Marasinghe and Others (SC/FR/405/2018, SC

Minutes of 20.09.2023 at page 25):

Although the discretion of the Attorney General regarding forwarding

of indictments is reviewable, the circumstances in which the Court will

intervene are rare. Prosecutorial powers are entrusted to identified

officers and no other authority can exercise them or make judgments;

it is not within the Courts’ constitutional function to assess the merits

of the polycentric character of official decision-making in such matters.

The Court will only intervene when the decision is prima facie,

arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful.

Having considered the facts of that case, Aluwihare J. took the view that

the decision to indict the petitioner was unreasonable and arbitrary, stating

inter alia that the indicting State Counsel and the officer who supervised

and sanctioned the indictment, had failed in their duty to consider the facts

objectively before taking the decision to indict the petitioner.

Court must intervene when the interests of justice demand

The above judgment underscores the important principle that Courts must

not hesitate to intervene where circumstances so warrant.

If the Attorney General exceeds the lawful bounds of his authority, or fails

to exercise prosecutorial discretion properly—whether by taking into

account irrelevant factors, yielding to political pressure, acting on

extraneous considerations, or the like—the Court is not only empowered

but duty-bound to intervene. Whether such considerations have in fact

31

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

tainted the decision, thereby warranting judicial review, must be

determined on a case-by-case basis.

In the House of Lords case of R (Corner House Research) v. Director of the

Serious Fraud Office (supra) at para 32 it was held:

Of course, and this again is uncontroversial, the discretions conferred

on the Director are not unfettered. He must seek to exercise his powers

so as to promote the statutory purpose for which he is given them. He

must direct himself correctly in law. He must act lawfully. He must do

his best to exercise an objective judgment on the relevant material

available to him. He must exercise his powers in good faith,

uninfluenced by any ulterior motive, predilection or prejudice. In the

present case, the claimants have not sought to impugn the Director’s

good faith and honesty in any way.

The Court of Appeal in the impugned judgment has expressed concerns

regarding politically motivated prosecutions. It states, “It is often seen that

the change of Government is considered as a barren mandate to institute

criminal proceedings or withdrawal of criminal proceedings by the authorities

against respective political opponents based only on political motivation. This

kind of unfortunate occurrences will never emerge if an unvarying due

process and fairness is in its place steadily.”

Politically motivated indictments following regime change as well as the

selective withdrawal of indictments for similar reasons, pose a serious

threat to the rule of law and public confidence in the office of the Attorney

General and the entire justice system. Judicial oversight plays a vital role

in ensuring that prosecutorial discretion is exercised independently, fairly,

and in compliance with the law.

32

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

Grounds of review identified by the Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal in the impugned decision has enumerated the following

grounds upon which the Attorney General’s decision to forward an

indictment may be challenged by way of judicial review:

(1) Whether mere objective of leading evidence for the prosecution in

the trial court is not for the purpose of establishing the ingredients

of the charge against the accused.

(2) Whether leading evidence for the prosecution in the trial court;

(i) Cannot establish the ingredients of the charge due to any

restrictions of a written law.

(ii) Will not be sufficient for the Trial Judge efficaciously and

adequately determine any primary issue with mixed facts

and law or an issue of law.

(3) Applicability of the ‘No evidence rule’ in exceptional

circumstances.

(4) If the Attorney General has taken a decision assuming a

jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeding his jurisdiction.

(5) If the Attorney General has taken a decision exercising his

prosecutorial discretion in bad faith/mala fide or with ulterior

motive or with political motivation.

(6) The decision would amount to an abuse of process.

(7) Procedural irregularity or existence of any illegality during the

decision making process.

(8) If there is a clear miscarriage of justice.

It appears that the Court of Appeal considered the Attorney General’s

discretion in the present case to be amenable to review under grounds (1),

2(i), and (3) above. In addition, the Court seems to have taken the view that

the failure to adhere to “due process” constitutes a further ground that

33

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

renders the Attorney General’s discretion invalid in this instance. I will

advert to those matters later in this judgment.

The Court of Appeal in its judgment highlights:

The contention of the petitioner is that it is not lawful for the 1st

respondent to exhibit information before the High Court at Bar based

only on the material collected at the Commission of Inquiry as the

Commission of Inquiry had not recommended to institute criminal

action against the petitioner in respect of the meetings held on

28.03.2016 or 30.03.2016.

Limits of writ jurisdiction

As previously stated, this is a complex case involving intricate financial

offences. The investigation and prosecution of such offences require a

certain degree of expertise and familiarity with financial and regulatory

frameworks.

Just as the exercise of discretion is subject to limits, so too is the scope of

judicial review. On the limits of Courts in the context of judicial review of

administrative actions due to constraints of specialised expertise, the

Supreme Court of India in Tata Cellular v. Union of India 1996 AIR 11 at 28

stated:

In Chief Justice Neely’s words, “I have very few illusions about my own

limitations as a Judge and from those limitations I generalize to the

inherent limitations of all appellate courts reviewing rate cases. It must

be remembered that this Court sees approximately 1,262 cases a year

with five Judges. I am not an accountant, electrical engineer, financier,

banker, stock broker, or systems management analyst. It is the height

of folly to expect Judges intelligently to review a 5,000 page record

addressing the intricacies of public utility operation.” It is not the

34

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

function of a Judge to act as a super board, or with the zeal of a

pedantic school master substituting its judgment for that of the

administrator.

The result is a theory of review that limits the extent to which the

discretion of the expert may be scrutinized by the non-expert Judge.

The alternative is for the court to overrule the agency on technical

matters where all the advantages of expertise lie with the agencies. If

a court were to review fully the decision of a body such as State Board

of Medical Examiners “it would find itself wandering amid the maze of

therapeutics or boggling at the mysteries of the Pharmacopoeia”. Such

a situation as a State Court expressed it many years ago “is not a case

of the blind leading the blind but of one who has always been deaf and

blind insisting that he can see and hear better than one who has

always had his eyesight and hearing and has always used them to

the utmost advantage in ascertaining the truth in regard to the matter

in question.”

In the case of Uflex Ltd. v. Government of Tamil Nadu & Ors [2021] 7 SCR

571, which involved a challenge to a tender process issued by the

Government of Tamil Nadu on the basis of unfair conditions, the Supreme

Court reinforcing the limited scope of judicial review in technical matters at

579-580 stated as follows:

The judicial review of such contractual matters has its own limitations.

It is in this context of judicial review of administrative actions that this

Court has opined that it is intended to prevent arbitrariness,

irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and mala fide. The purpose is to

check whether the choice of decision is made lawfully and not to check

whether the choice of decision is sound. In evaluating tenders and

awarding contracts, the parties are to be governed by principles of

35

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

commercial prudence. To that extent, principles of equity and natural

justice have to stay at a distance.

We cannot lose sight of the fact that a tenderer or contractor with a

grievance can always seek damages in a civil court and thus,

“attempts by unsuccessful tenderers with imaginary grievances,

wounded pride and business rivalry, to make mountains out of

molehills of some technical/procedural violation or some prejudice to

self, and persuade courts to interfere by exercising power of judicial

review, should be resisted” (Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa, (2007)

14 SCC 517).

In exercising its power of review, the judiciary is not expected to assume the

role of a super-auditor. As observed by the Supreme Court of India in

Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union (Regd.), Sindri and Others v. Union of

India and Others (1981) 1 SCC 568 at 584:

We certainly agree that judicial interference with the administration

cannot be meticulous in our Montesquien system of separation of

powers. The Court cannot usurp or abdicate, and the parameters of

judicial review must be clearly defined and never exceeded. If the

Directorate of a Government company has acted fairly, even if it has

faltered in its wisdom, the court cannot, as a super-auditor, take the

Board of Directors to task. This function is limited to testing whether

the administrative action has been fair and free from the taint of

unreasonableness and has substantially complied with the norms of

procedure set for it by rules of public administration.

This Court has acknowledged the fact that in view of certain institutional

limitations, caution must be exercised in revisiting decisions that are highly

technical in nature. In this regard, this Court held in Sierra Construction

Ltd v. Road Development Authority and Others (supra) at pages 10-11:

36

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

The petitioner did not file any report expressing expert opinion to the

contrary. Neither the Court nor the petitioner possesses the requisite

expertise, resources and capacity to challenge through a fundamental

rights application the accuracy of the findings in the several reports

filed by the Technical Evaluation Committee, the Ministry Procurement

Committee, and the Expert Committee appointed by the Court. Based

on the facts and circumstances of the case, the findings in those reports

are not perverse and are prima facie acceptable to the Court. In such

cases, in exercising its writ or fundamental rights jurisdiction, this

Court must exercise caution in revisiting decisions that are highly

technical in nature. This restraint is necessitated by the Court’s

institutional limitations.

De Smith’s Judicial Review (op. cit.), page 206 states:

Judicial review has developed to the point where it is possible to say

that no power—whether statutory, common law or under the

prerogative—is any longer inherently unreviewable. Courts are

charged with the responsibility of adjudicating upon the manner of the

exercise of a public power, its scope and its substance. As we shall

see, even when discretionary powers are engaged, they are not

immune from judicial review. Discretion has been described as the

“hole in the [legal] doughnut”, but that hole is not automatically a

lawless void. Nevertheless, there are certain decisions which courts

cannot or should not easily engage. Courts are limited (a) by their

constitutional role and (b) by their institutional capacity.

(……)

A second institutional limitation of the courts is lack of relative

expertise. Particularly as the review of fact, or the merits of a decision,

37

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

is not routinely permitted in judicial review, there are some matters

which are best resolved by those with specialist knowledge.

In that context, there is absolutely no justification for the writ Court, before

the case is taken up for trial in the Trial Court, to examine the limited set

of documents selectively tendered by the parties for the purpose of the writ

application and decide to quash the indictment on the basis that there is

insufficient evidence to prosecute the petitioner in the High Court at Bar.

Writ will not lie where material facts are in dispute

The Court of Appeal rightly acknowledges the well-established principle that

when major facts are in dispute, writ does not lie. The writ Court is not a

Trial Court, and its role is not to evaluate contested evidence and determine

the matter on its merits.

At page 24 of the impugned judgment, the Court of Appeal states:

I am mindful of the cardinal principle that where the facts are in dispute

and in order to discover the truth, it is necessary that the questions

should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample

opportunity to examine their witnesses. (see-Thajudeen vs. Sri Lanka

Tea Board and another (1981) 2 Sri. L.R. 471). One may argue that the

issues raised by the Petitioner can be easily and effectively canvassed

before the relevant High Court-at-Bar. Anyhow, it is important to bear

in mind that the 1st Respondent has decided to indict the Petitioner as

a consequence to the Report of Commission of Inquiry.

In St Helens Borough Council v. Manchester Primary Care Trust & Another

[2008] EWCA Civ 931 at para 13 Lord Justice May stated:

Judicial review is a flexible, but not entirely unfenced jurisdiction. This

stems from certain intrinsic features. The court’s relevant function is to

review decisions of statutory and other public authorities to see that

38

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

they are lawful, rational and reached by a fair and due process. The

public authority is normally the primary decision maker with a duty to

apprehend the facts underlying the decision by a fair procedure which

takes properly into account all relevant facts and circumstances. If the

public authority does this, the court will not normally examine the

merits of the factual determination. Accordingly, a court hearing a

judicial review application normally receives evidence in writing only,

and does not set about determining questions of disputed fact.

In this case, the petitioner does not accept the evidence led or findings made

by the Commission of Inquiry based on such evidence, which were relied

upon by the Attorney General. The petitioner does not accept that he

instructed the representatives of the three state banks to bid only within

specified yield rates at the treasury bond auctions and assured them that

only bids within that range would be accepted by the Central Bank. The

main items of material evidence against the petitioner were elicited from the

testimony of officials from the three main state banks. This forms the core

foundation of the case against the petitioner.

Given the above items of evidence presented before the Commission, how

can the Court of Appeal, in the exercise of writ jurisdiction, quash the

indictment on the ground that there was not “adequate material and

evidence particularly against the petitioner”? The question whether the

evidence led through these witnesses is reliable and adequate should be left

for the Trial Court to determine.

The petitioner’s alleged involvement as revealed in the final report

The Court of Appeal has referred to certain observations, findings, and

recommendations contained in the final report of the Commission of Inquiry

that are adverse to the petitioner and remain undisturbed. These are

reproduced at pages 19–20 of the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The

39

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

Court of Appeal inter alia has quoted the following paragraph from the final

report:

We would reasonably expect that, since the then Minister of Finance

had instructed the National Savings Bank, Peoples’ Bank and Bank of

Ceylon to place Bids at these Yield Rates, which were considerably

lower than the Yield Rates which the Market expected to obtain at these

Auctions, these three State Banks are likely to have faced a degree of

restriction when they placed at the Treasury Bond Auction held on 29th

March 2016 since Bids at these specified Yield Rates, which would,

almost inevitably, be accepted, will not represent the most profitable

investments possible in the prevailing Market. The witnesses from the

National Savings Bank, Peoples’ Bank and Bank of Ceylon who gave

evidence before us confirmed that, these three State Banks were of that

view.

Chapter 24 of the final report of the Commission of Inquiry addresses

certain aspects of the petitioner’s involvement in the events under scrutiny.

It states:

We are of the view that evidence before us suggests that, Hon. Ravi

Karunanayake, while he was Minister of Finance, derived a

substantial benefit from the lease payments made by Walt and Row

Associates (Pvt) Ltd, which is an associate company of Perpetual

Treasuries Ltd and which is owned and controlled by the same persons

who own and control Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.

The Commission of Inquiry further states that, at meetings held at the

Ministry of Finance on 28.03.2016 and 30.03.2016, the petitioner, in his

capacity as Minister of Finance, instructed the representatives of the three

state banks to bid at specified low yield rates at the Treasury bond auctions

held on 29.03.2016 and 31.03.2016. It also notes that these instructions

40

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

were not communicated to the Central Bank, and that Perpetual Treasuries

Ltd., having received such “inside information”, was able to gain a

significant advantage at the said bond auctions. The Commission of Inquiry

has also made reference to blatant falsehoods uttered by the petitioner,

under oath, in an attempt to conceal the truth.

The Commission of Inquiry states:

Perpetual Treasuries Ltd obtained a License to operate as a Primary

Dealer on the 01st October 2013.

Perpetual Treasuries Ltd commenced Business in early 2014 and

during the remaining few months of the financial Year ended 31st

March 2014, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd made a Net Loss of Rs. 3.7

Million.

During the next Financial Year from 01st April 2014 to 31st March 2015,

Perpetual Treasuries Ltd made a Net Profit of Rs. 959.5 million.

In the next Financial Year from 01st April 2015 to 31st March 2016,

which falls within the period of our Mandate, the Net Profit made by

Perpetual Treasuries Ltd rose remarkably sharply to Rs. 5.124 Billion.

In the following Financial Year commencing from the 01st April 2016

and ending on 31st March 2017, the Net Profit made by Perpetual

Treasuries Ltd increased further to Rs. 6.365 Billion.

Although the Financial Year is chronologically outside the period of our

Mandate, the profits made by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd during that

period are relevant to us and can be properly considered as falling

within the ambit of our Mandate, for the reason that, the evidence

shows that a major part of this profit was realised by the disposal of

Treasury Bonds acquired by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd during the period

of our Mandate.

41

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

In reference to the meetings held with the officials of the state banks, the

Commission of Inquiry states:

We note that, these meetings were held at the Ministry of Finance and

Hon. Ravi Karunanayake gave these instructions, soon after he moved

into the Apartment for which Walt and Row Associates (Pvt) Ltd paid

the Lease Rental.

Further evidence presented before the Commission of Inquiry revealed that,

after meetings with these state bank officials, the petitioner moved into an

apartment (penthouse) where the rent was paid by the owners of Perpetual

Treasuries Ltd., the primary dealer. This apartment was subsequently

purchased by a company named Global Transportation and Logistics (Pvt)

Ltd., which is owned and controlled by members of the petitioner’s family.

The owner of the apartment, Anika Wijesuriya, gave evidence regarding this

matter.

The approach of the Court of Appeal

I do not intend, for the purposes of this appeal, to scrutinise in detail all the

evidence (direct and circumstantial) led before the Commission of Inquiry,

or the observations, assertions, findings, or recommendations made by the

Commission against the petitioner. However, in view of the material elicited

thus far, the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in this matter is

untenable. The Court of Appeal states:

It is abundantly clear that the Commission of Inquiry has not made an

expressed recommendation or direction against the Petitioner under the

said Chapters 32 and 33, although, the Commission of Inquiry has

expressed an opinion that the Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) should examine as mentioned above

whether appropriate actions should be taken against the Petitioner

under the Bribery Act. The other opinion expressed by the Commission

42

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

of Inquiry referring to the truthfulness of evidence given by the

Petitioner is also based on alleged telephonic communication between

the Petitioner and Mr. Arjun Aloysius. As observed above, the CIABOC

has already instituted proceedings against the Petitioner.

Hence, I take the view that the assertions or observations or

recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry in reference to

the meetings on 28.03.2016 and 30.03.2016 and the purported

allegations levelled against the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent on

instructions given to the State Banks are merely in the nature of

assertions or observations of the Commission of Inquiry and not

expressed determinations.

The Court of Appeal states that the aforesaid findings “are merely in the

nature of assertions or observations of the Commission of Inquiry and not

expressed determinations”. I regret that I am unable to agree. I must observe

that even the petitioner does not take this position. As I stated previously,

in the petition filed before the Court of Appeal, the petitioner characterises

them as “decisions” made by the Commission of Inquiry. But even assuming

without conceding that they are merely assertions or observations and not

determinations in the strict sense, it does not follow that they are devoid of

evidentiary value. The Attorney General may take such assertions, together

with other material lawfully gathered, into account in deciding to indict the

petitioner on specific charges under the Penal Code and other relevant

statutes, in terms of the powers vested in the Attorney General by the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act.

The Court of Appeal proceeds to state that the Commission of Inquiry had

merely recommended the institution of proceedings against the petitioner

under the Bribery Act, if deemed appropriate, and since such proceedings

have already been instituted by the Commission to Investigate Allegations

of Bribery or Corruption, there was, in its view, no adequate basis to initiate

43

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

criminal proceedings under section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act.

With respect, I am unable to agree with this reasoning.

Firstly, no copy of the proceedings, if any, instituted by the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption has been tendered to this

Court, thereby precluding this Court from ascertaining whether such

proceedings have in fact been initiated, and if so, on what charges.

Secondly, notwithstanding the possibility that proceedings may have been

instituted under the Bribery Act in relation to the apartment issue, the

Attorney General is not precluded from relying on the same items of

evidence, together with other material, to support the proof of distinct and

separate charges in the indictment filed before the Trial-at-Bar.

It must be emphasised that the charges framed against the petitioner in the

indictment are not based on the apartment transaction, but arise from other

incidents involving alleged criminal misconduct, which are entirely separate

and independent of the matter referred to the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. It is also relevant to note that the

petitioner did not allege that the principle of double jeopardy had been

violated by the Attorney General.

The Court of Appeal has referred to several legal principles such as “due

process” and the “no evidence rule” in support of its conclusion. However, I

find it difficult to understand how those principles are meaningfully

connected to the facts of this case. This is the concluding part of the

judgment of the Court of Appeal.

For the reasons set out above, I take the view that the Attorney General

should be satisfied by following due process that adequate evidence

and material are available to prosecute an accused against whom no

express recommendation or a determination has been made by the

COI, before commencing criminal proceedings against such accused

44

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

under section 24 of the COI Act. The 1st respondent is unsuccessful in

establishing before this Court the fact that the 1st respondent has

followed such due process for him to be satisfied upon the availability

of adequate material and evidence particularly against the Petitioner.

This requirement will be certainly different if the COI has made clear

and express pronouncements in respect of persons who are implicated

in the matter under inquiry or any other appropriate persons under

section 16 of the COI Act. I am highly influenced in this regard by the

admissions of the 1st Respondent in his Statement of Objections

supported by an affidavit that the information was exhibited by the 1st

Respondent on the charges that were contemplated against the

petitioner on the basis of the material gathered at the COI.

The information exhibited by the 1st Respondent in respect of the

offences to be tried against the Petitioner before the High Court-at-Bar

appears to be directly based on alleged facts and circumstances

reflected on the Report of the COI. I need to reiterate that the assertions

or observations or recommendations made by the COI in reference to

the meetings on 28.03.2016 and 30.03.2016 and the purported

allegations levelled against the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent on the

instructions given to the State Banks are merely in the nature of

assertions or observations of the COI and such assertions or

observations cannot be considered ‘material’ as intended by the

legislature in the said Section 24 of the COI Act.

In view of my above findings and based on special circumstances of

this case, I am of the opinion that the mere leading of evidence for the

Prosecution against the Petitioner in the Trial Court cannot establish

the ingredients of the charges due to the restrictions of a written law.

Additionally, the decision to indict the Petitioner cannot be assumed as

45

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

a decision taken following the process and with adequate evidence in

terms of the ‘No evidence rule’.

Hence, I proceed to issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

made by the 1st Respondent to charge the Petitioner by way of an

indictment and/or information on the charges bearing Nos. 1, 3, 14, 15

and 16 contained in the document marked ‘P10’ in relation to case No

HC(TAB)2445/2021. The judgement should not impede or obstruct any

investigations to be conducted against the Petitioner nor shall this

judgement impede or obstruct the 1st Respondent from maintaining the

Indictment bearing Case No. HC (TAB) 2445/2021 against the 1st, 3rd

to 11th Accused, before the High Court-at-Bar.

As already discussed, the reasoning set out in the concluding part of the

judgment of the Court of Appeal cannot be justified.

The Court of Appeal states that “the mere leading of evidence for the

prosecution against the Petitioner in the trial court cannot establish the

ingredients of the charges due to the restrictions of a written law” and “the

decision to indict the Petitioner cannot be assumed as a decision taken

following due process and with adequate evidence in terms of the No evidence

rule”.

It is not entirely clear what the Court of Appeal intended by these

expressions or findings. When it refers to “the restrictions of a written law”,

neither the specific written law in contemplation nor the nature of the

purported restrictions has been clearly identified. Those expressions appear

to conflate two distinct concepts: “due process” and “no evidence rule”.

Those are broad legal concepts.

Due process largely refers to the fairness and legality of the procedure

adopted in the decision-making process, whereas the no evidence rule refers

to patent lack of evidence to support a conviction.

46

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

It appears that the Court of Appeal thought that due process was not

followed as there is no adequate evidence to indict the petitioner in terms of

the no evidence rule. As I have already made it clear, there is no basis for

applying the “no evidence rule” to the facts and circumstances of this case.

Administrative Law by Sir William Wade and Christopher Forsyth (op. cit.),

clearly encapsulates the current position of the development of the “no

evidence rule” at page 227 as follows:

Findings of fact are traditionally the domain where a deciding authority

or tribunal is master in its own house. Provided only that it stays within

its jurisdiction, its findings are in general exempt from review by the

courts, which will in any case respect the decision of the body that saw

and heard the witnesses or took evidence directly. Just as the courts

look jealously on decisions by other bodies on matters of law, so they

look indulgently on their decisions on matters of fact.

But the limit of this indulgence is reached where findings are based on

no satisfactory evidence. It is one thing to weigh conflicting evidence

which might justify a conclusion either way, or to evaluate evidence

wrongly. It is another thing to altogether make insupportable finding.

This is an abuse of power and may cause grave injustice. At this point,

therefore, the court is disposed to intervene.

‘No evidence’ does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It extends

to any case where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not reasonably

capable of supporting the finding; or where, in other words, no tribunal

could reasonably reach that conclusion on that evidence. This ‘no

evidence’ principle clearly has something in common with the principle

that perverse or unreasonable action is unauthorised and ultra vires.

It also has some affinity with the substantial evidence rule of

47

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

Americanlaw, which requires that findings be supported by substantial

evidence on the record as a whole.

It is to be noted that the no evidence rule has only opened up a very narrow

path for the Courts to review non-jurisdictional errors of fact. The onset of

this development marked by the statement of Lord Denning in Ashbridge

Investments Ltd v. Minister of Housing and Local Government [1965] 1 WLR

1320 at 1326 reflects the threshold of glaring indefensibility or irrationality

of the decision required for the application of the no evidence rule:

[T]he Court can interfere with the Minister's decision if he has acted on

no evidence, or if he has come to a decision to which on the evidence

he could not reasonably come; or if he has given a wrong interpretation

to the words of the statute; or if he has taken into consideration matters

which he ought not to have taken into account, or vice versa; or has

otherwise gone wrong in law. It is identical with the position when the

Court has power to interfere with the decision of a lower tribunal which

has erred in point of law.

Accordingly, P.P. Craig, Administrative Law, 4th Edition, cautions against

judicial review of factual findings at page 495 as follows:

[T]he general test should be whether there was some reasonable or

sufficient evidence to justify the action. To require more runs the risk of

the courts substituting their view for that of the authority.

…decision-makers tend to reach decisions on the basis of bounded

rationality. They do not have and cannot have all the possibly relevant

materials and evidence before them. No decisions would ever be made

if this were to be demanded. While this may provide some justifications

for ensuring that the decision-maker indicates what was the factual

basis for his action, we should be wary of developing review of facts

upon the premise that all such material could or should be considered.

48

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

It is worth reproducing Lady Carr’s statement in Director of Public

Prosecutions (Appellant) v. Chris Durham and Two Others (Trinidad and

Tobago) (supra) at para 41 that:

It is not the prosecutor’s function to decide whether a person is guilty

of a criminal offence, but rather to make an assessment as to whether

it is appropriate to present charges for the criminal court to consider.

I must add that, as a Divisional Bench of this Court held in Attorney General

v. Inspector General of Police (SC/TAB/3/2023, SC Minutes of 05.11.2024),

known as Easter Sunday Trial-at-Bar case, even the acquittal of an accused

after closing the prosecution case without calling for the defence on the

basis of no case to answer, under section 200(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, is not a decision to be taken lightly. While in full agreement

with the principal judgment delivered by Justice Surasena by which the

acquittal entered after the closure of the prosecution case on the ground of

no case to answer was quashed directing the Trial-at-Bar to call for the

defence, I further analysed the applicability of section 200(1) to conclude

that “At the stage of the close of the prosecution case, the proper question for

the Court to consider is whether the prosecution has made out a prima facie

case to call upon the accused for his defence, not whether the prosecution

has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. The decision whether the

accused is guilty of the charge beyond reasonable doubt should be reserved

until the conclusion of the entire trial.”

It is also pertinent to note that, by the inclusion of section 200(1) in the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the legislature has made provision to

address situations where insufficient evidence is adduced at trial. Thus, the

legislature has recognised that the question of whether sufficient evidence

has been led to establish the ingredients of an offence is a matter for the

trial Judge to determine either upon the close of the prosecution case or

after calling for the defence. In the circumstances of this case, and having

49

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

regard to the facts set out above, the finding of the Court of Appeal that no

evidence existed to prove the charges against the petitioner was premature.

Let me assume, arguendo, that the material found during the Presidential

Commission of Inquiry was inadequate to indict the petitioner.

The error committed by the Court of Appeal in quashing the indictment

against the petitioner was its focus on the fact that the Attorney General’s

decision to indict was based solely on the final report of the Commission of

Inquiry. The Court of Appeal judgment places repeated emphasis on this

matter.

However, as I previously noted, the Attorney General’s decision to indict the

petitioner was not based solely on the final report of the Commission of

Inquiry or the material gathered during its investigation and inquiry. The

Attorney General depended on the material collected during the

investigation carried out by the Criminal Investigation Department, which

was initiated following a written complaint made by the Governor of the

Central Bank, Dr. Coomaraswamy. This was explicitly stated by the

Attorney General in the information presented to the High Court in terms

of section 450(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Without an

investigation conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department with the

guidance of the Attorney General, it would not have been practically

possible for the members of the Commission alone to carry out its mandate.

Had the Court of Appeal taken this fact into serious account, I am certain,

it would have arrived at a different conclusion. The Court of Appeal paid no

attention to this aspect. As I previously mentioned the Court of Appeal

acknowledged “that the Attorney General is not essentially bound to divulge

evidence before a Review Court to justify his reasons to forward an

indictment.”

50

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

Connected to the above, another error committed by the Court of Appeal

was its failure to give due consideration to the non obstante clause at the

beginning of section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, which reads:

“Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, No. 15 of 1979, or any other law…” In my view, the Court of Appeal did

not properly appreciate the significance of this clause. Far from limiting the

Attorney General’s discretion, this part of section 24 reinforces and expands

it. The discretionary power conferred on the Attorney General under the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act or any other law remains unaffected by the

latter part of section 24. That latter part merely provides an additional tool

in the Attorney General’s prosecutorial arsenal. However, the Court of

Appeal appears to have focused solely on this additional tool, disregarding

the broader discretionary framework preserved by the non obstante clause.

At page 17 of the impugned judgment, the Court of Appeal acknowledges

that the principal argument of the petitioner revolved around paragraph 9

of the statement of objections filed by the Attorney General, which stated

that the information was exhibited and charges were framed against the

petitioner on the basis of material gathered at the Commission of Inquiry.

The Court of Appeal placed complete reliance on this averment and shut

out all other material that may have been collected through independent

investigations by other agencies.

By perusing the journal entries of the Court of Appeal docket, it is evident

that after the conclusion of the main argument, the parties were permitted

to file further written submissions and to make additional oral submissions

at several stages for the purpose of further clarifications. Along with the

further written submissions filed by the Attorney General dated 09.01.2023,

the Attorney General tendered a document marked ‘X’, which is a copy of a

letter addressed by the Attorney General to the Inspector General of Police

dated 03.03.2020 in relation to Fort Magistrate’s Court Case No.

51

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

B/8266/2018, with copies to the Fort Magistrate, the DIG/CID, and the

Director/CID.

The Court of Appeal in the impugned judgment notes that the said

document was produced by the Attorney General to underscore that the

decision to indict the petitioner was not based solely on the material

collected during the course of the Commission of Inquiry, but also on other

material independently obtained. This position is clearly reflected in the first

two paragraphs of the document marked ‘X’, which runs into 20 pages. The

first two paragraphs read as follows:

There is no allegation that document ‘X’ is a forgery or one manufactured

for the purpose of the proceedings before the Court of Appeal. Nevertheless,

the Court of Appeal rejected the document on the basis that “the learned

President’s Counsel for the petitioner vehemently objected to tendering a

document along with the written submissions and moved that the said

document be rejected.” In a matter of this complexity and national

importance, the Court of Appeal ought not to have adopted such a narrow

and technical approach.

There was an opportunity for the petitioner to counter that document, as it

was filed before the case was taken up for further clarifications in open

Court. It is also pertinent to note that the first paragraph of ‘X’ quoted above

is reflected in the information exhibited in terms of section 450(4) of the

Criminal Procedure Code. Thus, the position revealed in document ‘X’ is not

a new position.

It is well to remember that a writ is a discretionary remedy, not one granted

as of right. The exercise of such discretion must be guided by well-settled

principles of judicial restraint. The greater the complexity and contest over

facts, the higher the degree of caution that is warranted.

Conclusion

I answer the question of law on which special leave appeal was granted, i.e.

“Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to appreciate in its judgment, the

presence of section 24 of the Commission of Inquiry Act as amended from its

53

SC/APPEAL/104/2024

correct perspective?”, in the affirmative. The judgment of the Court of Appeal

dated 28.02.2023 is set aside and the appeal is allowed with costs. The writ

application filed by the petitioner in the Court of Appeal shall stand

dismissed.

As agreed, the parties in SC/APPEAL/103/2024 will abide by this

judgment.
