"under oath, in an attempt to conceal the truth."
"The Commission of Inquiry states:"
"Perpetual Treasuries Ltd obtained a  License to operate as a Primary"
"Dealer on the 01st October 2013."
"Perpetual  Treasuries  Ltd  commenced  Business  in  early  2014  and"
"during  the  remaining  few  months  of  the  financial  Year  ended  31st"
"March  2014,  Perpetual  Treasuries  Ltd  made  a  Net  Loss  of  Rs.  3.7"
"Million."
"During the next Financial Year from 01st April 2014 to 31st March 2015,"
"Perpetual Treasuries Ltd made a Net Profit of Rs. 959.5 million."
"In  the next  Financial Year  from 01st  April 2015  to 31st  March  2016,"
"which falls within the period of our Mandate,  the Net Profit made by"
"Perpetual Treasuries Ltd rose remarkably sharply to Rs. 5.124 Billion."
"In  the following Financial Year  commencing from the 01st  April 2016"
"and  ending  on  31st  March  2017,  the  Net  Profit  made  by  Perpetual"
"Treasuries Ltd increased further to Rs. 6.365 Billion."
"Although the Financial Year is chronologically outside the period of our"
"Mandate,  the  profits  made  by  Perpetual  Treasuries  Ltd  during  that"
"period are  relevant to  us  and  can  be  properly considered as  falling"
"within  the  ambit  of  our  Mandate,  for  the  reason  that,  the  evidence"
"shows that a major part of this profit was realised by the disposal of"
"Treasury Bonds acquired by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd during the period"
"of our Mandate."
