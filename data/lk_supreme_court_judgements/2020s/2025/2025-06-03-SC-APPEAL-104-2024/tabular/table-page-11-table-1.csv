"Commission  of  Inquiry  has  acted  in  violation  of  rules  of  Natural  Justice,"
"particularly in respect of the impugned assertions reflected in paragraph (g)"
"of the prayer of the Petition.” Towards the end of its judgment, the Court of"
"Appeal 
identifies 
them  as  “assertions  or  observations.”  The  petitioner"
"identifies  them  as  “decisions”.  The  Court  of  Appeal 
identifies  them  as"
"“assertions”. I might identify them as “findings”."
"Whatever the label one may use, the Commission of Inquiry expressed such"
"views  in the  final report.  Otherwise, there  would have  been  no  reason for"
"learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  to  have  identified  them  as"
"“decisions”  and sought to quash them by way of certiorari. Once the Court"
"of  Appeal  refused  to  quash  those  decisions/assertions/findings/views  of"
"the Commission of Inquiry, they remain valid."
"The  Attorney  General  is  entitled  to  rely  on  the  material  collected  in  the"
"course  of  the  Commission  of  Inquiry in  formulating  charges  against  the"
"petitioner, in terms of section 24 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act."
"In  that  backdrop,  the  Court  of  Appeal  could  have  dismissed 
the  writ"
"application  allowing the Trial Court to determine  those  pure questions  of"
"fact at the trial. Such a course of action would not have prejudiced the rights"
"of the petitioner,  as he would have had the opportunity during the trial to"
"challenge those facts and present his defence."
"In discussing  the boundaries  of judicial review,  Administrative Law by Sir"
"William  Wade  and  Christopher  Forsyth,  11th  Edition,  page  533,  citing  in"
"particular R v. DPP, ex parte Kebelene [1999]  3 WLR 972,  states that “The"
"House of Lords has however held that decisions about prosecutions are not"
"amenable to judicial review where the complaint could equally well be made"
"in the course of trial, since otherwise trials would be unacceptably delayed"
"is  precisely  what  has  happened 
in  the 
by  collateral  proceedings.”  This"
"instant case. The House of Lords in that case affirmed the broad discretion"
