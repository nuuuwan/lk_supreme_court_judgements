"regard to the facts set out above, the finding of the Court of Appeal that no"
"evidence existed to prove the charges against the petitioner was premature."
"Let me assume, arguendo,  that the material found during the Presidential"
"Commission of Inquiry was inadequate to indict the petitioner."
"The  error  committed  by  the  Court of  Appeal  in  quashing  the  indictment"
"against the petitioner was its focus on the fact that the Attorney General’s"
"decision to indict was based solely on the final report of the Commission of"
"Inquiry. The  Court of  Appeal  judgment places  repeated  emphasis  on  this"
"matter."
"However, as I previously noted, the Attorney General’s decision to indict the"
"petitioner  was  not  based  solely  on  the  final  report  of  the  Commission  of"
"Inquiry or the material gathered during its investigation  and inquiry. The"
"Attorney  General 
depended 
on 
the  material 
collected 
during 
the"
"investigation carried out by the Criminal Investigation Department, which"
"was  initiated  following  a  written complaint  made  by  the  Governor  of  the"
"Central  Bank,  Dr.  Coomaraswamy.  This  was  explicitly  stated  by 
the"
"Attorney General in the information presented  to the High Court in terms"
"of  section  450(4)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act.  Without  an"
"investigation conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department with the"
"guidance  of  the  Attorney  General, 
it  would  not  have  been  practically"
"possible for the members of the Commission alone to carry out its mandate."
"Had the Court of Appeal taken this fact into serious account, I am certain,"
"it would have arrived at a different conclusion. The Court of Appeal paid no"
"attention  to  this  aspect.  As  I  previously  mentioned  the  Court  of  Appeal"
"acknowledged  “that the Attorney General is not essentially bound to divulge"
"evidence  before  a  Review  Court 
to 
justify  his  reasons 
to 
forward  an"
"indictment.”"
