"In reference  to the meetings  held with the officials  of the state banks,  the"
"Commission of Inquiry states:"
"We note that, these meetings were held at the Ministry of Finance and"
"Hon. Ravi Karunanayake gave these instructions, soon after he moved"
"into the Apartment for which Walt and Row Associates (Pvt) Ltd paid"
"the Lease Rental."
"Further evidence presented before the Commission of Inquiry revealed that,"
"after meetings with these state bank officials, the petitioner moved into an"
"apartment (penthouse) where the rent was paid by the owners of Perpetual"
"Treasuries  Ltd.,  the  primary  dealer.  This  apartment  was  subsequently"
"purchased by a company named Global Transportation and Logistics (Pvt)"
"Ltd., which is owned and controlled  by members of the petitionerâ€™s  family."
"The owner of the apartment, Anika Wijesuriya, gave evidence regarding this"
"matter."
"The approach of the Court of Appeal"
"I do not intend, for the purposes of this appeal, to scrutinise in detail all the"
"evidence  (direct and circumstantial) led before  the Commission  of Inquiry,"
"or the observations, assertions, findings, or recommendations made by the"
"Commission against the petitioner. However, in view of the material elicited"
"thus  far,  the  approach  adopted  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  this  matter is"
"untenable. The Court of Appeal states:"
"It is abundantly clear that the Commission of Inquiry has not made an"
"expressed recommendation or direction against the Petitioner under the"
"said  Chapters  32  and  33,  although,  the  Commission of  Inquiry  has"
"expressed an opinion that the Commission to Investigate Allegations of"
"Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC)  should examine as  mentioned above"
"whether  appropriate  actions  should  be  taken  against  the  Petitioner"
"under the Bribery Act. The other opinion expressed by the Commission"
