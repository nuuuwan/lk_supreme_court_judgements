"22"
"Judicial  review  may  be  sought  through  prerogative  remedies  such  as"
"certiorari,  prohibition,  procedendo,  mandamus,  and  quo  warranto,  on"
"several grounds conveniently summarised by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil"
"[1985]  AC  374  at  410 
Service  Unions  v.  Minister  for  the  Civil  Service"
"(commonly  referred  to as  the  GCHQ case),  namely: illegality, irrationality,"
"and  procedural 
impropriety.  As  Lord  Diplock  himself  observed, 
this"
"categorisation 
is  not  exhaustive  but  was 
intended  as  a  framework  of"
"convenience.  He  further  noted  that  he  had  in  mind,  in  particular,  the"
"potential 
future  recognition  of 
the  principle  of  proportionality  as  an"
"additional ground of judicial review."
"Lord Diplock  sought to explain the meaning he attributed to those terms."
"Briefly put, illegality refers to decisions made ultra vires or in breach of legal"
"requirements or mala fide; irrationality concerns decisions  so arbitrary and"
"unreasonable  that  no  reasonable  decision-maker,  properly  directing  his"

"impropriety  encompasses 
failures  to  comply  with  mandatory  procedural"
"requirements or breaches of the principles  of natural justice."
"Courts exercise caution in reviewing prosecutorial discretion"
"In  general terms,  the  above  grounds  are  applicable  when  challenging  the"
"prosecutorial discretion  of the Attorney General by way of  judicial review."
"However, as the Court of Appeal has rightly observed  in its judgment, “the"
"judicial review  applications  challenging  the  prosecutorial discretion of  the"
"Attorney General has to be examined very carefully”, and not as a matter of"
"routine. If every accused,  upon the filing of an indictment, is entitled as of"
"right  to  invoke  the  writ  jurisdiction  to  challenge  the  Attorney  General’s"
"discretion  or  the  manner 
in  which 
it  was  exercised, 
the  prosecutorial"
"process  would  be 
exposed 
to  repeated 
collateral  attacks,  ultimately"
"undermining public confidence  in the justice system. The  Court of Appeal"
"has acknowledged this concern when it stated, “I am aware that the Attorney"
