"Sri Lanka between 01.02.2015  and 31.03.2016, 
is widely regarded  as the"
"most serious financial scandal in the history of the country. The  resultant"
"economic  loss  to the  Government  and the  public  is estimated  to run into"
"several billions of rupees, thereby causing substantial harm to the national"
"economy and public trust in financial governance.  These events triggered a"
"widespread public outcry."
"On  the  one  hand,  pursuant  to  a  written  complaint  made  by  the  then"
"Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, on 25.11.2016,"
"the Criminal Investigation Department of the Sri Lanka Police  commenced"
"a  criminal  investigation.  On  the  other  hand,  given  the  magnitude  and"
"complexity  of  the  issue,  the  then  President  of  the  Republic  appointed  a"
"Presidential Commission of Inquiry under section 2 of the Commissions of"
"Inquiry Act, No. 17 of 1948,  as amended,  comprising two sitting Judges of"
"the Supreme Court and a retired Deputy Auditor General, with a mandate"
"to investigate,  inquire into,  and report  on the  issuance  of  treasury bonds"
"during  the  relevant  period.  The  final  report  of  the  Commission  (P4)  was"
"handed over to the President on 30.12.2017  and has since remained in the"
"public  domain.  The  President,  inter  alia,  referred  the  final  report  to  the"
"Attorney General for advice and appropriate action."
"Initially,  the  Criminal 
Investigation  Department  reported 
facts  to 
the"
"Magistrate’s Court of Fort in Case No. B/16089/2020,  implicating several"
"individuals  as suspects,  including the  Minister of  Finance  at the material"
"time,  namely  Ravi  Karunanayake.  Ravi  Karunanayake  succeeded 
in"
"obtaining a writ of certiorari from the Court of Appeal quashing the arrest"
"warrant issued  against him by  the  Fort Magistrate’s Court, in a  separate"
"writ application."
"Thereafter,  the  Attorney  General,  under  his  hand,  exhibited  information"
"dated 11.02.2021  to the High Court of Colombo (P10), comprising 26 typed"
"pages, in terms of section 450(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No."
