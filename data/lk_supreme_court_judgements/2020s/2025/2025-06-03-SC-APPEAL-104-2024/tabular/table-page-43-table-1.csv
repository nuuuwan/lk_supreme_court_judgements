"SC/APPEAL/104/2024"
"43"
"criminal proceedings  under section  24 of  the Commissions  of Inquiry Act."
"With respect,  I am unable to agree with this reasoning."
"Firstly, no copy of the proceedings,  if any, instituted by the Commission to"
"Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption has been  tendered  to this"
"Court,  thereby  precluding 
this  Court 
from  ascertaining  whether  such"
"proceedings  have 
in 
fact  been 
initiated,  and 
if  so,  on  what  charges."
"Secondly,  notwithstanding the possibility that proceedings  may have been"
"instituted  under  the  Bribery  Act  in  relation  to  the  apartment  issue,  the"
"Attorney  General 
is  not  precluded 
from  relying  on  the  same  items  of"
"evidence,  together with other material, to support the proof of distinct and"
"separate charges in the indictment filed before the Trial-at-Bar."
"It must be emphasised that the charges framed against the petitioner in the"
"indictment are not based on the apartment transaction, but arise from other"
"incidents involving alleged criminal misconduct, which are entirely separate"
"and  independent  of  the  matter referred  to the  Commission  to  Investigate"
"Allegations  of  Bribery  or  Corruption.  It  is  also  relevant  to  note  that  the"
"petitioner  did  not  allege  that  the  principle  of  double  jeopardy  had  been"
"violated by the Attorney General."
"The  Court of  Appeal  has  referred  to several  legal principles  such  as “due"
"process” and the “no evidence  rule” in support of its conclusion. However, I"
"find 
it  difficult 
to  understand  how  those  principles  are  meaningfully"
"connected  to  the  facts  of  this  case.  This 
is  the  concluding  part  of  the"
"judgment of the Court of Appeal."
