"Grounds of review identified by the Court of Appeal"
"The Court of Appeal in the impugned decision has enumerated the following"
"grounds  upon  which 
the  Attorney  General’s  decision 
to 
forward  an"
"indictment may be challenged by way of judicial review:"
"(1)  Whether mere objective of leading evidence for the prosecution in"
"the trial court is not for the purpose of establishing the ingredients"
"of the charge against the accused."
"(2)  Whether leading evidence for the prosecution in the trial court;"
"(i) 
Cannot  establish  the  ingredients  of  the  charge  due  to  any"
"restrictions of a written law."
"(ii)  Will  not  be  sufficient  for  the  Trial  Judge  efficaciously and"
"adequately  determine  any  primary  issue  with  mixed facts"
"and law or an issue of law."
"(3) 
Applicability 
of 
the 
‘No 
evidence 
rule’ 
in 
exceptional"
"circumstances."
"(4) 
If 
the  Attorney  General  has 
taken  a  decision  assuming  a"
"jurisdiction which he does not have or exceeding his jurisdiction."
"(5) 
If 
the  Attorney  General  has 
taken  a  decision  exercising  his"
"prosecutorial  discretion  in  bad  faith/mala  fide  or  with  ulterior"
"motive or with political motivation."
"(6) 
The decision would amount to an abuse of process."
"(7) 
Procedural  irregularity  or  existence of  any  illegality  during  the"
"decision making process."
"(8) 
If there is a clear miscarriage of justice."
"It  appears  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  considered 
the  Attorney  General’s"
"discretion in the present case to be amenable to review under grounds (1),"
"2(i), and (3) above. In addition, the Court seems to have taken the view that"
"the  failure  to  adhere  to  “due  process”  constitutes  a  further  ground  that"
