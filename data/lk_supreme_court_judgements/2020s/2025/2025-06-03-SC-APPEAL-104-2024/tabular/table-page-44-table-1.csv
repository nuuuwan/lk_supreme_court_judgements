"under section 24 of the COI Act. The 1st respondent is unsuccessful in"
"establishing  before  this  Court  the  fact  that  the  1st  respondent  has"
"followed such due process for him to be satisfied upon the availability"
"of adequate material and evidence particularly against the Petitioner."
"This requirement will be certainly different if the COI has made clear"
"and express pronouncements in respect of persons who are implicated"
"in  the  matter  under  inquiry  or  any  other  appropriate  persons under"
"section 16 of the COI Act. I am highly influenced in this regard by the"

such  assertions  or"
"observations  cannot  be  considered  ‘material’  as 
intended  by 
the"
"legislature in the said Section 24 of the COI Act."
"In  view of my above findings and  based on special circumstances of"
"this case, I am of the opinion that the mere leading of evidence for the"
"Prosecution against  the  Petitioner in  the Trial Court  cannot  establish"
