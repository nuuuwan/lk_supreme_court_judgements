    "text": "Argued on: 12.11.2024 Decided on: 23.07.2025 Murdu N.B. Fernando, PC. CJ., This is an Appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 17th January 2011. Introduction The Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant (the Plaintiff/ the Appellant) instituted a Partition Action in the District Court of Horana in May 1986 against the Defendant-Respondent-Respondents and moved for partitioning of the land Indigahagodalla in the village of Labugama, in extent 4A 0R 29P depicted in the schedule to the plaint. The plaint bears out that the original owner became entitled to the said land upon a Crown Grant dated 12th September 1883. The Plaintiff pleaded, the partitioning of the said land was necessitated in view of the 2nd Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (the 2nd Defendant / the Respondent) disturbing the possession of the land enjoyed by the Plaintiff and pleaded that the Plaintiff is entitled to 87/288 shares of the land (80 perches) whilst the 2nd Defendant is only entitled to 24/288 shares of the land described above. The case of the Plaintiff was that one Arnolis, son of the original Crown grantee became entitled to 7/12 shares of the instant land. This position is admitted by the Defendants. The Defendants challenge is to the share devolvement thereafter. The said Arnolis by a Deed bearing No. 19977 dated 03.01.1906 P15 conveyed his interest to three others, which conveyance will be discussed in detail later in this judgement. In brief, the matter in issue, is whether Arnolis by the aforesaid deed P15, conveyed to each recipient, 1/3 of his share or 1/3 of his total entitlement which is 7/12 shares of the land referred to in the plaint (the contention put forward by the 2nd Defendant) OR whether all three recipients in common were conveyed 1/3 of his share or 1/3 of Arnoliss entitlement of 7/12 shares, leaving 2/3 of his share unallotted (the contention put forward by the Plaintiff). The pedigree filed of record indicates that undivided portions of the land referred to above had been conveyed, to the Plaintiffs, 1st and 2nd Defendants and others by notarial conveyances.",

This is the pivotal issue before this Court for determination in this Appeal. The learned trial judge did not accept the Plaintiffs contention and gave judgement endorsing the interpretation favourable to the 2nd Defendant and held, that by deed P15 each of the three recipients respectively, became entitled to 1/3 each of Arnoliss total entitlement, which is 7/12 share of the land in extent 4A 0R 19P, more fully referred to in the schedule to the plaint, leaving no residue to pass down though inheritance. Hence, no rights devolved on the Plaintiff, through P16 and P17 the two deeds executed in the year 1980. Therefore, the learned trial judge did not allocate shares based upon such pedigree and chain of title to the Plaintiff.",

Ref: Dona Lucihamy v Ciciliyanahamy 59 NLR 214; Somawathie v Evgin SC/App/ 162/2012 - S.C.M. 29-06-2017 and Acland Insurance Services Limited v P.B. Jayasundara SC/CHC/App 44/2012 S.C.M. 07.07.2025. Whilst I appreciate the judicial dicta laid down in the above referred judgements, that it is the duty of the judge to answer all issues raised at the trial and that bare answers to issues without reasons are not in compliance with the requirements of Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code, upon reading of the instant trial court judgement, it is evident that the learned trial judge, has reviewed and examined the eleven points of contention. These points of contention are all in connection with the pedigree and devolution of title and share distribution. In the light of the totality of evidence led, the trial judge has considered each and every deed marked and produced. Thus, in my view, the learned trial judge has come to a correct finding in relation to share devolution. If I am very specific, there were no legal issues raised at the trial. All issues were based on facts. Whilst issues one to four were raised by the Plaintiff, issues five to eleven were raised by the 2nd Defendant. If I may refer to the issues individually, issues one and two relate to the deeds P15 and P18. Issue three, refers to inheritance rights and issue four to the Plaintiffs rights through inheritance. Similarly, of the issues raised by the 2nd Defendant, issues five and six pertain to deed P15. Issues seven and eight relate to the 2V1 and 2V2. Issue nine relates to deeds 2V3 and 2V4. Issue ten refers to rights to devolve on the 2nd Defendant and issue eleven pertains to cultivation and improvements which also have been granted by the trial judge in the share devolution. Thus, all issues refer to deeds which have being exhaustively dealt within the body of the judgement of the trial court and the consequential issues, pertains to the Plaintiffs and the 2nd Defendants entitlement. It is also noteworthy to state that the Plaintiff went before the Court of Appeal only in respect of the misinterpretation of the deed P15, executed in the year 1906 and not in respect of non answering of issues, which is the 4th question of law raised before this Court. As discussed earlier, the misinterpretation of the deed P15 as alleged by the Plaintiff, gave rise to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd questions of law, which I have answered in favour of the Respondent and against the Appellant. This Court in Mary Nona v. Don Justin and others SC/App 174/2010, S.C.M. 08.06.2016 categorically held that in view of the responsibility bestowed upon a trial judge in",

    "text": "Moreover, considering that the appeal revolves around the interpretation of the deed P15, I am of the view that prejudice has not been caused to the Appellant by non - answering of issues, specifically in the given circumstances of this case. Further, on the facts of this appeal, non answering of issues can be distinguished from the norm, especially in view of the fact, that this is a Partition Action and the onus of the judge is somewhat different to the other kinds of cases, that usually come before a civil court, as held by this Court in Mary Nona case referred to earlier. In any event, upon perusal of the judgement, it is evident that the learned trial judge has examined and analysed the share devolvement in great detail, which has not been challenged by any of the parties except the Plaintiff. In the said circumstances, non answering of issues itself, cannot be considered a ground to allow this Appeal and to set aside the judgement of the trial court and the Court of Appeal. I wish to emphasise at this juncture, that when the Plaintiff went before the Court of Appeal, by the Petition of Appeal itself, the scope of the appeal was limited to the interpretation of the deed P15 only, although before this Court, the scope of challenge has been expanded. In the aforesaid circumstances, I answer the 4th question of law also in favour of the Respondent. Conclusion I have considered the facts of the instant case, the evidence led, the devolvement of shares, P15 the deed in issue, and the submissions of the learned Counsel made before this Court. For reasons adumbrated in this judgement, I am of the view that the Appellant has failed to establish his contention before this Court. Thus, I hold that the Appellants Appeal has no merit and should be dismissed with costs. In the aforesaid circumstance, I answer all four question of law in favour of the Respondents. I affirm the judgement of the Court of Appeal dated 17th January 2011 and the judgement of the District Court of Horana dated 3rd July, 1996.",
