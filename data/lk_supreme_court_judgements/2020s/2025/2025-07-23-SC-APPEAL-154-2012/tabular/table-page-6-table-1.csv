"Factual Matrix"
"- The original owner was bestowed the Crown Grant in 1883 and conveyed his title to"
"his  two  sons,  Arnolis  and  Thegis  in  equal  shares.  Thegis  who  was  unmarried"
"conveyed his entitlement to third parties by way of deeds. Upon Thegis’s death, the"
"balance unconveyed entitlement to the land devolved on Arnolis, entitling Arnolis to"
"7/12 shares of the land referred to in the schedule to the plaint. These matters are not"
"in dispute;"
"-
 in 1906, Arnolis who had title to 7/12 share of the land in extent 4A 0R 29P, upon the"
"afore stated deed P15, conveyed his interest, to three parties, namely, Nomis, Themis"
"and Liveris. The recitals of the deed P15 narrate, that Nomis was Arnolis’s  minor"
"son, whereas Themis and Liveris were Arnolis’s nephews;"
"-
 Thereafter in the year 1937, two of the said parties, Nomis and Themis by Deed No."
"11835 dated 05-08-1937 2V1 conveyed their shares to Liveris. Thus, Liveris became"
"entitled to the full share originally held by Arnolis and which devolved upon Nomis,"
"Themis and Liveris by the deed P15;"
"-
 On the same date by Deed No. 283 2V2, Liveris gifted his entitlement to his daughter"
"Piyaseeli Premalatha and to Willy Weerakoon betrothed to her;"
"-
 The 1st Defendant claims title through Piyaseeli Premalatha (Liveris’s daughter) and"
"such title is not challenged in this appeal;"
"-
  Willy  Weerakoon  (Piyaseeli  Premalatha’s  husband)  conveyed  his  title  to  his  sons,"
"Wijaya  Weerakoon  and  Abaya  Weerakoon  by  way  of  two  deeds  2V3  and  2V4."
"Wijaya Weerakoon is the 2nd Defendant before the trial court and on whose favour"
"the learned trial judge construed the deed P15; and"
"-
 Abaya Weerakoon transferred part of his share to the Plaintiff by P18 and part to the"
"1st Defendant. That chain of title is also not challenged in this appeal."
