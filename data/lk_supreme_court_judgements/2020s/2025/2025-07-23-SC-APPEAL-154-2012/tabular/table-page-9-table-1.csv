"entitlement of Arnolis i.e., (7/12 shares to the three grantees Nomis, Themis and Liveris) which"
"was  made  in  the  year  1906,  through  P15  a  century  back.  Therefore,  it  was  argued  by  the"
"Respondent, that the contention of the learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant, is not"
"tenable in law and is erroneous and thus, should be rejected."
"I
 see merit in the said submissions of the Respondent. I also have no hesitation to accept"
"the contention of the Respondent that the words “ ug whs;s fkdfnomq ;=fkka mx.=j” and"
"the evidence of the 2nd Defendant referred to earlier, which was not challenged by the Plaintiff"
"in cross examination, clearly denotes that Arnolis’s intention by P15, was to convey his full"
"entitlement  of  shares,  to  the  three  grantees  referred  to  therein.  Thus,  no  shares  or  share"
"entitlement was left over, to be devolved on inheritance rights as alleged by the Appellant."
"M
oreover, there was no evidence led before, the trial court by the Plaintiff to establish"
"that Arnolis had a daughter or 2/3 shares of Arnolis’s purported share entitlement devolved on"
"Arnolis’s  daughter  Manchi  Nona  or  her  descendants  on  inheritance  rights.  It  was  only"
"Plaintiff’s  surmise  and  conjecture  before  this  Court.  In  any  event,  the  Plaintiff  when  he"
"obtained title to a particular lot of land by P18 accepted and admitted that the genesis of the"
"chain  of  title  in  the  said  deed  flows  from  the  fact  that  Arnolis  transferred  his  entire  share"
"entitlement to the three grantees therein, by P15 in the year 1906. Thus, in my view the Plaintiff"
"cannot approbate and reprobate, claiming title to one lot of land on P18 upon the basis of a"
"chain of title that recognize Arnolis’s entire share entitlement was conveyed by P15 and, claim"
"title to two other lots of land by P16 and P17 upon the purported basis of inheritance rights"
"through Manchi Nona, when in fact such a chain of title is not in existence nor established by"
"evidence."
"I
 also observe, the learned trial judge has given much weightage and  considered the"
"words, “ ug whs;s fkdfnomq ;=fkka mx.=j” in P15. He has also examined the admissions"
"recorded  by  the  Plaintiff  and  the  2nd  Defendant  before  the  trial  court  that  Arnolis  had  7/12"
"shares  of  the  land  referred  to  in  the  schedule  to  the  plaint,  in  coming  to  his  finding  on  the"
"devolvement of shares."
"T
he  learned  judge  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  too,  categorically  held  that  the  language"
"employed by the grantor in P15 clearly establishes that the grantor was dealing with his total"
"share entitlement and not a specific proportion of his entitlement and the learned trial judge’s"
"construction of P15 is absolutely rational and logical and involves no error or misdirection."
"T
hus, I see no reason to interfere with the said findings of the Court of Appeal and the"
"trial court regarding the factual matrix."
