"a Partition Action, the onus of the judge is somewhat different than any other kind of case, viz.,"
"money  recovery,  divorce,  rent  and  ejectment,  debt  recovery,  contractual,  delictual  etc.,"
"especially in instances in which the judge is expected to sort out shares of the land to be granted"
"to the parties and calculate the share entitlement."
"In the aforesaid circumstances, although it is apparent that the trial judge did not answer"
"the  eleven  issues  raised  between  parties,  when  reading  the  judgement,  itâ€™s  seen  that  all  the"
"points of contention have been answered in the body of the judgement."
"Moreover, considering that the appeal revolves around the interpretation of the deed"
"P15, I am of the view that prejudice has not been caused to the Appellant by non - answering"
"of  issues,  specifically  in  the  given  circumstances  of  this  case.  Further,  on  the  facts  of  this"
"appeal, non answering of issues can be distinguished from the norm, especially in view of the"
"fact, that this is a Partition Action and the onus of the judge is somewhat different to the other"
"kinds of cases, that usually come before a civil court, as held by this Court in Mary Nona case"
"referred to earlier."
"In any event, upon perusal of the judgement, it is evident that the learned trial judge has"
"examined and analysed the share devolvement in great detail, which has not been challenged"
"by any of the parties except the Plaintiff. In the said circumstances, non answering of issues"
"itself, cannot be considered a ground to allow this Appeal and to set aside the judgement of the"
"trial court and the Court of Appeal. I wish to emphasise at this juncture, that when the Plaintiff"
"went before the Court of Appeal, by the Petition of Appeal itself, the scope of the appeal was"
"limited  to  the  interpretation  of  the  deed  P15  only,  although  before  this  Court,  the  scope  of"
"challenge has been expanded."
"In the aforesaid circumstances, I answer the 4th question of law also in favour of the"
"Respondent."
