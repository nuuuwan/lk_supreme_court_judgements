"Court. The trial judge allotted shares to the said parties too, and such allotment is not a fact in"
"dispute in this appeal.)"
"T
he 7/12 share entitlement of Arnolis passed on to the three grantees, Nomis, Themis"
"and Liveris by P15 and such status-quo, continued for 30 years i.e., from 1906 to 1937. In the"
"year 1937, two of the grantees (Nomis and Themis) by deed 2V1 transferred their shares to"
"Liveris,  the  third  grantee  in  P15,  entitling  Liveris,  an  original  grantee,  and  a  newphew  of"
"Arnolis, to the full contingent of 7/12 share entitlement or rights held by the original grantor"
"Arnolis."
"L
iveris  as  discussed  earlier  conveyed  his  shares  to  Piyaseeli  Premalatha  and  Willy"
"Weerakoon by deed 2V2. They are the parents of the 1st and 2nd Defendants. Thus, it is clearly"
"seen that the rights accrued to the 1st and 2nd Defendant’s being the direct descendants of the"
"grantor  Arnolis  and  also  the  rights  devolved  on  the  Plaintiff  from  2nd  Defendant’s,  sibling"
"through  P18  all  flow  from  the  same  point.  i.e.,  this  chain  of  title,  which  is  admitted  and"
"accepted by all parties and especially the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant."
"T
he challenge of the Defendant is only to the purported rights, the Plaintiff is claiming,"
"based upon the other alleged chain of title. As discussed earlier, this chain of title purports to"
"flow through Manchi Nona alleged to be a daughter of Arnolis, but about whom or of such"
"fact, no evidence whatsoever (documentary or oral) was led at the trial."
"I
t’s a matter of concern and I say ironic, that the only recital in the two deeds P16 and"
"P17 executed on 10-04-1980 (from which the Plaintiff claims title through inheritance rights)"
"does not refer to Arnolis or to the Crown Grant. It does not indicate the manner upon which"
"the rights were bestowed upon the conveyor or the transferors or the grantors of P16 and P17."
"It’s silent on the 2/3 share as alleged by the Plaintiff, which was purported to be the remainder,"
"after  1/3  share  was  transferred  through  P15.  It  does  not  state  the  grantors  relationship  to"
"Arnolis. It does not refer to a single notarially executed deed or deed of declaration. Recitals"
"are plain, bare and devoid of any material information. The grantors named therein, only states"
"‘rights  which  we  receive  through  maternal  and  paternal  inheritance’,  which  in  my  view  is"
"sparce and insufficient to claim a right."
"P
aradoxically in 1995, (the Plaintiff who is said to have received title to a portion of"
"land through P16 and P17 discussed above), in his evidence states that Arnolis had a daughter"
"and  that  2/3  shares  of  Arnolis’s  share  entitlement,  devolved  through  the  daughter  to  the"
"grantors of P16 and P17. It’s observed this evidence relating to Arnolis, is given ninety years"
"after execution of P15 by a third party, who is not a relative nor a direct descendent of Arnolis"
"whereas, the 2nd Defendant, a direct descendent of Arnolis, specifically gives evidence that the"
"total 7/12 shares devolved on Liveris, his grandfather. The learned judge after weighing the"
"evidence led, at the trial, held that the Plaintiff’s version cannot be accepted in so far as the 2nd"
"chain of title is concerned and, refrained from granting shares based on such chain of title."
"C
oincidentally,  the  Plaintiff  by  one  chain  of  title  admits  that  Arnolis  transferred  his"
"entire share entitlement to the three grantees referred to in P15, namely, Nomis, Themis and"
