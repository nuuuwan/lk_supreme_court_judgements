"Liveris and by another purported chain of title, the Plaintiff claims that Arnolis had a daughter"
"et al and since only 1/3 share of Arnolis’s entitlement passed through P15, the descendants of"
"the daughter et al who received 2/3 share, conveyed their shares to the Plaintiff by deed P16"
"and P17. As discussed earlier these two deeds do not refer to Arnolis nor to Crown Grant nor"
"to Arnolis’s 2/3 share entitlement. Thus, the Plaintiffs version is not established by evidence"
"and appears to be conjecture only."
"T
herefore, in  my view,  the findings of the learned trial judge based on a balance of"
"probability of the evidence led, is correct and justified. Thus, the version of the Plaintiff in the"
"context of the surrounding facts is inconsistent, absurd, illogical and unbelievable."
"I
n  our  law,  when  interpreting  a  deed,  the  duty  of  court  is  to  interpret  it  as  was"
"understood at the time  of execution by the parties concerned. The deed has to be read as a"
"whole and the spirit of it should be taken note of when arriving at its interpretation."
"I
n a deed, if the words are clear and precise, such literal and ordinary meaning should"
"be given. If such literal meaning leads to absurdity and inconsistency, an interpretation to avoid"
"such absurdity and inconsistency should be given."
"W
hen applying the aforestated principles to the Appeal before this Court, it is apparent"
"that  the  learned  trial  judge  has  categorically  considered  the  words  in  the  deed  P15  and  the"
"evidence led and based on a balance of probability has not accepted the version of the Plaintiff,"
"with regard to the second chain of title."
"T
he  learned  trial  judge  nevertheless,  having  examined  the  chain  of  title  and  being"
"satisfied of same, allotted shares correctly, as morefully disclosed in the judgement."
"I
t is also observed that the learned trial judge, though he did not re-produce the issues"
"or answer the issues one by one, in a twelve page judgement, has considered each and every"
"link of the pedigree and thereby answered all points of contention in the body of the judgement."
"Based upon such entitlement, the learned trial judge referred the distribution and devolment of"
"the shares, on all parties entitled to the shares in partitioning the land referred to in the plaint."
"T
he learned judge of the Court of Appeal considered the question raised as regard to"
"the interpretation of a deed and being satisfied that the trial judge has investigated the title to"
"the land, properly and correctly, came to the conclusion that the trial judge’s construction of"
"P15 is absolutely rational and logical."
"I
n the said circumstances, I answer the 1st, 2nd and 3rd questions in the negative and in"
"favour of the 2nd Defendant-Respondent."
