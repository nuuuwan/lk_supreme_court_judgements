"- Secondly, the Plaintiff claims title, purportedly emanating from the inheritance rights"
"of Arnolis’s descendants by two deeds P16 and P17 executed on 20-04-1980. (This chain of"
"title is contentious and is disputed by the Defendants)."
"I
n order to substantiate the position pertaining to the inheritance rights of Arnolis and"
"the chain of title derived from P16 and P17, the Plaintiff is relying on the construction of the"
"deed P15 referred to earlier. i.e., only 1/3 share was conveyed by Arnolis through P15, leaving"
"an unalloted 2/3  share  with Arnolis, which was conveyed by inheritance rights. This is the"
"pivotal issue before this Court for determination in this Appeal."
"The learned trial judge  did not accept the Plaintiff’s  contention and  gave judgement"
"endorsing the interpretation favourable to the 2nd Defendant and held, that by deed P15 each"
"of the three recipients respectively, became entitled to 1/3 each of Arnolis’s total entitlement,"
"which is 7/12 share of the land in extent 4A 0R 19P, more fully referred to in the schedule to"
"the plaint, leaving no residue to pass down though inheritance. Hence, no rights devolved on"
"the Plaintiff, through P16 and P17 the two deeds executed in the year 1980. Therefore, the"
"learned trial judge did not allocate shares based upon such pedigree and chain of title to the"
"Plaintiff."
"The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court judgment and the construction adopted by"
"the trial judge regarding the deed P15. The learned Judge of the Court of Appeal noted that the"
"scope of the Petition of Appeal filed by the Plaintiff before the Court of Appeal, was limited"
"to the alleged misconstruction of the deed P15. Therefore the Court of Appeal judgement, only"
"considered and dealt with the legal provisions relating to the construction of P15 executed in"
"the year 1906. The Court of Appeal did not examine the share devolution."
"Being aggrieved by the said decision of the Court of Appeal, the Plaintiff is before this"
"Court having obtained Leave to Appeal on the following matters as referred to in verbatim in"
"sub paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of paragraph 14 of the Petition of Appeal."
"1.  Deed No. 19977 of 03.01.1906 has not been correctly construed by the District Court"
"and the Court of Appeal."
"2.  Due to the misinterpretation of Deed No. 19977 of 03.01.1906 the District Court and"
"the Court of Appeal have erred in allocating the correct shares to the parties concerned."
"3.  The District Court judgment is erroneous since it is stated that Abaya Weerakoon’s sale"
"of 80  perches out of the 7/48 shares he got  on Deed P18 proves the contention that"
"Arnolis had sold all his rights on P15 and not only 1/3. However, the fact that Abaya"
"Weerakoon has got shares not only from Willy Weerakoon on Deed 2V3 but also on"
"Deed 1V2 which enabled him to sell 80 perches to the Plaintiff has not been considered."
"4.  The District Court erred in not answering the issues raised by parties."
"Whilst the aforesaid 1st, 2nd and 3rd questions relate to the interpretation of a clause in"
"the deed P15, the 4th question relates to a legal issue."
