Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f and 6h substituted-

defendant-appellant-appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 6th

defendant) on the basis of being aggrieved of the judgment pronounced by

the Court of Appeal on 20-02-2014, whereby the appeal preferred by them

was dismissed and the judgment pronounced by the learned District Judge

of Colombo on 16-04-1999 was affirmed.

When this matter was supported for Special Leave to Appeal on 21-01-2016,

this Court, by a majority decision, granted Leave to Appeal on the questions

of law as set out in paragraph 19.2, 19.3, 19.4, and 19.5 of the petition

dated 02-04-2014.

Page 16 of 26

The said questions of law read as follows,

1. Has His Lordship erred in law by failing to consider the principle of

ouster in relation to prescription as clearly established by the

evidence in the case, showing that the 6th defendant had in fact

established such ouster and undisturbed possession of more than

10 years of the land in suit.

2. Has His Lordship erred in law by not correctly applying the

principles laid down in the cases of Corea Vs. Appuhami 15 NLR 65,

Brito Vs. Mithunayagam 20 NLR 327, Thilakaratne Vs. Bastian 21

NLR 12, Gunasekara Vs. Thissera (1994) 3 SLR 245, Siyathuhami

Vs. Podi Manike (2004) 2 SLR 325, Rajapakshe Vs. Hendrick Singho

61 NLR 32 and Karunawathie Vs. Gunadasa (1996) 2 SLR 406.

3. Has His Lordship erred in law by not accepting the finding of the

learned District Judge that there was a dispute regarding the

survey of the land by the respondents in the year 1972.

4. Has His Lordship erred in law by disturbing the findings of the

learned District Judge of Colombo when in fact the respondents

had not sought to appeal the said findings of the learned District

Judge.

At the hearing of this appeal, this Court had the benefit of listening to the

submissions of the learned President’s Counsel who represented the

substituted 6th defendant and the learned President’s Counsel who

represented the substituted 1a and 5a defendant-respondent-respondents.

This Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel who represented

2a(1) and 2a(3) substituted defendant-respondent-respondents and 3a

substituted defendant-respondent-respondent as well.

This Court also had the privilege of considering the written submissions

tendered by the parties as to their respective stands.

This is a case where the plaintiff of the action before the District Court

instituted proceedings under the Partition Law to partition the lands

morefully described in the 2nd and 3rd schedule of the plaint dated 16-09-

Page 17 of 26

1987 between the plaintiffs and the defendants mentioned in the plaint. The

above mentioned two lands are lands situated adjacent to each other and

admittedly held and possessed by the original owner under whom the

plaintiff before the District Court has pleaded title as one single unit. In her

plaint, the plaintiff has allocated an undivided 1/8th share of the corpus to

the 6th defendant of the action.

At the trial, there had been no dispute between the parties as to the corpus

to be partitioned and also the undivided rights of the parties as pleaded by

the plaintiff in her plaint. However, the 6th defendant of the action has

claimed title as against the rights of the other co-owners of the land for the

entire corpus sought to be partitioned on the basis of prescription.

According to the evidence led before the trial Court and as correctly

determined by the learned trial Judge who pronounced the judgment, the

admitted original owner of the two lands had transferred his rights by deed

No. 111 (P-04) dated 10-07-1932, to Fedrick Alfred Victor Gunawardena,

Don Elsie Gurtrude Gunawardena, Don Flora Agnes Gunawardena (1st

defendant) and Don Percy Rosmund Gunawardena (plaintiff).

The 2nd defendant named in the plaint is the heir of Elsie Gurtrude

Gunawardena, who became entitled to an undivided 1/4th share of the land

while 3rd, 4th and 5th defendants mentioned in the plaint had been the

children of Victor Gunawardena, who also became entitled to an undivided

1/4th share. They are the children born out of the 1st marriage of the said

Victor Gunawardena. The 6th defendant had been the 2nd married wife of

Victor Gunawardena, while the 7th to 14th defendants are the children born

out of the 2nd marriage of the said Victor Gunawardena.

It is also in evidence that the plaintiff who received a 1/4th undivided share

of the corpus from its original owner is the sister of Victor Gunawardena

under whom the 6th defendant derives rights as the wife of him.

At the trial, the contention of the 6th defendant has been that the plaintiff

and the other co-owners never possessed the land sought to be partitioned

for over 50 years and it was she along with her children and husband who

Page 18 of 26

held it. The mentioned Victor Gunawardena has died in the year 1966. It is

on that basis she has claimed prescriptive title.

In his judgment, the learned District Judge has considered as to how a co-

owner of a land can acquire prescriptive title and has looked whether there

is sufficient evidence to come to a finding that the 6th defendant has proved

the ouster of other co-owners in order to establish her claimed prescription.

Having analysed the evidence led before the Court, the learned District

Judge had come to a finding that the 6th defendant has failed to prove her

claim of prescription, and accordingly, has ordered the partitioning of the

land sought to be partitioned between the plaintiff and the defendants of the

action as stated in the judgment.

At the hearing of the appeal preferred by the 6th defendant challenging the

judgment of the learned District Judge before the Court of Appeal, the 6th

defendant has maintained the same stand that it is she who should be

declared entitled to the corpus sought to be partitioned on the basis that she

has proved prescriptive title to the same.

I find that His Lordship of the Court of Appeal who pronounced the appellate

judgment on 20-02-2014 has considered whether it has been established

that the 6th defendant, being a co-owner, held and possessed the land for

over 10 years adversely to the rights of the other co-owners after having

those other co-owners ousted from the land to be partitioned.

Having considered the relevant facts and circumstances and the law in

relation to several decided cases of our Superior Courts in that regard, His

Lordship of the Court of Appeal has decided to dismiss the appeal for want

of any merit.

However, it clearly appears that while considering the evidence placed before

the trial Courts as to an admission by the 6th defendant in her evidence in

relation to an attempt between the co-owners of the land to amicably

partition the land which was a matter considered by the learned District

Judge as well, it has been determined that the said attempt has been made

between the parties in the year 1977 as borne out by evidence.

Page 19 of 26

This suggests that His Lordship has not agreed with the determination of

the learned District Judge that although the 6th defendant’s evidence which

stated that the year was 1977, it should have been the year 1972. His

Lordship has also considered the fact that the 10th and the 12th defendants

of the action being persons who have built houses within the corpus have

not challenged the District Court judgment, where they have been allocated

shares. It has been viewed that although they are the children of the 6th

defendant, the rights already granted to them will also be affected if the

claim of prescription to the whole land by the 6th defendant is allowed.

Accordingly, the appeal preferred by the 6th defendant has been dismissed

without costs.

At the hearing of this appeal, it was strenuously contended by the learned

President’s Counsel on behalf of the 6th defendant, having cited several

judgments considered by the Court of Appeal, that the 6th defendant has

sufficiently proved her prescriptive claim. It was contended that the Court of

Appeal as well as the District Court has failed to give due consideration to

the relevant case law and the principles laid down as to the ouster and

prescription among co-owners when the case was decided in favour of the

plaintiff, where there was ample evidence before the Court for such a

presumption in favour of the 6th defendant.

The essence of the submissions of the learned President’s Counsel who

represented the 1A and the 5A substituted defendant-respondents and the

other learned Counsel who represented the 2A and 3A substituted

defendant-respondents was that, the prescription among the co-owners is a

matter that has to be established by the party who claimed prescription by

strong evidence of ouster and possession against the rights and interests of

other co-owners for over ten years. It was submitted that the mode of proof

depends on the facts and the circumstances of each case and there cannot

be a strict yardstick in that regard. It was his position that since both the

District Court, as well as the Court of Appeal, have well considered the

relevant circumstances and the law in the respective determinations, the

appeal should stand dismissed.

Page 20 of 26

Having heard the submissions made by the respective parties as to their

stands and the relevant law in mind, I will now proceed to consider whether

there is merit in the appeal before the Court.

In that context, I find it appropriate to consider the questions of law no. 1

and 11 together as they relate to the question of prescription among co-

owners.

The learned President’s Counsel heavily relied on the cases of Corea Vs.

Appuhami (Supra), Thilakaratne Vs. Bastian (Supra) and several other

cases which favour his contention of prescription among co-owners.

Although the case of Corea Vs. Appuhami (Supra) was a case where it was

held that the claimant of prescription had succeeded in his claim; it was a

case where the basic principles as to prescription among co-owners had

been laid down.

It was held:

Possession by a co-heir ensures to the benefit of its co-heirs.

A co-owner’s possession is in law the possession of his co-owners. It is

not possible for him to put an end to that possession by any secret

intention in his mind. Nothing short of ouster or something equivalent

to ouster could bring about that result.

In the case of Thilakaratne Vs. Batian (supra), it was observed;

It is open to the Court, from lapse of time in conjunction with the

circumstances of the case, to presume that a possession originally

that of a co-owner has since become adverse.

“It is a question of fact, wherever long-continued exclusive

possession by one co-owner is proved to have existed, whether it

is not just and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case

that the parties should be treated as though it had been proved

that separate and exclusive possession had become adverse at

some date more than 10 years before action brought.”

Page 21 of 26

Held further,

“What then, is the real effect of the decision in Corea Vs.

Appuhami upon the interpretation of the word ‘adverse’ with

reference to cases of co-ownership? It is, as I understand it, that

for the purpose of these cases the word ‘adverse’ must, in its

application to any particular case be interpreted in the light of

three principles of law:-

(i) Every co-owner having a right to possess and enjoy

the whole property and every part of it, the

possession of one co-owner in that capacity is in law

the possession of all.

(ii) Where the circumstances are such that a man’s

possession may be referrable either to an unlawful

act or to a lawful title, he is presumed to possess by

virtue of the lawful title.

(iii) A person who has entered into possession of land in

one capacity is presumed to continue to possess it in

the same capacity.”

In the case of Karunawathie and Others Vs. Gunadasa (1996) 2 SLR 406,

it was held;

There was overwhelming evidence that the defendants since 1955 took

the produce to the exclusion of the plaintiffs and their predecessors in

title and gave him no share of the produce or paid them a share of the

profits nor any rent and did no act from which as acknowledgement of

a right existing and there would fairly naturally be inferred.

Per Senanayake, J.,

“In considering whether or not a presumption of ouster should be

drawn by reason of long continued possession alone, of the

property owned in common, it is relevant to consider

(a) the income derived from the property

Page 22 of 26

(b) the value of the property

(c) the relationship of the co-owners and where they

reside in relation to the situation of the corpus.”

The above considered judgments as well as a plethora of other judgments of

our Superior Courts have clearly settled the law in relation to the question of

prescription among co-owners, determining that it is a matter that depends

on facts and circumstances unique to each case.

When considering the facts of the case under appeal, it is clear that the

house situated on the land which has been identified as ‘6’ in the

preliminary plan marked ‘X’ has been the ancestral house of the persons

who received rights to the land from the deed marked P-04, being the

children of the original owner. They have been living in the house until they

left the ancestral house due to various events of their life, such as marriage,

settling and starting of their own families elsewhere, etc. It is the husband of

the 6th defendant, namely, Victor Gunawardena who has continued to live in

the house and the land although his other siblings had left the land.

The 6th defendant has been the 2nd wife of said Victor Gunawardena, one of

the children who received rights through P-04.

It has been the position of the 6th defendant that the 1st defendant left the

property after her marriage in the year 1961 and after the death of the

mother of the 2nd defendant, who was one of the children of the original

owner, it is she who held and possessed that land since 1963 without

allowing the co-owners to possess it.

Admittedly, the husband of the 6th defendant has died in the year 1966,

which means if at all, she can only claim prescription against the other co-

owners from the death of her husband. It has been in evidence that

although the brothers and sisters of the husband of the 6th defendant have

left the house and the property, they have maintained their affiliation to the

ancestral house and their brother until his death.

When it comes to the ouster that needs to be established by a co-owner who

claims prescription against the other co-owners, it is well settled law that by

possessing a land, a co-owner cannot claim prescription, but it has to be a

possession that amounts to an ouster of other co-owners.

According to the evidence of the 6th defendant, anything that can be

considered as a thing equivalent to an ouster has occurred only in the year

1977. The 6th defendant has spoken in her evidence about a discussion the

parties to the partition action had in order to divide the land among them,

and of an incident where a surveyor has come to the land in order to survey

the land (page 103, 104, 105 of the appeal brief). The essence of her

evidence shows that the amicable partition has not gone through, because

her children opposed such a partition and because of the fact that she was

in possession since 1944, which was her year of marriage to Victor

Gunawardena.

Although the learned District Judge while analysing the evidence has

determined that the said event has taken place in the year 1972, I find no

basis for such a conclusion. Though the daughter of the 6th defendant who

has given evidence in this action has claimed that the said attempt to

partition the land took place in the year 1972, I find no basis to accept her

evidence as against the evidence of the 6th defendant who is the person who

actually claimed prescriptive rights to the entire corpus. In her evidence, she

has stated unambiguously that the said event took place in the year 1977.

Although the events that have taken place thereafter, according to the

evidence led before the Court, are suggestive of adverse possession and

ouster, in my view, since the partition action was initiated in the year 1987,

there was no basis before the trial Court to conclude that the 6th defendant

held and possessed the corpus of the action by ousting the other co-owners

for more than 10 years for her to claim prescriptive rights to the entire

corpus. What is also clear to me is that the learned District Judge has

correctly considered the evidence of the 6th defendant as to the said year as

1977 in the correct perspective while taking the evidence in its totality to

Page 24 of 26

determine that the required 10-year period has not been established from

the said date.

I find that His Lordship who pronounced the judgment in the Court of

Appeal has well considered the facts as well as the relevant law in affirming

the judgment of the learned District Judge. His Lordship has correctly

determined the ouster, if at all, has taken place after the year 1977 based on

the evidence of the 6th defendant herself and therefore her prescriptive claim

shall fail. It has been correctly held that the long-standing possession would

not in itself amount to establishing prescriptive rights in a co-owned land.

In the above context, I will now proceed to consider whether the 3rd and the

4th questions of law, where it was argued that His Lordship of the Court of

Appeal erred by disturbing the finding of the learned District Judge, that

dispute in relation to the surveying of the land occurred in the year 1972.

The Article 138 of the Constitution is the provision where the jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal has been conferred upon. The relevant Article 138(1)

reads as follows,

138. (1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law, and appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law

which shall be (committed by the High Court in the exercise of its

appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of first

instance), tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive

cognisance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum,

of all courses, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things (of

which such High Court, Court of first instance), tribunal or other

institution may have taken cognisance. (The emphasis is mine).

The above Constitutional provision clearly provides for the Court of Appeal

to correct a factual matter that needs to be corrected when determining an

appeal in that regard. Hence, I find no basis for the 3rd and 4th questions of

law as urged on behalf of the 6th defendant.

Another matter that needs to be emphasized is that this is a trial where

apart from recording the points of contest, the entire evidence has been led

before the same learned District Judge who has pronounced the judgment

where the partitioning of lands sought to be partitioned between the co-

owners was ordered.

It is well settled law that under such circumstances, appellate Courts will be

very slow to interfere with a judgment pronounced by a trial Judge as it is

the trial Judge who has the benefit of hearing and determining the

demeanour and deportment, and also the other relevant matters of evidence

unless the said judgment is not according to the law or can be termed as a

judgment that has not been supported by evidence, and therefore, perverse.

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J. having considered several case laws on this

matter, in the case of Rev. E.H. Palitha and Others Vs. K. Kingsley Perera

SC/Appeal/30/2022 decided on 31-01-2024 observed,

“It is trite law that the findings of fact of the trial Judge who has the

priceless advantage of seeing and hearing witnesses giving evidence,

thereby getting the opportunity to observe inter alia the demeanour and

deportment of witnesses, are regarded as sacrosanct and should not be

lightly disturbed unless there are compelling reasons. There are no live

witnesses before the appellate Court but only printed evidence. It is

important to bear in mind that the trial Judge has the benefit of

assessing the evidence in its overall context to reach the final decision,

unlike the piece meal approach adopted in presenting the case before

the appellate Court.”

Having considered the relevant facts and the circumstances, I am of the view

that the appellate judgment of His Lordship of the Court of Appeal is a

judgment that needs no interference, as it has been reached after having

well considered the facts and the circumstances, and also the relevant law

in its correct perspective.

Accordingly, I answer the four questions of law in the negative and dismiss

the appeal for want of any merit.

The parties shall bear their own costs.
