ARGUED ON: 01st April 2025 and 03rd April 2025

DECIDED ON: 04th April 2025

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

18. The matters before us arise out of several writ and fundamental rights applications filed

before this Court challenging the decisions of Returning Officers of several

Administrative Districts to reject nomination papers tendered by certain recognized

SC Writ 06/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 151 of 162

political groups and independent groups in relation to the local authorities elections to

be held on 06th May 2025.

19. When the matters were called before this Court on 01st April 2025, the learned Deputy

Solicitor General raised a preliminary objection. While this preliminary objection

concerns all the writ matters before this Court, certain matters had to be categorized

and dealt with separately as a matter of practical convenience. For the purpose of

convenient reference, I shall proceed to reproduce the conclusion of this Court with

respect to this preliminary objection in each such categories of cases.

20. When the Petitioners were heard once again on 03rd April 2025, Counsel appearing in

SC Writ Nos. 06/25, 07/25, 10/25, 11/25, 12/25, 13/25, 14/25, 15/25, 16/25, 17/25, 18/25,

19/25, 20/25, 21/25, 22/25, 23/25, 24/25, 25/25, 27/25, 28/25, 29/25, 31/25, 32/25, 34/25,

35/25, 36/25, 37/25, 39/25, 41/25, 42/25, 46/25, 47/25, 49/25, 51/25, 52/25, 53/25, 54/25,

55/25, 56/25, 58/25, 59/25, 60/25, 61/25 and 62/25 agreed to be bound by a single

consolidated judgment on all such applications as the substantive questions raised in

those matters happened to coincide.

21. All such matters essentially related to disqualification of candidates and/or the rejection

of the nomination paper in toto on account of non-compliance with Section 28(4A) of

the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, No. 53 of 1946, as amended by Act, No. 25 of

1990, which requires a certified copy of the birth certificates of youth candidates or an

affidavit certifying the date of birth of such youth candidate to be attached to the

nomination papers.

22. Aggrieved by such rejections, the Petitioners in above applications seek relief from this

Court by way of writ applications under and in terms of Article 140 read with Article

104H of the Constitution, praying for orders in the nature of writ of certiorari and

mandamus.

SC Writ 06/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 152 of 162

PRELIMINARY OBJECTION

23. In respect of all the writ matters filed before this Court, the learned Deputy Solicitor

General raised a preliminary objection contending that Petitioners of these writ matters

ought to have sought relief not from the Supreme Court but from the Court of Appeal

under Article 140 of the Constitution, as what the Petitioners have sought to challenge

by their applications are decisions of Returning Officersas opposed to decisions of the

Election Commission itself.

24. Article 140 of the Constitution provides that,

Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Court of Appeal shall have full

power and authority to inspect and examine the records of any Court of First Instance

or tribunal or other institution and grant and issue, according to law, orders in the

nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto

against the judge of any Court of First Instance or tribunal or other institution or any

other person:

[Provided that Parliament may by law provide that in any such category of

cases as may be specified in such law, the jurisdiction conferred on the Court

of Appeal by the preceding provisions of this Article shall be exercised by the

Supreme Court and not by the Court of Appeal.]1

25. Very clearly, as the proviso hereto sets out, this Court only exercises writ jurisdiction with

respect to such categories of matters that are expressly vested upon it by law, whereas

writ jurisdiction in general is vested with the Court of Appeal.

26. Within Chapter XIV A of the Constitution, which establishes the Election Commission,

Article 104H provides that,

(1) The jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Appeal under Article 140 of the

Constitution shall, in relation to any matter that may arise in the exercise by

the Commission of the powers conferred on it by the Constitution or by any

other law, be exercised by the Supreme Court.

(2) Every application invoking the jurisdiction referred to in paragraph (1), shall be

made within one month of the date of the Commission of the act to which the

application relates. The Supreme Court shall hear and finally dispose of the

application within two months of the filing of the same.2

27. While it may prima facie appear that this Court exercises writ jurisdiction, by virtue of

Article 104H, with respect to all such things coming under the purview of the Election

Commission, the learned Deputy Solicitor General submits this Article to be one that

requires a more nuanced application. It was her submission that the term Commission

in Article 104H referred not to the Commissioner-General nor any other officer of the

Commission but to the Commission itself.

28. In support of her submission, she cited Ghany v. Dayananda Dissanayake,

Commissioner of Elections and Others,3 which I shall advert to later.

29. The impugned decisions to reject nominations were clearly taken by Returning Officers.

It was submitted that such rejections were a specific statutory function independently

exercised by such Returning Officers that does not amount to a decision of the

2 Emphasis added

3 [2004] 1 Sri L.R. 17

SC Writ 06/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 154 of 162

Commission itself. Accordingly, it was submitted that decisions of Returning Officers to

reject nomination based on legal requirements set out in the Local Authorities Elections

Ordinance, No. 53 of 1946 did not fall within the ambit of Article 104H of the

Constitution.

30. Learned Counsel for the Petitioners argued, with reference to Section 4 and 5 of the

Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, No. 53 of 1946, that Returning Officers are

appointed as agents of the Commission to carry out the functions of the Commission in

each of the districts. To this end, they further highlighted the fact that Returning Officers

so appointed are answerable to the Commission in terms of Article 104F and 104G of

the Constitution.

31. Section 4 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance provides that,

(1) The Commissioner may appoint by name or by office for each district in Sri Lanka,

a fit and proper person to be or to act as district returning officer and one other

person to be or to act as the returning officer for each of the local authority area

or of any particular local authority, as the case may be, in a district, and such

number of other persons as may become necessary to be or to act as assistant

returning officers for that district.

(2) There may also be appointed such clerical and minor staff as maybe necessary to

assist the aforesaid officers in the performance of their duties under this

Ordinance.

(3) Every person appointed under the preceding provisions of this section shall be

deemed for all purposes to be a public servant and shall be paid such salary and

allowances out of the Consolidated Fund as may be determined or approved by

the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister in charge of the subject of

Finance.

SC Writ 06/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 155 of 162

32. Whereas Section 5 of the Ordinance provides that

(1) In the exercise or performance of the powers or duties conferred or imposed by

this Ordinance each elections officer shall be subject to the general supervision

and control of the Commissioner.

(2) Subject to the general supervision and control of the Commissioner, each assistant

returning officer and assistant elections officer may exercise or perform the powers

or duties conferred or imposed by this Ordinance upon an election officer.

33. While the abovementioned provisions of the Act only establish supervision and control

of the Commissioner, the Constitution under Articles 104F and 104G very clearly sets out

that Returning Officers appointed in terms of the law are responsible and answerable to

the Commission.

34. Article 104F of the Constitution provides,

(1) The Commission shall from time to time by notice published in the Gazette

appoint by name or by office a person to be a Returning Officer to each electoral

district, and may appoint by name or by office one or more persons to assist the

Returning Officer in the performance of his duties.

(2) Every Officer appointed under paragraph (1) shall in the performance and

discharge of such duties and functions as are assigned to him, be subject to such

directions as may be issued by the Commission and shall be responsible and

answerable to the Commission therefor.4

4 Emphasis added

35. Article 104G provides that,

All public officers performing duties and functions at any election or

Referenda shall act in the performance and discharge of such duties and functions

under the directions of the Commission and shall be responsible and

answerable to the Commission therefor.5

36. As to how Article 104G may be interpreted and whether decisions of a Returning Officer

can be regarded as decisions of the Commission itself, as the learned Deputy Solicitor

General submitted, are questions which have already been considered by this Court.

37. A five-judge bench of this Court was previously confronted with these key questions

before us, albeit in a context that is different to some extent. Ghany v. Dayananda

Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and Others6 was an appeal from a writ

application to the Court of Appeal praying for an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari

quashing the declaration of election results, alleging irregularities at the counting of

preferences, and an order in the nature of a writ of mandamus compelling a recount.

The Court of Appeal, on a preliminary objection which contended the exact opposite to

what is contended before us, went on to hold that jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in

relation to matters arising out of the exercise of powers by the Elections Commission as

well as the Election Commissioner had been removed from the Court of Appeal to be

vested in the Supreme Court by virtue of Article 104H of the Constitution.

5 Emphasis added

SC Writ 06/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 157 of 162

38. Delivering the judgment for the Court, Mark Fernando, J, with the concurrence of Ismail,

Edussuriya, Yapa and Wigneswaran, JJ, found the Court of Appeal to have erred in the

said finding.

39. While the Counsel for the Petitioners sought to distinguish the Ghany Case on the basis

that it related to a Returning Officers refusal to recount, and not a rejection of

nominations as with the cases before usarguing that sui juris powers of the Returning

Officer only arise after the closure of the polls, I do not see this distinction as a factor

distinguishing the ratio the Ghany Case from the matters before us. No such distinction

can be identified by the plain reading of Articles 104F and 104G. These two Articles

remain the same throughout. The argument put forward that the Returning Officers sui

juris function arises only after the closure of polls, specifically in relation to counting

votes, announcing results, and filling vacancies as a means of distinguishing Ghany

Case, cannot be accepted. The Ghany Case relates to a decision of a Returning Officer

and the legal questions considered by the Court are substantially the same as what has

been brought before us.

40. The preliminary objection in the Ghany Case, which the Court of Appeal upheldand

the five-judge bench of the Supreme Court rejectedas quoted in the Supreme Court

judgment, reads as follows:

The Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter as in terms

of Article 104H of the Constitution (introduced by the 17th Amendment to the

Constitution) the jurisdiction had been transferred or removed to the Supreme Court

SC Writ 06/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 158 of 162

in relation to matters arising out of the exercise of powers by the Election

Commissioner/Election Commission.7

41. As it is amply clear, this preliminary objection calls the Court to consider questions that

are identical to that which is before us.

42. Fernando, J, in His Lordships judgment, was guided to a great extent by the language

of Article 104A, which contains a limited constitutional ouster clause with respect to

decisions, directions or acts of the Election Commission. Article 104A of the Constitution

is as follows:

Subject to the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court under paragraph (1) of

Article 126, Article 104H and Article 130 and on the Court of Appeal by Article 144

and the jurisdiction conferred on any court by any law to hear and determine election

petitions or Referendum petitions

(a) no court shall have the power or jurisdiction to entertain or hear or decide

or call in question on any ground and in any manner whatsoever, any

decision, direction or act of the Commission, made or done or purported to

have been made or done under the Constitution or under any law relating

to the holding of an election or the conduct of a Referendum as the case

may be, which decisions, directions or acts shall be final and conclusive;

and

(b) no suit or prosecution or other proceeding shall lie against any member or

officer of the Commission for any act or thing which in good faith is done

or purported to be done by him in the performance of his duties or the

7 [2004] 1 Sri L.R. 17, at 20

SC Writ 06/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 159 of 162

discharge of his functions under the Constitution or under any law relating

to the holding of an election or the conduct of a Referendum as the case

may be.

43. Having referred to the same, His Lordship observed that,

This provision draws a sharp distinction between the acts of the Commission and

the acts of its officers. In particular, the latter receive protection only in respect of

acts done in good faith. That distinction militates against any general assumption

that the acts of officers can be equated to, or deemed to be, acts of the Commission.8

44. His Lordship placed further emphasis on the language of Article 104H(1) which refers to

matters that may arise in the exercise by the Commission of the powers conferred on

it

45. It was held that,

Article 104H must be read with Article 104A(a). Read together, those two provisions

manifest a clear intention to transfer to this Court a part of the writ jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal, namely, in relation to any matter arising in the exercise by the

Election Commission of its powers, and also to make decisions, directions and acts of

the Election Commission final and immune from judicial review except under Article

104H, 126(1) and 130. Ex facie, neither Article applies to acts and omissions of

the Commissioner of Elections, or of his officers.

To put it another way, Article 104H effects an ouster of the jurisdiction of the Court

of Appeal only upon an exercise of the powers of the Election Commission, by the

8 [2004] 1 Sri L.R. 17, at 21-22

SC Writ 06/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 160 of 162

Commission itself. Article 104H does not apply to an exercise of the power of

the Election Commission by any other person. The words by the Commission

are words of limitation. If Parliament had intended that Article 104H should also

apply to an exercise of those powers by the commissioner of Elections, it would have

removed those words of limitation, so that Article 104H would have read: in

relation to any matter that may arise in the exercise of the powers conferred on the

Commission by the Constitution or by any other law, omitting the words by the

Commission and on it.

Likewise, Article 104A(a) refers to any decision, direction or act of the Commission,

and not to any decision, direction or act in the exercise of the powers of the

Commission. The plain meaning of those provisions is that there is an ouster of the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal only in respect of an exercise of power by the

Election Commission itself.

To sum up, the subject-matter of the appellants writ application to the Court of

Appeal was mainly, if not entirely, in respect of the alleged acts (and omissions) of

officers of the Commissioner of Elections, and not in relation to decisions, directions,

acts, orders or rulings of the Commissioner of Elections, He did not allege any exercise

(by those officers or by the Commissioner of Elections) of the powers of the Election

Commission. Those acts could not have been regarded ex facie as an exercise of the

powers of the Commissioner of Elections and/or of the Election Commission9

9 [2004] 1 Sri L.R. 17, at 26-29 (Emphasis added)

SC Writ 06/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 161 of 162

46. As it is amply clear from the above judgment, acts of the Commissioner of Elections

himselflet alone that of his subordinate officersare not always referable to the

Commission itself.

47. According to section 31(2) of the Ordinance, the decision of the rejection of a

nomination paper by the returning officer is final and conclusive without any

involvement of the Commission.

31(2) Where any nomination paper has been rejected by the returning officer under

subsection (1), the returning officer shall inform the secretary of the recognized

political party or the group leader, as the case may be, who had submitted such

nomination paper the fact of such rejection. The decision of the returning officer to

reject such nomination paper shall be final and conclusive.

48. Where the Commissioner or any other officer (such as Returning Officers) exercise

powers vested by law in such office they hold, writ jurisdiction in respect of such acts

remain with the Court of Appeal, unaffected by the provisions of Article 104H of the

Constitution. We see no reason to deviate from this five-judge bench decision of this

Court.

CONCLUSION

49. As the preliminary objection raised by the learned Deputy Solicitor General was upheld,

all writ petitions above mentioned are dismissed.

Applications Dismissed.
