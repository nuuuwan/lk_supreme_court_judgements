"PRELIMINARY OBJECTION"
"23. In  respect  of  all  the  writ  matters  filed  before  this  Court,  the  learned Deputy  Solicitor"
"General raised a preliminary objection contending that Petitioners of these writ matters"
"ought to have sought relief not from the Supreme Court but from the Court of Appeal"
"under Article 140 of the Constitution, as what the Petitioners have sought to challenge"
"by their applications are decisions of Returning Officersâ€”as opposed to decisions of the"
"Election Commission itself."
