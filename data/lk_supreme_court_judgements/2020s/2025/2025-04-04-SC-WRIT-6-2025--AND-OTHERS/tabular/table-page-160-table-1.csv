"Commission itself.  Article 104H does not apply to an exercise of the power of"
"the Election Commission  by any other person. The words “by the Commission”"
"are  words  of  limitation.  If  Parliament  had  intended that  Article  104H  should  also"
"apply to an exercise of those powers by the commissioner of Elections, it would have"
"removed  those  words  of  limitation,  so  that  Article  104H  would  have  read:  …  “in"
"relation to any matter that may arise in the exercise of the powers conferred on the"
"Commission by the Constitution or by any other law”, omitting the words “by the"
"Commission” and “on it”."
"Likewise, Article 104A(a) refers to “any decision, direction or act of the Commission”,"
"and  not  to  “any  decision,  direction  or  act  in  the  exercise  of  the  powers  of  the"
"Commission”. The plain meaning of those provisions is that there is an ouster of the"
"jurisdiction  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  only  in  respect  of  an  exercise  of  power  by  the"
"Election Commission itself…."
"To  sum  up,  the  subject-matter of  the  appellant’s  writ  application  to  the  Court  of"
"Appeal was mainly, if not entirely, in respect of the alleged acts (and omissions) of"
"officers of the Commissioner of Elections, and not in relation to decisions, directions,"
"acts, orders or rulings of the Commissioner of Elections, He did not allege any exercise"
"(by those officers or by the Commissioner of Elections) of the powers of the Election"
"Commission. Those acts could not have been regarded ex facie as an exercise of the"
"powers of the Commissioner of Elections and/or of the Election Commission…”9"
