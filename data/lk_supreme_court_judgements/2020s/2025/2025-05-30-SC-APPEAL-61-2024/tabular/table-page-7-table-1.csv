"“But even with regard to bribery, there are certain deﬁciencies in the exis(cid:415)ng law"
"which the government is endeavouring to correct. There are two limita(cid:415)ons in that"
"ﬁeld which we think require legisla(cid:415)ve ac(cid:415)on for the purpose of correc(cid:415)on  of the"
"exis(cid:415)ng anomalies."
"One of these deﬁciencies relates to the deﬁni(cid:415)on of public servant which is part and"
"parcel of the present law. The deﬁni(cid:415)on refers to oﬃcers, servants and employees of"
"the State. There is some element of doubt as to whether ministers, deputy ministers,"
"members of parliament, members of provincial councils and other persons fall within"
"the ambit of this deﬁni(cid:415)on. It is purely for the purpose of clarifying a doubt which"
"exists at present that the new sec(cid:415)on has been put in and in that area we think it is"
"totally proper that the change should apply with retroac(cid:415)ve eﬀect because it cannot"
"be contended with any degree of validity that dis(cid:415)nc(cid:415)on should be drawn between"
"a poli(cid:415)cian and a bureaucrat with regard to the applica(cid:415)on of that oﬀense. So that"
"par(cid:415)cular deﬁni(cid:415)on will be given eﬀect retroac(cid:415)vely.” [Page 413]"
