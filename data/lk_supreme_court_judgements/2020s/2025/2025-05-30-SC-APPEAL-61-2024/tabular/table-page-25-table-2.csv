"Court be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal."
"isira De Abrew, J held that:"
"“ If this argument is correct, whenever a party dissa(cid:415)sﬁed with an order of the trial"
"court whether it is a ﬁnal order or not ﬁles a pe(cid:415)(cid:415)on of appeal, the proceedings of"
"the trial court must be stayed. If this procedure is adopted by trial courts, can the"
"trial court conclude cases expedi(cid:415)ously? I say no. If the said procedure is adopted it"
"will  lead  to  an  absurd  situa(cid:415)on  and  the  public  faith  in  the  judicial  system  of  this"
"country will start eroding. Adop(cid:415)on of the said procedure will undoubtedly frustrate"
"the smooth func(cid:415)oning of the trial Court. Therefore if a party dissa(cid:415)sﬁed with an"
"order of the High Court ﬁles a pe(cid:415)(cid:415)on of appeal, the order appealed against, in my"
"view,  must  be  a  ﬁnal  order.  This  conten(cid:415)on  is  strengthened  by  the  provisions  of"
"sec(cid:415)on  331(2)  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  which  contemplates  of  a  ﬁnal"
"order.” [emphasis added]"
