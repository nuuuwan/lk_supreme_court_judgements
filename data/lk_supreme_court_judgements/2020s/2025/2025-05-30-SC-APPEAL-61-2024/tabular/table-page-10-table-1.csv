"Similarly, in the Holy Bible, Chapter 18, Verse 21 of the book of Exodus explicitly highlights"
"that when choosing leaders, they must be capable men who fear God and trustworthy"
"men who reject dishonest gain as trustworthiness and rejec(cid:415)on of corrup(cid:415)on are essen(cid:415)al"
"quali(cid:415)es of a good leader. The verse states that, “But in addi(cid:415)on, you should choose some"
"capable men and appoint them as leaders of the people: leaders of thousands, hundreds,"
"ﬁ(cid:332)ies, and tens. They must be God-fearing men who can be trusted and who cannot be"
"bribed.” [Exodus 18:21]"
