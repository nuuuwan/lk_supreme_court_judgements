Inves(cid:415)gate  Allega(cid:415)ons  of  Bribery  or  Corrup(cid:415)on 
[supra]  where"
"Samayawardhena, J held as follows:"
"“It was held in the landmark case of Mar(cid:415)n v. Wijewardena [1989] 2 Sri LR 409 that"
"Ar(cid:415)cle 138(1) only deﬁnes the jurisdic(cid:415)on of the Court of Appeal and does not create"
"or  confer  new  rights  of  appeal  to  persons. 
It 
is  now  well-se(cid:425)led 
law  across"
"jurisdic(cid:415)ons that the right of appeal is a  creature of statute, not  an inherent or"
"common law right. Such a right must be explicitly and expressly conferred by statute,"
"not implied or inferred. As observed in The People’s Bank v. Camillus Perera [2003] 2"
"Sri LR 358 at 360, if there is no right of appeal, unless expressly provided for, there"
"is no right to make an applica(cid:415)on for leave to appeal, as the gran(cid:415)ng of such leave"
"would  eﬀec(cid:415)vely  make  the  applica(cid:415)on  a  ﬁnal  appeal.  What  cannot  be  achieved"
"directly, cannot be achieved indirectly.” [emphasis added]"
