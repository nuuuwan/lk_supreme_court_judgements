When the case was taken up for trial before the High Court on 14th March 2022, the learned President\u2019s Counsel appearing for the 2nd Accused at that \u019fme had submi\u01a9ed that even though a Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers is a \u2018public servant\u2019 for the purposes of the Bribery Act, the 1st Accused was not a \u2018public o\ufb03cer\u2019 within the meaning of the phrase \u2018public o\ufb03cer\u2019 contained in Ar\u019fcle 170 of the Cons\u019ftu\u019fon.

It was therefore the posi\u019fon of the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the 2nd Accused that the 1st Accused cannot be indicted in terms of the Bribery Act. The consequen\u019fal argument was that since charges cannot be maintained against the 1st Accused, no charges can be maintained against the 2nd Accused, as well, and therefore",

I am in agreement with the conclusion reached by the High Court for the simple reason that the de\ufb01ni\u019fon of \u2018public o\ufb03cer\u2019 contained in the Cons\u019ftu\u019fon is for the purposes of the Cons\u019ftu\u019fon, as clearly speci\ufb01ed at the commencement of Ar\u019fcle 170.

With regard to the other preliminary objec\u019fon that an accused does not have a right of appeal against an interim order of the High Court, the Court of Appeal has not considered the provisions of the Judicature Act but has instead proceeded on the basis that the impugned order of the High Court was a \ufb01nal order, applied the reasoning of this Court in Dona Padma Priyanthi Senanayake v Chamika Jayantha and others [SC Appeal No. 41/2015; SC minutes of 4th August 2017] which had considered the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and which therefore had no relevance, and overruled the objec\u019fon that the accused had no right of appeal. Ques\u019fons of Law I shall now deal with the \ufb01nal part of this judgment. Leave to appeal has been granted by this Court on 30th May 2024 on the following ques\u019fons of law: 1.

During the course of the hearing before this Court, the learned Addi\u019fonal Solicitor General dis\u019flled the core ques\u019fon of law to be determined in this appeal as being whether an accused who stands indicted before the High Court has a right of appeal against an interim order made by the High Court. This ques\u019fon brings into play three important laws rela\u019fng to appeals. The \ufb01rst is the Cons\u019ftu\u019fon which sets out the forum jurisdic\u019fon of the Court of Appeal. The second is the Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978, as amended which confers the right of appeal. The third is the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, as amended which sets out the procedure that should be followed in pu\u01abng into mo\u019fon such right of appeal conferred by the Judicature Act in the forum provided for by the Cons\u019ftu\u019fon. There are two ma\u01a9ers that I wish to advert to, prior to considering the above ques\u019fon and the statutory provisions rela\u019fng thereto. Failure by the Appellant to name necessary par\u019fes I have already stated that proceedings have been ins\u019ftuted in the High Court by the Director General of CIABOC and that the Director General should have been named as a party to the applica\u019fons made by the Accused to the Court of Appeal. Although the Director General of CIABOC had not been made a party in the said applica\u019fons to the Court of Appeal, the appeal to this Court has been made by the Director General. Admi\u01a9edly, neither the CIABOC nor its members have been made a party to this appeal. During the hearing, the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the 1st Accused submi\u01a9ed that this appeal is misconceived in law since the CIABOC who was the party before the Court of Appeal should have invoked the jurisdic\u019fon of this Court since the rights of CIABOC cannot be decided in its absence. Not having made the Director General a party before the Court of Appeal, it is indeed ironic for the 1st Accused to now claim that CIABOC is a necessary party. While this is a ma\u01a9er that should have been raised at the \u019fme leave was granted, the necessity for me to consider this submission does not arise since it has been",

This includes the provisions of the Judicature Act, the Commission to Inves\u019fgate Allega\u019fons of Bribery or Corrup\u019fon Act, the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990.

It is now well-se\u01a9led law across jurisdic\u019fons that the right of appeal is a creature of statute, not an inherent or common law right. Such a right must be explicitly and expressly conferred by statute, not implied or inferred. As observed in The People\u2019s Bank v. Camillus Perera [2003] 2 Sri LR 358 at 360, if there is no right of appeal, unless expressly provided for, there is no right to make an applica\u019fon for leave to appeal, as the gran\u019fng of such leave would e\ufb00ec\u019fvely make the applica\u019fon a \ufb01nal appeal.

    "text": "learned Addi\u019fonal Solicitor General. In view of the above conclusion, the necessity for me to refer to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act does not arise. Abuse of process The ra\u019fonale for not gran\u019fng an accused a right of appeal against each and every order delivered by the High Court prior to convic\u019fon is to ensure that proceedings are concluded expedi\u019fously, e\ufb00ec\u019fvely and e\ufb03ciently. Furthermore, in terms of Sec\u019fon 333(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the case record must be submi\u01a9ed to the Court of Appeal no sooner an appeal is \ufb01led. Thus, if an appeal is available against each and every order, it would e\ufb00ec\u019fvely stay all proceedings before the High Court. Quite apart from the frivolous nature of the objec\u019fon raised before the High Court that the 1st Accused is not a public servant for the purposes of the Bribery Act, the raising of the said objec\u019fon and the subsequent applica\u019fon to the Court of Appeal have clearly resulted in the trial that was scheduled to start in March 2022 being delayed by over three years. To my mind, the ac\u019fons of the 1st and 2nd Accused are a clear abuse of process. A similar situa\u019fon as in this appeal arose in Ravi Karunanayake v A\u01a9orney General [CA (PHC) Applica\u019fon No. 66/2010; CA minutes of 26th May 2010] where an objec\u019fon was taken to the jurisdic\u019fon of the High Court to proceed with the indictment.

If this procedure is adopted by trial courts, can the trial court conclude cases expedi\u019fously? I say no. If the said procedure is adopted it will lead to an absurd situa\u019fon and the public faith in the judicial system of this country will start eroding. Adop\u019fon of the said procedure will undoubtedly frustrate the smooth func\u019foning of the trial Court. Therefore if a party dissa\u019fs\ufb01ed with an order of the High Court \ufb01les a pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal, the order appealed against, in my view, must be a \ufb01nal order.

Such an interpreta\u019fon could also lead to abuse of the process of the Court, because in terms of Sec\u019fon 333(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, once an appeal is accepted, all further proceedings in such case shall be stayed and the appeal together with the case record and eight copies thereof shall be forwarded to the Court of Appeal as quickly as possible.\u201d I may also add that raising frivolous objec\u019fons and therea\u014cer invoking the appellate jurisdic\u019fon of either this Court or the Court of Appeal with a view of delaying the wheels of jus\u019fce from turning is a phenomenon that has emerged within the criminal jus\u019fce system in the recent past, and very unfortunately, is fast becoming a regular prac\u019fce.",
