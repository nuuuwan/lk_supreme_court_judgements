"persons who have in good faith acted upon it as a genuine expression of"
"intention.”"
"Accordingly,   the   learned   Judges   of   the   High   Court   have   rightly   held   that   the"
"execution of promissory note ‘P1’ was sufficiently established and proceeded to set"
"aside the judgment of the learned District Judge holding the case in favour of the"
"Plaintiff."
"Issues to be Considered by this Court"
"The Defendant sought leave to appeal from this Court against the said judgment of"
"the Civil Appellate High Court."
"Consequently, three points arise for consideration by this Court."
"(a) Whether the appeal preferred against the judgment of the District Court was out"
"of time by seven days and hence the High Court had no jurisdiction to grant the"
"impugned judgment?"
"(b)   Was   there   evidence   of   presentment   of   the   promissory   note,   justifying   the"
"judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court?"
