"the following passage from  Justice Weeramantry’s treatise,  ‘The Law of Contracts’"
"[1999 reprint, vol. 1 at page 300] as follows:"
"“A person signing a document is held strictly to its terms on the basis that"
"he does so at his peril. This is known as the caveat subscriptor rule, and in"
"the operation of this rule the principles relating to justus error come into"
"play. This rule must not however be viewed as a special head of exemption"
"from the ordinary rules relating to mistake. Where a person deliberately"
"affixes his signature to a written contract, the court would naturally be"
"more hesitant in permitting him to plead that he did so in consequence of a"
"mistake as to the nature or substance of the transaction, and to this extent"
"would be less prone to view the error as justus."
