"Section 85 provides thus;"
"“85.  (1) A promissory note is an unconditional promise in writing made by one"
"person to another signed by the maker, engaging to pay, on demand or at a fixed or"
"determinable future time, a sum certain in money, to, or to the order of, a specified"
"person or to bearer."
"(2) An instrument in the form of a note payable to maker's order is not a note within"
"the meaning of this section, unless and until it is indorsed by the maker."
"(3) A note is not invalid by reason only that it contains also a pledge of collateral"
"security with authority to sell or dispose thereof."
"(4) A note which is, or on the face of it purports to be, both made and payable within"
"Ceylon is an inland note. Any other note is a foreign note.”"
