"The Supreme Court in Donald Jason Ranaveera and another v. Bank of Ceylon24 it"
"was held that an objection with regard to failure of presentment and dishonor should"
"be raised at the commencement of the case. Justice Pathirana has observed,"
"“I   propose   to   uphold   his   preliminary   objection   that   Mr.   de   Silva   should   not   be"
"permitted to raise for the first time in appeal that the promissory note sued upon was"
"one for which presentment for payment or notice of dishonour was necessary and"
"that   the   plaintiff   should   have   pleaded   these   matters   or   that   these   matters   were"
"excused or dispensed with on the facts of this case. If this point was allowed to be"
"argued I have no doubt it would put the plaintiff in irreparable disadvantage and"
"cause considerable damage and prejudice to his case, The plaintiff had due to this"
"deliberate omission of the defendants, been deprived of the opportunity to meet this"
"defence, if necessary, by an amendment of the pleadings and by leading evidence at"
"the trial.”"
"Upon careful examination of the criteria set out in the said cases, I am of the view"
"that the new points sought to be raised for the first time on appeal are not pure"
"questions  of  law. They  are   mixed  with  facts   and  should  have  been  raised  in  the"
"District Court, affording the Plaintiff an opportunity to lead the necessary evidence."
"As   was   held   in  Sirimevan   Maha   Mudalige   Kalyani   Sririmevan   v.   Herath"
"Mudiyanselage   Gunarat   Manike,25  if   the   Defendant   is   allowed   to   raise   the   new"
"points for the first time in appeal, it will deprive the Plaintiff of the opportunity to"
"lead evidence to meet with the same. Hence, I am of the view that the Defendant"
"should not be allowed to raise the said issues for the first time in appeal."
"However, for the purpose of clarity, and as the said points were put in issue, I will"
"now deal with them."
