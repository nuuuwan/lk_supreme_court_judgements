"In fact, the Defendant in his evidence has admitted the Plaintiff having a quarrel with"
"him on this dispute. Added to this, the Plaintiff has sent the letter of demand marked"
"‘P 2’ receipt of which was admitted by the Defendant.28"
"The Defendant has not replied and disputed the claim therein. It is settled law that in"
"commercial transactions a letter of demand should be replied and failure to do so"
"proceeds to support the proposition that the opposing party acknowledged the claim."
"The following dictum of Lord Esher M.R. in Wiedeman v. Walpole29 was quoted with"
"approval in Colombo Electric Tramways and Lighting Co. Ltd v. Pereira.30"
"“Now there are cases—business and mercantile cases—in which the Courts have"
"taken notice that, in the ordinary course of business, if one man of business states in"
"a letter to another that he has agreed to do certain things, the person who receives"
"that letter must answer it, if he means to dispute the fact that he did so agree. So,"
"where merchants are in dispute one with the other in the course of carrying on some"
"business negotiations, and one writes to the other, “but you promised me that you"
"would do this or that”, if the other does not answer that letter, but proceeds with the"
"negotiations, he must be taken to admit the truth of the statement.”"
"The Court of Appeal has reiterated the rule of law that the silence on the part of a"
"receiver of a letter of demand leads to the inference that the charge was impliedly"
