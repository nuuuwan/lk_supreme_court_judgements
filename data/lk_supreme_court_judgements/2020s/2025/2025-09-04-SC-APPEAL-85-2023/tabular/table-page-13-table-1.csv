"invoking the jurisdiction of the Civil Appellate High Court is not patent but latent"
"lack of jurisdiction."
"It is settled law that in case of latent lack of jurisdiction objection should be raised at"
"the earliest possible opportunity. In Jalaldeen v. Rajaratnam15 it was held that."
"“An objection to jurisdiction must be taken at the earliest opportunity. Further, issues"
"relating to the fundamental jurisdiction of the Court cannot be raised in an oblique"
"or veiled manner but must be expressly set out. The action was within the general"
"and local jurisdiction of the District Court. Hence its decision will stand until the"
"wronged party has matters set right by taking the course prescribed by law.”16"
"In  David Appuhamy v.   Yassassi Thero  17  the Court of Appeal has held that if no"
"objection was taken at the outset with regard to the jurisdiction, the Court is vested"
"with the power to proceed and make a valid order. Therefore, failure to follow a"
"procedural   step   in   invoking   the   jurisdiction   of   Court   result   in   lack   of   latent"
"jurisdiction   which   if   not   is   raised   at   the   outset,   cannot   be   raised   thereafter."
"Accordingly, in Par marketers (Pvt) Ltd v. Hatton National Bank Ltd18  it was held"
"that no objection could be raised with regard to the validity of an affidavit in an"
"application seeking leave to appeal where leave was granted. The very issue as in this"
"case arose for consideration in the case of Nawinna Kottage Dona Lalitha Padmini"
"and Another v. N.K.D. Pradeepa Nishanthi Kumari and others (Supra) it was held"
"that an objection on lapse of time in preferring a petition of appeal to the High Court"
"cannot be raised for the first time in the Supreme Court without offering proper"
"explanation for failure to raise such an objection. Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, P.C."
"has observed that;"
