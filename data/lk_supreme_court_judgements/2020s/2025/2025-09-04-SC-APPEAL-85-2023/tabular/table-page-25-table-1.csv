"Likewise,   where   the   plaintiff   relies   upon   a   matter   of   excuse   for   non-"
"presentment he must state such matter of excuse in the statement of claim"
"(Bullen & Leake, Precedents & Pleadings, 11th ed., p. 132). With particular"
"reference to the special procedure of proceedings by specially indorsed writ,"
"corresponding broadly with summary procedure upon liquid claims under our"
"law, Byles observes (Byles on Bills, 21st ed., p. 344) that where proceedings in"
"the High Court are instituted by specially 'indorsed writ under Order 3, Rule"
"6, the special indorsement must aver performance of the conditions necessary"
"to entitle the plaintiff to payment, such as presentment, protest and notice of"
"dishonour or the excuses for non-performance, in default of which the plaintiff"
"would not be entitled to summary judgment. Reference may also be made to"
"the Appendices to the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, Part V, Appendix C of"
"which contains specimen statements of claim which may be likened to those"
"appearing in our Civil Procedure Code. A number of these specimens show"
"that averments of presentment and notice of dishonour, or of excuses therefor,"
"must be made.‚Äù"
