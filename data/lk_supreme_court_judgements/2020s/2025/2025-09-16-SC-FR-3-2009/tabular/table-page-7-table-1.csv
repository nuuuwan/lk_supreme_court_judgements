"The  crux  of  the  complaint  of  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  1st  Respondent  terminated  his"
"contract unlawfully and thereby infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"Article 12(1)  of the Constitution guarantees  equal protection of the law and not equal"
"violation  [Mackie  &  Co.  v.  Molagoda  (1986)  1  Sri  LR  300,  309-313;  Gamaethige  v."

"In order to be entitled to a declaration that the alleged termination of his services infringes"
"Article 12(1), the Petitioner must first establish that his appointment on a contract basis"
"to the 1st Respondent is lawful. Where the appointment is not in accordance with law, this"
"Court cannot grant any relief for the termination of such employment as it will amount to"
"perpetuating an unlawful appointment."
"Moreover,  this  Court  is  exercising  just  and  equitable  jurisdiction.  Equity  cannot  give"
"validity to unlawful decisions."
"In  this  context,  I  observe  that  all  the  documents  on  which  the  Petitioner  relies  on  to"
"establish his appointment has been given by the Chairman or the General Manager of the"
"1st Respondent."
"The 1st Respondent was established by Section 2(1) of the Western Province Provincial"
"Road Development Authority Statute No. 04 of 1989 (Statute). In terms of Section 11(1)"
"of the Statute, the power to appoint staff to the 1st Respondent is vested in the Provincial"
"Public Service Commission. The Chairman or the General Manager of the 1st Respondent"
"does not have any power to make appointments. As such, the contractual appointment"
"given to the Petitioner is devoid of any legal effect and null and void."
