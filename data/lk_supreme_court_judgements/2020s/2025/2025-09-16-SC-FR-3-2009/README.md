Respondents

Argued On : 17.03.2025 Decided On : 16.09.2025

Janak De Silva, J.

The Petitioner was a member of the Panadura Pradeshiya Sabha. He was appointed as a

Road Development Officer (Colombo District) of the 1st Respondent, the Western Province

Provincial Road Development Authority. The appointment was on a contract basis with

effect from 22.02.2001 for a period of six (6) months. This appointment was continuously

extended for a six (6) month period at a time. The last extension was up to 31.07.2008.

He was paid his salary up to this date.

According to the Petitioner, it has been the practice, at the end of a particular period of

contract, to extend the Petitioners contract automatically and to subsequently issue a

formal letter intimating the renewal of the contract. After the expiration of the contracts,

the Petitioner reported to duty continuously and the formal letters intimating the

extension of the contract have been issued several months later and in some instances

even upon the expiration of the contractual period. The Petitioner was paid his salary with

arrears only after the necessary administrative arrangements have been made with regard

to the renewal of his contract which usually took several months.

As such the Petitioner continued to report to duty and carried out his normal functions

and duties after 31.07.2008. However, his salary was not paid from August, 2008. The

Petitioner anticipated that as has been the practice, the formal intimation of the extension

of his contract would be made at a later stage and that his salary would be paid with

arrears.

However, by letter dated 26.11.2008, the 8th Respondent informed the Petitioner that his

services had been terminated with effect from 31.07.2008. Petitioners claims that he

received this letter only on 04.12.2008. The Petitioner complains of infringement of his

fundamental rights.

Leave to proceed has been granted under Article 12(1).

It is the contention of the Petitioner that the then Chairman of the 1st Respondent sought

to absorb the Petitioner into the permanent cadre and his recommendation was approved

by the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent. However, no further action had been

taken.

The Petitioner contends that the termination was due to the leadership he gave to a forest

cultivation project carried out under the Jathika Saviya Gama Neguma Development Plan

for 2007 on a portion of state land called Galgoda Kele. However, the Divisional

Secretary of Panadura, Municipal Council of Panadura and the Provincial Waste

Management Authority of the Western Province sought to utilise this land for a garbage

disposal project to be implemented by a private company. The Petitioner filed a

fundamental rights application No. SC (FR) 538/2008 impugning this action. According to

the Petitioner the termination of his contract was as a result of this action.

The Respondents deny infringing any fundamental rights of the Petitioner. It was

contended that in terms of the contractual appointment, the salary of the Petitioner was

to be paid only upon the presentation and approval of various progress reports at various

stages during a month. The Petitioner failed to comply with the terms and conditions of

his appointment. It is further contended that the application is time barred. The

Respondents further contended that the Petitioner failed to report to the Head Office of

the 1st Respondent in Colombo. It was contended that the period of service of the

Petitioner came to an end on 31.07.2008.

The crux of the complaint of the Petitioner is that the 1st Respondent terminated his

contract unlawfully and thereby infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution guarantees equal protection of the law and not equal

violation [Mackie & Co. v. Molagoda (1986) 1 Sri LR 300, 309-313; Gamaethige v.

Siriwardena (1988) 1 Sri LR 384 at 404; Jayasekera v. Wipulasena and Others (1988) 2

Sri LR 237; Jayasuriya v. Vandergert, Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Others

(S.C.F.R., 620/97 S.C.M. 30.10.1998); Dissanayake v. Priyal De Silva (2007) 2 Sri LR 134;

Ceylon Electricity Board v. Hon. Athauda Seneviratne and Others (S.C. Appeal No.

167/2014; S.C.M. 23.05.2025)].

In order to be entitled to a declaration that the alleged termination of his services infringes

Article 12(1), the Petitioner must first establish that his appointment on a contract basis

to the 1st Respondent is lawful. Where the appointment is not in accordance with law, this

Court cannot grant any relief for the termination of such employment as it will amount to

perpetuating an unlawful appointment.

Moreover, this Court is exercising just and equitable jurisdiction. Equity cannot give

validity to unlawful decisions.

In this context, I observe that all the documents on which the Petitioner relies on to

establish his appointment has been given by the Chairman or the General Manager of the

1st Respondent.

The 1st Respondent was established by Section 2(1) of the Western Province Provincial

Road Development Authority Statute No. 04 of 1989 (Statute). In terms of Section 11(1)

of the Statute, the power to appoint staff to the 1st Respondent is vested in the Provincial

Public Service Commission. The Chairman or the General Manager of the 1st Respondent

does not have any power to make appointments. As such, the contractual appointment

given to the Petitioner is devoid of any legal effect and null and void.

Accordingly, the Petitioner cannot claim any infringement of his fundamental rights

guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution based on an unlawful appointment.

Application dismissed. I make no order as to costs.
