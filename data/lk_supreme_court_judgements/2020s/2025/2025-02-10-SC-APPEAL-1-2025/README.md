Samayawardhena, J.

This appeal arises from the order of the District Court of Panadura dated

29.11.2021, wherein the Court upheld the objection raised by the

defendants counsel to the marking of a document through the plaintiff

and, further, rejected the entire list of witnesses and documents filed by

the plaintiff including the said document, on the ground that the list had

been filed out of time. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal of

Kalutara, by its judgment dated 28.04.2023, affirmed this finding.

I must make it clear that this judgment primarily focuses on the legal

position as it stood prior to the significant changes made by the Civil

Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 29 of 2023 on this subject under

consideration. However, this analysis is not a futile exercise as there are

a large number of cases pending in District Courts and Appellate Courts

that remain governed by the previous provisions in view of the

transitional provisions embodied in section 21 of Act No. 29 of 2023. In

addition, the principles enunciated herein may also serve as a guide for

interpreting the current provisions where appropriate.

3

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

Pre-trial proceedings were introduced to the District Court for the first

time by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 8 of 2017.

Although it is widely regarded that filing the list of witnesses and

documents constitutes a pre-trial step, this Act did not consider it to be

so. Sections 121 and 175 of the Civil Procedure Code, which governed

the filing of the list of witnesses and documents, were not amended by

this Act to facilitate an effective pre-trial hearing. Therefore, it was

permissible to file lists of witnesses and documents even after the pre-

trial hearing. As the filing of the list of witnesses and documents was not

considered a pre-trial step, section 80A, introduced by this Act, which

debars pre-trial steps after the date fixed for the trial (unless grave and

irremediable injustice would result from not permitting such steps and

subject to costs), does not apply to the filing of lists of witnesses and

documents. While this may have been an oversight on the part of the

draftsman, at the time relevant to this appeal, sections 121 and 175

remained in force. Hence, the Court is bound to take cognizance of these

provisions and cannot disregard them or introduce new words to give a

different interpretation to those provisions.

Section 121(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, No. 2 of 1889, addressed only

the filing of the list of witnesses. It provided that a list of witnesses shall

be filed within such time before the trial as the Judge shall consider

reasonable, or at any time before the trial with the consent of the other

side. The filing of the list of documents, however, was primarily governed

by sections 50-54. Section 50 required that if the plaintiff sues upon a

document in his possession, it must be produced along with the plaint.

Section 51 stipulated that if the plaintiff relies on any other documents,

he must file a list of such documents with the plaint. Section 54 further

stated that documents not listed as specified above could only be marked

at the trial with the leave of the Court. At that time, there was no

4

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

provision which required a defendant to file a list of documents in the

District Court. (Subramanium v. Thilliampalam (1956) 54 CLW 12)

Section 121(2) was repealed and replaced with a new subsection under

the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 1977. This amended

provision was in force at the time material to this appeal.

121(2). Every party to an action shall, not less than fifteen days

before the date fixed for the trial of an action, file or cause to be filed

in court after notice to the opposite party

(a) a list of witnesses to be called by such party at the trial, and

(b) a list of the documents relied upon by such party and to be

produced at the trial.

I must pause to observe that, although Act No. 20 of 1977 introduced

timelines for filing lists of documents and amended section 175, the

original sections 50 to 54 of the Civil Procedure Code remain intact,

except for the repeal of section 54(2). In my view, this renders these

provisions largely redundant. It is also evident that these provisions are

not being adhered to by legal practitioners.

In this case, after the pre-trial hearing, the case was first fixed for trial

on 09.06.2021. The defendant filed her first list of witnesses and

documents as well as an additional list of witnesses and documents on

18.12.2020 and 11.01.2021 respectively, which is more than four

months before the first date of trial. In contrast, the plaintiff did not file

any list of witnesses or documents before the case was first fixed for trial.

On 09.06.2021 the case was not called in open Court due to the COVID-

19 pandemic and was subsequently refixed for trial on 28.10.2021. This

is the second date of trial. The plaintiff filed his list of witnesses and

documents for the first time on 14.10.2021, only 14 days before the

second date of trial whereas section 121(2) enacted that every party to

5

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

the action shall file the list of witnesses and documents not less than

fifteen days before the date fixed for the trial of an action.

The phrase fifteen days before the date fixed for the trial has been

correctly interpreted in a number of cases to mean fifteen days before the

date first fixed for the trial and not fifteen days before the date the case

is actually taken up for the trial.

This interpretation is consistent with the other provisions of the law.

According to section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code as it stood prior to

the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 8 of 2017, on the date

fixed for the filing of the answer of the defendant or where replication is

permitted, on the date fixed for the filing of such replication, and whether

the same is filed or not, the court shall appoint a date for the trial of the

action. After section 80 was replaced with a new section by Act No. 8 of

2017, section 80 stated that on the date the case is called to fix the date

of trial, the court shall appoint a date for the trial of the action. Section

80 was repealed and replaced by a new section under Act No. 29 of 2023.

Section 82 addresses postponements of the trial. According to section 80

read with section 82, the Court can fix a date for the trial of the action

only once. Thereafter, the trial can be postponed if it cannot be taken up

or concluded on the scheduled date.

In Rogers Agencies (Pvt) Ltd v. Peoples Merchant Bank Ltd [2005] 3 Sri LR

210 at 213, in reference to section 121 of the Civil Procedure Code,

Justice Somawansa stated that the meaning assigned to the words

before the day fixed for the hearing is the first date on which the trial is

fixed for hearing. The meaning of the aforesaid words is clear and no other

meaning could be assigned to the aforesaid words. Accordingly, it was

held that the additional list filed subsequent to the date the case was first

fixed for trial was clearly not in compliance with the requirements of

section 121(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

6

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

In Salih v. Hemawathie [2004] 3 Sri LR 91 at 93, in reference to section

121(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, Justice Amaratunga stated that this

section requires the parties to file their list of witnesses and documents

before the first date fixed for trial and if we are to interpret the words date

fixed for trial to mean the date on which the trial is first taken up, we have

to read into the section words which are not there and this is something

we are not prepared to do.

The same view was taken by Justice Amaratunga in Martin v. Indrani

Samarasinghe (CALA/536/2002, CA Minutes of 14.11.2003).

In Rajah Sinnathuray v. Malathi Perera (CALA/445/2005, CA Minutes of

12.02.2010), while drawing attention to sections 80, 82 and 121 of the

Civil Procedure Code, Justice Basnayake held:

These provisions make it clear that the court would fix a date of trial

only once and thereafter postpone the hearing. On appointing a date

of trial, the court shall notify such date to all parties. Whenever the

case is postponed for another date, there is no such requirement. The

requirement to file the list 15 days before the date fixed for the trial

as per section 121(2) means 15 days before the first date fixed for

the trial (Salih v. Hemawathie [2004] 2 Sri LR 96). Thus the

submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that a trial date is

any date the trial commences is untenable.

If the phrase the date fixed for the trial of an action is interpreted as the

date on which the trial is actually taken up in open Court, for instance,

any party who later realizes his failure to file the list of witnesses and

documents in compliance with section 121(2) could circumvent this

requirement by seeking a postponement on the first date of trial on a

pretext unrelated to the real reason and then file the list to fall within the

provision.

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

Learned counsel for the plaintiff states that as the case was not called in

open Court on 09.06.2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the date fixed

for the trial should be considered as 28.10.2021. However, as the District

Judge pointed out in his order, while open Court proceedings were

disrupted by the pandemic, the office remained operational. The

defendant filed her list of witnesses and documents well within the

stipulated time. Even for the sake of argument, 28.10.2021 is considered

the first date of trial, the list was still filed out of time as the plaintiff filed

the list not less than fifteen days before the trial but fourteen days before

the trial.

Be that as it may, at the trial, the plaintiff marked deed No. 10421 dated

03.11.1986 as P1 in his evidence. Counsel for the defendant objected to

it on the ground that the deed had been listed out of time. The District

Judge upheld the objection and rejected the entire list of witnesses and

documents, allowing only the plaintiff to give evidence. The procedure

adopted by the District Judge was contrary to established practice and

the law.

If the Court upholds the objection to the marking of a document on the

ground that it was not properly listed, there is no need to reject the entire

list on that basis. Objections to each witness and each document must

be considered separately. There is no prohibition against a party filing a

list or an additional list out of time, but such a list will not be considered

as one filed in compliance with section 121(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

For example, in Silva v. Silva [2006] 2 Sri LR 80, the defendant filed his

list of witnesses with a copy to the plaintiff out of time but ten days before

the case was first fixed for trial. After the close of the plaintiffs case, when

the defendant sought to call a witness from that list, the plaintiff objected

to it on the ground that the list had been filed out of time. The District

Judge upheld the objection. However, on appeal, Justice Wimalachandra

8

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

set aside the order stating that the plaintiff had been given sufficient

notice of the defendants original list of witnesses, which had been

available to the plaintiff for over five years prior to the defendant calling

the particular witness. Similarly, as observed by Justice Somawansa in

Rogers Agencies (Pvt) Ltd v. Peoples Merchant Bank Ltd (supra) at 216,

the Court cannot permit the entire list, if an objection is overruled with

respect to a single document included in that list.

It may be relevant to note that although section 121(2) enacts that every

party to an action shall file a list of witnesses and documents fifteen

days before the date fixed for the trial, it is not mandatory for each party

to an action to file such a list. A party may successfully conduct a trial

even without filing a list at all. As Bindra in Interpretation of Statutes (13th

Edition 2023) at page 449 states The word shall is not always decisive.

Regard must be had to the context, subject matter and object of the

statutory provision in question in determining whether the same is

mandatory or directory. In Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [1982] 2 Sri LR

693 at 702, Justice Sharvananda (as His Lordship then was) stated:

Prima facie the word shall suggests that it is mandatory, but that word

has often been rightly construed as directory. Everything turns on the

context in which it is used; and the purpose and effect of the section in

which it appears.

I must also add that, even if the rejection of the entire list is permissible,

such rejection does not preclude the party from calling witnesses or

marking documents included in the rejected list under section 175 of the

Civil Procedure Code. Even in cases where witnesses and documents

have not been listed at all, as opposed to filing the list belatedly, the Court

retains the discretion to permit witnesses to be called and documents to

be marked under section 175 of the Code. Section 175 was amended by

9

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Law, No. 20 of 1977. As of the

time relevant to this appeal, section 175 read as follows:

175(1) No witness shall be called on behalf of any party unless such

witness shall have been included in the list of witnesses previously

filed in court by such party as provided by section 121:

Provided, however, that the court may in its discretion, if special

circumstances appear to it to render such a course advisable in the

interests of justice, permit a witness to be examined, although such

witness may not have been included in such list aforesaid;

Provided also that any party to an action may be called as a witness

without his name having been included in any such list.

(2) A document which is required to be included in the list of

documents filed in court by a party as provided by section 121 and

which is not so included shall not, without the leave of the court, be

received in evidence at the trial of the action:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall apply to documents

produced for cross-examination of the witnesses of the opposite

party or handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory.

According to the second proviso to section 175(1), a party to the action

can be called as a witness whether or not his name is included in the list.

The Court could also allow an unlisted witness to be called if special

circumstances appear to it to render such a course advisable in the

interests of justice. It may be noted that section 175(2) adopts a more

flexible approach regarding unlisted documents, allowing such

documents to be marked with the leave of the court, without the need

to establish special circumstances as required for unlisted witnesses.

However, in both instances, the Court must exercise its discretion

10

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

judicially, not arbitrarily, in accordance with sound principles of law and

judicial precedent.

According to the proviso to section 175(2), unlisted documents can be

marked during the cross-examination of witnesses. However, this should

not be considered as a licence to mark any document through cross-

examination. Documents can only be marked during the cross-

examination to contradict the testimony of the witness. A document can

be marked if the witness is the author, recipient or has knowledge of the

document. If the witness is able to identify his handwriting or signature,

or any handwriting or signature of another person on the document, or

otherwise acknowledges the document, it can be marked.

If the witness acknowledges receipt of the document but disputes its

contents, it can be marked subject to proof of its contents. There may

be instances where a witness has previously seen the document or has

knowledge of it but does not accept its genuineness or authenticity. In

such cases, the document may be marked subject to proof allowing the

witness to explain his position regarding the document. As a general rule,

where the witness denies the document, it cannot be marked through

that witness. (Gabo Singho v. Karunawathie [2012] BLR 72) However, this

is not an absolute rule. If it is evident that the denial is intended to

conceal the truth and not bona fide, the Judge may allow the document

to be marked subject to proof. The decision of the Judge in such

circumstances is more a matter of prudence than of science. According

to the last part of the Explanation to section 154(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code, Whether the document is admitted or not it should be marked as

soon as any witness makes a statement with regard to it; and if not earlier

marked on this account, it must, at least, be marked when the court

decides upon admitting it. However, section 114(1) of the Civil Procedure

Code states No document shall be placed on the record unless it has been

11

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

proved or admitted in accordance with the law of evidence for the time

being in force. It is important to understand that allowing a document to

be marked does not amount to admitting it in evidence. Marking a

document and admitting it in evidence are two distinct processes. The

Judge has the power to reject any document marked during the trial,

whether or not marked subject to proof, in the final evaluation of the

evidence in the judgment. Similarly, documents marked subject to proof

but not technically proved should not be automatically rejected. For

instance, when a document is marked by the author himself, and the

opposite party moves to have it marked subject to proof, the document

need not be rejected on the basis that it was not proved by calling

witnesses. The determination of whether a document has been proved,

its admissibility in evidence, and the extent of its admissibility should be

made at the conclusion of the trial, based on the unique facts and

circumstances of each case.

The first part of the Explanation to section 154(3) of the Civil Procedure

Code states that if the opposing party does not object to the marking of a

document, the Court may allow it to be marked and admitted in evidence,

provided it is not a document prohibited by law from being received in

evidence. In Seyed Mohomed v. Perera (1956) 58 NLR 246 at 254, Justice

Sinnetamby explained that What is meant, by the expression forbidden

by law as considered in the case of Siyadoris v. Danoris (1941) 42 NLR

311 and construed to mean absolute prohibition and not to include a case

where evidence was required not to be received or used unless certain

requirements were fulfilledan instance of absolute prohibition which

immediately comes to mind is income tax returns made by a person to the

Income Tax Department. If the opposing party objects to the marking of

the document, such objection must be raised at the time the document

is marked and not at a later stage of the trial or on appeal. This rule also

applies to notarially executed documents including deeds. (Silva v.

12

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

Kindersly (1914) 18 NLR 85, Siyadoris v. Danoris (1841) 42 NLR 311,

Seyed Mohomed v. Perera (1956) 58 NLR 246, Cinemas Ltd v.

Sounderarajan [1998] 2 Sri LR 16) If an objection is raised to the marking

of a document at the appropriate time, the Court must first decide on the

authenticity of the document, and then decide whether it constitutes

legally admissible evidence.

A document marked subject to proof, but not subsequently proved, may

still constitute valid evidence if the party objecting fails to raise that

matter when closing the case reading in evidence the marked documents,

as such failure is deemed a waiver of the objection previously raised. This

has been the cursus curiae of the original civil Courts (Sri Lanka Ports

Authority v. Jugolinija Boat East [1981] 1 Sri LR 18, Balapitiya

Gunananda Thero v. Talalle Methananda Thero [1997] 2 Sri LR 101), and

was subsequently given statutory recognition through the introduction of

section 154A to the Civil Procedure Code by Act No. 17 of 2022.

According to section 155 of the Civil Procedure Code, before a witness is

allowed to identify a document, he should generally be asked to state the

grounds of his knowledge of the document. Section 156 provides that,

the opposing party, if he desires to do so, should be allowed to interpose

with cross-examination on this point before the document is shown to the

witness. Judges must not allow section 156 to be misused to delay or

hinder the steady progress of the trial, as the same questions can be

asked during cross-examination.

A document which is thirty years old can be marked under section 90 of

the Evidence Ordinance if it is produced from proper custody. This

section provides that any document, thirty years old produced from any

custody which the Court in the particular case considers proper, may be

presumed to be genuine both regarding to its contents and its due

execution. The explanation to that section states that Documents are

13

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

said to be in proper custody if they are in the place in which, and under

the care of the person with whom they would naturally be; but no custody

is improper if it is proved to have had a legitimate origin, or in the

circumstances of the particular case are such as to render such an origin

possible. Section 161 of the Civil Procedure Code is to a similar effect

but does not specify a time period, as section 90 of the Evidence

Ordinance does. Section 161 reads as follows: When the document

purports on the face of it to be so old that proof of the actual execution is

not required by law, it is not proved until sufficient evidence has been given

to prove both that it comes into court from the proper custody, and that it

has continued to be in proper custody throughout the period during which

it can be reasonably accounted for. It must be stressed that the word

document in these sections refers to the original document itself.

However, in reference to section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance, Justice

K.D. De Silva with the agreement of Chief Justice Basnayake in

Davoodbhoy v. Farook (1956) 58 NLR 126, held that the duplicate of a last

will over thirty years old produced in that case was admissible under

section 90 of the Evidence Ordinance as it was produced from proper

custody. His Lordship at page 132 stated The reason why section 90

insists on proper custody is to ensure the authenticity of the documents

admitted under that section. Whether or not a particular custody is proper

is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of each case.

Proper custody does not necessarily mean the best or the strictly legal

custody. It is sufficient if the circumstances render it probable that the

origin was legitimate. The decision of the Court on the question of proper

custody will depend on the unique facts and circumstances of each case.

It is significant to note that when a thirty-year-old document is marked

from proper custody, the Court may, not shall, accept the contents of the

document. In Dingiri Appu v. Mohottihamy (1963) 68 NLR 40 at 43, Chief

Justice Basnayake stated that Kiri Menika v. Duraya (supra) should not

14

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

be regarded as holding that the court is bound in every case to presume

any or all of the matters referred to in section 90 on the production of the

duplicate. It is open to the court, as in the case of the original itself, to

refrain from presuming any of the matters stated therein.

Sections 145(1) and 155(c) of the Evidence Ordinance are also relevant

in this regard. According to section 145(1), A witness may be cross-

examined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced

into writing and relevant to matters in question without such writing being

shown to him, or being proved; but if it is intended to contradict him by the

writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to

those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.

In terms of section 155(c), the credibility of a witness may be impeached

by the adverse party or, with the consent of the Court, by the party who

calls him by proof of former statements inconsistent with any part of his

evidence which is liable to be contradicted.

However, previous statements cannot just be marked to contradict a

witness without following the procedure laid down in section 145(1) of

the Evidence Ordinance. In Tennekoon v. Tennekoon 78 NLR 13 at 16,

Justice Malcolm Perera explained the procedure as follows:

Section 145 requires that if it is intended to put such writing to

contradict a witness, his attention must be called to those parts of

the statement which are to be used for contradicting him. The

witness must be afforded every opportunity to address his mind to

the relevant portion of the statement and every occasion given to him

to explain or reconcile his statements. If such an opportunity is not

given to the witness, the contradictory writing cannot properly be

admitted in evidence. The witness must be treated with fairness and

should be afforded every opportunity of explaining the contradictions

after his attention has been drawn with clarity and in a reasonable

15

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

manner. It is a question of fact in each case whether there has been

a substantial compliance with the requirements of section 145.

On the question of filing the list of witnesses and documents, let me

emphasize a very important point. As repeatedly highlighted by the

superior Courts, the underlying principle behind the requirement of filing

the list of witnesses and documents fifteen days before the trial is to

ensure that each party is fully aware of the witnesses and documents the

opposing party intends to rely upon in establishing his case at the trial,

thereby preventing any party from being taken by surprise and

eliminating the prejudice caused thereby.

A party cannot present a case at the trial that differs from what has been

pleaded and put in issue. Although our legal system operates within an

adversarial framework, litigation is not intended to be a mere contest of

strategy. It is not a game of hide and seek. It is a solemn process aimed

at uncovering the truth and ensuring justice by remedying injustice.

Technicalities that obstruct the pursuit of justice must be removed, and

cases should, as far as possible, be resolved on their merits, unless such

a course of action causes grave prejudice to the opposing party. Chief

Justice Bonser more than one and a quarter centuries ago, in the year

1895, in Read v. Samsudin 1 NLR 292 at 294, cited with approval the

following dicta of Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, from the case of

Jones v. Chennell, 8 Ch. D 506: It is not the duty of a Judge to throw

technical difficulties in the way of the administration of justice, but where

he sees that he is prevented from receiving material or available evidence

merely by reason of a technical objection, he ought to remove the technical

objection out of the way, upon proper terms as to costs and otherwise. His

Lordship concluded, Those observations of the late Master of the Rolls

ought to be borne in mind by every Judge in this Colony.

16

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

In describing the scope of section 175(1), Justice Gratiaen in the oft-

quoted case of Girantha v. Maria (1948) 50 NLR 519 at 522 stated as

follows:

It remains to be considered whether the learned Judge was justified

in refusing to allow Inspector Sivasambo to be called as a witness

for the defence. The proviso to section 175 of the Civil Procedure

Code authorises the Court to permit a witness to be called although

his name does not appear on the list of witnesses filed before the

commencement of the trial if such a course is advisable in the

interests of justice. The purpose of the requirement of section 175

that each party should know before the trial the names of the

witnesses whom the other side intends to call is to prevent surprise.

Subject to the element of surprise being avoided it is clearly in the

interests of justice that the Court, in adjudicating on the rights of

parties, should hear the testimony of every witness who can give

material evidence on the matters in dispute. In this case Inspector

Sivasambo is admittedly a person whose evidence, if accepted by

the trial Judge, would be of the greatest importance in deciding the

issue of prescription. The nature of the testimony which the

defendants anticipate he would give was expressly put to the 1st

plaintiff when she gave evidence. The element of surprise does not

arise because the plaintiffs had several months notice of the

defendants decision to call him on the adjourned date of hearing. In

these circumstances it seems to me that the objection raised by the

plaintiffs to Inspector Sivasambo being called as a witness was

highly technical and without merit. It was in the interests of justice

that this material witness should have been examined. The learned

Judge refused the application because the plaintiffs would be

placed at a disadvantage if Inspector Sivasambos evidence were

allowed to be called. This is no doubt correct in a sense, but the

17

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

paramount consideration is the ascertainment of the truth and not

the readily understandable desire of a litigant to be placed at a

tactical advantage by reason of some technicality. In my opinion

the learned Judge has not properly exercised the discretion vested

in him by section 175, and this Court is entitled to reverse his

decision.

When exercising discretion under section 175, the Court should allow

documents pleaded in the plaint, answer, replication, statement of claim,

statement of objections, etc., which the opposing party had prior notice

of, to be marked, regardless of whether they are listed, as there is no

element of surprise in permitting them to be marked.

In the Supreme Court case of Walker & Sons Co. Ltd. v. Masood [2004] 3

Sri LR 195, the document in question was allowed to be marked despite

not being included in the list filed under section 121(2), as it had been

referred to in the plaint and had been listed 13 days prior to the trial. The

Court held that there was no element of surprise in such circumstances.

Justice Weerasekera emphasized that section 175 of the Civil Procedure

Code permits the Court to allow unlisted documents to be marked in

appropriate circumstances. The Court rejected the contention that listing

documents under section 121(2) is mandatory.

In Arpico Finance Co. Ltd v. Perera [2007] 1 Sri LR 208, the document in

question, though listed in an additional list filed after the commencement

of the trial, had been referred to in the replication, and an issue had also

been raised based on it. On appeal, the District Court was directed to

allow the document to be marked. The Court held that the principle

underlying the requirement to file a list of witnesses and documents is to

prevent an element of surprise and to avoid causing prejudice to the

opposing party.

In Bibile v. Baduge [2008] 1 Sri LR 374, after the conclusion of the

plaintiffs evidence, the Court disallowed the plaintiff from calling the

surveyor who had prepared a plan pursuant to a commission issued by

the Court, citing non-compliance with section 121(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code. On appeal, this order was set aside, with the appellate

Court holding that the surveyor should have been permitted to testify

under section 175 of the Civil Procedure Code. The Court observed that

the surveyor prepared the plan on a commission issued by Court, and

the surveyor and the plan had also been included in the defendants list,

eliminating any element of surprise.

In Farose Ahmed v. Mohomed [2006] 2 Sri LR 66, the Court permitted the

marking of a document despite it not being listed fifteen days before the

first date of trial. The rationale was that the document in question was a

public document, specifically a Gazette Notification, and thus its

inclusion did not cause prejudice or surprise to the opposing party.

The foregoing discussion should not be construed as diminishing the

significance or legal force of section 121 of the Civil Procedure Code.

As Chief Justice G.P.S. De Silva emphasized in Asilin Nona v. Wilbert Silva

[1997] 1 Sri LR 176 and Abdul Munaf v. Mohamed Yusuf [1999] 2 Sri LR

76, where a witness or document has not been listed in compliance with

the law, the burden lies on the party failing to list to demonstrate the

existence of special circumstances that warrant the Courts indulgence

in granting such an application under section 175 of the Civil Procedure

Code. This was further illustrated by Justice Wimalachandra in

Siriwardena v. Dissanayake [2004] 3 Sri LR 137.

In this regard, sheer negligence, as opposed to an innocent mistake, does

not constitute special circumstances.

19

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

Although interest of justice and ascertainment of truth are primary

considerations, as Justice Amarasekara stated in Matilda Herathge v.

Dayananda (SC/APPEAL/97/2011, SC Minutes of 19.10.2023), For the

interest of justice and ascertainment of truth, it is necessary for each party

to know the scope of and nature of evidence of each others case. If one

acts in a prejudicial manner affecting the opposite partys rights or

entitlements by not listing an important document, he or she cannot be

allowed to ask permission to produce the same for interest of justice. As

Justice Amarasekara further pointed out, another advantage of filing lists

of documents as required by law is that the opposite party can make use

of the provisions in the Civil Procedure Code under chapter XVI including

interrogatories and inspection and production of documents for the benefit

of his case.

Procedural law should not be given a secondary position. Both

substantive law and procedural law are equally important for the proper

administration of justice. This principle was emphasized by Justice

Amarasinghe in Fernando v. Sybil Fernando and Others [1997] 3 Sri LR

1. Without procedural law, the administration of justice would descend

into confusion and uncertainty. Justice Bandaranayake (as Her Ladyship

then was) eloquently expressed this in Sudath Rohana v. Mohomed Zeena

[2011] 2 Sri LR 134 at 145: When it is stated that the substantive law

and procedural law are complementary, it signifies the importance of

procedural law in a legal system. Whilst the substantive law lays down

the rights, duties, powers, and liberties, the procedural law refers to the

enforcement of such rights and duties. In other words, the procedural law

breathes life into substantive law, sets it in motion, and functions side by

side with substantive law. Similarly, in Bhagwan Swaroop v. Mool Chand

AIR 1983 SC 355, Justice Sen observed: Excuse of lapses in compliance

with the laws of procedure, as a matter of course, with the avowed object

20

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

of doing substantial justice to the parties may in many cases lead to

miscarriage of justice.

There can be no rigid or universally applicable rule governing the

circumstances under which a trial Judge should permit unlisted

witnesses to be called or unlisted documents to be marked. Each decision

must be made based on the unique facts and circumstances of the case,

carefully weighing the competing interests at stake. The Judge must

balance the potential irreparable loss that may be caused to the party

seeking such permission if it is refused, against the substantial prejudice

that may be caused to the opposing party if it is granted. Ultimately, the

decision should be guided by the interests of justice, prioritizing the

ascertainment of the truth over rigid adherence to procedural

technicalities.

The case of Mashreq Bank v. Arunaselam [2007] BLR 20 serves as an

instructive example of how trial Judges should exercise their discretion

under section 175 of the Civil Procedure Code. In this case, the plaintiff

bank had originally listed its credit officer as a witness, but before his

evidence could be recorded, he left the bank. During the trial, the bank

filed an additional list naming the new credit officer as a witness.

Although this was clearly contrary to section 121 of the Civil Procedure

Code, the trial Judge overruled the objection to calling the new officer,

exercising discretion under section 175. On appeal, this decision was

upheld on the basis that no prejudice was caused to the defendant by

calling the succeeding officer as both were intended to present official

documents. Justice Wimalachandra endorsed the view expressed by the

trial Judge in the impugned order that when official documents are

produced, it is the documents which are material and not the person who

produces them.

21

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

On the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the ruling against

marking deed No. 10421 through the testimony of the plaintiff cannot be

justified. This deed was clearly pleaded the plaintiff in paragraph 2 of the

plaint as the title deed of the plaintiffs predecessor in title. The District

Judge should have allowed the document to be marked under section

175(2) of the Civil Procedure Code as there is no element of surprise in

allowing that deed to be marked. It is well-established that when an

objection is raised against a single document in a list, there is no

justification to reject the entire list that contains the contested document.

The District Judge is obliged to assess each witness and document in the

list separately on the merits.

For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to briefly state the law as it

stands today regarding the list of witnesses and documents. With the

enactment of the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 29 of 2023,

section 79A now requires the Court to appoint a date for the pre-trial

conference not less than three months and not exceeding five months

from the date of filing the answer or, where applicable, from the date

given for filing the replication, regardless of whether the replication was

filed.

It is important to note that, with this amendment, section 121(2) has

been repealed. Instead, in accordance with section 79B, parties are now

required to tender lists of witnesses and documents, along with copies of

the said documents in their possession and control, to the registry of the

Court not less than thirty days before the date first fixed for the pre-trial

conference. Simultaneously, the party must serve copies of the list and

documents on all other parties and provide proof of service thereof.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Evidence

(Special Provisions) Act, No. 14 of 1995, the Electronic Transactions Act,

No. 19 of 2006, or any other written law, where any party proposes to

22

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

tender a document in electronic form, the provisions of section 79C shall

apply to the tendering of such documents. A party proposing to tender

documents in electronic form shall, not less than thirty days before the

date first fixed for the pre-trial conference, file in Court, with copies

served on the opposing party or parties, a list of such documents in

electronic form, along with an index and copies of the documents

sufficient to enable the opposing party or parties to understand the

nature of the evidence. The steps the parties must take thereafter are set

out in the section.

In terms of section 142A of the Civil Procedure Code, the main purpose

of a pre-trial conference is to facilitate a settlement between the parties.

The pre-trial conference is not another procedural step in a civil case

such as filing the answer or calling the case in open Court to fix a date

for trial. It is also a mistake to assume that the purpose of a pre-trial

conference is to lay a solid foundation for a full-blown trial. In terms of

section 142A(2), it is the peremptory duty of each District Judge

conducting the pre-trial conference to make every effort to persuade the

parties to reach a settlement of the dispute. A Judge conducting a pre-

trial conference must actively take part in the process, rather than being

a passive observer or umpire. Settlement is the norm and fixing the case

for trial is the exception. The Judge shall fix the case for trial, if, and only

if, all settlement efforts fail. In the event the case is fixed for trial, the

Judge must limit the trial to the real issue or issues between the parties,

as identified by the Judge himself. In accordance with section 142F, the

Judge shall determine the issue or issues by considering the pleadings,

proposed admissions and issues of the parties, interrogatories,

documents, agreements of the parties, and reports, if any, submitted to

the Court during the pre-trial conference. Although the Judge may, of

course, seek the assistance of lawyers, the Judge cannot delegate this

judicial function to them.

23

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

There is no need to call all the witnesses or mark all the documents listed

in the list of witnesses and documents at the trial. In terms of section

142A and 142B, the Judge shall at the pre-trial conference identify the

necessary witnesses to be called and necessary documents to be marked

at the trial and make appropriate orders accordingly before the trial

proper takes place. If the pre-trial conference is conducted effectively,

only a limited number of witnesses would be called, and only the relevant

documents would be marked at the trial to resolve the specific issues on

which the parties could not reach agreement. This approach will

eliminate objections to witnesses and documents during the trial and

avoid the leading of unnecessary evidence, thereby promoting efficient

trial management and the speedy disposal of cases.

Although section 79B requires the list of witnesses and documents to be

filed not less than thirty days before the date first fixed for the pre-trial

conference, section 142D provides a party with another opportunity to

seek permission to call any additional witnesses and produce any

additional documents not listed thirty days before the pre-trial

conference, but identified or discovered at the pre-trial conference. This

section can be invoked to call additional witnesses and mark additional

documents. A party who did not file the list as required by section 79B

cannot invoke this provision unless the other party consents to it at the

pre-trial conference. Section 142D reads as follows:

142D(1). The court shall, at the pre-trial conference, on application of

any party, grant permission to such party, to call any witness or

produce any document at the trial, if such witness or document is

identified at such conference to be relevant to the matters in dispute,

notwithstanding such witness or document not being included in the

list of witnesses or documents filed under paragraph (b) of section

79B:

24

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

Provided that, the pre-trial Judge may award costs against the party

seeking to tender documents or summon witnesses which had not

been included in the list filed under paragraph (b) of section 79B

unless such party can adduce sufficient reasons for the failure to

include such documents or witnesses in the said list.

(2) The court may, at its discretion, grant permission at the pre-trial

conference, to any party to produce any document at the trial and

call any witness in proof thereof, if such document is discovered

under Chapter XVI relevant to the matters in dispute.

(3) Where the court grants permission to call any additional witness

or document under subsection (1) or (2), the court shall, at the pre-

trial conference, record the fact that such party is entitled to call such

witness or produce such document at the trial and no further list of

witnesses or documents is required to be filed thereafter.

Notwithstanding the detailed provisions introduced by Act No. 29 of 2023

requiring the parties to provide details of witnesses to be called and

documents to be marked at various stages prior to the trial, the

legislature, with wisdom, chose not to repeal section 175 of the Civil

Procedure Code but instead amended it to align with the pre-trial steps.

Section 175 now provides the final opportunity for a party to call and

mark unlisted or not properly listed witnesses and documents at the trial.

A party who could not invoke the provisions of section 142D may also

invoke this provision depending on the facts and circumstances of the

case. Section 175, as presently stands, reads as follows:

175(1). No witness shall be called on behalf of any party unless such

witness shall have been included in the list of witnesses previously

filed in court by such party as provided by subparagraph (i) of

25

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

paragraph (b) of section 79B or permitted by court under section

142D:

Provided, however, that the court may in its discretion, if special

circumstances appear to it to render such a course advisable in the

interests of justice, permit a witness to be examined, although such

witness may not have been included in such list aforesaid.

Provided also that any party to an action may be called as a witness

without his name having been included in any such list.

(2) A document which is required to be included in the list of

documents filed in court by a party as provided by subparagraph (ii)

of paragraph (b) of section 79B and which is not so included or not

permitted by court under section 142D shall not, without the leave

of the court, be received in evidence at the trial of the action:

Provided that nothing in this subsection shall apply to documents

produced for cross examination of the witnesses of the opposite

party or handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory.

(3) Where an order is made under this section, the court shall take

into consideration any order made under section 142B.

The question of law on which leave to appeal was granted, i.e. whether

both the High Court of Civil Appeal and the District Court erred in law by

upholding the objection to the marking of deed No. 10421 as P1 and

rejecting the entire list of witnesses and documents, is answered in the

affirmative. Consequently, the order of the District Court dated

29.11.2021 and the judgment of the High Court dated 28.04.2023 are set

aside and the appeal is allowed but without costs. The District Judge will

now permit the deed to be marked in evidence and proceed with the trial

in accordance with the law.

26

SC/APPEAL/1/2025

Let me conclude this judgment with the insightful words of Justice

Wijeratne in Kandiah v. Wiswanathan [1991] 1 Sri LR 269 at 278, which

remain profoundly relevant and instructive to this day and beyond:

It happens frequently in District Court trials that material witnesses

and documents have not been listed as required by law. The failure

to do so entails considerable hardship, delay and expense to parties

and contributes to laws delays. It should be stressed that a special

responsibility is cast on attorneys-at-law, who should endeavour to

obtain full instructions, from parties in time to enable them to list all

material witnesses and documents as required by law.
