"There  can  be  no  rigid  or  universally  applicable  rule  governing  the"
"circumstances  under  which  a 
trial  Judge  should  permit  unlisted"
"witnesses to be called or unlisted documents to be marked. Each decision"
"must be made based on the unique facts and circumstances of the case,"
"carefully  weighing  the  competing  interests  at  stake.  The  Judge  must"
"balance  the  potential  irreparable  loss  that  may  be  caused  to  the  party"
"seeking such permission if it is refused, against the substantial prejudice"
"that may be caused to the opposing party if it is granted. Ultimately, the"

"The  case  of  Mashreq  Bank  v.  Arunaselam  [2007]  BLR  20  serves  as  an"
"instructive example of how trial Judges should exercise their discretion"
"under section 175 of the Civil Procedure Code. In this case, the plaintiff"
"bank  had  originally listed  its  credit  officer  as  a  witness,  but  before  his"
"evidence could be recorded, he left the bank. During the trial, the bank"
"filed  an  additional 
list  naming  the  new  credit  officer  as  a  witness."
"Although this was clearly contrary to section 121 of the Civil Procedure"
"Code, the trial Judge overruled the objection to calling the new officer,"
"exercising  discretion  under  section  175.  On  appeal,  this  decision  was"
"upheld on the basis that no prejudice was caused to the defendant by"
"calling  the  succeeding  officer  as  both  were  intended  to  present  official"
"documents. Justice Wimalachandra endorsed the view expressed by the"
"trial  Judge  in  the  impugned  order  that  when  official  documents  are"
"produced, it is the documents which are material and not the person who"
"produces them."
