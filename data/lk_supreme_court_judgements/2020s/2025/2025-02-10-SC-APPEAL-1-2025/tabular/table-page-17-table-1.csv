"17"
"paramount consideration is the ascertainment of the truth and not"
"the  readily  understandable  desire  of  a  litigant  to  be  placed  at  a"
"tactical “advantage” by reason of some technicality. In my opinion"
"the learned Judge has not properly exercised the discretion vested"
"in  him  by  section  175,  and  this  Court  is  entitled  to  reverse  his"
"decision."
