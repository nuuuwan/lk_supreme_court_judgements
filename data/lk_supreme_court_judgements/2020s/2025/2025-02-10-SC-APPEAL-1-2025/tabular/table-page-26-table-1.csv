"Wijeratne in Kandiah v. Wiswanathan [1991] 1 Sri LR 269 at 278, which"
"remain profoundly relevant and instructive to this day and beyond:"
"It happens frequently in District Court trials that material witnesses"
"and documents have not been listed as required by law. The failure"
"to do so entails considerable hardship, delay and expense to parties"
"and contributes to laws delays. It should be stressed that a special"
"responsibility is cast on attorneys-at-law, who should endeavour to"
"obtain full instructions, from parties in time to enable them to list all"
"material witnesses and documents as required by law."
