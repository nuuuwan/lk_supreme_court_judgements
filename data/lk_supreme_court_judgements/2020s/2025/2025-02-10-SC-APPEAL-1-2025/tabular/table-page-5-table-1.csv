"the  action  shall  file  the  list  of  witnesses  and  documents  not  less  than"
"fifteen days before the date fixed for the trial of an action."
"The  phrase  “fifteen  days  before  the  date  fixed  for  the  trial”  has  been"
"correctly interpreted in a number of cases to mean fifteen days before the"
"date first fixed for the trial and not fifteen days before the date the case"
"is actually taken up for the trial."
"This  interpretation  is  consistent  with  the  other  provisions  of  the  law."
"According to section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code as it stood prior to"
"the  Civil  Procedure Code  (Amendment) Act,  No.  8  of  2017, on  the  date"
"fixed for the filing of the answer of the defendant or where replication is"
"permitted, on the date fixed for the filing of such replication, and whether"
"the same is filed or not, “the court shall appoint a date for the trial of the"
"action”. After section 80 was replaced with a new section by Act No. 8 of"
"2017, section 80 stated that on the date the case is called to fix the date"
"of trial, “the court shall appoint a date for the trial of the action”. Section"
"80 was repealed and replaced by a new section under Act No. 29 of 2023."
"Section 82 addresses postponements of the trial. According to section 80"
"read with section 82, the Court can fix a date for the trial of the action"
"only once. Thereafter, the trial can be postponed if it cannot be taken up"
"or concluded on the scheduled date."
"In Rogers Agencies (Pvt) Ltd v. People’s Merchant Bank Ltd [2005] 3 Sri LR"
"210  at  213,  in  reference  to  section  121  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code,"
"Justice  Somawansa  stated  that  “the  meaning  assigned  to  the  words"
"‘before the day fixed for the hearing’ is the first date on which the trial is"
"fixed for hearing. The meaning of the aforesaid words is clear and no other"
"meaning could be assigned to the aforesaid words.”  Accordingly, it was"
"held that the additional list filed subsequent to the date the case was first"
"fixed  for  trial  was  clearly  not  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of"
"section 121(2) of the Civil Procedure Code."
