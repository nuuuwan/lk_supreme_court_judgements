"paid, and in cases in the Primary Courts shall state the amount of such cost. The"
"decree shall be signed by the Judge‚Äù."
"It is a well-established legal principle that the decree must be consistent with"
"the  judgment.  However,  it  is  equally  recognised  in  law  that  interest  may  be"
"awarded in the decree even if it is not expressly mentioned in the judgment. The"
"learned District Judge is vested with the discretion to grant interest, and there"
"is ample judicial authority supporting both positions."
"With respect to the interpretation of Section 192(2), which addresses instances"
"where the decree is silent on interest, the presumption that interest has not been"
"awarded applies specifically to the decree. In the present case, however, it is not"
"the decree but the judgment that is silent on the question of interest."
"It  is  also  pertinent  to  note  that  while  the  decree  is  typically  prepared  by  the"
"judgment creditor, the trial judge is obligated to examine and sign it. In this case,"
"the learned trial judge has duly signed the decree, indicating that he would have"
"reviewed its contents, including the provision for legal interest. His decision not"
"to amend or reject that portion of the decree demonstrates his acceptance of the"
"interest awarded. Had he disagreed with its inclusion, he would not have affixed"
"his signature to the decree."
"This  Court  must  also  take  into  account  the  nature  and  circumstances  of  the"
"damages awarded. The compensation in question has been granted to a young"
"girl who suffered permanent disability due to an injury to her left leg as a result"
"of a tragic accident that occurred in 2008. The harm endured by the Respondent"
"is not only severe and life-altering but has also affected her from a very early age,"
"thereby amplifying the long-term consequences of her injury. The extent of the"
"injuries  suffered  by  the  Respondent  has  been  evidenced  by  the  document"
"marked  P6  and  the  testimony  of  Dr.  Wasatha  Perera  who  is  a  consultant"
"Orthopedic Surgeon attached to the National Hospital."
