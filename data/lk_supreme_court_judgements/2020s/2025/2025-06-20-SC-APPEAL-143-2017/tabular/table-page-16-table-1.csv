"not mentioned about it in the Judgment.‚Äù I am inclined to agree with this view of"
"the Learned High Court Judge, as now, a further period of 9 years has lapsed"
"since the appeal from the decision of the High Court of Civil Appeal in Colombo."
"Legal interest is a discretionary remedy awarded by the judge on a case-by-case"
"basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each matter and cannot"
"be  applied  as  a  rigid,  formulaic  standard.  In  the  present  case,  denying  the"
"Respondent an award of legal interest would not only be inconsistent with the"
"principles of equity but would also amount to a grave injustice, particularly in"
"light of the prolonged and intense suffering she has endured. The Respondent"
"has been permanently disabled due to the unfortunate incident at the heart of"
"this litigation, an outcome that has not  only altered the course of her life but"
"also  subjected  her  to  immense  physical  pain,  emotional  trauma,  and  social"
"hardship over an extended period."
"The  nature  and  severity  of  her  injuries  have  led  to  the  loss  of  her  mobility,"
"autonomy, and livelihood, resulting in a diminished quality of life. She has faced"
"daily physical discomfort, the psychological burden of living with a permanent"
"disability,  and  the  emotional  anguish  of  depending  on  others  for  basic  needs."
"This  is  not  merely  a  matter  of  financial  compensation,  but  of  recognising  the"
"suffering, loss of dignity, and emotional toll inflicted upon her. Legal interest, in"
"this  context,  serves  not  only  as  a  compensatory  mechanism  for  the  delayed"
"receipt  of  justice  but  also  as  a  symbolic  acknowledgment  of  her  pain  and"
"perseverance. Therefore, considering the totality of circumstances, it would be"
"wholly inequitable to withhold such a sum from the Respondent after all these"
"years."
"Considering  all  matters  above,  I  answer  the  question  of  law  raised  by  the"
"Appellants  in  the  negative.  For  all  the  above  reasons,  I  hold  that  there  is  no"
"ground to interfere with the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge."
