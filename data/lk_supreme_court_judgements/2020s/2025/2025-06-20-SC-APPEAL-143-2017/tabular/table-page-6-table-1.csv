"The  Learned  Counsel  for  the  Appellants  submitted  that  the  Learned  District"
"Court Judge has refused to grant interest in his judgement as he had awarded"
"a sum of Rs. 2,600,150/- alongside the cost of the lawsuit as a matter of relief."
"There  was  no  reference  to  interest  anywhere  in  the  judgement  as  a  matter  of"
"relief.  The  Appellants  submitted  that  the  sum  of  money  expounded  in  the"
"judgement was a sum of Rs. 2,600,150/- and cost the lawsuit and nothing more."
"The Appellants contended that the Learned District Court Judge has admitted"
"the decree containing interest and hence cannot reject the claim of interest by"
"the Respondent thereafter. The drawing up of the decree was an administrative"
"act and not a judicial act. The decree is drawn up by the Attorney at Law of the"
"Judgement  Creditor  (the  Respondent)  in  this  case  and  once  it  is  submitted  to"
"court it is journalised by the subject clerk and becomes part of the record subject"
"to objections of the judgement debtor."
