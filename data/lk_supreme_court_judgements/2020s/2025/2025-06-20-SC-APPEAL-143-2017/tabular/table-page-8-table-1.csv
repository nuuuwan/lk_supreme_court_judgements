"The essence of interest in the opinion of Lord Wright, in Riches v Westminster"
"Bank Ltd [1947] 1 All ER 469, 472, is that it is a payment which becomes due"
"because the creditor has not had his money at the due date. It may be regarded"
"either  as  representing  the  profit  he  might  have  made  if  he  had  the  use  of  the"
"money,  or,  conversely,  the  loss  he  suffered  because  he  had  not  that  use.  The"
"general idea is that he is entitled to compensation for the deprivation; the money"
"due to creditor was not paid, or, in other words, was withheld from him by the"
"debtor after the time when payment should have been made, in breach of his"
"legal  rights,  and  interest  was  a  compensation  whether  the  compensation  was"
"liquidated under an agreement or statute."
