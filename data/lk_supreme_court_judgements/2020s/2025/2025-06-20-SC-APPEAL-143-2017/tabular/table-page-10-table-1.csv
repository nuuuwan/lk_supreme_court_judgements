"I
n the case of Central Bank of India v Ravindra and Others [2002] 1 SCC 367,"
"the  Indian  Supreme  Court  examined  at  length  the  distinction  between  penal"
"interest  and  interest  and  held  that:  Penal  interest  differs  fundamentally  from"
"ordinary interest: while regular interest compensates for the time value of money"
"and  is  based  on  the  doctrine  of  compensation,  penal  interest  is  a  punitive"
"measure  imposed  on  a  debtor  for  wrongful  delay  in  payment,  rooted  in  the"
"doctrine of penalty. It is not related to actual loss and cannot be capitalised or"
"charged more than once for the same period of default. As explained in Mulla on"
"the Code of Civil Procedure (1995), Section 34 CPC recognises three categories of"
"interest: (1) pre-suit interest, governed by substantive law and allowed either"
"by agreement, mercantile usage, statutory entitlement, or implied contract; (2)"
"interest pendente lite, from the filing of the suit to the decree, which lies within"
"the discretion of the court and is not considered a matter of substantive law; and"
"(3)  post-decree  or  future  interest,  from  the  date  of  the  decree  to  the  date  of"
"payment (or an earlier date set by the court), also discretionary and statutorily"
"capped at 6% per annum. The Indian Supreme Court in Secretary, Irrigation"
"Department, Government of Orissa & Ors. v. G.C. Roy  (1992) 1 SCC 508,"
"particularly  at  para  44(iv),  clarified  that  while  pendente  lite  and  post-decree"
"interest depend on the court's discretion, pre-suit interest must be awarded if"
"contractually agreed, subject to certain exceptions: if the rate is penal, unlawful"
"under money lending or usury laws, or deemed excessive and unfair by the court,"
"it may be modified. These well-established principles guide courts in balancing"
"contractual autonomy with fairness and statutory compliance."
