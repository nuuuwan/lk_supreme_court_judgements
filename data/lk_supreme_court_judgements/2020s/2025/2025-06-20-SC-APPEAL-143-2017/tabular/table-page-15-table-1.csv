"It is further relevant to note, that this case has been mired in litigation for over"
"seventeen  years.  This  prolonged  delay  underscores  the  very  rationale  for  the"
"existence  of  legal  interest,  to  ensure  that  judgment  creditors  are  not  unfairly"
"prejudiced by the passage of time, particularly when delays in the legal process"
"are  beyond  their  control  and  often  attributable  to  systemic  inefficiencies  or"
"procedural complexities."
"Legal  interest  operates  as  a  safeguard  against  the  erosion  of  the  real  value  of"
"damages due to inflation and the time value of money, and it ensures a degree"
"of fairness by compensating for the delay in the actual realisation of the awarded"
"sum. To deny interest in such circumstances would be to penalise the judgment"
"creditor who is an innocent victim, for the inefficiencies of the judicial process."
"Such  an  outcome  would  be  both  inequitable  and  contrary  to  the  principles  of"
"justice."
"In Mahipala v Martin Singho [2006] 2 Sri LR 272 the Plaintiff was awarded"
"damages  for  the  injuries  sustained  as  a  result  of  a  motor  accident  due  to  the"

"judgement of the District Court, having found no interest has been ordered to"
"the sum adjudged until payment in full, ex mero mutu ordered the same, stating"
"that the Courts needed to take into account “The inflation in the economy and the"
"depreciation of Sri Lankan Currency”."
"I refer to the last paragraph of the judgement of the Learned High Court Judge"
"who stated that “The plaintiff instituted the action in January 2004. A judgment"
"of the District Court was delivered in March 2008. Appeal Judgment was delivered"
"in April 2015. Between then and now nearly 13 years have lapsed for no fault of"
"the plaintiff. The date of institution of the action is the date upon which the rights"
"of parties are determined, and when the decree fixes the amount of damages due,"
"they  may  be  taken  as  fixed  as  on  the  institution  of  the  action,  and  it  is  very"
"reasonable, in the unique facts and circumstances of this case that legal interest"
"is allowed on the decreed sum irrespective of the fact that the District Judge has"
