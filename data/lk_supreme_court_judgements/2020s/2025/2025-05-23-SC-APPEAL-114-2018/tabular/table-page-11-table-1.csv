"by the Appellant which was mentioned in Journal entry No.14 dated 20.12.2007, the Court had"
"made the said previous order to send the said documents in Case No. 25123/T to the EQD along"
"with some documents in the CID. Thus, it appears that the Counsel for the Respondent moved"
"the District Court on 10.10.2008 to carry out the said previous order made in accordance with"
"the application made on behalf of the Appellant. Thus, it is the prime duty of the Appellant to"
"file commission papers to get what he asked from the Court and for which it seems that the"
"Respondent lawyer too had contributed later on. Now it appears that the Appellant is trying put"
"the blame on the Respondent for not sending those documents mentioned in the Appellant’s"
"said motion to the EQD. It seems even the learned additional District Judge also have found"
"fault with the Respondent, without considering that the burden was on the Appellant to remove"
"any suspicion attached to the Last Will and to prove that it was an act and deed of the Testator"
"named in the Petition."
"O
n the other hand, there is no clear admission by the Respondent that the documents in Case"
"No.25123/T contained the true signatures of the Testatrix - see the answers given on pages 281"
"and 282 of the brief. It appears that she knew that there are papers filed in that case in her"
"mother’s name but if there is any specific knowledge as to the genuineness of those purported"
"signatures on the documents in Case No.25123/T, that knowledge should have  been with the"
"Appellant and his lawyer who also attested the Last Will since said lawyer Padmini Caldera"
"appears  to  be  the  lawyer  who  appeared  on  behalf  of  the  Testatrix  in  that  case.  Now  it  is"
"important  to  observe  what  the  said  lawyer  Padmini  Caldera  had  stated  regarding  the  said"
"documents  filed  in  the  said  Case  No.25123/T.  At  page  169  of  the  brief,  during  the  cross"
"examination when questioned above the signature on the Last Will suggesting that it was not"
"the signature of the Testatrix, aforesaid lawyer had voluntarily come out and had said that by"
"placing forged signatures Testatrix had been mentioned as a petitioner in that case No.25123/T"
"and there are lot of forged signatures of the Testatrix in that case. Learned additional District"
"Judge  found  fault  with  Respondent  for  not  sending  those  documents  to  the  EQD  and  the"
"Appellant wants to place the blame on the Respondent not sending them. The lawyer for the"
"Appellant (the Propounder of the Will) who also appeared for the Testatrix in the said Case"
"No.25123/T, herself has stated in evidence that the Testatrix’s signature in the said case had"
"been forged to mention her as the Petitioner in that case indicating that someone else had placed"
"the Testatrix’s signature on the documents in that case. It may be a reason for the Appellant"
"and his lawyer, even though, they moved to send those documents to the EQD first, not to send"
"them to the EQD knowing that true signatures of the Testatrix may be used to challenge the"
"Last Will. It is quite interesting to see that the same lawyer had attested the impugned Last Will"
"in the case in hand and she also became the registered attorney for the Propounder of the Last"
"Will in the case in hand till she revoked her proxy after giving evidence as aforesaid. For the"
"reasons  discussed  above  I  cannot  find  fault  with  the  Respondent  for  not  sending  the  said"
"documents to the EQD. I repeat that the burden was on the Appellant to prove that the Last"
"Will was the act and deed of the Testatrix and also to wipe out suspicion that may attach to the"
"Last  Will.  I  also  observe  that  the  Appellant  have  not  asked  permission  to  lead  evidence  in"
"rebuttal  other  than  blaming  the  Respondent  who  had  no  burden  to  remove  any  suspicion"
"attached to the Last Will. Thus, if there is any fault on the Respondent for not sending them to"
"the EQD, the fault of the Appellant, for not sending even after moving court to send it to the"
