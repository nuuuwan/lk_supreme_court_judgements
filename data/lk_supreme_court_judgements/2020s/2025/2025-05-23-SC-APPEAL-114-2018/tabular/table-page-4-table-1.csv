"•","Even though, on the evidence of the EQD, it can be decided that the signature appearing"
"","in  the  Last  Will  is  not  the  signature  of  the  Testatrix,  the  EQD's  report  has  to  be"
"","analytically considered together with other documents which had been tendered to the"
"","District Court."
"•","Respondent is the one who sent the Last Will to the EQD and the documents sent for"
"","comparison were documents issued to the Samurdhi officer and those documents are"
"","not admitted documents by the Appellant. She has not tendered any document to the"
"","EQD which has been admitted by the Appellant. The Testatrix was the Petitioner in"
"","case No.25123/T and the signatures placed in the documents of that case have been"
"","admitted by the parties, but the Respondent has not sent those documents to the EQD."
"•","It cannot be concluded that the Samurdhi officer is acquainted with the signatures of all"
"","who reside in Obesekarapura to identify them where there are about 1600 households"
"","within that division. Even though, the said Samurdhi officer had stated that the Testatrix"
"","placed her signatures before her, it is clear that the said officer did not know the name"
"","of the people who lived close to the house of Testatrix. Aforesaid officer had admitted"
"","that she came after perusing the necessary documents."
"•","For those reasons mentioned above, the additional District Court cannot be satisfied"
"","that  the  documents  taken  from  the  Samurdhi  Officer  contain  the  signatures  of  the"
"","Testatrix. Hence, the correct documents have not been sent for comparison to the EQD."
"","Thus, based on EQD report it cannot be decided that the signature found in the Last"
"","Will is not the signature of the Testatrix."
"•","The Testatrix had signed the Last Will before the Notary Public and two witnesses and"
"","the  Notary  Public  in  evidence  has  stated  that  she  knew  the  Testatrix  without  any"
"","contradiction. It is also stated in evidence that the Testatrix was mentally sound.  Even"
"","the witnesses to the Last Will have corroborated the said facts."
