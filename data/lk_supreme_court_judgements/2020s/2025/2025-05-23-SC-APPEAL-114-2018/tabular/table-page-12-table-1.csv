"EQD  first,  is  more  serious  than  that  of  the  Respondent.  As  said  before,  the  Responden’s"
"application to send them to EQD was based on the order obtained by the Appellant previously."
"F
urther to the above, the EQD officer who gave evidence has considerable experience and had"
"satisfactorily explained reasons for his decisions. Even the learned additional District Judge"
"had stated that the EQD had correctly done his task- vide page 341. The learned High Court"
"Judges correctly observed that the EQD had clearly found that the signature on the Last Will"
"was placed by a person who could have controlled the pen in a better or stronger manner than"
"the  person  who  placed  the  signatures  on  the  documents  sent  for  comparison  indicating  an"
"attempt made by a person having a stronger hand to fake the way an older and weaker person"
"placing the signature."
"T
he  Appellant  has  brought  this  Court’s  attention  to  the  cases  of  Charles  de  Silva  Vs"
"Ariyawathie de Silva (1987) 1 Sri L R 261 where the Appellate Court found the lower court"
"wrong  for  acting  on  the  evidence  of  the  handwriting  expert  as  the  genuineness  of  the"
"comparison material on which the EQD based his opinion was in dispute and such material had"
"not been proved. In the matter in hand the comparison documents have been proved by calling"
"the Samurdhi officer and it should also be observed that there was no objection reiterated to"
"those documents at the close of the case of the Respondent. Further, the said decision indicates"
"that there should be reasonable number of specimens of signatures placed about the same time"
"on similar material and circumstances using similar pen or pencil etc. The specimens used were"
"within the last 5 or 6 years prior to the Last Will and I cannot find that the EQD was questioned"
"during cross examination on such grounds to indicate  through evidence any insufficiency of"
"the specimens sent for comparison due to the number of specimens sent or on any other ground."
"The EQD had said that he himself made the photograph for comparison and thus any need to"
"prove those photographs does not arise and the Appellant had not challenged the correctness"
"of those photographs. It must be noted that this is an expert witness. Criteria referred to in old"
"cases may not suit to evaluate the present-day situations with the development of technology"
"and knowledge unless it is shown through evidence that same criteria still apply. Thus, in my"
"view, the decision in Charles de Silva case(supra) cannot be used in favour of the Appellant."
"T
he  Appellant  also  has  relied  on  the  decision  of  Lily  Perera  Vs  Chandani  Perera  quoted"
"above in support of a different ground. The said decision states that the hand writing expert’s"
"evidence  is  relevant  but  it  is  only  to  assist  Court  to  form  an  opinion.  It  is  true  that  expert"
"evidence is only to assist the Court and the court must form its opinion. As discussed above,"
"the  initial  suspicion  attached  to  the  Last  Will  due  to  the  associated  circumstances  had  been"
"aggravated by the expert’s evidence placed by the Respondent creating a serious doubt as to"
"the genuineness of the Last Will. The burden was on the Appellant to remove such suspicion"
"to satisfy the conscience of Court. The learned additional District Judge as discussed above"
"clearly misdirected himself by considering irrelevant facts and not considering relevant facts"
"in evaluating evidence relating to the specimen documents sent for comparison to the EQD."
"Thus, there was a question not only regarding the decision on facts but whether the evaluation"
"of facts was done according to law. In such an occasion the Court with appellate powers has to"
"interfere. On the other hand, since the decision of the learned additional District Judge does not"
