"•","The learned additional District Judge’s statement that the burden is on the Respondent"
"","to  prove  that  the  signature  in  the  Last  Will  is  not  that  of  L.  D.  Premawathie,  the"
"","Testatrix, is not correct. The Appellant, the Propounder of the Last Will, had both the"
"","initial burden of establishing that the Last Will is genuine and to remove any doubts"
"","that may arise from the conscience of the Court. Thus, the Propounder of the Last Will"
"","has to prove that the Last Will is an act or deed of the Testatrix while having the burden"
"","to remove any suspicion attached to the Last Will."
"•","Samurdhi Officer providing evidence via the production of the files and the existence"
"","of sufficient material, satisfies that documents sent for comparison to the EQD are not"
"","forged documents but contain genuine signatures of L. D. Premawathie, the Testatrix."
"•","EQD has found that the signature in the Last Will, which purports to be the signature"
"","of Testatrix, had been placed by a person who could have controlled the pen in a better"
"","or stronger manner than the person who placed the signature on the documents sent for"
"","comparison. Thus, signature in the Last Will shows an attempt made by a person having"
"","a stronger hand to fake the way an older and weaker person placing the signature. The"
"","explanation provided by the EQD during cross examination, as well as the conclusions"
"","he reached, were satisfactory. (In other words, the learned High Court Judges opined"
"","that  the  learned  additional  District  Judge  should  have  formed  his  opinion  as  to  the"
"","genuineness of the signature of the Testatrix found in the Last Will in accordance with"
"","the findings and conclusions of the EQD and not contrary to it)."
