"1.  The  Plaintiff  -  Appellant  seeks  by  way  of  this  appeal  to  set  aside  and  vary  the"
"judgement of the Commercial High Court dated 10th September 2013, wherein the"
"learned High Court judge has dismissed the Plaintiff’s action on its 2nd, 3rd and 4th"
"causes of action but has allowed the 1st cause of action. In a laconic judgement the"
"learned High Court judge observes that the reliefs claimed on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th"
"causes of action depended on a pending action in the Magistrate’s Court and as"
"such, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th causes of action cannot be adjudicated upon."
