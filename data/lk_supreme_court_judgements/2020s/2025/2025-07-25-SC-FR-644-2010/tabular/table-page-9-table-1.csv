"","20. Accordingly, this Court is satisfied that the Detainee has  established, by"
"","clear and cogent evidence, that his fundamental right under Article 11 was"
"","violated by the 4th, 6th, 7th and 7A Respondents, for which the State is also"
"vicariously liable.",""
"Violation of Article 13(2) – Unlawful and Arbitrary Detention",""
"","21. Article 13(2) provides that “no person shall be held in custody or detained"
"","except upon and in terms of an order made by a judge according to procedure"
"","established  by  law.”  Compliance  with  the  terms  of  a  detention  order,"
"","including the place and duration of detention, is a mandatory requirement."
"","22. It is undisputed that the Detainee was transferred to the Boossa Detention"
"","Camp  on  14/09/2010,  notwithstanding  a  valid  and  subsisting  detention"
"","order (P11E) dated 09/08/2010 that required his detention at the 6th Floor"
"of the New Secretariat Building, Colombo 01 until 08/11/2010.",""
"","23. The next detention  order  authorizing his detention at Boossa was issued"
"","only on 07/11/2010, thereby leaving a period of 54 days (from 14/09/2010 to"
"","06/11/2010) during which the Detainee was held in custody without lawful"
"authority, and in clear violation of the detention order.",""
"","24. The  explanation  offered  by  the  1st  Respondent—that  transfers  between"
