1. This application concerns the alleged infringement of the fundamental

rights guaranteed under Articles 11 and 13(2) of the Constitution by officers

of the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID), against a former

Superintendent of Police, who, at the time of arrest, was a serving officer in

the Sri Lanka Police.

2. The Petitioner, an Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of the Detainee

(hereinafter referred to as "the Detainee"), seeks a declaration that the

Detainee's fundamental rights were violated by reason of his unlawful

detention and the infliction of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading

treatment, while in the custody of the TID from 12th August 2009 to 7th

February 2011.

P a g e 4 | 13

3. Leave to proceed was granted by this Court on 19th July 2011 for alleged

violations of Article 11 (freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment) and Article 13(2) (freedom from arbitrary

detention contrary to procedure established by law).

Factual Background

4. The Detainee joined the Sri Lanka Police Department as a Probationary

Assistant Superintendent of Police on 01st February 2001 and was

thereafter promoted to the rank of Superintendent of Police on 01st

February 2009. He had served in multiple regions, including conflict-

affected areas such as Jaffna and Point Pedro, and was the recipient of

commendations and awards, including the Poorna Bhoomi Medal and

several IGP commendations.

5. On 12th August 2009, while serving in the Gampaha Division, the Detainee

was summoned to the office of the Senior Superintendent of Police,

Gampaha, and arrested by officers of the Terrorist Investigation Division.

He was not informed of the reasons for his arrest, nor was a receipt issued

to him at the time. That same night, he was taken to his residence in

Kottawa, which was thoroughly searched by TID officers. Certain items

were seized, some without receipts.

6. The Detainee was then transported back to Colombo and held at the TID

facility under harsh and degrading conditions. He was made to sleep on a

chair for three days. His statements were recorded intermittently from 15th

P a g e 5 | 13

to 18th August 2009, with frequent interruptions, revisions, and threats.

The statements were allegedly recorded in a language unfamiliar to the

Detainee, and not explained or read back to him.

7. During this period, and on several other occasions, the Detainee was

allegedly subjected to sustained physical abuse, including beatings to his

head, face, and feet; blows using books and clubs; and assaults to the soles

of his feet with a wooden stick. These acts were attributed to the 4th and 7A

Respondents, both members of the TID.

8. It is further alleged that the Detainee suffered injuries including

deterioration of eyesight, persistent nosebleeds, gum swelling, and dental

damage. These injuries, he maintains, were direct consequences of the

physical abuse inflicted upon him while in TID custody.

9. On 08th July 2010, after his repeated refusal to provide a confession in the

manner desired by the investigating officers, the Detainee was burnt with

lit cigarettes by the 6th and 7th Respondents. Medical evidence, including

a Medico-Legal Report submitted by Dr. (Mrs.) K.K. Joozar, corroborates

the presence of multiple burn scars on his body consistent with the

Detainees allegations.

10. Although the Detainee was produced before Judicial Medical Officers on

three earlier occasions on 26/02/2010, 11/03/2010, and 31/03/2010those

reports (marked 1R2, 1R3, and 1R4) did not reflect such injuries. The

discrepancy is attributed to the failure of the JMO to examine him

P a g e 6 | 13

meaningfully and the Detainees fear of reprisal if he disclosed the extent of

the abuse, particularly as TID officers were either present during the

examination or stationed outside the examination room.

11. The Detainee was subjected to repeated threats of death and threats

against his wife, who was then suffering from a serious spinal condition. In

fear for her safety and his own life, the Detainee ultimately wrote multiple

confessions as dictated by TID officers. It is contended that these

purported confessions were fabricated, obtained under duress, and

backdated to conceal the circumstances of their extraction.

12. Despite multiple detention orders issued under Section 9(1) of the

Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No. 48 of 1979, the

Detainee was transferred to Boossa Detention Camp on 14/09/2010, in

violation of a valid detention order which specified the 6th Floor of the New

Secretariat Building, Colombo, as the place of detention until 08/11/2010.

This transfer occurred without lawful authority, and a subsequent detention

order to detain the Detainee at Boossa was only issued on 07/11/2010,

creating a period of 54 days of unlawful detention.

13. On 07/02/2011, an indictment was finally served on the Detainee in High

Court Case No. HC 5526/11. On the same day, the Detainee was allegedly

threatened once again by the 1st and 6th Respondents, demanding that he

plead guilty or risk being returned to TID custody.

P a g e 7 | 13

Violation of Article 11 Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment

14. Article 11 of the Constitution mandates in unequivocal terms that no

person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment. This is an absolute right and admits of no

exceptions, regardless of the identity of the person or the gravity of the

allegations against them.

15. The jurisprudence of this Court has consistently held that even suspects

accused of grave offences are entitled to the full protection of their

fundamental rights. As was stated in Ansalin Fernando v. Sarath

Perera and Others,1 the absence of medical evidence is not fatal to a claim

under Article 11, and an allegation can be established even in the absence

of medically supported injuries.

16. In the present case, however, the allegation of torture is not merely

supported by testimonial evidence but also by corroborative medical

evidence. The Medico-Legal Report tendered by Dr. (Mrs.) K.K. Joozar, who

examined the Detainee upon an order of the High Court, records scars

compatible with cigarette burns, injuries which the Respondents have failed

to credibly explain. The prior medico-legal reports marked 1R2, 1R3, and

1R4, tendered by the Respondents, were all dated before the date of the

alleged burning incident on 08/07/2010 and are therefore of no evidentiary

value in refuting the subsequent infliction of torture.

1 (1992) 1 Sri.LR 411

P a g e 8 | 13

17. The Detainee's narrative that he was coerced into making a confession,

including threats to his life and the safety of his wife, is further borne out

by contemporaneous events, including her filing of a habeas corpus

application in HCWA 01/2010, and her documented spinal surgerya fact

known to the TID officers. The repeated extraction of confessions under

duress, the backdating of statements, and the use of physical violence to

enforce compliance amount to conduct that squarely falls within the scope

of torture as contemplated by Article 11.

18. The burden to provide a lawful justification or credible alternative

explanation for the injuries observed while in state custody rests on the

Respondents. The 6th and 7th Respondents, who were directly implicated

in the acts of burning and assault, deny the allegations in general terms,

but do not offer any explanation as to how the injuries occurred. The State,

being in custody of the Detainee during the relevant period, bears a

heightened duty of care, and the absence of a satisfactory explanation leads

to the inescapable inference that the Detainee was subjected to torture

while in state custody.

19. Furthermore, the specific methods describedbeatings to the head and

face, slapping, burning with cigarettes, deprivation of sleep, exposure to

physical discomfort in confined, unventilated cells, and the threat of

extrajudicial killingall establish a pattern of cruel, inhuman and

P a g e 9 | 13

degrading treatment, which cannot be justified under any pretext of

national security or emergency.

20. Accordingly, this Court is satisfied that the Detainee has established, by

clear and cogent evidence, that his fundamental right under Article 11 was

violated by the 4th, 6th, 7th and 7A Respondents, for which the State is also

vicariously liable.

Violation of Article 13(2) Unlawful and Arbitrary Detention

21. Article 13(2) provides that no person shall be held in custody or detained

except upon and in terms of an order made by a judge according to procedure

established by law. Compliance with the terms of a detention order,

including the place and duration of detention, is a mandatory requirement.

22. It is undisputed that the Detainee was transferred to the Boossa Detention

Camp on 14/09/2010, notwithstanding a valid and subsisting detention

order (P11E) dated 09/08/2010 that required his detention at the 6th Floor

of the New Secretariat Building, Colombo 01 until 08/11/2010.

23. The next detention order authorizing his detention at Boossa was issued

only on 07/11/2010, thereby leaving a period of 54 days (from 14/09/2010 to

06/11/2010) during which the Detainee was held in custody without lawful

authority, and in clear violation of the detention order.

24. The explanation offered by the 1st Respondentthat transfers between

authorized places of detention may be made for investigative and

administrative purposesis untenable. As held by this Court in

P a g e 10 | 13

Dissanayake v. Superintendent Mahara Prison and Others2,

compliance with all terms of a detention order, including the designated

place of detention, is mandatory, and non-compliance is not excused except

in exceptional circumstances. No such exceptional circumstance has been

demonstrated in this case.

25. Further, the Respondents have not furnished any detention order or

judicial order covering the said period or explained why a new order was not

obtained. In the absence of such justification, the transfer to Boossa prior to

07/11/2010 amounts to arbitrary detention in contravention of Article 13(2).

26. It must also be noted that the Detainee was arrested on 12/08/2009 and

remained in detention for nearly 18 months without being produced before

a judge or being served with an indictment until 07/02/2011. Such

protracted pre-indictment detention cannot be reconciled with the

requirement of procedure established by law.

27. The Detainees long-term isolation, denial of access to medical care, and the

failure to comply with judicial directions to produce him before medical

officers further underscore the arbitrariness and lawlessness that tainted

the Respondents conduct.

28. Accordingly, this Court finds that the Detainee has discharged the burden

of proving a violation of his right under Article 13(2) of the Constitution,

2 (1991) 2 Sri.LR 247.

P a g e 11 | 13

and holds that the 1st to 8th Respondents and the State are liable for the

unlawful and arbitrary detention of the Detainee.

Conclusions

29. Upon a comprehensive consideration of the pleadings, oral and

documentary evidence, and the legal principles governing fundamental

rights under the Constitution, this Court finds that the Petitioner, acting on

behalf of the Detainee, has established beyond doubt that:

The 4th, 6th, 7th and 7A Respondents directly inflicted torture and

inhuman and degrading treatment on the Detainee, in contravention of

Article 11 of the Constitution;

The 1st to 8th Respondents, in their capacity as officers of the State, were

complicit in or failed to prevent the unlawful detention of the Detainee in

violation of Article 13(2);

The State, as the constitutionally recognized custodian of the fundamental

rights of all persons, is vicariously liable for the wrongful acts of its officers

committed under color of official authority.

Award of Relief

30. In determining the appropriate relief, this Court is mindful of the grave e

violations, the duration and severity of the torture, the psychological and

P a g e 12 | 13

physical trauma endured by the Detainee, and the institutional failure to

provide safeguards guaranteed by law.

31. This Court also takes cognizance of the fact that the Detainee was a serving

Superintendent of Police, thereby rendering the violation particularly

egregious. The States failure to observe the basic safeguards in treating one

of its own officers signifies a profound erosion of the rule of law.

32. Accordingly, acting under Article 126(4) of the Constitution, this Court

directs the State to pay a sum of Rupees 30,000/- (Rupees

33. Thirty Thousand) as compensation to the Detainee for the violation of his

fundamental rights.

34. In addition, each of the following Respondents shall personally pay

compensation as follows:

The 4th Respondent: Rs. 200,000/-

The 6th Respondent : Rs. 300,000/-

The 7th Respondent: Rs.300,000/-

The 7A Respondent: Rs. 200,000/-

These sums shall be paid to the Detainee within four months from the date of

this judgment.

35. The Registrar is directed to forward a copy of this judgment to the Inspector

General of Police and the Attorney-General, in order that any necessary and

P a g e 13 | 13

appropriate disciplinary or prosecutorial action may be considered

against the said Respondents in accordance with the law.

36. In the result, we declare that the fundamental rights guaranteed

under Articles 11 and 13(2) of the Constitution have been infringed by

executive and administrative action and grant the Petitioner relief

accordingly.
