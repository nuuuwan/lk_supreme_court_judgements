SC/APPEAL/139/2015

Samayawardhena, J.

The appellant-employee filed this application before the Labour Tribunal of

Ampara under section 31B of the Industrial Disputes Act, seeking

reinstatement and/or confirmation of his appointment as permanent,

and/or arrears of salary, together with any other relief the Tribunal may

deem fit.

The appellant had been employed by the State Timber Corporation on a

contract basis. The respondent-employer sought dismissal of the

application, inter alia, on the ground that the appellants appointment to a

non-existent position designated as was made on the basis of

political affiliations.

However, following the inquiry, the Labour Tribunal found that the

appellants employment had been terminated unjustifiably. Nevertheless, it

declined to grant reinstatement, confirmation of the appointment as

permanent, or arrears of salary, and instead awarded compensation

equivalent to 18 months salary.

In his application to the Labour Tribunal, the appellant did not disclose the

amount of salary received. However, during cross-examination, he stated

that his monthly salary was Rs. 4,000. On that point, the Labour Tribunal

in its order states as follows:

.

. 4000/=

.

SC/APPEAL/139/2015

Being dissatisfied with the order of the Labour Tribunal, the appellant

preferred an appeal to the High Court, seeking to have the said order set

aside and to obtain the first and second reliefs prayed for in the application

to the Labour Tribunal, namely, reinstatement and/or confirmation of the

appointment as permanent.

The High Court did not interfere with the order of the Labour Tribunal,

having found it to be flawless. Accordingly, the High Court affirmed the

order of the Labour Tribunal and dismissed the appeal.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the High Court, the appellant

preferred an application for leave to appeal to this Court. A previous Bench

of this Court granted leave on several questions of law. However, at the

hearing of the appeal, learned counsel for the appellant informed Court that

the appellant no longer seeks reinstatement, but confines his claim to an

enhancement of compensation on the ground that the sum awarded by the

Labour Tribunal as compensation is inadequate.

I am unable to accept the argument that the compensation awarded to the

appellant by the Labour Tribunal is inadequate and ought to be enhanced.

As the superior courts have consistently held, although section 31C of the

Industrial Disputes Act empowers the Labour Tribunal to make such order

as may appear to the tribunal to be just and equitable, this does not entitle

the Tribunal to make any order which it thinks fit. While no rigid rules can

be laid down to define what constitutes a just and equitable order, it is well

established that, although such an order need not strictly conform to legal

principles, it must not be illegal, irrational or perverse. Depending on the

unique facts and circumstances of each case, the Tribunal must exercise

its discretion judiciously and make an order acceptable to both the

employee and employer. It must never be one-sided or disproportionate.

SC/APPEAL/139/2015

In this regard, the Labour Tribunal cannot be faulted for having been guided

by the specific reliefs sought by the employee in his application. As already

explained, the appellant did not expressly seek compensation, either before

the Labour Tribunal or the High Court. What he sought was reinstatement,

back wages, and confirmation of his appointment as permanent.

The Labour Tribunal justified its decision in the following manner:

,

.

.

SC/APPEAL/139/2015

1 1/2 18

.

(/44/449/2006)

(. 4000/= x 18 = 72000/=)

.

(/44/450/2006)

(. 4000/= x 18 = 72000/=)

.

Admittedly, the appellant was not a permanent employee, but was employed

there on an irregular appointment to a non-existing position on a

contractual or casual basis. In that backdrop, an order for reinstatement

was not possible. There were also no arrears of salary payable to the

appellant. In the totality of the circumstances, the Labour Tribunals

decision to award compensation equivalent to 18 months salary for loss of

employment is reasonable.

SC/APPEAL/139/2015

Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellants admission

during cross-examination that his monthly salary was Rs. 4,000 was

inaccurate when the entirety of the evidence is considered holistically.

However, it is too late in the day to seek an enhancement of compensation

on that basis, particularly when this issue was never raised either before

the Labour Tribunal or the High Court. It is purely a question of fact which

cannot be raised for the first time in the final Court.

I hold that, having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, the

decision of the Labour Tribunal in determining the amount of compensation

to be awarded is justifiable.

I dismiss the appeal but without costs.

As agreed, the parties in SC/APPEAL/140/2015 will abide by this

judgment.
