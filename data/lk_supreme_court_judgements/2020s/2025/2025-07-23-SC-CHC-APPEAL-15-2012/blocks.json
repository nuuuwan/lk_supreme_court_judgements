Further the learned Counsel for the Bank contended, no evidence has been led by the 2nd Defendant to contradict such position and when the time is right, steps will be taken to resurrect the case against the 1st Defendant Company and/or to proceed against the Liquidator if need be, and such course of action will have no effect on the claim against the 2nd Defendant, the Managing Director of the 1st Defendant Company, who signed the Guarantee Bond as a personal guarantee. The learned Counsel for the Bank further submitted, that presently the matter in issue is the claim against the Guarantor and Clause 19 of the Guarantee Bond expressly states, that if monies secured by the Guarantee Bond are not recoverable from the principle debtor due to any reason, including the operation of the law, that the monies can be recovered from the Guarantor and such process can be proceeded against the Guarantor in the first instance, and therefore moved that the 1st question of law be answered in favour of the Bank.

Upon non-payment of this loan the facility was re-scheduled in 1995. That is the facility that was secured by the 1st and 2nd defendants. Non honouring of the said facility was the cause of action pleaded by the bank against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants. The reference to the 1992 facility was not pleaded in the plaint. The guarantee given by the 3rd defendants in 1992 and the re-scheduling of the facility was not a part of the pleadings. The trial judge dismissed the case against the 3rd defendant holding that the transaction sued was the term loan granted in 1995 and not the facility given in 1992 and therefore there was no guarantee given by the 3rd Respondent nor the guarantee given in 1992 can be considered a continuing guarantee. The trial Judges findings were upheld by the High Court referring also to the principle of novation of contract. From the aforesaid, I see merit in the contention of the Counsel for the Respondent Bank, that Rumeco case can be distinguished from the facts of the Appeal before this Court. Furthermore, there is no dispute that a novation discharges the original obligation and the obligations accessory to it. In my view the facts of the instant Appeal do not fall within the realm of \u2018novation\u2019 and on such ground too, Rumeco case can be distinguished.

Finance Ltd. v Manchanayake (2000) 2 SLR 142. If I may apply the above principles to the present case, the Guarantee Bond P9 (which was for USD One Million) in Clause 1 (vii) defines \u2018monies\u2019 to include monies which may now and which shall from time to time become due, and remain unpaid to the Bank and also any advances, overdraft or any transaction whatsoever. As per Clause 3, the guarantee is a continuing security. Clause 4 refers to a termination of guarantee.",

    "text": "In the instant case, while no evidence was led by the Appellant that the continuing guarantee has been cancelled and / or discharged as per Clause 4 of the Guarantee Bond the contention of the Bank before this Court was that the most important feature of the Guarantee Bond P9, was that the Appellant, being a Director and Managing Director of the 1st Defendant Company had guaranteed the re-payment of sums overdue, and interest thereon upon a cafeteria of facilities given by the Bank, to the 1st Defendant Company, subject however, to a limit viz., USD One Million being the sum guaranteed. Having examined the Clauses of the Guarantee Bond, I see merit in the contention of the Bank, that the Guarantee Bond P9 is a continuing security and covers loans, facilities and all borrowings made by the 1st Defendant Company. It will not get discharged upon one such facility of the cafeteria of facilities and / or a loan being re-paid. I also observe that the Appellant, who is the Guarantor, has failed to lead any evidence to establish that the guarantee lapsed prior to signing of the Loan Agreement P5 and / or that the Guarantor, being the Managing Director of the 1st Defendant Company was completely unaware of the Loan Agreement executed in the year 2003. The Loan Agreement is the underlying contract upon which the Bank has sued the 1st Defendant Company. Though it would have been desirable to have referred to the Guarantee Bond",

    "text": "when the facility P5 was granted in the year 2003, non- reference in my view, does not necessarily mean that the security or the guarantee is not applicable. I reiterate that the principle that underlies a demand guarantee is that each contract is autonomous. Thus, when a demand is made on the guarantee and if the guarantor has failed to honour such demand, a cause of action arises. Even if a guarantor fails to acknowledge or fails to respond, a cause of action arises. These contentions are based on the principle that in business matters if a party receiving a letter disputes certain assertions contained in it, he must reply henceforth and failure to do so, amounts to an admission of the claim made therein.",

(2006) 1 SLR 230 Based upon the aforeatsted principles, the failure of the Appellant, in the present case, to respond to the Letter of Demand, in my view, heightens the liability of the Appellant, with regard to the sum claimed. Coming back to the autonomous nature of a demand guarantee, which is the crux of this case, it is evident that the rationale for honouring of a guarantee is paramount. It is an irrevocable obligation assumed by the guarantor. The reason for these principles to be embedded in our law is because the demand guarantees are the lifeblood of international trade and commerce. Such obligations are regarded as collateral to the underlying rights and obligations, free from interference by courts. The courts will intervene, in these relationships only in the case of a clear fraud. Ref: R.D. Harbottle (Mercantile) Ltd v National Westminster Bank Ltd and others [1976] QB 146 and Bolivinter Oil SA v Chase Manhattan Bank and others (1984) 1 All ER 351. The aforesaid jurisprudence has been accepted and embedded in our law. The judgements referred to below clearly recognises the propositions referred to above.",

This guarantee covers all facilities given to a debtor, whether it is given before or after granting of a facility or at the time of the execution of the facility. The guarantee will not lose its validity or extinguish its rights, because the underlying contract is re-adjusted or re-formulated or re-scheduled. In the said circumstances, I answer the 2nd question of law, as to whether the Plaintiff Bank is entitled to claim the money referred to in the plaint based on the Guarantee Bond, also in the affirmative. Conclusion I have already answered the 1st question of law, pertaining to the maintainability of this case specifically, in view of the Bank referring the claim to the Liquidator in the Winding Up application, in the affirmative and now I have answered the 2nd question of law also in the affirmative. Based on the aforesaid, and for reasons adumbrated in this judgement, I see no reason to interfere with the impugned judgement.",
