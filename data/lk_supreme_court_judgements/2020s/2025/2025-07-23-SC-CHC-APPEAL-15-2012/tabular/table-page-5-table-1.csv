"the petition for winding up of the 1st Defendant Company was dated 20.10.2004, six days"
"prior to the date of the plaint and therefore at the time of filing of the plaint, the Bank was"
"unaware of the petition of winding up of the 1st Defendant Company."
"Further, it was contended that the Rules of winding-up published under the old"
"Companies Ordinance (which are the Rules followed even at present) specifically denotes"
"the timelines the public notifications are published and until then, the public are unaware"
"that  a  winding  up  application  had  been  filed  and  therefore  contended,  that  the  1st"
"Defendant  Company  was  in  existence  when  the  plaint  was  filed.  Further  the  learned"
"Counsel  for  the  Bank  contended,  no  evidence  has  been  led  by  the  2nd  Defendant  to"
"contradict such position and when the time is right, steps will be taken to resurrect the"
"case against the 1st Defendant Company and/or to proceed against the Liquidator if need"
"be, and such course of action will have no effect on the claim against the 2nd Defendant,"
"the Managing Director of the 1st Defendant Company, who signed the Guarantee Bond as"
"a personal guarantee."
"The learned Counsel for the Bank further submitted, that presently the matter in"
"issue is the claim against the Guarantor and Clause 19 of the Guarantee Bond expressly"
"states, that if monies secured by the Guarantee Bond are not recoverable from the principle"
"debtor  due  to  any  reason,  including  the  operation  of  the  law,  that  the  monies  can  be"
"recovered from the Guarantor and such process can be proceeded against the Guarantor"
"in the first instance, and therefore moved that the 1st question of law be answered in favour"
"of the Bank."
"I have considered the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Bank with regard"
"to  maintainability  of  this  application,  in  the  light  of  lodging  an  application  before  the"
"Liquidator. I  have also considered the provisions of the Companies Act  then and now,"
"Rules published under the old Companies Ordinance and I see merit in the submissions"
"of the Bank, that the Plaintiff Bank is entitled to maintain this action, even if the Bank went"
"before the winding up court. In the said circumstances, I answer the 1st question of law in"
"the affirmative."
