"“When a power is entrusted to a very high and responsible officer, he  may be"
"expected to act reasonably, objectively and without bias whilst discharging his"
"duties.”"
"However,  in  the  instant  matter,  I  find  upon  perusal  of  the  documents  submitted"
"that the 1st respondent had not acted reasonably and objectively when considering"
"the  deed  of  gift  and the  Special  Power  of  Attorney  and  the  lease  agreement  of  the"
"petitioner.  He  should  have  had  the  foresight  to  see  that  although  the  lessor  had"
"gifted the property to his son, he has retained the life interest  in the property and"
"even if it is not, he has been given the power of attorney to lease out the property"
"concerned.  Nevertheless,  all  these  activities  had  been  done  subsequent  to  the"
"impugned lease agreement."
"Therefore,  it  is  quite  evident  that  the  1st  respondent  hadn’t  acted  reasonably  and"
"objectively, when considering the application  of the petitioner, as he had failed to"
"give  due  consideration  to  the  deed  of  gift,  the  power  of  attorney,  and  the  lease"
"agreements."
