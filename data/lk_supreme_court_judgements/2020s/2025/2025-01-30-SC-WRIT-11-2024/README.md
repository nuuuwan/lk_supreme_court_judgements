RESPONDENTS

BEFORE : P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

A. L. SHIRAN GOONERATNE, J. &

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

COUNSEL : Ali Sabry, PC, with Namiq Naffath instructed by Sanath

Wijewardane for the Petitioners.

Yuresha de Silva, DSG, for the 1st -6th & 42nd Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 22-10-2024

DECIDED ON : 30-01-2025

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

The 1st 2nd and 3rd Petitioners are all members of the said political party. It is a

recognised political party for the purpose of elections in terms of the Parliamentary

Elections Act No. 01 of 1981 as amended. The Election Commission called for

nominations for the parliamentary election 2024 for which the nomination period was

set as the period from 04th October 2024 to 12 noon on 11th October 2024. The

Petitioners being desirous of handing over the Nomination Papers for the said election

[SC Writ Application No. 11/2024] - Page 11 of 18

11

had decided to submit the Nomination Paper for the candidates contesting from the

said political party from Vanni district.

The 1st Petitioner is the authorized agent of Democratic National Alliance for the

electoral district of Vanni for the purpose of submitting the Nomination Paper on behalf

of the said political party in terms of Section 15 (4) of the Parliamentary Elections Act.

Therefore, he (the 1st Petitioner) came to the District Secretariat office on the 10th

October 2024, accompanied by the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners for the purpose of

submitting the Nomination Paper on behalf of the said party for the Vanni electoral

district.

Upon arrival at the registration/reception desk at the District Secretariat, the 1st

Petitioner handed over the Nomination Paper and supporting documents to the 2nd

Petitioner to hold the same, to enable him (the 1st Petitioner) to fill in the information,

on a sheet at the counter. At the same time, an officer had directed the 1st to 3rd

Petitioners to go towards the table of the 6th Respondent which was about 10 feet

away from the afore-said registration/reception desk to hand over the Nomination

Paper to the 6th Respondent Returning Officer.

While the 1st Petitioner was still filling the information, the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners

proceeded to the table of the 6th Respondent Returning Officer. Upon arrival at that

table, the 6th Respondent signalled the 2nd Petitioner to sit on the sole chair available

in front of him. The 6th Respondent Returning Officer then gestured the 2nd Petitioner

to hand over the Nomination Paper to him. It was at that time, responding to the

signalling/gesture of the 6th Respondent that the 2nd Petitioner had handed over the

Nomination Paper and the supporting documents to the 6th Respondent Returning

Officer. It was then that the 6th Respondent had requested the National Identity Card

of the 2nd Petitioner.

The 1st Petitioner having finished filling the information in front of the help desk by

that time, immediately intervened at the 6th Respondents counter claiming that he is

the authorized agent of the said Democratic National Alliance. The 1st Petitioner at

that time, also claimed that he was the authorised agent to hand over the Nomination

[SC Writ Application No. 11/2024] - Page 12 of 18

12

Paper and the supporting documents on behalf of the said political party. It is to be

noted that the 1st Petitioners name appears 1st in the list of candidates on the

Nomination Paper.

In the afternoon on the same day, the 6th Respondent Returning Officer had informed

the 1st Petitioner that the Nomination Paper was rejected on the basis that it was not

handed over as per Section 15 (4) and (5) of the Parliamentary Elections Act. Let me

reproduce below these two Sections:

Section 15

(4) Such Nomination Paper shall be delivered to the returning officer at

his office during normal office hours within the nomination period by the

secretary of a recognized political party or by the candidate whose name

appears first in such nomination paper (hereinafter referred to as the

"authorised agent") in the case of a recognised political party, or by the

group leader in the case of an independent group.

(5) Where, due to any reason whatsoever, the secretary of a recognised

political party or the authorised agent or the group leader is unable to

deliver a nomination paper, the candidate whose name appears second

on such nomination paper shall deliver such nomination paper to the

returning officer as required by subsection (4).

The Petitioners claiming the rejection to be Ultra vires and/or illegal and/or

unreasonable in the special circumstances of this case, had prayed inter alia for the

following relief in their Petition:

b). A mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of

the 6th Respondent set out in the letter marked "P 3", rejecting the

Nomination Paper on behalf of Democratic National Alliance for the

electoral District of Vanni;

[SC Writ Application No. 11/2024] - Page 13 of 18

13

c). A mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st to 6th

Respondents and/or any one or more of them from proceeding with the

parliamentary elections in the electoral district of Vanni scheduled to be

held on the 14th of November 2024 without accepting and/or receive as

valid the nominations submitted by the Petitioners on behalf of

Democratic National Alliance for the electoral district of Vanni marked as

"P 1" to the Petition;

d). A mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus on the 1st to 6th

Respondents and/or any one or more of them to accept and/or receive

as valid the Nomination Paper marked as "P 1" submitted on behalf of

the Democratic National Alliance for the electoral district of Vanni for the

parliamentary election scheduled to be held on the 14th of November

2024

e). An interim order preventing 1st to 6th Respondents and/or any one or

more of them from holding the parliamentary elections in respect of

election of members to the electoral district of Vanni scheduled to be

held on the 14th of November 2024 until hearing and final determination

of this application.

f). Call for and examine any and all records, including the original

Nomination Paper filed by the Petitioners maintained by the 1st to 6th

Respondent and/or CCTV Footage of the District Secretary dated 10th

October 2024 and/or the book that was placed at the entrance of the

Divisional Secretariat to enter the details of the parties and/or any one

or more of them in respect of the subject matter of this application.

The Petitioners relied on the Judgment of this Court in SC/ WRIT/ Application No. 12/

2018 (SC Minutes 30th August 2019). Learned Deputy Solicitor General, who appeared

for the Respondents, took steps to display the CCTV recording of the whole incident

of handing over the Nomination Paper by the Petitioners at the aforesaid counters at

[SC Writ Application No. 11/2024] - Page 14 of 18

14

the District Secretariat on the relevant date. We carefully watched and observed all

the movements of the Petitioners i.e. how the 1st Petitioner walked into the District

Secretariat office on that day, accompanied by the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners; how the 1st

Petitioner handed over the Nomination Paper and supporting documents to the 2nd

Petitioner to hold upon arrival at the registration/reception desk at the District

Secretariat; how the 1st Petitioner then started writing on a paper (presumably the

information sheet) at the counter; how at the same time, an officer had directed the

1st to 3rd Petitioners to go towards the table of the 6th Respondent which was some

distance away from the afore-said registration/reception desk; how the 2nd and 3rd

Petitioners proceeded to the table of the 6th Respondent Returning Officer; how the

1st Petitioner was still filling the information at the first counter; upon arrival at that

table, how the 6th Respondent signalled the 2nd Petitioner to sit on the sole chair

available in front of him; how 6th Respondent Returning Officer then gestured the 2nd

Petitioner to hand over the Nomination Paper to him; how the 2nd Petitioner

responding to the signalling/gesture of the 6th Respondent handed over the

Nomination Paper to the 6th Respondent Returning Officer; how the 6th Respondent

requested the National Identity card from the 2nd Petitioner; how the 1st Petitioner

after finishing the filling of information in front of the help desk, thereafter immediately

intervened at the counter where the 6th Respondent was seated.

Having taken a closer view of this footage and having studied the Judgement of this

Court in SC/ WRIT/ Application No. 12/ 2018 we take the view that the facts and

circumstances of the instant case are similar to those in SC/ WRIT/ Application No.

12/ 2018.

Although SC/ WRIT/ Application No. 12/ 2018 deals with the rejection of the

Nomination Paper submitted under the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance No. 53

of 1946, the effect of the wordings in the relevant provisions are the same as Sections

15 (4) and (5) of the Parliamentary Elections Act. To make this clear let me reproduce

the relevant provision below:

Section 28(5), Local Authorities Elections Ordinance No. 53 of 1946

[SC Writ Application No. 11/2024] - Page 15 of 18

15

Each nomination paper shall be signed by the secretary of a recognized

political party and in the case of an independent group, by the candidate

whose name appears in the nomination paper of that group and is

designated therein as the group leader of that group (such candidate is

hereinafter referred to as "the group leader") and shall be attested by a

Justice of the Peace or by a Notary Public.

Such nomination paper shall be delivered to the returning officer within

the nomination period by the secretary or the authorized agent, in the

case of a recognized political party, or the group leader in the case of an

independent group.

We have carefully perused the Judgment of this Court in SC/ WRIT/ Application No.

12/ 2018 (SC Minutes 30th August 2019). In that case, there were three Petitioners.

The 1st Petitioner in that case was the duly appointed authorised agent for the election

of members of Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha at the Local Authorities Election 2018. In the

said case, the followings were established before Court from the documents:

i. both the 1st Petitioner and the 2nd Petitioner entered the premises

of the District Secretariat of Galle at 10.55 am on 21st December

2017 and proceeded to its auditorium for the purpose of delivering

the Nomination Paper of the Democratic United National Front to

the 1st Respondent;

ii. the 2nd Petitioner was seated in front on the 1st Respondent's desk;

iii. the 1st Petitioner was seated by the side of the 2nd Petitioner;

iv. the 1st Petitioner and 2nd Petitioner were seated together in front of

the 1st Respondent's desk and that they came there for the specific

purpose of delivering the Nomination Paper of their political party to

the 1st Respondent.

Having considered the facts, circumstances and the background of the case, Prasanna

Jayawardena, J. in SC/ WRIT/ Application No. 12/ 2018 had the following to say:

The fact that the 1st petitioner was, all along, seated by the side of the

2nd petitioner and was, thereby, participating in the act of handing over

[SC Writ Application No. 11/2024] - Page 16 of 18

16

the Nomination Paper to the 1st respondent cannot be ignored. The 1st

petitioner was very much an integral part of the act of "delivering" the

Nomination Paper to the 1st respondent. Too much should not be read

into the fact that it was the 2nd petitioner who physically handed the

Nomination Paper to the 1st respondent since it is clear that the 1st

petitioner was present at that very moment by the side of the 2nd

petitioner and that the 2nd petitioner was acting on behalf of the 1st

petitioner and under the direct control of the 1st petitioner. Further, I

have no doubt that the 2nd petitioner handed the Nomination Paper to

the 1st respondent only because the 1st respondent beckoned him to do

so and that the 1st and 2nd petitioners rushed to obey. I also accept the

petitioners' narration that, thereafter, the 2nd petitioner handed his

National Identity Card to the 1st respondent only because the 1st

respondent insisted that he did so.

In these circumstances, I have no hesitation in holding that there was

compliance with the requirements of section 28 (5) of the Ordinance

which require that the Nomination Paper and supporting documents be

"delivered" to the 1st respondent by the authorised agent of the political

party. In my view, the aforesaid circumstances in which the Nomination

Paper and supporting documents were handed to the 1st respondent

constitute "delivery" of the Nomination Paper by the 1st petitioner, who

was the authorised agent of the political party since the 1st petitioner

was physically present at the time and the Nomination Paper was handed

to the 1st respondent by the 2nd petitioner who was acting under the 1st

petitioner's direct control at that time and on behalf of the 1st petitioner.

As observed earlier, the 1st petitioner was an integral part of the act of

"delivering" the Nomination Paper to the 1st respondent.

We observed that the Petitioners had prayed for an interim order to prevent the 1st to

6th Respondents from holding the Parliamentary Election in respect of the electoral

district of Vanni which was scheduled to be held on the 14th of November 2024 until

[SC Writ Application No. 11/2024] - Page 17 of 18

17

hearing and final determination of this Petition. Therefore, with a view to avoid

inconvenience to all the parties and to facilitate the smooth conduct of the already

scheduled Parliamentary Election, Court after considering all the matters, few days

after the Petitioners first supported this case (i.e. on 22nd October 2024), indicated to

parties its final conclusion in open court pending the pronouncement of its reasons for

the said final conclusion. It was subsequent to the said indication that the learned

Deputy Solicitor General on the following day (i.e., on 23rd October 2024) informed

Court that the Election Commission would take appropriate steps based on the final

conclusion of this Court which was indicated to the parties in open court. Having

considered the factual background of this case, we are of the view that the Petitioners

had duly handed over the Nomination Paper (P 1) to the 6th Respondent Returning

Officer sufficiently complying with the provisions in Section 15 (4) of the Parliamentary

Elections Act No. 01 of 1981 as amended. In the factual circumstances of this case,

we hold that it was unreasonable for the 6th Respondent to have rejected the

Nomination Paper (P 1) on the basis that it was not duly handed over by the candidate

whose name appeared first in the Nomination Paper.

Court on 22-10-2024, had already proceeded to pronounce that the Returning Officer

(the 6th Respondent) was obliged in law to have accepted the Nomination Paper which

the 1st Petitioner was to hand over. On the same day the Court also proceeded to

pronounce that in those circumstances, the Court would issue a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision of the Returning Officer to reject it and issue a Writ of Mandamus

to compel the relevant Respondents to accept the Nomination Paper relevant to this

case.

In the above circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, we decide to issue:

i. a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 6th

Respondent as set out in the letter marked "P 3", rejecting the Nomination

Paper submitted on behalf of Democratic National Alliance for the electoral

District of Vanni;

[SC Writ Application No. 11/2024] - Page 18 of 18

18

ii. Issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus on the 1st to 6th

Respondents and/or any one or more of them to accept and/or receive as valid

the Nomination Paper marked as "P 1" submitted on behalf of the Democratic

National Alliance for the electoral district of Vanni for the parliamentary

election scheduled to be held on the 14th of November 2024

In all the circumstances of this case, we order no costs.
