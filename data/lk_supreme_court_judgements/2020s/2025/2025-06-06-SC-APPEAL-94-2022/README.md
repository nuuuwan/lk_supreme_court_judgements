THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. This is an appeal arising from an Order of the Provincial High Court of the Central Province

holden in Nuwara Eliya (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “High Court”), which

overturned an order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal of Nuwara Eliya

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the “Labour Tribunal”).

2. In order to avoid any confusion arising out of the identification of the parties hereinbelow,

I wish to note at the very outset that this Court took the liberty of correcting the caption

to properly identify the Appellant party, in spite of the Registered Attorney’s failure to

amend the caption after obtaining leave to appeal.

FACTS OF THE MATTER

3. Shelton Anthoney Kahawe, Applicant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the “Applicant-Respondent") had been employed as a Sanitary and Stores Labourer by

the People's Bank, the 2nd Respondent-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

"the Appellant Bank") in Nuwara Eliya since 1993 when the Appellant Bank terminated his

services for misconduct having found him guilty in a disciplinary inquiry.

4. The alleged misconduct had taken place on 8th August 2007, when the Applicant-

Respondent visited the Nuwara Eliya Regional Office under the influence of alcohol after

he was dispatched on an errand to the Sri Lanka Telecom PLC office in Nuwara Eliya by

the Manager of the Ragala Branch on the said date. Having visited the Nuwara Eliya

Regional Office thereafter, in an inebriated state, he had behaved in an unruly manner

within the Bank premises. The Applicant-Respondent had also disrupted and prevented

the employees from carrying out their duties, and the police had subsequently been called

to control the situation.

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 16

5. Following the Applicant-Respondent’s arrest, the police had produced him before the

District Medico-Legal Officer of Nuwara Eliya and the Medico-Legal Examination Form

(MLEF). The record also indicates that he had been charged before the Magistrate’s Court

of Nuwara Eliya for causing annoyance under the influence of liquor in terms of the

Offences Committed under the Influence of Liquor (Special Provisions) Act, No. 41 of 1979,

and that he had pleaded guilty on 01st September 2008. As a result, the learned Magistrate

had imposed a fine of Rs. 2,500/- against the Applicant-Respondent. However, pursuant

to a revision application filed by the Applicant-Respondent, the High Court of Nuwara

Eliya had set aside the fine so imposed by the Magistrate’s Court, ordering the Applicant

to pay Rs. 1,000/- to a charity organisation along with Rs. 1,500/- state costs instead.

6. By letter dated 10th April 2008, Appellant Bank had charged the Applicant-Respondent for

six counts of misconduct relating to the aforementioned incident, informing that a

disciplinary inquiry would be held regarding the same. Having found the Applicant-

Respondent guilty of all but one charge, the Bank had terminated his services by letter

dated 24th December 2008.1

7. Being aggrieved by the said termination, the Applicant-Respondent had preferred an

application to the Labour Tribunal of Nuwara Eliya alleging his termination to be unjust.

By Order dated 25th May 2018, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal had dismissed

the application, finding the termination of his services by the Appellant Bank to be just

and equitable. Aggrieved by this Order of the Labour Tribunal, he had appealed to the

Provincial High Court to set aside the Order of the Labour Tribunal.

8. The High Court, by Order dated 02nd June 2020, in spite of its finding that the Applicant-

Respondent is in fact guilty of the misconduct, had nevertheless set aside the order of the

1 Marked “R26”.

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 16

Labour Tribunal and ordered the reinstatement of the Applicant with three years’ basic

salary as back wages. It is clear from the Order of the High Court that the learned Judge

had considered termination of employment to be a disproportionate punishment for the

Applicant’s misconduct.

9. The Respondent Bank filed the instant appeal before this Court in terms of Section 31DD

of the Industrial Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950, challenging the aforementioned Order of

the High Court.

QUESTIONS OF LAW

10. This Court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law;

I. Has the Provincial High Court erred in law in disturbing the findings of the Labour

Tribunal when the Labour Tribunal order is consistent with the evidence?

II. Whether the Provincial High Court has erred in law in the granting of relief?

III. Whether the Provincial High Court had erred in law in the analysis of the evidence

and reached findings which are perverse?

IV. Has the Provincial High Court rightly held that the President of the Labour Tribunal

has failed to appreciate that the punishment meted out to the Applicant was

excessive and disproportionate to the alleged misconducts?

ANALYSIS

11. Where an application is made before a Labour Tribunal alleging unjust termination and a

respondent-employer admits termination, the burden is on such employer to begin the

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 16

case and establish on a balance of probabilities2 that the termination was justified. This is

based on the principle that ‘he who alters the status quo and not he who demands its

restoration, must explain the reasons for such alteration’.3

12. In a case of this nature, where termination is based on a finding of misconduct, it is

generally incumbent upon the employer to establish two things: firstly, that there is a

misconduct on the part of the employee, and secondly, that the misconduct is sufficiently

grave to warrant termination of services.

13. No precise statutory definition of misconduct is available in our law. While that may be so,

this Court has previously considered how questions of misconduct may be approached.

As to what may amount to misconduct, Priyasath Depp, PC, J (as His Lordship was then)

observed as follows in M.D. Gunasena & Co. Ltd v. Somaratne Gamage:4

“Misconduct is not defined in the Industrial Dispute Act. In the absence of a definition

it is necessary to refer to case law in Sri Lanka and in other jurisdictions. Sri Lankan

and Indian Courts have followed the english case law. As far back as 1886 Pearce Vs.

Foster, laid down the law thus “The test is that the misconduct must be inconsistent

with the fulfillment of the express or implied conditions of service in order to justify

2 See Trico Maritime (Pvt) Ltd. v. Inter Company Trade Union, SC Appeal 66/2018, SC Minutes of 30th March 2022, at 9; Lanka Banku Sevaka Sangamaya (On behalf of L.D. Dayananda) v. People’s Bank, SC Appeal No. 209/2012, SC Minutes of 16th November 2015, at 14; Piyasena Silva v. Ceylon Fisheries Corporation [1994] 2 Sri LR 292; Associated Battery Manufacturers Ceylon Ltd v. United Engineering Workers Union (1975) 77 NLR 541; Sithamparanathan v. People’s Bank (1986) 1 Sri LR 411.

3 S.R. De Silva, The Legal Framework of Industrial Relations in Ceylon (HW Cave & Co. 1973) at 570-571. The principle is cited with approval in many judgments of this Court. See Union Apparel (Pvt) Ltd. v. Dehiwattage Rukman Dinesh Fernando, SC Appeal 19/2015, SC Minutes of 28th October 2021, at 15; John Keells Holdings PLC and 2 Others v. M Ganeshmoorthy, SC Appeal No. 187/2017, SC Minutes of 20th January 2020, at 11; Thevarayan v Balakrishnan (1984) 1 Sri LR 189, at 194

4 [2013] 1 SRI L.R. 143, at 151-152

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 16

dismissal”. This was followed in Shalimar Rope Works Mazdoor Union vs. Shalimar

Rope Works Ltd., a case very often cited in our courts.

A slightly different test was laid down in Laws v. London Chronical Ltd. In that case

it was held that “the misconduct must be inconsistent with the fulfillment of the

express or implied conditions of service or such as to show that the servant had

disregarded the essential conditions of service of the contract of service.”

The implied conditions of service includes conduct such as obedience, honesty,

diligence, good behavior, punctuality, due care. Therefore following acts such as

disobedience, insubordination, dishonesty, negligence, absenteeism and late

attendance, assault are treated as acts of misconduct which are inconsistent with the

implied conditions of service.”5

14. Being disorderly under the influence of alcohol or drugs during working hours, especially

whilst being deployed for a specific purpose, is most certainly sufficient to justify the

termination of an employee’s services. Needless to say, the actions such as intoxication,

disruption and insubordination clearly violate the implied conditions of any form of

employment. In the sectors such as banking, the aforementioned implied conditions of

service carry even greater weight.

15. As this Court emphasised in Bank of Ceylon v. Manivasagasivam,6 financial institutions

operate on public trust, and employees must maintain standards of behaviour that

preserve institutional integrity. The Applicant-Respondent's alleged actions—public

5 Emphasis and citations omitted

6 [1995] 2 Sri L.R. 79.

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 16

intoxication combined with violent and disruptive behaviour in the workplace—stand in

stark contrast to these standards.

16. In General Manager, Ceylon Electricity Board v. Gunapala,7 an employee who was

found to have consumed liquor whilst on duty was dismissed by the employer, although

other employees who were found to have also consumed liquor were not similarly

dismissed. The Court of Appeal found the termination of the employment to be justified

in spite of the fact that others were treated differently.

17. The impropriety of consuming alcohol and drugs in the workplace, especially during work

hours, needs not be explained to a reasonable mind. The resultant impairment of

judgement, focus, productivity and capacity poses operational difficulties or even serious

safety risks in the worst of cases. It wastes both company time as well as the time of

colleagues, clients or customers. Whatever the role of employment may be, drunkenness

undermines professionalism, harms both personal and organisational reputations and

indicates a serious lack of respect towards authority and workplace regulations. It can

affect the team dynamic and the workplace atmosphere by creating discomfort or

resentment among peers, as it clearly has in the instant case, thereby eroding workplace

standards. As such, drunkenness at the workplace is a serious misconduct.

18. This Court found in the case of Lanka Synthetic Fibre Co. Ltd. v. Perera,8 insubordination

and abusive behaviour towards superiors strike at the very foundation of the employment

relationship.

7 [1991] 1 Sri LR 304.

8 [1998] 3 Sri LR 198.

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 16

19. Clearly, the misconduct alleged to have been committed by the Applicant-Respondent is

of such severity that, if properly established, termination of services on that basis would

most certainly be justified.

20. The question is, then, whether the allegation against the Applicant-Respondent is

established on a balance of probabilities by the evidence led before the Labour Tribunal.

Both the learned High Court Judge as well as the President of the Labour Tribunal have

taken into account the Applicant-Respondent’s guilty plea before the Magistrate’s Court

of Nuwara Eliya.

21. In my view, this in itself is sufficient to establish the allegations against the Applicant-

Respondent. However, in addition to this, the Appellant Bank has led evidence from over

a dozen witnesses, and all such witnesses corroborate the finding against the Applicant-

Respondent. Moreover, it is clear that the Appellant Bank conducted a due disciplinary

inquiry before terminating his employment. This indicates the bona fides on the part of

the Respondent Bank.9

22. Accordingly, it is amply clear on the face of the record that alleged misconduct has been

established against the Applicant-Respondent on a balance of probability. Additionally,

as I discussed earlier, the said misconduct is of such a nature and severity that termination

on that basis is most certainly warranted.

23. Although I have already discussed all that needs to be established to dispense with an

application of this nature, I wish to consider some aspects of the High Court Order in

better detail before I proceed to answer the questions of law before us, considering the

wide discretion afforded to courts and tribunals in the adjudication of labour disputes

9 See Thavarayan v. Balakrishnan (1984) 1 Sri LR 189, at 193-194

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 16

under the Industrial Disputes Act. However, it should be borne in mind that while such

discretion is available in granting relief, appellate courts must exercise self-restraint with

respect to factual findings of a labour tribunal and only interfere with such findings in the

most exceptional of circumstances where it can be said that the tribunal has arrived at

perverse conclusions that are not warranted by evidence before it.

24. As Senanayake, J. for the Court of Appeal observed in the case of Ceylon Cinema and

Film Studio Employees Union v. Liberty Cinema Ltd.:10

“…Upon an appeal from a judgement where both facts and law are open to appeal,

the Appeal Court is bound to pronounce such judgements as its view ought to have

been pronounced by the Court from which the appeal proceeds. In the exercise of its

jurisdiction, the Appellate Court may not be disposed to come to a different

conclusion on questions of fact unless it is satisfied that any advantage enjoyed by

the trial Judge by reason of having seen and heard the witness could not be sufficient

to explain or justify the trial judge’s conclusion. On the other hand the scope of the

powers of an Appellate Court where a right of appeal to the court lies only a questions

of law, is more restricted. It is bound by the findings of fact unless the conclusion of

fact drawn by the Tribunal is not supported by any legal evidence or is not rationally

possible…”

25. Sharvananda, J. (as His Lordship was then) observed in Caledonian Estates Ltd. v.

Hillman,11

“Under section 31.D(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, an appeal to the Supreme Court

10 [1994] 3 Sri LR 121 at 124, citing Wimalaratne, J. in Weerawardene v. The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. S.C. Appeal No. 16/83, SC Minutes of 12th June 1984

11 79 (1) NLR 421, at 425

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 16

lies from an order of a Labour Tribunal only on a question of law. Parties are bound

by the Tribunal’s findings of fact, unless it could be said that the said findings are

perverse and not supported by any evidence. With regard to cases where an appeal

is provided on questions of law only, Lord Normand, in Inland Revenue v. Fraser,

(1942) 24 Tax Cases p. 498, spelt the powers of the Court as follows:

“In cases where it is competent for a Tribunal to make findings of fact

which are excluded from review, the Appeal Court has always jurisdiction to

intervene if it appears… that the Tribunal has made a finding for which there

is no evidence, or which is inconsistent with the evidence and contradictory of

it.”

“In this framework, the question of assessment of evidence is within the province of

the Tribunal, and, if there is evidence on record to support its findings, this Court

cannot review those findings even though on its own perception of the evidence this

Court may be inclined to come to a different conclusion…”

26. Although the provisions in the Industrial Disputes Act relating the appeals have been

subsequently amended, decisions mentioned above remain relevant to date.

27. Section 31D(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act (as Amended) provides as follows:

“Where the workman who, or the trade union which, makes an application to a

labour tribunal, or the employer to whom that application relates is dissatisfied with

the order of the tribunal on that application, such workman, trade union or employer

may, by written petition in which the other party is mentioned as the respondent,

appeal from that order on a question of law, to the High Court established under

Article 154P of the Constitution, for the province within which such labour tribunal

is situated.”

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 16

28. As the aforementioned provision makes it amply clear, an appeal to the High Court from

an order of a Labour Tribunal can only be made on a question of law. In line with the

authorities cited above, an appellate court must not lightly disturb the factual finding of

a Labour Tribunal.12 The Labour Tribunal not only has the opportunity to hear the

testimonies and observe the mannerisms of witnesses, but it also has the opportunity to

perform certain inquisitorial functions, and is therefore uniquely positioned to find and

consider the factual circumstances surrounding a dispute.

29. However, much of the analysis in the High Court Order relates to the factual circumstances

of the matter at hand. The learned High Court Judge has adverted to shortcomings on

the part of the police officers who arrested the Applicant-Respondent on several instances

in the Order. The learned Judge comments more than once that the police officers had

allowed the Applicant-Respondent to commit an offence under the Influence of Liquor

Act, without attempting to de-escalate the situation.13

30. On page 6 of the Order, the learned Judge categorically states that “…the arrest of the

Appellant by the police in front of the Regional Office Nuwaraeliya of People’s Bank for

indecent behaviour under influence of liquor seems to be a planned act after allowing the

12 See also Shanthi Sagara Gunawardena v. Ranjith Kumudusena Gunawardena and Others, SC Appeal 89/2016, SC Minutes of 02nd April 2019, at 4; Kotagala Plantations Ltd., and Another v. Ceylon Planters Society [2010] 2 Sri LR 299, at 304; Jayasuriya v. Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation [1995] 2 Sri LR 379

13 See Shanthi Sagara Gunawardena v. Ranjith Kumudusena Gunawardena and Others, SC Appeal 89/2016, SC Minutes of 02nd April 2019, at 7-8, citing Air Port and Aviation (SL) Ltd v. K.D.H. Sunil SC Appeal 147/94, SC Minutes of 23rd March 1995

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 16

Appellant to commit an offence punishable under Act No. 04 of 1979 [sic], with some

devious scheming in mind.”14

31. Moreover, the Order of the High Court further alludes to some form of collusion between

the police and the Appellant Bank as well as mala fides on the part of the Bank with respect

to the disciplinary inquiry. Although such indications are repeatedly made throughout the

High Court Order, I am unable to find any reference whatsoever to evidence justifying

such conclusions. In this context, the conclusions of the learned Judge can only be

described as conjectural.

32. In addition to this, the Order of the High Court also finds fault with the Labour Tribunal

for its failure to consider the reasons for the Applicant-Respondent’s behaviour. On page

8 of the Order, the learned Judge states as follows: “…the Learned President of the Labour

Tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that there should be some reason for the Appellant to

behave in that way. According to the Appellant, he got annoyed over the refusal to issue

stationery, but the Learned President of the Labour Tribunal had totally disregarded it.”

Having so reasoned, the learned Judge has come to the conclusion that the Applicant had

been victimised owing to the disproportionate treatment.

33. In my view, the aforementioned findings of the learned Judge are not only highly

conjectural but also generally irrelevant to the crux of the dispute.

34. Having considered the evidence before the Labour Tribunal, the learned President had

found the Applicant guilty of misconduct. It is clear on the face of the record that this

finding is supported by the testimonies of several witnesses. The misconduct so

14 The reference to the statute must be corrected as Offences Committed under the Influence of Liquor (Special Provisions) Act, No. 41 of 1979

SC Appeal 94/2022 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 16

established, as I have already considered, is serious enough to justify termination of his

employment. Considering this, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has

erred in setting aside the Order of the Labour Tribunal and in ordering reinstatement of

the Applicant-Respondent.

35. I am reminded of the shrewd cautious remarks of former Chief Justice H.N.G. Fernando,

albeit in a somewhat different context: the Industrial Disputes Act does not confer on an

arbitrator the freedom of a wild horse, and an arbitrator holds no license to make any

award as he may please, for nothing is just and equitable which is decided by whim or

caprice.15 Although His Lordship said so specifically of the ‘just and equitable’ discretion

of arbitrators under the Industrial Disputes Act, it might just as well have said arbiter in

place of arbitrator, for the Act affords unbridled discretion to no judicial body.

36. Any and all findings of a court or tribunal must be derived from careful and logical

deduction of the evidence placed before it—things may be inferred, but never assumed.

Orders and directions that follow must necessarily be just and fair for all parties involved,

not only the employee, as is often presumed erroneously in industrial adjudication. This

Court has emphasised this time and time again.16

37. Accordingly, I answer the first, second and third questions of law in the affirmative and

the final question of law in the negative.
