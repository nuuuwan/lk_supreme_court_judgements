"19.  Clearly, the misconduct alleged to have been committed by the Applicant-Respondent is",""
"","of such severity that, if properly established, termination of services on that basis would"
"","most certainly be justified."
"20.  The  question","is, 
then,  whether 
the  allegation  against 
the  Applicant-Respondent 
is"
"","established on a balance of probabilities by the evidence led before the Labour Tribunal."
"","Both the learned High Court Judge as well as the President of the Labour Tribunal have"
"","taken into account the Applicant-Respondent’s guilty plea before the Magistrate’s Court"
"","of Nuwara Eliya."
"21.","In  my  view,  this  in itself  is  sufficient  to  establish  the  allegations  against  the  Applicant-"
"","Respondent. However, in addition to this, the Appellant Bank has led evidence from over"
"","a dozen witnesses, and all such witnesses corroborate the finding against the Applicant-"
"","Respondent.  Moreover, it is clear that  the  Appellant  Bank  conducted  a due disciplinary"
"","inquiry before terminating his  employment. This indicates the  bona fides  on the part of"
"","the Respondent Bank.9"
"22.  Accordingly, it is amply clear on the face of the record that alleged misconduct has been",""
"","established  against the Applicant-Respondent  on  a  balance of probability. Additionally,"
"","as I discussed earlier, the said misconduct is of such a nature and severity that termination"
"","on that basis is most certainly warranted."
"23.  Although  I have already discussed  all that  needs to  be established  to dispense with an",""
"","application  of  this  nature,  I  wish  to  consider  some  aspects  of  the  High  Court  Order  in"
"","better detail before I proceed to answer the questions of law before us, considering the"
"","wide  discretion  afforded  to  courts  and  tribunals  in  the  adjudication  of  labour  disputes"
