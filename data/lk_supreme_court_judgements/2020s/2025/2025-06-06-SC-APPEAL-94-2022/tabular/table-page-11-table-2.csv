"24.  As Senanayake, J. for the  Court  of Appeal  observed  in the case of  Ceylon Cinema and"
"Film Studio Employees Union v. Liberty Cinema Ltd.:10"
"“…Upon an appeal from a judgement where both facts and law are open to appeal,"
"the Appeal Court is bound to pronounce such judgements as its view ought to have"
"been pronounced by the Court from which the appeal proceeds. In the exercise of its"
"jurisdiction,  the  Appellate  Court  may  not  be  disposed  to  come  to  a  different"
"conclusion on questions of fact unless it is satisfied that any advantage enjoyed by"
"the trial Judge by reason of having seen and heard the witness could not be sufficient"
"to explain or justify the trial judge’s conclusion. On the other hand the scope of the"
"powers of an Appellate Court where a right of appeal to the court lies only a questions"
"of law, is more restricted. It is bound by the findings of fact unless the conclusion of"
"fact drawn by the Tribunal is not supported by any legal evidence or is not rationally"
"possible…”"
