"28.  As the aforementioned provision makes it amply clear, an appeal to the High Court from"
"an order of  a Labour Tribunal can only be made on a question of law.  In line with the"
"authorities cited above, an appellate court must not lightly disturb the factual finding of"
"a  Labour  Tribunal.12  The  Labour  Tribunal  not  only  has  the  opportunity  to  hear  the"
"testimonies and observe the mannerisms of witnesses, but it also has the opportunity to"
"perform  certain inquisitorial functions, and is therefore uniquely  positioned  to find and"
"consider the factual circumstances surrounding a dispute."
