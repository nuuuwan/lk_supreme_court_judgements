ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This appeal arises from an action instituted by the Plaintiff, seeking a

declaration of his title to the land under dispute and ejectment of the Defendant

therefrom. The Defendant claimed in his Answer that the disputed land is owned

and cultivated by him, on a permit bearing No. AP/20/ES/917/76.

After trial, the District Court of Akkaraipattu, dismissed the Plaintiffs

action by its judgment dated 21.01.2008. The High Court of Civil Appeal allowed

the appeal preferred by the Plaintiff against that judgment and granted relief as

prayed for in the Plaint. The Defendant thereafter sought leave to appeal from

this Court against the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal.

This Court, after hearing Counsel, granted Leave to Appeal on the

following questions of law, on 09.09.2014;

1. Was the High Court of Civil Appeal, Kalmunai, in error in

proceeding on the basis that the Plaintiff had title to the land

ignoring the conclusions reached by the learned District Judge set

out in para 21(i) to (iv) of this Petition? Yes, As a permit holder

cannot get a declaration of title to the State land.

2. Did the High Court of Civil Appeal, Kalmunai, err in law in

granting the relief prayed for by the Plaintiff notwithstanding the

fanciful nature of his claim to title borne out by the observations

made by the learned District Judge set out in para 21 (viii) to (xiv)

of this Petition? Same answer as (1). However, the Plaintiff is

entitled to get an order of eviction against the Defendant.

S.C. Appeal No. 157/2014

3. Was the High Court of Civil Appeal, Kalmunai, in error in

ordering the ejectment of the Defendant who had been in

possession of the land for more than 47 years without giving any

weight to the conclusions made by the learned District Judge set

out in para 21 (xv) to (xviii) of this Petition? No.

In instituting action before the District Court, the Plaintiff claimed that he

has the title to the parcel of land described in the schedule to the Plaint, upon a

permit issued under Land Development Ordinance bearing No. AP/20/ES/45,

and the Defendant had forcibly occupied the said land in May 2000.

The Defendant, averred in his Answer that he is in possession of a land,

the boundaries of which he described in its schedule upon receiving approval

to enjoy the crown land, under permit No. AP/20/ES/917/76. He alleged that

the permit No. AP/20/ES/45, relied on by the Plaintiff to prove his title is a one

fraudulently prepared.

The parties have settled for a total of 12 issues among them. The Plaintiff

raised his issues in line with the position he had taken up in his Plaint. The

Plaintiff and the Defendant have raised six issues each.

In view of the questions of law on which the instant appeal was argued on

by Counsel, issue Nos. 7 and 11 assume a greater significance. The issue No. 7

was framed to the effect whether the Defendant possessed the land, described in

the Schedule to the Answer, on permit No. AP/20/ES/917/76, whereas the issue

No. 11, was whether the Plaintiff fabricated documents in respect of the land

described in the Schedule to the answer by means of undue influence ?.

S.C. Appeal No. 157/2014

It is apparent, even from a cursory examination of the pleadings and the

issues raised before the trial Court in this vindicatory action, the description of

the parcel of land under dispute in the Schedule to the Plaint does not match to

the description of the land, provided by the Defendant, in the Schedule to his

Answer. It is trite law that, in a rei vindicatio action, it was for the Plaintiff to

establish the identity of the land to which he claims title, and that the Defendant

is in its possession.

The evidence of the Plaintiff is that he cultivated the paddy land under

dispute, on the strength of the permit issued under Land Development

Ordinance, since his fathers demise in 1975, up to the point the Defendant had

forcibly came to occupy it in the year 2000. A true copy of the permit No.

AP/20/ES/45 was tendered to Court, marked P2.

The boundaries of the land claimed by the Plaintiff are as follows:

North : Tank Bund East : Path South : Street & Canal West : Anicut and Canal. During the hearing of this appeal, learned Presidents Counsel for the

Defendant contended the fact that the identity of the corpus had not been

established by the Plaintiff had escaped the attention of the High Court of Civil

Appeal in allowing the appeal. Learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff

replied that the identity of the corpus was established to the required degree of

S.C. Appeal No. 157/2014

proof by the evidence presented through the Land Officer and the Agrarian

Officer.

The Plaintiff, during his evidence, stated that the land under dispute is a

agricultural land of 1 acres. He cultivated paddy in that land since 1975. He

further said that the Defendant, after coming into occupation, had dug out the

paddy land to make ponds to cultivate freshwater fish and he had lodged a

complaint with the Agrarian Officer.

The Land Officer and the Agrarian Officer, stated that they both have

personal knowledge of the land in dispute, as they regularly make visits to that

land. The Land Officer stated that the land is reserved for paddy cultivation and

the permit was issued to the Plaintiff for that purpose. The Officer added that,

presently the land is used for fish culture. The Land Officer too confirmed that

the land under dispute is a paddy land, registered under the Agrarian

Development Act as such. This witness too stated that the Defendant made fish

ponds on that land and is currently engaged in fish culture, without obtaining

prior permission of the Agrarian Commissioner to do so, which is a punishable

offence under the said Act.

During cross examination, the Defendant relied on a permit D1 issued to a

person S.L.M. Hasim by the Government Agent of Ampara on 12.09.86, which

had given the boundaries to the land it relates to as follows:

North : Tank Bund East : M.I. Rafi South : Canal West : Canal

S.C. Appeal No. 157/2014

7

With regard to the contention that the identity of the corpus was not

established by the Plaintiff, the evidence referred to above clearly demonstrate

that there is clear evidence as to the physical identify of land over which the

parties dispute for title. That is a parcel of land now under occupation by the

Defendant, who dug out fish ponds. It is for the Plaintiff to establish that he has

title to that parcel of land now identified by evidence, as the disputed land.

The Schedule to the Plaint describes the land in respect of which the action

is instituted. The boundaries given to a land of 1 acres, in the said Schedule are

as follows:

North : Bund of the Tank East : Path South : Path & Canal West : Bund and Canal.

The Schedule to the Answer describes the land in respect of which the

Defendant is claiming title. The boundaries given to a land of 2 acres, in the said

Schedule are as follows:

North : Bund of a Tank East : M.I. Rafi South : Canal West : Canal

During cross-examination of the Land Officer by the Defendant ( he was

also called as a witness for the Defendant), he was shown the permit relied on by

him and questioned whether the land described in the permit of the Plaintiff and

the land described in the permit of the Defendant is one and the same. The

S.C. Appeal No. 157/2014

8

witness replied that he cannot say whether both are same or not. However, the

witness admitted that the boundaries referred to in the permit issued to the

Plaintiff are similar to the ones the Plaintiff had described. The boundaries so

admitted by the Land Officer, as given in the permit No. AP/20 ES/45 matches

with the one given in the Schedule to the Plaint.

The total extent of the lands described in the Schedules to the Plaint and

the Answer are significantly different. The land claimed by the Plaintiff is a one

of 1 acres whereas the land claimed by the Defendant is of 2 acres. The Eastern

boundaries as well as the Western boundaries are also show significant

differences, which could not be ignored as trivial discrepancies occurred in

describing them.

In consideration of the evidence presented before the trial Court, it is clear

that the Plaintiff had established the boundaries of the land, to which he clams

title under the permit No. AP/20 ES/45. But, the Defendants attempt to present

the land described in the permit No. AP/20/ES/917/76 matches with the

description of the land claimed by the Plaintiff had demonstrably failed. Thus, it

is reasonable to conclude that the land referred to in permit No.

AP/20/ES/917/76 is some other land and not the land described in the Schedule

to the Plaint and the permit No. AP/20/ES/917/76, to which both parties claim

title. Hence, issue No. 7, which was framed to the effect whether the Defendant

possessed the land, described in the Schedule to the Answer, on permit No.

AP/20/ES/917/76, should be answered as either Not proved or irrelevant to

these proceedings as even if he established it is so, that finding will not make him

entitled to the land under dispute. The answer to the said issue given in the

affirmative, by the District Court is clearly a conclusion arrived erroneously.

S.C. Appeal No. 157/2014

9

Accordingly, the said answer to issue No. 7, is reversed by this Court to read as

an answer that reads as - irrelevant to these proceedings.

The case, presented by the Defendant before the trial Court, if condensed

to present in summary form, is that he acquired title to the land in dispute upon

the permit No. AP/20/ES/917/76 and the permit No. AP/20 ES/45, relied on by

the Plaintiff for the same purpose is obtained after using illegal influence.

Having dealt with the first part of his case, this Court now turn to consider the

remaining part, namely issue No. 7 which was framed to the effect whether the

Plaintiff had fabricated documents in respect of the land described in the Schedule to

the answer by means of undue influence ?.

The Defendant placed heavy reliance on certain findings and observations

made by the learned District Judge in support of his contention that the permit of

the Plaintiff is obtained through fraud.

Perusal of the judgment of the trial Court, it appears that the said Court

had taken certain factors as sufficient evidence to establish the disputed

question of fact, presented in the form of an issue No. 7. The trial Court, having

noted that the permit P2 was tendered to Court through witness but the Plaintiff

had filed some other document marked as P1 along with his Plaint. The trial

Court then considered the evidence of the Plaintiff that P1 was issued to him in

1992 and since the original was lost a photo copy of the permit was filed as P1.

Thereafter, he made an application to the Divisional Secretary and was issued

with a permit under Land Development Ordinance, which he tendered to Court

as P2. The trial Court suspects this claim, due to the fact that the Plaint was filed

on 21.07.2003 whereas the seal of the Court, that appeared on P2 indicate it was

tendered to Court on 23.07.2003 and no original was marked through the Land

S.C. Appeal No. 157/2014

10

Officer, except to R3, when that officer was called by the Defendant. It also

considered the fact that the Plaintiff had no permit to present before the Agrarian

Officers who inquired into his allegation of digging out the paddy land.

The other factor that made the trial Court to conclude that permit No.

AP/20 ES/45 obtained by means of undue influence was that when the Plaintiff

claimed that he had been cultivating the disputed paddy land since 1975, after

his fathers demise, he was only 8 years old.

It must be noted that any of these factors have no relevance to the dispute

presented before the trial Court. The issue No. 11, whether the Plaintiff fabricated

documents in respect of the land described in the Schedule to the answer by means of

undue influence ? refers to a land described in the Schedule to the answer and not

the Schedule to the Plaint.

The trial Court approached the issue No. 11 on the basis that the Plaintiff

fabricated documents in respect of the land described in the Schedule to the

Plaint by means of undue influence. The reasoning adopted by that Court

confirms this view. But the issue refers to the land described in the Answer and

not the Plaint. Clearly the schedule of the fabricated permit No. AP/20 ES/45

makes no reference to any of the boundaries, as described in the Schedule to the

Answer of the Defendant. Thus, the said issue should have been answered as a

clear No.

S.C. Appeal No. 157/2014

11

Despite the said conclusion, it must be noted that the factual analysis

undertaken by the trial Court too is clearly erroneous for it had failed to consider

the evidence presented before it in the totality.

The Land Officer, during his evidence of the Plaintiffs case, clearly

stated that the land permit No. AP/20 ES/45 was issued by the Government

Agent of Ampara on 22.05.1992 in the name of the Plaintiff. When the same Land

Officer was called by the Defendant, during his case, who admitted the permits

relied on by the Plaintiff and the Defendant are different and relates to different

lands. Importantly, during the examination in chief by the Defendant, the

witness, in answering the question put to him according to your ledger was the

permit for the crown land issued before issuing the permit under the Land Development

Ordinance to Seinudeen? answered Issued, the number was AP/20 ES/45.

Seinudeen is the Plaintiff, who instituted the instant action .

This was the uncontradicted evidence presented before trial Court on the

issuance of the permit No. AP/20 ES/45. The trial Court, in its consideration of

the evidence, failed to observe the fact that, in cross examination of the Land

Officer by the Defendant, during Plaintiffs case or during the examination in

chief, during the Defendants own case, it was never put to the witness or elicited

from him that the permit No. AP/20 ES/45 was issued upon fabricated

documents and by means of undue influence . Thus, the issue No. 11 should have

been answered by the trial Court as Not proved, instead of answering Yes.

Therefore, the answer to the issue No. 11, is corrected by this Court to read as

Not proved.

S.C. Appeal No. 157/2014

12

The issue Nos 1 to 6 that are answered in the negative and the issue No. 12

answered in the affirmative by the trial Court are therefore amended to read as

follows;

Issue No. 1 Yes, subject to the conditions stipulated under the permit.

Issue No. 2 Yes.

Issue No. 3 Yes.

Issue No. 4 Not proved.

Issue No. 5 Not proved.

Issue No. 6 Ye, Plaintiff is only entitled to get an order of eviction against

the Defendant.

Issue No. 7 Does not arise as irrelevant to these proceedings

Issue No. 8 Does not arise as irrelevant to these proceedings

Issue No. 9 No

Issue No. 10 No

Issue No. 11 Not proved

Issue No. 12 No

The judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 29.07.2011, by

which it set aside the judgment of the District Court, is hereby affirmed, but

subject to the variation that the Plaintiff is not entitled to get a declaration of title

to the land but is entitled to eject the Defendant from.

The District Court is directed to enter decree accordingly.

Subject to the above variation, the appeal of the Defendant is dismissed, in

view of the answers to the three questions of law.
