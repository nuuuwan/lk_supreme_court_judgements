A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

Factual Background

By Plaint dated 12/3/2017, the Plaintiff–Appellant-Appellant instituted Case No.

9778/L in the District Court of Horana against the Defendant–Respondent-

Respondent, seeking, inter alia, a declaration of title to the land described in the

schedule to the Plaint, ejectment of the Defendant from the said land, and

damages.

In paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of the Plaint, the Plaintiff avers that by Deed of Transfer

No. 3354 dated 17/71961, her mother, P. Amarawathi Gunerasekara, became the

lawful owner of Lot D, an extent of 0A 0R 12.13P, as depicted in Plan No. 216 dated

12/08/1950, prepared by J. S. Rodrigo, Licensed Surveyor. The Plaintiff further

states that by Deed of Gift No. 3467 dated 05/09/2003, the said P. Amarawathi

Gunerasekara became the lawful owner of Lot C, containing an extent of 0A 0R

39P, depicted in Plan No. 65 dated 30/7/1919, prepared by Lucus de Mel, Licensed

Surveyor, comprising a house of approximately 55 square feet, both being portions

of the larger land known as Udawatta.

The Plaintiff further avers that by Deed of deed of partition no.3909, her mother

also became the lawful owner of Lot C2, an extent of 0A 0R 6P, depicted in Plan

No. 4067 dated 18/02/2006, prepared by B. A. P. Jayasooriya, Licensed Surveyor,

being a portion of the larger land known as Kahatagahawatta, more fully

described in the Schedule to the Plaint.

In paragraph 6 of the Plaint, the Plaintiff claims that the lands described in

paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 were subsequently amalgamated and subdivided into four

lots, as depicted in Plan No. 4069 prepared by B.A.P. Jayasuriya, Liensed Surveyor,

wherein Lot 2 depicts the land and premises presently in dispute.

Page 6 of 11

The Plaintiff further states that on 9/11/2007, by Deed of Gift No. 4016, marked

P4, the said P. Amarawathi Gunerasekara gifted to her Lot 2, an extent of 0A 0R

24P, depicted in Plan No. 4069 prepared by B.A.P. Jayasuriya, and was

permanently residing in the adjoining house. The Plaintiff alleges that the

Defendant is presently in forcible and unlawful occupation of the said land and

premises.

The Defendant, by Answer dated 09/02/2018, claimed that before the demise of

her mother, P. Amarawathi Gunerasekara, and thereafter, continued to be in

possession of the said premises, that she is completely unaware of the said Deed of

Gift No. 4016. The Defendant prayed for a dismissal of the Plaint.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge by Judgment dated

12/11/2021, decided in favour of the Plaintiff, however, rejected the claim for

damages.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment, the Plaintiff and the Defendant filed two

separate actions in the Civil Appeal High Court of the Western Province holden in

Kalutara, (“the Appellate Court”), challenging the Judgment dated 12/11/2021,

delivered by the District Court of Horana.

After hearing and considering the submissions of both parties, the Appellate Court,

by two separate Judgments delivered on 29/04/2024, allowed the appeal filed by

the Defendant-Appellant and dismissed the claim for damages in the appeal filed

by the Plaintiff-Appellant. Being aggrieved by the two separate Judgments

delivered by the Appellate Court dated 29/04/2024, the Plaintiff, as Plaintiff–

Respondent–Petitioner and as Plaintiff–Appellant–Petitioner (hereinafter

sometimes known as the Plaintiff-Appellant), filed two separate applications

bearing SC/Appeal/No.192/2025 and SC/Appeal/No. 191/2025, respectively,

before this Court.

When the two actions, SC/Appeal/No. 192/2025 and SC/Appeal/No. 191/2025,

were taken up for argument on 23/09/2025, the respective parties agreed that a

single Judgment be delivered in both matters. On a consideration of submissions

Page 7 of 11

made by both parties, the Court decided to grant leave to appeal on the following

questions of law.

Did the Civil Appeal High Court err in law by holding that the deed “P7” has

not been proved?

Did the Civil Appellate High Court fail to observe that the Plaintiff is entitled

for damages as prayed for in the Plaint?

Analysis

The Plaintiff, in her testimony before the trial court, produced Deed of Gift No.

4016, the deed by which the mother of the plaintiff has gifted the subject matter of

this action, marked subject to proof as P7. The document was marked subject to

proof by the Defendant at the time of its production.

The law relating to the proof of documents has been laid down in the Civil

Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2022. Section 2 of this Act introduces

section 154A to be immediately inserted after section 154 of the principal

enactment, which provides that when a deed or any document required by law to

be attested is tendered in evidence, it shall be admissible without requiring formal

proof, unless its execution or genuineness is impeached in the pleadings and raised

as an issue, or the court otherwise requires proof.

The transitional provision of the amendment act provides an exception to the

general rule in Section 154A as follows.

“3. Notwithstanding anything contained in section 2 of this Act, and the

provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, in any case or appeal pending on the

date of coming into operation of this Act –

a. (i) if the opposing party does not object or has not objected to it being

received as evidence on the deed or document being tendered in

evidence;

Page 8 of 11

or

(ii) if the opposing party has objected to it being received as evidence on

the deed or document being tendered in evidence but not objected at the

close of a case when such document is read in evidence,

the court shall admit such deed or document as evidence without

requiring further proof;” (emphasis added)

Upon examination of the record, I observe that while the document marked P7 was

objected to at the time it was tendered, no objection was raised at the stage of

closing the Plaintiff’s case. Furthermore, on the date when the Plaintiff closed her

case (vide page 149 of the appeal brief), as well as on the subsequent date when

proceedings were amended (vide page 151 of the appeal brief), at no stage prior to

the commencement of the Defendant’s case, the documents in question were read

in evidence.

In practice, it was customary for the documents that had been marked during the

trial to be formally “read in evidence” at the close of a party’s case. This was to

confirm that such documents were to be treated as part of the record. However,

this was not a statutory requirement of the Civil Procedure Code, it was a matter of

cursus curiae.

In Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another v. Jugolinija – Boal East [1981] 1

SLR 18, Samarakoon C.J. observed as follows:

“If no objection is taken, when at the close of a case documents are read in

evidence, they are evidence for all purposes of the law. This is the cursus curiae of

the original civil courts.”

The facts of this case do not fall within the literal wording of Section 3(a)(ii) of the

Amendment Act because the document in question was not “read in evidence” at

the close of the case.

Transitional provisions are enacted to aid the courts to move from one statutory

regime to another. As discussed in ‘Understanding Common Law Legislation’

(2001) by F.A.R. Bennion

“Where an Act contains substantive, amending or repealing enactments, it should

also include transitional provisions which regulate the coming into operation of

those enactments and where necessary modify their effect during the period of

transition. If the drafter has forgotten to include such provisions expressly, the

court is required to draw such inferences as to the transitional arrangements as,

in the light of the applicable interpretative criteria, it considers that Parliament

should be taken to have intended.”

The Amendment Act of 2022 created a shift in the procedural law relating to the

proof of attested documents. The Legislature has departed from the previous

evidentiary standard of requiring formal proof in every instance, to presuming the

authenticity unless the execution or genuineness of the document is specifically

challenged in the pleadings.

As held in Thennakoon Mudiyanselage Kusalanthi vs. Liyanage Don

Dharmasena and Others [SC Appeal No. 53/2014, decided on 07.11.2022]

“It is observable that this amendment to the Civil Procedure Code, has directly

impacted upon the principles of law which are contained in the earlier mentioned

judgments. The amendment seems to have given statutory recognition to the

cursus curiae of original courts pertaining to the production and proof of

documents such as deeds required by law to be attested. When legislative

provisions are inconsistent with legal principles contained in previous judicial

precedent, courts are obliged to apply subsequent legislative provisions which

may have impliedly repealed legal principles contained in such previous judicial

precedent. That is a fundamental legal principle recognized in common law

jurisdictions including Sri Lanka.”

This has been affirmed in K. Dona Nimalawathie and Others vs. P. H.

Dayananda, SC Appeal No. 49/2020, decided on 22.05.2025

Page 10 of 11

“The Act No. 17 of 2022 has specifically stated that the above provision of law

shall apply to the appeals pending on the date of coming into operation of that

Act. Moreover, it has stated that it shall apply notwithstanding anything

contained in the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance. Therefore, although there

is a reference to Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance in the first two questions of

law, Section 154A (3) (a) (ii) of the Civil Procedure Code as amended by the Act

No. 17 of 2022 shall apply to this appeal.”

The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that focus of the court is directed to

matters that are genuinely in dispute and to prevent the courts spending excessive

amount of time on technical proof where no real controversy exists.

It is also evident that at the time the amendment was introduced, Parliament was

mindful that a considerable number of actions and appeals were already pending

before the Courts. These proceedings had been conducted under the earlier

procedural law, wherein the practice of objecting to documents was developed

through cursus curiae and judicial precedent.

Without the implementation of a transitional mechanism, this new procedure

under Section 154A could not have been applied uniformly to those cases without

giving rise to inconsistency. Therefore, the Legislature has enacted Section 3 of the

Amendment Act to provide a proper transition from the former practice to the new

statutory regime.

Thus, Section 3 gives immediate effect to the intention of the legislature contained

in Section 154A and aids the litigants to derive the benefits of its purpose from the

date of commencement rather than being delayed until the final disposal of all pre-

existing actions.

The Defendant in the present case has failed to object to the documents at the end

of the trial, and the Plaintiff has failed to read them as evidence at the close of his

case. On a purposive construction of Section 3, it is the absence of an objection at

closing, as opposed to the formality of reading, that attracts the statutory

consequences. Accordingly, P7, having been challenged at the time of production

Page 11 of 11

and thereafter left unchallenged at the close of the Plaintiff’s case, must be treated

as duly admitted in evidence.

On the question of damages, both the learned District Judge and the Appellate

Court have concurrently found that the Plaintiff failed to adduce either oral or

documentary evidence establishing the loss alleged to have been sustained. In the

absence of any material demonstrating error in those findings, I see no basis upon

which this Court should interfere.

Accordingly, I answer Question of Law No. 1 in the affirmative and Question of Law

No. 2 in the negative.

For the foregoing reasons, the Judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court of

Kalutara in SC/Appeal/No.192/2025 is set aside, and the Judgment in the Civil

Appellate High Court of Kalutara in SC/Appeal/No. 191/2025 relating to the

damages claim is affirmed for the reasons set out above.

The parties shall bear their own costs.
