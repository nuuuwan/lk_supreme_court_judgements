"damaged vehicle should remain at the workshop of the Defendant and the Defendant should be"
"responsible for any deterioration till the dispute is resolved."
"It  must  be  noted  that  the  money  spent  by  the  Plaintiff  to  provide  spare  parts  as  per  P10  is  Rs."
"1,146,288/-. Since the learned High Court Judge disregarded P10 as a document that had not been"
"proved, he has considered the amount spent for such spare parts as Rs. 10 million- vide page 398."
"However, these spare parts, as per the evidence, were either to repair or upgrade the engine. When"
"the accident occurred, the vehicle was on the hoist but without the engine, and it was the day to"
"hand over the vehicle after fixing the repaired engine- vide pages 74 and 117 of the Plaintiffâ€™s"
"evidence. Thus, the money spent for spare parts for the repair or upgrade of the engine could not"
"have been affected by the accident unless the court has to consider the vehicle as fully condemned"
"after the accident."
"The learned High Court Judge has also considered the Rs.3.7 million spent for buying the car as"
"part of the calculated damages. This was bought in 2004 when the odometer reading was 1100Kms,"
"and when it was handed over to the Defendant for repairs, the odometer reading was 28000 Kms"
"and  there  was  an  issue  of  low  oil  pressure. These  factors  indicate  that  there  should  have  been"
"natural wear and tear after buying the vehicle, which may depreciate the value. It is also revealed"
"in evidence that the tyres were replaced after buying the vehicle, which cost Rs.500,000/-. This is"
"the part of the expenses considered by the learned High Court Judge as expenses after buying the"
"vehicle, but when odometer reads 28000 Kms, the value of these tyres cannot be the same. Thus,"
"in my view, calculating damages as per the expenses made by the Plaintiff cannot be the correct"
"method of calculating the damage caused to the vehicle by the accident. Now I endeavor to see"
"how it could have been calculated by the learned High Court Judge."
"Damages are offered to restore the harm caused by the fault of the Defendant. If the vehicle was"
"fully  condemned  after  the  accident,  naturally,  it  should  be  the  market  value  of  the  vehicle  that"
"should have been considered. However, there does not appear to be any evidence that the vehicle"
"was condemned or that its condition became unrepairable for one to use it for safe travel. In fact,"
"both the parties at the beginning agreed to repair it as per the proposal made by the Defendant in"
"accordance with Tax Estimate marked as P1, which included the replacement of the bodyshell with"
"a  new  bodyshell,  indicating  both  parties  agreed  that  it  could  be  restored.  It  appears  that  as  the"
"Insurer of the Defendant did not agree to cover the replacement of bodyshell, the Defendant resiled"
