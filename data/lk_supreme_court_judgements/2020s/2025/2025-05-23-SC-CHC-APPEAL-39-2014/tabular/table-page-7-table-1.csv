"granting only Rs. 6,100,000/-. Having considered the evidence learned High Court Judge came to",""
"the following conclusions:",""
"•","That the vehicle was handed over to the Defendant to repair mechanical defects and it was"
"","admitted by the Defendant that there was no defect in the chassis or body of the vehicle."
"","When the accident occurred, the vehicle was within the control of the Defendant in the"
"","Defendant’s workshop and the collusion was caused by an employee of the Defendant who"
"","drove  the  other  vehicle.  Thus,  it  is  clear  that  the  Defendant  Company  is  liable  for  the"
"","collision and it is not relevant whether the other driver was made a party to the action."
"•","That the main issue in the action was in relation to the quantum of damages."
"•","That  the  Plaintiff  had  bought  the  vehicle  for  Rs.  3,750,000/-  and  with  the  subsequent"
"","expenses, 
the  Defendant  had  spent  Rs.  4,500,000/-  which  have  not  been  strongly"
"","challenged."
"•","That, even though the document marked P10 was not properly proved, as per the evidence"
"","there was no dispute that the Plaintiff spent to provide goods worth Rs.1,000,000/- to the"
"","Defendant for the repairs and therefore, the Plaintiff had spent roughly about Rs.5.5 million"
"","for the Vehicle."
"•","That, other than the above, as a consequence of the accident, the Plaintiff had spent Rs."
"","575,000/-  for  his  transport.  Hence,  the  total  damage  caused  to  the  Defendant  is  Rs."
"","6,100,000/-, even though he has prayed for 25 million. Thus, the Plaintiff is entitled to that"
"","Rs.6,100,000/- and for legal interest till the date of decree and for the legal interest for that"
"","total amount till the payment is made in full along with the costs of the case."
"•","That, it appears that the Defendant had the responsibility of providing a bodyshell as the"
"","Defendant itself suggested that on the first occasion, and the Plaintiff was not bound to"
"","accept  a  repaired  bodyshell  as  suggested  by  the  Defendant  later  on.  It  is  not  relevant"
"","whether the insurer of the Defendant was ready to pay for that or not. It appears that damage"
"","caused  to  the  bodyshell  cannot  be  duly  repaired.  Hence,  it  appears  that  the  Defendant"
"","intentionally failed to do the due repairs by providing a new bodyshell to restore the harm"
"","caused by the negligence on the part of the Defendant."
