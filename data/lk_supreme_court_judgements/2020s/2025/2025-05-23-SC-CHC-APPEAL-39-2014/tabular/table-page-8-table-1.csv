"Being aggrieved by the above Commercial High Court Judgment, the Defendant appealed to this"
"Court by his petition of appeal dated 27.01.2014 and prayed to set aside the Commercial High"
"Court Judgment dated 20.12.2013. Subsequently, the Plaintiff also filed another petition of appeal"
"dated 17.02.2014, seeking a revise of the aforementioned Commercial High Court Judgment while"
"praying for the reliefs originally Plaintiff sought for through his Plaint."
"As parties agreed to limit their submissions to the quantum of damages, this judgment will consider"
