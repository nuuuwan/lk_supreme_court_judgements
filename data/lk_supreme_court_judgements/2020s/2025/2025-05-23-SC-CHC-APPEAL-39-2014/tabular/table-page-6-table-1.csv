"Thereafter, the case proceeded to trial and the parties recorded their admissions and raised their"
"issues.  Four  admissions  were  recorded  by  the  parties.  Issues  No.  01  to  06  were  raised  by  the"
"Plaintiff and the Defendant raised Issues No. 07 to 13."
"During the trial, Francis Milton Kevin Noronha, the Plaintiff gave evidence and closed his case"
"after  that  dayâ€™s  proceedings  on  05.06.2008,  but  the  Counsel  for  the  Defendant  reiterated  the"
"objections  stating  that  P11,  P12,  and  P12A  were  marked  subject  to  proof.  It  appears  that  on"
"03.12.2008, the new Counsel for the Plaintiff had moved for permission to call few more witnesses"
"to prove aforesaid documents. Thereafter, the said Counsel has called one Anoma Abewickrama"
"to prove P11, and mark its original as P11A, and another witness named D.B.de Silva was called"
"on 02.03.2009, without any objection, to mark a new document P13 which is a valuation of the"
"vehicle to indicate the market value of the vehicle as if no accident had occurred. After that Plaintiff"
"has been re-called to give evidence and the Plaintiffs case was finally closed on 06.08.2009 and"
"the Counsel for the Defendant had reiterated the objection for P10, P12 and P12A. However, there"
"was no objection to P10 when it was read in evidence at the first occasion the Plaintiff intended to"
"close his case prior to the Counsel for the Plaintiff moved permission to lead further evidence to"
"prove documents. Thus, the P10, even though the learned High Court Judge has disregarded as not"
"proved, need not be considered as not proved as such objection was not reiterated on 05.06.2008"
"for  the  Counsel  of  the  Plaintiff  to  re-consider  whether  he  should  call  witnesses  to  prove  it."
"However, even though the Counsel for the Plaintiff moved permission to call a witness to prove"
"P12,  no  evidence  of  the  authors  of  that  document  was  led  to  prove  P12. As  such  P12  is  not"
"acceptable evidence. Even though, one Hewaka Sugath Amarasooriya was called to give evidence"
"before  the  District  Court,  on  behalf  of  the  Defendant,  it  appears  that  his  evidence  was  not"
"completed before the District Court, as the learned District Judge decided to transfer the case to"
"Commercial High Court of Colombo. One Jayantha Fernando, the Head of the Service Department"
"in the Defendant company has given evidence before the Commercial High Court Judge on behalf"
"of the Defendant. It appears that no challenge has been made against this order dated 06.11.2011"
"to transfer the action to the Commercial High Court. The parties had in fact agreed with the said"
"decision- vide proceedings dated 02.09.2011."
"Thereafter,  the  learned  Judge  of  the  Commercial  High  Court  delivered  the  Judgment  dated"
"20.12.2013 in favour of the Plaintiff but limited the quantum of damages awarded to the Plaintiff,"
