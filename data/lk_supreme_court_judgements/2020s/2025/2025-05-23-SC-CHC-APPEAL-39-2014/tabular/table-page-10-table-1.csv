"from  going  ahead  with  that  proposal.  Disagreement  of  the  Insurer  is  a  matter  between  the"
"Defendant and the Insurer and should not be a matter to be concerned in deciding the obligations"
"between the Defendant and the Plaintiff. By offering to repair in accordance with P1, the Defendant"
"appear to have shown that the replacement of bodyshell was necessary to restore the vehicle to"
"previous position. It is true that the estimate contained in P1 was done by the Defendant, but it has"
"not been challenged properly to show that the total amount mentioned in said P1 is not the value"
"of repairs needed for restoration. No other estimate, taken from any other institution for the cost"
"of restoration, has been tendered in evidence. Of course, a valuation by De Silva Motor Engineers"
"has  been  marked  as  P13,  but,  as  per  the  evidence  of  the  witness  who  came  to  testify  for  that"
"valuation, it shows the value of the vehicle based on the current price prior to the accident, in other"
"words,  the  market  price  of  the  vehicle  at  the  given  time. As  per  the  said  report,  the  value  is"
"Rs.6,780,000/-. This could have been considered as the damage or compensation for the vehicle if"
"the vehicle was fully condemned as one that cannot be safely used again even after repairs. If the"
"said witness, who came to testify to the correctness of P13, valued the vehicle as it was after the"
"accident,  or  estimated  the  value  of  the  repairs  needed  to  restore  it,  the  difference  between  the"
"market value and the value as it was or the value of the repairs that were needed to restore, could"
"have been considered as the damages to the vehicle. There was no material to say that the vehicle"
"was in such a condition after the accident that made it difficult to restore it to the condition that it"
"had before the accident. It appears that the Defendant attempted to pacify the harm caused by the"
"accident by providing another vehicle in replacement of the vehicle met with the accident. Two"
"vehicles have been offered at different times in that regard; Benz and another Mitsubishi Evolution"
"VIII. If the vehicle was to be replaced, then it had to be similar to the market value of the vehicle"
"that met with the accident. There is no sufficient material to say that these attempts to replace it"
"with another vehicle is reasonable as there is no evidence with regard to their valuation to show"
"their value was similar to the market value of the vehicle of the Plaintiff. In fact, it appears that"
"their values were less than the estimate of De Silva Motor Engineers."
"In fact, it must be noted that even in the letter of demand, other than the incidental expenses, the"
"main claim was for a replacement vehicle or Rs.6,780,000/- or necessary repairs to be done with"
"complete replacement of the body shell."
