"The expenses incurred in India has not been proved by the Plaintiff. On the other hand, they may"
"not be direct damages and depend on many factors such as whether the Plaintiff could be able to"
"get the vehicle exported to India etc. Stress and trauma cannot be valued in monetary terms and"
"not available in an Aquilian action. In relation to the air ticket expenses, no ticket has been marked"
"and no dates have been revealed to consider whether those expenses were before the date of the"
"Plaint or not."
"Hence, only evidence acceptable to indicate the cost to restore the vehicle is contained in P1 which"
"gives the total amount as Rs. 4,214,523.52, which has to be considered as the damaged caused to"
"the vehicle. I do not see any error by the learned High Court Judge in adding the Rs.575,000/-,"
"which appears to be consequential expenses for transport as a result of the accident. Thus, the total"
"damage or compensation has to be considered as Rs.4,789,523.52/- as at the date of accident and"
"the Plaintiff is also entitled to legal interest on that till the date of the Plaint. The Plaintiff is entitled"
"to claim legal interest on the aggregate amount from the date of the Plaint till the full amount is"
"recovered. The Plaintiff is the owner of the vehicle which was damaged and thus is entitled to the"

"the damaged vehicle with the repaired engine, the Plaintiff is entitled to the market value of the"

"interest on that till the date of the Plaint and also to legal interest on the aggregate amount from"
"the  date  of  Plaint  till  the  full  sum  is  recovered.  However,  if  the  condition  of  the  vehicle  has"
"deteriorated due to leaving it with the Defendant owing to the fact there was no settlement to the"
"liking of the Plaintiff, that cannot be a reason to enhance the aforesaid damages. Thus, the claim"
"in the Plaint for a sum of Rs.25,000,000/- is clearly exorbitant and cannot be justified."
"The Defendant in his written submissions referring to ‘McGregor on Damages’, 21st Edition,"
"Sweet  and  Maxwell,  has  referred  to  the  principles  of  ‘Mitigation  of  Damages’.  However,  the"
"calculation  of  damages  by  this  Court  as  explained  above  cannot  be  avoided  by  any  reasonable"
"action  or  step  that  may  have  taken  by  the  Plaintiff.  In  the  above  calculation,  I  do  not  see  any"
"reasonably avoidable loss. What has been decided as damages is what is necessary for the purpose"
"of making good the loss occurred to the Defendant due to the Defendant’s breach of duty. However,"
