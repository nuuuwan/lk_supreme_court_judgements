"","“No person shall be arrested except according to procedure laid down by"
"","law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest”"
"29.","In the instant application, two arguments were raised by the Petitioner"
"","in  this  regard.  Firstly,  that  due  process  was  not  followed  in  making  the"
"","arrest  as  the  arrest  took  place  albeit  summons  being  issued  for  the"
"","Petitioner to appear in Court on 13.03.2013 and secondly, that he was not"
"","informed of the reason for arrest."
"30.","Regarding  the  first  argument,  in  the  case  of  Joseph  Perera  Alias"
"","Bruten  Perera  v  Attorney  General  [1  Sri  LR  1992  199  at  page  236]"
"","the following is noted with regards to making an arrest:"
"","“
The principles and provisions relating to arrest are materially different"
"","from those applying to the determination of the guilt or innocence of the"
"","arrested  person.  One 
is  at  or  near 
the  starting-point  of  criminal"
"","proceedings  while 
the 
other 
constitutes 
the 
termination 
of 
those"
"","proceedings and is made by the judge after hearing submissions from all"
"","parties.  The  power  of  arrest  does  not  depend  on  the  requirement  that"
"","there must be clear and sufficient proof of the commission of the offence"
"","alleged. On the other hand, for an arrest a mere reasonable suspicion or"
"","a reasonable complaint of the commission of an offence suffices.”"
"31.","The  manner  in  which  an  arrest  ought  to  be  conducted  is  provided  in"
"","section 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 which"
"reads:",""
"","“(1) In making an arrest the person making the same shall actually touch"
"","or  confine  the  body  of  the  person  to  be  arrested  unless  there  be  a"
"","submission to the custody by word or action and shall inform the person"
"","to be arrested of the nature of the charge or allegation upon which he is"
"","arrested."
