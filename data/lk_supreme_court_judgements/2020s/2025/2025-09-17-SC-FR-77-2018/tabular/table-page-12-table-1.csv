"","(2) If such person forcibly resists the endeavour to arrest him or attempts"
"","to evade the arrest, the person making the arrest may use such means"
"","as are reasonably necessary to effect the arrest.”"
"32.","In the instant application, as per the “B” Report 17/2018, the Petitioner"
"","was arrested for commission of offences under sections 314 and 316 of the"
"","Penal Code read in conjunction with section 32."
"33.","As  per  schedule  1  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  (No.  15  of"
"","1979), persons who are suspected of committing offences under S.314, and"
"","S.316 may be arrested without a warrant by a peace officer. Therefore, in"
"","the  case  at  hand,  I  am  of  the  opinion  that  due  process  was  followed  in"
"","making the arrest as the arrest was not arbitrary and was a result of an"
"","investigation  conducted  by  the  Police  following  a  complaint  they  had"
"","received against the Petitioner."
"34.","The  Petitioner  also  alleges 
that 
the  reasons 
for  arrest  were  not"
"","communicated  at  the  time  of  arrest.  In  response  to  this  the  2nd  and  3rd"
"Respondents","have 
taken 
up 
the 
position 
that 
the 
reason  was"
"","communicated both at the time of making the arrest and when getting the"
"Petitioner’s  statement.  The","latter 
is  also  reflected 
in  the  Petitioner’s"
"statement","to 
the  police  upon  getting  arrested 
(see 
“R9”). 
In 
these"
"","circumstances,  I  am  inclined  to  believe  that  the  reason  for  arrest  was"
"","communicated to the Petitioner."
"35.","Therefore, I am of the opinion that due process was in fact followed by"
"","the  Respondents  in  making  the  arrest  and  that  there  is  no  violation  of"
"","Article 13 (1) of the Constitution."
