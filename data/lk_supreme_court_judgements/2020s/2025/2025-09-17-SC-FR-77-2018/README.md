K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J

1. The Petitioner is a citizen of Sri Lanka who is engaged in a business known

as Gaya Bakers since 2012. He alleges that the 1st - 4th Respondents

violated fundamental rights guaranteed to him under Articles 11, 12(1),

12(2), 13(1), and 13(5) of the Constitution. This Court granted leave for the

alleged violations of Articles 12 (1) and 13 (1) of the Constitution.

The Facts

2. The Petitioner is a member of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)

where he obtained membership in 2017. Mr. H.A. Munaff and Mrs. Yohara

Ummah (husband and wife respectively) were known to the Petitioner

owing to them being candidates in the additional list for the Kaththankudy

Urban Council of SLPP.

3. The Petitioner states that the aforementioned Mr. H.A. Munaff was arrested

as a suspect for the possession of cannabis in a house rented by him

between 19:00 20:00 hours on or around the 7th of January 2018. On the

same day, two individuals claiming to be from the Criminal Investigation

Division (CID), having arrived at the residence of the aforementioned

Yohara Ummah, had demanded Rs. 250,000 to release Mr. H.A. Munaff

from police custody. Yohara Ummah, suspecting the veracity of their

identities, had called the Petitioner stating she was in danger.

4. Upon receiving this call, the Petitioner states that he immediately went to

the residence of Yohara Ummah with some friends. The two individuals

had still been there. Upon questioning the individuals and realizing they

are not police officers, he has called 119 and reported the incident to the

Police, whereby the Police had come and arrested the individuals. The

Petitioner has later got to know that Yohara Ummah had lodged a

4

complaint about this incident to the Kaththankudy police upon the arrest

of the individuals.

5. Thereafter, on the 9th of January 2018 the Petitioner has received a call

from the Kaththankudy Police Station stating that he is required to give a

statement regarding the aforementioned incident. As the Petitioner was

not in Kaththankudy at the time, he had communicated his difficulty to

attend, requesting a further date.

6. Later, the Petitioner has become aware that the 2nd Respondent has

reported a false story in relation to case No. B/17/2018 to the learned

Magistrate of Batticaloa stating that the Petitioner had assaulted the

aforementioned individuals who claimed to be CID officials and that the

Petitioner has disappeared from the area. It is the contention of the

Petitioner that this was done in order to obtain arrest warrants against the

Petitioner and his friends. He further submits that the aforementioned

individuals who claimed to be CID officials had been hospitalized by the

Respondents with the intention of obtaining an arrest warrant as well.

7. The Petitioner submits that the issuing of such warrant was refused by the

Learned Magistrate of Batticaloa and that instead, the Learned Magistrate

had issued summons to the Petitioner alongside two others to appear

before the Magistrates Court on the 13th of March 2018.

8. He submits that the SLPP main rally for the 2018 Local Government

Elections was to be held on the 26th of January 2018 and that he played

an active role in its organization. He states that the above false B report

that was filed in the Magistrates Court of Batticaloa was done with the

intention of preventing the Petitioners involvement in the aforementioned

rally.

9. Thereafter, on the 20th of January, the Petitioner states that he was illegally

arrested by the 3rd and 4th Respondents albeit the refusal by the Learned

5

Magistrate to issue an arrest warrant. At the time of the arrest, the

Petitioner had been at a friends house, in close proximity to the Police

Station of Kaththankudy.

10. The Petitioner states that he was treated in a degrading and humiliating

manner in being arrested publicly and that reasons for arrest were not

disclosed by the 3rd and 4th Respondents even at the police station. He

further contends that he was arrested by officers who are usually

entrusted with other duties officers in the traffic police attire. Upon being

produced before the Learned Magistrate of Batticaloa on the 21st of

January 2018, the Learned Magistrate had enlarged the Petitioner on bail.

The Petitioner states that this impugned arrest caused an irreparable

damage to him during the election campaign and that it was carried out

contrary to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, further

stating that he was deprived of the equal protection of the law having being

discriminated against on grounds of political opinion. Whereby, he submits

that fundamental rights guaranteed to him under Articles 11, 12(1), 12(2),

13(1), and 13(5) of the Constitution were in violation.

11. The 2nd and 3rd Respondents in their affidavit state that on the 7th of

January 2018, Hanifa Abdul Munaf was arrested at 23:30 hours for having

34 kilograms of cannabis in possession and that he was subsequently

produced before the Magistrate on 08th of January 2018.

12. The Respondents submit that a call was made to 119 on 08th of

January 2018 at 01:24 hours and that a statement of Kalandara Lebbe

Jafer was recorded on 08th of January 2018 at 02:20 hours. The

Respondents, in their written submissions provide that prompt action was

taken by them to arrest the alleged suspects with regards to this complaint.

13. In relation to B Report 17/2018, the Respondents submit that a

complaint was lodged by Asath alleging that the Petitioner, together with

other persons had assaulted him. The complainant had been produced

6

before the judicial medical officer on the same date. It is submitted that on

the 20th of January 2018, the Petitioner was made aware of the alleged

assault committed by him and was arrested at 23:00 hours in front of the

Kaththankudy Police Station and that the Petitioners statement was

recorded therein. The Petitioner has then been produced before the

Magistrates Court.

14. The Respondents further submit that due process was followed in

arresting the Petitioner and that the reasons for arrest were communicated

to the Petitioner as admitted by the Petitioner himself in his statement

made to the police. Further, it is stated that the 3rd Respondent has never

carried out duties attached to the traffic unit and that the 4th Respondent

was not involved in the arrest on any level. It is their contention that the

Petitioner is attempting to fabricate a story.

My Observations

15. Given the vast inconsistencies between the two factual backgrounds

presented to this Court, I am compelled to, upon the perusal of the material

before me, note the following.

16. The Petitioners state that B Report No.17/2018 states that the

Petitioner had assaulted the two individuals who claimed to be CID officials

and that it was on this basis that a case was filed in the Magistrates Court.

The aforementioned B Report is submitted to this Court marked R 10

and it presents a completely different version.

17. According to the B Report, on the 8th of January one Asath, having

had dinner had been returning home. Where one Kaleel has stopped him

and his friend Najath stating that Asath was the one who informed the

police of the possession of cannabis by the individual who was arrested for

the same on the same day. They had then been assaulted by the Petitioner

and one Siraj Ahamed and taken to a secondary location, a house. They

7

had then learned that this was the same house where cannabis was

previously found, and an arrest was made. The aforementioned Kaleel has

told Asath and Najath had come to this house to receive money. They had

then been brought to the police. The B Report notes that this is an offence

in terms of sections 314 and 316 to be read in conjunction with section 32

of the Penal Code. The report also provides that the suspects (the

Petitioner, Kaleel and Siraj Ahamed) are absconding and moved for a date

to produce the suspects before the Magistrates Court.

18. I must also note that the Petition repeatedly mentions of a refusal to

issue an arrest warrant to arrest the Petitioner by the Learned Magistrate.

The same was also submitted at the hearing by the Counsel for the

Petitioner. However, I fail to find any material to support such a claim that

there was an application to issue a warrant to arrest the Petitioner.

According to the B report, police have only moved for a further date to

produce the suspects. Whereby I am inclined to believe such was merely

an attempt to mislead the Court by stating that applications for a warrant

of arrest was refused by the learned Magistrate.

19. Having resolved the inconsistencies and clarified the factual

background, I will move to discuss any possible violation of fundamental

rights.

Alleged violation of Fundamental Rights

20. The standard of proof required in cases filed under Article 126 of the

Constitution for infringement of Fundamental Rights is proof by a

preponderance of the probabilities, as in a civil case, rather than proof

beyond a reasonable doubt, as said in the case of Velmurugu v. The

Attorney General and Others [1981] 1 Sri LR 406.

21. Further, in Gunawardene v. Perera and Others [1983] 1 Sri LR 305

at 313, Soza J. held that

8

...It is generally accepted that within this standard there could be

varying degrees of probability. The degree of probability required should

be commensurate with the gravity of the allegation sought to be proved.

This court when called upon to determine questions of infringement of

fundamental rights will insist on a high degree of probability as for

instance a court having to decide a question of fraud in a civil suit would.

The conscience of the court must be satisfied that there has been an

infringement.

Alleged violation of Article 12(1)

22. Article 12(1) of the Constitution provides:

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection

of the law.

23. Looking at the jurisprudential development vis--vis Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution, it must be noted that it is rich in interpretation. In

Palihawadana v. Attorney General & Others (1978-79-80) 1 Sri LR 65

at page 68 Shravananda J. comprehensively interprets Article 12 (1) as

follows:

Article 12 of the Constitution lays down the general rule of equality

that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal

protection of the law and that no citizen shall be discriminated against

on grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political opinion, place

of birth or any of such grounds.

His Lordship goes on to further analyse its applicability in the following way

in page 69:

Though Article 12 prescribes equality before the law and equal

protection of the law, it has to be recognized that equality in any literal

or abstract sense is not attainable. Its strict enforcement will, in fact,

9

bring about the very situation it seeks to avoid. The fundamental act is,

all men are alike. Some, by the mere accident of birth, inherit riches;

others are born to poverty. Some acquire skills and qualifications while

others are untrained. There are differences in social standing and

economic status. It is, therefore, impossible to apply rules of abstract

equality to conditions which predicate inequality from the start. Yet the

words have meaning. What is postulated is equality of treatment to all

persons in utter disregard of every conceivable circumstance of the

difference, such as age, sex, education and so on and so forth as may be

found amongst people in general. Indeed, while the object of the Article

is to ensure that invidious distinction or arbitrary discrimination shall not

be made by the State between citizen A and citizen B who answer the

same description and the differences which may obtain between them

are of no relevance for the purpose of applying a particular law or

operating an administrative scheme, reasonable classification is

permissible and a certain measure of inequality permitted. The State is

permitted to make unequal laws or take unequal administrative action if

it is dealing with individuals or groups whose circumstances and

situations are different.

24. It must also be noted that the scope of Article 12 (1) has significantly

widened over the years. Cases such as Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports

Authority [SC/FR/ 256/2017 S.C. Minutes of 11 December 2020] which

captures this change as follows:

The concept of equality was originally aimed at preventing

discrimination based on or due to such immutable and acquired

characteristics, which do not on their own make human being unequal. It

is now well accepted that, the right to equality covers a much wider

area, aimed at preventing other injustices too, that are recognized by

law. Equality is now a right as opposed to a mere privilege or an

entitlement, and in the context of Sri Lanka a Fundamental Right,

conferred on the people by the Constitution, for the purpose of curing not

10

only injustices taking the manifestation of discrimination, but a host of

other maladies recognized by law.

25. I must also note that Article 12 (1) has often been a catalyst in

protecting ones right to not be discriminated against on grounds of

political opinion, as witnessed in cases such as U. N. S. P.

Kurukulasuriya and J. K. W. Jayasekara v. Sri Lanka Rupavahini

Corporation and others [SC FR Application No. 556/2008 SC FR

Application No. 557/2008 SC Minutes of 17. 02. 2021], Deshapriya

and Another v. Municipal Council, Nuwara Eliya and Others [SC FR

884/92] 1995 1 Sri LR page 362, and Palihawadana v. Attorney

General & Others (1978-79-80) 1 Sri LR 65.

26. The Petitioner in the instant application contends that his Article 12 (1)

protections were taken away by way of discrimination on grounds of

political opinion as he believes the arrest was made to hinder his

participation in SLPP activities. There is no evidence to back this claim

except for the fabricated story the Petitioner presents to this Court, which

I have previously dealt with and concluded to be factually untrue.

27. To award protection under Article 12 (1) in cases such as the instant

application, where there is absolutely no material to conclude

discrimination on any basis, in my opinion is not only illogical but also an

abuse of Constitutional protections guaranteed by way of fundamental

rights. Therefore, I am of the opinion that, as there are no credible grounds

to conclude discrimination based on political opinion, there is no violation

of Article 12 (1).

Alleged Violation of Article 13 (1)

28. Article 13 of the Constitution concerns the due process of arrest and

detention. Therein, Article 13 (1) provides as follows:

11

No person shall be arrested except according to procedure laid down by

law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest

29. In the instant application, two arguments were raised by the Petitioner

in this regard. Firstly, that due process was not followed in making the

arrest as the arrest took place albeit summons being issued for the

Petitioner to appear in Court on 13.03.2013 and secondly, that he was not

informed of the reason for arrest.

30. Regarding the first argument, in the case of Joseph Perera Alias

Bruten Perera v Attorney General [1 Sri LR 1992 199 at page 236]

the following is noted with regards to making an arrest:

The principles and provisions relating to arrest are materially different

from those applying to the determination of the guilt or innocence of the

arrested person. One is at or near the starting-point of criminal

proceedings while the other constitutes the termination of those

proceedings and is made by the judge after hearing submissions from all

parties. The power of arrest does not depend on the requirement that

there must be clear and sufficient proof of the commission of the offence

alleged. On the other hand, for an arrest a mere reasonable suspicion or

a reasonable complaint of the commission of an offence suffices.

31. The manner in which an arrest ought to be conducted is provided in

section 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 which

reads:

(1) In making an arrest the person making the same shall actually touch

or confine the body of the person to be arrested unless there be a

submission to the custody by word or action and shall inform the person

to be arrested of the nature of the charge or allegation upon which he is

arrested.

12

(2) If such person forcibly resists the endeavour to arrest him or attempts

to evade the arrest, the person making the arrest may use such means

as are reasonably necessary to effect the arrest.

32. In the instant application, as per the B Report 17/2018, the Petitioner

was arrested for commission of offences under sections 314 and 316 of the

Penal Code read in conjunction with section 32.

33. As per schedule 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (No. 15 of

1979), persons who are suspected of committing offences under S.314, and

S.316 may be arrested without a warrant by a peace officer. Therefore, in

the case at hand, I am of the opinion that due process was followed in

making the arrest as the arrest was not arbitrary and was a result of an

investigation conducted by the Police following a complaint they had

received against the Petitioner.

34. The Petitioner also alleges that the reasons for arrest were not

communicated at the time of arrest. In response to this the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents have taken up the position that the reason was

communicated both at the time of making the arrest and when getting the

Petitioners statement. The latter is also reflected in the Petitioners

statement to the police upon getting arrested (see R9). In these

circumstances, I am inclined to believe that the reason for arrest was

communicated to the Petitioner.

35. Therefore, I am of the opinion that due process was in fact followed by

the Respondents in making the arrest and that there is no violation of

Article 13 (1) of the Constitution.

13

36. In the above premise, I declare that the fundamental rights that have

been guaranteed to the petitioners under Articles 12 (1), and 13 (1) of

the Constitution have not been violated.

Application is Dismissed.
