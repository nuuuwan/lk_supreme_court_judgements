"1","5.3  Here  while 
I  am  facing  a  risk  of  getting  a  conviction  by  the  M.C.  and"
"","simultaneously a disenrollment by the S.C."
"1","5.4 This dangerous risk is totally due to the illegality in the procedure and violation"

"","convicted. When that condition is not satisfied, suspension is illegal."
"1","5.5.7 So it is totally incorrect to state that acting under the proviso to Section 42"

is"
"","untenable and unlawful."
