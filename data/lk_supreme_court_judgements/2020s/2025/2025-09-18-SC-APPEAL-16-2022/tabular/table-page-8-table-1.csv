"At   the   inquiry,   only   the   Director   (Revenue)   of   the   Land   Reform   Commission"
"(hereinafter   referred   to   as   the   ‘LRC’)   and   the   General   Manager   of   Elpitiya"
"Plantations PLC had given statements, which are filed of record. In his statement, the"
"officer of the  Land Reform Commission challenged the validity of Extraordinary"
"Gazette Notification No. 181/12 dated February 27, 1982."
"However,   the   validity   of   the   Gazette   notification   cannot   be   challenged   in   a"
"proceeding of this nature, namely, an inter-pleader action."
"Be that as it may, the Director of the LRC, in his statement, challenged the validity of"
"the Gazette notification on two grounds. The first ground is that the notice is said to"
"have been published under Section ‘42එච්’  read together with Section 27ඒ  of the"
"Land Reform Law; however, as there is no Section ‘27ඒ’  in the Act, the notice is"
"allegedly defective. When comparing the sections of the Act and the statements of the"
"Director of the 'LRC' carefully, it  is readily apparent that the letters ‘42එච්’  and"
"‘27ඒ’, though written in Sinhala, correspond to the English text ‘42H’ and ‘27A’."
"The second ground is that compensation for the land acquired was not paid to the"
"LRC by the SLSPC. However, Section 27A (1) of the  Land Reform Law specifies"
"that a vesting order of any estate land to a corporation should specify the terms and"
"conditions  “(...)relating   to   consideration   for   the   vesting   of   that   land   in   such"
"Corporation   as   may   be   agreed   upon   between  
the   Commission   and   such"
"Corporation.” 
In   my   view,   these   words   do   not   mean   that   consideration   must"
"necessarily be paid for the land vested to a corporation. Rather, all that is required is"
"that the order contain  “conditions relating to consideration for the vesting of the"
"land.”  Accordingly,   Gazette   Notification   No.   181/12   dated   February   27,   1982,"
"contained conditions stating that no consideration is payable in respect of the land."
"“මෙ(cid:3)කී ඉඩ(cid:3) මෙ(cid:8)නුමෙ(cid:8)න් මෙ(cid:11)විය යුතු මුදල පිළිබද කිසියම්  මෙ(cid:25)(cid:26)මෙ(cid:27)(cid:26)න්දු(cid:8)ක් මෙ(cid:30)(cid:26)(cid:31) ගිවිසු(cid:3)ක්"
"ඇතුලත් මෙ$(cid:26)මෙ%.”"
"Therefore, in any event, the claim put forward by the LRC challenging the validity of"
"the Gazette has no merit."
