"b) refer the claim or dispute for determination as hereinafter provided."

"When   Section   10(1)   is   read   in   isolation,   one   might   gain   the   impression   that   the"
"decision of the Acquiring Officer is only confined to the claims made before him."
"However, as I have already stated above, the Acquiring Officer conducting an inquiry"
"is expected to summon any person whose evidence is likely to be material to the"
"subject   matter,   and   to   require   the   production   of   any   document   likely   to   contain"
"information necessary to  determine the interest of that person  or  of any other"
"person in the land."
"Consequently, the Acquiring Officer is expected to diligently determine not only the"
"rights of the claimants who have submitted claims, but also the rights of any other"
"persons who, despite not having made a claim, hold an interest whatsoever in the"
"land. As such, not only the claimants but also those with interests in the land should"
"be considered 'parties' to the dispute, to whom the Acquiring Officer is required to"
"give notice of his decision after the inquiry, in terms of Section 10(1)(a) of the Land"
"Acquisition Act. Accordingly, any person having an interest in the land who ought to"
"have been summoned by the Acquiring Officer, but was not, must be regarded as a"
"necessary party to the dispute. In this context, it is relevant to dig into the legal"
"definition of the word 'necessary party'. The Black's Law dictionary  7  provides the"
"meaning of the word as follows."
