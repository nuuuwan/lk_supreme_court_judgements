"SLSPC, the Civil Appellate High Court of the Southern Province holden at Galle"
"granted leave to appeal and thereafter proceeded to hear the appeal."
"The   learned   High   Court   Judges   also   distinguished   the   facts   of  Perera   v.   Dingiri"
"Menike20  on   the   ground   that,   in   that   case,   the   party   sought   to   be   added   was   a"
"complete  outsider  who  had  not  made  any  claim  before  the Acquiring  Officer.  In"
"contrast, in the instant case, neither the 1st  Defendant, LRC, nor the 2nd  Defendant,"
"Elpitiya Plantations PLC, both of whom made claims before the Acquiring Officer"
"for   compensation   holds   title   to   the   subject   land.  The   learned   High   Court   Judges"
"observed that the learned District Judge failed to consider the attributes of property"
"rights, bearing in mind that the 2nd Defendant, Elpitiya Plantations PLC, is merely a"
"lessee holding leasehold rights under the 3rd Defendant, SLSPC, who is the owner of"
"the property. Therefore, despite this procedural defect, it is clearly apparent from the"
"grounds stated above in this judgment that the SLSPC is a necessary party to the"
"Acquiring Officerâ€™s inquiry."
"Accordingly, the learned High Court Judges held that the learned District Judge erred"
"in law and set aside the order of the learned District Judge and directed the District"
"Judge to hold an inquiry based on the issues raised by all parties, including the 3rd"
"Defendant, the SLSPC."
