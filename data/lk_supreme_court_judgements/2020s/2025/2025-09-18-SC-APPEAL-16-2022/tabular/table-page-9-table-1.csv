"Decision Following the Acquiring Officer’s Inquiry"
"Consequent to the inquiry, the Acquiring Officer referred the dispute to the District"
"Court of Galle in terms of Section 10 of the Land Acquisition Act, by plaint dated"
"March 3, 2015. The LRC and Elpitiya Plantations Company, now known as Elpitiya"
"Plantations   PLC,   were   named   as   the   1st  and   2nd  Defendants,   respectively.   The"
"Acquiring Officer informed Court that both the LRC and Elpitiya Plantations PLC"
"had submitted their claims to him in terms of Section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act,"
"and that, having inquired into those claims, he was unable to determine the title to the"
"land in order to award compensation. Accordingly, he requested the District Court to"
"decide the dispute and determine the title1."
"Proceedings Before the District Court"
"The   1st  Defendant,   LRC,   submitted   its   statement   of   claim   to   the   District   Court,"
"seeking a declaration that it is the absolute owner of the subject matter and, therefore,"
"entitled to receive compensation for the acquired land. The  2nd  Defendant, Elpitiya"
"Plantations PLC, filed a statement of claim seeking a declaration that it is entitled to"
"compensation   for   the   land   acquired   and   that   it   is   the   lawful   lessee   who   was   in"
"possession of the land."
"Undoubtedly, the 2nd  Defendant, Elpitiya Plantations PLC, is the lawful long-term"
"lessee of the SLSPC. However, under the law of Sri Lanka, no distinction is drawn"
"between short-term and long-term leases.  As pointed out by Hutchinson C.J in the"
"Abdul Azeez v. Abdul Rahiman2  case, which was also reproduced in the  Carron v"
"Fernando3 case, ""A lessee under a valid lease from the owner is dominus or owner"
"for the term of his lease. He is owner during that term as against all the world,"
"including   his   lessor"".Nevertheless,   as   against   the   lessor,   the   lessee’s   rights   are"
"confined to those arising under the lease."
