"In any event, issue No. 25 is not a question of law and therefore not an issue that"
"could be decided as a preliminary issue. The learned District Judge, in his order dated"
"February 24, 2020, proceeded to answer the three issues No. 35, 36, and 37. The"
"learned  District  Judge  took  into  account  the   fact  that  the   2nd  Defendant,  Elpitiya"
"Plantations PLC, is the lessee under the lessor, the SLSPC (3rd Defendant). He also"
"considered the explanation in the SLSPC’s statement of claim regarding its inability"
"to make a claim before the Acquiring Officer, stating that, since it did not have prior"
"notice, it was unable to participate in the inquiry."
"Despite this, the learned District Judge gave weight to the 2nd Defendant’s submission"
"that since the 3rd Defendant failed to prefer a claim before the Acquiring Officer, it is"
"not entitled to prefer any claim in the District Court or to obtain any relief."
"The learned District Judge heavily relied on the decision of Basnayake C.J. in the"
"case of  Perera v. Dingiri Menike12. Relying on that decision, the learned District"
"Judge answered issues No. 35(i), (ii), and (iii), as well as issues No. 36 and 37,"
"against   the   3rd  Defendant   and   dismissed   the   claim   made   by   the   3rd  Defendant."
"Consequently, the conflicting claims made by the 1st and 2nd Defendants, who inter-"
"pleaded,   were   fixed   for   inquiry.  At   this   juncture,   it   is   pertinent   to   consider   and"
"compare the facts in Perera v. Dingiri Menike13 (Supra) with the facts of the case at"
"hand."
"In the former case, the disputed claim put forward by the 9th Respondent had been a"
"belated one, made even after the decree had been entered, claiming compensation in"
"respect of a 2/3 share of an extent of 2 acres of land. The 9th Respondent moved that"
"she be added as a Defendant, be permitted to file a statement of claim, and that an"
"inquiry  be  held. The  Court  rejected  the   application  of  the  9th  Respondent  on  the"
"ground   that   her   presence   was   not   necessary   for   the   determination   of   the   dispute"
"referred to the Court by the Government Agent."
"In his judgment, Basnayake C.J. reproduced the following observations made by"
"Withers J. in Templer v. Seneviratne14, which read as follows:"
