"[SC APPEAL 35/2024] - Page 6 of 11"
"dated  25-03-2009  is  erroneous.  The  learned  judges  of  the  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  have"
"considered the discrepancy of the extent of the land in suit (i.e. 10.625 perches as per the"
"plan referred to in the Schedule to the Plaint, as opposed to 14.62 perches as per the Plan"
"prepared upon the commission issued by court). The Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals,"
"for the reasons set out in its judgment dated 09-07-2015, has clearly held that the Plaintiffs"
"have established their title to the land the extent of which is 14.62 perches which is more fully"
"depicted  as  Lots  No.  01  and  02  of  the  Plan  390/ඉ  prepared  by  I.A.  Wijethillake,  Licensed"
"Surveyor. In the course of the trial, this plan has been produced by the Plaintiffs marked අ."
"It is not disputed by the parties that this Plan is the one prepared by the Commissioner upon"
"the Commission issued by the District Court."
"The corpus of the action has been depicted as Lots No. 01 and 02 in Plan No. 390/ඉ prepared"
"by I.A. Wijethillake, Licensed Surveyor. He has identified Lot No. 01 as the part of the land"
"which is presently occupied by the Plaintiffs and Lot No. 02 (which is 5.12 perches in extent)"
"as the part of the land which is presently encroached by the Defendant."
"I  observe  that  the  extent  mentioned in  the  Schedule  to  the Plaint is  10  perches.  That is  a"
"reference to Lot No. 01 in Plan No. 390/ඉ. I also observe that it is Lot No. 02, in Plan No."
"390/ඉ, which the Plaintiffs have complained in this action as the part of the land wrongfully"
"occupied  by  the  Defendant.  It  is  the  addition  of  Lots  No.  01  and  02  which  has  made  the"
"Plaintiffs’ land to be 14.62 perches in extent in extent."
"The Commissioner has tendered to Court, a report by way of an affidavit. In the said report,"
"the Commissioner has specifically stated that Lots No. 01 and 02 have jointly formed the land"
"in suit claimed by the Plaintiffs. The Commissioner has also stated in his report that it was not"
"possible  for  him  to  superimpose  the  Plan  prepared  by  him  on  the  plan  dated  24-05-1915"
"prepared by M.D. Alwis, Licensed Surveyor, which is the plan referred to in the Schedule to"
"the  Plaint.  This  was  because  the  said  plan  dated  24-05-1915  was  not  available  for  the"
"superimposition. The Commissioner has also reported to Court that the Defendant was present"
"at the time he conducted the survey."
"Moreover, the Commissioner has also reported that the part of the construction made by the"
"Defendant, adding a new part to the Defendant’s old house, has been constructed within Lot"
"No.  02,  claimed  by  the  Plaintiff.  I  would  reproduce  below,  the  relevant  portion  from  the"
"affidavit of the Commissioner."
