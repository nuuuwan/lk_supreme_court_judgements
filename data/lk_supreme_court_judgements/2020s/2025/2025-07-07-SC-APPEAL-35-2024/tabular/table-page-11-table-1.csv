"[SC APPEAL 35/2024] - Page 11 of 11"
"High Court of Civil Appeals. With that refusal, the final judgment of the case must be taken"
"as the judgment dated 09-07-2015 pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals."
"It has been entered in favour of the Plaintiffs. It has also directed that a decree be entered"
"as prayed for, by the Plaintiff. The prayer (අ) in the Plaint which is for a declaration of title to"
"the  land  in  suit  must  be  read  with  the  prayer  (ආ)  in  the  Plaint  which  is  for  an  order  to"
"demarcate the Eastern boundary of the said land. Thus, the reference to 10.625 perches in"
"the  original  decree  must  be  taken  as  an  arithmetical  mistake  or  as  an  accidental  slip  or"
"omission, the rectification of which would necessarily bring the decree into conformity with"
"the judgment dated 09-07-2015 pronounced by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals."
"Thus, I am also of the view that the learned District Judge, by his order dated 29-04-2021,"
"rightly  allowed  the  application  of  the  Plaintiffs  to  amend  the  decree  to  include  the  land  in"
"extent of 14.62 perches, instead of the land in extent of 10.625 perches in accordance with"
"Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code. I also agree with the Provincial High Court of Civil"
"Appeals when it concluded in its order dated 18-05-2022, that there is no merit in the Leave"
"to Appeal Application filed by the Defendant in the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals."
"For the foregoing reasons, I answer both the questions of law set out above, in the negative."
"This appeal must therefore stand dismissed with costs."
