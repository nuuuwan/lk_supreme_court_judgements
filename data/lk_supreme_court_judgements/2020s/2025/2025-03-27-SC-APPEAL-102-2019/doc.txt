Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Kegalle on

08.05.1987 seeking to partition the land described in the schedule to the

plaint among the plaintiff and the 1st to 5th defendants. In the plaint, the

2

SC/APPEAL/102/2019

plaintiff stated that he was entitled to an undivided share of the land,

while the balance share devolved on the 1st to 5th defendants.

Following the preliminary survey, the 6th defendant intervened. Thereafter,

the plaintiff filed an amended plaint dated 23.09.1988, in which he claimed

an undivided share of the land and stated that the balance share

should devolve only on the 1st to 3rd defendants.

After trial, by judgment dated 18.10.2001, the District Judge dismissed the

plaintiffs action on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to identify the

corpus. On appeal, by judgment dated 19.05.2009, the High Court affirmed

this finding. However, by order dated 01.10.2010, the Supreme Court

directed a retrial on the basis that the judgments of the lower courts had

been delivered without substituting some of the deceased parties.

There was no existing plan to identify the land at the stage of the preliminary

survey. The land was described in the schedule to the plaint based on the

description in the plaintiffs old deeds. The plaintiff identified the land as

Paranawatta, whereas the contesting defendants identified the whole or

part of the land as Hitinawatta. The plaintiff was not residing on the land,

whereas the contesting defendants were. The contesting defendants have

separate deeds for Hitinawatta.

In his report, the surveyor who prepared the preliminary plan did not state

that he had identified the land described in the schedule to the plaint on

the ground. Instead, he merely recorded the different views expressed by

the parties during the survey regarding the identification of the corpus. The

surveyor was not called to give evidence at the first trial but was called at

the second trial. However, his testimony did not provide a clear

identification of the land. During cross-examination, he admitted that he

could not identify the land either by extent or by boundaries (vide page 234

of the brief).

SC/APPEAL/102/2019

Following the second trial, by judgment dated 31.08.2016, the new District

Judge dismissed the plaintiffs action on the same groundthe failure to

identify the corpus. This decision was again affirmed by the High Court by

judgment dated 08.03.2018.

This Court granted leave to appeal on the same question of identification of

the corpus. During the argument, counsel made brief oral submissions and

informed the Court that they would file further written submissions.

However, none of the parties filed post-argument written submissions.

Having examined the evidenceboth oral and documentaryled in the

case, I find no reason to interfere with the concurrent findings of two District

Judges and four High Court Judges that the plaintiff has failed to identify

the corpus. I dismiss the appeal with costs.
