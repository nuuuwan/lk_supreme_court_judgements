"fell within the same category has been given  relief, which amounts to treating"
"the petitioners differently. He also pointed out that the other officers who became"
"entitled to relief under the other categories mentioned in the said Cabinet Paper"
"have also been granted relief as admitted by the respondents, and leaving the"
"petitioners out from granting relief amounts to a clear discrimination."
"The  learned  DSG  who  represented  the  Hon.  Attorney  General  and  the  other"
"respondents,  submitted  two  legal  arguments  on  the  basis  that  the  petitioners"
"have  no  locus  standi  to  maintain  this  application.  It  was  submitted  that  the"
"petition has been filed beyond the one-month period of the alleged infringement,"
"and the Cabinet of Ministers should have been made parties to the action as it"
"was the decision of the Cabinet that had been challenged. Making submissions"
"as  to  the  facts,  it  was  her  stand  that  the  recommendation  1  and  2  of  the"
"contentious  Cabinet  Decision  could  only  be  applicable  to  those  officers  who"
"retired prior to 18-05-2014 and not to the petitioners who were serving police"
"officers. It was contended that the petitioners, if at all, stand entitle to receive"
"benefits  only  in  terms  of  the  3rd  category  of  officers  mentioned  in  the  Cabinet"
"Decision, which makes them entitled to two special salary increments only."
"It  was  stated  that  all  the  petitioners  have  already  been  granted  two  salary"
"increments pursuant to P5(a) and P5(b), and therefore, they are attempting to"
"misinterpret the said Cabinet Decision though they have already received their"
"entitlement."
"Having  scrutinized 
the  petition  before 
the  Court, 
the  relevant  supporting"
"documents 
filed, 
the  objections 
raised  as 
to 
the  maintainability  of 
this"
"application, and the oral and written submissions, I will now proceed to consider"
"whether  petitioners  are  entitled 
to 
the  reliefs  as  sought,  or  whether 
the"
"fundamental rights application should stand dismissed as contented on behalf"
"of the respondents."
