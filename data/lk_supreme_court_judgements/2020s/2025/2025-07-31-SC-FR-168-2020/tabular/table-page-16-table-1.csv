"I find that what the learned DSG had submitted in her written submissions, that"
"the contention of the petitioners in relation to this petition had been that they"
"also qualify to receive a further promotion, and to have it backdated as stipulated"
"under  the  2nd  recommendation  of  the  Cabinet  Decision,  was  not  correct,"
"whereas, their contention had been to the effect that they are entitled to have"
"the promotions they have already earned after sustaining respective injuries and"
"while being in service backdated to the date of the injury they sustained while"
"being engaged in their official duty."
"Having observed as such, I will now consider the legal objections raised to the"
"effect that the relevant parties have not been named in the petition and that the"
"application  was  out  of  time,  before  moving  on  to  the  facts  of  the  matter,  if"
"necessary."
"It  is  abundantly  clear  that  the  petitioners  have  come  before  the  Court  not  to"
"challenge the Cabinet Memorandum dated 26-03-2015 or the Cabinet Decision"
"taken in that regard on 23-05-2017. They have come before this Court on the"
"basis  that  the  subsequent  actions  of  the  respondents,  where  they  have  been"
"deprived of their entitlements, amounts to violation of their fundamental rights."
"Therefore, it is my view that it was not necessary for the petitioners to name the"
"Cabinet of Ministers as a party to this action."
"A person who alleges that his fundamental rights or language rights have been"
"infringed or is about to be infringed by executive or administrative action needs"
"to come before the Supreme Court within one month thereof in terms of Article"
"126(2) of the Constitution."
"As I have considered earlier, the petitioners have not come before the Court in"
"order to challenge the Cabinet Decision taken on 23-05-2017. It is very much"
"clear  that  with  the  directive  by  the  Secretary  to  the  Cabinet,  to  the  relevant"
"authorities to implement the Cabinet Decision, in fact, the relevant authorities"
"which  include  the  respondents  mentioned  have  taken  steps  to  implement  the"
"same, and had partly implemented the said decision in a phased-out manner."
