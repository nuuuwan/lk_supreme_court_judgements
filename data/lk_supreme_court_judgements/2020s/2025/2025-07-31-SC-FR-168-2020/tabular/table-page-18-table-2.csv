"In  Wijerathna  Vs.  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority,  SC/FR/256/17  SCM"
"11.12.2020, Kodagoda, J. held:"
"“The concept of ‘equality’ was originally aimed at preventing discrimination"
"based on or due to such immutable and acquired characteristics, which do"
"not on their own make human being unequal. It is now well accepted that,"
"the ‘right to equality’ covers a much wider area, aimed at preventing other"
"‘injustices’  too,  that  are  recognized  by  law.  Equality  is  now  a  right  as"
"opposed to a mere privileged or entitlement, and in the context of Sri Lanka"
"a ‘Fundamental Right’, conferred on the people by the Constitution, for the"
"purpose 
of 
curing  not 
only 
injustices 
taking 
the  manifestation 
of"
"discrimination,  but  a  host  of  maladies 
recognized  by 
law.  While  all"
"Fundamental  Rights  are  of  equal 
importance  and  value, 
the 
‘right 
to"
"equality’. The ability of human beings to live in contemporary societies (as"
"opposed  to  merely  existing),  and  develop  and  reap  the  fruits  of  social,"
"scientific, economic and political developments, is based on their ability to"
"exercise fully the ‘right to equality’. Similarly, for human civilizations may"
"they be national or international to reap the full benefits of knowledge, skills,"
"experience, 
talents  and  wisdom 
that  people  possess,  people  of  such"
"societies must enjoy the ‘right to equality’”."
