"Under the circumstances, I find it necessary to consider whether the petitioners"
"can be considered as police officers who fall within the 2nd group as determined"
"by the Cabinet of Ministers, which has recommended that the police officers who"
"received  injuries  due  to  L.T.T.E  terrorist  activities  until  18-05-2014  and  had"
"received promotion of service thereafter, should have their promotions backdated"
"to the date of injury they sustained."
"The document marked P-1 produced by the petitioners establishes the fact that"
"the petitioners hold different ranks in Sri Lanka police service and were serving"
"police  officers  at  the  time  they  filed  this  petition  before  the  Court  and  were"
"attached to different police stations in the country. The documents marked and"
"produced  along  with  the  petition  marked  P2A  to  P2T  sets  out  their  letters  of"
"appointment as police officers and the ranks they held before they received their"
"injuries in the line of duty."
"The documents marked P3A to P3T shows the medical assessments in relation"
"to the petitioners after they sustained their respective injuries. The documents"
"marked P4A to P4T establish the fact that subsequent to their injuries, that they"
"have earned promotions within the service."
"I find that the 1st respondent being the Inspector General of Police had admitted"
"the above in the limited objections he filed before the Court."
"The specific averment in the petition that a senior police officer who sustained"
"injuries under similar circumstances earned a promotion thereafter, and had his"
"promotion backdated to his date of injury had not been disputed either."
"It is my considered view that the Cabinet of Ministers, when deciding to act under"
"the Cabinet Memorandum of the Subject Minister dated 26-03-2015, have not"
"intended to create a distinction between the officers who received a promotion"
"while in service and retired before 18-05-2014, and those who were still in service"
"at  that  time  after  receiving  a  promotion,  when  recommending  the  relief  under"
"the 2nd head of the Cabinet Memorandum."
