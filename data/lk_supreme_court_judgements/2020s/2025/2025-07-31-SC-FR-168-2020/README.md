Decided on : 31-07-2025

Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application filed by the petitioners on 16-06-2020, alleging that the

fundamental rights guaranteed to them in terms of Article 12(1) and/or Article

14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been infringed and/or continued to be infringed

by the actions or inactions of any one or more of the respondents named, and

seeking redress as sought for in the petition.

When this matter was supported for Leave to Proceed on 23-02-2022, this Court,

having considered the relevant facts and the circumstances, as well as the

relevant law, decided to grant Leave to Proceed on the alleged infringement of

Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The said Article of the Constitution which defines the right to equality reads as

follows;

12(1). All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal

protection of the law.

At the hearing of this application, this Court heard the submissions of the

learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioners, and that of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General (DSG) for the respondents. This Court also had the benefit of

considering the written submissions tendered in determining this application.

Page 11 of 27

The facts that led to this application can be summarized in the following manner.

At the time this application was filed before this Court, all the petitioners were

serving police officers of the Sri Lanka police who held different ranks, although

some may have retired from the service by now.

The petitioners belong to a group of police officers who had been injured resulting

from terrorist activities on different occasions, while being engaged in their

official duties, and continued to be in police service after their recovery. These

are police officers who had earned at least one promotion after they sustained

the said injuries.

Having considered the necessity to grant special relief to those police officers who

had received injuries due to terrorist activities, the then relevant Cabinet

Minister has presented the Cabinet Memorandum No. 10/2015 dated 26-03-

2015 to the Cabinet of Ministers proposing granting of relief. While classifying

them under three categories, [document marked P5(a)] the Minister had sought

Cabinet approval for the implementation of the said proposal.

For the better understanding of the scheme of relief, I will now reproduce the

said recommendations in its full, which reads as follows.

1. .... 2014.05.18

2014.05.18

/ ( )

348 . (...)

Page 12 of 27

4. 2009.05.18 ,

5. 2009.05.18

,

.

The petitioners position is that they fall into to the 2nd group of police officers as

detailed in the petition.

The document marked P5(b), which is the relevant Cabinet Decision in relation

to the above-mentioned Cabinet Memorandum, shows that the Cabinet of

Ministers have decided on 23-05-2017 to approve the said Cabinet

Memorandum, and the Secretary to the Cabinet has written to the relevant

authorities who are vested with the responsibility of implementing the said

Cabinet Decision, requiring them to implement the same.

The relevant part of the said directive reads as follows;

(i) 2015-03-

26 (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) ;

(ii) (i)

.

The petitioners have marked and produced as P6, P6(a), P7, P8, P9, several

communications that took place between the respondents named in the petition

in relation to the implementation of the said Cabinet Decision.

According to the averments of paragraph 15 of the petition, the petitioners have

come to know that, at least one senior police officer who belong to the same

category of officers as the petitioners, and who was also entitled to relief, had

been granted relief in accordance with the Cabinet Decision, and the promotion

he earned subsequent to his injuries had been backdated to the date of his

Page 13 of 27

injury, namely to 27-05-2000. A copy of the letter written by the Secretary of

National Police Commission to the Secretary of the Public Administration,

Management, and Law and Order Ministry in that regard has been submitted

marked as P10(b) to establish that fact.

The petitioners have also written several letters and have made several

representations to the relevant authorities requesting them to grant the reliefs

approved by the Cabinet.

It has been submitted further that, by Common Order No. 42/2019 dated 22-

01-2019, 340 police officers have also been granted relief in accordance with the

said Cabinet Decision (document marked P18). By RTM 561 dated 18-03-2019,

further 106 police officers have been granted relief (document marked P19), and

by RTM 562 dated 18-03-2019, 438 police officers have been granted relief

(document marked P20).

Despite reliefs being granted to number of other police officers who fall within

the other categories of officers referred in the Cabinet Decision, as well as to at

least one senior police officer who was eligible under the same category of police

officers as the petitioners, it has been their contention that they have not been

granted their entitlement as to the said Cabinet Decision thus far, which

amounts to a violation of their fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.

When this matter was considered for granting of leave, the 1st respondent

originally mentioned in the petition, namely, the then Inspector General of Police,

filing limited objections to the granting of leave, has not disputed the fact that

the petitioners were police officers who received injuries during the separatist

conflict while being engaged in their official duties, and were serving police

officers at the time of filing this application. The fact that they have earned and

received promotions as mentioned in their petition had also not been disputed.

The 1st respondent has not disputed the Cabinet Memorandum marked P5(a),

and the Cabinet Decision in that regard marked P5(b). However, he had taken

Page 14 of 27

up the position that the police officers qualified under the said Cabinet Decision

have already been granted benefits thereon.

Apart from the other documents marked along with these objections, the 1st

respondent has marked another Cabinet Decision apparently taken on 26-01-

2021, which was after the institution of this action, and has stated that steps

have been taken to grant relief as per the said new Cabinet Decision, and if the

petitioners are qualified under the same, they will receive their benefits as

claimed.

On the basis that the petitioners application is misconceived in law, vexatious

and futile, and the petitioners have failed to establish that their fundamental

rights have been violated, it has been prayed that the application should stand

dismissed. It has also been claimed that the petitioners application is of out of

time, and that the petitioners have failed to name the relevant parties as

respondents of the application.

At the hearing of this application, the learned Presidents Counsel, for the

petitioners was of the view that the legal objections taken up by the learned DSG

as to the maintainability of the application before the Court cannot be sustained.

He pointed out that the petitioners have come before the Court not to challenge

the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers, but to challenge the continuing failure

by the relevant authorities to grant relief as per the said Cabinet Decision, which

amounts to clear discrimination, denying them the right to equality and equal

protection of the law. Hence, it was his position that making the Cabinet of

Ministers a party to this application would not arise. It was submitted that the

petitioners have come before the Court well within the time limit permitted by

law on the basis of continuing violation of their fundamental rights.

Submitting as to the facts, it was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel,

that the petitioners have clearly demonstrated before the Court that they are

entitled to receive benefits in terms of the 2nd recommendation in the relevant

Cabinet Decision, and at least one senior officer of the police department who

Page 15 of 27

fell within the same category has been given relief, which amounts to treating

the petitioners differently. He also pointed out that the other officers who became

entitled to relief under the other categories mentioned in the said Cabinet Paper

have also been granted relief as admitted by the respondents, and leaving the

petitioners out from granting relief amounts to a clear discrimination.

The learned DSG who represented the Hon. Attorney General and the other

respondents, submitted two legal arguments on the basis that the petitioners

have no locus standi to maintain this application. It was submitted that the

petition has been filed beyond the one-month period of the alleged infringement,

and the Cabinet of Ministers should have been made parties to the action as it

was the decision of the Cabinet that had been challenged. Making submissions

as to the facts, it was her stand that the recommendation 1 and 2 of the

contentious Cabinet Decision could only be applicable to those officers who

retired prior to 18-05-2014 and not to the petitioners who were serving police

officers. It was contended that the petitioners, if at all, stand entitle to receive

benefits only in terms of the 3rd category of officers mentioned in the Cabinet

Decision, which makes them entitled to two special salary increments only.

It was stated that all the petitioners have already been granted two salary

increments pursuant to P5(a) and P5(b), and therefore, they are attempting to

misinterpret the said Cabinet Decision though they have already received their

entitlement.

Having scrutinized the petition before the Court, the relevant supporting

documents filed, the objections raised as to the maintainability of this

application, and the oral and written submissions, I will now proceed to consider

whether petitioners are entitled to the reliefs as sought, or whether the

fundamental rights application should stand dismissed as contented on behalf

of the respondents.

Page 16 of 27

I find that what the learned DSG had submitted in her written submissions, that

the contention of the petitioners in relation to this petition had been that they

also qualify to receive a further promotion, and to have it backdated as stipulated

under the 2nd recommendation of the Cabinet Decision, was not correct,

whereas, their contention had been to the effect that they are entitled to have

the promotions they have already earned after sustaining respective injuries and

while being in service backdated to the date of the injury they sustained while

being engaged in their official duty.

Having observed as such, I will now consider the legal objections raised to the

effect that the relevant parties have not been named in the petition and that the

application was out of time, before moving on to the facts of the matter, if

necessary.

It is abundantly clear that the petitioners have come before the Court not to

challenge the Cabinet Memorandum dated 26-03-2015 or the Cabinet Decision

taken in that regard on 23-05-2017. They have come before this Court on the

basis that the subsequent actions of the respondents, where they have been

deprived of their entitlements, amounts to violation of their fundamental rights.

Therefore, it is my view that it was not necessary for the petitioners to name the

Cabinet of Ministers as a party to this action.

A person who alleges that his fundamental rights or language rights have been

infringed or is about to be infringed by executive or administrative action needs

to come before the Supreme Court within one month thereof in terms of Article

126(2) of the Constitution.

As I have considered earlier, the petitioners have not come before the Court in

order to challenge the Cabinet Decision taken on 23-05-2017. It is very much

clear that with the directive by the Secretary to the Cabinet, to the relevant

authorities to implement the Cabinet Decision, in fact, the relevant authorities

which include the respondents mentioned have taken steps to implement the

same, and had partly implemented the said decision in a phased-out manner.

Page 17 of 27

This goes on to establish that the petitioners had clear legitimate expectations

that they will also be granted relief in the similar manner. It was only after it

became clear to the petitioners that they will not be granted the reliefs as

approved by the Cabinet, but they will be considered on a different basis to that

of the Cabinet Decision, they have come before the Court seeking relief. Hence,

I am of the view that there exists no basis to consider that their application to

Court was time barred in terms of the Article 126(2) of the Constitution. It is my

considered view that the alleged infringement amounts to continuing violation of

fundamental rights under that context.

In the case of SC(FR) Application No. 542/2009 decided on 20-01-2021:

Per Priyantha Jayawardena, PC, J.,

Article 126(2) of the Constitution states that an application for infringement

or imminent infringement of Fundamental Rights can be filed within one

month thereof in the Supreme Court.

The word within used in the said Article requires the period of one month

to be calculated from the date of the alleged infringement, imminent

infringement, or from the date on which the petitioner became aware of the

alleged infringement, if knowledge on the part of the petitioner is required to

establish the alleged infringement.

This question was also discussed in the case of Gamaethige Vs. Siriwardena

(1988] 1 Sri L.R. 385.

Per Fernando, J.,

Three principles are discernible in regard to the operation of the time limit

prescribed by Article 126(2). Time begins to run when the infringement takes

place; if knowledge on the part of the petitioner is required (e.g of other

instances by comparison with which the treatment meted out to him

becomes discriminatory), time begins to run only when both infringement

and knowledge exist.

Page 18 of 27

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the two legal objections

taken up by the learned DSG as to the maintainability of this application lacks

merit.

Moving on to the facts, since the Leave to Proceed was granted only on the alleged

violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution, I will limit my consideration to ascertain whether equality and the

equal protection entitled to all persons before the law have been infringed.

In Wijerathna Vs. Sri Lanka Ports Authority, SC/FR/256/17 SCM

11.12.2020, Kodagoda, J. held:

The concept of equality was originally aimed at preventing discrimination

based on or due to such immutable and acquired characteristics, which do

not on their own make human being unequal. It is now well accepted that,

the right to equality covers a much wider area, aimed at preventing other

injustices too, that are recognized by law. Equality is now a right as

opposed to a mere privileged or entitlement, and in the context of Sri Lanka

a Fundamental Right, conferred on the people by the Constitution, for the

purpose of curing not only injustices taking the manifestation of

discrimination, but a host of maladies recognized by law. While all

Fundamental Rights are of equal importance and value, the right to

equality. The ability of human beings to live in contemporary societies (as

opposed to merely existing), and develop and reap the fruits of social,

scientific, economic and political developments, is based on their ability to

exercise fully the right to equality. Similarly, for human civilizations may

they be national or international to reap the full benefits of knowledge, skills,

experience, talents and wisdom that people possess, people of such

societies must enjoy the right to equality.

Page 19 of 27

In the case of M. Ashroff Rumy and Another Vs. Hon. Thalatha Athukorale,

Minister of Justice & Prison Reforms, Ministry of Justice, SC/FR/

230/2018, Jayantha Jayasuriya, P.C., C.J. held:

All persons should be treated equally. Therefore, setting out different

criteria based on the area of service per se could lead to unequal treatment

unless such differentia is based on justifiable objective criteria on valid

reasons and one such criteria could be the competency in a particular

language depending on the area of service. The Supreme Court in fact had

accepted that classifications are allowed if they are not arbitrary and

founded upon intelligible differentia. Ananda Dharmadasa and Others v

Ariyaratne Hewage and Others ([2008] 2 SLR 19, Tuan Ishan Raban and

Others v Members of the Police Commission ([2007] 2 SLR 351. The objective

of this requirement is to treat equals equally and not unequally.

When it comes to the facts that led to this application, the respondents have not

disputed at any time, the existence of the Cabinet Memorandum marked P5(a)

and the subsequent Cabinet Decision dated 23-05-2017 marked P5(b). When

reading the Cabinet Memorandum and the Cabinet Decision, it is clear that the

Cabinet of Ministers have approved the Memorandum submitted by the Minister,

to consider the police officers who come within the purview of the said

recommendations under three categories. The letter issued by the Secretary to

the Cabinet informing the relevant officials to implement the decision, which I

have reproduced earlier, amply demonstrates that fact. I find that the said

Cabinet Decision had never been rescinded by the Cabinet of Ministers at any

time and very much in force. I find that all other Cabinet Decisions taken

subsequently on the same subject have also been made based on the said

original Cabinet Decision.

Page 20 of 27

Under the circumstances, I find it necessary to consider whether the petitioners

can be considered as police officers who fall within the 2nd group as determined

by the Cabinet of Ministers, which has recommended that the police officers who

received injuries due to L.T.T.E terrorist activities until 18-05-2014 and had

received promotion of service thereafter, should have their promotions backdated

to the date of injury they sustained.

The document marked P-1 produced by the petitioners establishes the fact that

the petitioners hold different ranks in Sri Lanka police service and were serving

police officers at the time they filed this petition before the Court and were

attached to different police stations in the country. The documents marked and

produced along with the petition marked P2A to P2T sets out their letters of

appointment as police officers and the ranks they held before they received their

injuries in the line of duty.

The documents marked P3A to P3T shows the medical assessments in relation

to the petitioners after they sustained their respective injuries. The documents

marked P4A to P4T establish the fact that subsequent to their injuries, that they

have earned promotions within the service.

I find that the 1st respondent being the Inspector General of Police had admitted

the above in the limited objections he filed before the Court.

The specific averment in the petition that a senior police officer who sustained

injuries under similar circumstances earned a promotion thereafter, and had his

promotion backdated to his date of injury had not been disputed either.

It is my considered view that the Cabinet of Ministers, when deciding to act under

the Cabinet Memorandum of the Subject Minister dated 26-03-2015, have not

intended to create a distinction between the officers who received a promotion

while in service and retired before 18-05-2014, and those who were still in service

at that time after receiving a promotion, when recommending the relief under

the 2nd head of the Cabinet Memorandum.

Page 21 of 27

It appears that the learned DSG had heavily relied on the Cabinet Memorandum

dated 05-08-2019 and the subsequent Cabinet Decision dated 10-09-2019

(documents marked 1R4 and 1R5) to argue that the petitioners, since they are

serving police officers, are only entitled to receive two salary increments

according to the Cabinet Decision, and the said relief has been granted to them,

and also that since there is a new Cabinet Decision in this regard, the said

decision, namely, 1R5, should be the decision that would be now applicable to

the petitioners.

It needs to be emphasized that what is considered here would be whether the

fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution have been infringed due

to the continuing non-implementation of the Cabinet decision dated 23-05-2017

and not the cabinet decisions reached thereafter.

It is very much clear to me even from the Cabinet Decision relied on by the

learned DSG, that the Cabinet has never intended to rescind the previous

Cabinet Decision under which the petitioners have sought relief from this Court.

In fact, the intention and the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers had been to

extend the reliefs granted by the Cabinet of Ministers on 23-05-2017 to a further

group of police officers who have attained the retirement age or gone on

retirement from 18-05-2014 up until 31-07-2019.

It appears that the subsequent Cabinet Memorandum has been presented in a

manner to show that the previous Cabinet Decision relates to two groups of

police officers only by including the 2nd group of police officers mentioned in the

previous Cabinet Decision under the 1st group, to make it look like the previous

Cabinet Decision relates to only two groups of police officers, although it has

specifically referred to the previous Cabinet Decision.

The relevant part of the said subsequent Cabinet Memorandum reads as follows.

However, the proposal submitted in the said Memorandum too clearly shows

that the police officers who falls under the 2nd category of officers in terms of the

original Cabinet Decision applicable to the petitioners, would get the benefits

similar to the earlier Cabinet Decision if they had retired on or before 31-07-

2019, by getting their promotions earned while in service backdated to the date

where they sustained their injuries.

The said proposal which has later been approved by the Cabinet reads as follows.

, (this is very much similar to the 1st proposal

in the Cabinet Decision dated 23-05-2017, the only difference being that

the said relief has been extended to a period up to 31-07-2019)

In my view, this Cabinet Decision will again leave out some of the petitioners,

some of them who may have retired by now, which amounts to treating them

differently to those who benefitted by the Cabinet Decision dated 25-03-2017.

I do not find an acceptable basis for the argument advanced by the learned DSG

that the petitioners should fall under the 3rd category of police officers mentioned

in the Cabinet Decision dated 26-05-2015. In my view, the 3rd category of police

officers are the police officers who have not received any promotion up until the

date of the said Cabinet Decision and who have been assigned to perform light

duties due to the level of injuries they have sustained, and not the petitioners

who had received promotions but still in the active service.

I am of the view that the respondents cannot move away from their obligations

by granting the petitioners only two salary increments, as that was not the

Page 24 of 27

intention of the Cabinet of Ministers when they reached the relevant Cabinet

Decision on 23-05-2017.

I find that the relevant Cabinet Decision applicable to the petitioners has been

reached clearly on the consideration of the police officers under three categories,

namely;

(a) who were retired by that time without having earned a promotion;

(b) the police officers who have earned a promotion after their injury

irrespective of the fact whether they are still serving police officers or

not;

(c) and those police officers who were still serving at the time of the

original Cabinet Decision but performing light duties, and have not

earned any promotion since their date of the injury;

It needs to be noted further, in the correspondence the respondents have had

within the Police Department and with other relevant authorities, copies of which

had been marked along with the petition, it had never been suggested that the

relevant Cabinet Decision has grouped the relevant police officers under two

categories as argued during the hearing of this matter on behalf of the

respondents, but under three categories as in the said Cabinet Decision.

It seems to me that arguing this matter based on a Cabinet Decision taken on

10-09-2019 would not have arisen if the relevant authorities had acted promptly

by giving effect to the Cabinet Decision reached on 23-05-2017. If that had

happened as it should have, the petitioners ought to have been granted the reliefs

long before the Cabinet Decision relied on by the learned DSG, which makes

considering the issue based on a subsequent decision irrelevant.

The fundamental rights jurisdiction has been well evolved in a manner that even

if a single person belonging to one category of persons who falls within that

category has been treated differently, such a treatment amounts to the violation

of the fundamental rights of the other members of the same category of persons.

In the case of Perera Vs. Jayawickrema (1985) 1 Sri L.R. 285, Sharvananda,

C.J. (with Ranasinghe J., Abdul Carder J., Atukorale J., Tambiah J, and De

Alwis J. agreeing) delivered the majority opinion of the Court. The Chief Justice

stated that a person claiming to be discriminated against must show that there

was at least one other person similarly situated or equally circumstanced; that

he had been treated differently from others and that there was no reasonable

basis for such differential treatment, Discrimination can exist only where two

persons or two subjects are treated in different ways. It arises only from two

dissimilar treatments and not from similar treatments.

As per C.W. Mackie and Co. Ltd Vs. Hugh Molagoda, Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue and Others (1986) 1 Sri L.R. 301;

In order to sustain the plea of discrimination based upon Article 12(1) a

party will have to satisfy the Court about two things, (1) that he has been

treated differently from others, (2) that he has been differently treated from

persons similarly circumstanced without any reasonable basis.

In the case of Rienzie Perera and Another Vs. University Grants Commission

(1978-79-80) 1 SLR 128;

Per Sharvananda, J.,

A person relying on a plea of unlawful discrimination must set out with

sufficient particulars his plea showing how, between persons similarly

circumstanced, discrimination has been made, which discrimination is

founded on no intelligible differentia. If the petitioner establishes similarity

between persons who are subjected to differential treatment, it is for the

State to establish that the differentia is based on a rational object sought to

be achieved by it. But where similarity is not shown, the plea as to

infringement of Article 12 must fail.

To make out a case of denial of the equal protection, a plea of differential

treatment is by itself not sufficient. The petitioner, pleading that Article 14

Page 26 of 27

has been violated, must make out that not only had he been treated

differently from others, but that he has been so treated from persons

similarly circumstanced without any reasonable basis and such differential

treatment is unjustifiable.- Probhudas Morarjee Vs. Union of India

(1966) S.C. 1044. (The Article 14 considered here is the corresponding

Article to Article 12 of our Constitution)

As mentioned previously, it is clear that one senior police officer, who belonged

to the same category of police officers as the petitioners and was entitled to relief,

had been granted the said relief, and his subsequent promotion has been

backdated to the date of his injury, thereby treating the petitioners differently,

although all of them were similarly circumstanced.

For the above reasons as considered, I am of the view that the fundamental rights

of the petitioners guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) had been infringed by

treating them differently and in contrary to the relevant Cabinet Decision, which

has resulted in their fundamental rights continued to be infringed.

Therefore, I hold that the petitioners are entitled for relief for the infringement of

their fundamental rights.

Accordingly, I direct the 1B respondent or whoever the person holding the post

of the Inspector General of Police, The National Police Commission, namely 2B,

3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7A, and 8A respondents, and also 13D respondent, the Secretary

of Ministry of Public Security, to take immediate meaningful steps to backdate

the 1st promotion earned by the petitioners while serving in the Police

Department as police officers of various ranks after they received injuries due

to the L.T.T.E. terrorist activities, to the date of them sustaining their respective

injuries.

The respondents shall liaise with other relevant authorities and take necessary

steps to grant the said relief within a period of four months from the date of this

judgment.

Having considered the relevant facts, circumstances and the facts relating to the

nature of the infringement of the petitioners fundamental rights, I do not think

that this is a proper instance where compensation should be ordered.

However, I direct the State shall pay a cost of Rs. 100,000/- to the petitioners as

the costs of this application.
