Argued on: 12.03.2025

Decided on: 16.10.2025 Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner was a lady Sub-Inspector of the Sri Lanka Police and residing in Baddegama

during the time she filed the instant Application. She alleges that while working at the

Boosa Detention Unit of the Terrorist Investigation Department (TID), the 1st Respondent

repeatedly made inappropriate advances and indecent suggestions toward her in person,

Page 3 of 8

which she rejected. The Petitioner further claims that the 1st Respondent made lewd

remarks over the phone, explicitly expressing a desire for sexual relations with her and

intimidating her by warning her against reporting these incidents to superior officers.

Anyhow, she reported the 1st Respondent’s alleged behaviour to the 2nd Respondent, who

dismissed her complaint. The other segment of the Petitioner’s complaint is the delay in

accommodating her request for a transfer due to her pregnancy. She states that she had to

commute over 100 km daily, spending more than eight hours travelling, which led to a

miscarriage of her four-and-a-half-month-old foetus. As a result, she claims that she

suffered severe mental trauma and distress.

The Petitioner asserts that the Respondents violated her fundamental rights under Article

12(1) of the Constitution by failing to investigate the 1st Respondent for sexual harassment,

despite her rejection of his advances. Instead, they initiated an inquiry against her based

on a complaint by the 1st Respondent, resulting in a punitive black mark on her record.

Furthermore, the Petitioner to justify her alleged infringement of fundamental rights

asserts that the Respondents arbitrarily delayed her transfer; failed to release her from the

TID to a suitable division to accommodate her pregnancy; and only transferred her as

requested after she suffered a miscarriage, thereby infringing her fundamental rights.

Regardless of the multiple claims raised by the Petitioner in the instant Application, this

Court granted Leave to Proceed on 10.01.2017 for the alleged violations of the Petitioner’s

fundamental rights under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g), in respect of the Petitioner’s transfer.

Summary of the Facts Narrated by the Petitioner

In the Petition filed on 13.10.2016, the Petitioner alleges that while working at the Boosa

Detention Unit of the TID, the 1st Respondent repeatedly made inappropriate suggestions

and advances toward her. According to the Petitioner, when she rebuffed his persistent

advances by mentioning her marital status, he grew angry, threatened her with the words,

“I will see about you,” and cautioned that complaining to senior officers would be futile as

they would not believe her. The Petitioner further complains of an incident on 06.06.2016,

after which the 1st Respondent falsely recorded in the administration unit that she had

scolded him and insulted his rank. Consequently, the Petitioner also lodged a complaint

in the Information Book.

Page 4 of 8

The Petitioner reported these incidents and the conduct of the 1st Respondent to the former

Officer in Charge of Boosa Unit of TID, the 2nd Respondent, and the 3rd Respondent. She

asserts that the 2nd Respondent did not entertain her complaint. Subsequently, she was

transferred to Vavuniya, but following an appeal to the Department of Grievances, this

transfer was revoked. As a result, the Petitioner reported to TID Headquarters, Colombo

on 30.06.2016. She states that after her posting to Colombo, the lack of suitable barracks

for pregnant women required her to travel over 100 km daily, spending more than eight

hours commuting. She states that she was also assigned physically strenuous tasks, such

as climbing multiple flights of stairs when the elevator was out of service. Consequently,

on 01.07.2016 the Petitioner requested a transfer to Galle or Elpitiya, but by letter dated

05.07.2016 the DIG refused her request, citing a pending inquiry against her.

It seems that the inquiry against the Petitioner concerns a verbal altercation between her

and the 1st Respondent. An inquiry was conducted based on the Charge Sheet issued

against the Petitioner, and a portion of the proceedings of such inquiry is marked as ‘X11’

and ‘X12’. The Petitioner argues that the Respondents acted arbitrarily and capriciously

by neglecting to investigate the 1st Respondent’s alleged sexual harassment and by

hindering her transfer through their failure to reassign her from the TID to an appropriate

division.

The Petitioner states that she preferred an appeal to the Director of TID and the 2nd

Respondent on 01.07.2016, along with a completed 51A form, requesting a transfer from

the TID to a Police station in Galle or Elpitiya. She explains that the journey by bus and

train was extremely taxing, yet she persisted to avoid jeopardising her job. According to

the Petitioner, she had a miscarriage and lost her four-and-a-half-month-old foetus on

13.09.2016. The Petitioner states that owing to the aforesaid loss, her mental trauma and

agony were aggravated, and she suffers from the same to the present day. The contention

of the Petitioner is that the Respondents’ inaction, along with their actions against her,

including her subsequent transfers, were motivated by improper intentions related to her

rejection of the 1st Respondent’s sexual advances.

The Petitioner asserts that the actions of the Respondents outlined in her Petition were

directed against her solely because she is a female police officer, thereby violating her rights

under Article 12(2) of the Constitution. She further contends that the Police Department

lacks specific provisions, whether through law, subordinate legislation, or executive

Page 5 of 8

action, to promote the advancement of women, as provided for under Article 12(4).

Additionally, she claims that her fundamental rights under Article 14(1)(g), which ensure

her freedom to engage in any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business, or enterprise

without obstruction, have been infringed.

Statements of Objection of the Respondents

The 1st and 2nd Respondents have submitted separate affidavits. The 1st Respondent,

denying the Petitioner's allegations, states that she was transferred to the TID on

14.07.2010, then to the Boosa unit of TID on 10.01.2011, and later to Colombo on

01.07.2016. He notes that he was appointed as Acting Officer in Charge of the Boosa TID

unit on 01.01.2016, and had been serving there for approximately six months. In his

affidavit, the 1st Respondent affirms that on 06.06.2016, the Petitioner spoke to him

disrespectfully in the presence of two junior officers in the same unit, as recorded in the

routine information book entry marked 1R1. The said incident prompted him to file a

complaint against the Petitioner with the 3rd Respondent. He maintains that he did not

violate the Petitioner’s fundamental rights and performed his duties lawfully and justly

throughout the relevant period.

In his affidavit, the 2nd Respondent states that the Petitioner was transferred to the

Vavuniya Unit of the TID, the only other TID unit with female officers, making it the

most appropriate assignment during the preliminary inquiry conducted by the Colombo

TID Headquarters. The Petitioner reportedly failed to report for duty at the TID unit in

Vavuniya. Instead, she worked at the Colombo TID Headquarters from 01.07.2016 to

04.07.2016, before taking multiple days of leave. The 2nd Respondent notes that several

pregnant female officers travel from various parts of the country to work at the Colombo

TID Headquarters, a six-story building equipped with two 24-hour elevators. He also

points out that, despite the Petitioner’s complaints about travelling over 100 km daily, she

attended lectures at the Negombo/Katana Police Academy every Saturday from 8:00 AM

to 5:15 PM, during the relevant period. The 2nd Respondent claims that the Petitioner did

not report any harassment by the 1st Respondent to him at the time of the transfer.

Additionally, he mentions that pregnant female officers are allowed to report to work one

hour early and leave one hour late, and they are transferred to a police station closer to

their residence two months before giving birth, remaining there for one year afterwards.

The learned Additional Solicitor General (‘ASG’) submitted that the preliminary inquiry,

concluded on 15.08.2016, recommended that the Petitioner be served with a charge sheet.

However, the 2nd Respondent, acting on sympathetic grounds, issued only a ‘black mark’

against her, which could be expunged based on future satisfactory conduct. The ASG

argued that the Petitioner’s transfer from the TID was not due to any fault of the

Respondents and that she was consistently protected under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution, meaning her fundamental rights were not violated by the Respondents’

actions concerning the transfer.

Alleged Violation of Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution

I am mindful that this Court needs to examine the alleged violations of the Petitioner’s

fundamental rights under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) upon which Leave to Proceed was

granted, specifically concerning the Petitioner’s transfer. Even to consider whether the

alleged lewd remarks made by the 1st Respondent have a direct or implied link to the

actions taken by the authorities in reference to the transfer of the Petitioner, such remarks

or allegations must be substantiated against the 1st Respondent with sufficient evidence.

The Petitioner places reliance on the judgment of P. S. Manohari Pelaketiya v H. M.

Gunasekera and Others (SC FR 76/2012, SC Minutes of 28.09.2016) in which the Supreme

Court has decided that sexual harassment or workplace stress and strain occasioned by

oppressive and burdensome conduct under colour of executive office would be an

infringement of the fundamental rights of the petitioner of the said case. The learned ASG

distinguishes the facts of the above case and submits that the Petitioner in the said

Pelaketiya v Gunasekara case has successfully proved the sexual harassment suffered by

her, whereas the Petitioner of the instant case has failed to establish such allegations.

Nevertheless, given the unique circumstances of this case and the way it has been

presented before this Court, I take the view that I am not mandated to examine any

infringement of fundamental rights of the Petitioner considering the alleged grounds of not

holding an inquiry against the 1st Respondent, upon the lewd remarks allegedly made by

him.

Public officers often approach the Court through fundamental rights applications,

claiming that their transfers were arbitrary, unreasonable, or driven by political motives.

The Supreme Court has consistently stepped in when such transfers are deemed an abuse

Page 7 of 8

of authority or a form of punishment. In terms of the Departmental Order No. A.11 (‘2R3’)

of Sri Lanka Police, the officers are not entitled to transfer as a matter of right. The said

document ‘2R3’ stipulates ‘privilege transfers’ and ‘transfers on health grounds’. In terms

of Part IV(1) of the said ‘2R3’, an officer wanting a transfer of health grounds may apply

on Police Form 51, attaching a medical certificate from a medical officer. Such medical

certificates should indicate reasons for recommending the transfer, specifically stating

climate, etc.

It should be noted that the authorities eventually approved the Petitioner’s requested

transfer on 01.07.2016, allowing her to serve at the Baddegama Police Station in the

Elpitiya Division. As previously stated, the Petitioner had applied for this transfer using

Form 51A, which is based on health grounds and not on any other reasons adduced in the

Petition and the affidavit of the Petitioner. The letter dated 04.07.2016 from the Acting

Director of the TID to the Deputy Inspector General of Police TID (marked ‘X5’)

recommended the Petitioner’s transfer. However, the Transfer Order was issued only on

06.09.2016 (marked ‘X16’), which was within 2 months and 6 days from the request of the

Petitioner. The Respondents attributed the delay to the provisions in Part I(8) of the said

Departmental Order, which prohibits transferring a police officer between

Provinces/Divisions while serious charges are pending. The Acting Deputy Inspector

General of Police of TID recorded an entry to this effect (marked ‘X6’). The reason

asserted by the Respondents as an excuse for the delay in concluding the disciplinary

inquiry against the Petitioner, was the Petitioner’s extended absence from work on leave,

as they were unable to record her statement until 08.08.2016.

I must now focus on a letter dated 28.09.2016, signed by the Petitioner (found on pages

46 to 54, starting from page 54, of the appeal brief). In this letter, on page 7, the Petitioner

explicitly states that she first learned of her pregnancy on 27.06.2016. She provided copies

of two letters from a specialist Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, marked ‘X2’ (dated

26.06.2016 and 10.07.2016), which advise her to avoid long-distance travel and strenuous

activities. These letters, issued under the heading “To whom it may concern,” contain

largely similar content and they are not accompanied with a diagnosis card. However, the

said Gynaecologist did not provide specific reasons for these recommendations. Based on

extensive reading, I have noted that a Gynaecologist should be able to identify causes of

imminent miscarriage through proper examination, however, the letters marked ‘X2’ and

Page 8 of 8

‘X17’, issued by the same Gynaecologist, provide no substantive reasons or clinical

findings. Moreover, the Petitioner’s final medical document (‘X13’) has not been issued

by the said Gynaecologist, but by the Teaching Hospital, Galle. Therefore, a reasonable

doubt arises whether such documents were prepared solely to favour her.

Thus, I am not convinced by the arguments raised by the Petitioner that revolve around

the letters of the said Gynaecologist. Likewise, I am unable to draw a substantial

connection between the alleged delay in approving the Petitioner’s requested transfer and

her pregnancy, which she learned about on 27.06.2016.

Based on the above, I find that the Petitioner has not provided sufficient evidence to meet

the burden of proof required to establish a violation of fundamental rights under Article

12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution concerning her requested transfer.

Additionally, the Petitioner has not presented convincing evidence to show that the

purported delay (from 01.07.2016 to 06.09.2016) in issuing the Transfer Order was

arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Therefore, I am not persuaded that the

Respondents' actions in respect of the request for a transfer by the Petitioner infringed her

fundamental rights under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g). Hence, I dismiss the instant

Application without costs.
