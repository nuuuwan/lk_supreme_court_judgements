"However, the 18th  Amendment to the Constitution repealed Article 155G and also"
"repealed the existing Article 55, replacing it with a revised provision. Consequently,"
"the   powers   over   all   matters   of  policy  related   to   public   officers,   including   those"
"concerning appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control, and dismissal,"
"were   reverted   to   the   Cabinet   of   Ministers.5  Additionally,   the
 appointments,"
"promotions,
 
transfers,
  disciplinary   control,
  and   dismissal
 of   all
  Heads   of"
"Departments were also entrusted to the Cabinet of Ministers.6Furthermore, subject to"
"the   provisions   of   the   Constitution,   the   powers   related   to   the
 appointments,"
"promotions,   transfers,   disciplinary   control,   and   dismissal  of   public   officers   were"
"granted to the Public Service Commission.7  As a result, police officers were also"
"classified under the category of public officers."
"In the 18th Amendment, the Legislature removed the words ""subject to the provisions"
"of   the   Constitution"" 
that   were   there   in   Article   55(4)   introduced   by   the   17th"
"Amendment. However, it retained the power of the Cabinet of Ministers to determine"
"""all   matters   of
 policy 
relating   to   public   officers,   including  policy 
relating   to"
"appointments,
 promotions,   transfers,   disciplinary   control,   and   dismissal""   in   the"
"corresponding amended Article 55(1)."
"The resulting position is that the Cabinet of Ministers were vested with the power to"
"provide   for   and   recommend   all   the   matters   of  policy  relating   to   public   officers"
"without   the   limitation   of   being   “subject   to   the   provisions   of   the   Constitution”."
"However, it is easily perceived that in a constitutional structure, no functionary of the"
"state or public authority has an absolute or unfettered discretion. The very idea of"
"unfettered discretion is totally incompatible with the doctrine of equality enshrined in"
"the Constitution and it is also against the rule of law. It is presumed that even the"
"discretionary powers conferred on executive in absolute and unfettered terms will"
"necessarily   and   obviously   be   exercised   reasonably   and   for   the   betterment   of   the"
"public."
