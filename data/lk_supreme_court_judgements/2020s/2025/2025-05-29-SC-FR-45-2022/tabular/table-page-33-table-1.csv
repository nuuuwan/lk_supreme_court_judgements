"“.....the Petitioners cannot rely on the relevant Cabinet Decision to get relief on the"
"basis that their names are included in a report of political victimization committee as"
"such a decision cannot be considered as a decision pertaining to a matter of policy"
"for the aforementioned reasons.”"
"“…..This Court cannot directly or indirectly enforce recommendations made solely"
"on   political   reasons,   by   implementing   recommendations   made   by   a   Political"
"Victimization Committee.”"
"Furthermore, in the same judgment Justice Padman Surasena, emphasised that “….It"
"is important to bear in mind that the policies the Cabinet of Ministers are empowered"
"to make must be only to lay down mere schemes of promotions in the nature of"
"general rules and regulation and not decisions to promote any individual public or"
"Police   officer.   On   the   other   hand,   any   recommendation   made   by   the   Cabinet   of"
"Ministers to promote individuals cannot be categorized as policy decisions falling"
"under Article 55(1) or 155 G 3(a) of the Constitution.”"
"If a system or set of guidelines was introduced to address political victimization, it"
"could have been classified as a policy. However, an ad-hoc decision to grant relief to"
"certain individuals claiming political victimization cannot be regarded as a  policy."
"Therefore, it is evident that the 48th Respondent in this case is not entitled to obtain"
"relief based on the Cabinet decision dated June 28, 2021, on the grounds of alleged"
"political victimization."
"The Petitioners assert that they served as Chief Inspectors of Police under similar"
"circumstances as the 48th Respondent, who was promoted to that rank on February 8,"
"2020,   alongside   the   Petitioners.  Therefore,   they   had   a   legitimate   expectation   that"
"individuals in comparable situations would be treated equally."
