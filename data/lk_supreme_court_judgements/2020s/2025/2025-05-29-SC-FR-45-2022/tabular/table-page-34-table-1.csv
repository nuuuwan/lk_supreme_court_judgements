"Furthermore,   the   subsequent   arbitrary   and   irrational   decision   of   the   1st 
to   46th"
"Respondents,   and/or   any   of   them   based   on   the   purported   Cabinet   decision,   to"
"retroactively date the 48th Respondent’s appointment as Chief Inspector to January 1,"
"2014, resulted in the 48th Respondent being placed higher on the seniority list. This"
"gave   the   48th  Respondent   an   advantageous   position   for   selection   to   the   post   of"
"Assistant   Superintendent   of   Police,
  which   is   the   Petitioner’s   next   potential"
"promotion, thereby creating an inequitable situation and significantly prejudicing the"
"Petitioner’s promotional prospects."
"Therefore, I regret my inability to accept that 5th to 31st Respondents had acted within"
"their powers under Article 55 (1) of the Constitution when backdating the promotion"
"of the 48th Respondent to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police to January 1, 2014."
"Consequently,   the   unlawful   backdating   of   the   48th  Respondent’s   promotion   has"
"infringed upon the fundamental rights guaranteed to the Petitioners under Article"
"12(1) of the Constitution. Because, as per Article 12(1), all persons are equal before"
"the law and are entitled to the equal protection of law. In order to clarify the above"
"conclusion in detail, I will now scrutinize few judicial precedents that were held by"
"foreign and local superior courts."
"Violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution"
"The principle of equality serves as a golden thread running through the entire legal"
"system.   The   International   Inter-American   Court   of   Human   Rights   opined   in   the"
"Advisory Opinion on “Juridical Condition and Rights of Undocumented Migrants’’"
"that equality and non-discrimination had become jus cogens, peremptory norm of"
"international law.  Because, the whole legal structure of national and international"
"public   order   has   based   on   the   said   principle.17 
In   the   preamble   of   the   1978"
"Constitution also, it has specifically guaranteed the principle of “equality” of all"
"Peoples and succeeding generations of the people. Because, as Justice Bhagawathi"
"has emphasised in the case of Royappa v State of Tamil Nadu18,"
