"At   the   Cabinet   meeting   held   on   June   28,  2021,   the   aforementioned   Cabinet"
"Memorandum   (“X9”)   was   considered.   On   the   same   date,  Cabinet   of   Ministers,"
"including the 5th to 31st Respondents, decided to implement the recommendations of"
"the Committee at the earliest."
"Accordingly, the 33rd  Respondent, the Public Service Commission, comprising the"
"34th to 42nd Respondents as its Chairman and members, unequivocally instructed the"
"44th  Respondent, the Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security (vide"
"‘X11’), to implement the decisions taken by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting"
"on June 28, 2021, concerning the Cabinet Memorandum dated April 1, 2021."
"Consequent   to   the   aforementioned   direction   issued   by   the   33rd  Respondent,   the"
"Public Service Commission, the 44th  Respondent, directed the 46th  Respondent, the"
"Inspector-General   of   Police,   by   letter   dated  August   20,   2021   (“X12”),   to   act   in"
"accordance with the orders of the Public Service Commission."
"Accordingly,   the   46th  Respondent,   by   letter   dated  August   26,   2021,   ordered   the"
"backdating   of   the   48th  Respondent's   promotion   to   the   rank   of   Chief   Inspector   of"
"Police to January 1, 2014, from the existing date of promotion, February 8, 2020"
"(“X13”). The Petitioners state that the purported decision, recommendation, and/or"
"order by the 1st to 46th Respondents, or any one of them, constitutes a clear breach of"
"Gazette   (Extraordinary)   No.   1589/30,   dated   February   20,   2009,   which   provides"
"regulations   for   the   appointment,   promotion,   and   transfer   of   public   servants   and"
"categorically prohibits antedating appointments under Rule 31(“X14”). However, this"
"is not an absolute rule and is subject to the exception contained in Rule 188 of the"
"same Gazette notification."
"The 46th  Respondent, through RTM-199 (CRTM-114) dated July 4, 2021, (“X16”)"
"issued a call for the filling of vacancies for the rank of Assistant Superintendent of"
"Police based on seniority and skills. This, the Petitioners claim, further exacerbated"
"the violation of their fundamental rights by inviting only officers who met the criteria"
"of seniority and skill. Consequently, the 46th  Respondent by RTM-128 (CRTM-53)"
