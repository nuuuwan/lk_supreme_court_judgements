"In this context, it is essential to assess the scope of authority that the Cabinet of"
"Ministers are expected to exercise under the concept of policy as outlined in Article"
"55(1). Accordingly, an analysis of the defining characteristics of a policy decision is"
"warranted."
"The Black’s Law Dictionary11 defines the term ‘policy’ as the general principles by"
"which   a   government   is   guided   in   its   management   of   public   affairs’”.   In   the   11th"
"edition of Black’s Law Dictionary, the same term has been defined as “A standard"
"cause of action that has been officially established by an organization, business,"
"political party etc.’"
"It is also pertinent to examine the judicial precedents from both local and foreign"
"jurisdictions, on the subject matter."
"In  R(A)v Secretary of State for the Home Department  12  Lord Sales JSC and Lord"
"Burnett of Maldon CJ set out as follows:"
"“a policy, may provide them with guidance so that they apply the powers in similar"
"ways and the risk of arbitrary or capricious differences of outcome is reduced. If"
"placed   in   the   public   domain,   policies   can   help   individuals   to   understand   how"
"discretionary powers are likely to be exercised in their situations and can provide"
"standards against which public authorities can be held to account. In all these ways,"
"policies can be an important tool in promoting good administration.”"
"Apart from the above case, in R (Friends of the Earth Ltd) v. Secretary of State for"
"Transport  13, the following observations were perceived by Lord Hodge DPSC and"
"Lord Sales JSC of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom,"
"“……  the   epitome   of   ‘Government   Policy’  is   a   formal   written   statement   of"
"established policy. One reason for this is that civil servants and others must be able"
"to identify the policy which is said to be legally enforceable quickly and conveniently."
"It is important in this context that there should be legal certainty…… A statement"
"qualifies   as   a   policy   only   if   it   is   clear,   unambiguous   and   devoid   of   relevant"
"qualification.” (Emphasis added)"
