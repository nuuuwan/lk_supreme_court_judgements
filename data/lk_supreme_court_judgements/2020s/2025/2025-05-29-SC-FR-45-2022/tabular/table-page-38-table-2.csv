"attached   to   such   promotion   are   facets   of   fundamental   right   under Article"
"16(1).‚Äù"
"In the Sri Lankan constitution, unlike in the Indian context,  the right to equality"
"and   the   right   to   engage   in   profession   have   been   laid   down   in   two   different"
"Articles,   respectively   in  Article   12   (1)   and  Article   14(1)(g).Therefore,   when"
"determining the legitimacy of a promotion granted to a public officer, the Court"
"should read Article 14(1)(g)  in concurrence with Article 12(1) of the Constitution"
"in order to give effect to the meaningful interpretation of the Article 14(1)(g)."
"Because,   both   these   Articles   are   intrinsically   interconnected.   Therefore,   a"
"violation   of  Article   12(1)   due   to   the   denial   of   rightful   promotions,   as   in   the"
"present   case,   would   inevitably   result   in   a   breach   of  Article   14(1)(g)   as   well."
"Therefore, based on the arguments and materials presented above, I am convinced"
"that the Petitioners have established a violation of their Fundamental Rights under"
"Article 14(1)(g)."
