Introduction

The 1st to 22nd Petitioners were serving as Chief Inspectors of Police at the time of

filing this petition.

The 1st to 4th Respondents are the Chairman and Committee members of the

‘Providing Relief to Government and Semi-Government Employees Subjected to

Political Victimization Committee.’ The 5th to 31st Respondents are Cabinet Ministers,

while the 32nd Respondent is the Secretary to the Cabinet. The 33rd Respondent is the

Public Service Commission, and the 34th to 42nd Respondents are its chairman and

members. The 43rd Respondent is the Secretary to the Public Service Commission.

The 44th and 45th Respondents hold the positions of Additional Secretary and

Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security, respectively. The 46th Respondent is the

Inspector-General of Police, and the 47th Respondent is the Attorney General. The

48th Respondent is the police officer whose promotion to the rank of Chief Inspector

of Police was backdated and is being challenged in this application.

In this petition, the Petitioners seek, inter alia, a declaration that the directive issued

by the Inspector-General of Police, backdating the promotion of the 48th Respondent

(‘X13’) and filling vacancies for the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police

through interviews based on seniority and skills (‘X16’), are null and void, on the

ground that these decisions infringe upon their fundamental rights guaranteed under

Article 12(1) and/or Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. The Petitioners assert that

backdating of the 48th Respondent’s promotion on the ground of political

SC/FRA/0045/2022 15

victimization unfairly discriminates against them and infringes upon their

fundamental rights, despite being in similar circumstances.

In this context, the Petitioners in this petition have sought, inter alia to:

“

(e) Declare that the fundamental rights guaranteed to the Petitioners under

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution has been infringed and/or is being

continuously infringed by the 1st to 46th Respondents and/or any one or more

of them,

(f) Declare that the fundamental rights guaranteed to the Petitioners under

Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution has been infringed and/or is being

continuously infringed by the 1st to 46th Respondents and/or any one or more

of them,

(g) Declare null and void RT-761 CRTM-389 issued by the 46th Respondent

marked ‘X13’, RTM-199 (CRTM-114) dated 07.04.2021 issued by the 46th

Respondent marked ‘X16’ and RTM 128 (CRTM 53) dated 04.09.2021 marked

‘X17’ annexed hereto,

(h) Declare that the purported recommendations and/or decisions by one or more

of the Respondents and/or anyone or more of them and/or their servants and

agents to backdate the appointment of the 48th Respondent to the rank of

‘Chief Inspector of Police’ effective from 01.01.2014 is illegal and of no force

or effect in the law;

(i) Declare that the 48th Respondent is ineligible to be appointed to the rank of

‘Assistant Superintendent of Police’ in the immediate appointments to be

made for the said rank in the Sri Lanka Police Service;”

This Court, having heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners

and the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the 5th to 32nd, 34th to 47th, and

49th to 56th Respondents, by its order dated July 4, 2024, granted leave to proceed

SC/FRA/0045/2022 16

under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. In addition, the Court

also granted interim relief in line with prayer (m) of the petition, restraining the

Respondents from promoting the 48th Respondent to the rank of Assistant

Superintendent of Police until the final determination of this application. The Court

also directed the re-issuance of notices to the Respondents who were absent and

unrepresented and fixed deadlines for filing objections and counter-affidavits. The

hearing was scheduled for February 3, 2025.

Notably, despite multiple notices issued by this Court, the 48th Respondent has failed

to appear before Court. Furthermore, none of the Respondents, including those

represented by the Attorney General have filed objections to the Petitioner’s

application.

At the hearing, the Court heard the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner and the learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 5th to 32nd, 34th

to 37th, and 49th to 56th Respondents.

Factual background

The Petitioners are police officers currently serving in the rank of Chief Inspectors of

Police (C.I.) at various police stations and divisions. According to the Petitioners,

they all joined the police service as Sub Inspectors of Police (S. I.). The 1st to 12th,

14th to 18th, and 20th to 22nd Petitioners joined the service on November 26, 2000,

while the 13th and 19th Petitioners joined on December 15, 2000. Except for the 10th

and 12th Petitioners, all other officers were absorbed into the regular police force

from the reserve police force on the specified dates. The Petitioners state that their

service in the police force has been uninterrupted since their initial joining. They

have set out a table detailing the dates of their subsequent promotions to the ranks of

Inspector of Police and Chief Inspector of Police, in paragraph 8 of the Petition.

The 48th Respondent was also in the same batch as the 1st to 12th, 14th to 18th, and 20th

to 22nd Petitioners, having joined the police service as a Sub Inspector of Police on

November 26, 2000. The 48th Respondent was promoted to the rank of Inspector of

SC/FRA/0045/2022 17

Police on February 8, 2010, and to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police on February

8, 2020, along with the 1st to 22nd Petitioners.

On January 8, 2020, the Cabinet of Ministers at the time, after considering Cabinet

Memorandum No. 20/0076/202/002-1 submitted by the contemporary Prime

Minister, decided to appoint a Committee to submit a report with

recommendations for providing relief to government and semi-government

employees who had been subjected to political victimization. The three-member

Committee was initially chaired by Minister Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena and was

later by Minister Gamini Lokuge.

The 1st to 4th Respondents, being the Chairman and Committee members of the

‘Providing Relief to Government and Semi-Government Employees who were

subjected to Political Victimization Committee’, by way of a committee report dated

January 15, 2021 (“X 8”) submitted recommendations pertaining to 83 police officers

who were allegedly subjected to political victimization.

The Committee observed that the 48th Respondent’s promotions were denied on two

occasions: first, due to an alleged incident that occurred during his absence from the

island, and second, because of a pending charge sheet, which rendered him ineligible

to apply for the post of Chief Inspector (“X 8”). Although the Committee observed as

above, no material was placed before Court by the Petitioner to substantiate this

position. Moreover, these incidents should apparently have occurred before his last

promotion to Chief Inspector of Police, along with the Petitioners.

The Petitioners submit that, to the best of their knowledge, the 48th Respondent has

never been served with a charge sheet, nor has he undergone a disciplinary inquiry.

He has neither been interdicted nor issued a vacation of post and has never been

subjected to any form of political victimization. Despite this, he has been allowed to

submit a claim alleging political victimization.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 18

Nevertheless, the Committee had recommended that the promotion of the 48th

Respondent to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police be backdated to January 1, 2014,

with corresponding promotions granted accordingly.

Thereafter, Cabinet Memorandum No. 12/2021, dated April 1, 2021, (“X9”) was

presented to the Cabinet, of which the 5th to 31st Respondents were members. As can

be easily perceived from the Cabinet memorandum, the implementation of the

proposals made by the Committee was forwarded to the Cabinet with the

recommendation to accept them, as they were made by a Committee headed by a

Senior Minister and comprising senior officials, subject to the following conditions.

i.To delegate the powers to the Secretary to the Public Service Commission,

Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security and Inspector-General of

Police for the purpose of implementing the recommendations of the

Committee.

ii. If there are no sufficient number of vacancies within the approved cadre in

the post, to appoint the officers individually, on supernumerary basis and

to absorb them to the approved cadre when a vacancy arises (it is not

required to obtain approval of Management Service Department for this

purpose. In the event where an officer recruited on supernumerary basis is

retired/deceased or in the event retiring in future, the post created on the

supernumerary basis cease to exist).

Thus, the implementation of the Cabinet decision must necessarily be subject to the

aforesaid conditions. Consequently, if the promotions exceed the cadre vacancies,

they must be made on a supernumerary basis and absorbed into the permanent cadre

as vacancies arise, ensuring their place in the permanent cadre. Another condition

that was set out by the Cabinet was that the approval of the Department of

Management Services is not necessary for these promotions, thereby overlooked the

objective of the requirement of obtaining the approval of Management Service

Department.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 19

At the Cabinet meeting held on June 28, 2021, the aforementioned Cabinet

Memorandum (“X9”) was considered. On the same date, Cabinet of Ministers,

including the 5th to 31st Respondents, decided to implement the recommendations of

the Committee at the earliest.

Accordingly, the 33rd Respondent, the Public Service Commission, comprising the

34th to 42nd Respondents as its Chairman and members, unequivocally instructed the

44th Respondent, the Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security (vide

‘X11’), to implement the decisions taken by the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting

on June 28, 2021, concerning the Cabinet Memorandum dated April 1, 2021.

Consequent to the aforementioned direction issued by the 33rd Respondent, the

Public Service Commission, the 44th Respondent, directed the 46th Respondent, the

Inspector-General of Police, by letter dated August 20, 2021 (“X12”), to act in

accordance with the orders of the Public Service Commission.

Accordingly, the 46th Respondent, by letter dated August 26, 2021, ordered the

backdating of the 48th Respondent's promotion to the rank of Chief Inspector of

Police to January 1, 2014, from the existing date of promotion, February 8, 2020

(“X13”). The Petitioners state that the purported decision, recommendation, and/or

order by the 1st to 46th Respondents, or any one of them, constitutes a clear breach of

Gazette (Extraordinary) No. 1589/30, dated February 20, 2009, which provides

regulations for the appointment, promotion, and transfer of public servants and

categorically prohibits antedating appointments under Rule 31(“X14”). However, this

is not an absolute rule and is subject to the exception contained in Rule 188 of the

same Gazette notification.

The 46th Respondent, through RTM-199 (CRTM-114) dated July 4, 2021, (“X16”)

issued a call for the filling of vacancies for the rank of Assistant Superintendent of

Police based on seniority and skills. This, the Petitioners claim, further exacerbated

the violation of their fundamental rights by inviting only officers who met the criteria

of seniority and skill. Consequently, the 46th Respondent by RTM-128 (CRTM-53)

SC/FRA/0045/2022 20

dated September 4, 2021 (“X17”) has summoned the 48th Respondent and three

others to the interview board.

Relevant Constitutional modifications

Before addressing the merits of this application, it is essential to first examine the

constitutional changes that have occurred within our Constitution concerning the

powers and functions related to the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary

control, and dismissal of police officers.

On this point, there is a significant judicial precedent that I must consider first and

foremost. In the case of Saman Ratnayake and four others v National Police

Commission and eighteen others1 Justice Padman Surasena analysed in detail the

evolution of the powers and functions relating to appointment, promotion, transfer,

disciplinary control, and dismissal of public officers within the constitutional

framework in Sri Lanka. For the purpose of completeness, I will also concisely

analyse the same.

The Public Service Commission was first established in Sri Lanka by Article 58 of

the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council, 1946. Article 60 of the Constitution

conferred upon it the authority over the appointment, transfer, dismissal, and

disciplinary control of public officers. Aforementioned Article 60 provides as

follows:

“Article 60 (1)

The appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of public officers

is hereby vested in the Public Service Commission:

Provided that …”

1SC(FR) 350/2016

SC/FRA/0045/2022 21

However, the first Republican Constitution of 1972 abolished the Public Service

Commission and, under Section 106, transferred these powers to the Cabinet of

Ministers. And the said Section is as follows:

Section 106 (1) -The Cabinet of Ministers shall be responsible for the appointment,

transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of state officers and shall be answerable

therefore to the National State Assembly

(2) - Subject to the provisions of the Constitution the Cabinet of Ministers

shall have the power of appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of

all state officers.

Even under the Second Republican Constitution of 1978, the powers of appointment,

transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of public officers, including the Heads of

Department remained with the Cabinet of Ministers. However, provisions were made

for the delegation of these powers to the Public Service Commission from time to

time, excluding the Heads of Departments. Other than the powers regarding the

appointment, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers, the

powers in respect of ‘promotions’ was also included into the Article 55.

For clarity, I will reproduce Article 55 of the 1978 Constitution in its original form,

which reads as follows:

“55(1) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the appointment, transfer,

dismissal and disciplinary control of public officers is hereby vested in the Cabinet of

Ministers, and all public officers shall hold office at pleasure.

(2) The Cabinet of Ministers shall not delegate its powers of appointment,

transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control in respect of Heads of Departments.

(3) The Cabinet of Ministers may from time-to-time delegate its powers of

appointment, transfer, dismissal and disciplinary control of other public officers to

the Public Service Commission.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 22

Provided that (…)

(4) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers shall

provide for and determine all matters relating to public officers including the

formulation of schemes of recruitment and codes of conduct for public officers, the

principles to be followed in making promotions and transfers, and the procedure for

the exercise and the delegation of the powers of appointment, transfer dismissal and

disciplinary control of public officers.”

(Emphasis added)

Prior to the introduction of term ‘policy’, the aforementioned constitutional

provisions were judicially interpreted in following judgments. In the case of

Abeywickrema v. Pathirana2 Chief Justice Sharvananda interpreting Article 55 (4) of

the 1978 Constitution as it stood before the 17th Amendment to the Constitution made

the following observations in the majority judgment;

‘Article 55 (4) empowers the Cabinet of Ministers to make rules for all matters

relating to public officers, without impinging upon the overriding powers of pleasure

recognized under Article 55(1). Matters relating to "public officer" comprehends all

matters relating to employment, which are incidental to employment and form part of

the terms and conditions of such employment, such as, provisions as to salary,

increments, leave, gratuity, pension, and of super annuity, promotion and every

termination of employment and removal from service. The power conferred on the

Cabinet of Ministers is a power to make rules which are general in their operation,

though they may be applied to a particular class of public officers. This power is a

legislative power and this rule making function is for the purpose identified in Article

55(4) of the Constitution as legislative, not executive or judicial in character.’

(Emphasis added)

Furthermore, in the subsequent case of The Public Service United Nurses Union v.

Montague Jayawickrama, Minister of Public Administration and others3 Justice

2[1996]1 Sri L.R. 120, at p.l38.3[1988]1 Sri L.R. p. 229, at p. 237.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 23

Wanasundara made the following observations regarding the authority vested in the

Cabinet over the public officers.

‘When Article 55 of the Constitution vests authority over public affairs in the Cabinet

and make it mandatory for the Cabinet to formulate schemes of recruitment, and

codes of conduct for public officers, the principles to be followed in making

promotions and transfers etc., the Constitution contemplated fair, and uniform

provisions in the nature of general rules and regulations and not action that is

arbitrary or ad-hoc or savouring of bias or discrimination.’ (Emphasis added)

With the introduction of the 17th Amendment, following the aforementioned

judgments of this Court in Abeywickrema v. Pathirana (supra) and The Public

Service United Nurses Union v. Montague Jayawickrama, Minister of Public

Administration and others (supra), the Legislature repealed the existing Article 55(1)

and replaced it with a revised provision incorporating the term ‘all matters of policy

relating to public officers’ in place of the phrase ‘all matters relating to public

officers.’ Consequently, the Cabinet of Ministers’ authority to make rules was

confined solely to matters concerning policy.

Article 55 remained unchanged until the introduction of the 17th Amendment to the

Constitution,4 which brought significant changes by replacing it with a new text. The

amended Articles 55(1), (3), and (4) read as follows:

“55(1) The appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of

public officers shall be vested in the Commission.

55(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article, the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of all Heads of

Departments shall vest in the Cabinet of Ministers, who shall exercise such powers

after ascertaining the views of the Commission.

55(4) Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers shall

provide for and determine all matters of policy relating to public officers.

4Certified on 03th October, 2001

SC/FRA/0045/2022 24

55(5) (……...)

(Emphasis added)

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers was vested with the power to provide for and

determine matters of policy related to public officers, subject to the provisions of the

Constitution, while the Public Service Commission conducted its affairs in

accordance with such policies.

Another change introduced by the 17th amendment was the removal of the phrase

"all public officers shall hold the office at pleasure," which had been present in our

Constitution since its inception during British reign. The concept of holding office at

pleasure implied that dismissal could be at the discretion of the authority, meaning

public officers could be terminated for any reason, whether good or bad, or

sometimes without any reason at all. However, since Article 55(1) of the 1978

Constitution contained the term “subject to the provisions of the Constitution," any

action taken under this article is, inter alia, subject to the provisions of Article 126.

Apart from that, the 17th Amendment to the Constitution also introduced a procedure

allowing a party aggrieved by a decision of the Public Service Commission to appeal

to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Additionally, the introduction of Article 61A through the 17th Amendment ensured

that the Supreme Court still retained its jurisdiction over fundamental rights

concerning decisions made by the Public Service Commission, whether exercised

directly or through its delegated authority.

Most importantly, the 17th Amendment to the Constitution brought in a distinctive

change by introducing the new chapter XVIIIA establishing the National Police

Commission under Article 155A and vesting it with the powers in relation to the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police

officers other than the Inspector-General of Police. The Commission exercised such

powers in consultation with the Inspector -General of Police.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 25

However, the 18th Amendment to the Constitution repealed Article 155G and also

repealed the existing Article 55, replacing it with a revised provision. Consequently,

the powers over all matters of policy related to public officers, including those

concerning appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control, and dismissal,

were reverted to the Cabinet of Ministers.5 Additionally, the appointments,

promotions, transfers, disciplinary control, and dismissal of all Heads of

Departments were also entrusted to the Cabinet of Ministers.6Furthermore, subject to

the provisions of the Constitution, the powers related to the appointments,

promotions, transfers, disciplinary control, and dismissal of public officers were

granted to the Public Service Commission.7 As a result, police officers were also

classified under the category of public officers.

In the 18th Amendment, the Legislature removed the words "subject to the provisions

of the Constitution" that were there in Article 55(4) introduced by the 17th

Amendment. However, it retained the power of the Cabinet of Ministers to determine

"all matters of policy relating to public officers, including policy relating to

appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control, and dismissal" in the

corresponding amended Article 55(1).

The resulting position is that the Cabinet of Ministers were vested with the power to

provide for and recommend all the matters of policy relating to public officers

without the limitation of being “subject to the provisions of the Constitution”.

However, it is easily perceived that in a constitutional structure, no functionary of the

state or public authority has an absolute or unfettered discretion. The very idea of

unfettered discretion is totally incompatible with the doctrine of equality enshrined in

the Constitution and it is also against the rule of law. It is presumed that even the

discretionary powers conferred on executive in absolute and unfettered terms will

necessarily and obviously be exercised reasonably and for the betterment of the

public.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 26

As per Article 126 (1) ‘The Supreme Court shall have sole and exclusive jurisdiction

to hear and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent

infringement by executive or administrative action of any fundamental right ….’.

Therefore, it is evident that the Supreme Court's fundamental rights jurisdiction over

decisions made under Article 55(1) remains unaffected.

The 19th Amendment to the constitution8 re-transferred the powers in relation to the

appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal of the police

officers except the Inspector-General of Police, to the National Police Commission

by re-introduction of Article 155G. Consequently, the powers in relation to police

officers’ appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal

were taken away from the Public Service Commission and reassigned to the National

Police Commission.

With the introduction of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution9, the legislature, for

the second time, took away the powers of the National Police Commission and re-

transferred to the Public Service Commission. As per the 20th Amendment to the

constitution Article 55 of the constitution reads as follows:

Article 55 (1) – The Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for and determine all matters

of policy relating to public officers, including policy relating to appointments,

promotions, transfers, disciplinary control, and dismissal.

(2) The appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control, and dismissal

of Heads of Department shall, vest in the Cabinet of Ministers.

Accordingly, at the time relevant to the instant application, the powers and functions

related to the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control, and dismissal of

police officers were vested with the Public Service Commission except for the Heads

of Departments.

However, with the enactment of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution10 up to date,

the powers in relation to appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control, and

dismissal of police officers other than the Inspector-General of Police are re-vested

with the National Police Commission. For clarity, I will reproduce the relevant

provisions of Article 155G which were re-introduced by the 21st Amendment.

Article 155G (1)(a) -The appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control, and

dismissal of police officers other than the Inspector-General of Police shall be vested

within the Commission. The Commission shall exercise its power of promotion,

transfer disciplinary control, and dismissal in consultation with the Inspector-

General of Police.

(3) The Commission shall, in consultation with the Inspector-General of Police,

(Emphasis added)

Accordingly, following the 21st Amendment, the formulation of recruitment,

promotion, and transfer schemes should be carried out by the National Police

Commission, in consultation with the Inspector General of Police, subject to the

policies determined by the Cabinet of Ministers.

However, the Cabinet decision in question was made on June 28, 2021, prior to the

introduction of the 21st Amendment, at the time when the 20th Amendment was in

force. As I have already stated in this judgment, during this period, the powers of the

National Police Commission regarding the appointment, promotion, transfer,

disciplinary control, and dismissal of police officers, excluding Heads of

Departments, were exercised by the Public Service Commission. Apart from that, in

terms of Policy decisions, the Cabinet of Ministers were assigned with the power to

determine all matters of policy relating to public officers, including policy relating to

appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control and dismissal as per Article

55 (1) which was the same provision that was there in the Constitution since the 18th

Amendment.

“Policy” in the context of promotions

I will now proceed to examine the scope of authority granted to the Cabinet of

Ministers concerning matters related to public officers under the Constitution. Under

Article 55(1) of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers holds the authority to

provide for and determine all matters of policy related to public officers, including

those concerning appointments, promotions, transfers, disciplinary control, and

dismissal. Article 55(2) further stipulates that the appointment, promotion, transfer,

disciplinary control, and dismissal of all Heads of Departments shall be vested in the

Cabinet of Ministers.

It is a well-established principle that Courts should generally refrain from intervening

in policy matters that fall within the government's domain, except where such

policies are contrary to the law or inconsistent with the Constitution.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 29

In this context, it is essential to assess the scope of authority that the Cabinet of

Ministers are expected to exercise under the concept of policy as outlined in Article

55(1). Accordingly, an analysis of the defining characteristics of a policy decision is

warranted.

The Black’s Law Dictionary11 defines the term ‘policy’ as the general principles by

which a government is guided in its management of public affairs’”. In the 11th

edition of Black’s Law Dictionary, the same term has been defined as “A standard

cause of action that has been officially established by an organization, business,

political party etc.’

It is also pertinent to examine the judicial precedents from both local and foreign

jurisdictions, on the subject matter.

In R(A)v Secretary of State for the Home Department 12 Lord Sales JSC and Lord

Burnett of Maldon CJ set out as follows:

“a policy, may provide them with guidance so that they apply the powers in similar

ways and the risk of arbitrary or capricious differences of outcome is reduced. If

placed in the public domain, policies can help individuals to understand how

discretionary powers are likely to be exercised in their situations and can provide

standards against which public authorities can be held to account. In all these ways,

policies can be an important tool in promoting good administration.”

Apart from the above case, in R (Friends of the Earth Ltd) v. Secretary of State for

Transport 13, the following observations were perceived by Lord Hodge DPSC and

Lord Sales JSC of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom,

“…… the epitome of ‘Government Policy’ is a formal written statement of

established policy. One reason for this is that civil servants and others must be able

to identify the policy which is said to be legally enforceable quickly and conveniently.

It is important in this context that there should be legal certainty…… A statement

qualifies as a policy only if it is clear, unambiguous and devoid of relevant

qualification.” (Emphasis added)

11 Black’s Law Dictionary, 11th Edition, Bryan A. Garner12 [2021] UKSC 37: [2021] 1WLR 393113 [2020] UKSC 52: [2021] PTSR 190

SC/FRA/0045/2022 30

In Delhi Development Authority v Joint Action Committee, Allotte of SFS Flats14 it

was held that, “an executive order termed as a policy decision is not beyond the pale

of judicial review. Whereas the superior courts may not interfere with the nitty-gritty

of the policy, or substitute one by the other but it will not be correct to contend that

court shall lay its judicial hands off, when a plea is raised that the impugned

decision is policy decision.”

Pronouncements of this Court regarding the concept of “policy”

In Saman Ratnayake and Four others v. National Police Commission and Eighteen

Others15, Justice Padman Surasena, in his judgment, cited the following observations

made by Justice Shirani A. Bandaranayake in Poojya Mawanane Sominda Thero and

Thirteen Others v. V. K. Nanayakkara and Eleven Others16, after examining a policy

matter within the scope of Article 55(4), introduced by the 17th Amendment to the

Constitution, as follows:

“The Concise Oxford Dictionary refers to a matter of policy as the 'course or

general plan of action to be adopted by government, party or a person'. Professor

Galligan, on the other hand, defines a decision of policy in the following words (Due

Process and Fair Procedures, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1996, pg. 454),

‘A decision of policy is one where the authority has to draw on general

considerations of a social, economic or ethical kind in deciding an issue, where the

decision is likely to affect a range of groups and interests.’

“Accordingly, the general norm in the definition of 'a policy matter' would be for the

action taken to be for the common good. As pointed out by Professor Galligan

(supra) while interests and claims of individuals and groups are ingredients to be

added to the cauldron of policy- making the final decision should reach beyond

particular concerns to a broader sense of the interests of all". The necessity for the

generalization therefore would be the essential ingredient in defining 'policy' and

this is clear as one examines the meaning given to the said word in the Oxford

Companion to Law, where it reads thus:

14 (2008) 2SCC 67215 SC(FR) 350/201616 SC. (FR) 146/2003, Supreme Court minutes dated 15.07.2004

SC/FRA/0045/2022 31

‘The general consideration which a governing body has in mind in legislating,

deciding on a course of action or otherwise acting (David Walker; Clarendon Press

Oxford, 1980. pg.965).’

Therefore, a policy decision necessarily will have to be applicable in general and

cannot be interpreted to include specified persons.

The Cabinet Memorandum dated 03.09.2001 (1 R3) basically deals with 3 main

items. The first item is with regard to the creation of a post designated as

Assistant/Deputy Director (Pirivena) for each Provincial Department of Education.

The second item refers to the absorption of 8 priests who were holding the positions

as Pirivena Coordinators in different provinces. The third item is the upgrading of

the ten Lecturers presently attached to the Sudharmarama Pirivena at Avissawella.

An examination of the said items would clearly indicate that item 1.1 of the

Memorandum clearly deals with a policy matter as it relates in general to the

creation of a specific post. The second limb of this item, viz., item 1.2 however

refers to the appointment of 8 selected persons and thereby is not in a category

which deals with policy matters. This could have been avoided, if there was no

special reference to the appointment of 8 persons who were holding positions as

Pirivena Co-ordinators. The next item in the Memorandum is not dealing with a

policy matter as it clearly refers to the absorption of 10 lecturers who had been

serving for a period of over 10 years at the Sudharmarama Pirivena at Avissawella.

In the circumstances, it is apparent that the first item which deals with the creation of

a post designated as Assistant/Deputy Director (Pirivena) for each Provincial

Department of Education deals with a policy matter and the other two items do not

come within the category of policy.” (Emphasis added)

In the aforementioned Saman Rathnayake case (supra), Justice Padman Surasena

addressing a similar issue, in which a Cabinet decision was made on the

recommendations of the Committee titled “To provide relief to those who were

victimized for political reasons” observed that,

“…..a policy decision must be applicable in general as opposed to specific

individuals. If a particular policy decision focuses on specific individuals and fails to

SC/FRA/0045/2022 32

be applicable in a general context, it will not fall within the ambit of a policy

decision”

“.....the Petitioners cannot rely on the relevant Cabinet Decision to get relief on the

basis that their names are included in a report of political victimization committee as

such a decision cannot be considered as a decision pertaining to a matter of policy

for the aforementioned reasons.”

“…..This Court cannot directly or indirectly enforce recommendations made solely

on political reasons, by implementing recommendations made by a Political

Victimization Committee.”

Furthermore, in the same judgment Justice Padman Surasena, emphasised that “….It

is important to bear in mind that the policies the Cabinet of Ministers are empowered

to make must be only to lay down mere schemes of promotions in the nature of

general rules and regulation and not decisions to promote any individual public or

Police officer. On the other hand, any recommendation made by the Cabinet of

Ministers to promote individuals cannot be categorized as policy decisions falling

under Article 55(1) or 155 G 3(a) of the Constitution.”

If a system or set of guidelines was introduced to address political victimization, it

could have been classified as a policy. However, an ad-hoc decision to grant relief to

certain individuals claiming political victimization cannot be regarded as a policy.

Therefore, it is evident that the 48th Respondent in this case is not entitled to obtain

relief based on the Cabinet decision dated June 28, 2021, on the grounds of alleged

political victimization.

The Petitioners assert that they served as Chief Inspectors of Police under similar

circumstances as the 48th Respondent, who was promoted to that rank on February 8,

2020, alongside the Petitioners. Therefore, they had a legitimate expectation that

individuals in comparable situations would be treated equally.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 33

Furthermore, the subsequent arbitrary and irrational decision of the 1st to 46th

Respondents, and/or any of them based on the purported Cabinet decision, to

retroactively date the 48th Respondent’s appointment as Chief Inspector to January 1,

2014, resulted in the 48th Respondent being placed higher on the seniority list. This

gave the 48th Respondent an advantageous position for selection to the post of

Assistant Superintendent of Police, which is the Petitioner’s next potential

promotion, thereby creating an inequitable situation and significantly prejudicing the

Petitioner’s promotional prospects.

Therefore, I regret my inability to accept that 5th to 31st Respondents had acted within

their powers under Article 55 (1) of the Constitution when backdating the promotion

of the 48th Respondent to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police to January 1, 2014.

Consequently, the unlawful backdating of the 48th Respondent’s promotion has

infringed upon the fundamental rights guaranteed to the Petitioners under Article

12(1) of the Constitution. Because, as per Article 12(1), all persons are equal before

the law and are entitled to the equal protection of law. In order to clarify the above

conclusion in detail, I will now scrutinize few judicial precedents that were held by

foreign and local superior courts.

Violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

The principle of equality serves as a golden thread running through the entire legal

system. The International Inter-American Court of Human Rights opined in the

Advisory Opinion on “Juridical Condition and Rights of Undocumented Migrants’’

that equality and non-discrimination had become jus cogens, peremptory norm of

international law. Because, the whole legal structure of national and international

public order has based on the said principle.17 In the preamble of the 1978

Constitution also, it has specifically guaranteed the principle of “equality” of all

Peoples and succeeding generations of the people. Because, as Justice Bhagawathi

has emphasised in the case of Royappa v State of Tamil Nadu18,

17 Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka, 3rd Edition, Jayampathy Wickramaratne18 Royappa v State of Tamil Nadu [1974] SCR (2) 348

SC/FRA/0045/2022 34

“Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be

‘cribbed, cabined and confined’ within traditional and doctrinaire limits.”

(Emphasis added)

In that sense, the principle of equality can be considered as the ‘jewel in the crown’

of the fundamental rights chapter. Because, it is an inalienable universal principle

embedded into our Constitution; the main legal source in the country, from which

the legitimacy is derived to all the other legal instruments. In the instant case, the

Petitioners mainly challenge the legitimacy of the promotion granted to a

Respondent based on the Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g). Unfortunately, in the Sri

Lankan context, there is no such direct fundamental right as a “right to promotion”

nor does it extend to seniority. But, the ‘legal right of the public officers to be

considered for promotion subject to the doctrine of equality’ has been emphasized

by this Court several times.

In W.P.S. Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority19 Justice Yasantha Kodagoda P.C.

has evaluated the nexus between Article 12(1) and the appointments and promotions

in the public service. Accordingly, Justice Kodagoda has pointed out the following

observations.

“It would thus be seen that arbitrariness and unreasonableness in decision-making

in selections, appointments and promotions particularly in public sector institutions

is inconsistent with the concept of equality. In fact, as pointed out repeatedly by

numerous erudite judges, ‘arbitrariness is the anathema of equality’. In India’s

former Chief Justice Bhagwati’s words, ‘equality and arbitrariness are sworn

enemies.

In my view, principally, schemes for the selection, appointment and promotion of

persons for employment positions should contain mechanisms enabling the selection

of the most suitable person for the relevant position, whilst embodying the principle

of equality. The objective sought to be achieved by doing so, is the imposition of

compulsion on persons in authority who are empowered to take decisions relating to

selections, appointments, recruitment and promotions, to arrive at objective and 19 SC (FR) Application No. 256/2017 SC minutes 11th December 2020.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 35

reasonable decisions, and thereby securing protection against arbitrary decision-

making.

The above pronouncement made by Justice Kodagoda P.C. clearly demonstrates that

the policy-decisions of the authorities in terms of the appointments and promotions

of public officers should be always done subject to the doctrine of equality while

suppressing arbitrariness and unreasonableness which might otherwise inherently

prevent the selection of the most eligible person for a particular designation.

Apart from that, in the same judgment, it was held that “Once such schemes are

promulgated, it is equally important and necessary to ensure that, they are enforced

correctly, comprehensively, uniformly, consistently and objectively”.

Most significantly, it must be reiterated that, as proclaimed by Justice Padman

Surasena, in Saman Rathnayake (Supra) case, “This Court cannot ignore the

seniority of the serving police officers and give directions to promote officers who

are less senior merely because the political victimization committee had

recommended to do so. The Supreme Court cannot be, and should not become, a

mere rubber stamp to endorse any such recommendation of a political victimization

committee.”

In light of the foregoing reasons, I see no legitimate basis for the Respondents to

backdate the promotion of the 48th Respondent to January 1, 2014, from February 8,

2020 the date on which he was initially promoted to the rank of Chief Inspector of

Police alongside the Petitioners. Moreover, the Respondents have not provided any

justification for their action. Consequently, the 48th Respondent who was in par with

Petitioners should not be allowed to be promoted over the Petitioners in the

aforementioned manner.

Hence, it is my considered view that the arbitrary and unwarranted alteration has

directly infringed upon the Petitioner’s Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article

12(1) of the Constitution.

SC/FRA/0045/2022 36

Violation of Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Article 14(1)(g) of the 1978 Constitution guarantees every citizen the general right to

engage in a profession, trade, or employment of their choice. However, this provision

does not extend to grant an individual the right to a specific job or appointment to a

particular position of their choice. For clarity, the text of Article 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution is reproduced below:

Article 14 (1)(g) - “Every citizen is entitled to the freedom to engage by himself or in

association with others in any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or

enterprise;”

It is a well-established principle that the right to "profession" inherently encompasses

the opportunity for “legitimate promotions”. Especially, when it is enacted that

“every citizen is entitled (…) to engage (…) in association with others in any lawful

(…) profession,” this includes the right to be considered for promotion alongside

contemporaries in similar circumstances.

For a comprehensive and comparative analysis, it is pertinent to examine the

Constitution of India20, which enshrines provisions that ensure equal opportunity for

all citizens in matters related to employment or appointment to any office under the

State. Specifically, Article 16(1) of the Indian Constitution, which is the

corresponding provision of Article 14(1)(g) of the Sri Lankan Constitution upholds

this right, providing as follows:

Article 16(1) - “There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters

relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State”

The above Article has been judicially interpreted by the Indian Supreme Court in

several occasions. One of them would be in the case of Ajit Singh and others v. State

20 The Constitution of India, 1950

SC/FRA/0045/2022 37

of Punjab and others.21This particular case defined the word ''employment'' to

include “promotions” within its ambit as follows:

“Article 16(1) provides to every employee otherwise eligible for promotion

or who comes within the zone of consideration, a fundamental right to be

"considered" for promotion. Equal opportunity here means the right to be

"considered" for promotion. If a person satisfies the eligibility and zone

criteria but is not considered for promotion, then there will be a clear

infraction of his fundamental right to be "considered" for promotion, which is

his personal right. "Promotion" based on equal opportunity and 'seniority'

attached to such promotion are facets of fundamental right under Article

16(1).”

In the Sri Lankan constitution, unlike in the Indian context, the right to equality

and the right to engage in profession have been laid down in two different

Articles, respectively in Article 12 (1) and Article 14(1)(g).Therefore, when

determining the legitimacy of a promotion granted to a public officer, the Court

should read Article 14(1)(g) in concurrence with Article 12(1) of the Constitution

in order to give effect to the meaningful interpretation of the Article 14(1)(g).

Because, both these Articles are intrinsically interconnected. Therefore, a

violation of Article 12(1) due to the denial of rightful promotions, as in the

present case, would inevitably result in a breach of Article 14(1)(g) as well.

Therefore, based on the arguments and materials presented above, I am convinced

that the Petitioners have established a violation of their Fundamental Rights under

Article 14(1)(g).

Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the Petitioners are entitled to succeed their application

and entitled to the following reliefs.
