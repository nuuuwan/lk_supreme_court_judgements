A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

1. The question that arises in this case is whether a settlement

reached between a Plaintiff and a Defendant in a previous rei

vindicatio action can bind a third party who acquired rights from

the Defendant prior to the settlement. A further question is

whether the decree recording the settlement in that previous rei

vindicatio action can operate as res judicata in a subsequent action

filed by the third party against the Plaintiff in the earlier case.

There are other notable issues of civil law raised by this case, but

these are best appreciated once the factual background which is

engulfed in the two actions concerning the same subject matter is

set out.

2. The subject matter in question is a parcel of land known as Lot 1

of a larger land. I would first deal with the 1st case and thereafter

dwell on the 2nd case which has given rise to this appeal.

P a g e 7 | 17

The first case concerning Lot 1: Noor Mohamed v. Saman

Bandara

3. The first action concerns a claim brought by Noor Mohamed (the

Plaintiff in that case) against Saman Bandara (the Defendant),

alleging obstruction of possession in respect of Lot 1, a portion of

land formerly owned by Saman Bandaras grandfather, William

Dias, as far back as the 1930s.

4. Noor Mohamed had bought Lot 1 from Ida Claris -an intestate heir

of William Dias and whether Ida being one of the six intestate heirs

of William Dias was the owner of the entirety of Lot1 when she sold

Lot 1 to Noor Mohamed is another question that arises in this

appeal but I will address this in the course of this judgment. Suffice

it to say at the moment that Saman Bandara was a son of Ida

Claris who has also disposed of his interest in Lot 1.

5. At the outset, it is appropriate to set out a chronological account of

the material facts, which also illustrates the sequence of events

that led to the creation of Lot 1 from the larger land.

6. Upon the death of William Dias in 1937, the larger land devolved

on his intestate heirs: his widow, Dolphi Perera, and five children.

The widow inherited a half share, while the five children each

acquired a one-tenth (1/10) share.

P a g e 8 | 17

7. The heirs subsequently subdivided the larger land into five lots.

There is evidence that from 1968, one of the children, Ida Claris,

took up occupation of Lot 1. This subdivision took place on

28.11.1968 by way of a plan bearing No 815/A.

Deed of Declaration dated 8th October 1979

8. Though the land was subdivided into lots 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, the

intestate heirs of William Dias-Dolphy Perera (the widow), Vincent

Dias, Cyril Dias, Beatrice Dias, Dunstan Dias and Ida Dias (the

five children of William Dias) made a deed of declaration on

8.10.1979 and thus, declared themselves as owners of the

subdivided lots. In other words, all the heirs of William Dias-the

widow and the 5 children inclusive of Ida recognized and

acknowledged themselves as co-owners of the larger land.

Conveyance of Lot 1 by Ida to one Noor Mohamed in 1980

9. Just one year afterwards, i.e. on 2nd April 1980, Ida conveyed Lot

1 to Noor Mohamed who is the Defendant-Respondent in this

appeal before us. He became the Plaintiff in the first case by virtue

of this conveyance. The extent of Lot 1 is 28.9 perches and it is

crystal clear that in view of the recognition of co-ownership by all

the heirs in the deed of declaration, Lot 1 which Ida conveyed to

Noor Mohamed has to be necessarily co-owned, as there is nothing

in the record before us to indicate that the other heirs have

relinquished their interests in Lot 1.

P a g e 9 | 17

10. While discussing the first case, let me also state that the effect of

co-ownership over Lot 1 has not been borne in mind by both the

District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court Judge having

regard to the present appeal before us. Be that as it may, so much

for the conveyance of the entirety of Lot 1 by Ida to Noor Mohamed

in 1980.

11. Upon the disposition of the entirety of Lot 1 to Noor Mohamed in

April 1980 by deed No 40, Noor Mohamed commenced possession

of Lot 1 and it has to be recalled that although Ida transferred the

entirety of Lot 1 to Noor Mohamed, the said conveyance was

behind the back of Idas mother and her 4 siblings. Since Ida had

declared her co-ownership in the deed of declaration of 1979, it

follows that Ida would have had just 1/10th share of Lot 1, whilst

the other heirs had 9/10th of Lot 1. But the fact remains that Ida

chose to sell the entirety to lot 1 and the nemo dat non habet

doctrine would entail that Noor Mohamed, if at all, secured by way

of the transfer deed No 40 just 1/10th of lot 1.

12. On the proved facts, Noor Mohamed became a co-owner of Lot 1

along with the mother of Ida and Idas 4 siblings.

13. The mother died intestate on 29 August 1984. Upon her demise,

her one-half share in Lot 1 devolved equally upon her five

children, each inheriting a one-tenth (1/10th) share in the entirety

of Lot 1. As a result, Ida, who had previously held a one-tenth

(1/10th) share in Lot 1, acquired an additional one-tenth (1/10th)

P a g e 10 | 17

share by way of succession from her mother. Accordingly, her total

interest in Lot 1 became two-tenths (2/10th or 1/5th).

14. As previously stated, Ida's conveyance of Lot 1 to Noor Mohamed

in 1980 occurred prior to the death of her mother on 29 August

1984. At the time of that conveyance, Ida held only a one-tenth

(1/10th) undivided share in Lot 1. Nonetheless, she purported to

convey the entirety of Lot 1 to Noor Mohamed. Following the

demise of the mother, Ida inherited an additional one-tenth

(1/10th) share by way of intestate succession. Applying the

principle of exceptio rei venditae et traditae, this subsequently

acquired interest would also enure to the benefit of Noor

Mohamed. Consequently, Noor Mohameds total entitlement in

Lot 1 amounts to two-tenths (2/10th), or one-fifth (1/5th), of the

property.

15. In the final analysis, Noor Mohamed remains a co-owner of Lot

1, holding an undivided one-fifth (1/5th) share alongside the

surviving siblings of Ida. This shared ownership arises from the

inevitable passage of time and the mothers crossing of lifes

threshold in 1984.

16. It is not lost on this Court that Mr.Manohara de Silva PC quite

adroitly contended that Ida had the entirety of Lot 1, if one applied

the doctrine of the collation or hotchpot. In response, Mr.

Kushan DAlwis, Presidents Counsel, firmly rejected this

position, contending that the doctrine is wholly inapplicable to the

present factual matrix. I shall return to this issue in due course.

P a g e 11 | 17

17. As I have enunciated as above, it would appear that Ida would

have inherited 1/5th share of Lot 1 upon the death of the mother

and I am irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that Idas siblings

did have co-ownership over Lot 1 along with Noor Mohamed.

18. This conclusion would be rebutted by evidence of an overt act on

the part of Noor Mohamed and any adverse possession on the part

of Noor Mohamed vis--vis the other co-owners has to be found as

a fact in the second case filed over the same subject matter, which

was a partition suit.

19. However, the second casea partition action in which these

issues were centralwas dismissed by the District Judge of

Colombo on the ground that the land was incapable of being

partitioned. The dismissal was based on several factors, including

the finding that co-ownership had never devolved upon the

Plaintiff in that case, Nalika Jeewanthi. I respectfully disagree

with this conclusion. Saman Bandaras co-ownership rights over

Lot 1, which he acquired as a gift from his uncles and aunt, should

have lawfully devolved upon his vendee, Nalika Jeewanthi the

Plaintiff in the second case the partition suit.

20. Prior to the transfer of 20 perches of Lot 1 to the said Nalika

Jeewanthi, Saman Bandara-the son of Ida had received the

interests of his uncles and aunty over Lot 1 by way of a gift made

to him by the said uncles and aunty on 12/12/1997.

P a g e 12 | 17

21. There were developments after this gift was made. Saman

Badara began to disturb Noor Mohamed in his possession and it

is in the circumstances that Noor Mohmed filed an action for rei

vindicatio against Saman Bandara.

22. But this 1st case never went to trial as it resulted in a settlement

between Noor Mohamed and Saman Bandara who is the son of

Ida.

Settlement in the 1st case

23. The settlement was reached between Noor Mohamed and Saman

Bandara on 18.12,1998. One of the terms of settlement was that

Saman Bandara agreed to institute a partition action within 6

months. During the pendency of this action and prior to the

settlement in the District Court in December 1998, Saman

Bandara had transferred his title to a part of Lot 1 on 11.03.1998

to Nalika Jeewanthi -the Plaintiff in the latter action. It has to be

remembered that Nalika Jeewanthi attempted to intervene in the

case but was unsuccessful.

24. Having transferred his interest to Nalika Jeewanthi in 11th

March 1998, it strikes this Court that Saman Bandara entered

into the aforesaid settlement in December 1998. I hasten to point

out that the settlement cannot bind the vendee Nalika Jeewanthi

as she was not a party to the settlement. The six-month limitation

that Saman Bandara set in the settlement to file a partition action

against Noor Mohamed was behind the back of his vendee and it

P a g e 13 | 17

would be inequitable to hold that a vendee should be bound by the

settlement which the vendor effected in court without any kind of

intimation or participation on the part of the vendee to the said

settlement. Since Saman Bandara had already parted with his

interest to Nalika Jeewanthi, he had no interest to partition

before the expiry of 6 months and he did not do so. However,

Nalika Jeewanthi who was unsuccessful in entering into the first

case file the partition action which is the 2nd suit.

2nd Partition suit

25. The partition action filed by the vendee, Nalika Jeewanthi, was

dismissed by the District Court on 20.10.2004. I have already

concluded that Nalika Jeewanthi was entitled to institute the

partition action, as she had acquired co-ownership rightsif any

through her vendor, Saman Bandara. However, whether Saman

Bandara himself had lawfully obtained an interest in Lot 1 from

his uncles and aunt was a matter that the learned District Judge

did not examine in extenso.

26. The failure of Saman Bandara to initiate a partition action within

six months has been imputed to Nalika Jeewanthi, the Plaintiff.

Such an approach is impermissible, as Saman Bandara's omission

does not bind Nalika Jeewanthi, his vendee. Furthermore, the

question of whether Noor Mohmed had ousted the other co-

ownersthe uncles and aunt, who were Saman Bandara's

predecessors in titlereceived inadequate consideration in both

the District Court and the Civil Appellate Court.

P a g e 14 | 17

27. Thus, the settlement decree in the 1st case cannot operate as res

judicata so as to prevent the 2nd action. The learned Judges of the

Civil Appellate Court by the judgment dated 16.03.2012 dismissed

the appeal of Nalika Jeewanthi.

28. Having regard to the settlement reached between Noor Mohamed

and Saman Bandara in the 1st action, the learned judges of the

High Court allude to the case of Talagune v De Livera1 and

endorse the long held principle that rights of the parties must be

determined at the time of action and thus, the decision made on

the settlement in the first case would relate to the date of the plaint

in the partition action. It has to be borne in mind that the decision

made in the 1st case was not made on merits. It was a decision

made on a settlement.

29. One cannot relate rights emanating from that settlement and

impute it as rights inherent to Nalika Jeewanthi -the Plaintiff in

the partition action. First, Nalika Jeewanthi was not a party to the

settlement. Saman Bandara could not have entered into a

settlement so as to wipe out Nalika Jeewanthis right, if any in Lot

1. I cannot hold that the long held principle that rights of parties

relate back to the date of the plaint would apply in full force to a

case where a settlement is effected especially when that settlement

is not on merits and no rights emanate from that settlement

binding a third-party such as Nalika Jeewanthi.

1 (1997) 1 Sri LR 253

P a g e 15 | 17

30. In the circumstances, the dismissal of Nalika Jeewanthis appeal

in the High Court is erroneous.

31. Before I part with the judgment, I must refer to collation or

hotchpot which was advanced on behalf of the Defendant-

Respondent before this Court-Noor Mohamed. The Court

appreciates the full force of that argument but in my view, it would

not apply to the facts of this case.

Collation or Hotchpot

32. Section 35 of the Matrimonial Rights and Inheritance Ordinance

No. 15 of 1876 as amended states that, Children or grandchildren

by representation becoming with their brothers and sisters heirs

to the deceased parents are bound to bring into hotchpot or

collation all that they have received from their deceased parents

above the others either on the occasion of their marriage or to

advance or establish them in life, unless it can be proved that the

deceased parent, either expressly or impliedly, released any

property so given from collation.

33. This provision no doubt altered the law as regards liability to

collation, but it did not give a new meaning to the expression bring

into hotchpot or collation, which was a term of art that was

already known to the common law. Moreover, it may well happen

that where some of the children are liable to collation, all that they

have received from their deceased parents above the others is not

P a g e 16 | 17

represented by any specific parcel or parcels of land or any other

specific thing, and that the excess can be brought into collation

only by bringing its value into account. It seems that the context of

the expression bring into hotchpot or collation in the section

confirms rather than negatives the view that the legislation did not

intend to take away the heirs option to discharge a 1iability to

collation by bringing the value of the property into account.

34. The clear implication of this provision is that two classes of gifts

are now liable to collation, namely, (a) those given on the occasion

of marriage, and (b) those given to advance or establish children in

life, unless it appears either expressly or impliedly that it was

intended that they should be released from that liability.

35. None of these issues were ever raised in the partition suit and

thus, the question of collation did not receive any consideration in

the courts below.

36. From the foregoing analysis, it is quite clear that the partition

action was not conducted with a view to ascertaining the rights of

parties having regard to the established legal principles and thus,

the central questions of co-ownership and ouster, if they arise in

the case, have not been properly addressed and this case suffers

for want of investigation. In the circumstances, I take the view that

rights of parties to co-ownership and the inconvenience if any of

continuing such relationship must be examined afresh.

P a g e 17 | 17

37. I thus set aside the judgments of the District Court dated 20th

October 2004 and the Civil Appellate Court dated 16th March 2012

in the partition action and proceed to answer the questions of law

raised on behalf of the Plaintiff-Appellant before this Court in the

affirmative. Accordingly, I order a retrial on the same pleadings

and evidence must be taken from the respective parties and their

privies in afresh order to resolve questions of co-ownership over

Lot 1 and decide whether the said Lot 1 should be partitioned or

not.

38. We direct the learned District Judge, Colombo to accord priority

to this case and conclude it as expeditiously as it should.
