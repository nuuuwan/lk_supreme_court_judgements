"30.  In the circumstances, the dismissal of Nalika Jeewanthi’s appeal"
"in the High Court is erroneous."
"31.  Before  I  part  with  the  judgment,  I  must  refer  to  collation  or"
"hotchpot  which  was  advanced  on  behalf  of 
the  Defendant-"
"Respondent

The  Court"
"appreciates the full force of that argument but in my view, it would"
"not apply to the facts of this case."

"No. 15 of 1876 as amended states that, “Children or grandchildren"
"by representation becoming with their brothers and sisters heirs"
"to  the  deceased  parents  are  bound  to  bring 
into  hotchpot  or"
"collation  all that they have received from their deceased parents"
"above  the  others  either  on  the  occasion  of  their  marriage  or  to"
"advance or establish them in life, unless it can be proved that the"
"deceased  parent,  either  expressly  or 
impliedly,  released  any"
"property so given from collation”."
"33.  This  provision  no  doubt  altered  the  law  as  regards  liability  to"
"collation, but it did not give a new meaning to the expression “bring"
"into  hotchpot  or  collation”,  which  was  a  term  of  art  that  was"
"already known to the common law. Moreover, it may well happen"
"that where some of the children are liable to collation, “all that they"
"have received from their deceased parents above the others” is not"
