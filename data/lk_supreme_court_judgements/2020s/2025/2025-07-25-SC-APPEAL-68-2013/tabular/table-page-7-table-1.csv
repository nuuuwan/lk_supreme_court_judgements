"The  first  case  concerning  Lot  1:  Noor  Mohamed  v.  Saman"
"Bandara"
"3.  The first action concerns a claim brought by Noor Mohamed (the"
"Plaintiff  in  that  case)  against  Saman  Bandara  (the  Defendant),"
"alleging obstruction of possession in respect of Lot 1, a portion of"
"land  formerly  owned  by  Saman  Bandaraâ€™s  grandfather,  William"
"Dias, as far back as the 1930s."
"4.  Noor Mohamed had bought Lot 1 from Ida Claris -an intestate heir"
"of William Dias and whether Ida being one of the six intestate heirs"
"of William Dias was the owner of the entirety of Lot1 when she sold"
"Lot  1  to  Noor  Mohamed  is  another  question  that  arises  in  this"
"appeal but I will address this in the course of this judgment. Suffice"
"it  to  say  at  the  moment  that  Saman  Bandara  was  a  son  of  Ida"
"Claris who has also disposed of his interest in Lot 1."
"5.  At the outset, it is appropriate to set out a chronological account of"
"the  material  facts,  which  also  illustrates  the  sequence  of  events"
"that led to the creation of Lot 1 from the larger land."
"6.  Upon the death of William Dias in 1937, the larger land devolved"
"on his intestate heirs: his widow, Dolphi Perera, and five children."
"The  widow  inherited  a  half  share,  while  the  five  children  each"
"acquired a one-tenth (1/10) share."
