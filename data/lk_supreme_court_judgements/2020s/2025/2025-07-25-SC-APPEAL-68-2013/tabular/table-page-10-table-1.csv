"share by way of succession from her mother. Accordingly, her total"
"interest in Lot 1 became two-tenths (2/10th or 1/5th)."
"14. As previously stated, Ida's conveyance of Lot 1 to Noor Mohamed"
"in 1980 occurred prior to the death of her mother on 29 August"
"1984. At  the  time of that  conveyance,  Ida  held only a one-tenth"
"(1/10th) undivided share in Lot 1. Nonetheless, she purported to"
"convey  the  entirety  of  Lot  1  to  Noor  Mohamed.  Following  the"
"demise  of  the  mother,  Ida 
inherited  an  additional  one-tenth"
"(1/10th)  share  by  way  of 
intestate  succession.  Applying  the"
"principle  of  exceptio  rei  venditae  et  traditae,  this  subsequently"
"acquired 
interest  would  also  enure 
to 
the  benefit  of  Noor"
"Mohamed.  Consequently,  Noor  Mohamed’s  total  entitlement  in"
"Lot 1 amounts to two-tenths (2/10th), or one-fifth (1/5th), of the"
"property."
"15. In the final analysis, Noor Mohamed remains a co-owner of Lot"
"1,  holding  an  undivided  one-fifth 
(1/5th)  share  alongside  the"
"surviving siblings of Ida. This shared ownership arises from the"
"inevitable  passage  of  time  and  the  mother’s  crossing  of  life’s"
"threshold in 1984."
"16. It is not lost on this Court that Mr.Manohara de Silva PC quite"
"adroitly contended that Ida had the entirety of Lot 1, if one applied"
"the doctrine of the collation or hotchpot.  In response, Mr."
"Kushan  D’Alwis,  President’s  Counsel, 
firmly 
rejected 
this"
"position, contending that the doctrine is wholly inapplicable to the"
"present factual matrix. I shall return to this issue in due course."
