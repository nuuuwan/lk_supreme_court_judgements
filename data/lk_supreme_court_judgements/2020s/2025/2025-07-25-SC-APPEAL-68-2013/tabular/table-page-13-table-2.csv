"2nd Partition suit"
"25.  The partition action filed by the vendee, Nalika Jeewanthi, was"
"dismissed  by  the  District  Court  on  20.10.2004.  I  have  already"
"concluded  that  Nalika  Jeewanthi  was  entitled  to  institute  the"
"partition action, as she had acquired co-ownership rights—if any—"
"through  her  vendor,  Saman  Bandara.  However,  whether  Saman"
"Bandara himself had lawfully obtained an interest in Lot 1 from"
"his uncles and aunt was a matter that the learned District Judge"
"did not examine in extenso."
