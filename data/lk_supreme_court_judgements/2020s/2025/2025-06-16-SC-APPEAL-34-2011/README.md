A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J

1. This case raises an important question in labour law: whether the Directors of a

Company who otherwise and voluntarily assumes the Company’s liability by

admission may subsequently resile from such assumption in proceedings

culminating in this appeal. The factual matrix surrounding this matter, which

now falls for consideration before this Court, warrants careful examination.

2. The liability that is now sought to be impugned arose in the following manner.

There was an application made by the 2nd Respondent Company (Cupid Industries)

to the Commissioner of Labour to terminate the services of 134 employees in 1995.

The Appellants in this case were Directors of the 2nd Respondent Company, whose

line of business was in the apparel industry for the export market. At the end of

an inquiry the Commissioner of Labour determined that a sum of Rs. 3,431,880

must be paid to the said employees on or before 30 September 1995.

3. The Company failed to honour this payment obligation imposed by the

Commissioner of Labour. Instead, the determination of the Commissioner was

challenged in a writ application bearing No. 773/96 which was however dismissed

by the Court of Appeal. Special leave to appeal was refused by the Supreme Court

in SC/SPL/LA/505/96.

4. Thus, the determination of the Commissioner of Labour to pay compensation

remained an outstanding obligation which was not met even by May 1997. As a

result, on 23 April 1998 Magistrate’s Court proceedings were initiated by the

Commissioner of Labour on the basis that the Company and its Directors had

committed an offence under Section 7 of the Termination of Employment

Workmen (Special Provisions) Act No.45 of 1971 (TEWA). This was an

application made to the Magistrate’s Court of Mount Lavinia for the recovery of

the sums ordered in April 1998.

9

5. The Company was asked to show cause by 19 June 1998. It is a salient feature of

this case that one day before the show cause date namely 18 June 1998 winding

up proceedings were filed in relation to the Company in the District Court of

Colombo.

6. On 19 June 1998 – the day on which the Directors were asked to show cause they

moved for time to file written submissions. It has to be noted that though the

winding up application had been made in the District Court on 18 June 1998, it

was not notified to the Magistrate on 19 June 1998. The existence of a winding up

application was brought home to the Magistrate for the first time only in the

written submissions filed on 14 August 1998.

7. The Magistrate, after having afforded the Appellant Directors an opportunity to

show cause at the aforesaid inquiry, made order on 3 September 1999 (marked

P2), finding the accused guilty of the offence. The Magistrate imposed

compensation in the nature of a fine and further imposed a default sentence of

imprisonment.

8. In other words, the learned Magistrate sentenced each director to a term of one

year's simple imprisonment in default of payment of compensation. This order was

made in terms of Section 9 of TEWA. The said provision reads as follows;

Section 9 – Special provisions in respect of offences committed by

bodies of persons.

Where any offence under this Act is committed by a body of persons, then—

(a) if the body of persons is a body corporate, every director and officer of

that body corporate shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence;

(b) if the body of persons is a firm, every partner of the firm shall be

deemed to be guilty of that offence;

10

(c) if body of persons is a trade union, every officer of that union shall be

deemed to be guilty of that offence; and

(d) if the body of persons is a body, unincorporate other than a firm or a

trade union, the President, Manager, Secretary and every officer of that

body shall each be deemed to be guilty of that offence:

Provided, however, that no such person shall be deemed to be guilty of an

offence under this Act if he proves that the offence was committed without

his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent the

commission of that offence.

9. It has to be observed that the Directors themselves were found guilty of the offence

on 3 September 1999 and this order of the Magistrate exposed the Appellant

Directors to a default sentence of imprisonment.

The first revision application to the High Court.

10. The Directors moved the High Court of the Western Province against the

Magistrate’s order but the High Court affirmed this order and rejected the revision

application filed by the Appellant Directors on 7 January 2002 – P3. In other

words, the Magistrate’s order dated 3 September 1999 (P2) was affirmed by the

High Court on 7 January 2002 by P3.

11. In the course of his order the learned High Court judge stated inter alia as follows;

The accused appeared in Court on 23.4.1998. The accused was asked

to show cause on or before 19.6.1998. The winding-up proceedings

were filed one day before 19th, namely on 18.6.1998 in the District

Court. On 19.6.1998 the accused moved for time to file written

submissions without any reference to the winding up case filed. In the

written submissions filed on 14.8.1998 the accused informed Court for

11

the first time that 5138/Spl had been filed to wind up the accused

company and moved to stay the action under Section 259 of the

Companies Act.

On the above facts, it becomes apparent that this winding up

action was a frivolous action filed merely to defeat the purpose

of the law….

12. Thus, one could reiterate the aforesaid timelines. The order of the

Commissioner to pay compensation was made on 18 September 1995. The

Company was asked to pay on or before 30 September 1995. The attempt to

challenge the determination of the Commissioner went all the way to the

Supreme Court and the attempt proved abortive with the Supreme Court

refusing leave in 1997.

13. In the end, the Commissioner caused the Company and its Directors to be

summoned before the Magistrate’s Court for the purpose of enforcing

compliance with his order. Upon inquiry, the Magistrate found them guilty

of non-compliance and proceeded to make order accordingly on 3 September

1999. The order was one of conviction that resulted in a default term of

imprisonment (P2). That order was thereafter affirmed by the High Court

by its judgment dated 7 January 2002 (P3).

14. It is in this enforcement action in the Magistrate’s Court that the existence

of the winding up application which had been filed on 18 June 1998 was

brought to the notice of the Magistrate in the written submissions filed by

the Appellants on 14 August 1998. Thus, there was a suppression of this

winding up application when the accused first appeared in Court on 19 June

1998 to show cause and moved for time to file written submissions.

15. There should have been a disclosure of the winding up application on 19

June 1998, when in fact the winding up application had been made on 18

June 1998. The application to stay the enforcement proceedings in the

12

Magistrate’s Court was made quite strangely only in the written

submissions on 14 August 1998 – almost after the expiry of two months from

the date of the so-called winding up application.

Can the winding up proceedings stay the enforcement action in the

Magistrate’s Court?

16. Both the learned Magistrate and the High Court judge, Hon. Eric

Basnayake (as he then was) rejected the argument of the Directors that the

enforcement proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court should be stayed by

virtue of the winding up application made in the District Court.

17. This was the 1st revision application which the Directors attempted against

the enforcement proceedings. A winding up application filed just a day prior

to the date of show cause inquiry was invoked for the purpose of staying the

enforcement proceedings and the learned High Court judge describes it as

a frivolous action filed merely to defeat the purpose of the law.

18. Whether the institution of winding up proceedings by the Directors—

possibly set in motion with a view to deferring the payment of debts owed

to employees—could operate to stall the proceedings before the Magistrate’s

Court, which had culminated in an order of payment enforceable by

imprisonment for non-compliance, is a matter of some significance. This

issue, which recurs throughout the proceedings, will be addressed more

fully in the course of this judgment, as it pervades both the 2nd revision

application and the appeal presently before this Court.

19. The circumstances that gave rise to the 2nd revision application merit a brief

narrative, for they shed light on the procedural trajectory that has brought

this matter before us.

13

2nd revisionary application and the instant appeal before this Court.

20. I have already made reference to the 1st revisionary application wherein the

learned High Court judge Eric Basnayake rejected the application for a stay of the

enforcement proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court. He affirmed the Magistrate’s

order finding the accused guilty and the sentence of imprisonment of the Directors

for non-compliance with an obligation that was imposed on the Company as far

back 1995. As could be seen, It was on 3 September 1999 that the accused were

found guilty. When the 1st revisionary order made by Hon. Eric Basnayake was

remitted back to the Magistrate’s Court, the learned Magistrate issued summons

on the 1st Respondent Company, but by then it had closed its head office and

another firm was operating from the said address.

21. However, on 27 June 2003 the Commissioner of Labour tendered a list of Directors

of the Company and the learned Magistrate issued notice on the Directors (the

Appellants).

22. What is particularly striking to this Court is the conduct of the Appellant Directors

in response to the summons. When they appeared before the Court on 25 July 2003

and requested a two-week extension to settle the dues, this act clearly indicated

an unambiguous acknowledgment of their obligation to pay the employees. Such

a request amounts to an implicit acceptance of the Magistrate's order dated 3

September 1999, which had already been affirmed by the High Court in the 1st

revision application.

23. There was, therefore, a clear and unequivocal affirmation by the Directors of their

personal liability. Having thus acknowledged the liability—originally incurred as

far back as 1995 and later crystallized into a judicially enforceable order in 1999

consequent to their non-compliance—it is difficult to comprehend the propriety of

the Appellants' subsequent conduct. Notwithstanding their express admission, the

14

Appellants proceeded to file a 2nd revision application before the High Court of the

Western Province, seeking to impugn the very order that reflected their

acceptance of liability. This application was, quite correctly, refused by the High

Court Judge S. Srikandarajah (as he then was) on 6 August 2003.

24. Such conduct on the part of the Appellants—asserting liability in one forum and

thereafter seeking to challenge the same in another—cannot be countenanced. It

strikes at the integrity of the judicial process and, in my view, constitutes an abuse

of process. A party cannot be permitted to approbate and reprobate in the same

breath by affirming an obligation in one proceeding and disavowing it in another

before a superior Court – Allegans Contraria Non Est Audiendus – {He is not

to be heard who alleges things contrary to each other} and quoting a judgment,

Broom’s Legal Maxims illustrates the maxim in following words:

" We may for the present observe that it expresses, in other language,

the trite saying of Lord Kenyon, that a man shall not be permitted to

"blow hot and cold" with reference to the same transaction, or in at

different times, on the truth of each of the conflicting allegations,

according to the promptings of his private interest",1

25. Having failed in the 2nd revision application, the Appellants preferred an appeal

to the Court of Appeal and Justice Sisira de Abrew dismissed the appeal of the

Appellants holding inter alia as follows;

On 25.7.2003 when the learned Magistrate was going to

implement the order dated 3.9.1999 (P2), the petitioners

accepted the validity of the said order and moved for time to pay

the entire amount. Vide P8. The petitions having accepted the

validity of P2 before the learned Magistrate challenged the same

in these proceedings. In my view a party which accepts the

validity of a judicial order before a Court of Law, cannot later

1 11th Edition, p 115.

15

challenge the validity of the same before another Court. In

granting relief in a revision application, the Court must examine

the conduct of the petitioner. The Petitioners, on 25.07.2003,

having accepted the validity of the order marked P2 moved for

time to pay the amount stated in the said order. The learned

Magistrate granted time. But later they, in the High Court,

challenged the very order which granted them time. It is

therefore seen that the intention of the petitioners on 25.7.2003

was to hoodwink the Magistrate and obtain time to challenge

the order allowing their own application. The revision being a

discretionary remedy will not be available to a party who

displays this kind of conduct. This view is supported by the

judicial decision in Perera v. Peoples Bank BALJ 1995 part 1

page 12 wherein His Lordship GPS de Silva CJ held that:

“revision is a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the

petitioners is a matter which is intensely relevant for the

granting of such relief.”

For these reasons I hold that a party which attempted to

hoodwink a Court is not entitled to claim relief under

revisionary powers of this Court.

26. It is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal that this appeal was made to

this Court. The protracted and labyrinthine course that the payment

obligation — originally imposed by the Magistrate as far back as 1999 — has

taken through the nooks and crannies of the legal system is difficult to

articulate in a mere summation. It is for this reason that I have set out, at

the outset, a detailed narration of the factual background. The legal issues

that surface to the fore in this appeal cannot be meaningfully examined

without first disentangling the factual matrix from which they arise.

16

27. I now proceed to consider the legal issue that has resurfaced at multiple

stages in the course of these proceedings. The core of the contention centres

on the applicability of Sections 259 and 264 of the Companies Act, No. 17 of

1982, which constitute the substantive law governing the matter presently

before this Court.

Sections 259 and 264 of the Companies Act of 1982

28. The principal contention advanced by the Appellants is that Sections 259

and 264 of the Companies Act of 1982 operated to preclude the proceedings

against the Directors. The aforesaid provisions go as follows;

Section 259 –

At any time after the presentation of a winding up petition, and

before a winding up order has been made, the company, or any

creditor or contributory, may

(a) where any action or proceeding against the company is

pending in any Court in Sri Lanka, make an application to the

Court in which such action or proceeding is pending for a stay

of proceedings therein; and

(b) where any other action or proceeding is pending against the

company, make an application to the Court having jurisdiction

to wind up the company to restrain further proceedings in such

action or proceeding,

and the Court to which application is so made may, as the case

may be, stay or restrain the proceedings accordingly on such,

terms as it thinks fit

Section 264 –

When a winding up order has been made, or a provisional

liquidator has been appointed, no action or proceeding shall be

proceeded with or commenced against the company except by

17

leave of the Court, and subject to such terms as the Court may

impose.

29. Before one analyzes these two provisions to ascertain whether the winding

up application ipso facto precludes the action against the Company, the

material facts have to be borne in mind. The liability of the Directors (the

Appellants) came about via two sources. One, is the deeming provision found

in Section 8 of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special

Provisions) Act (TEWA) that deemed them guilty. The fact that the

institution of the winding up proceedings would not preclude the deeming

provision to come into operation was emphasized by the learned High Court

judge on 07.01.2002 when he dismissed the 1st revisionary application filed

by the Appellants (P3). In other words, the conviction of the Directors by

way of the deeming provisions (P2) was affirmed by the High Court judge in

P3. Put differently, P2 imposed personal liability on the Directors. Such an

imposition of personal liability cannot be assailed now as P2 has been

validated by P3. It has to be recalled that the winding up application was

described as frivolous and the corollary follows. This sham of an action could

not have precluded the personal liabilities of the Directors arising as it is

quite clear that the winding up applications filed by two persons, friendly

hands or otherwise has been dismissed by the High Court as a facade.

30. Secondly, there is another way in which the personal liability of the Directors

arose. In the first instance, the Magistrate Court imposed it on 03.09.1999

but in this instance of the 2nd way, the Directors themselves imposed the

liability on them by voluntarily assuming it in the course of the Magistrate’s

Court proceedings on 25.07.2003. These two sources constitute the

emergence of the personal liability of the Directors. In the overall emergence

of this personal liability, it is crystal clear that the existence of the winding

up application is not a relevant consideration. In other words, there was both

an imposition of personal liability as well as an assumption of personal

liability. Both arose after the institution of the winding up proceedings and

18

it is independent of the existence of the winding up proceedings.

31. In any event, what the two provisions of the Companies Act prohibit is the

continuation of an action against the Company but not against the Directors.

The liability in this case crystalized against the Directors regardless of the

filing of the winding up proceedings when the liability of the Company arose

as far back as 1995 and it became the liability of the Directors as from

03.09.1999. A voluntary assumption of this liability apart from the Court

imposed obligation occurred on 25.07.2003.

32. Sections 259 and 264 could not operate so as to nullify this liability as the

winding up application was a clever contrivance designed to keep at bay the

compensation that had been ordered as far back as 1995. In corporate law it

would be an abuse of process to organize the affairs of a Company if the cause

of action had arisen long before the organization of the affairs takes place. It

is quite clear that such an attempt partakes of an intention to defraud the

creditors and the winding up proceedings filed just before the Company was

due to show cause was a facade and a sham - Adams v. Cape Industries

Plc2.

33. I take the view that Section 264 only prohibits proceedings against the Company

and not against the Directors and as such is not of any aid to the Appellants.

However, in any event, it should be noted that at the time the order P2 was made

on 3 September 1999, a winding up order had not been made. As P4 demonstrates

the order was made only on 22 September 2003. Thus, at the time of P2, there was

no obligation on the part of the Magistrate to stay proceedings. P2 thus remains

unassailable (and indeed it has not been challenged in these proceedings). P2

embodying the conviction of the Directors and the consequent sentence against

them which was affirmed by P3, remains valid and effectual up to date.

2 1990 (Ch) 547

19

34. Accordingly, there is no error in the judgement of the Court of Appeal and the High

Court. I proceed to answer the questions of law in favour of the Respondents as

follows;

• Did the Learned Judges of the Court of Appeal and the High Court err in

law by failing to consider that the Attorney-at-Law on behalf of the 3rd and

4th Respondents at no time declined to pay the said monies but only informed

the Learned Magistrate that the Company was under liquidation and steps

would be taken to make such payments in terms of Order marked P2?

In view of our holding that the Company and the Directors were validly convicted and

their liability was imposed by judicial orders, it is irrelevant to consider the statement

made on behalf of the 3rd and 4th Respondents. Therefore, this question of law is answered

against the Appellants.

• Did the Learned Judges of the Court of Appeal and High Court err in Law

when their Lordships failed to consider as per section 264 of the Companies

Act, No. 17 of 1982 when a winding-up order has been made, or a provisional

liquidator has been appointed, no action or proceeding shall be proceeded

with or commenced against the company except by leave of the court, and

subject to such terms as the court may impose?

In view of our conclusion that S.264 of the Companies Act of 1982 will not prohibit an

action against the Directors as a result of the questionable nature of the winding up

proceedings, this question has to be answered in the negative.

• Did the Learned Judges of the Court of Appeal and the High Court err in

Law when their Lordships failed to consider that there has to be default on

the part of the Company prior to summoning of its Directors?

There was indeed a default on the part of the Company on 30 September 1995 that has

lasted up to date. The frivolity and façade of the winding up application did not effect a

20

suspension or defeasance of the liability of the Company and consequently the Directors

became liable when there was failure by the Company to meet its obligations towards

the employees. Both the Company and Directors were convicted and their conviction has

not been vacated by a superior Court. Thus, there was default on the part of the Company

and consequently there was a crystallization of the Directors’ liability. Therefore, this

question of law is answered against the Appellants.

• Did the Learned Judges of the Court of Appeal and High Court err in law

when they failed to correct errors on the face of the record in both revision

applications before the High Court and the Court of Appeal?

In view of the aforesaid holding, this question of law must be answered in the negative.

35. Having thus answered the questions of law, I affirm the judgements of both the

Court of Appeal and the High Court.

36. In addition, the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent raised three

preliminary objections chief among which is the non-maintainability of this appeal

he claimed would be the outcome as a result of the failure of the Appellants to

challenge the findings of the Court of Appeal on the conduct of the Appellants in

the revision application. It is true that the conduct of the Appellants in the 2nd

revision application was critiqued by the Court of Appeal as an attempt to

hoodwink the Magistrate. The learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that the

failure to challenge that finding disentitles the Appellants to maintain this Appeal

that flows from the 2nd revision application. I would agree that this preliminary

objection is entitled to succeed and in any event in view of the fact that we have

answered the questions of law against the Appellants we would not indulge in an

analysis of the preliminary objections.

37. In view of the long and protracted proceedings embarked upon by the Directors

which resulted in 134 employees being deprived of their compensation, this Court

21

deems it appropriate that it would serve the interest of justice that the Appellants

should be ordered to pay the sum of Rs. 3,431,880 with legal interest from

03.09.1999.

38. We affirm the judgements of the Courts below and proceed to dismiss the appeal

of the Appellants. The Commissioner of Labour is directed to recover the aforesaid

sum ordered in paragraph 37 and defray them without delay.

39. The Registrar is directed to dispatch the judgement to the relevant Court for

enforcement.
