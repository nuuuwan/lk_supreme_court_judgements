"2nd revisionary application and the instant appeal before this Court."
"20. I  have  already  made  reference  to  the  1st  revisionary  application  wherein  the"
"learned High Court judge Eric Basnayake rejected the application for a stay of the"
"enforcement proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court. He affirmed the Magistrate’s"
"order finding the accused guilty and the sentence of imprisonment of the Directors"
"for non-compliance with an obligation that was imposed on the Company as far"
"back 1995. As could be seen, It was on 3 September 1999 that the accused were"
"found guilty. When the 1st revisionary order made by Hon. Eric Basnayake was"
"remitted back to the Magistrate’s Court, the learned Magistrate issued summons"
"on  the  1st  Respondent  Company,  but  by  then  it  had  closed  its  head  office  and"
"another firm was operating from the said address."
