"Magistrate’s  Court  was  made  quite 
strangely 
only 
in 
the  written"
"submissions on 14 August 1998 – almost after the expiry of two months from"
"the date of the so-called winding up application."
"Can  the  winding  up  proceedings  stay  the  enforcement  action  in  the"
"Magistrate’s Court?"
"16. Both 
the 
learned  Magistrate  and 
the  High  Court 
judge,  Hon.  Eric"
"Basnayake (as he then was) rejected the argument of the Directors that the"
"enforcement  proceedings  in  the  Magistrate’s  Court  should  be  stayed  by"
"virtue of the winding up application made in the District Court."
"17. This was the 1st revision application which the Directors attempted against"
"the enforcement proceedings. A winding up application filed just a day prior"
"to the date of show cause inquiry was invoked for the purpose of staying the"
"enforcement proceedings and the learned High Court judge describes it as"
"a 
frivolous  action 
filed  merely 
to  defeat 
the  purpose 
of 
the 
law."
"18. Whether  the  institution  of  winding  up  proceedings  by  the  Directors—"
"possibly set in motion with a view to deferring the payment of debts owed"
"to employees—could operate to stall the proceedings before the Magistrate’s"
"Court,  which  had  culminated 
in  an  order  of  payment  enforceable  by"
"imprisonment  for  non-compliance,  is  a  matter  of  some  significance.  This"
"issue,  which  recurs  throughout  the  proceedings,  will  be  addressed  more"
"fully  in  the  course  of  this  judgment,  as  it  pervades  both  the  2nd  revision"
"application and the appeal presently before this Court."
"19. The circumstances that gave rise to the 2nd revision application merit a brief"
"narrative, for they shed light on the procedural trajectory that has brought"
"this matter before us."
