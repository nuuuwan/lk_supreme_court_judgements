"Article 11 has been violated, three general observations apply:",""
"I.","“The acts or conduct complained of must be qualitatively of a kind that a"
"","Court may take cognizance of. Where it is not so, the Court will not declare"
"","that Article 11 has been violated."
"II.","Torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment may take"
"","many forms, psychological and physical."
"III.","Having  regard  to  the  nature  and  gravity  of  the  issue,  a  high  degree  of"
"","certainty is required before the balance of probability might be said to tilt"
"","in favour of a petitioner endeavouring to discharge his burden of proving"
"","that  he  was  subjected 
to 
torture  or 
to  cruel, 
inhuman  or  degrading"
"","treatment.”"
