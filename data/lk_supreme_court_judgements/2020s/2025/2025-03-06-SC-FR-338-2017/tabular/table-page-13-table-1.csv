"It  is  an  absolute  fundamental  right  subject  to  no  restrictions  or  limitations"
"whatsoever. Every person in this country, be he a criminal or not, is entitled to"
"this  right  to  the  fullest  content  of  its  guarantee.  Constitutional  safeguards  are"
"generally  directed  against  the  State  and  its  organs.  The  police  force  being  an"
"organ of the State is enjoined by the Constitution to secure and advance this right"
"and  not  to  deny,  abridge  or  restrict  the  same  in  any  manner  and  under  any"
"circumstances. Just as much as this right is enjoyed by every member of the police"
"force, so is he prohibited from denying the same to others, irrespective of their"
"standing,  their  beliefs  or  antecedents.  It  is  therefore  the  duty  of  this  court  to"
"protect  and  defend  this  right  jealously  to  its,  fullest  measure  with  a  view  to"
"ensuring  that  this  right  which  is  declared  and  intended  to  be  fundamental  is"
"always kept fundamental and that the executive by its action does not reduce it to"
"a  mere  illusion.  This  court  cannot,  in  the  discharge  of  its  constitutional  duty,"
"countenance any attempt by, any police officer however high or low, to conceal"
"or distort the truth induced perhaps, by a false sense of police solidarity. The facts"
"of  this  case  have  revealed  disturbing  features  regarding  third  degree  methods"
"adopted  by  certain  police  officers  on  suspects  held  in  police  custody.  Such"
"methods can, only be described as barbaric, savage and inhuman. They are most"
"revolting to one's sense of human decency and dignity particularly at the present"
"time when every endeavour is being made to promote and protect human rights.”"

"“ … it seems to me that the concept of human dignity, which is the entitlement of"
