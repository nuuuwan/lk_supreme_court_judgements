"officers left the police station for an investigation. However, it is clear that when"
"the Petitioner was arrested by the Respondents, the team did not have even one set"
"of  handcuffs between them. The 1st Respondent averred in his Affidavit that when"
"he was searching the Petitioner, he found a hand grenade hanging from his trouser"
"belt. After that the Petitioner was arrested by the 1st Respondent and the team for"
"the  offence  of  possessing  a  hand  grenade  and  that  at  the  time  of  arrest  the"

"or confine the body of the person to be arrested unless there be a submission to"
"the -custody by word or action and shall inform the person to be arrested of the"
"nature of the charge or allegation upon which he is arrested.”"
"Police officers should respect the right of every person to be presumed innocent"
"until  proven  guilty  as  guaranteed  by  Article  13(5)  of  the  Constitution.  This"
"requirement  is  designed  to  provide  the  arrested  person  with  the  opportunity  to"
"challenge  the  arrest  promptly.  While  there  is  no  need  for  a  specific  form  or  a"
"detailed  description  of  the  charges,  it  is  essential  that  the  arrested  person  is"
"informed  in  straightforward,  non-technical  language  that  they  can  understand,"
"outlining  the  fundamental  legal  and  factual  grounds  for  their  arrest  as  soon  as"
"reasonably possible. Where a person is arrested on suspicion that he or she has"
"committed an offence, such suspicion must be reasonable. In Dumbell v. Roberts"
