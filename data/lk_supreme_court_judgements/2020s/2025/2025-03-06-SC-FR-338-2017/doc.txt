DECIDED ON : 06.03.2025

K. KUMUDINI WICREMASINGHE, J.

The Petitioner filed the instant application alleging that his Fundamental Rights

guaranteed by the Constitution were infringed by the 1st to 6th Respondents. After

considering the said application, the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed on

05.02.2018 for the alleged infringement of Article 11 and Article 12(1) of the

Constitution.

The Petitioner stated that the incident concerning this application occured on

11.09.2016 around 4.40 p.m., when the Petitioner went with one Chandika

Samantha, in Chandikas motor bicycle to find one Vitharana Gamage Gamini

who had borrowed the Petitioners motor bicycle to visit a friend. Having met

Gamini at Katapola Urubokka Street, in Kirulapone Junction of Beralapanathara

they stopped nearby and parked next to a shop on the said street. The Petitioner

further stated that Gamini parked a few feet away from where Chandika had

3

parked. Thereafter, the Petitioner mounted his motorcycle and both the Petitioner

and Chandika waited for Gamini who went to the nearby shop. For disclosure the

Petitioner stated that the motorcycles were parked beside the pavement of the

Urubokka Street which is a two way lane approximately 12 feet wide which can

sufficiently accommodate the passage of two vehicles without any inconvenience

to any party.

Photographic evidence explaining the above situations have been marked as P1(a)

and P1(b).

The Petitioner stated that shortly afterwards, the 3rd Respondent (whose identity

the Petitioner was unaware of at the time) arrived in a small white coloured van

and stopped behind Chandika's motorcycle. The 3rd Respondent shouted at

Chandika who was on his motorcycle to move his bike so that the van could

proceed. The Petitioner stated that the following altercation ensued afterwards;

a) Chandika explained to the 3rd Respondent that there was sufficient space for

him to move through without disturbing him;

b) The 3rd Respondent threatened Chandika and refused to proceed unless he

moved his motorcycle;

c) Thereafter, the 3rd Respondent confronted Chandika and insisted him to move

his motorcycle;

d) The Petitioner stated that having noticed that a congregation of people had

gathered around Chandika, the Petitioner arrived at the scene; in the ensuing

commotion anticipating that the 3rd Respondent was going to attack Chandika, the

Petitioner intervened and shoved the 3rd Respondent away which pacified any

further confrontation;

e) Thereafter, whilst returning to his motorcycle, he heard a sound of glass

shattering and turned around to find the 3rd Respondent with a stone in his hand

4

and the windscreen of the 3rd Respondent's vehicle was shattered.

The Petitioner stated that the 3rd Respondent walked away leaving his vehicle

behind and threatened the Petitioner, Chandika and Gamini, who had also arrived

by that time, by stating that they would have to suffer in jail for two weeks' time.

The Petitioner stated that in response, Chandika left to lodge a complaint in the

Urubokka Police Station. Chandika was unaccompanied in such endeavour and

left his motorcycle in the care of the Petitioner and Gamini. The Petitioner stated

that while waiting for Chandika, the 3rd Respondent arrived and remained next to

the Respondent's van. Shortly afterwards, two police officers of the Urubokka

Police arrived and one of them grabbed the Petitioner by the hand and forced him

into the back seat of the 3rd Respondent's van. The Petitioner specifically stated in

the Petition that no reasons were given to the Petitioner. Meanwhile, Gamini was

asked to come to the Urubokka police station which he did on Chandika's

motorcycle. Thereafter, the said company proceeded to the Urubokka Police

station. The Petitioner further stated that he called Chandika who was at the Police

station and informed him of the situation. The Petitioner stated that after he

arrived at the police station, at or around 6.10 p.m. Chandika and the Petitioner

were forced into a Police cell.

The Petitioner specifically stated that no reasons for such detention were given to

the Petitioner. The Petitioner is now aware that Gamini after parking Chandika's

motorcycle had left the Police station by this time. The Petitioner stated that after

about 30-40 minutes following the detention of the Petitioner and Chandika, the

1st Respondent OIC arrived at the police station accompanied by the 3rd and 4th

Respondents. The Petitioner stated that the 1st Respondent ordered the cell in

which the Petitioner and Chandika were detained to be opened and thereafter

assaulted them repeatedly on their chests with his fists and ordered the 2nd

Respondent and an unidentified officer to forcefully move them to a room inside

the 1st Respondent's office in the Police Station. None of the police officers who

were in the nearby vicinity including the 2nd Respondent intervened to prevent the

5

aforesaid assault.

The Petitioner stated that the following transpired whilst inside the

aforementioned room, which due to the harrowing nature and quick turn of events

are set out to the best of the Petitioner's recollection;

a) The 1st-4th Respondents with the aforementioned unidentified officer were

present.

b) The 1st Respondent directed the 2nd Respondent to bring him a pole; as

such the 2nd Respondent procured him a thick pole about three (3) feet in

length.

c) The Petitioner and Chandika were ordered to lie face down and to lift

their legs from the knees so that the soles of their feet were pointed outward:

Thereafter, the 1st Respondent OIC commenced beating the Petitioner and

Chandika repeatedly by bringing down the aforementioned pole on the soles

of the Petitioner and Chandika,

d) The Petitioner exhausted by the beating was unable to lift his feet any

longer; The 1st Respondent thereafter turned his wrath on Chandika and

continued assaulting him until he also could not lift his feet any longer, The

Petitioner further stated that the 2nd Respondent and the aforementioned

unidentified officer assisted the 1st Respondent assault Chandika by holding

his legs;

e) The Petitioner stated that the Petitioner's soles of the feet were swollen

due to the beating and the Petitioner was thoroughly exhausted and in

immense pain;

f) The Petitioner stated that after the assault described above, they were

ordered by the 1st Respondent to stand on their feet and jump. However,

neither the Petitioner nor Chandika was able to jump as directed but instead

collapsed in exhaustion and pain;

g) Being so assaulted in front of the 3rd and 4th Respondent further

humiliated the Petitioner causing intense humiliation from such agony.

6

The medico-legal report dated 13.09.2016 explains the evidence regarding the

above injuries.

The Petitioner stated that after the torture mentioned above, they were dragged

and put into the former cell from which the 1st Respondent OIC extracted them.

By this time the Petitioner was completely exhausted and was barely conscious.

The Petitioner had, at this point, been aware that Gamini, upon hearing the

screams of the Petitioner and Chandika, rushed to the police station. However,

Gamini was also detained after the 3rd Respondent informed the police that he had

been present during the incident where the Respondent's vehicle was damaged.

The Petitioner alleged that the 1st Respondent was acting under the influence or in

collusion with the 3rd Respondent. Furthermore, the Petitioner stated that later in

the evening, Chandika's wife and some members of his family visited the police

station and witnessed the situation of the Petitioner and Chandika.

The Petitioner stated that later in the evening of 11.09.2016, the Petitioner,

Chandika and Gamini, were taken in a police jeep accompanied by unidentified

police men to the Heegoda Government Hospital. At the said hospital the said

party was produced before Dr Ekanayake, the Medical Officer in charge. The

Petitioner further stated that a police officer who accompanied them to the

hospital instructed them to explain the cause of the injuries as a result of

"running". However, the Petitioner revealed the actual situation to the medical

officer. After receiving treatment they were taken back to the police station.

The Petitioner stated that around 2.55 a.m. on the following day [12.09.2016] the

Petitioner was dragged out of the cell by two unidentified officers and brought

before the 1st Respondent OIC. The following transpired afterwards;

The OIC had with him a bottle shaped object, the lid of which was covered by a

paper; the Petitioner was asked to smear his thumb with saliva and to keep his

thumb on paper, having refused to comply, one of the officers who dragged the

7

Petitioner out of the cell was asked to forcefully place the Petitioner's thumb on

paper; As such the Petitioner's thumb was placed thrice on paper and thereafter

the same thumb was immersed in an ink pad and the routine described was

repeated. Thereafter the Petitioner was returned to the cell.

The Petitioner stated that in the following morning on 12.09.2016 around 9.00

a.m. the Petitioner, Chandika and Gamini were taken again to the Heegoda

Government Hospital and were examined by the medical officer who treated them

during the previous night. The Petitioner further stated that the medical officer

instructed the Police officers to admit the Petitioner and Chandika to a hospital

immediately.

The Petitioner, Chandika and Gamini were produced before the Learned

Magistrate of Mrawaka on the same day [12.09.2016] around 11.30 a.m. as

accused in the case bearing number 39592. The Petitioner further states that he

was also accused separately in case No. 39596. Having perused the B-reports

submitted by the 1st Respondent in the said cases the following, inter alia, is

revealed;

In the case No. 39592, it is stated that the 3rd Respondent had been assaulted,

threatened and that his vehicle had also been damaged; thereafter, the 3rd

Respondent had visited the police station and lodged a complaint therein.

Consequent to such, the 1st Respondent had arrested the Petitioner, Chandika and

Gamini.

In the case No. 39596, the narration of facts leading to the arrest of the Petitioner

for a separate offence is found in B reports dated 12.09.2016 and 26.09.2016. The

said B-reports disclose that following a complaint made by the 3rd Respondent via

telephone of an assault, the 1st Respondent accosted the Petitioner who tried to

evade arrest with another person in a cab; upon inspection a hand grenade was

found on the Petitioner at which point the driver of the cab had driven away from

8

the area:

The Petitioner specifically stated that although the B report of case No. 39592

disclose the presence of the Chandika and Gamini with the Petitioner at the time

of arrest, the B reports in case No. 39596 do not disclose the presence of Chandika

and Gamini at the time of arresting the Petitioner, who purportedly had been with

another person. The Petitioner stated that where the Petitioner had been

purportedly arrested together with Chandika and Gamini as borne out by P4, there

cannot be a separate incident as borne out by P5 (a) and P5 (b) relating to the

same situation.

The Petitioner specifically stated that the foregoing narration borne out in P4 and

P5(a) and P5(b) is contradictory. Further, such B reports are contrary to the

narration of the Petitioner. The Petitioner specifically stated that such narration

by the 1st Respondent is fabricated for collateral purposes and steeped in mala

fides and amply demonstrates the arbitrary and adverse nature of the said

Respondent against the Petitioner.

The Petitioner stated that the Learned Magistrate in the aforementioned case made

the following remarks regarding the deplorable treatment meted out to the

Petitioner by the 1st Respondent and his officers as borne out by the journal entry

of the proceedings in the case No. 39592 on 12.09.2016, which is produced below;

....

.

The Petitioner stated that in the following morning (13.09.2016), the Petitioner

and Chandika were admitted to the Matara General Hospital whilst Gamini

remained in the Matara Prison. The Petitioner states that he obtained treatment in

the aforesaid hospital from 13.09.2016 up till 19.09.2016. Thereafter, on

19.09.2016 the Petitioner was returned to the Matara Prison. The Petitioner

9

specifically stated that he had not recuperated completely by this time. The

Petitioner stated that as borne out by P6 the Petitioner, Chandika and Gamini were

to be produced in an identification parade before the Learned Magistrate of

Morawaka on 20.09.2016. However, due to the absence of the 1st Respondent, the

Petitioner had to remain in prison for six (06) more days until 26.09.2016 until

the identification parade was held. The Petitioners contention is that the 1st

Respondent was willfully absent from court on 20.09.2016 in order to harass the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner stated that on 26.09.2016 the Petitioner, Chandika and Gamini

were produced before the Learned Magistrate of Morawaka and Chandika and

Gamini were released on bail. However, the Petitioner was refused bail due to the

charges of possession of a bomb in case No. 39596, and was detained further.

The Petitioner stated that he was granted bail only on 26.11.2016.

The Petitioner stated that after returning home, the Petitioner visited the office of

the Assistant Superintendent of Police (hereinafter referred to as ASP) in Matara

to submit a statement explaining the arbitrary arrest and the torture inflicted by

the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner stated that to date the Petitioner is unaware of

any actions taken by the ASP office regarding his complaint. The Petitioner stated

that consequent to a complaint to the National Police Commission of Southern

Province [hereinafter referred to as the NPC] about the assault by the 1st

Respondent, investigations were carried out and the Petitioner submitted

statements and evidence in proof of the assault of the 1st Respondent and his

officers. Thereafter, by letter dated 08.02.2017 the Petitioner was informed by the

Provincial Director of NPC of Southern Province that the investigation reports

have been submitted to the NPC unit in Colombo in order to take appropriate steps

against the 1st Respondent and his officers. However, the Petitioner is unaware of

any further action taken thereafter.

10

The Petitioner stated that he still continues to suffer from the injuries caused by

the 1st Respondent which occasionally inflame during work. The Petitioner further

stated that;

a) The repercussions of the assault has deprived him of his former employment;

b) The loss of his income has put an extra strain on his family members and they

are left to depend on the meager income earned by his wife.

In the Affidavit of the 1st Respondent, the Respondents have taken the following

preliminary objections. The Petitioner has suppressed and misrepresented material

facts as morefully pleaded and the Petitioners Application is time barred and

therefore the Petitioners Instant Application should be dismissed in limine.

The 1st Respondent denied the convictions of the Petitioner and labelled the

Petitioner as a habitual criminal who has at least 5 previous convictions and the

petitioner and his friend was influenced by alcohol. As per to the Written

Submission of the 1st Respondent, it stated that when the 1st Respondent was

inspecting the Petitioner, he found a hand grenade with him and about 6.30 p.m.

the Petitioner was arrested by the 1st Respondent for the offence of possession of

a hand grenade. Therefore, the 1st Respondent stated that the Petitioners arrest

was legal and within the procedure established by law.

Owing to the above, the Petitioner filed alleging violations of his fundamental

rights guaranteed under Article 11, Article 12(1), Article 13(1) and Article 13(2).

The Court has been granted leave on Article 11 and Article 12(1).

Having discussed the above sequences of events as narrated by both parties, I will

now consider the alleged infringement of the Fundamental Rights of the

Petitioner.

Article 11 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment.

11

This right is absolute and cannot be waived, applying to all individuals without

exception. The unequivocal nature of this right, coupled with its status as a

fundamental provision, unmistakably establishes the Constitution's stance of

absolute prohibition against any form of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

As stipulated above, the Petitioner stated that the 1st Respondent assaulted them

repeatedly on their chests with his fists and ordered the 2nd Respondent and an

unidentified officer to forcefully move them to a room inside the 1st Respondent's

office in the Police Station. According to the Petitioner, none of the police officers

who were in the vicinity including the 2nd Respondent intervened to prevent the

aforesaid assault.

Chandika's wife visited the police station and witnessed the situation of the

Petitioner and Chandika as per the written submission of the Petitioner (as

depicted in the affidavit as P2). Pathirage Karunawathi Perera (Chandikas wife)

through the Affidavit which stated that,

I state that in the police station I saw my husband and Shantha sprawled in a

police cell. I state that I saw that my husbands and Shanthas legs were swollen

and were bleeding, I further state that I saw Gamini in the same cell with them.

I further state that my husband was in immense pain and was barely conscious at

the relevant time.

The 1st Respondent has submitted document 1R19, which is claimed to be a

record of the Petitioners prior convictions. The Petitioner has not disputed the

existence of these convictions in their written submissions. However, it is

important to recognize that, regardless of the nature of an individuals criminal

history, law enforcement authorities, acting as officers of the State with significant

statutory powers, must exercise such powers in a manner that preserves the

12

inherent dignity of the individual. Even the worst criminals are entitled to dignity,

and it is imperative that police officers uphold and respect this principle.

The Court has given recognition to the right to human dignity.

As observed by Justice White in Wolff v. McDonnell [1974] (418 U.S. 539, 555-

6,

[A] prisoner is not wholly stripped of constitutional protections when he is

imprisoned for crime. There is no iron curtain drawn between the Constitution

and the prisons...

In the recent case of Rathnayake Tharanga Lakmali v. Niroshan Abeykoon

[SC FR 577/10 SC Minutes of 17.12.2019], at page 13 Thurairaja, PC, J

affirmed the principle that even suspects of serious crimes must be treated with

dignity.

The Fundamental Rights Chapter in our Constitution does not expressly refer to

a right to life. However, the Constitution, as a living document, should not be

construed in a narrow and pedantic sense. I am of the view that constitutional

interpretation should be informed by the values embodied in it. The preamble/

svasti of the Constitution recognises Dignity and Well-being of the People as a

fundamental value that should be furthered by assuring to all People FREEDOM,

EQUALITY, JUSTICE , FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS and the

INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. In my view, recognition of a right to

life is in furtherance of this fundamental value.(Emphasis Added)

In the case of Amal Sudath Silva v. Kodituwakku Inspector of Police and

Others [1987] 2 Sri LR 119, at Page 126-127 Athukorala J stated as follows,

Article 11 of our Constitution mandates that no person shall be subjected to

torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It prohibits

13

every person from inflicting torture some, cruel or inhuman treatment on another.

It is an absolute fundamental right subject to no restrictions or limitations

whatsoever. Every person in this country, be he a criminal or not, is entitled to

this right to the fullest content of its guarantee. Constitutional safeguards are

generally directed against the State and its organs. The police force being an

organ of the State is enjoined by the Constitution to secure and advance this right

and not to deny, abridge or restrict the same in any manner and under any

circumstances. Just as much as this right is enjoyed by every member of the police

force, so is he prohibited from denying the same to others, irrespective of their

standing, their beliefs or antecedents. It is therefore the duty of this court to

protect and defend this right jealously to its, fullest measure with a view to

ensuring that this right which is declared and intended to be fundamental is

always kept fundamental and that the executive by its action does not reduce it to

a mere illusion. This court cannot, in the discharge of its constitutional duty,

countenance any attempt by, any police officer however high or low, to conceal

or distort the truth induced perhaps, by a false sense of police solidarity. The facts

of this case have revealed disturbing features regarding third degree methods

adopted by certain police officers on suspects held in police custody. Such

methods can, only be described as barbaric, savage and inhuman. They are most

revolting to one's sense of human decency and dignity particularly at the present

time when every endeavour is being made to promote and protect human rights.

In Ajith C. S. Perera v. Minister of Social Services and Social Welfare and

Others [2019] 3 Sri LR 275, at page 301 Prasanna Jayawardena, PC, J mentioned

as follows

it seems to me that the concept of human dignity, which is the entitlement of

every human being, is at the core of the fundamental rights enshrined in our

Constitution. It is a fountainhead from which these fundamental rights spring forth

14

and array themselves in the Constitution, for the protection of all the people of the

country.

In Kandawalage Don Samantha Perera v. Officer in Charge, Hettipola Police

Station and Others [SC (FR) Application No. 296/2014; SC Minutes of

16.06.2020], at page 05 Thurairaja, PC, J referring to the above passage stated

that,

I am in respectful agreement with his Lordship that Human Dignity is a

constitutional value that underpins the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction of the

Supreme Court. I am of the view that Human Dignity as a normative value

should buttress and inform our decisions on Fundamental Rights.

Considering the facts of this case, physical torture against the Petitioner and

Chandika in the presence of the 3rd and 4th Respondent whilst the arrest and

detention, has been established by the Petitioners.

Learned Magistrate on 12.09.2016 has observed that the Petitioner was in

immense discomfort (as depicted in the P6):

1 . 1

.

. .

According to the Petition, the Medical Officer in charge (Dr.

G.D.K.K.Ekanayake) of Urubokka Regional hospital has observed that the

Petitioner was in pain and discomfort at the time he was produced to the doctor

by police and that the Petitioner complained of pain in his feet.

15

-:

. .

.

As per the Medical Report of the Medical Officer in charge (Dr.

G.D.K.K.Ekanayake), it further stated that,

.

. .

.

. 01

.

.

As set out in the written submission of the Petitioner, the Petitioner by

complaining that there was pain in his legs and requesting for pain medication

coupled with the doctors observations clearly establish that the petitioner was in

pain and discomfort at the time he was produced to the doctor by the police.

Moreover, Medico-Legal Reports of the JMOs office clearly state that the

Petitioner had a laceration measuring 1 cm 1cm on the lateral aspect of left foot

to the ankle joint and 6 cm 4 cm contusion on the dorsal aspect of the right foot.

According to the Affidavit of the Sergeant Kumarawansha marked as 1R4(a), he

stated that,

I state that at that moment Korawakage Ranjith alias Shantha was arrested for

the offence of possessing a hand grenade, I state that at the time of arrest

Korawakage Ranjith alias Shantha was smelling of alcohol.

16

However, the Medico Legal Report of JMOs office of the General Hospital,

Matara stated that the patient was not under the influence of liquor. This

observation further disproves the Respondents position as to the Petitioners

condition at the time of arrest.

It is a fundamental right that police officers should respect the right of all arrested

persons and detainees to be free from torture, or other cruel, inhuman, or

degrading treatment, as guaranteed by Article 11 of the Constitution. Such

prohibited acts include the use of threat and language that may impair the

detainees capacity to think and act voluntarily and make voluntary statements.

A police officer should resort to the use of force only to achieve a legitimate

objective associated with discharging their duties, and in a manner that is

prescribed by law. In the event that a police officer is required to use such force,

such force must strictly adhere to principles of necessity, reasonableness and

proportionality. Any order by a senior police officer authorising the use of force

should set out clear parameters for the use of force in compliance with the law.

Such senior police officers should take full responsibility for any unnecessary,

unreasonable or disproportionate use of force taken in terms of such orders. Where

the use of force is lawfully required, all deployed police officers must make every

effort within their capacity to avoid the loss of life and to minimise damage and

injury to any person, including a person being arrested or an arrested person or

detainee who is being transferred. Such efforts include providing medical aid to

any injured or affected persons as a consequence of the use of force by the police.

Considering Article 11, in W.D.K. de Silva v Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation

[1989] 2 Sri L.R. 393, at page 405 Per Amerasinghe, J.

In my view Article 11 of the Constitution prohibits any act by which

severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is without lawful sanction in

accordance with a procedure established by law, intentionally inflicted on a

17

person (whom I shall refer to as the 'victim') by a public official acting in the

discharge of his executive or administrative duties or under colour of office, for

such purposes as obtaining from the victim or a third person a confession or

information, such information being actually or supposedly required for official

purposes, imposing a penalty upon the victim for an offence or breach of a rule

he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or

intimidating or coercing the victim or a third person to do or refrain from doing

something which the official concerned believes the victim or the third person

ought to do or refrain from doing, as the case may be.

Article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or

Degrading Treatment or Punishment defines torture as any intentional act that

causes severe physical or mental pain or suffering. This includes acts committed

to obtain information or confessions, to punish someone for an act they or others

have committed or are suspected of committing, or to intimidate or coerce them

or others. It applies when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or with the consent

or acquiescence of a public official or someone acting in an official capacity.

In Landage Ishara Anjali (Minor) and another v. Waruni Bogahawatte and

Others [SC (FR) No.677/2012 SC Minutes of 12.06.2019]at page 16 Justice

Aluwihare, PC refers to Dr. Amerasinghe J, in Silva v. Chairman, Fertilizer

Corporation, analyzing the concept of inhuman treatment observed that;

The treatment contemplated by Article 11 wasnt confined to the realm of

physical violence. It would rather embrace the sphere of the soul or mind as well.

Section 12 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or

Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act, No.22 of 1994 defines "torture" as

any act causing severe physical or mental pain to another person. This includes

acts done to obtain information or confessions, to punish for an alleged offence,

or to intimidate based on discrimination.

18

Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets out that everyone

has the right to be protected from torture and from cruel, inhuman, or degrading

treatment or punishment.

When evaluating the evidence of the Petitioner in demonstrating the alleged

violation of Article 11. Cases involving allegations of torture, the standard of

proof required is that of a balance of probability, but it necessitates a higher degree

of certainty in favor of the petitioners case.

In the case of Channa Pieris and Others v. Attorney-General and Others

[1994] 1 Sri LR 1, at page 6 Amerasinghe J held that in considering whether

Article 11 has been violated, three general observations apply:

I. The acts or conduct complained of must be qualitatively of a kind that a

Court may take cognizance of. Where it is not so, the Court will not declare

that Article 11 has been violated.

II. Torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment may take

many forms, psychological and physical.

III. Having regard to the nature and gravity of the issue, a high degree of

certainty is required before the balance of probability might be said to tilt

in favour of a petitioner endeavouring to discharge his burden of proving

that he was subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment.

The necessity for such a high degree of proof is reaffirmed in Nandasena v.

Chandradasa Officer in Charge Police Station Hiniduma and Others [2006]

1 Sri LR 207, at page 213 where it was held that:

it would be necessary for the Petitioner to prove his position by way

of medical evidence and/or by way of affidavits and for such purpose it would be

essential for the Petitioner to bring forward such documents with a high degree

of certainty for the purpose of discharging his burden

19

As per the Learned Magistrates observations which is produced below,

....

.

The medical reports clearly state the nature of the injuries of each accused. The

Petitioners medical report corroborates the Petitioners version of how he

sustained injuries. Also the Affidavit of Chandikas wife which is marked as P2,

states that she saw her husband lying injured on the floor of the police cell.

Further, according to the letter submitted by the Assistant Superintendent Police

of Special Investigation Unit dated 31.07.2019, it stated that,

,

. 6

, 02

, . .

Considering all available evidence in this regard, I find the Fundamental Rights

of the Petitioner enshrined in Article 11 of the Constitution has been violated by

the Respondents. When considering the available evidence, the conduct and

actions of the Respondents clearly demonstrate the gravity of the offenses they

have committed.

I will now consider the alleged infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution guarantees,

'All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to equal protection of the

law.'

The fundamental aim of Article 12(1) is to protect individuals from arbitrary,

capricious, irrational, unreasonable, discriminatory, or vexatious actions by

executive or administrative bodies. Article 12(1) of the Constitution guarantees

20

both equality before the law and equal protection under the law. In its Full Bench

decision in Sampanthan et al. v. Attorney-General et al. [SC FR 351-356 &

358-361/19, SC Minutes of 13.12.2018], this Court affirmed that the right

guaranteed by Article 12(1) also includes the protection of the 'Rule of Law,'

referencing jurisprudence established in Jayanetti v. Land Reform Commission

[1984] 2 Sri LR 172 and Shanmugam Sivarajah v. OIC Terrorist

Investigation Division and others [SC FR 15/2010, SC Minutes of 27.07.2017].

In the case of Rajapaksha v. Rathnayake and Ten Others [2016] Sri L.R 1 119,

at page 130, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew stated that;

When the 1st Respondent arrested the petitioner without any reasons and

fabricated a false charge against him, can it be said that he got equal protection

of law and that the 1st Respondent applied the principle that 'all persons are equal

before the law' to the petitioner? This question has to be answered and is answered

in the negative. It is now proved that the petitioner was arrested and detained in

the police station without any reason and the charge framed against him was a

fabricated charge. Thus the principle that 'all persons are equal before the law

and are entitled to the equal protection of the law' has not been applied to the

petitioner by the 1st Respondent.

It is clear that the power of arrest must not be exercised arbitrarily, as doing so

would violate the Petitioners right to equal protection under the law. Section

32(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 as amended

describes that a peace officer could arrest a person who has been concerned in any

cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or

credible information has been received or a reasonable suspicion. In the present

case, according to the Affidavit of the 1st Respondent, it stated that the 3rd

Respondent has made a complaint to the personal mobile phone of the 1st

Respondent.

According to the letter submitted to the Legal Aid Commission by the ASP of

Special Investigation Unit dated 31.07.2019, it stated that,

According to the Affidavit of Manage Somadasa, a bystander to the incident (as

depicted in the affidavit as P3) confirms the position that it was not the Petitioner

who smashed the windscreen. He stated that on his Affidavit,

I state that to my surprise as Chandika and Shantha left Mahesh, I saw

Mahesh pick a large stone nearby his vehicle and smash the windscreen of his

vehicle with it.

22

The 1st Respondent averred that he was out on patrol on 11.09.2016 with the 2nd

Respondent and three others when the 3rd Respondent made the complaint at 5.30

p.m. according to the paragraph 7(c) of the Affidavit of the 1st Respondent.

Further, according to the documents marked 1R1 and 1R3, it stated that police

officers left the police station for an investigation. However, it is clear that when

the Petitioner was arrested by the Respondents, the team did not have even one set

of handcuffs between them. The 1st Respondent averred in his Affidavit that when

he was searching the Petitioner, he found a hand grenade hanging from his trouser

belt. After that the Petitioner was arrested by the 1st Respondent and the team for

the offence of possessing a hand grenade and that at the time of arrest the

Petitioner smelled alcohol. The Petitioner specifically stated that no reasons were

given to the Petitioner regarding the arrest or detention.

As per to the Section 23(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No 15 of 1979

as amended, In making an arrest the person making the same shall actually touch

or confine the body of the person to be arrested unless there be a submission to

the -custody by word or action and shall inform the person to be arrested of the

nature of the charge or allegation upon which he is arrested.

Police officers should respect the right of every person to be presumed innocent

until proven guilty as guaranteed by Article 13(5) of the Constitution. This

requirement is designed to provide the arrested person with the opportunity to

challenge the arrest promptly. While there is no need for a specific form or a

detailed description of the charges, it is essential that the arrested person is

informed in straightforward, non-technical language that they can understand,

outlining the fundamental legal and factual grounds for their arrest as soon as

reasonably possible. Where a person is arrested on suspicion that he or she has

committed an offence, such suspicion must be reasonable. In Dumbell v. Roberts

[1944] 1 All ER 326 Scott LJ observed:

23

The principle of personal freedom, that every man should be presumed

innocent until he is found guilty, applies also to the police function of arrest..For

that reason it is of importance that no one should be arrested by the police except

on grounds which in the particular circumstances of the arrest really justify the

entertainment of a reasonable suspicion.

In Muttusamy v. Kannangara [1951] 52 NLR 324, Gratien J emphasised that

the arresting officer must entertain such reasonable suspicion before he arrests the

person concerned. Thus, the arresting officer cannot arrest a person in the course

of a voyage of discovery. In Suriyarachchige Lakshman de Silva and others v.

OIC Police Station, Kiribathgoda [SC(FR) 09/2011 SC Minutes of

03.03.2017], at page 14 H.N.J.Perera, J refers to Priyasath Dep, PC, J, in

Dhammarathana Thero v. OIC Police Station, Mihintale, [SC(FR)313/2009

SC Minutes 9.11.2011] the Court observed that

...there should be a reasonable complaint, credible information or a

reasonable suspicion where arrests are made without a warrant.

In the General Guidelines and Recommendations to Sri Lanka Police on

Preventing Custodial and Encounter Deaths by the Report of Human Right

commission, 11.12.2023 emphasised that,

During preliminary investigations, all suspects should be afforded the right not

to self-incriminate. Police officers should respect the right of any suspect to

remain silent and not be forced under any circumstance to make any self-

incriminating statements.

An arrested person should be immediately afforded the opportunity to

communicate with their family or a friend of their choice regarding the arrest.

Such right is guaranteed by section 15(2) of the International Convention for the

Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Act, No. 5 of 2018. Such

24

arrested persons should be afforded the opportunity to communicate the reason

for their arrest, the place of arrest, the police station from which the arrest was

made, and the place of detention.

The actions of the Respondents in arresting and detaining the Petitioner without

proper justification or reasonable suspicion, and their failure to inform the

Petitioner of the charges at the time of arrest, constitute a clear violation of the

Petitioners rights under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Respondents'

conduct was not in accordance with the constitutional guarantees of equality

before the law and protection from arbitrary detention.

Considering the liability of the 3rd Respondent, it is evident that the torture and

degrading treatment inflicted upon the Petitioner were carried out at his instigation

and encouragement. The 3rd Respondent not only threatened the Petitioner with

incarceration for 14 days but also actively witnessed the 1st and 2nd Respondents

torturing the Petitioner and Chandika within the premises of the Urubokka Police

Station. Furthermore, the undisputed fact that the 3rd Respondent was present at

the Urubokka Police Station during the time in question further underscores his

involvement and tacit approval of these unlawful actions, making him liable for

the violations committed (as depicted in the P6). Therefore, it can be established

that the 3rd Respondent instigated Petitioners arrest, detention and torture using

his influential position. The acts of the 3rd Respondent, considered in isolation,

cannot be regarded as 'executive or administrative action'; the question is whether

the nexus between those acts and the acts or omissions of the 1st and 2nd

Respondents was sufficient to transform what would otherwise have been purely

private action into 'executive or administrative action. The infringement of the

Petitioners fundamental rights was the consequence of the actions of the 3rd

Respondent.

25

In Faiz v Attorney General and others [1995] 1 Sri LR, at page 376, Mark

Fernando J emphasised that,

Article 126 speaks of an infringement by executive or administrative action; it

does not impose a further requirement that such action must be by an executive

officer. It follows that the act of a private individual would render him liable, if in

the circumstances that act is executive or administrative. The act of a private

individual would be executive if such act is done with the authority of the

executive: such authority, transforms an otherwise purely private act into

executive or administrative action; authority may be express, or implied from

prior or concurrent acts manifesting approval, instigation, connivance,

acquiescence, participation, and the like (including inaction in circumstances

where there is a duty to act); and from subsequent acts which manifest ratification

or adoption. While I use concepts and terminology of the law relating to agency,

and vicarious liability in delict, in my view responsibility under Article 126 would

extend to all situations in which the nexus between the individual and the executive

makes it equitable to attribute such responsibility. The executive, and the executive

officers from whom such authority flows would all be responsible for the

infringement. Conversely, when an infringement by an executive officer, by

executive or administrative action, is directly and effectively the consequence of

the act of a private individual (whether by reason of instigation, connivance,

participation or otherwise) such individual is also responsible for the executive

or administrative action and the infringement caused thereby. In any event this

court would have power under Article 126(4) to make orders and directions

against such an individual in order to afford relief to the victim.

Considering the liability of the State, the Police force is an organ of the State and

the State should respect the duty and responsibility to protect the fundamental

26

rights of the citizens. In Amal Sudath Silva v Kodituwakku Inspector of Police

and Others [1987] 2 Sri LR, at page 119 stated that,

The police force, being an organ of the State, is enjoined by the Constitution to

secure and advance this right and not to deny, abridge or restrict the same in any

manner and under any circumstances.

The State is liable for all the violations of the Petitioner's fundamental rights, as

they resulted from actions taken by the 1st and 2nd Respondents. In Landage

Ishara Anjali (Minor) and another v. Waruni Bogahawatte and Others [SC

(FR) No.677/2012 SC Minutes of 12.06.2019], at page 21, Justice Aluwihare,

PC,J stated that,

This Court also takes an opportunity to note with concern the increasing number

of incidents of abuse of power by law enforcement authorities. There is no doubt

that what is brought before Courts is a fragment of the totality of incidents taking

place across the country

Furthermore, in Rannula Sugath Mohana Mendis v D.K.A.Sanath Kumara

and others [SC (FR) No 100/2022 decided on 06.10.2023], at page 14,

Thurairaja, PC, J emphasised that,

If this Court were to criticise the actions of the Police Force, it need not look

further than the police motto itself; which states

those who live by the Dhamma are protected by the Dhamma. One would expect

that the Police force of Sri Lanka would follow this motto when carrying out their

duties, without mala fide. However, we observe, they have failed to stick to the

basics of their code of conduct and the principles of natural justice.

The liability of the State arises from its duty to protect and uphold the fundamental

rights of its citizens, a responsibility that extends to all its organs, including the

Police Force. As an integral part of the State, the Police are expected to act within

27

the bounds of the law and with respect for individual rights. When the Police, or

any state agency, engage in actions that violate these rights, the State is held

accountable for the harm caused. This liability is not only a matter of legal

obligation but also a reflection of the State's commitment to justice, fairness, and

the rule of law. Therefore, when the actions of the Police lead to the infringement

of fundamental rights, the State bears responsibility for rectifying those wrongs

and ensuring that such violations do not recur. Accountability, transparency, and

adherence to ethical standards are crucial in maintaining public trust and

upholding the constitutional guarantee of protection for all citizens.

I have carefully considered all material before this Court and it is clear that the

1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents versions of facts and evidence are inconsistent.

Torturing and assaulting the Petitioner brutally by the Police cannot be accepted.

In Weheragedara Ranjith Sumangala v Bandara, Police Officer and others

[SC (FR) No.107/2011 SC Minutes of 14.12.2023], at page 59 stated that,

.....the amount of compensation awarded must sufficiently reflect the gravity of

the offences as well as the audacity of the offenders. Especially where violations

of Article 11 are to be found, it is necessary to award compensation in such

amounts adequate to deter such degenerates.

Having examined the facts of the case and material placed before this Court, I

allow the Application of the Petitioners and hold that their fundamental rights as

guaranteed by Article 11 and Article 12(1) have been infringed upon by the acts

of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the State.

Hence, the Respondents are ordered to pay compensation to the Petitioner in the

following manner:

1. The 1st Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs.

1000,000/- (Rupees One Million);

28

2. The 2nd Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs.

1000,000/- (Rupees One Million);

3. The 3rd Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs.

1000,000/- (Rupees One Million).

4. The State is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs.500,000/- (Rupees

Five-Hundred Thousand).

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents are to pay the aforementioned sums, within six

months from the date of judgement, out of their personal funds. Furthermore I

direct the State to pay as compensation to the Petitioner within six months from

the date of this judgment.

Application Allowed.
