The first Scheme of Recruitment for the Authority was approved by the Department of Management Services only on 13th May 2002 [P6]. It is only thereafter that the 3rd \u2013 6th Petitioners had joined the Authority as District Officers during 2004. The 7th Petitioner had joined the Authority as a Project Officer on 1st March 2005. These appointments of the 3rd \u2013 7th Petitioners had been made on a permanent basis. 7. Public Administration Circular No. 30/2006 was issued to regularise and standardise the salaries of employees serving in Government Corporations, Authorities and Enterprises. Upon the recommendation of the Salaries and Cadre Commission, the salaries of all employees of the Authority including the Petitioners were re-classified and the Petitioners had been placed on the salary scale of Middle Management Service bearing Salary Code MM1-3-2006 [Grade C3]. The Petitioners state that their salaries were once again converted in March 2007 and re-classified as MM-1-1-2006 [Grade C1]. 8. Pursuant to discussions between the Authority and the Department of Management Services, all staff positions of the Authority were restructured in October 2012 and by letter dated 16th October 2012 [P9], the Department of Management Services had forwarded the new cadre structure of the Authority with posts being re-designated and/or re-classified. P9 also proposed that those serving in the Authority as at that date be absorbed into the new positions that were being created and/or re-classified. 9. As at the time P9 was issued, the 1st \u2013 6th Petitioners were holding the posts of District Officer or Field Officer, while the 7th Petitioner was holding the position of Project Officer. According to P9, the posts of District Officer and Field Officer were to be re-classified as Assistant Director/Deputy Director (Provincial). The post of Project Officer held by the 7th Petitioner however was not re-classified since the said post was to be made redundant. While all those holding the post of Project Officer were to be absorbed to the Authority, the said post was to be limited to the holder, with of course the right to be promoted in accordance with the applicable Scheme of Recruitment.",
