"the  case  was  not  mentioned  previously,  or  to  inquire  into  the  status  of  the"
"other case until it was stated when Case No. 07/2020 was mentioned in open"
"Court on  06-12-2022, that Case No. 06/2020 has not been listed yet.  This"
"clearly  goes  on  to  show  the  interest  the  petitioner  has  exhibited  as  to  the"
"applications filed before the Court."
"It is clear that even after the case was mentioned nearly 3 years after filing of"
"the same, the Registered Attorney or the petitioner has still failed to realize or"
"inquire whether the notices that should have been issued at the time of filing"
"of the action has gone out or been served. This was despite the direction given"
"by Court on 06-12-2022, directing the Counsel who represented the petitioner"
"to take all necessary steps in relation to both the matters within 2 weeks from"
"the day."
"It appeared that instead, the only step taken had been to file a motion on 15-"
"12-2022 together with a copy of the written submissions marked “X3(b)”, and"
"that has been the only notice served on the respondent without serving the"
"initial petition or the documents filed."
"I am in full agreement with the submissions of the learned President’s Counsel"
"for the petitioner that the Court should not rely on mere technical objections"
"to  decide  on  a  matter  that  needs  adjudication  from  the  Court,  if  such"
"technicality had not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties. I am in"
"full agreement with the observations made by this Court in previous decisions"
"cited by the learned President’s Counsel in this regard."
"However, it is my considered view that disregarding a preliminary objection of"
"this nature should not allow a party who has shown no regard to the Rules of"
"Procedure and is clearly guilty of lashes and negligence, to benefit from such"
"action of its own making.  I am also  of the view that each  default  has to be"
"considered on a case-by-case basis in the context of the purpose of the Rule"
"that has been violated."
