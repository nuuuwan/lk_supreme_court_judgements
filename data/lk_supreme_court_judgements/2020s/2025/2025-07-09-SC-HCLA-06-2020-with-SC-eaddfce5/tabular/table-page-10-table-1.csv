"case record, the respondent came to know that the matter is listed for support"
"on 16-02-2023."
"This has resulted in the respondent submitting the motion dated 18-01-2023"
"in both the cases, raising the preliminary objections as to the maintainability"
"of the applications, moving that both Leave to Appeal Applications should be"
"dismissed in limine as the petitioner has failed to follow the mandatory rules"
"of procedure laid out in Supreme Court Rules."
"At the hearing, the learned President’s Counsel substantiated his argument"
"citing several decided cases of this Court, and argued that the failure by the"
"petitioner to prosecute its case with due diligence is a matter that should be"
"considered  by  this  Court  in  dismissing  the  Leave  to  Appeal  Applications  in"
"limine."
"It was the submissions of the  learned President’s Counsel who represented"
"the petitioner in both the cases that the petitioner at all times acted in full"
"compliance of the Supreme Court Rules of 1990 and caused and tendered the"
"relevant documents to the Registrar of this Court, when the Leave to Appeal"
"Application was filed on 09-01-2020."
"It was further claimed that the Supreme Court Registry also confirmed this"
"fact to the Registered Attorney of the petitioner."
"However,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  also  agreed  that  there  was  no"
"minute  which  indicates  that  the  notices  and  the  other  relevant  documents"
"have been tendered to Court in both the case records."
"He went on to submit that this should be considered as, if at all, a thing that"
"occurred due to the restrictions imposed upon the judicial system due to the"
"Coronavirus disease that was prevalent in the country during the period, and"
"that should be taken into consideration in determining these objections. He"
"was  of  the  view  that,  as  the  respondent  has  been  served  with  the  relevant"
"material  since  then,  no  prejudice  would  be  caused  to  the  respondent,  and"
"hence, the preliminary objections should stand overruled. It was his view that"
"the Leave to Appeal Application in both the cases should be considered on its"
"merits by the Court, rather than on technicalities."
