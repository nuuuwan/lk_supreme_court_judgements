"arbitral award dated 23-10-2017 marked and produced as P-07 along with"
"the petition filed before the High Court."
"In case No. 294/2018, the respondent has instituted proceedings to enforce"
"the same arbitral award made by the arbitrators on 23-10-2017 marked and"
"produced as P-13 along with the respondent’s petition."
"From the impugned judgment, the learned High Court Judge had determined"
"that he has no reasons to refuse the enforcement order in Case No. 294/2018,"
"and had proceeded to order the enforcement of the said award according to"
"the award dated 23-10-2017, subject to the limitation of the legal fees that"
"can be claimed to a sum of Rs. 500,000/- and restricting the compensation"
"awarded to a sum of USD 10,000/-."
"Being aggrieved of the said judgment, the petitioner has instituted both these"
"Applications for Leave to Appeal before this Court on 09-02-2020."
"When both the matters were taken up on 27-09-2023 for the consideration of"
"granting leave, the learned Counsel for the respondent in both the cases drew"
"the attention of the Court to the motion dated 18-01-2023 filed on behalf of"
"the respondent, where the respondent has raised preliminary objections as to"
"the  maintainability  of  these  applications  and  has  sought  permission  of  the"
"Court to support the said preliminary objections."
"Accordingly, the matter was fixed for inquiry in relation to the said preliminary"
"objections  and  both  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  were  heard  on  07-05-"
"2025, and this Court also granted an opportunity to the parties to file written"
"submissions, if any, together with legal authorities."
"Although  it  has  been  contended  in  the  motion  dated  18-01-2023  filed  on"
"behalf of the respondent that the petitioner has failed and/or neglected to act"
"in compliance with Rules 8 and 34 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1990, at"
"the  hearing,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  agreed  that  considering  the"
"objections in terms of section 34 of the Rules would not arise, and would only"
"limit his objections as to the compliance of Rule 8."
