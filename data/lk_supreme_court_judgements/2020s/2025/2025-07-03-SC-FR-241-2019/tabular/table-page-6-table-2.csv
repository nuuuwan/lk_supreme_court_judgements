"The stand taken by the Attorney General"
"Written submissions have been submitted on behalf of the Attorney General in addition"
"to the oral submissions presented by the learned Deputy Solicitor General (‘DSG’) during"
"the hearing of the instant Application. The Attorney General, based on the circumstances"
"of this case, has taken the view that the Petitioner’s application is misconceived in law and"
"there is no basis on which the Petitioner can seek redress in terms of a violation of Article"
"11 against the 1st and 2nd Respondents."
"It is stated that the Petitioner had failed to submit the detailed medical report pursuant to"
"the Medico-Legal Examination Form marked ‘P8’. A query has been raised regarding how"
"the Petitioner, still an Officer Cadet as of 23.02.2019, came into contact with the Chief"
"Judicial Medical Officer of the National Hospital of Colombo to contrive the said ‘P8’."
"Further,  it  is  claimed  that  neither  the  Petition  nor  the  Counter  Affidavit  contains  any"
"evidence disputing the medical findings related to the Petitioner’s ‘recurrent left shoulder"
"dislocation,’ which led to his discharge.  The 1st Respondent, as per the document marked"
"‘1R3’, has assumed duties at the KDU only on 02.02.2018 and this was after the Petitioner"
"suffered the injuries of the dislocation of the shoulder, on 28.07.2017."
"The  learned  DSG  submits  that  the  Petitioner  is  bound  to  follow  the  required  chain  of"
"command and the relevant code of conduct as described in the document marked ‘P2’."
"However,  the  Petitioner  was  found  to  have  violated  the  chain  of  command  and  has"
"disobeyed  the  code  of  conduct  on  several  occasions.  Moreover,  it  is  argued  that  the"
"Petitioner  intentionally  orchestrated  the  incident  to  initiate  this  legal  action,  aiming  to"
"secure a position as a day scholar, fully aware that he faced discharge from the Army on"
