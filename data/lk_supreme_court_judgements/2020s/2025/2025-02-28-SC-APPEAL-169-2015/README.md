DECIDED ON: 28th February 2025

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The instant case relates to an action instituted on or about 22nd August 2005 by the

Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as Plaintiff or Respondent)

before the District Court of Colombo against her brother, the 1st Defendant-

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as 1st Defendant or

Appellant), seeking a inter alia a declaration that the 1st Defendant is holding the

property described in the scheduled to the Plaint on constructing trust in favour of

the Plaintiff and for a direction to the Appellant to reconvey the said property to the

Plaintiff.

BACKGROUND OF THE CASE

2. The Plaintiff had transferred the property in question to the 1st Defendant by Deed of

Transfer No. 1527 dated 02nd May 1990 attested by Nalini Peiris, Notary Public, and

contended that the said transfer done upon the 1st Defendants request to temporarily

transfer the said property to his name, in order to enable his application for a loan

from the Employees Provident Fund of the Ceylon Electricity Board. The Plaintiff

further contended that the 1st Defendant obtained a loan from the Employees

Provident Fund providing the property in question as security thereof. The Plaintiffs

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 51

position is that she did not receive any consideration for the transfer of this property

and argued, therefore, that the transfer formed a contrastive trust.

3. When the Plaintiff wanted the property re-transferred, the 1st Defendant had delayed

the same urging that he is unable to do so until the loan obtained from the 2nd

Defendant is repaid in full.

4. Following full payment of the loan, the Plaintiff alleges that the 1st Defendant still

refused to retransfer the property in accordance with their initial understanding,

demanding Rs. 500,000/- from the Plaintiff for such retransfer.

5. The 1st Defendant took up the position that he mortgaged the said property to the

2nd Defendant in order to the purchase the said property for the purpose of building

a house, and he contended that all monies from the said loan were paid to the Plaintiff

as consideration for the transfer.

6. He vehemently denies ever agreeing to retransfer the property or demanding Rs.

500,000/- in breach of such an agreement to reconvey. According to the 1st Defendant,

he had found that the said property cannot be developed after purchasing the same

and had intended to sell it. He states that in or around 2005 the Plaintiffs son, his

nephew, indicated an interest to purchase the property in suit back from the 1st

Defendant for Rs. 500,000/-. According to him, for this reason he had given the Deed

of Transfer to the Plaintiff.

7. The District Court of Colombo by its judgment dated 24th April 2009 dismissed the

case of the Plaintiff holding in favour of the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiff thereafter

preferred an appeal against the said judgment to the Civil Appellate High Court of the

Western Province holden in Colombo. The Civil Appellate High Court delivered its

judgment on 17th January 2014 ordering a retrial.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 51

8. Aggrieved by the said decision the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Appellant Petitioned to

the Supreme Court praying, inter alia, for this Court to set aside the aforementioned

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court and affirm the judgment of the District

Court of Colombo.

QUESTIONS OF LAW

9. On 01st October 2015 this Court granted leave on the following questions of law

submitted by the Appellant:

i. Have Their Lordships misdirected themselves in holding that the Learned

District Judge who finally delivered the judgement but he has not got an

opportunity even to hear the evidence of the single witness who has testified at

the trial?

ii. Have their Lordships thus erred in holding that the case must be re-tried in the

District Court of Colombo?

iii. Have Their Lordships misdirected themselves in holding As such we find that the

defendant-respondent has not proved by evidence that the said payment has been

duly paid to the appellant [Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent of the instant case]?

iv. Have Their Lordships thus erred in holding that the plaintiffs transaction with

her brother in respect of Deed No. 1527 has been duly completed has not proved.?

ANALYSIS

First and Second Questions of Law

10. I see it convenient to dispense with the first and second questions of law at the very

outset as they relate to matters observable on the face of the record.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 51

11. The position of the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Appellant was that the learned Judges

of the Civil Appellate High Court had misdirected themselves in concluding that the

learned District Judge who delivered the judgment did not have the benefit of hearing

the evidence of a single witness at the trial. This finding of the Civil Appellate High

Court is based on an erroneous submission to this effect made by the Plaintiff-

Appellant-Respondent in their written submissions before the Civil Appellate High

Court.1

12. As the 1st Defendant contends, it is an error apparent on the face of the record. The

learned District Court Judge who gave the judgment has, in fact, the 1st Defendants

evidence in its entirety. Moreover, all parties have agreed to adopt the testimonies

given before the learned Judges predecessor on 26th January 2009.2

13. Moreover, it is not uncommon for original court judges to give judgments based on

evidence led before their predecessors, especially in long draw disputes relating to

land such as this. As such, even where a district judge has not had an opportunity to

hear any witnesses and bases a judgment on the evidence heard before their

predecessors, that, on its own, cannot be considered a reason to set aside such

judgment, except under special circumstances.

14. Accordingly, the first question of law is answered in the affirmative.

15. The second question of law is whether their Lordships thus erred in holding that the

case must be re-tried in the District Court of Colombo?3 This question presupposes

2 Proceedings of the District Court of Colombo Case No. 7371/SPL dated 26th January 2009, p. 1

3 Emphasis added

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 51

that Their Lordships have solely based their decision to order a retrial on the finding

that the judge who gave the judgment has not had the opportunity to hear any of the

witnesses.

16. The judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court indicates that the Court has taken into

account the submission of the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent that the demeanor of

witnesses in the instant case is extremely important to be considered as case

depended largely on the factual evidence given by the parties in open court. The Court

has also taken into consideration the contention of the Plaintiff-Appellant-

Respondent that none of the witness testified before the District Judge who gave the

judgment, which is factually inaccurate as already observed.

17. As apparent from the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, this appear to be

the basis of ordering a retrial as no other reasons are set out therein. As such, the

learned Judges have ordered a retrial based on a manifestly erroneous finding.

18. Therefore, the second question of law, too, is answered in the affirmative.

Third Question of Law

19. The last two questions of law relate to the very foundation upon which the Plaintiffs

claim before the District Court was based. That is, the purported agreement between

the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant, at the time of the transfer, to reconvey the property

in question once the purpose of the transfer (obtaining a loan from the Employees

Provident Fund of the Ceylon Electricity Board) is fulfilled. This understanding at the

time of transferring the property, if properly established, leads to an inferencealbeit

an inconclusive onethat the transferor intended not to dispose of the beneficial

interest of the property transferred. This would, most certainly lend support to the

claim that there is a constructive trust for the benefit of the transferor, the Plaintiff.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 51

20. In this regard the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant invited this Courts

attention to the fact that Deed No. 1527 dated 02nd May 1990 attested by Nalini Peiris,

Notary Public (marked 1), by which the transfer in question was made, contains

no conditions whatsoever indicating the formation of a trust. In addition, the Appellant

further pointed out that the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent has expressly admitted

the receipt of Rupees 40,000/- in consideration for the transfer as observable on page

1 of the said Deed. With regard to consideration the attestation of the Notary states

that withinmentioned consideration will be paid to the Vendor by the Ceylon

Electricity Board Provident Fund Society, indicating that no consideration was paid

before the Notary.

21. It was the Appellants contention that, what the Plaintiff has admitted to have received

as consideration on page 1 is that which was to be paid by the Ceylon Electricity Board

Provident Fund Society as referred to in the attestation. In light of this, the Appellant

contended that there is an outright transfer of the property for consideration of

Rupees 40,000/-, the receipt of which the Plaintiff has admitted in the Deed.

22. In this setting, the Appellant sought to argue by virtue of Section 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance, while acknowledging the provisos thereto, that the Plaintiff was estopped

from contending anything contrary to the contents of the Deed marked 1.

23. What is alleged here by the Plaintiff is an oral promise to reconvey the property once

the 1st Defendants purpose is fulfilled. Such a promise, however well established, most

certainly cannot contradict, vary, add to or subtract from a notarial document such as

1for that requires compliance with Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance. In this sense, this promise on its own is of little to no utility, as it would

not amount to an enforceable pactum de retrovendendo.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 51

24. In spite of this general infirmity associated with informal promises to reconvey, a party

may lead evidence of such a promise for the purpose of establishing a trust governed

either by Section 5(3) or Chapter IX of the Trust Ordinance.4 If not, as has been

previously observed by this Court, said provisions of the Trust Ordinance effectively

becomes nugatory.5

25. As Dr. Abdul Majeed notes, in Equity and the Law of Trusts, it is always available

to a party to a suit to lead parol evidence to establish the true nature of the transaction

as an exception to the rules contained in sections 92/93 of the Evidence Ordinance, if

the land is transferred as security for a loan or the transfer in fact creates a trust as per

section 83 of the Trust Ordinance, such an exception would be an instance permitted by

law to lead parol evidence to establish the true nature of the transaction.6

26. Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance provides that,

Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot reasonably

be inferred consistently with the attendant circumstances that he intended to

dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must hold such

property for the benefit of the owner or his legal representative.

27. Basnayake CJ commented describing the words attendant circumstances in

Muttammah v. Thiyagaraja as follows:

Attendant circumstances are to my mind circumstances which precede or follow

the transfer but are not too far removed in point of time to be regarded as

4 See the analysis of A.H.M.D. Nawaz J in Vairamuttu Palagapodi v. Gnanamuttu Kanmani C.A. Case No. 201/1998(F), CA Minutes of 30th May 2016, pp. 12-15

6 Dr. U.L. Abdul Majeed, Equity and the Law of Trusts (Revised 2nd edn 2022) p. 231

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 51

attendant which expression in this context may be understood as accompanying

or connected with. Whether a circumstance is attendant or not would depend on

the facts of each case.7

28. The jurisprudence of this Court has recognized various circumstances that can be

considered as attendant circumstances for the purpose of establishing a constructive

trust by virtue of Chapter IX of the Trust Ordinance. Such circumstances include:

I. Whether the transferor continued in possession after the conveyance;

II. If the transferor paid the whole cost of the conveyance;

III. If the consideration expressed on the deed is utterly inadequate to what would

be a fair purchase price for the property conveyed [Ehiya Lebbe v. Majeed (48

NLR 357, 359)];

IV. The relationship between parties [Valliyammai Achi v. Abdul Majeed (45 NLR

169, 191)].8

29. An oral promise to reconvey, too, as H.N.G. Fernando J noted in Muttammah v.

Thiyagarajah,9 is undoubtedly an attendant circumstance in cases of this nature,

since such a promise supports the proposition that there was no intention on the part

of the transferor to part with beneficial interest in the property.

9 62 NLR 559

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 51

30. His Lordship held therein,

The plaintiff sought to prove the oral promise to reconvey not in order to enforce

that promise but only to establish an attendant circumstances from which it could

be inferred that the beneficial interest did not pass. Although that promise was of

no force or avail in law by reason of Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance, it is nevertheless a fact from which an inference of the nature

contemplated in Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance properly arises. The

Prevention of Frauds Ordinance does not prohibit the proof of such an act. If the

arguments of counsel for the appellant based on the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance and on Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance are to be accepted, then

it will be found that not only Section 83, but also many of the other provisions in

chapter IX of the Trusts Ordinance will be nugatory. If for example attendant

circumstances in Section 83 means only matters contained in an instrument of

transfer of property, it is difficult to see how a conveyance of property can be held

in Trust unless indeed its terms are such as to create an express Trust.10

31. As can be clearly seen, while the Deed of Transfer itself is an important matter which

should be considered as one of the attendant circumstances, it is open to a plaintiff

to lead parol evidence with regard to other attendant circumstances from which it

could be inferred whether a transferor intended to dispose of beneficial interest or

not.

Is there sufficient proof of an oral promise to reconvey?

32. As I have already noted, there is no documentary proof of an agreement to reconvey.

However, the evidence of the Plaintiff as well as the two witnesses called by the

10 ibid, p. 571

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 51

Plaintiff have given evidence to the effect that the land was transferred to the 1st

Defendant to facilitate a loan and that the 1st Defendant agreed to reconvey the land

to the Plaintiff once that purpose is fulfilled. They have also given evidence as to the

extremely close relationship which existed between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant

at the time of this transfer.

33. Hettiarachchige Vasantha Sanjeewa, the son of the Plaintiff, is the first witness called

by the Plaintiff. He is also a witness to Deed of Transfer No. 1527, and has given

evidence with regard to the circumstances under which the said transfer was done. He

categorically states that his mother had no intention to sell the land. He further states

that it was transferred by his mother to the 1st Defendant in order to obtain a loan and

that his uncle, the 1st Defendant, agreed to reconvey the land prior to the Deed of

Transfer being executed. Even after strenuous cross-examination this position remain

consistent. Moreover, he states that there was an arrangement to recovery at a

subsequent time and that it was obstructed due the 1st Defendant requesting Rs.

500,000/- for the same.

34. Thereafter, Hettiarachchige Chandrani Nishanthi, one of the daughters of the Plaintiff,

has corroborated this position in her testimony. She states that she heard the

discussions between her mother and uncle which related to the transfer in question

and that her mother agreed to transfer the property to facilitate the 1st Defendants

attempt to obtain a loan. She has further given evidence with regard to the subsequent

arrangement to recovery being frustrated by the 1st Defendant requesting Rs.

500,000/- in corroboration of the testimony given by the earlier witness. The evidence

given by the Plaintiff, too, is consistent to this effect.

35. However, the 1st Defendant vehemently denies this, claiming that he intended to buy

a land for the purpose of building a house and ended up purchasing the property in

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 51

suit, as suggested by his bother-in-law, the husband of the Plaintiff. He further states

that he subsequently found the land to be one that cannot be developed and

expressed his intention to sell the same, at which point the Plaintiffs son approached

him to buy the land for Rs. 500,000/-. He states that a deed of transfer was prepared

for this purpose by his nephew and that he even fixed a date to sign the said deed.

However, he states that he refused to sign this deed when he realized that his nephew

had not brought the money as they previously agreed.

36. The evidence of the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent with regard to the agreement to

reconvey is probable, consistent and has been corroborated by two witnesses. There

is no more than a bare denial by the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

in this regard. As such, I am of the view that the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent has

proved the existence of an agreement to reconvey on a balance of probability.

37. However, evidence of such an agreement per se is not sufficient to establish a

constructive trust.11 There must be other attendant circumstances which indicates the

establishment of a constructive trust.

Is there sufficient evidence indicating that the payment has been paid to the Plaintiff?

38. Throughout the trial, parties have placed much emphasis on the question as to

whether or not any consideration has moved from the 1st Defendant to the Plaintiff.

Indeed, the third question of law before this Court relates entirely to this.

39. The Plaint of the Plaintiff before the District Court of Colombo in paragraph 5 avers

that 1

[the cheque issued to the Plaintiff by the Electricity

11 Vairamuttu Palagapodi v. Gnanamuttu Kanmani C.A. Case No. 201/1998(F), CA Minutes of 30th May 2016, pp. 15-17

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 51

Board was encashed by the 1st Defendant]. In her testimony, she states that she never

received any money and that she did not even see a cheque. As the learned President's

Counsel for the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant contended, this is a

somewhat contradictory position.

40. The Plaintiff further states in her evidence that she had never had a current account,

that she had never dealt with cheques and that she does not go to the bank except

with one her children.

41. The first and second witnesses, son and daughter of the Plaintiff, who gave evidence

clearly states that the Plaintiff is not someone who is capable of interacting with banks

on her own as she is illiterate and can do little more than signing her name. Both

witnesses also state that their mother did not receive cheque and that she could not

have encashed one without their assistance.

42. Denying the position of the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant states that he himself took the

Plaintiff to the Electricity Board in order to collect the cheque and that he got to know

the Electricity Board that she had collected the cheque which was in her name.

43. The 2nd Defendant, Palitha Kithsiri Samarawickrama, secretary/accountant of Ceylon

Electricity Board EPF, giving evidence confirms, having referred to the records, that a

cheque had been issued in the Plaintiff name and that it has been encashed. He further

confirms that a voucher is available on his record bearing the signature of the Plaintiff

acknowledging the receipt of the cheque from his office.

44. However, the 2nd Defendant is unable to give any evidence as to who has encashed it.

Furthermore, it is also clear that he has no personal knowledge of this particular

transaction in suit as he was not employed at secretary/accountant at the time. It is

clear that the evidence of the 2nd Defendant is only relevant insofar as to establish that

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 51

the cheque has been issued in the Plaintiffs name and the Plaintiff has signed and

collected it from the 2nd Defendants office. From this alone, we cannot come to a

conclusion that the Plaintiff would have encashed the cheque, given the nature of the

agreement the Plaintiff claims to have had with the 1st Defendantwhich was for the

property to be transferred to his name so that he may obtain a loan for its purchase

and raise money through his sister.

45. However, no party has adduced any evidence as to who in fact encashed the cheque,

and the cheque has not been listed as evidence. As the learned Presidents Counsel

for the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Appellant rightfully submitted, the Plaintiff in

paragraph 5 of her Plaint before the District Court has asserted that the 1st Defendant

encashed the cheque; and by virtue of Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance, he who

asserts must prove. As such, the burden of proving that 1st Defendant encashed the

cheque is clearly in the Plaintiff.

46. Learned Judges of the Civil Appellate High Court, however, have come to a conclusion

that the Defendant has had failed to prove by evidence that the payment has been

duly paid to the Plaintiff. In coming to this conclusion, the learned Judges have placed

the burden of proof on the Defendant, which is clearly bad in law.

47. For the foregoing reasons, the third question of law is answered in the affirmative.

Final Question of Law

48. Although the first three questions of law are answered in the affirmative, before I

answer the final question of law, I wish to consider other attendant circumstances of

the transfer for the sake of completion.

49. Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent also contended that, although a survey was done and

a plan was prepared, boundaries of the land were not marked and that possession of

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 51

the land in suit has never been passed to the 1st Defendant. This is corroborated by

the evidence of the first and second witnesses. The two witnesses as well as the

Plaintiff also state that the 1st Defendant has not taken any steps to develop the land

which he claims to have bought for the purpose of building a house.

50. The 1st Defendant, in his testimony before the District Court, states that he bought the

land intending to build a house and every intention of developing the property. He

has produced a document marked 4 to establish that he sought approval from

the Kotikawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha to develop the land. He states, he was

informed that 25 ft from the boundary of the Kolonnawa Canal ( ),

which is adjacent to the land in suit, must be set aside for the purpose of conservation.

He states that once 25 ft are set aside there was no room to build a house and

therefore, he had given up on developing the land and built a house on a different

land. He further claims to have erected a fence there and planted several trees, which

the other witnesses deny.

51. The document marked 4 gives an indication of an intention on the part of the 1st

Defendant to develop the land in suit. In addition, as the 1st Defendant himself has

admitted in his testimony, the Deed of Transfer marked 1 was in possession of

the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent at the time of filing action before the District

Court. However, the 1st Defendant states that he handed over the Deed of Transfer

marked 1 to his nephew in order to prepare a new deed of transfer after his

nephew showed interest to buy the land for Rs. 500,000/-.

52. The final question of law before this Court is as follows:

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 51

Have Their Lordships thus erred in holding that the plaintiffs transaction with

her brother in respect of Deed No. 1527 has been duly completed has not

proved.?12

53. This question of law is clearly related to the third question of law. As previously

discussed, since the Plaintiff has asserted in her Plaint that the 1st Defendant

enchashed the cheque, the burden of proving the same is on the Plaintiff. However,

no evidence has been adduced to this effect.

54. The 1st Defendant-Respondent-Respondent in his Written Submissions asserted that

the Plaintiff has made no attempt to call a witness from the Peoples Bank to prove

her assertion, despite having all opportunity to do so.13 The Counsel also invited the

Court to consider the presumption set out in Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance

in this regard.

55. Considering the aforementioned, I am of the opinion that learned Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court have erred in holding that the transaction between the Plaintiff

and her brother had not been duly proven.

56. Accordingly, I answer the final question of law in the affirmative.

Conclusion

57. All questions of law are answered in the affirmative. The judgment of the Civil

Appellate High Court is accordingly set aside.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J (For the Majority)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 51

58. Moreover, despite the finding that the Plaintiff has furnished evidence to tilt the

balance of probability towards the existence of an oral promise to reconvey, I am of

the view that the totality of the attendant circumstances does not lead to a sufficiently

strong inference that the Plaintiff did not intend to dispose of the beneficial interest

over the property in suit so as to displace a duly executed notarial instrument.

59. As such, I affirm the findings of the learned District Court of Colombo in judgment

dated 24th April 2009, subject to the variation.

60. I make no orders as to costs.

A.H.M.D. NAWAZ, J.

1. Oftentimes an appeal before this Court raises the quotidian issue of what English law

terms a gratuitous transfer resulting trust. This typically arises whenever there is a

sale of property absolute on the face of it but it is argued in the context of the transfer

and attendant circumstances that the vendor never intended to convey the beneficial

interest in the property to the purchaser. In such cases, recourse is made to Section 83

of the Trusts Ordinance and I would have thought that the interpretations placed on

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance and allied legal provisions have been so well settled,

and for such a long time, that any contrary construction becomes almost unimaginable.

However, the simplistic dismissal of such long-established principles in the judgment

of my brother, Justice Thurairaja, compels me to write this dissent. I will therefore

proceed to set out my own reasons as to why a constructive trust or resulting trust

arises based on the facts inherent in this case.

2. Let me unscramble the bare minimum of the facts. The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent

(the Plaintiff) seeks to recover her property, which she had transferred to her brother

the 1st Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (the 1st Defendant). Her claim is based on a

constructive trust under Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance, wherein the declaration

sought in the plaint states that, although the title to the land was transferred by the

Plaintiff sister through a notarial deed of transfer, the deed was executed in the name

of the 1st Defendant brother solely as security for a loan to be granted by the Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB). The Plaintiff asserts that her brother never provided

consideration for the transfer in his name and, therefore, the transferee (the 1st

Defendant brother) holds the legal title subject to a constructive trust in favor of the

Plaintiff sister.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 51

3. The case of the 1st Defendant brother is that soon after the transfer of the land to him

by the sister, he mortgaged the property to the 2nd Defendant (the CEB) for the

purpose of obtaining a loan but the proceeds of the loan were all paid to the Plaintiff

sister as consideration for the transfer. The assertion is that the consideration was paid

to the sister by a cheque issued in her favor by the CEB.

4. So, the quintessential question is whether consideration was paid for the transfer.

Whilst the sisters case was one of non-payment of consideration along with other

attendant circumstances, the brother asserted payment. The learned District Judge of

Colombo by his judgment dated 24 April 2009 dismissed the case of the Plaintiff sister

holding inter alia that the Plaintiff had failed to establish her contention of non-

payment, whilst the appeal preferred by the Plaintiff sister was allowed by the Civil

Appellate High Court of the Western Province.

5. The Civil Appellate High Court Judges ruled in favor of a constructive trust, holding

that the 1st Defendant had failed to provide evidence that the payment in question

had been duly made to the Plaintiff. Consequently, the 1st Defendant has appealed

this judgment to this Court. However, the Civil Appellate Judges also issued an

inconsistent order remanding the case for a re-trialan exercise in futility, as I will

demonstrate.

6. When conflicting claims regarding payment or non-payment of consideration arise

between the parties, the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, 1895, determine the

allocation of the burden of proof. In this context, Sections 101, 102 and 103, along

with other relevant provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, become applicable.

Accordingly, the key issue that arises is how the burden of proof should be distributed

between the sister and brother in this particular case.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 51

7. Indisputably, Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance is engaged and it is convenient to

posit the provision with the relevant illustration at this stage.

Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot reasonably

be inferred consistently with the attendant circumstances that he intended to

dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must hold

property for the benefit of the owner or his legal representative.

Illustration

(a) A conveys land to B without consideration

and declares no trust of any part.

It cannot, consistently with the circumstances

under which the transfer is made, reasonably

be inferred that A intended to transfer the

beneficial interest in the land. B holds the land

for the benefit of A.

8. Section 83 is found in Chapter IX of the Trusts Ordinance and the first provision in this

chapter (Section 82) states,

"An obligation in the nature of trust (hereinafter referred to as a 'constructive

trust') is created in the following cases.

9. Sections 82 and 97 make clear that Sections 83 to 96 each raise a trust, though the

sections themselves do not specifically mention the word trust, but refer to

.hold...for the benefit.....". However, it has never been doubted that these sections

give rise to trusts - Fernando v Coomaraswamy.1 A comparison between the Indian

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 23 of 51

Trusts Act, 1882 and Sri Lankan Trusts Ordinance No. 9 of 1917 reveals that Section

82 of our legislation is pari materia with Section 81 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882.

However, while our Chapter IX is expressly titled 'Constructive Trusts, the

corresponding chapter in the Indian legislation does not bear the same caption. En

passant, I must remark that Section 81 of the Indian Trusts Act is no longer in force in

India, having been repealed by Section 7 of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act,

1988.2

10. The omission of any reference to "constructive trusts" in the Indian Trusts Act is

intentional and understandable. Both the Indian legislation and the Sri Lanka Trusts

Ordinance recognize the concepts of resulting and constructive trusts as understood

in English law. However, the Trusts Ordinance, somewhat infelicitously, refers only to

"Constructive Trusts" in Chapter IX, whereas the Indian Trusts Act omits explicit

mention of either resulting or constructive trusts in its corresponding Chapter IX. Due

to this discrepancy, the distinguished jurist L.J.M. Cooray, in his treatise, suggested

that the phrase obligations in the nature of trusts might have been a more

appropriate heading for Chapter IX than constructive trusts.3

11. The reason is discernible. Both Sections 83 and 84 of the Trusts Ordinance embody

the English law concept of resulting trusts rather than constructive trusts. It cannot be

gainsaid that the Trusts Ordinance is an almost verbatim reproduction of the Indian

Trusts Act of 1882, but the amendments suggested by L.J.M.Cooray have gone a-

begging.

Resulting Trusts in Sections 83 and 84

12. Lord Upjohn explained resulting trusts in Vandervell v IRC4

Where A transfers, or directs a trustee for him to transfer, the legal estate in

property to B otherwise than for valuable consideration it is a question of the

intention of A in making the transfer whether B was to take beneficially or

on trust and, if the latter, on what trusts. If, as a matter of construction of the

document transferring the legal estate, it is possible to discern A's intentions, that

is an end of the matter, and no extraneous evidence is admissible to correct and

qualify his intentions so ascertained. But if, as in this case the document is silent,

then there is said to arise a resulting trust in favour of A. But this is only a

presumption and is easily rebutted. All relevant facts and circumstances can be

considered in order to ascertain A's intentions with a view to rebutting this

presumption.

13. David Hayton, in editing the 13th edition of Sir Underhill's Law of Trusts and Trustees

and relying on Re Vandervell's Trusts (No. 2)5 described the trust that arose in that

case as an automatic resulting trust to distinguish it from the presumed resulting trust

contemplated in Sections 83 and 84 of the Sri Lankan Trusts Ordinance. In the instant

appeal, we are not concerned with an automatic resulting trust as encountered in Re

Vandervell's Trusts (No. 2), but rather with a presumed resulting trust as provided

for in Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance.

14. According to the 20th Edition of this leading textbook on Trusts which now carries the

title Underhill and Hayton: Law of Trusts and Trustees,6 resulting trusts of property

may be imposed in the following circumstances:

(a) when property is transferred to a trustee, on trusts which do not wholly dispose

of the beneficial interest.

(b) when property is gratuitously transferred to another or purchased in the name

of another, and there is no evidence that the transferor or purchaser declared a

valid express trust in his own favour, or that he intended to make a gift or loan

or to abandon the property, in which case a presumption is made that the

transferor or purchaser did not intend the transferee to acquire beneficial

enjoyment of the property for himself, failure to rebut such presumption by the

transferee leading to the imposition of a resulting trust; or

(c) when money is lent on the basis that it will not become part of the borrower's

general assets, but must be applied for a specified purpose, a resulting trust

arising in the lender's favour from the moment of receipt that is defeasible by

the exercise of a power vested in the borrower to use the money for the purpose

Presumed Resulting Trusts in Sections 83 and 84

15. Paragraph (b) above outlines the principles reflected in Sections 83 and 84 of the Sri

Lankan Trusts Ordinance. Regarding the requirements of Section 83, where a resulting

trust arises, Underhill and Hayton provide the following interpretation:

When real or personal property is conveyed to a purchaser jointly with others, or

to one or more persons other than the purchaser, and he does not provide the

6 20th Edition (2022) at Articles 25 and 26 edited by Paul Matthews, Charles Mitchell, Jonathan Harris and Sinead Agnew.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 26 of 51

purchase money as lender, and he receives no consideration from the

grantees, and there is no evidence to show that he intended them to take

beneficially, the law presumes that he did not, and a failure by them to

rebut this presumption leads to a resulting trust.7

16. The crucial question then is whether evidence in this case shows that the transferor

did or did not intend to transfer the beneficial interest in the property, real or personal.

Undoubtedly, non-payment of consideration for the transfer will point to the intention

of the transferor but evidence that the transferor did not intend to make a gift of the

property to the transferee will also strengthen the presumption that the transferor did

intend to keep the beneficial interest in himself or herself.

Rebuttal of Presumed Intention by the Transferee

17. The presumed intention of a resulting trust that arises on evidence has to be rebutted

by the transferee in order to claim an absolute transfer. Otherwise, a presumption of

trust would continue to prevail in favor of the transferor. Sections 83 and 84 do not

lay down the relevant principles with specific reference to the presumption but leave

it to the Court to decide whether or not, in the attendant circumstances of the case

the transferee has received the beneficial interest.

18. Thus, there is a duty to inquire into the attendant circumstances to ascertain the

parties' intention. However, judges have not hesitated to rely on the presumption to

determine the nature and extent of the evidential burden placed on the parties. I will

address the burden of proof, but only after first examining the evidence. As previously

noted, Sections 102 and 103 of the Evidence Ordinance are instrumental in

7 (20th Edition, 2022) Division Three> Trusts Imposed by Law> Chapter 8>Resulting Trusts>Article 26.1

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 27 of 51

determining the allocation of the burden of proof between the parties. Upon a

synoptic consideration of all the facts in the case, it will become evident that even the

presumption expressed in Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance could be invoked to

ascertain the parties' intention. By "parties' intention," I refer to the common intention

shared between the sister and brother in this case. If their common intention was that

the transfer served solely to facilitate a loan for the brother, a resulting trust would

arise. However, if their common intention was a genuine sale, the sister would have

intended to transfer not only the legal title but also the beneficial interest.

When is a resulting trust under Section 83 imposed?

19. In Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington BC8 Lord Browne-Wilkinson

rejected the notion that the resulting trust is designed to reverse unjust enrichment

and declared that this type of trust gives effect to the common intention of the parties.

The transferor does not intend to part with the equitable interest and the recipient of

the property is also aware that he is not the intended beneficial owner. The trust is

imposed on the basis of the conscience of the recipient of the property.

20. It is these principles, which have not been fully grappled with in relation to the facts

of the case, that form the basis of my dissent.

Sections 83 and 84 embody English Law

21. On the applicability of English law to Sections 83 and 84 of the Trusts Ordinance,

Gratiaen J said the following in the context of a case that arose under Section 84.

Sections 83 and 84 of our Trusts Ordinance have introduced the English law

on this subject... Where a man purchases property in the name of (or transfers

8 (1996) AC 669.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 28 of 51

property to) a stranger, a resulting trust is presumed in favour of the purchaser (or

transferor); on the other hand, if the transfer is in the name of a child or one to

whom the purchaser or transferor then stood in loco parentis, there is no such

resulting trust but a presumption of advancement. The presumption may,

however, be rebutted, but it should not give way to slight circumstances.9

22. The reference to a "stranger" does not exclude a brother, as is the case with the

transferee in the instant appeal. The reasoning of Gratiaen J applies equally to any

transferee, including the 1st Defendant in this case. English law does not impose a

restriction limiting the transferee to a stranger except in the counter presumption of

advancement under Section 84.

23. To summarize the foregoing, Section 83 explicitly states that a transfer of property by

a transferor will be subject to a constructive trust only if, considering the attendant

circumstances, it cannot reasonably be inferred that the transferor intended to dispose

of the beneficial interest in the property.

24. The question then arises: what are the attendant circumstances in this case that

indicate whether the sister, as the transferor, did or did not intend to dispose of the

beneficial interest in her land?

25. If it is established on a balance of probability that the brother (the transferee) did not

provide consideration, this fact will serve as one of the attendant circumstances

pointing to the sisters true intention at the time she executed the deed of transfer.

Non-payment of consideration for the transfer is only one circumstance and there

may be other circumstances that may throw light on the intention of the transferor as

to whether she did or did not intend to pass the beneficial interest to the transferee.

26. Before I proceed to examine the evidence to ascertain the parties intention, let me

make a fleeting reference to the bifurcation of proprietary interests into those silos of

equity-legal and equitable interests.

Legal and Equitable Ownership

27. Historically, the separation of equitable ownership from legal ownership is at the core

of the English concept of trusts law. When the Charter of Justice 1801 declared the

Supreme Court to be a court of law and equity, the way was paved for the reception

of concepts of equity, including the distinction between legal and equitable

proprietary interests. The influence of equity became more pronounced when courts

of original civil jurisdiction also came to be regarded as courts of law and equity.10

Indian and Sri Lankan judges have repeatedly said that the distinction between

equitable and legal ownership forms no part of their legal system, because (unlike in

England) there have been no separate courts of law and equity in India or Sri Lanka.11

10 As Lord Haldane observed in Dodwell v John: under principles which have always obtained in Ceylon, law and equity have been administered by the same Courts as aspects of a single system (1918) 20 NLR 206, 211 (PC). See also Gavin v Hadden (Ceylon) [1871] UKPC 48.

11 As the Privy Council explained in the Indian case of A Krishna v Kumara K Deb (1869) 4 Bombay LR Oudh Cases 270, trusts law could operate without relying on the distinction between legal and equitable ownership of property because the Supreme Court of India was a court of law and equity. For instance, in a series of cases the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has recognised that an equitable lease would prevail over a forfeiture clause in a legal lease. See, for instance, Perera v Thalif (1904) 8 NLR 118; Perera v Perera (1907)10 NLR 230; and Sanoon v Theyvendera-Rajah (1963) 65 NLR 574.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 30 of 51

28. In an absolute transfer of property that is later declared as a resulting or a constructive

trust, the legal interest vests in the transferee (the trustee), while the equitable or

beneficial interest remains with the transferor (the beneficiary).

29. In the instant case before us, the legal interest has already vested in the brother (the

transferee) but the question is whether the equitable interest continues to reside in

the sister (the transferor)? If the attendant circumstances lead to the inference that the

sister did not intend to transfer the equitable or beneficial interest to the brother, that

interest remains with her. Consequently, a cause of action arises, allowing her to

demand that the transferee brother reconvey the land, thereby divesting himself of

legal title.

30. Before applying the established facts to the law, it is essential to identify the pivotal

questions that will determine the outcome of this case: Did the brother provide

consideration to the sister? Are there other attendant circumstances that negate

an intention to transfer the beneficial interest in the property?

31. These questions must be answered in light of the evidence offered by both the

Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant. I now turn to an analysis of that evidence.

The first witness for the Plaintiff

32. The first witness for the Plaintiff was her son who was quite acquainted with the

attendant circumstances surrounding the transfer of the Plaintiffs land in favor of the

1st Defendant. The son alluded to the purpose of the transfer - i.e the 1st Defendant

wanted the transfer in order to obtain a loan from his employers - the Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB). The CEB wanted a mortgage of a land as a security for the loan,

as the evolving evidence would reveal, and as the 1st Defendant did not have title to

a land that could be furnished as security, he approached his elder sister (the Plaintiff

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 31 of 51

in the case) and she voluntarily transferred the land to the younger brother (the 1st

Defendant).

33. The Plaintiff's son began by explaining the purpose of the transaction. A key item of

evidence that emerges from his testimony is his emphatic assertion that his uncle, the

1st Defendant, never provided consideration to his mother, the Plaintiff, for the transfer

of the property. In summary, this issue arises as payment for the land was the core

defence of the 1st Defendant.

34. He further testified that his mother (the Plaintiff) never intended to sell the land to her

brother-the 1st Defendant.

35. The evidence of non-payment for the transfer, along with the absence of any intention

to transfer the land in favor of the 1st Defendant, remained unchallenged during cross-

examination. Furthermore, the witness testified that the 1st Defendant exhibited a

willingness to re-transfer the land both at the time of transfer and thereafteran

assertion that also went unchallenged. This further reinforces the Plaintiff's account of

non-payment as more probable than not.

36. Does the absence of cross-examination on the emphatic assertion of non-payment

not establish a prima facie case of non-payment in terms of Section 102 of the

Evidence Ordinance?

37. This raises the question of burden of proof and its allocation between the sister and

the brother. I have already alluded to the presumption of a resulting trust arising under

Section 83 upon evidence of a gratuitous transfer of property and the necessity on the

part of the 1st Defendant to rebut this presumption (para 17). The question whether

the sister transferred the property without receiving any consideration from the

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 32 of 51

brother has to be determined upon evidence led and for this purpose I now turn to

the evidence of the 2nd witness for the Plaintiff namely her daughter.

Second Witness for the Plaintiff.

38. The second witness for the Plaintiff is her daughter, who was shown the deed dated 2

May 1990. At the time of its execution, she was 17 years of age. She claimed to be well

acquainted with the background of the transaction, asserting that the transfer was

made to facilitate a loan for the 1st Defendant, with the understanding that the

property would be reconveyed to her mother once the loan installments had been

repaid to the CEB.

39. Like the first witness, she emphasized that no consideration was paid for the transfer.

She further supported this assertion by referring to the attestation clause in the deed,

which forecasts a prospective payment to be made by the CEB to her mother. The

relevant attestation clause states as follows:

I further certify and attest that the within mentioned consideration will be paid

to the vendor by the Ceylon Electricity Board Provident Fund Society.

40. The Plaintiffs evidence also asserts that the aforesaid promise in the attestation clause

- referring to a future payment after the execution of the deed - was never fulfilled.

However, at this stage, I must also observe that the 1st Defendant claimed that the

Plaintiff was paid by a cheque issued by the CEB, as stipulated in the attestation clause.

To support this assertion, he summoned a witness from the CEB to establish proof of

payment. In contrast, the Plaintiff and her witnesses unequivocally stated from the

witness box that no such payment was ever made to her.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 33 of 51

41. These conflicting versions must be assessed for their testimonial credibility, and I will

apply evaluative tools commonly used in the assessment of evidence to determine

their reliability.

42. The overall tenor of the examination-in-chief of the Plaintiff's second witness was that

her uncle, the 1st Defendant, repeatedly declared his intention to retransfer the land

to her mother. In furtherance of this, they even visited a lawyer's office to effect the

retransfer. However, the 1st Defendant ultimately thwarted these attempts by

demanding a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs as a condition for executing the retransfer.

43. The witness also referred to the episode in which the 1st Defendant handed over a

copy of the deed of transfer in his name to her mother after repeated pleas from her

mother to retransfer the land. At this stage, I would classify this as subsequent conduct

under Section 8(2) of the Evidence Ordinance, influenced by the fact in issuenamely,

whether the sister ever intended to transfer the beneficial interest of the property to

the brother. The subsequent act of handing back a copy of the deed is inconsistent

with the behavior of a person who possessed a beneficial interest in the property. An

individual who claims to hold both the legal title and beneficial interest in a property

would not have relinquished the deed to the sister, whose assertion of non-transfer

of the beneficial interest is corroborated by the very act of the 1st Defendant brother.

44. This very same evidence is also given by the Plaintiff in her testimony, albeit with a key

distinction. According to the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant returned the original deed to

her after its execution. This assertion further reinforces the Plaintiffs position that she

never intended to transfer the beneficial interest to her brother. The fundamental

question that arises is this: Why would the 1st Defendant return his own title deed to his

sister if he truly held both legal title and beneficial interest in the property? His conduct

is at odds with such a claim.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 34 of 51

45. When confronted with this inconsistency, the 1st Defendant attempted to provide an

explanation rather belatedly in his evidence-in-chief. At this juncture, I must interpose

to note that his evidence which I will address shortly is replete with new versions

that were never put to the Plaintiff's witnesses.

46. In his examination-in-chief, the 1st Defendant explained that the Plaintiffs first

witnessher sonhad badgered him into selling the land to them and that the

agreed consideration for the reconveyance was a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs. However, I must

observe that this appears to be an entirely new case introduced by the 1st Defendant

in his evidence, as this stance was never suggested to the Plaintiff or her witnesses,

least of all to her son, who was allegedly pressuring his uncle.

47. Therefore, the evidence given by the Plaintiff's witnessesthat he returned the

original deed of sale out of a sense of compunction, seeking to dispel any suspicion

that he was attempting to wrongfully appropriate the property from his sister

remains unchallenged. His newly introduced claim that he was engaged in discussions

regarding a possible sale must be regarded with the incredulity it warrants.

48. The Privy Council has stated that the real tests for either accepting or rejecting

evidence are how consistent is the story with itself, how it stands the test of cross-

examination, how far it fits in with the rest of the evidence and the circumstances of

the case - Bhoj Raj vs. Sita Ram.12 In deciding on the credibility of witnesses, it is also

necessary to ascertain whether they agree in their testimony-consistency inter se. If

one examines the cross-examination of the Plaintiffs witnesses, it becomes evident

that none of the positions later adopted by the 1st Defendant in his evidence-in-chief

were ever put to them. This omission casts serious doubt on the testimonial credibility

12 A.I.R. 1936 P C 60

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 35 of 51

of the 1st Defendants belated assertions. Accordingly, I reject this defense, introduced

for the first time during his examination-in-chief.

49. With due respect to my learned brother, he does not appear to assess the 1st

Defendant's belated defense through the forensic and evaluative tools available to

this Courtnamely, the inherent inconsistency, improbability and belatedness that

undermine the 1st Defendants case. The belated versions put forward by the 1st

Defendant undermine his case and in Evidence & Advocacy13 Peter Murphy & David

Barnard point out that cross-examination has two purposes: to challenge the evidence

in chief insofar as it conflicts with your instructions; and to elicit facts favorable to your

case which have not emerged, or which were insufficiently emphasized in chief. The

cross examiner in the case was innocent of the two purposes as I proceed to dissect

the evidence.

50. It is axiomatic that the words or conduct of a transferee carry greater evidential weight

when they are explicitly brought to their attention, yet they fail to protest or challenge

them at the time. Such a failure to repudiate the words or conduct attributed to the

transferee casts a serious doubt over the credibility of any contrary versions they later

put forth.

51. Having thus examined the subsequent conduct of the 1st Defendant and its impact on

his testimonial credibility, I now turn to the testimony of the Plaintiff.

Plaintiffs Testimony

52. Having pleaded and placed a denial of actual payment of consideration at the

forefront of her case, the Plaintiff reiterated this assertion multiple times during both

her examination-in-chief and cross-examination. At the time of giving evidence, she

13 Fifth Edition (1998) at p 182.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 36 of 51

was residing at her daughters house, which is situated adjacent to the land in

questionproperty over which the 1st Defendant claims absolute title. The Plaintiff

testified that the transfer of land to the 1st Defendant was not intended to be an

outright sale but a temporary arrangement to facilitate his loan application with his

employer, the CEB. She emphasized that the transfer was made at her brothers

request, without any financial consideration, and based on his promise to reconvey

the land upon settling his liability to the CEB.

53. Despite the land being part of a larger parcel, it was never fenced or otherwise

demarcated to grant exclusive possession to the 1st Defendant. This claim was

reinforced by the testimony of her son and daughter, who confirmed that possession

was never intended to be relinquished. The Plaintiff remained unequivocal in her

stance that she never intended to transfer ownership permanently.

54. Next, she spoke of the misgivings she harbored due to the 1st Defendants reluctance

to reconvey the land. As a consequence of these concerns, she went so far as to

register a caveat, which was duly marked in evidence.

55. She also visited the office of a lawyer for the purpose of having the land reconveyed

to her but her brother demanded money for the retransfer and stymied that attempt.

She also stated that the 1st Defendant did not come into possession of the lot which

had been transferred to him

56. As for the alleged payment of a cheque in her favor by the CEB, the Plaintiff firmly

denied receiving any such cheque. She stated that she had never engaged in cheque

transactions, as she maintained only a savings account. Moreover, she emphasized

that whenever she visited the bank, she was always accompanied by either her son or

daughter. She classified the story of payment by cheque as a falsehood.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 37 of 51

57. As previously highlighted by me, she also mentioned in her evidence the delivery of

the original title deeds by her brother. I pointed this out as subsequent conduct of the

1st Defendant, which I further classify as an implicit admission that she never

relinquished her beneficial beneficial interest in the property. His explanation that it

was as a result of an ongoing negotiation to sell the land is unworthy of credit as this

was not suggested to any of the witnesses including the Plaintiff.

Observations on the evidence of the Plaintiff

58. It must be borne in mind that neither the Plaintiff nor her daughter was ever

challenged on their assertions regarding the subsequent conduct of the 1st Defendant

in delivering the original deed of salea conduct indicative of his recognition of the

Plaintiffs beneficial interest in the property. The unchallenged evidence remains that

he visited the office of a lawyer to sign a deed intended to reconvey the land to the

Plaintiff. His claim that this visit was necessitated by ongoing negotiations to sell the

land lacks credibility, as this position was never put to the Plaintiffs witnesses.

59. The Plaintiff further testified that the 1st Defendant was never admitted into possession

of the land, which measured 10 perches, and her firm deposition to this effect

remained unchallenged in cross-examination. This uncontradicted evidence strongly

indicates that the Plaintiff continued to possess the land, whether constructively or

otherwise. Both the Plaintiff and her daughter consistently testified that they had

planted trees on the land, and this claim, too, was left unchallenged in cross-

examination. Having failed to challenge these two witnesseswho remained steadfast

in their assertions that the 1st Defendant never took possession of the land despite the

salethe 1st Defendant, in his testimony, belatedly attempted to claim that he had

planted the trees. Significantly, his evidence in chief contained no assertion of

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 38 of 51

exclusive possession of the land. This serves as a strong indication that the beneficial

interest in the property remained with the Plaintiff.

60. Moreover, the oral promise to reconvey the land was the overriding tenor of the

Plaintiffs evidence, and this crucial aspect of her testimony was not seriously

impugned during cross-examination.

61. All this uncontradicted evidence brings to mind a long line of cases affirming the

distilled wisdom articulated by H.N.G. Fernando C.J. in Edrick de Silva v Chandradasa

de Silva,14 later followed in cases such as Cinemas Ltd v Sounderarajan.15 His

observations underscore that when a Plaintiff leads evidence that remains

uncontradicted by the Defendant in the case, such evidence becomes an additional

"matter before the Court" as contemplated by the definition in Section 3 of the

Evidence Ordinance. In other words, proof under Section 3 is not confined solely to

oral, documentary, or real evidence. Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, the author of both

the Indian Evidence Act and our own, deliberately employs the term matters in

defining proof of a fact under Section 3thereby encompassing even uncontradicted

evidence.

62. Unchallenged and unimpugned evidence assumes the character of proved evidence

as to the fact spoken to by witnesses, and any belated attempt to contradict such

evidence in ones own testimonywithout having put forward and made known ones

position earlierlacks credibility. This fundamental rule must be borne in mind by all

cross-examining counsel, and the counsel for the 1st Defendant, having disregarded

it, failed to establish proof of the 1st Defendants case, if his version were true. This

principle, commonly referred to as the rule in Browne v Dunn, derives its name from

the 19th - century case.

63. Denning J. in Miller v. Minister of Pensions16 stated :-

If the evidence is such that the tribunal can say: we think it more probable than

not, the burden is discharged, but, if the probabilities are equal, it is not.

64. In civil cases the test is not whether one partys version is more probable than the

other partys for it may be that neither version of events is credible-see Rhesa

Shipping v. Edmunds17.

The party bearing the burden will discharge it only if the tribunal of fact is satisfied

that his version of events is more probable than any alternative version.

65. However, the phrase balance of probabilities is often employed as a convenient

phrase to express the basis upon which civil issues are decided but the test says

nothing about how far above 50 per cent the probability should be that his version of

events is correct.

66. One theory holds that anything over 50 per cent suffices, no matter what the nature

of the allegation (the so-called 51 per cent test-see Davies v. Taylor18).

67. The only matter on which the Plaintiff was cross-examined concerned the payment

purportedly made by the CEB to the Plaintiff. It is worthy of note that the Plaintiff

consistently denied receiving such payment, and even her witnesses testified that their

mother had not been paid. Counsel for the 1st Defendant attempted to cross-examine

the Plaintiff on the contents of an answer filed by the 2nd Defendant (CEB), who had

by then been discharged from the proceedings. In these circumstances, the material

contained in the answer would amount to hearsay and could not serve as proof of the

alleged payment by the CEB.

68. The renowned dicta of Honorable L.M. De Silva J, delivered in Subramaniam v the

Public Prosecutor19 while sitting in the Privy Council, established that an out-of-court

statement cannot serve as proof of its contents unless supported by direct evidence

or falling within an exception to the hearsay rule. Merely because the answer filed by

the CEB indicated that a cheque had been drawn in favour of one Iranganie, it does

not prove the truth of the implied assertion sought to be made that the proceeds of

the cheque reached the account of the Plaintiff. Unless a copy of the cheque and

voucher were put to the Plaintiff in cross examination, the Plaintiffs evidence that no

payment by way of a cheque was made to her has to be accepted on the foundational

principle given in paragraph 61 of this judgement.

69. Even the witness from the CEB who had nothing to do with the drawing of the cheque

or its purported delivery to the Plaintiff could not say with certainty that the proceeds

of the cheque had reached the Plaintiff. Then who was the recipient of this money?

The 1st Defendant could not have left this issue in a state of uncertainty and doubt. If

he had personal knowledge of the person to whom the proceeds of the cheque went,

it was his bounden duty to bring it to the fore in court.

70. Thus, there is a serious doubt that arises in the case presented by the 1st Defendant.

The only line of cross examination undertaken of the Plaintiff focused on the alleged

payment of consideration for the transfer which was denied by the Plaintiff, whereas

the core of the Plaintiff's case appears to be focused on a purposeful conveyance that

19 (1956) 1 WLR 965

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 41 of 51

did not seek to vest beneficial interest in the 1st Defendant. If at all, the testimony as

spoken to by the Plaintiff and her witnesses is that a conveyance in the name of the

1st Defendant was effected only for the purpose of facilitating a loan for him upon his

oral promise to retransfer.

71. When the Plaintiff alluded to the oral promise on the part of the brother to retransfer

the land, she was not seriously challenged on that attendant circumstance that goes

to prove that the 1st Defendant did make an oral promise to retransfer the land.

72. Having made these preliminary observations I would now turn to the evidence for the

Defendant and briefly touch upon how he fared in the witness box.

Evidence led on behalf of the 1st Defendant.

73. I have already highlighted some items of evidence proffered by the 1st Defendant and

I have said that the testimony of the 1st Defendant is replete with new material that

was not put to the Plaintiff and her witnesses. For instance, the 1st Defendant speaks

of taking the Plaintiff to the CEB in order to secure the cheque for her. He also stated

that he was not however present at the time when the cheque was allegedly handed

over to her. This visit to the CEB was never put to the Plaintiff or her witnesses. Thus,

serious misgivings arise in regard to the testimonial trustworthiness of the story of

payment allegedly made by the CEB to the Plaintiff.

74. It is important to observe that the Plaintiff unequivocally denied receiving any cheque

from the CEB when giving evidence. She maintained that she only had a savings

account implying that she could not have engaged in cheque transactions. She further

stated that she did not hold a current account, suggesting that she lacked the means

to receive the cheque proceeds. Moreover, during cross-examination, it was never

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 42 of 51

suggested that her savings account had received the proceeds of the alleged cheque,

nor was a copy of the cheque shown to her.

75. As regards the burden of proof, which I will address shortly in this judgment, I am of

the view that it rests on the 1st Defendant to establish payment. It is critical to his case

to prove that payment was made, thereby resulting in a valid sale to him. The burden

of proving the payment of consideration, if any, lies with the 1st Defendant, and the

circumstances I have highlighted raise serious doubt as to whether such payment

occurred. The Plaintiff testified that she did not have a current account, and if a cheque

had indeed been credited to her savings account, the 1st Defendant failed to call any

officer from either the paying or collecting bank to confirm that the cheque proceeds

were received by the Plaintiff through her bank account. It is not difficult for the CEB

to establish to whom its money had been dispatched by its bank - the Peoples Bank.

76. If the attestation clause of the transfer deed states that the consideration of the

transfer would be paid by the CEB to the Plaintiff, it is the burden of the vendee to

prove that the consideration was paid to her. The only witness summoned by the 1st

Defendant to establish the payment of a cheque was the secretary / accountant who

served in the EPF department of the CEB. Admittedly, this witness was nowhere there

when the CEB allegedly made this payment to the Plaintiff. The witness was giving

evidence from a file which was maintained in relation to the loan of the 1st Defendant.

77. The witness from the CEB who was summoned by the 1st Defendant referred to a

voucher which had been allegedly signed by one Iranganie - a name that the Plaintiff

bears. However, this voucher was not put to the Plaintiff when the Plaintiff was giving

evidence. Certified copies of the documents in the files were available to the 1st

Defendant but he chose not to confront the Plaintiff with the actual documents. This

omission is grievous and does not identify with unerring accuracy the identity of the

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 43 of 51

person who had allegedly received the payment. This omission to elicit and establish

the true identity of the real payee becomes more pronounced in light of the fact that

the Plaintiff had vehemently rejected all suggestions of payment and moreover, there

was a culpable omission to suggest to her that she went with the brother to the CEB

to receive the proceeds of the loan obtained by the 1st Defendant.

78. Did Iranganie (the Plaintiff) personally receive the payment, or was it collected on his

behalf by someone else? This is the brooding question as there is uncontradicted

evidence that the Plaintiff did not go to the CEB to receive the cheque? If Iranganie

(the Plaintiff) had not gone to receive the alleged cheque and there is no evidence

that her account received the funds of CEB, who pocketed the funds of the CEB? This

looms large in the case and the person who asserted the payment was bound to have

established this fact. If this evidence was withheld from Court, the corollary follows i.e

the presumption of fact embodied in Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance may

be drawn against the 1st Defendant.

79. The witness from the CEB could not establish that the cheque was paid in the account

of the Plaintiff. He stated that he could not state with certainty as to who had been

paid.

80. If a cheque had been credited to the account of the Plaintiff, it would not have been

impossible for the CEB to obtain the details of the person who had encashed the

cheque.

81. Thus, there is no proof that the Plaintiff was handed over a cheque. Though the

voucher contained a signature bearing the name Iranganie, it was never shown to the

Plaintiff and the identity of the recipient of the cheque was never established on a

balance of probability.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 44 of 51

82. In the teeth of the denials made by the Plaintiff that she was ever paid by a cheque, it

was imperative on the part of the 1st Defendant to have conclusively established that

the proceeds of the cheque were received by the Plaintiff. The officer from the CEB

refreshed his memory from a file maintained at the CEB and he was not the author or

had any personal knowledge of the recipient of the cheque.

83. If the 1st Defendant claims to have taken his sister to the CEB to procure the payment

for her, it is contrary to human nature that he was not around at the crucial moment

when she allegedly collected the cheque.

84. The 1st Defendant had personal knowledge of the path of payment but he failed

grievously to establish that it was his sister who received the payment. The paying

bank - the Peoples Bank could have been noticed to supply the deficiency.

85. In the light of this overwhelming evidence against the 1st Defendant, Section 114 (f)

of the Evidence Ordinance should be invoked against him and it is fatuous to invite

this Court to draw this presumption against the Plaintiff. In light of the items of

evidence I have highlighted and the serious omission on the part of the 1st Defendant

to prove by cogent evidence that his employer CEB paid consideration to the Plaintiff,

my brother could not have used Section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance to draw

adverse inferences against the Plaintiff because it was not the burden of the Plaintiff

to establish the proof of payment and it was indeed the burden of the 1st Defendant

to establish the proof of payment. He sought to do so but failed to lead material

evidence resulting in the consequence of the presumption being drawn against the

1st Defendant himself.

86. Now that I have demonstrated that on a balance of probability the case of the Plaintiff

outweighs that of the 1st Defendant and it becomes necessary to rationalize my

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 45 of 51

reasoning on the evidence having regard to the provisions dealing with burden of

proof and the law thereon.

Burden of Proof

87. A Defendant who claims to have purchased the Plaintiffs land with a loan from his

employer and produces the relevant monthly statement from the paying bank at trial

could have easily established that the cheque payment by his employer was credited

to the Plaintiffs account. Just as the 1st Defendant in this case presented a witness

from the CEB who stated that, based on the monthly statement, he could not confirm

to whom the cheque was paid, the Defendant could have procured the necessary

information regarding the payee by obtaining it from his employer, CEBthe drawer

of the chequeor by subpoenaing the bank to testify about the destination of the

cheque proceeds.

Proving a negative

88. Since it was the 1st Defendant asserting the payment, and the Plaintiff was asserting a

negativenamely, non-paymentit is trite law that the Plaintiff cannot be called

upon to prove a negative. Based on the rule of Roman Law - ei incumbit probatio,

qui dicit, non qui negat - the burden of proving a fact rests on party who

substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue and not upon the party who denies it,

for a negative does not admit of direct and simple proof. see the Indian case of

Ranutrol Industries Limited v. Mr. Nauched Singh and Anr.20

89. In the aforesaid case, there was a dispute between a company and its employee,

regarding his dismissal. The learned counsel appearing for the company stated that

20 Writ petition (civil) No 1478/2008

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 46 of 51

the "Labour Court has not addressed the issue that proper enquiry has not been held.

According to him, in the light of this issue, the onus of proving the lack of proper

enquiry lay upon the workman and that there is nothing in the impugned award to

show that this aspect of the matter has been considered by the Labour Court.

90. Justice Sudershan Kumar Misra observed that:

"A reading of the impugned award clearly shows that the workman had made a

categoric statement that his service had been terminated without any enquiry and

in violation of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act and that no notice or

notice pay or retrenchment compensation had been given to him. As stated in the

Latin maxim Ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat i.e., onus of proof

lies upon him who affirms, and not upon him who denies the existence of

any fact. It is the management who averred that the requisite enquiry had, in

fact, been held. Therefore, it was for the management to prove that fact. In this

context, the Labour Court has duly noted the fact that despite a number of

opportunities being granted to the management, it has failed to produce any

evidence of a fair and valid inquiry.

91. Identical views were expressed in other Indian cases-see New Indian Assurance

Company Ltd v. Nusli Neville Wadiya21 where the Supreme Court of India alluded

to the pervasive principle behind Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance that the

burden of proving a fact rests on the party who substantially asserts the affirmative

of the issue and not upon the party who denies it, for a negative is usually incapable

of proof.22

21 (2008) 3 Supreme Court Cases 279: (2008) 1 Supreme Court Cases (Civ) 850: 2007 SCCC OnLine SC 1540

22 Ei qui affirmat non ei qui negat incumbit probatio

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 47 of 51

92. In such circumstances, where a prima facie case of non-payment has emerged before

the court, the relevant evidencesuch as the identity of the recipient of the cheque

and its proceedsmust come from the proponent of the assertion of payment,

namely the 1st Defendant. A culpable failure to discharge this burden arises if the 1st

Defendant withholds such evidence. In that event, Section 114 enables the court to

draw a presumption that, if produced, the said payment particulars would have been

unfavorable to the 1st Defendant. This is why the failure to prove the recipients identity

becomes relevant. As I said before, there is only evidence that a cheque had been

drawn in the name of one Irangainie. There is not a scintilla of acceptable evidence

that the cheque was handed over to the Plaintiff or credited to her savings account.

93. When the Plaintiff denied receiving payment and this evidence was corroborated by

the son and daughter, the Plaintiff furnished a prima facie case of non-payment. Then

the burden shifted to the 1st Defendant to adduce evidence of payment as he asserted

payment. As the date and amount paid were within his exclusive knowledge, he must

plead and prove the same in terms of S. 106 of the Evidence Ordinance. The entries in

the books should have been put to the Plaintiff and they have been skillfully hidden

from her.

94. All in all. the prima facie evidence of non-payment has not been rebutted by the 1st

Defendant and it is for this reason that even the onus set out in the provisions dealing

with burden of proof has not been discharged by him.

95. There is also another aspect that looms large in this case namely failure to cross

examine the Plaintiff on material particulars as well as a grievous omission to put

matters to the Plaintiff, which the 1st Defendant spoke to only in his examination in

chief.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 48 of 51

96. To sum up, Professor Peter Murphy, Professor of Law, South Texas College of Law

made a significantly important pronouncement in his book on the necessity to cross

examine a witness and suggest to the witness the matters that are in favour of the

cross-examining party-the 1st Defendant in this instance.

There are two direct consequences of a failure to cross examine a witness. One is

purely evidential in that, failure to cross-examine a witness who has given

relevant evidence for the other side is held technically to an acceptance of the

witnesss evidence in chief. The other is a tactical one but no less important for

that. Where a partys case has not been put to witnesses called for the other side,

who might reasonably have been expected to be able to deal with it, that party

himself will probably be asked in cross examination why he is giving evidence

about matters which were never put in cross examination on his behalf.23

97. Even in his other work, viz. "A Practical Approach to Evidence, having considered

the effect of omission to cross-examine a witness on a material point Peter Murphy

states the same as above.

It is, therefore, not open to a party to impugn in a closing speech or otherwise, the

unchallenged evidence of a witness called by his opponent or even to seek to

explain to the tribunal of fact the reason for the failure to cross-examine.24

Accordingly, it is counsels duty, in every case:

(a) to challenge every part of a witnesss evidence which runs contrary to his own

instructions; (b) to put to the witness, in terms, any allegation against him which

must be made in the proper conduct of the defence; (c) to put to the witness

23 Peter Murphy on Evidence, 8th Ed., p. 597-598,

24 A Practical Approach to Evidence at page 444,

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 49 of 51

counsels own case, in so far the witness is apparently able to assist with relevant

matters or would be so able, given the truth of the counsels case."

To proceed with the quotation from Peter Murphy:

"The second consequence of failure to cross-examine is a tactical one but no less

important for that. Where a partys case" had not been put to witnesses called for

the other side, who might reasonably have been expected to be able to deal with

it that party himself will probably be asked in cross-examination why he is giving

evidence about matters which were never put in cross-examination on his behalf.

The implication of the question is that the party is fabricating evidence in the

witness-box, because if he has ever mentioned the matters in question to his legal

advisers, then they would have been put on his behalf at the proper time."25

98. All this goes to prove that the 1st Defendant grievously failed to prove the payment of

consideration.

99. Apart from the above, as I have pointed out, there are other attendant circumstances

that unambiguously point to the fact that the sister did not have the intention to

transfer the beneficial interest to the brother. The fact that the 1st Defendant did not

go into possession of the property coupled with his subsequent conduct of handing

back the original deed for retransfer remained uncontradicted and as Peter Murphy

25 In this connection see C.A.Case No 20/99 Athambawa Uthumanachi v Mohamed Thamby Asiya Umma (D.C.Kalmunai No 2079/L) decided on 20.06.2018 ; Also see CA Kananke Acharige Mithrananda (5th Defendant-Appellant) v Manage Sardajeewa and Others CA C.A. Case No. 722/1999 (F) D.C. Tangalle Case No. P/3194 delivered on 06.05.2019.

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 50 of 51

sounded the caveat, a number of new versions were taken up by the 1st Defendant

only in his examination in chief.

100. I must pinpoint a stark reality and a sad consequence the Plaintiff faces if justice is not

meted out in her favor. She never intended to transfer the beneficial ownership of the

property to her brother, and, moreover, no payment was made by him for the

property. The Plaintiff faces the bleak future of losing not only her land but also the

money which should have been paid if it was a genuine sale. I do not think that this

Court exercising good conscience and equity can permit such injustice to be

perpetrated against the Plaintiff. As Lord Browne-Wilkinson stated in Westdeutsche

Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington (supra), a resulting trust is imposed on the basis

of the unconscionable conduct of the recipient of the property and I feel compelled

to observe that the owner of the property-the Plaintiff believed and had legitimate

expectations that her property would be returned.

101. On the facts of the case a resulting trust arises on the basis of the common intention

of the parties and there is no doubt that the brother was well aware that the property

must be returned to the sister. In the circumstances, I hold quite compellingly that a

declaration of trust must be made in favour of the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant must

be ordered to return the property back to the sister, as it is inequitable for the 1st

Defendant to appropriate and convert it illegally as his own.

102. I have already pointed out that it is quite stultifying to remit the case back, as the Civil

Appellate High Court Judges erroneously decided to remand it to the District Court

for the taking of further evidence. The record contains substantial evidence

demonstrating the attendant circumstances, which clearly indicate that the beneficial

interest in the property was not transferred to the brother. Accordingly, I set aside the

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)

SC Appeal 169/15 JUDGMENT Page 51 of 51

order to remand the case to the District Court but the judgement of the Civil Appellate

High Court declaring a constructive trust in favor of the Plaintiff is hereby affirmed.

103. The decision of the District Court is set aside and all questions of law are answered in

favour of the Plaintiff. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the appeal of the 1st Defendant-

Respondent-Appellant.
