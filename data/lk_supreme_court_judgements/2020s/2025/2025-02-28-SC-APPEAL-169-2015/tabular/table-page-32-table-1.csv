"","brother has to be determined upon evidence led and for this purpose I now turn to"
"","the evidence of the 2nd witness for the Plaintiff namely her daughter."
"","Second Witness for the Plaintiff."
"38.","The second witness for the Plaintiff is her daughter, who was shown the deed dated 2"
"","May 1990. At the time of its execution, she was 17 years of age. She claimed to be well"
"","acquainted  with  the  background  of  the  transaction,  asserting  that  the  transfer  was"
"","made  to  facilitate  a  loan  for  the  1st  Defendant,  with  the  understanding  that  the"
"","property  would  be  reconveyed  to  her  mother  once  the  loan  installments  had  been"
"","repaid to the CEB."
"39.","Like the first witness, she emphasized that no consideration was paid for the transfer."
"","She further supported this assertion by referring to the attestation clause in the deed,"
"","which  forecasts  a  prospective  payment  to  be  made  by  the  CEB  to  her  mother.  The"
"","relevant attestation clause states as follows:"
"","“I further certify and attest that the within mentioned consideration will be paid"
"","to the vendor by the Ceylon Electricity Board Provident Fund Society”."
"40.","The Plaintiff’s evidence also asserts that the aforesaid promise in the attestation clause"
"","- referring to a future payment after the execution of the deed - was never fulfilled."
"","However,  at  this  stage,  I  must  also  observe  that  the  1st  Defendant  claimed  that  the"
"","Plaintiff was paid by a cheque issued by the CEB, as stipulated in the attestation clause."
"","To support this assertion, he summoned a witness from the CEB to establish proof of"
"","payment.  In  contrast,  the  Plaintiff  and  her  witnesses  unequivocally  stated  from  the"
"","witness box that no such payment was ever made to her."
