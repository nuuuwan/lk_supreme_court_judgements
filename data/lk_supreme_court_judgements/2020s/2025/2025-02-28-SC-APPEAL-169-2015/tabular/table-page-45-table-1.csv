"","Burden of Proof"
"87.","A Defendant who claims to  have purchased the Plaintiff’s land with a loan from his"
"","employer and produces the relevant monthly statement from the paying bank at trial"
"","could have easily established that the cheque payment by his employer was credited"
"","to  the  Plaintiff’s  account.  Just  as  the  1st Defendant  in  this  case  presented  a  witness"
"","from the CEB who stated that, based on the monthly statement, he could not confirm"
"","to  whom  the  cheque  was  paid,  the  Defendant  could  have  procured  the  necessary"
"","information regarding the payee by obtaining it from his employer, CEB—the drawer"
"","of the cheque—or  by subpoenaing the bank to testify about the destination  of the"
"","cheque proceeds."
"","Proving a negative"
"88.","Since it was the 1st Defendant asserting the payment, and the Plaintiff was asserting a"
"","negative—namely,  non-payment—it  is  trite  law  that  the  Plaintiff  cannot  be  called"

"","qui  dicit,  non  qui  negat’  -  the  burden  of  proving  a  fact  rests  on  party  who"
"","substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue and not upon the party who denies it,"
"","for  a  negative  does  not  admit  of  direct  and  simple  proof.    see  the  Indian  case  of"
