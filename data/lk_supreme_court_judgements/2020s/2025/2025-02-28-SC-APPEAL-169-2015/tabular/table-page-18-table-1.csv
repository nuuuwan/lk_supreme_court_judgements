"","her  brother  in  respect  of  Deed  No.  1527  has  been  duly  completed  has  not"
"","proved.”?12"
"53.","This  question  of  law  is  clearly  related  to  the  third  question  of  law.  As  previously"
"","discussed,  since 
the  Plaintiff  has  asserted 
in  her  Plaint 
that 
the  1st  Defendant"
"","enchashed the cheque, the burden of proving the same is on the Plaintiff. However,"
"","no evidence has been adduced to this effect."
"54.","The 1st Defendant-Respondent-Respondent in his Written Submissions asserted that"
"","the Plaintiff has made no attempt to call a witness from the People’s Bank to prove"
"","her assertion, despite having all opportunity to do so.13 The Counsel also invited the"
"","Court to consider the presumption set out in Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance"
"","in this regard."
"55.","Considering the aforementioned, I am of the opinion that learned Judges of the Civil"
"","Appellate High Court have erred in holding that the transaction between the Plaintiff"
"","and her brother had not been duly proven."
"56.","Accordingly, I answer the final question of law in the affirmative."
