"45.  When confronted with this inconsistency, the 1st Defendant attempted to provide an",""
"","explanation rather belatedly in his evidence-in-chief. At this juncture, I must interpose"
"","to note that his evidence— which I will address shortly— is replete with new versions"
"","that were never put to the Plaintiff's witnesses."
"46.","In  his  examination-in-chief,  the  1st  Defendant  explained  that  the  Plaintiff’s 
first"
"","witness—her  son—had  badgered  him  into  selling  the  land  to  them  and  that  the"
"","agreed consideration for the reconveyance was a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs. However, I must"
"","observe that this appears to be an entirely new case introduced by the 1st Defendant"
"","in his evidence, as this stance was never suggested to the Plaintiff or her witnesses,"
"","least of all to her son, who was allegedly pressuring his uncle."
"47.","Therefore,  the  evidence  given  by  the  Plaintiff's  witnesses—that  he  returned  the"
"","original deed of sale out of a sense of compunction, seeking to dispel any suspicion"
"","that  he  was  attempting  to  wrongfully  appropriate  the  property  from  his  sister—"
"","remains unchallenged. His newly introduced claim that he was engaged in discussions"
"","regarding a possible sale must be regarded with the incredulity it warrants."
"48.","The  Privy  Council  has  stated  that  the  real  tests  for  either  accepting  or  rejecting"
"","evidence  are how  consistent is the story with itself, how it  stands the test of cross-"
"","examination, how far it fits in with the rest of the evidence and the circumstances of"
"","the case - Bhoj Raj vs. Sita Ram.12 In deciding on the credibility of witnesses, it is also"
"","necessary to ascertain whether they agree in  their testimony-consistency inter se. If"
"","one  examines  the  cross-examination  of  the  Plaintiff’s  witnesses,  it  becomes  evident"
"","that none of the positions later adopted by the 1st Defendant in his evidence-in-chief"
"","were ever put to them. This omission casts serious doubt on the testimonial credibility"
