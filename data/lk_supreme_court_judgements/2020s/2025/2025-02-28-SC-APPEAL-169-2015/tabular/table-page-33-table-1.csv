"41.","These conflicting versions must be assessed for their testimonial credibility, and I will"
"","apply  evaluative  tools  commonly  used  in  the  assessment  of  evidence  to  determine"
"","their reliability."
"42.","The overall tenor of the examination-in-chief of the Plaintiff's second witness was that"
"","her uncle, the 1st Defendant, repeatedly declared his intention to retransfer the land"
"","to her mother. In furtherance of this, they even visited a lawyer's office to effect the"
"","retransfer.  However, 
the  1st  Defendant  ultimately 
thwarted 
these  attempts  by"
"","demanding a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs as a condition for executing the retransfer."
"43.","The  witness  also  referred  to  the  episode  in  which  the  1st Defendant  handed  over  a"
"","copy of the deed of transfer in his name to her mother after repeated pleas from her"
"","mother to retransfer the land. At this stage, I would classify this as subsequent conduct"
"","under Section 8(2) of the Evidence Ordinance, influenced by the fact in issue—namely,"
"","whether the sister ever intended to transfer the beneficial interest of the property to"
"","the brother. The subsequent act of handing back a copy of the deed is inconsistent"
"","with the behavior of a person who possessed a beneficial interest in the property. An"
"","individual who claims to hold both the legal title and beneficial interest in a property"
"","would not have relinquished the deed to the sister, whose assertion of non-transfer"
"","of the beneficial interest is corroborated by the very act of the 1st Defendant brother."
"44.","This very same evidence is also given by the Plaintiff in her testimony, albeit with a key"
"","distinction. According to the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant returned the original deed to"
"","her after its execution. This assertion further reinforces the Plaintiff’s position that she"
"","never  intended  to  transfer  the  beneficial  interest  to  her  brother.  The  fundamental"
"","question that arises is this: Why would the 1st Defendant return his own title deed to his"
"","sister if he truly held both legal title and beneficial interest in the property? His conduct"
"","is at odds with such a claim."
