"","that Their Lordships have solely based their decision to order a retrial on the finding"
"","that the judge who gave the judgment has not had the opportunity to hear any of the"
"","witnesses."
"16.","The judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court indicates that the Court has taken into"
"","account the submission of the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent that the demeanor of"
"","witnesses 
in  the 
instant  case 
is  extremely 
important  to  be  considered  as  case"
"","depended largely on the factual evidence given by the parties in open court. The Court"
"","has 
also 
taken 
into 
consideration 
the 
contention  of 
the  Plaintiff-Appellant-"
"","Respondent that none of the witness testified before the District Judge who gave the"
"","judgment, which is factually inaccurate as already observed."
"17.","As apparent from the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, this appear to be"
"","the  basis  of  ordering  a  retrial  as  no  other  reasons  are  set  out  therein.  As  such,  the"
"","learned Judges have ordered a retrial based on a manifestly erroneous finding."
"18.","Therefore, the second question of law, too, is answered in the affirmative."
