"","the land in suit has never been passed to the 1st Defendant. This is corroborated by"
"","the  evidence  of  the  first  and  second  witnesses.  The  two  witnesses  as  well  as  the"
"","Plaintiff also state that the 1st Defendant has not taken any steps to develop the land"
"","which he claims to have bought for the purpose of building a house."
"50.","The 1st Defendant, in his testimony before the District Court, states that he bought the"
"","land intending to build a house and every intention of developing the property.  He"
"","has produced a document marked  ‘වි  4’ to establish that he sought approval from"
"","the Kotikawatte Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha to develop the land. He states, he was"
"","informed that 25 ft from the boundary of the Kolonnawa Canal (වකාවළාන්නාෙ  ඇළ),"
"","which is adjacent to the land in suit, must be set aside for the purpose of conservation."
"","He  states  that  once  25  ft  are  set  aside  there  was  no  room  to  build  a  house  and"
"","therefore, he had given up on developing the land and built a house on a different"
"","land. He further claims to have erected a fence there and planted several trees, which"
"","the other witnesses deny."
"51.","The document marked ‘වි 4’ gives an indication of an intention on the part of the 1st"
"","Defendant to  develop the land in suit. In addition, as the 1st Defendant himself has"
"","admitted in his testimony, the Deed of Transfer marked ‘පැ 1’ was in possession of"
"","the  Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent  at  the  time  of  filing  action  before  the  District"
"","Court. However, the 1st Defendant states that he handed over the Deed of Transfer"
"","marked  ‘පැ  1’  to  his  nephew  in  order  to  prepare  a  new  deed  of  transfer  after  his"
"","nephew showed interest to buy the land for Rs. 500,000/-."
