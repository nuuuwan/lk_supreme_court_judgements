"Resulting Trusts in Sections 83 and 84"
"Lord Upjohn explained resulting trusts in Vandervell v IRC4"
"Where  A transfers,  or  directs  a  trustee  for  him  to transfer,  the  legal  estate  in"
"property  to  B  otherwise  than  for  valuable  consideration  it  is  a  question  of  the"
"intention  of  A  in  making  the transfer whether  B  was  to  take  beneficially  or"
"on trust and, if  the  latter,  on  what trusts.  If,  as  a  matter  of construction  of  the"
"document transferring the legal estate, it is possible to discern A's intentions, that"
"is an end of the matter, and no extraneous evidence is admissible to correct and"
"qualify his intentions so ascertained. But if, as in this case â€¦ the document is silent,"
"then  there  is  said  to  arise  a resulting trust in  favour  of  A.  But  this  is  only  a"
"presumption and is easily rebutted. All relevant facts and circumstances can be"
"considered  in  order  to  ascertain  A's  intentions  with  a  view  to  rebutting  this"
