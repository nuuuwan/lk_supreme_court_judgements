"","resulting 
trust  but  a  presumption  of  advancement.  The  presumption  may,"
"","however, be rebutted, but it should not give way to slight circumstances.9"
"22.","The  reference  to  a  ""stranger""  does  not  exclude  a  brother,  as  is  the  case  with  the"
"","transferee in the instant appeal.  The reasoning of Gratiaen J applies equally to any"
"","transferee,  including  the  1st  Defendant  in  this  case.  English  law  does  not  impose  a"
"","restriction limiting the transferee to a stranger except in the counter presumption of"
"","advancement under Section 84."
"23.","To summarize the foregoing, Section 83 explicitly states that a transfer of property by"
"","a transferor will be subject to a constructive  trust only if, considering the attendant"
"","circumstances, it cannot reasonably be inferred that the transferor intended to dispose"
"","of the beneficial interest in the property."
"24.","The  question  then  arises:  what  are  the  attendant  circumstances  in  this  case  that"
"","indicate whether the sister, as the transferor, did or did not intend to dispose of the"
"","beneficial interest in her land?"
"25.","If it is established on a balance of probability that the brother (the transferee) did not"
"","provide  consideration,  this  fact  will  serve  as  one  of  the  attendant  circumstances"
"","pointing to the sisterâ€™s true intention at the time she executed the deed of transfer."
"","Non-payment  of  consideration  for  the  transfer  is  only  one  circumstance  and  there"
"","may be other circumstances that may throw light on the intention of the transferor as"
"","to whether she did or did not intend to pass the beneficial interest to the transferee."
