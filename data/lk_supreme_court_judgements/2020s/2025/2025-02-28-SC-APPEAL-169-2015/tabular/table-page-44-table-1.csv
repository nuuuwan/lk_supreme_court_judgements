"82.","In the teeth of the denials made by the Plaintiff that she was ever paid by a cheque, it"
"","was imperative on the part of the 1st Defendant to have conclusively established that"
"","the proceeds of the cheque were received by the Plaintiff. The officer from the CEB"
"","refreshed his memory from a file maintained at the CEB and he was not the author or"
"","had any personal knowledge of the recipient of the cheque."
"83.","If the 1st Defendant claims to have taken his sister to the CEB to procure the payment"
"","for her, it is contrary to human nature that he was not around at the crucial moment"
"","when she allegedly collected the cheque."
"84.","The  1st  Defendant  had  personal  knowledge  of  the  path  of  payment  but  he  failed"
"","grievously  to  establish  that  it  was  his  sister  who  received  the  payment.  The  paying"
"","bank - the Peopleâ€™s Bank could have been noticed to supply the deficiency."
"85.","In the light of this overwhelming evidence against the 1st Defendant, Section 114 (f)"
"","of the Evidence Ordinance should be invoked against him and it is fatuous to invite"
"","this  Court  to  draw  this  presumption  against  the  Plaintiff.  In  light  of  the  items  of"
"","evidence I have highlighted and the serious omission on the part of the 1st Defendant"
"","to prove by cogent evidence that his employer CEB paid consideration to the Plaintiff,"
"","my brother could not have  used Section 114 (f) of the Evidence Ordinance to  draw"
"","adverse inferences against the Plaintiff because it was not the burden of the Plaintiff"
"","to establish the proof of payment and it was indeed the burden of the 1st Defendant"
"","to  establish  the  proof  of  payment.  He  sought  to  do  so  but  failed  to  lead  material"
"","evidence resulting in the consequence of the presumption being drawn against the"
"","1st Defendant himself."
