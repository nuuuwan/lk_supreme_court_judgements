"92.","In such circumstances, where a prima facie case of non-payment has emerged before"
"","the court, the relevant evidence—such as the identity of the recipient of the cheque"
"","and  its  proceeds—must  come  from  the  proponent  of  the  assertion  of  payment,"
"","namely the 1st Defendant. A culpable failure to discharge this burden arises if the 1st"
"","Defendant withholds such evidence. In that event, Section 114 enables the court to"
"","draw a presumption that, if produced, the said payment particulars would have been"
"","unfavorable to the 1st Defendant. This is why the failure to prove the recipient’s identity"
"","becomes  relevant.  As  I  said  before,  there  is  only  evidence  that  a  cheque  had  been"
"","drawn in the name of one Irangainie. There is not a scintilla of acceptable evidence"
"","that the cheque was handed over to the Plaintiff or credited to her savings account."
