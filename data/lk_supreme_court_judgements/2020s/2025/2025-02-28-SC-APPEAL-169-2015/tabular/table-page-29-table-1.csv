"26.","Before I proceed to examine the evidence to  ascertain the partiesâ€™ intention, let me"
"","make a fleeting reference to the bifurcation of proprietary interests into those silos of"
"","equity-legal and equitable interests."
"","Legal and Equitable Ownership"
"27.  Historically, the separation of equitable ownership from legal ownership is at the core",""
"","of the English concept of trusts law. When the Charter of Justice 1801 declared the"
"","Supreme Court to be a court of law and equity, the way was paved for the reception"
"","of  concepts  of  equity, 
including 
the  distinction  between 
legal  and  equitable"
"","proprietary interests. The influence of equity became more pronounced when courts"
"","of  original  civil  jurisdiction  also  came  to  be  regarded  as  courts  of  law  and  equity.10"
"","Indian  and  Sri  Lankan  judges  have  repeatedly  said  that  the  distinction  between"
"","equitable and legal ownership forms no part of their legal system, because (unlike in"
"","England) there have been no separate courts of law and equity in India or Sri Lanka.11"
"","10  As  Lord  Haldane  observed  in  Dodwell  v  John:  under  principles  which  have"
"","always obtained in Ceylon, law and equity have been administered by the same"
"","Courts as aspects of a single system (1918) 20 NLR 206, 211 (PC). See also Gavin"
"","v Hadden (Ceylon) [1871] UKPC 48."
"","11 As the Privy Council explained in the Indian case of  A Krishna v Kumara K"
"","Deb (1869) 4 Bombay LR Oudh Cases 270, trusts law could operate without relying"
"","on the distinction between legal and equitable ownership of property because the"
"","Supreme Court of India was a court of law and equity. For instance, in a series of"
"","cases the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka has recognised that an equitable lease would"
"","prevail over a forfeiture clause in a legal lease. See, for instance, Perera v Thalif"
"","(1904)  8  NLR  118;  Perera  v  Perera 
(1907)10  NLR  230;  and  Sanoon  v"
