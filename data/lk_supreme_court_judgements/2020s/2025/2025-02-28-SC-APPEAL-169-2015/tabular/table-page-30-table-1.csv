"","A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J (Dissenting)"
"28.","In an absolute transfer of property that is later declared as a resulting or a constructive"
"","trust,  the  legal  interest  vests  in  the  transferee  (the  trustee),  while  the  equitable  or"
"","beneficial interest remains with the transferor (the beneficiary)."
"29.","In the instant case before us, the legal interest has already vested in the brother (the"
"","transferee) but the question is whether the equitable interest continues to reside in"
"","the sister (the transferor)? If the attendant circumstances lead to the inference that the"
"","sister did not intend to transfer the equitable or beneficial interest to the brother, that"
"","interest  remains  with  her.  Consequently,  a  cause  of  action  arises,  allowing  her  to"
"","demand that the transferee  brother reconvey the land, thereby divesting himself of"
"","legal title."
"30.","Before applying the established facts to the law, it is essential to identify the pivotal"
"","questions  that  will  determine  the  outcome  of  this  case:  Did  the  brother  provide"
"","consideration to the sister? Are there other attendant circumstances that negate"
"","an intention to transfer the beneficial interest in the property?"
"31.","These  questions  must  be  answered  in  light  of  the  evidence  offered  by  both  the"
"","Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant. I now turn to an analysis of that evidence."
