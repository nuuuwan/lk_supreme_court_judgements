"3.","The case of the 1st Defendant brother is that soon after the transfer of the land to him"
"","by  the  sister,  he  mortgaged  the  property  to  the  2nd  Defendant  (the  CEB)  for  the"
"","purpose of obtaining a loan but the proceeds of the loan were all paid to the Plaintiff"
"","sister as consideration for the transfer. The assertion is that the consideration was paid"
"","to the sister by a cheque issued in her favor by the CEB."
"4.","So,  the  quintessential  question  is  whether  consideration  was  paid  for  the  transfer."
"","Whilst  the  sister’s  case  was  one  of  non-payment  of  consideration  along  with  other"
"","attendant circumstances, the brother asserted payment. The learned District Judge of"
"","Colombo by his judgment dated 24 April 2009 dismissed the case of the Plaintiff sister"
"","holding  inter  alia  that  the  Plaintiff  had  failed  to  establish  her  contention  of  non-"
"","payment,  whilst  the  appeal  preferred  by  the  Plaintiff  sister  was  allowed  by  the  Civil"
"","Appellate High Court of the Western Province."
"5.","The Civil Appellate High Court Judges ruled in favor of a constructive trust, holding"
"","that the 1st Defendant  had failed to  provide  evidence that the payment  in  question"
"","had  been  duly  made  to  the  Plaintiff.  Consequently,  the  1st Defendant  has  appealed"
"","this  judgment  to  this  Court.  However,  the  Civil  Appellate  Judges  also  issued  an"
"","inconsistent order remanding the case for a re-trial—an exercise in futility, as I will"
"","demonstrate."
"6.","When  conflicting  claims  regarding  payment  or  non-payment  of  consideration  arise"
"","between the parties, the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, 1895, determine the"
"","allocation  of the burden of  proof. In this context, Sections 101, 102 and 103, along"
"","with  other 
relevant  provisions  of 
the  Evidence  Ordinance,  become  applicable."
"","Accordingly, the key issue that arises is how the burden of proof should be distributed"
"","between the sister and brother in this particular case."
