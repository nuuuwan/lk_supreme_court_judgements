"","Trusts Act, 1882 and Sri Lankan Trusts Ordinance No. 9 of 1917 reveals that Section"
"","82  of  our  legislation  is  pari  materia  with  Section  81  of  the  Indian  Trusts  Act,  1882."
"","However,  while  our  Chapter 
IX

titled 
'Constructive 
Trusts’,

"10.","The  omission  of  any  reference  to  ""constructive  trusts""  in  the  Indian  Trusts  Act  is"
"","intentional and understandable. Both the Indian  legislation and the Sri Lanka Trusts"
"","Ordinance recognize the concepts of resulting and constructive trusts as understood"
"","in English law. However, the Trusts Ordinance, somewhat infelicitously, refers only to"
"","""Constructive  Trusts""  in  Chapter  IX,  whereas  the  Indian  Trusts  Act  omits  explicit"
"","mention of either resulting or constructive trusts in its corresponding Chapter IX. Due"
"","to  this  discrepancy,  the  distinguished  jurist  L.J.M.  Cooray,  in  his  treatise,  suggested"
"","that 
the  phrase  “obligations 
in 
the  nature  of 
trusts”  might  have  been  a  more"
"","appropriate heading for Chapter IX than “constructive trusts.”3"
"11.","The reason is discernible. Both Sections 83 and 84 of the Trusts Ordinance embody"
"","the English law concept of resulting trusts rather than constructive trusts. It cannot be"
"","gainsaid that the Trusts Ordinance is an almost verbatim reproduction of the Indian"
"","Trusts  Act  of  1882,  but  the  amendments  suggested  by  L.J.M.Cooray  have  gone  a-"
