"The next step is for Court to be satisfied that the provisions of Section 31(1) - (4) have"
"been complied with."
"T
he answer to the core issue is found in Section 31(6) which reads as follows:"
"“Where an application is made under subsection (1) of this section, and"
"t
here is no application for the setting aside of such award under section 32, or"
"t
he court sees no cause to refuse the recognition and enforcement of such award"
"under the provisions contained in sections 33 and 34 of this Act,"
"i
t shall, on a day of which notice shall be given to the parties,"
"p
roceed  to  file  the  award  and  give  judgment  according  to  the  award.  Upon  the"
"judgment so given a decree shall be entered.”"
"S
ections 33 and 34 deal with foreign arbitral awards and has no relevance to this appeal."
"O
n  a  plain  reading  of  Section  31(6),  once  an  application  is  filed  to  enforce  an  arbitral"
"award  which  is  not  a  foreign  arbitral  award,  the  High  Court  shall  issue  notice  on  the"
"respondent. If, by then, an application to set aside the award has already been filed, the"
"High  Court  shall  proceed  to  consolidate  both  applications  and  hear  them  together,  as"
"required by Section 35(1) of the Act. In that scenario, while the grounds set out in Section"
"32(1)(a) and (b) which are pleaded in the application for setting aside can be urged by the"
"party who is  seeking  to  set  aside  the  award, the  Court  must  also  be  satisfied that  the"
"provisions of Section 31(1)-(4) have been complied with."
"I
f there is no application pending before the High Court for the setting aside of the said"
"award or the period of sixty days as contemplated by Section 32(1) has lapsed, the High"
"Court shall proceed to file the said award and give judgment according to the award. Thus,"
"on the face of Section 31(6), in such a situation, the party against whom enforcement is"
"sought is entitled only to notice of such application for enforcement, but such party shall"
"not have the right to object to enforcement on the grounds set out in Section 32(1). This"
"was the view taken in Hatton National Bank v Sella Hennadige Chandrasiri [SC Appeal"
"No. 63/2013; SC minutes of 15th October 2015], and in A. R. Wimalasiri and Another v."
"Property Finance and Investments Kandy (Private) Limited [SC Appeal No. 100/2008; SC"
"minutes of 9th November 2015]."
