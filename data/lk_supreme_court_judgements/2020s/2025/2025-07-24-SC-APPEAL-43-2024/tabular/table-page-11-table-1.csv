"The parties also have the opportunity of choosing an arbitrator with particular technical"
"or  legal  expertise  and  who  is  therefore  better  suited  to  grasp  the  intricacies  of  the"
"particular  dispute.  Furthermore,  parties  have  the  freedom  to  custom  design  arbitral"
"procedures, which thereby ensures an efficient and expeditious process. This is reflected"
"in  Section  17  of  the  Act  in  terms  of  which  the  parties  shall  be  free  to  agree  on  the"
"procedure to be followed by the tribunal in conducting the proceedings."
