"T
he judgment does not divulge the necessity for the High Court to peruse the proceedings"
"of  1st  March,  2016,  nor  has  the  High  Court  expressed  any  concerns  that  it  would  be"
"contrary to the public policy of Sri Lanka to enforce the Award."
"I
t however appears from the above reasoning that the High Court was influenced by the"
"unsubstantiated averments in the Objections that, (a) the matter had been settled, (b)"
"the Appellant had acted fraudulently by suppressing this fact from the Tribunal, and (c)"
"the Award has been obtained by fraud. The High Court has lost sight of the fact that the"
"Respondent (a) has admitted that she received the notice of arbitration and the notice"
"served  by  the  Centre  informing  her  to  be  present  before  the  Tribunal  on  26th  January"
"2016, and (b) appeared before the Tribunal on that date and having submitted herself to"
"the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, participated at the hearing held on 26th January 2016, and"

"been  adjourned,  although  the  Centre  has  done  so  as  a  matter  of  courtesy.  It  was  the"
"responsibility  of  the  Respondent  to  act  diligently  and  participate  in  the  proceedings"
"before the Tribunal or else face the risk of the matter proceeding ex parte."
"T

"been  tendered  by the  Appellant  to  the  High  Court  and  is available  in  the  original case"
"record. The proceedings of 1st March 2016 bear out the fact that, (a) the Respondent was"
"present before the Tribunal on 1st March 2016, (b) the Tribunal was informed that the"
"“parties have agreed to the terms of settlement”, and (c) the matter was adjourned to 9th"
"March 2016 to enter terms of settlement."
