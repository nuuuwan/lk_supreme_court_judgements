"dispute  is  not  capable  of  settlement  by  arbitration  under  the  law  of  the  State  where"
"enforcement is sought, or the award is in conflict with the public policy of that State."
"R
ecognition  and  enforcement  of  arbitral  awards  is  provided  for  in  Chapter  VIII  of  the"
"Model Law. In terms of Article 35(1), “An arbitral award, irrespective of the country in"
"which it was made, shall be recognised as binding and, upon application in writing to the"
"competent court, shall be enforced subject to the provisions of this article and of article"
"36.”  In  terms  of  Article  36(1)(a),  “Recognition  or  enforcement  of  an  arbitral  award,"
"irrespective of the country in which it was made, may be refused only at the request of"
"the party against whom it is invoked, if that party furnishes to the competent court where"
"recognition or enforcement is sought proof” of the grounds set out in paragraphs (i) – (v)"
"thereof. Of these five paragraphs, the first four paragraphs are identical to the paragraphs"
"in  Article  34(2)(a). Article  36(1)(b)  contains two further grounds  which  are identical  to"
"those set out in Article 34(2)(b) referred to above."
"T
hus, on a plain reading of Articles 34 and 36 of the Model Law, it appears that an award"
"can be set aside as well as its enforcement refused, at the request of the party against"
"whom the award has been made, with the grounds for doing so being almost identical."
"What is important is that the Model Law does not appear to provide for Court acting ex"
"mero motu and setting aside or refusing enforcement of an award."
"E
nforcement of an arbitral award – the Act"
"T
he provisions in the Act relating to enforcement of an award are found inter alia in three"
"sections, namely Sections 31, 33 and 34."
"S
ection 31(1) of the Act provides that,  “A party to an arbitration agreement pursuant to"
"which an arbitral award is made may, within one year after the expiry of fourteen days of"
"the making of the award, apply to the High Court for the enforcement of the award”. The"
"said Section does not draw a distinction between an award made in Sri Lanka or a foreign"
"arbitral  award,  and  therefore  whether  it  be  a  foreign  arbitral  award  or  otherwise,  the"
"procedure  for  making  an  application  for  enforcement,  and  the  applicability  of  the"
"provisions of Section 31(1)-(4) to such application are the same."
