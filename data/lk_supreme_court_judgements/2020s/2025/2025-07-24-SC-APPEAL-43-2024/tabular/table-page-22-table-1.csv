"n the latter case, Sisira De Abrew, J stated that:"
"“In my view, if the Appellant Municipal Council failed to make an application under"
"section 32 of the Act, it cannot, in an application for enforcement of the award under"
"Section 31 of the Act, move the High Court to set aside the award. In the case of local"
"arbitration, High Court is not obliged, in an application under Section 31 of the Act,"
"to consider an application for the setting aside of an award if the affected party had"
"failed  to  make  an  application  under  section  32  of  the  Act. In  an  application  for"
"enforcement of an arbitral award, High court must be satisfied on following matters"
"that, 1. there is no application for the setting aside of the award under Section 32 of"
"the Act or 2. the court sees no cause to refuse the recognition and enforcement of"
"the  award  under  the  provisions  of  Section  33  and  34  of  the  Act. It  is  noted  that"
"Sections  33  and  34  of  the  Act  deal  with  foreign  arbitration. The  case  that  I  am"
"considering is a local arbitration. Therefore the High Court must be satisfied only on"
"the 1st ground set out above.”"
