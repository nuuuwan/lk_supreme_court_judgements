"on its own as provided for in Section 32(1)(b), but its findings will be circumscribed by"
"what is set out in the application for setting aside and the material attached thereto. I"
"must also state that if an application for enforcement has been made, the High Court shall"
"consolidate the two applications."
"I
 may also add that a party in whose favour an award has been made but who does not"
"file an application for enforcement in terms of Section 31(1) cannot move to enforce such"
"award through the objections filed in an application for setting aside an award. This was"
"the  position  that  arose  in  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority  v  Daya  Constructions  (Private)"
"Limited [supra] where Janak De Silva, J held that, “the jurisdiction of the High Court in an"
"application  made  under  Section  32(1)  of  the  Act  is  limited  to  considering  whether  an"
"arbitral award should be set aside. There is a patent lack of jurisdiction which prevents a"
"High  Court  from  considering  whether  the  award  should  be  enforced  in  an  application"
"made pursuant to Section 32(1) to set aside that award.”"
"T
he scope of Section 31 of the Act"
"W
hile it is mandatory for a party who wishes to set aside an award to file an application"
"under Section 32(1) and furnish the material relied upon by such party, what rights does"
"the Act confer on a party who has not filed an application for setting aside within sixty"
"days of the receipt of the award, at the time enforcement of such award is sought by the"
"successful party? That brings me to the core issue in this appeal, that being the extent to"
"which a party who has not filed a setting aside application can participate in enforcement"
"proceedings before the High Court."
"T
he starting point to finding an answer to this issue is Section 31(1) which requires a party"
"who wishes to enforce an award to make an application by way of a petition supported"
"by an affidavit – vide Section 40(1). In terms of Section 31(2), the said application shall be"
"accompanied  by  the  original  or  a  duly  certified  copy  of  (a)  the  award,  and  (b)  the"
"arbitration agreement under which the award has been made. Section 40(1) requires the"
"respondent to be issued notice of such application. As provided by Section 40(2), Court"
"shall  appoint  a  day  for  the  determination  of  the  matter  in  the  petition  and  grant  the"
"respondent a date to state their objections, if any, in writing, supported by an affidavit."
