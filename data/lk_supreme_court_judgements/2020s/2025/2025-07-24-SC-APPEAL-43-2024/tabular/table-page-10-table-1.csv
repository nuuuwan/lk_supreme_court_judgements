"(3)  Whether  the  Commercial  High  Court  has  the 
jurisdiction  to  consider  the  said"
"Statement of Objections under Section 31(6) of the Act?"
"I
n my view, the above questions of law brings into focus the following two issues:"
"(
a) 
The right of a person against whom an arbitral award has been made and who has"
"not filed an application to set aside the said award to participate in an application"
"for enforcement of such award."
"(
b) 
The role of the High Court when called upon to enforce an award including the right"
"of the High Court to call for documents over and above those specified in Section"
"31(2) of the Act."
"A
rbitration, party autonomy and minimum curial intervention"
"I
n order to give context to the decisions that I will be reaching with regard to the above"
"questions and issues, I shall commence by  considering the principal of party autonomy"
"and the recognition thereof by Court."
"A
rbitration is a method of alternative dispute resolution that is chosen by the parties to"
"an  agreement  in  order  to  provide  them  with  an  expeditious  and  binding  resolution  of"
"disputes  that  may  arise  under  their  agreement  by  obviating  the  complexities  of  the"
"cumbersome, 
  expensive  and 
time  consuming 
traditional  court  process.  Modern"
"arbitration  law  prioritizes  the  power  of  the  arbitral  tribunal  to  decide  on  the  disputes"
"referred to it, including the power to decide on its own jurisdiction, and accordingly, an"
"arbitral award, once made, is binding on the parties and enforceable without delay, both"
"nationally and internationally. It is acknowledged that the United Nations Convention on"
"the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958, better known as the"
"New  York  Convention  and  to  which  over  170  countries  are  parties,  have  contributed"
"significantly 
in  arbitration  becoming 
the  preferred  mode  of  settling 
international"
"commercial disputes."
"A
rbitration offers the parties a realistic choice to resolve their disputes at a pace they are"
"comfortable with. Given that parties to an international commercial contract often come"
"from different countries, arbitration allows the parties to settle disputes in a forum and"
"before a tribunal that is neutral and not connected to either partyâ€™s home jurisdiction."
