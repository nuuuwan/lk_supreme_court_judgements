"considering is a local arbitration. Therefore the High Court must be satisfied only on"
"the 1st ground set out above.”"
"Thus, this Court has adopted a strict approach in dealing with the right of a party who"
"does not file an application for the setting aside of an award to object to enforcement."
"One  must,  however,  give effect to  the  stipulation  in  Section 40(2) that a party against"
"whom an application has been made has a right to object to such application. In these"
"circumstances, I am of the view that in an application under Section 31(1), such right to"
"object shall be limited to raising an objection relating to the non-fulfilment of any of the"
"grounds set out in Section 31(1) – (4), and no more. In other words, resort cannot be had"
"in the objections filed to an application under Section 31 to any of the grounds in Section"
"32(1), with the only objection that can be raised being that the petition, affidavit and the"
"documents attached thereto are not in terms of Section 31(1) – (4), or that what is before"
"Court is not an original or a duly certified copy of the agreement to arbitrate or the award."
