"(4) have been complied with, prior to proceeding to Section 31(6)."
"I
 must, perhaps for the sake of completeness, refer to Section 35(2) which provides that,"
"“Where an application to set aside the award under Section 32 has been refused, the Court"
"shall not permit a party to an arbitration to object to the enforcement of the award on"
"any of the grounds specified in Section 34.” One could therefore argue that Section 35(2)"
"appears to suggest that the grounds in Section 34 are available to a party who makes an"
"application under Section 32, and therefore the reference in Section 31(6) to Section 34"
"is not limited to applications for enforcement of foreign arbitral awards but extends to"
"domestic awards, which then means the party against whom an award is sought to be"
"enforced can invoke the grounds set out in Section 34(1), even though he has not made"
"an application for setting aside. Section 34 however is clearly  limited to foreign arbitral"
"awards, and adopting a holistic view of the Act , to extend it to domestic awards is to do"
"violence  to  the  scheme  in  the  Act  relating  to  the  enforcement  of  a  domestic  arbitral"
