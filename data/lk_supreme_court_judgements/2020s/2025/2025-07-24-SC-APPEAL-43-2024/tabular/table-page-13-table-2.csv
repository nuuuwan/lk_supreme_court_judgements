"award is contrary to the public policy of Sri Lanka. Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC,"
"having recognised that in order to consider the argument of public policy the Court may"
"have to revisit some of the factual matters raised before the arbitral tribunal, stated that:"
"“ … it is noteworthy to observe at this stage, that the re-examination of some of the"
"facts, circumstances and issues by the High Court or by this Court per se cannot be"
"construed as a process that undermines the party autonomy in arbitral proceedings."
"The Act which governs the conduct of arbitration proceedings itself recognises the"
"jurisdiction of the High Court to set aside an arbitral award on the ground “that the"
"arbitral  award  is  in  conflict  with  the  public  policy  of  Sri  Lanka”.  In  exercising  this"
"jurisdiction, the High Court and / or the Supreme Court may have to examine certain"
"issues that had already been determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. Such examination"
"will have to be limited to the extent that is necessary to determine the issue whether"
"the award is in conflict with public policy. However, when exercising the jurisdiction"
"in  such  an  instance  it  is  important  to  be  mindful  that  the  law  does  not  make"
"provision  for  a  judicial  review  of  the  arbitral  award,  by  way  of  exercising  the"
"appellate or revisionary jurisdiction of the court. The examination should be limited"
"to the extent necessary to determine whether the award is in conflict with the public"
"policy  of Sri Lanka.  The Court has  no  jurisdiction  to set  aside the  arbitral  award"
"merely on the ground that the Arbitral Tribunal has committed errors of fact and"
"/ or law in making the award.” [emphasis added]"
