"Furthermore,  even  if  the  Respondent  did  pay  the  said  sums  of  money  as  part  of  a"
"settlement, the above sums of money could not have resulted in the full settlement of"
"the sums claimed from the Arbitral Tribunal nor the monthly lease rental of Rs. 65,344"
"that  the  Respondent  was  required  to  pay.  The  fact  that  a  settlement  had  not  been"
"reached in spite of discussions having taken place is further confirmed by the proceedings"
"before the High Court where the parties had discussed a settlement. It is therefore clear"
"that  the  Respondent  had  not  substantiated  the  allegations  of  fraud  and  that  she  was"
"clearly trying to mislead Court."
"T
his attempt by the Respondent to mislead the High Court seems to have been successful"
"for the reason that, despite the above infirmities with the version of the Respondent, it is"
"clear from the impugned judgment that the High Court was disturbed by the allegation of"
"the  Respondent  that  the  award  has  been  obtained  by  fraud.  The  High  Court  had"
"accordingly directed  the Appellant  to  produce  the  proceedings of  1st March  2016  and,"
"solely on the basis that the Appellant failed to produce such proceedings, dismissed the"
"application filed by the Appellant for the enforcement of the Award."
