"Thus, taken in conjunc(cid:415)on with P12, I am of  the view that  the contractual rela(cid:415)onship"
"between the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ and the 1st Defendant and the inten(cid:415)on to create legal rela(cid:415)ons is"
"clearly borne out by P2, P3 and P11. It is on this basis that the High Court rejected the"
"argument  of  the 1st Defendant that  (a) he did  not  have  any  ﬁnancial  dealings with  the"
"Plain(cid:415)ﬀ, (b) he did not make a wri(cid:425)en request for a loan of Rs. 5,200,000, and (c) that he"
"did not receive any monies under and in terms of P2 and P3."
