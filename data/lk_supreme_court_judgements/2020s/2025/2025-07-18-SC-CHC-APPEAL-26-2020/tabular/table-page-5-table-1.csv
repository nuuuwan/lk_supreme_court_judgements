"Judgment of the High Court"
"T
here is one observa(cid:415)on that I must make prior to referring to the ﬁndings of the High"
"Court. Most of the documents marked by the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ, including P2 and P3 the signature"
"of  which  by the  1st  Defendant  was recorded  as  a formal admission, have  been  marked"
"subject  to  proof.  However,  the  proceedings  do  not  bear  out  the  reason  for  the  said"
"documents to be marked subject to proof. I must state that objec(cid:415)ng to every possible"
"document  marked  by  the  opposing  party  without  having  any  reason  for  doing  so  or"
"moving that documents be marked subject to proof has now become a common prac(cid:415)ce"
"and is one of the factors that have contributed to delays witnessed in our Courts. While"
"A(cid:425)orneys-at-Law  must  desist  from  raising  frivolous  objec(cid:415)ons  when  documents  are"
"marked by the opposing Counsel, and while an applica(cid:415)on that a document be marked"
"subject to proof must always be substan(cid:415)ated with reasons, the trial Judge too must insist"
"on reasons being adduced if a party wishes to object to a document being marked and"
"immediately decide on such objec(cid:415)on. I am op(cid:415)mis(cid:415)c that this prac(cid:415)ce can be curtailed"
"in cases where the pre-trial provisions introduced by the Civil Procedure (Amendment)"
