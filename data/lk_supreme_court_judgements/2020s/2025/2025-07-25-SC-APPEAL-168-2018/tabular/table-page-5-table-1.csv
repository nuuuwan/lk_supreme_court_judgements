"During the hearing of the instant appeal, learned Counsel for the 4th"
"accused  strongly  urged  before  this  Court  that  the  evidence  presented  by"
"the  prosecution  in  itself  indicative  of  a  sudden  fight,  that  had  erupted"
"between  the  deceased  and  the  four  accused,  but  the  Courts  below  have"
"fallen  into  a  common  but  a  serious  error,  in  failing  to  consider  that  vital"

"should  have  been  afforded  with  the  benefit  of  sudden  fight,  as  it  would"

"Penal  Code,  which  makes  him  guilty  not  to  the  offence  of  murder  but  to"
"the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder."
