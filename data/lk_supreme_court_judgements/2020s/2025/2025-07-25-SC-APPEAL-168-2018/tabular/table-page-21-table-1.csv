"S.C. Appeal No.168/2018"
"The witness candidly admitted that the father of the 1st accused too"
"came to the place of attack in order to make a failed attempt to intervene."
"The  witness  however  denied  that  the  others  who  gathered  around  have"
"tried  to  prevent  the  deceased  from  stabbing  the  4th  accused.  Thereupon,"
"the 4th accused suggested to Amali that the deceased, after disregarding the"
"intervention by an elderly person, has made an attempt to stab him and, in"
"order  to protect himself  from  stabbing, he  has  picked  up  a  wooden  fence"
"post from a nearby fence and hit the deceased once with it. The 4th accused"
"suggested that, in doing so,  he exercised his right of  private  defence. The"
"reply  of  the  witness  to  the  said  suggestion,  which  was  founded  on  the"
"premise that there was a sudden fight, was to deny the same. She further"
"added that nothing of that sort ever happened."
