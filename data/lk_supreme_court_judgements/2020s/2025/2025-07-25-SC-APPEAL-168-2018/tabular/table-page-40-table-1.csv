"deceased. It is an indication of the swift and surprise attack unleashed by"
"the four accused on the deceased, before the latter being clubbed to death"
"by the 4th accused."
"What is important to note from the above description and analysis of"
"the evidence is the fact that there was no ‘fight’ between the deceased and"
"the four accused, though the assault on him seemed to be a sudden one. Of"
"course,  the  prosecution  did  not  present  any  evidence  pointing 
in  the"
"direction that the attack on the deceased is a premeditated one where the"
"four  accused  have  planned  out  the  details  or  have  acted  in  prior  concert."
"No  one  could  have  predicted  that  the  deceased  to  come  out  of  his  house"
"and walk up to the group of men, who were standing on the other side of"
"the  road.  The  stomach  contents  of  500  grams  of  rice,  noted  by 
the"
"consultant JMO, indicate that the deceased was just after his lunch and, as"
"the  eye  witness  opined  during  cross  examination, 
that  he  may  have"
"walked up to the accused perhaps to mediate the dispute or to pacify the"
"obviously agitated men."
"It could easily be understood as to why the 4th accused now cling on"
"to  the  position  that  there  was  a  sudden  fight  during  which  he  too  was"
"stabbed  by  the  deceased.  Even  if  the  4th  accused  could  establish  that  he"
"was  stabbed  by  the  deceased  ‘after  the  incident’  ,  the  evidence  failed  to"
"establish  that  there  was  a  sudden  fight,  in  terms  of  the  Exception  4  of"
"Section  294  of  the  Penal  Code.  I  shall  explain  the  reasons  for  the  said"
"conclusion in the following paragraphs."
"The evidence of the prosecution, which the trial Court has found to"
"be credible and reliable, indicate that no sooner the deceased came near the"
