"S.C. Appeal No.168/2018"
"two  views.  In  fact,  as-it  appears  to  me,  just  as  inevitably  as  one"
"cannot  have  one  side  of  a  sheet  of  paper  without  the  other,  there"
"cannot be one view of a matter and not the contrary view as well. If,"
"for instance, an accused rests his defence upon exception 1 of section"
"294  of  the  Penal  Code,  the  Jury  may  decide  that  he  has  proved,"
"within the meaning of proof in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance,"
"the circumstances alleged by him and yet may hold or not hold that"
"he lost his self-control in consequence of the provocation to which he"
"was subjected. Similarly, when circumstances are in evidence which"
"the  Jury  regard  as  having  been  proved,  they  may  or  may  not  hold"
"that  those  circumstances  established  that  there  was  a  sudden  fight,"
"upon  a  sudden  quarrel,  and  that  the  accused  ""  did  not  take  undue"
"advantage,  &c."".  It  is  only  if  they  are  in  doubt  as  to  whether  they"
"should or should not hold that circumstances existed which brought"
"the case within exception 4 of section 294 of the Penal Code, that the"
"existence of such circumstances cannot be said to have been proved."
"Even if two views are possible, they may have no doubt as to which"
"of these views they prefer to take on the basis of probability.‚Äù"
