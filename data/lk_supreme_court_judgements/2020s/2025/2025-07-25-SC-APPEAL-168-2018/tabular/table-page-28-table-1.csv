"S.C. Appeal No.168/2018"
"claim made by the 4th accused that the deceased has stabbed him “after the"
"incident” could clearly be equated to a near impossibility."
"If one were to consider the position that the alleged act of stabbing"
"of  the  4th  accused  has  taken  place  prior  to  the  incident  by  which  the"
"deceased  has 
suffered 
fatal 
injuries,  which 
the  only  eyewitness  has"
"consistently denied of, it is reasonable to expect that the knife used in the"
"stabbing should have been lying at the scene after the act of stabbing. The"
"deceased was rushed to hospital soon after the  incident. All  four accused"
"fled the scene immediately afterwards and surrendered to authorities at a"
"later point of time. The eyewitness and the wife of the deceased proceeded"
"to the police to make complaints. Neither the prosecution nor the accused"
"thought it fit to clarify from the investigator that whether it was revealed"
"during investigations that there was a knife, which may have used in the"
"incident, or  whether  such  a  weapon  was  lying  among the  small  pieces  of"
"club, or whether any other person removed the same from the scene."
"Thus, in effect there was no ‘evidence’ placed before the trial Court"
"to 
indicate 
that  the  4th  accused  sustained  any  stab 
injury  during 
the"
"‘incident’  he  speaks  of.  The  ‘evidence’  referred  by  the  4th  accused,  points"
"only to the fact that he made such a claim to the Magistrate’s Court, at the"
"time  of  surrendering  to 
it  through  his 
legal  Counsel. 
  Therefore, 
the"
"assertions of the 4th accused taking up the positions that the injuries he has"
"sustained are stab injuries, a knife was used in that attack, and it was the"
"deceased  who  inflicted  these  injuries,  were  presented  for  the  first  time"
"before the High Court, and that too after eight years since the incident by"
"which the deceased suffered his injuries."
