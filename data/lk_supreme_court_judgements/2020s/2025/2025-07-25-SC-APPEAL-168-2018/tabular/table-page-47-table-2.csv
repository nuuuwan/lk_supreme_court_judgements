"In this particular context, the pronouncement made by Howard CJ in"
"The  King  v  James  Chandrasekera  (supra  and  at  p.115)  becomes  very"
"relevant.  His  Lordship  stated  that  “  [I]t  may  be  conceded  that  one  of  the"
"reasons  why  the  final  words  of  section  105,  namely,  ‘  …  and  the  Court  shall"
"presume the absence of such circumstances’ , may have been inserted was so as to"
"make it clear that the non-existence of such circumstances was not a matter to be"
"established  by  the  prosecution  as  under  the  old  law.  On  the  other  hand,  the  fact"
"that such words have been inserted seems to manifest only too clearly the burden"
"cast on the accused.”"
