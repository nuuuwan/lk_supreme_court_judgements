"(1935)  A.  C.  462,  pronounced  on  23rd  May  1935,  Viscount  Sanky  L.C."
"famously stated (at p. 481):"
"“[T]hroughout the web of English Criminal  Law one golden thread"
"is  always  to  be  seen,  that  is  the  prosecution  to  prove  the  prisoner’s"
"guilt  …  If,  at  the  end  and  whole  of  the  case,  there  is  a  reasonable"
"doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the"
"prisoner,  as  to  whether  the  prisoner  killed  the  deceased  with  a"
"malicious  intention,  the  prosecution  has  not  made  out  the  case  and"
"the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge, or"
"where  the  trial,  the  principle  that  the  prosecution  must  prove  the"
"guilt of the prisoner is part of the Common Law of England and no"
"attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.”"
