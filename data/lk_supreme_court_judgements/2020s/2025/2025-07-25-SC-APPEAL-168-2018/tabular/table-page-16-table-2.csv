"It  is  clear  from  these  multiple  suggestions  that  were  put  to  the"
"prosecution witness, that they indicate the alternative factual positions the"
"4th  accused 
intends  to  rely  on  by  providing  his  own  narrative  of  the"
"incident.  These

"instigated  the  incident  by  walking  up  to  the  group  of  men,  and  after"
"creating  “this  incident”  had  repeatedly  stabbed  the  4th  accused.  The  4th"
"accused’s  position,  as 
these  suggestions  reveal,  he  had  picked  up  a"
"wooden  pole  from  a  nearby  fence  and  used  it  to  hit the  deceased  only at"
"that  critical  moment.  He  further  claims  that  he  struck  a  blow  on  the"
"deceased and, that too only once, in order to protect his own life. He also"

"around at that point of time, to prevent the deceased from attacking the 4th"
"accused,  but  the  deceased  had  repeatedly  stabbed  the  4th  accused,  which"
"made him bled from those injuries."
