"S.C. Appeal No.168/2018"
"the  four  accused  in  terms  of  the  Exception  4,  although  the  assault  on  him"
"seemed  a  sudden  one.  Of  course,  the  prosecution  did  not  present  any"
"evidence  pointing  in  the  direction  that  the  attack  on  the  deceased  is  a"
"premeditated one where the four accused have planned out the details or"
"have acted in prior concert. No one could have predicted that the deceased"
"to  come  out  of  his  house  and  walk  up  to  the  group  of  men,  who  were"
"standing on the other side of the road. The stomach contents of 500 grams"
"of  rice,  noted  by  the  consultant  JMO,  indicate  that  the  deceased  was  just"
"after  his  lunch  and,  as  the  eye  witness  opined  during  cross  examination,"
"that he may have walked up to the accused perhaps to mediate the dispute"
"or to pacify the obviously agitated men."
