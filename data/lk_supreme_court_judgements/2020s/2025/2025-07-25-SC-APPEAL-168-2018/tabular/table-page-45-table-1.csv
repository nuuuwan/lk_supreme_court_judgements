"S.C. Appeal No.168/2018"
"circumstances is left in doubt by him, that is to say is not proved by"
"him, for  section 3  says  that  ‘a  fact  is  not  proved  when  it  is  neither"
"proved nor disproved’. Such a conclusion appears to me to refute the"
"argument."
"The position is however different in cases in which, by involving the"
"fact  in  issue  in  sufficient  doubt  the  accused  ipso  facto  involves  in"
"such  doubt  an  element  of  the  offence  that  the  prosecution  had  to"
"prove.  That,  for  instance,  would  have  been  the  position  under  our"
"law in the Woolmington case, if on the charge of murder, or all the"
"matters before them, the Jury were in sufficient doubt as to whether"
"the death of the deceased girl was the result of an accident or not, for,"
"in  that  state  of  doubt,  the  Jury  are  necessarily  as  much  in  doubt"
"whether the intention to cause death or to cause an injury sufficient"
"in  the  ordinary  cause  of  nature  to  cause  death,  existed  or  not.  In"
"such a case, the proper view seems to me to be that.”"
