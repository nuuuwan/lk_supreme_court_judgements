"S.C. Appeal No.168/2018"
"pragmatism  into  the  task  of    providing  a  meaning  to  a  particular  word"
"used  in  a  Section,  as  it  endeavour  to  do  so  without  imposing  any  undue"
"restrictions  to  the  scope  of  the  statutory  provisions  contained 
in  that"
"Section, 
in  order 
to  cover  a  wider  spectrum  of  situations,  which 
the"
"Legislature  would  have  envisaged  to  cater  in  the  first  place  by  enacting"
"that  Section,  as 
indicative  from 
its  act  of  making  an 
insertion  of  that"
"particular  word 
into 
the 
text  of 
the  statute,  but  refrained 
itself  from"
"providing a specific meaning to that particular word. In forming that view,"
"I derive support from a statement of Bindra on Interpretation of Statutes (9th"
"Ed,  at  p.  59)  “[W]hen  an  expression  is  not  defined  in  the  statute  and  such"
"expression  happens  to  be  one  of  everyday  use,  it  must  be  construed  in  popular"
"sense, as understood in common parlance, and not in any technical sense.”"
