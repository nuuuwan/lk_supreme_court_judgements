the  prosecution  witness,","the  4th"
"accused had effectively denied any involvement of him in causing injuries",""
"to the  deceased  in  the  exercise  of  his  right to private  defence  because  the",""
"deceased tried to stab him. The specific suggestion put to the witness and",""
"the  evidence  of  the  4th  accused  on  that  particular  point  runs  contrary  to",""
"each other. Therefore, the factual positions placed before the trial Court by",""
"the  4th  accused  in  support of  a  sudden  fight is  not  at all  a  consistent one.",""
"No item of evidence, other than the suggestion on stabbing, that had been",""
"placed before the trial Court, by consideration of which it could arrive at a",""
"conclusion  that  a  sudden  fight  has  probably  taken  place  between  the",""
"deceased and the 4th accused. In my view, the effect of the said suggestion,",""
"namely that he was stabbed by the deceased and that he ran away from the",""
"scene to save himself from receiving any injury, clearly disqualified him to",""
"the benefit of Exception 4. When the prosecution alleged that it was, he who",""
"inflicted  the  fatal  blow,  the  4th  accused,  by  making  a  counter  factual",""
"allegation that he was the victim of the attack, makes no impact on any of",""
"the requirements that he ought to establish on the applicability of Exception",""
"4.  If  the  4th  accused  were  to  receive  any  benefit  from  that  exception,  he",""
"needed  to  accept  that  it  was  he  who  inflicted  the  fatal  blow,  but  he  only",""
"did  so  during  a  sudden  fight  and  “in  the  heat  of  passion”  in  inflicting  that",""
"injury. The 4th accused cannot derive any benefit by denying the attack on",""
"the  deceased  and  making  a  counter  claim  of  being  attacked  by","the"
"deceased. It also appears from making the said suggestion, the 4th accused",""
"had  relied  on  the  exercise  of  his right of  private  defence  rather  than  on  a",""
"sudden fight, in an attempt in diminishing culpability.",""
