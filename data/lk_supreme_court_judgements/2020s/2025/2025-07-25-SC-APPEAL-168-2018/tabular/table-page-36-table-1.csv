"the  deceased  and  his  assailants  and 
thereby  offers  no  assistance 
to"
"determine the issues presented for determination in the instant appeal."
"However, in Ghapoo Yadave and Others v State of Orissa AIR 2003"
"SC  1620,  a 
judgment  relied  upon  by 
the 
learned  Counsel  for  the  4th"
"accused, the apex Court India has stated that “[A] fight suddenly takes place,"
"for  which  both  parties  are  more  or  less  to  be  blamed.  It  may  be  that  one  of  them"
"starts  it,  but  if the  other  had  not  aggravated  it  by  his  own  conduct  it  would  not"
"have 
taken 
the  serious 
turn 
it  did.  There 
is 
then  mutual  provocation  and"
"aggravation,  and  it  is  difficult  to  apportion  the  share  of  blame  which  attaches  to"
"each fighter.”"
"It  is  in  the  light  of  these  principles  I  now  proceed  to  consider  the"
"contention  of  the  4th  accused  that  he  was  denied  the  concession  of  lessor"
"culpability in terms of Exception 4."
"Amali speaks of two incidents. First, she speaks of the incident over"
"the  demand  of  fish  made  by  the  four  accused.  Second,  she  speaks  of  an"
"incident  by  which  the  deceased  has  suffered  several  fatal  injuries  on  his"
"head. It is clear from the evidence of the prosecution that the first incident"
"ended without any form of violence, although the accused have indicated"
"their 
strong  displeasure  of  Amali’s  husband’s 
intervention 
into 
their"
"interaction  with  the  particular  fish  dealer,  by  throwing  the  key  on  the"
"ground and uttering what seemed a veiled threat."
"The deceased has never featured any time during the entirety of the"
"first incident, although he lived adjacent to the open space, where the lorry"
"was  parked  at.  It  is  highly  probable  that  the  deceased  was  privy  to  the"
"circumstances  which  has 
taken  place  during 
the 
first 
incident.  That"
