ARGUED ON : 06th June, 2023 DECIDED ON : 25th July, 2025 ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Attorney General presented an indictment to the High Court

holden at Matara, alleging that the four accused named therein have

committed the murder of one Punam Chiristombuge Chandralal on or about

05.07.2007 at Polathumodara. The accused appellant- appellant in the instant

appeal was the 4th accused named in the said indictment and shall

accordingly be referred to hereinafter in this judgment as the 4th accused.

The trial of the four accused, upon their own selection proceeded without

a jury. At its conclusion, the High Court found the 1st and 4th accused

guilty for the offence of murder, while entering verdicts of acquittals in

respect of the 2nd and 3rd accused. The reason for the trial Courts decision

to acquit the 2nd and 3rd accused was that it entertained reasonable doubt

whether these two accused have shared the common murderous intention

with which the 1st and 4th accused acted on. The trial Court concluded that

the 1st and 4th accused committed the murder, when they attacked the

deceased with that intention.

The 1st and 4th accused have preferred appeals to the Court of

Appeal (CA 71-72/2016), against their conviction for murder and the

consequential imposition of death sentence. The Court of Appeal, in

delivering its judgment, now being impugned by these proceedings, had

partly allowed the appeal of the 1st accused. The Court of Appeal set aside

the conviction for murder and substituted same with a conviction for

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

4

culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The appellate Court has

thereupon proceeded to impose a ten-year term of imprisonment on the 1st

accused for his complicity in the death of the deceased.

The appeal of the 4th accused however was dismissed after affirming

the conviction for murder entered against him. On 29.07.2020, the

judgment of the Court of Appeal was corrected with the insertion of [T]he

4th Accused-Appellants conviction under [Section] 296 is affirmed.

The 4th accused thereupon moved this Court, seeking special leave

to appeal against the said judgment and invited this Court to have it set

aside. This Court, by its order dated 26.10.2018, granted special leave to

appeal on the following questions of law:

a. has the Court of Appeal erred in failing to evaluate the evidence

in the case in its totality and the failure to appreciate the same

and on an impartial and objective evaluation of the evidence,

there was clearly, at the very least, a reasonable doubt as to the

guilt of the 4th accused ?

b. has the Court of Appeal erred in law by affirming the conviction

of the 4th accused for murder while convicting the 1st accused for

culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of a

sudden fight?

c. has the Court of Appeal failed to consider that the 4th accused

also can be convicted for culpable homicide not amounting to

murder on the basis of a sudden fight as facts and circumstances

of the case is similar to the 1st accused?

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

5

d. has the Court of Appeal failed to consider that the facts and the

circumstances of the case show that attack was not premeditated

one nor was there a prior concert?

During the hearing of the instant appeal, learned Counsel for the 4th

accused strongly urged before this Court that the evidence presented by

the prosecution in itself indicative of a sudden fight, that had erupted

between the deceased and the four accused, but the Courts below have

fallen into a common but a serious error, in failing to consider that vital

factor in favour of his client. He further submitted that if those Courts did

consider the relevant evidence in its proper perspective, the 4th accused

should have been afforded with the benefit of sudden fight, as it would

clearly have satisfied the requisites of Exception 4 of Section 294 of the

Penal Code, which makes him guilty not to the offence of murder but to

the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

In order to make an assessment of the extent to which the adverse

impact created by the said error attributed to the appellate Court by the

learned Counsel on the question of applicable criminal liability of the 4th

accused, it is imperative that this Court considers the several questions of

law in light of the body of evidence that had been presented before the

trial Court by the prosecution, the factual positions that were suggested by

the 4th accused during his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses

along with his evidence presented to trial Court, in the form of a statement

made from the dock and to have them tested against the applicable

principles of law.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

The only eyewitness to the incident, Shanika Amali is the sister-in-

law of the deceased. Her husband and his brother (the deceased) were

engaged in the fish trade. They used to buy stocks of fish from

businessmen, who brought their stocks of fish collected from fishermen in

Kalpitiya, Mannar and Uda Walave areas. These trade transactions were

conducted in an open area that lies adjacent to the deceaseds house, which

the witness described as ud fmd,.

Describing the incident during which the deceased lost his life,

Amali said in her evidence that, in the afternoon of the day of the incident,

one such businessmen, who delivered a stock of fish that morning, came to

meet her husband, in order to collect his dues. He complained to her

husband that a group of drunkards have demanded fish from him. The

businessman was loading his empty crates back into his vehicle, when this

demand was made. Upon being told that he had no fish to offer, one of the

drunkards, had forcibly taken the ignition key of the vehicle.

Upon hearing the complaint, Amalis husband went out to enquire

what was happening and found the four accused have gathered near the

lorry parked in ud fmd,. The 1st and 2nd accused, who are siblings and

were living in a house situated on the other side of the ud fmd,. The 3rd

accused is a resident of Mirissa area while the 4th accused is from the

adjoining village. The witness, who knew all four of them prior to the

incident identified all of them. She then added that, all four were singing

while consuming alcohol since morning of that day.

Amalis husband requested them to return the key to its owner. One

of the four accused threw away the key to the ground. They questioned

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

7

Amalis husband whether he too is a thug (WU;a pkafhlao). Thereupon, the

group proceeded in the direction of the 1st accuseds house and the

witnesss husband walked back towards his house. The witness and her

husband however, were standing on the road in front of their house.

The deceased, who apparently heard the shouting at ud fmd,, came

out of his house only at that point. Having crossed over the main road, the

deceased had walked in the direction of the 1st accuseds house. The four

accused, who by then were gathered in front of the 1st accuseds house,

had surrounded the deceased who walked up to them. There was no

exchange of words between any of them. In a flash, all of them have

attacked the deceased with their fists. While the attack on the deceased

was continuing, the 1st accused suddenly ran into his house and brought

back a rice pounder.

The 4th accused, without making any utterance, had snatched the

rice pounder from the 1st accused and hit the deceased on the crown of his

head twice. The deceased, after receiving blows on his head, collapsed on

the ground. The 4th accused thereafter ran away carrying the rice pounder

along with him. The other three accused too had dispersed after the

deceased has fallen down.

The deceased was bleeding from his head injuries and could not

speak. He only made a gargling sound. He was immediately rushed to

hospital where he was pronounced dead on admission. It was the witness

who provided the first information of the incident to the police, after

accompanying the deceaseds wife there. The witness has implicated all

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

8

four accused as the persons who are responsible for causing the death of

the deceased.

Chief Inspector Ranjith of Weligama police station investigated into

this incident. Upon visiting the scene, he observed a clotted blood patch,

which spread over an area of three feet, and several small blood patches

scattered on the Galle-Matara main road. He also noted several small

fragments of wood ( l=vd len,s), which he presumed to have broken off

from a stick. This was observed in front of the house in which the 1st and

2nd accused lived and also of the deceaseds own house on the opposite

side. He did not search for the rice pounder, since his investigations

revealed that the accused had taken it along with him when he fled the

scene. None of the accused were arrested by the police. They evaded

arrest after fleeing from the area. The 1st and 2nd accused have surrendered

to police after four days since the incident i.e., on 09.07.2007, whereas the

3rd and 4th accused have surrendered directly to Court, through their

Attorney-at-Law.

The above, being a brief examination of the narrative presented by

the prosecution before the High Court, however does not lend any support

to the 4th accuseds claim that the deceased had attempted to stab him or

any of the other accused. It is of relevance to note that it does not support

even an inference that the deceased had at least started a verbal altercation

with the 4th accused or any of the other three accused, over their demand

of fish.

The High Court, after having considered the evidence presented

before it by the parties, decided to reject the evidence of the 4th accused

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

9

and proceeded to hold that the charge of murder against him was

established beyond reasonable doubt. The trial Court particularly

considered the contention advanced by the 4th accused, before this Court

as well as the trial Court, that he was stabbed by the deceased. The trial

Court was of the view that if the 4th accused had suffered any serious stab

injury as he claims, there was no reason for that fact not to be revealed

during the investigations. The impartiality of the officers who investigated

the incident was never questioned or challenged by any of the accused.

In challenging the validity of his conviction for murder, the 4th

accused complained to the Court of Appeal in the petition of appeal, the

High Court failed to consider the prosecution evidence that the deceased

and the accused were engaged in a sudden fight and it failed to afford the

benefit of being convicted for the lessor offence of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder on account of that evidence.

The Court of Appeal accepted the contention presented by the 1st

accused before that Court of not sharing a common murderous intention

with the others. It then proceeded to alter his conviction by setting aside

the conviction for murder and substituting same with a conviction for

lessor offence. The Court of Appeal however decided to affirm the

conviction of the 4th accused to the offence of murder entered by the High

Court on the premise that there was no evidence of sudden fight during

which any of the accused sustained any injury and it was the 4th accused,

who dealt the fatal blow on the head of the deceased.

In order to test the legal validity of the conclusions reached by that

Court to impose criminal liability on the 4th accused for the offence of

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

10

murder, and to test the validity of the impugned decision of the Court of

Appeal in affirming that conviction, it is necessary for this Court to

consider the respective lines of reasoning adopted by the trial Court as

well as the appellate Court, and to test them in the light of applicable

principles of law relating to sudden fight.

With that intention in mind, I shall first refer to the relevant

principles of law.

Section 294 of the Penal Code, whilst defining the offence of murder,

also states that except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is

murder and lists out five such exceptions in that Section. Exception 4 of

Section 294, application of which is the primary issue in the instant appeal,

reads thus; [C]ulpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and

the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual

manner. The Explanation that follows the said exception also reads that

[I]t is immaterial, in such cases, which party offers the provocation or commits the

first assault.

This Court, in the course of its judgment in Bandara v The Attorney

General (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 55, reproduced a section from the text of Law of

Crimes, by Ratanlal and Dhirajlal (24th Edition, 1998, page 1339), which

describes the requisites to be established before Court in relation to Indian

Penal Code, in order to derive the benefit of Exception 4. Section 300 and its

Exceptions of Indian Penal Code are identical to that of Section 294 of our

Penal Code.

The several requisites that are listed therein are as follows:

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

11

1. it was a sudden fight

2. there was no premeditation

3. the act was committed in a heat of passion and

4. the assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a

cruel manner.

Since the contention presented by the 4th accused is premised on the

failure of the lower Courts to impute lessor culpability on him, in terms of

exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code, I intend to make a brief

reference to the law applicable as to the question on whom the burden of

bringing a case into the said exception lies.

In the judgment of Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions

(1935) A. C. 462, pronounced on 23rd May 1935, Viscount Sanky L.C.

famously stated (at p. 481):

[T]hroughout the web of English Criminal Law one golden thread

is always to be seen, that is the prosecution to prove the prisoners

guilt If, at the end and whole of the case, there is a reasonable

doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the

prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a

malicious intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and

the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge, or

where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the

guilt of the prisoner is part of the Common Law of England and no

attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

12

After a lapse of about seven years since the pronouncement of the

said judgment in England, in the case of The King v James Chandrasekera

(1942) 44 NLR 97, a divisional bench of the Court of Criminal Appeal

consisting of seven Judges, was called upon to determine the question, in a

case in which any general or special exception in the Penal Code is pleaded

by an accused person and the evidence relied on by such accused fails to

satisfy the Jury affirmatively of the existence of circumstances bringing the

case within the exception so pleaded, whether that accused is entitled to be

acquitted if, upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, a reasonable

doubt is created in the minds of the Jury as to whether he is entitled to the

benefit of the exception so pleaded, particularly in view of the

pronouncements already made in Woolmington v Director of Public

Prosecutions (supra) and, having regard to Section 105 of the Evidence

Ordinance and also to the definition of proved in Section 3 thereof.

Howard CJ, with the concurrence of the majority of Justices (De

Kretser J dissented), held (at p. 117) that the Jury shall regard the fact as

proved that the accused did not exercise the right of private defence till it is

satisfied that he did so or that it is so probable that he did so that a prudent man

should act on that supposition. This Court, in the course of its judgment of

Bandara v The Attorney General (supra), has re-emphasised that it is for

an accused, who wishes to avail himself of the benefit of the imposition of

lessor culpability on the basis of sudden fight in terms of Exception 4, to

satisfy Court of the several requisites to bring in his case into that

exception. Hence, in relation to the appeal before this Court, it is the 4th

accused who is expected to establish that there was a sudden fight in terms

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

13

of Exception 4 of Section 294 on a balance of probability, if he were to

receive the expected benefit of the imposition of lessor culpability.

The question whether the 4th appellant has sufficiently discharged

his evidentiary burden before the trial Court in respect of all of these

requisites must be answered only upon a consideration of the evidence

presented before that Court.

The narrative of the prosecution witnesses, particularly of the only

eye witness to the incident clearly does not favour a finding that there was

a sudden fight in terms of Exception 4. The evidence of the 4th accused,

presented in the form of a statement from the dock also failed to provide

such evidence. This is because the 4th accused has stated in his statement

from the dock that f idlaIsldrsh lshkafka fndre isoah yrshg thd oelafla

keye f isoafhka miqj ug ,d,a msys myrj,a ;=klau wekakd ug ffrkak nersu

;ek uu u jegqkd Bg uu ke.sg,d osjd ug lshkak ;sfnkafka tmukhs.(Sic) The

4th accused, therefore did not admit that he dealt the fatal blows on the

deceased and that too was during a sudden fight. Instead, he speaks of a

situation where the deceased had stabbed him after this incident (f

isoafhka miqj).

In view of the factual assertions contained in the dock statement, it is

reasonable to assume that when the 4th accused said this incident, he was

in fact referring to the incident in which the deceased has suffered his fatal

injuries. The 4th accused, by stating that the alleged act of stabbing by the

deceased has happened after this incident, is clearly indicative of the fact

that, the act of stabbing has happened at a subsequent stage to the attack

on the deceased. Therefore, in effect, the 4th accused made no attempt

during his evidence to bring his case within time frame of the attack on the

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

14

deceased as the Exception 4 speaks of in a sudden fight in the heat of

passion upon a sudden quarrel indicative of a specific time frame within

which he had caused the death, although he now seeks to claim its benefit

by placing reliance on the evidence of the prosecution.

In such a situation, the function of the trial Court was examined by

the Court of Criminal Appeal in Luvis v The Queen (1954) 56 NLR 442. In

view of several judicial precedents on the point, it was held by that Court (

at p. 444):

although it was an integral part of the appellant's defence at the

trial that the deceased came by his death in the course of a sudden

fight, it was not specifically raised as a defence that the appellant

was the person who inflicted the fatal injury in the course of that

fight, but having regard to the evidence we were satisfied that the

fact that such a defence was not specifically raised did not relieve the

learned trial Judge of the duty of placing before the Jury that aspect

of the case.

This underlying principle recognised by a series of judicial

precedents places a duty on the Courts to consider the entirety of the

evidence in which there may be some that might have a bearing on the

issue of sudden fight. Accordingly, the evidence of the only eye witness as

well as the evidence of other prosecution witnesses will have to be

examined at this juncture in a more descriptive manner. This is

necessitated in view of the contention advanced by the learned Counsel on

behalf of the 4th accused.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

15

Since the statement made by the 4th accused failed to provide any

material to justify a conclusion that the deceased sustained his fatal

injuries during a sudden fight, the evidence placed before the trial Court

should be scrutinised in its entirety to determine whether he should be

given the benefit of Exception 4. In this regard, and in the absence of the

evidence of the eyewitness to support such a position, it is important to

consider the nature of the suggestions that were put to her by the 4th

accused, during his cross- examination of her. The suggestions that were

put to the witness that have a bearing on the question of sudden fight shall

be considered in this regard.

It is already noted earlier on that the prosecutions narrative does

not support a factual position there was a sudden fight between the

deceased and the 4th accused. In fact, the eyewitness has effectively denied

of such an incident. In this regard, it is therefore very relevant to consider

the positions suggested by the 4th accused during his cross-examination to

the eyewitness Amali. In order to retain the originality of the exact

positions that were suggested to her during cross-examination, I have

reproduced below the most relevant sections from the proceedings

conducted before the trial Court (at page 121 of the appeal brief):

iajdks

It is clear from these multiple suggestions that were put to the

prosecution witness, that they indicate the alternative factual positions the

4th accused intends to rely on by providing his own narrative of the

incident. These suggestions include that it was the deceased who

instigated the incident by walking up to the group of men, and after

creating this incident had repeatedly stabbed the 4th accused. The 4th

accuseds position, as these suggestions reveal, he had picked up a

wooden pole from a nearby fence and used it to hit the deceased only at

that critical moment. He further claims that he struck a blow on the

deceased and, that too only once, in order to protect his own life. He also

suggested that there were efforts made by the others, who have gathered

around at that point of time, to prevent the deceased from attacking the 4th

accused, but the deceased had repeatedly stabbed the 4th accused, which

made him bled from those injuries.

It is evident from these suggestions as to the nature of the factual

position that the 4th accused had intended to present before Court in his

evidence in order to establish a sudden fight. The suggestions made to the

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

17

prosecution witness will remain mere suggestions if the witness denies

them. In such circumstances, the fact that such suggestions that were made

during cross examination would only assist the accused to show the

consistency of his version of events presented through his evidence.

However, if a prosecution witness makes an admission of a particular

position suggested to him by an accused, that admission becomes

evidence, in support of that accused. But in this instance, as her answers

would reveal, that the prosecution witness maintained a consistent

position of denial of not only a sudden fight, but a fight at all between the

two of them. She asserted that it was the four accused who launched a

surprise attack on the unarmed deceased, when he walked towards them.

In addition, there was an emphatic denial by the witness of an act of

stabbing on the part of the deceased.

This is evident from the examination of the answers given by the

eyewitness during her cross-examination, when she was questioned over

the very commencement of the incident. The witness stated thus (at p. 143

of the appeal brief):

W mdr mek, t;kg ,d,a whshd ta fodrlvg ta me;a;g tkj

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

18

Continuing cross-examination on these lines and when the witness

was further suggested that it was the deceased who stabbed the 4th

accused, her clear and unambiguous answer is as follows (at p. 144 of the

appeal brief):

m% fudlo ;uqka fyd|dldrju okakjd f kvqf isoah wdrN

W keye iajdks uu gqf keye

Thus, as indicative from the evidence referred to in the preceding

paragraphs and the reproduction of the segments of cross-examination, it

is clear that the narrative presented by the prosecution does not speak of a

sudden fight between the deceased and the 4th accused.

The suggestion that uy;=kag msysfhka wekSug W;aidy lsrSu ksid thska

oSu i|yd wi, ;sp ta wdikakfha ;spsp jegl ;sp fmd lE,a,la wr f.k

;ukaf.a cS; wdrlaIdj i|yd myrla .eyqjd was denied by the eyewitness and

thus remains a mere suggestion until and unless the 4th accused presents

evidence in support of that factual position. Instead, the 4th accused stated

in his statement from the dock that f isoafhka miqj ug ,d,a msys myrj,a

;=klau wekakd ug ffrkak nersu ;ek uu u jegqkd Bg uu ke.sg,d osjd.(Sic)

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

19

With these suggestions put to the prosecution witness, the 4th

accused had effectively denied any involvement of him in causing injuries

to the deceased in the exercise of his right to private defence because the

deceased tried to stab him. The specific suggestion put to the witness and

the evidence of the 4th accused on that particular point runs contrary to

each other. Therefore, the factual positions placed before the trial Court by

the 4th accused in support of a sudden fight is not at all a consistent one.

No item of evidence, other than the suggestion on stabbing, that had been

placed before the trial Court, by consideration of which it could arrive at a

conclusion that a sudden fight has probably taken place between the

deceased and the 4th accused. In my view, the effect of the said suggestion,

namely that he was stabbed by the deceased and that he ran away from the

scene to save himself from receiving any injury, clearly disqualified him to

the benefit of Exception 4. When the prosecution alleged that it was, he who

inflicted the fatal blow, the 4th accused, by making a counter factual

allegation that he was the victim of the attack, makes no impact on any of

the requirements that he ought to establish on the applicability of Exception

4. If the 4th accused were to receive any benefit from that exception, he

needed to accept that it was he who inflicted the fatal blow, but he only

did so during a sudden fight and in the heat of passion in inflicting that

injury. The 4th accused cannot derive any benefit by denying the attack on

the deceased and making a counter claim of being attacked by the

deceased. It also appears from making the said suggestion, the 4th accused

had relied on the exercise of his right of private defence rather than on a

sudden fight, in an attempt in diminishing culpability.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

20

During cross-examination of the solitary eyewitness by the 3rd and

4th accused, she emphatically denied the suggestion of an altercation that

erupted between the deceased and the accused. If at all, it could have been

probable if the 4th accused has taken up the position that an altercation had

occurred between the witnesss husband and the four accused over the

issue of demanding fish and it was only when the deceased tried to

intervene in support of his brother, he suffered the fatal injuries. Even to

infer that there may have been such a situation, the eyewitness has clearly

stated that there was no exchange of words between her husband and the

accused despite the demand of fish and the act of forcibly taking the key to

the lorry. That brief interaction has ended with issuance of a terse

statement WU;a pkafhlao, which came from the accused. With that the

parties had dispersed.

It was only after that incident that the deceased had emerged out of

his house and walked across the road and came up to the place where the

four accused stood. According to eye witness testimony, no sooner the

deceased came near the group of accused, the attack has begun without

any form of a warning. There were no words that were exchanged

between the deceased or any of the four accused. It is during this session of

cross-examination; the eyewitness used the word that the 4th accused has

snatched the rice pounder from the 1st accused and used same to hit the

deceased on his head. She repeatedly denied the suggestions that the 4th

accused has sustained three stab injuries during this incident and was

specific that nothing of that sort has ever happened. She further

specifically denied that the 4th accused had any bleeding injuries on him.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

21

The witness candidly admitted that the father of the 1st accused too

came to the place of attack in order to make a failed attempt to intervene.

The witness however denied that the others who gathered around have

tried to prevent the deceased from stabbing the 4th accused. Thereupon,

the 4th accused suggested to Amali that the deceased, after disregarding the

intervention by an elderly person, has made an attempt to stab him and, in

order to protect himself from stabbing, he has picked up a wooden fence

post from a nearby fence and hit the deceased once with it. The 4th accused

suggested that, in doing so, he exercised his right of private defence. The

reply of the witness to the said suggestion, which was founded on the

premise that there was a sudden fight, was to deny the same. She further

added that nothing of that sort ever happened.

During the cross-examination by the 1st and 2nd accused, the witness

admitted that no sooner the attack on the deceased has commenced,

someone shouted .ykfj`, prompting her to run towards the place of the

incident. Referring to the first incident involving the demand of fish, the

witness has added on to her narrative by stating that when the driver of

the lorry complained that the key is kept until the demand made by the

accused for fish is met, her husband made an attempt to explain to the

accused that there are only empty crates loaded in the vehicle. When

suggested that the said incident has ended without any violence, she

readily agreed.

When the 1st and 2nd accused suggested that the 2nd incident started

only when the deceased has crossed over to the other side with a knife in

hand, Amali strongly denied same and stated she has not seen the deceased

carrying any weapon. The 1st and 2nd accused too have suggested to the

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

22

witness that it was the deceased who came up to the accused with a knife

in his hand. They also suggested that only then a fight between the 4th

accused and the deceased broke out. Amali consistently denied all these

suggestions, as she has already denied them when suggested for the 3rd

and 4th accused.

There were no contradictions or omissions marked off the testimony

of the eyewitness during the trial to the effect that either she has stated

elsewhere that the 4th accused has sustained injuries during the incident.

Nor did any of the accused elicited through cross-examination that she has

stated that the deceased has attacked the 4th accused with a knife. In the

context of a sudden fight, the fact that no contradictions or omissions on

this vital aspect of the case for the 4th accused assumes greater significance.

This is because the absence of a contradiction or an omission in this

particular aspect of the narrative of the witness indicates that she was

consistent with her stance taken before the trial Court.

What remains to be considered in this regard is the evidence elicited

through the investigating officer, in relation to his observation of broken

pieces of a wooden stick at the crime scene, and his admission that there

was evidence of a fight and the claim made by the 4th accused to the

Magistrate that he was stabbed.

In addition to the positions taken up by the 4th accused in his

statement from the dock, suggesting that he exercised of his right of

private defence upon being stabbed by the deceased, he also relied on

these three items of evidence, in an attempt to establish the said four

requisites of a sudden fight. Of these three, two items of evidence were

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

23

elicited through the investigating officer, who visited the crime scene and

made his observations. Upon being cross-examined by the 4th accused, CI

Ranjith stated that he observed several small pieces of wood, which he

termed as broken pieces of a pole or a stick, were seen scattered near the

area of blood patches ( hlsis fmd,a,l le .sh fmd fldgia mdf ;ek ;ek

je, lsnqkd). During cross- examination by the 1st and 2nd accused, the

witness clarified that he did not take these pieces of wood into his charge

as items of production due to the fact that his investigations revealed that

the attacker used only a rice pounder to attack the deceased and walked

away with it.

The observation of the police officer of a broken pieces of a pole or a

stick at the crime scene adds nothing to the question of a sudden fight, in

the absence of any evidence explaining its relevance to the case. The

prosecution version makes no reference to such a pole or a stick, other than

the rice pounder used by the 4th accused of hitting the deceased on his

head.

The only reference made to a piece of a club in the proceedings

before the trial Court could be found in the suggestion made by the 4th

accused. It was suggested to the witness that the 4th accused, upon being

stabbed by the deceased, had picked up a piece of wood from a fence ( fmd

lE,a,) and used it on the deceased, in the exercise of his right of private defence.

However, in his statement made from the dock, the 4th accused made no

reference to such an act on his part and thereby effectively restricted his

activity to fleeing from the scene for his safety, when the deceased stabbed

him thrice and that too after the incident.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

24

Furthermore, the investigating officer was satisfied that these pieces

of wood have no relevance to the investigation he conducted as it was

revealed that the only weapon used in the incident was a rice pounder.

The 4th accused also does not state in his evidence that the pieces of wood

found at the crime scene were probably from the fmd lE,a, which he

used to attack the deceased. In the absence of any evidence which brings

in the said observation of the investigator as a fact in issue, in terms of the

Evidence Ordinance, that item remains to be a mere item of evidence,

devoid of any relevance to the trial against the 4th accused.

It is at this stage, learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd accused

questioned the witness whether he observed the crime scene as a place

where a fight has taken place. The witness answered this question in the

affirmative. The question put to the witness by the Counsel for the accused

was mqoa.,fhd lSm fofkla iska fl`,y,hla we;slr .ekSfoS we;sjk ,l=Kq

lrk t ia:dkfha ;snqko@. It is in the process of answering this question, the

witness said yes. Importantly, during the same cross-examination, the

witness also stated that his investigation revealed that only one person

sustained injuries in the attack.

Learned Counsel for the 4th accused did not examine the witness any

further on this important and vital aspect of his defence. The prosecutor, in

his re-examination of the witness, clarified that the statements of two of

the accused were recorded by an officer, after visiting them in the prisons,

who made no mention of the fact that there were injuries noted on any of

them. The 4th accused is one of the two whose statement was recorded

whilst being in remand custody.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

25

The third item of evidence relied on by the 4th accused was, the fact

that he too was injured that was borne out by the proceedings before the

Magistrates Court.

This evidence was elicited by the 4th accused during cross-

examination of the Registrar of the Court, who was called by the

prosecution to produce the statutory statements of the four accused. The

non-summary proceedings conducted before the Magistrates Court of

Matara in case No. 65932 contained an entry made on 09.07.2007 that the 4th

accused, after surrendering to Court through his Attorney, informed that

he sustained injuries during this incident and did not receive any medical

treatment. Later in the same day, another application was made on behalf

of the 4th accused, seeking an order of Court to produce him before a JMO.

The Court only made an order directing the prison authorities to provide

the necessary medical treatment to the accused through its hospital.

The motion filed by the 4th accused in this regard on 09.07.2007

made no reference at least to the fact that he has suffered any injury. It

only stated that he was wanted by the police in connection with the

murder of the deceased and he wishes to surrender himself to Court.

This is evident from the cross examination of the Registrar, who

read out a journal of the Magistrates Court case record containing the

non-summary proceedings. Although it was recorded in that journal entry

that the 4th accused sustained injuries during the incident, no description

of the nature of the injuries, the number of such injuries, the weapon used

to inflict them or the person who inflicted them were disclosed. This is an

important factor, and it was the first available opportunity for the 4th

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

26

accused to place that position clearly on record through his Counsel. It is

relevant to note in this context that the 4th accused has surrendered to

Court through his Counsel, who had the case called in open Court through

a motion. No application was made on behalf of the 4th accused to produce

him before a JMO at this initial stage and for a report as to the nature of

any injuries alleged to have sustained by him.

Apparently, the Court has decided to limit its intervention at that

stage merely to make note of said claim of the 4th accused. The Court

decided to adopt that approach, upon after enquiry of the 4th accused, who

admitted that for the past four days, he has not taken any steps to have his

injuries treated. The Court probably have decided not to make an order for

it had the benefit of visually verifying the claim made by the 4th accused.

The record does not bear of an indication that the 4th accused has offered

any reason for his inaction. When the case was called once more in open

Court in the same day on the request of the Counsel for the 4th accused,

who moved Court that his client be produced before the JMO, the Court

was not impressed and only directed the prison authorities to provide the

necessary medical treatment.

The approach adopted by the Magistrates Court in this particular

case seemed justified as the 4th accused did not have any visible injuries on

him. This is supported by the observations made by the officer when he

visited the Prisons, in order to record his statement. In the absence of any

suggestion put to the official witness, that it could reasonably be inferred

from the evidence adduced through that witness that, during his visit to

interview the 4th accused, the latter did not show any injuries nor made

any reference to them in his statement.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

27

Although this is not the position taken up by the 4th accused during

his cross examination of the prosecution witnesses, even if one were to

take the evidence of the 4th accused, that the deceased stabbed him after

the incident, and it is a position that he maintained consistently, still it

would not make any difference in terms of his liability. The claim that the

deceased was armed with a knife and used same to stab the 4th accused

after he was hit on the head, is clearly an improbable version, in view of

the expert opinion of the Consultant JMO, who confirmed that the

deceased could not have been able even to speak after the injury No. 1 that

was observed on the front left of his head.

The description of the said injury, as given by the Consultant JMO,

indicate that as a deep laceration measuring 7 X 6 X 4 centimetres in size.

Corresponding to the said external injury, the Consultant JMO has

observed an underlying comminute depressed fracture measuring 17 X 8

centimetres in size, situated over the left frontal-temporal and parietal area

of the skull, in addition to another fissure fracture (corresponding to injury

No. 2), extending to the occipital area, extending to the base of the skull

through the anterior cranial fossa. He also noted that the membranes of the

brain too were lacerated, along with the brain matter. Parts of brain tissue,

which came out through the fractured skull, was also observed by the

medical expert.

It is his opinion that a heavy blunt weapon, similar to that of a rice

pounder, may have been used in causing these injuries, causing necessarily

fatal injuries to the deceased. The Consultant JMO further observed that

the left upper arm of the deceased too was fractured due to application of

blunt force, which he attributed to a defensive injury. Accordingly, the

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

28

claim made by the 4th accused that the deceased has stabbed him after the

incident could clearly be equated to a near impossibility.

If one were to consider the position that the alleged act of stabbing

of the 4th accused has taken place prior to the incident by which the

deceased has suffered fatal injuries, which the only eyewitness has

consistently denied of, it is reasonable to expect that the knife used in the

stabbing should have been lying at the scene after the act of stabbing. The

deceased was rushed to hospital soon after the incident. All four accused

fled the scene immediately afterwards and surrendered to authorities at a

later point of time. The eyewitness and the wife of the deceased proceeded

to the police to make complaints. Neither the prosecution nor the accused

thought it fit to clarify from the investigator that whether it was revealed

during investigations that there was a knife, which may have used in the

incident, or whether such a weapon was lying among the small pieces of

club, or whether any other person removed the same from the scene.

Thus, in effect there was no evidence placed before the trial Court

to indicate that the 4th accused sustained any stab injury during the

incident he speaks of. The evidence referred by the 4th accused, points

only to the fact that he made such a claim to the Magistrates Court, at the

time of surrendering to it through his legal Counsel. Therefore, the

assertions of the 4th accused taking up the positions that the injuries he has

sustained are stab injuries, a knife was used in that attack, and it was the

deceased who inflicted these injuries, were presented for the first time

before the High Court, and that too after eight years since the incident by

which the deceased suffered his injuries.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

29

Reverting back to the primary issue that whether the conclusions

reached by the Court of Appeal and as well as the High Court could be

considered erroneous when those Courts rejected the 4th accuseds claim

for the concession in terms of exception 4 of Section 294, it is necessary in

that respect to refer back to the judgment of this Court in Bandara v The

Attorney General (supra) once more. This is in order to highlight another

important aspect which requires consideration in relation to the instant

appeal. That judgment considered an instance where the appellant has

dealt a blow on the head of the deceased and thereby causing his death.

The appellant made an attempt to have his case brought within the

Exception 4 of Section 294. However, the Court was not impressed with the

contention advanced by the appellant as the evidence clearly indicate that

the fight referred to by the appellant is not spontaneous and therefore

cannot be regarded as one that could be described as sudden and proceeded to

dismiss his appeal.

Since strong emphasis was laid by the 4th accused in his contention

of the existence of a sudden fight, it is prudent to examine the Exception 4

as the first step in order to understand the context in which the term

sudden fight was used by the Legislature in Exception 4 by consideration

of the wording used in that exception. The most relevant part in relation

to the instant appeal of the said Exception is the section that reads in a

sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel. The said exception

speaks of sudden fight which results upon a sudden quarrel. These

phrases were used by the Legislature to denote a position that reflects a

transformation of a quarrel to a fight within a very short duration of time.

It is important to note in this context that the word sudden appears twice

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

30

in the text of the said Exception and that too, after the phrase without

premeditation. The emphasis laid in the text of the section on the

spontaneity of the act which resulted in the death of a person is therefore

clearly recognisable.

In the absence of any definition provided in the Penal Code either to

a fight or to a quarrel, in the context of the contentions that were placed

before this Court, it is helpful to consider the words fight and quarrel

for its general meaning in the English language, in order to understand the

purpose of inserting these two words by the Legislature in the said

Exception.

The general dictionary meaning of a quarrel is given as a heated

argument or disagreement, typically about a trivial issue and between people who

are usually on good terms whereas the meaning of fight is given as to take

part in a violent struggle involving the exchange of physical blows or the use of

weapons. The meaning attributed to the word quarrel by Blacks Law

Dictionary (5th ED), is an altercation, an angry dispute, an exchange of

recriminations, taunts, threats or accusations between two persons whereas the

meaning to the word fight is described as a hostile encounter or

engagement between opposing forces suggesting primarily the notion of

brawl or unpremeditated encounter following a judicial pronouncement in

Gitlow v Kiely, D.C.N.Y. 44 F.2d 227, 232.

The dictionary meaning of these two words might not necessarily

convey the entire scope of the words quarrel and fight, as found in the

Exception 4. The mere absence of a statutory definition in the Penal Code

provided to these two words and for this Court to make an attempt to

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

31

provide a judicial definition to them, in order to fill that void, might not be

the best approach as such an interpretation carried the potential of unduly

restricting the multitude of circumstances the Legislature may have

envisaged to cater by refraining from providing any. This is evident when

one examines the Chapter II of the Penal Code under the heading General

Explanations where the Code, in Section 5 to 51 denotes each of the words

and phrases used therein. When confronted with similar situations, on

many instances, Courts have consciously refrained from providing one.

In Fernando v Nesadurai (1948) 49 NLR 263, upon being presented

with a contention that the Court is required to provide a definition to the

word building, that appear in the text of the Housing and Town

Improvement Ordinance , Basnayake J ( as he then was) has taken the view

(at p. 264) that [I]t will be unsafe to make this case the occasion for attempting

to define on an expression which even the Legislature has left alone. His

lordship, in forming that view, has noted that a dictionary is not always a

safe guide in the construction of a statute and quoted the dicta of an

English judgment in Stevens v Gourley (1859) 7 CBNS 99, where Byles J

stated that [T]he imperfections of human language renders it not only difficult,

but also impossible to define the word building. Shaw J, also adopted a similar

view in Attorney General v Rodriguesz (1966) 19 NLR 65, when the Court

was to determine the effect of the word concerned in Section 104 of

Customs Ordinance. In that context, his Lordship has stated that in the

matter before that Court (at p. 78) [V]ery little assistance can be obtained from

the dictionary meaning of that word.

This cautious approach, which has consistently been adopted

by the Courts in situations such as this, infuses a certain degree of

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

32

pragmatism into the task of providing a meaning to a particular word

used in a Section, as it endeavour to do so without imposing any undue

restrictions to the scope of the statutory provisions contained in that

Section, in order to cover a wider spectrum of situations, which the

Legislature would have envisaged to cater in the first place by enacting

that Section, as indicative from its act of making an insertion of that

particular word into the text of the statute, but refrained itself from

providing a specific meaning to that particular word. In forming that view,

I derive support from a statement of Bindra on Interpretation of Statutes (9th

Ed, at p. 59) [W]hen an expression is not defined in the statute and such

expression happens to be one of everyday use, it must be construed in popular

sense, as understood in common parlance, and not in any technical sense.

The case of Mahinda Rajapaksa v Kudahetti and Others (1992) 2 Sri

L.R. 223 is an instance where it was alleged that the respondents have

acted in violation of the Article 13(1) of the Constitution, where it

guarantees that to no person shall be arrested except according to

procedure established by law and what constituted an arrest in terms of

that Article. I need not add any to what was stated so succinctly by

Amerasinghe J, (at p. 243): I do not intend this to be a definition of "arrest". A

definition, I suppose, must await the wisdom of the future. Nor is it an attempt to

lay down general guidelines concerning other situations not involved here. I do

not even suggest that a bright line can be easily drawn that separates the type of

deprivation of liberty within the reach of Article 13 (1) from the type without.

Close questions undoubtedly will sometimes arise in the grey area that necessarily

exists in between. Whether an act amounts to an arrest will depend on the

circumstances of each case.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

33

But that does not mean, that the essential attributes of words,

quarrel and fight, could not be identified in the sense that they were

used in that exception. In Bandara v The Attorney General (supra) this

Court held that the available evidence did not satisfy the spontaneity of

the attack on the deceased and therefore the appellant is not entitled to

relief under Exception 4.

In my view, the phrase in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon

a sudden quarrel, of the Exception 4 of Section 294 clearly envisages a

situation, which started off perhaps with a mere verbal disagreement or an

argument between rival parties which then takes a violent turn with

sudden escalation of that quarrel into a fight during which exchange of

physical blows or use of weapons occurs between them, resulting in the

fatality in question. The start of the quarrel and its escalation into a fight

must happen within a short duration of time. The emphasis placed by the

Section on the progressive but sudden escalation of the intensity of the

degree of passion with which the opposing parties acts in a quarrel

culminating with the act or acts that results in the fatality could easily be

discerned from the phrase in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a

sudden quarrel. That seems to be the sequence events that envisaged by the

Legislature in enacting Exception 4 in that form.

It must however be stressed at this point that is not possible to lay

down a general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden fight in

terms of Exception 4, since it essentially is a question of fact which in turn

depends upon the established facts of each individual case. The dictionary

meaning of the words quarrel and fight were inserted in the preceding

paragraph not as an attempt to provide binding definitions to these words,

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

34

but only to highlight the emphasis on the gradual escalation of the

intensity of passion with which the parties engage in the act of physical

combat, as suggested by Bindra, by stating that it must be construed in

popular sense, as understood in common parlance, and not in any technical

sense.

It could therefore be reasonably deduced from this reasoning that

the Exception 4 applies only to such situations and the act which results in a

death of a person was committed in the heat of passion, during the

existence of sudden fight commencing from the point of the start of the

quarrel and escalating it into a fight, culminating with a spontaneous act,

on the part of the accused, without allowing any cooling time in between.

The Supreme Court of India, in its judgment of Bhagwan Munjaji

Pawade v State of Maharastra AIR 1979 SC 133, dealt with a situation

where the deceased, who had just returned home and, upon seeing that his

mother was engaged in a heated argument with the appellant, enquired

from him as to the reason for such an altercation. Thereupon, the

appellant has attacked the deceased thrice on his head with an axe, twice

with the blunt side and once with its sharp side.

In such circumstances, the Court held that a [F]ight postulates a

bilateral transaction in which blows are exchanged. The deceased was unarmed.

He did not cause any injury to the appellant or his companions. Furthermore, not

less than three fatal injuries were inflicted by the appellant with an axe, which is a

formidable weapon on the unarmed victim. Appellant, is therefore, not entitled to

the benefit of Exception 4, either.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

35

Similar process of reasoning was adopted by that Court in its

judgment of State Of Orissa vs Khageswar Naik & Others (2013) SCC

649, in order to set aside the conviction already entered against the accused

for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis

of a sudden fight, and in order to alter the same into a conviction for

murder. The Court considered the evidence and decided to interfere with

the conviction entered erroneously by the lower Court for the lessor

offence on the footing that there was no fight between the accused and

the deceased, since the evidence indicated that it was only a one-sided

attack. The Court stated [I]n the case in hand, the convicts had entered the

room of the daughter of the deceased in midnight, molested her and the poor father,

perhaps because of his age, could not do anything other than to abuse the convicts.

He gave choicest abuses but did not fight with the convicts. Verbal abuses are not

fight as it is well settled that at least two persons are needed to fight. Therefore,

this ingredient is not satisfied.

I am strongly persuaded to accept the validity of the reasoning

adopted by the Indian Supreme Court in these judgments in relation to the

instant appeal, as the underlying principle that had been enunciated upon

the factual considerations contained therein are very similar, if not, almost

identical, with the evidence presented before the trial Court on this

particular aspect. In view of the reasoning contained in the preceding

paragraphs, I am of the firm view that there was no sudden fight, in terms

of Exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code, between any of the four

accused and the deceased. The several judgments that were cited by the

learned Counsel for the 4th accused from the same jurisdiction, are in

relation to instances where there has in fact been a sudden fight between

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

36

the deceased and his assailants and thereby offers no assistance to

determine the issues presented for determination in the instant appeal.

However, in Ghapoo Yadave and Others v State of Orissa AIR 2003

SC 1620, a judgment relied upon by the learned Counsel for the 4th

accused, the apex Court India has stated that [A] fight suddenly takes place,

for which both parties are more or less to be blamed. It may be that one of them

starts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct it would not

have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual provocation and

aggravation, and it is difficult to apportion the share of blame which attaches to

each fighter.

It is in the light of these principles I now proceed to consider the

contention of the 4th accused that he was denied the concession of lessor

culpability in terms of Exception 4.

Amali speaks of two incidents. First, she speaks of the incident over

the demand of fish made by the four accused. Second, she speaks of an

incident by which the deceased has suffered several fatal injuries on his

head. It is clear from the evidence of the prosecution that the first incident

ended without any form of violence, although the accused have indicated

their strong displeasure of Amalis husbands intervention into their

interaction with the particular fish dealer, by throwing the key on the

ground and uttering what seemed a veiled threat.

The deceased has never featured any time during the entirety of the

first incident, although he lived adjacent to the open space, where the lorry

was parked at. It is highly probable that the deceased was privy to the

circumstances which has taken place during the first incident. That

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

37

incident involved his own bother, his partner of business in the fish trade,

with the four accused, who are his neighbours. Nonetheless, the deceased

did not come out of his house even to enquire as to what was happening.

He waited in his house until the incident had peacefully ended and his

brother returned to his house. The deceased, after emerging out of his

house and before crossing over to the other side where the four accused

have stood, did not speak to his brother or to any of the accused.

Amali stated in her evidence that after the first incident, she and her

husband have returned from the open area and remained in front of their

house, which was about 60 feet further up from the deceaseds house. This

evidence is indicative of a significant time gap between the end of the first

incident and the commencement of the second incident. The four accused,

who have gathered in front of the 1st accuseds house, did nothing to

provoke any person since the first incident. They made no reference to the

deceased. It is at this point only the deceased emerged from his house. He

calmly walked up to the group of men, who remained on the other side of

the road motionless. The deceased did not carry any weapon with him and

did not make any accusation or any derogatory remark on any of the

accused.

Similarly, none of the accused carried any weapon or something

which could have been used to an attack on another. Clearly, the deceased

had no reason whatsoever, even to suspect a hint of animosity harboured

against him by any of the four accused or of an imminent violent attack.

The deceased, the 1st and 2nd accused have lived in houses, which are

located on either side of the Galle-Matara highway and were facing each

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

38

other. During cross-examination of Amali, it was suggested that there was

no prior enmity that existed between the accused and the deceased, and

the witness readily conceded that point. It was also elicited from the

eyewitness that the deceased is a person with a quiet disposition and not a

quick-tempered individual.

Prosecution version is that the moment the deceased came near the

four accused, he was surrounded by all four of them, and without issuing

any prior indication of any violence, they collectively mounted a surprise

and sustained attack on him. The four accused have repeatedly punched

the deceased with their fists. In order to counter this version, as to the

commencement of the attack on the deceased, the 4th accused suggested

that the deceased came near them, and he was armed with a knife. The

position sought to be advanced by the 4th accused from that suggestion is

that the deceased, without any provocation by any of them, has suddenly

stabbed him which act compelled him to strike back at the attacker with a

fence post, in order to protect himself.

The 4th accused, who cross examined the official witness, through

the same Counsel who surrendered him to the Magistrates Court, did not

clarify whether it was revealed during investigations a knife was used in

the attack or of the discovery of the information indicating that he too has

been stabbed by the deceased.

It could easily be understood as to why the 4th accused now cling on

to the position that there was a sudden fight during which he too was

stabbed by the deceased. Even if the 4th accused could establish that he

was stabbed by the deceased after the incident, the evidence failed to

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

39

establish that there was a sudden fight, in terms of the Exception 4 of

Section 294 of the Penal Code. I shall explain the reasons for the said

conclusion in the following paragraphs.

The evidence of the prosecution, which the trial Court has found to

be credible and reliable, indicate that no sooner the deceased came near the

four men, he was surrounded by them and was repeatedly attacked with

their arms. The injury No. 3, that was observed by the Consultant JMO

during post mortem examination is a contusion, measured 9 X 8

centimetres and situated over the right parotid area of the face. It was his

opinion that the said injury could have been caused by a clenched fist.

However, injury No. 2, a laceration measuring 3 X 1 centimetres was

observed over the right mandibular area, had caused a fracture of the

mandible with subcutaneous haemorrhage, which could also have been

caused if attacked with a clenched fist. He was further of the opinion that

it could well be an attack by hand with a knuckleduster on, in view of the

force required to cause a fracture to the mandible.

The evidence presented by the prosecution with regard to the

commencement and continuation of the attack on the deceased revealed

that he did not even attempt to attack any of the four men, who launched a

surprise attack on him when he came near them. It was clearly a one side

attack, which left no room at all for the unsuspecting and unarmed

deceased, even to run away from his attackers. Then the 1st accused ran

into his house, returned with a rice pounder, which the 4th accused has

grabbed and used to hit the deceased on his head. The fracture that was

observed by the Consultant JMO on the left humorous associated with

hematoma in muscles is the only defensive injury seen on the body of the

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

40

deceased. It is an indication of the swift and surprise attack unleashed by

the four accused on the deceased, before the latter being clubbed to death

by the 4th accused.

What is important to note from the above description and analysis of

the evidence is the fact that there was no fight between the deceased and

the four accused, though the assault on him seemed to be a sudden one. Of

course, the prosecution did not present any evidence pointing in the

direction that the attack on the deceased is a premeditated one where the

four accused have planned out the details or have acted in prior concert.

No one could have predicted that the deceased to come out of his house

and walk up to the group of men, who were standing on the other side of

the road. The stomach contents of 500 grams of rice, noted by the

consultant JMO, indicate that the deceased was just after his lunch and, as

the eye witness opined during cross examination, that he may have

walked up to the accused perhaps to mediate the dispute or to pacify the

obviously agitated men.

It could easily be understood as to why the 4th accused now cling on

to the position that there was a sudden fight during which he too was

stabbed by the deceased. Even if the 4th accused could establish that he

was stabbed by the deceased after the incident , the evidence failed to

establish that there was a sudden fight, in terms of the Exception 4 of

Section 294 of the Penal Code. I shall explain the reasons for the said

conclusion in the following paragraphs.

The evidence of the prosecution, which the trial Court has found to

be credible and reliable, indicate that no sooner the deceased came near the

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

41

four men, he was surrounded by them and was repeatedly attacked with

their arms. The injury No. 3, that was observed by the Consultant JMO

during post mortem examination is a contusion, which measured 9 X 8

centimetres and situated over the right parotid area of the face. It was his

opinion that the said injury could have been caused by a clenched fist.

However, injury No. 2, a laceration measuring 3 X 1 centimetres was

observed over the right mandibular are, causing fracture of the mandible

with subcutaneous haemorrhage, also could have been caused, if attacked

with a clenched fist. He was also of the opinion that it could well be an

attack by hand with a knuckleduster on, in view of the force required to

cause a fracture to the mandible.

The evidence presented by the prosecution with regard to the

commencement and continuation of the attack on the deceased revealed

that he did not even once attack any of the four men, who launched a

surprise attack when he came near them. It was clearly a one side attack,

which left no room at all for the unsuspecting and unarmed deceased even

to run away from his attackers. Then the 1st accused ran into his house,

returned with a rice pounder, which the 4th accused has grabbed and used

to hit the deceased on his head. The fracture that was observed by the

Consultant JMO on the left humorous associated with hematoma in

muscles is the only defensive injury seen on the body of the deceased. It is

an indication of the swift and surprise attack unleashed by the four

accused on the deceased, before the latter being clubbed to death by the 4th

accused.

What is important to note from the above description and analysis of

the evidence is the fact that there was no fight between the deceased and

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

42

the four accused in terms of the Exception 4, although the assault on him

seemed a sudden one. Of course, the prosecution did not present any

evidence pointing in the direction that the attack on the deceased is a

premeditated one where the four accused have planned out the details or

have acted in prior concert. No one could have predicted that the deceased

to come out of his house and walk up to the group of men, who were

standing on the other side of the road. The stomach contents of 500 grams

of rice, noted by the consultant JMO, indicate that the deceased was just

after his lunch and, as the eye witness opined during cross examination,

that he may have walked up to the accused perhaps to mediate the dispute

or to pacify the obviously agitated men.

One more factor that could not be ignored from the medical

evidence is that the severity of the attack on the head of the deceased, who

had no weapon with him or made no attempt to act in a violent manner.

Certainly, the 4th accused has taken an undue advantage over an unarmed

person, who did not even utter a single word to attract the overtly

disproportionate response from the 4th accused who acted cruelly or in an

unusual manner. Even if all the other attributes of a sudden fight are

satisfied, the 4th accused, by his attack on the deceased had clearly

disqualified himself on this factor from receiving the concession of lessor

culpability in terms of Exception 4.

I have already reached the conclusion that the 4th accused failed to

establish the death of the deceased was due to a sudden fight that erupted

between the two to the required degree of proof. In view of that

conclusion, one of the questions of law on which this appeal was argued

requires consideration at this stage. That question of law reads as follows :

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

43

Has the Court of Appeal erred in failing to evaluate the evidence in

the case in its totality and the failure to appreciate the same and on

an impartial and objective evaluation of the evidence, there was

clearly, at the very least, a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the 4th

accused ?.

In terms of the said question of law, particularly the words that

at the very least, a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the 4th accused, requires

that it should be taken into consideration in conjunction with other

questions of law as all the questions of law are primarily concerned with

the application of relevant legal principles that are involved with the

Exception 4 of Section 294. Whether the reasonable doubt of which the said

question of law speaks of has arisen in relation to the prosecution case

taken in its entirety or whether in relation to the question of sudden fight

could not clearly distinguished from the manner in which the said

question was presented. Hence, for the purpose of completeness and

notwithstanding the apparent contradiction between the said question of

law and the pronouncement made by Howard CJ in the judgment of The

King v James Chandrasekera (supra) in relation to the Exception 4 of

Section 294, it was decided that both these aspects would be addressed at

this segment of the judgment.

The pronouncement made by Howard CJ in the said judgment

stating that it shall regard he inflicted the fatal blows on the deceased during a

sudden fight till it is satisfied that he did so or that it is so probable that he did so

that a prudent man should act on that supposition is clear in what it meant.

When the said principle of law propounded by his Lordship is applied to

the instant appeal, it ought to be read that it was for the 4th accused to

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

44

satisfy the trial Court that he did so or that it is so probable that he did so

that a prudent man should act on that supposition. Owing to the reasons

that I have already set out in the preceding paragraphs and, in view of the

conclusion reached on that reasoning that the 4th accused has failed to

establish that the death of the deceased was due to a sudden fight to the

required degree of proof, there cannot be a residual issue, whether he

could still succeed if there is a reasonable doubt as to the death of the

deceased had resulted in due to a sudden fight between the two,

remaining to be determined, in terms of the pronouncement made by

Howard CJ.

This residual issue which dealing with the impact of a reasonable

doubt would have on the applicability of Exception 4 to Section 294 has

already been considered in length by Soertsz J in The King v James

Chandrasekera (supra). In order to present the most relevant part of the

dicta of Soertsz J on which I intend to rely in support of my view and, in

order to present same in the exact context in which it was made, it is

necessary to quote his Lordship to a greater extent, including the

contention that had been presented by the appellant before that Court.

Soertsz J having considered the legality of the said contention, states (at p.

125) that:

[I]t is often possible to test the validity of an argument by carrying

it to what would be its logical conclusion. If we take that course with

the main argument submitted to us, the resulting position would be

that, although Section 105 requires the existence of circumstances

bringing the case within an exception to be proved by the accused, he

would satisfy the requirement even though the existence of these

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

45

circumstances is left in doubt by him, that is to say is not proved by

him, for section 3 says that a fact is not proved when it is neither

proved nor disproved. Such a conclusion appears to me to refute the

argument.

The position is however different in cases in which, by involving the

fact in issue in sufficient doubt the accused ipso facto involves in

such doubt an element of the offence that the prosecution had to

prove. That, for instance, would have been the position under our

law in the Woolmington case, if on the charge of murder, or all the

matters before them, the Jury were in sufficient doubt as to whether

the death of the deceased girl was the result of an accident or not, for,

in that state of doubt, the Jury are necessarily as much in doubt

whether the intention to cause death or to cause an injury sufficient

in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death, existed or not. In

such a case, the proper view seems to me to be that.

In respect of the questions which I currently dealing with, it would

suffice if I confine myself simply by quoting the last sentence of the above

quotation as an answer, as it reads thus; the accused succeeds in avoiding

the charge of murder, not because he has established his defence, but because, by

involving the essential element of intention in doubt, he has produced the result

that the prosecution has not established a necessary part of its case.

Thus, the applicable principle of law is that if there is a reasonable

doubt that exists in the mind of the trial Judge in relation to the

prosecution case, then that reasonable doubt ought to have existed in

relation to an essential element of intention, which the prosecution must

establish, in terms of its overall burden as per dicta of Woolmingtons case. It

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

46

certainly could not be on the question whether the prosecution has proved

beyond reasonable doubt that the 4th accused has inflicted the fatal injuries

on the deceased during a sudden fight or not. Of course, the fact that it

was the 4th accused who caused the fatal injury on the deceased with a

murderous intention, being an essential element of the offence of murder,

must be established beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution, which it

did.

But it was for the 4th accused to satisfy the trial Court that there was

a sudden fight and it is not for the prosecution to establish there was none.

However, there was no contention advanced before us that any one or

more of the essential elements which the prosecution is obligated to

establish to the required degree of proof, had not been established and on

that basis the 4th accused is entitled to be acquitted. The contention before

us was that the 4th accused is entitled to be found guilty to the lessor

offence on the basis of the Exception 4 of Section 294 of the Penal Code on

the available evidence, as there is a reasonable doubt exists whether there

was a sudden fight or not.

In The King v James Chandrasekera (supra), Howard CJ has quoted

Dunkley J., from the Full Bench case of Emperor v Damapala (1937) A. I. R.

Rangoon 83, where it was stated that:

[I]n a criminal trial the burden of proving everything essential to

the establishment of the charge against the accused lies upon the

prosecution, and that burden never changes. But it would clearly

impose an impossible task on the prosecution if the prosecution were

required to anticipate every possible defence of the accused and to

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

47

establish that each such defence could not be made out, and of this

task the prosecution is relieved by the provisions of section 105 and

its closely allied section, section 106. Section 105 enacts that the

burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case

within any general or special exception in the Penal Code shall lie

upon the accused, and the Court shall presume the absence of such

circumstances.

In this particular context, the pronouncement made by Howard CJ in

The King v James Chandrasekera (supra and at p.115) becomes very

relevant. His Lordship stated that [I]t may be conceded that one of the

reasons why the final words of section 105, namely, and the Court shall

presume the absence of such circumstances , may have been inserted was so as to

make it clear that the non-existence of such circumstances was not a matter to be

established by the prosecution as under the old law. On the other hand, the fact

that such words have been inserted seems to manifest only too clearly the burden

cast on the accused.

Hearne J, who associated himself with the reasoning of the majority

judgment in The King v James Chandrasekera (supra), added a further

component to the principles they have enunciated in that judgment, in a

subsequent pronouncement. In The King v Johanis et al (1943) 44 NLR 145

(at p. 146) Hearne J states thus:

if the existence of circumstances which would bring the case

within one of the exceptions is involved in doubt, the existence of

those circumstances cannot be said to have been proved. It does not

lay down that if two possible views may be taken of a set of proved

circumstances, the Jury is precluded from adopting either or those

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

48

two views. In fact, as-it appears to me, just as inevitably as one

cannot have one side of a sheet of paper without the other, there

cannot be one view of a matter and not the contrary view as well. If,

for instance, an accused rests his defence upon exception 1 of section

294 of the Penal Code, the Jury may decide that he has proved,

within the meaning of proof in section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance,

the circumstances alleged by him and yet may hold or not hold that

he lost his self-control in consequence of the provocation to which he

was subjected. Similarly, when circumstances are in evidence which

the Jury regard as having been proved, they may or may not hold

that those circumstances established that there was a sudden fight,

upon a sudden quarrel, and that the accused " did not take undue

advantage, &c.". It is only if they are in doubt as to whether they

should or should not hold that circumstances existed which brought

the case within exception 4 of section 294 of the Penal Code, that the

existence of such circumstances cannot be said to have been proved.

Even if two views are possible, they may have no doubt as to which

of these views they prefer to take on the basis of probability.

In view of these multiple considerations, even if the case for the 4th

accused is taken at its highest by this Court and proceeds on the basis that

it in fact creates a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case as to whether

there was a sudden fight, the 4th accused is nonetheless not entitled to any

relief under Exception 4 of Section 294, in terms of The King v James

Chandrasekera (supra). It is relevant to note in this regard that Prof. G.L.

Peiris, in his book Offences under the Penal Code of Ceylon, after making a

reference to principle enunciated in the said judgment, states that (at p.

102), in a case where a general or special exception under the Penal Code is

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

49

pleaded, a reasonable doubt created in the minds of the jury as to the applicability

of the exception does not render the accused entitled to its benefit.

In this context, I wish to add another important factor to this

consideration. In the consideration of the applicability of general

exceptions of Section 294, the trial Courts are, in the absence of evidence in

that regard, not expected to speculate. The Court of Criminal Appeal, in

the case of Fernando et al v The Queen (1952) 54 NLR 255, relied on the

pronouncements made by English Courts in The King v Catherine Thorpe

(1925) 18 Cr. A. R. 189, and Mancini v Director of Public

Prosecutions (1942) A. C. 1, to reach the conclusion that [A] jury should be

told to accept or reject evidence that they are entitled to and should draw

reasonable inferences from the evidence which they accept, but they should never

be directed in a way which opens for them the door to conjecture. This is necessary

not only in order that the case for the defence may not, be prejudiced but also in

the interests of the prosecution. It has to be remembered that a trial judge by

suggesting an unsustainable element of evidence in favour of an accused may by

rendering a verdict founded on that element unreasonable make the verdict itself

unsustainable.

Before I conclude this judgment by determining the several

questions of law, there is one more contention that was advanced by the 4th

accused which merits consideration.

The indictment against the four accused was presented by the

prosecution on the basis that all of them were actuated by a common

murderous intention to cause the death of the deceased. After trial, the

High Court concluded that the 2nd and 3rd accused were not guilty to the

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

50

offence of murder on the premise they did not entertain any common

murderous intention. Only the 1st and 4th accused were found guilty of

murder. When the 1st accused preferred an appeal against his conviction

for murder, the Court of Appeal decided to reduce his culpability from

murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. On that particular

finding made by the appellate Court, the 4th accused presented a

contention before this Court claiming that, in doing so, the appellate Court

has failed to consider that he too could have been convicted for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of a sudden fight, as facts

and circumstances of the case are similar if not identical to that of the 1st

accused.

Perusal of the impugned judgment indicates that the appellate Court

decided to reduce the culpability of the 1st accused upon placing reliance

on the evidence that it was the 4th accused who attacked the deceased. The

Court also noted that the role played by the 1st accused is limited to

bringing out the rice pounder from his house. It is important to note in this

regard that the Court of Appeal made no positive pronouncement over the

question whether there was a sudden fight, nor did it find fault with the

trial Court for arriving at a negative finding on this particular question of

fact, contrary to the evidence presented before that Court. Having noted

that the 1st accused did not attack the deceased with the rice pounder and

he only brought the same into the scene of the incident, the Court of

Appeal has thought it fit to reduce his culpability to culpable homicide not

amounting to murder and it did so, after setting aside his conviction for

murder.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

51

The 4th accused is clearly not entitled to that concession. It has

already been held that there was no sudden fight in terms of the Exception

4 of Section 294. In addition, the Court of Appeal, in determining, although

perfunctorily, that it should reduce the culpability of the 1st accused,

appears to have acted on the evidence which points in the direction that

the 1st accused, by merely bringing in the rice pounder, had acted only

with knowledge rather than on a murderous intention.

In affirming the finding of fact made by the trial Court that the 4th

accused attacked the deceased with a rice pounder with a murderous

intention on his head and thereby causing a fatal injury, the Court of

Appeal decided to dismiss his appeal. The appellate Court was of the view

that there was no evidence to impute joint criminal liability under Section

32 of the Penal Code on the 1st and 4th accused and decided to affirm the

conviction for the 4th accused to the offence of murder after imposing

criminal liability for his induvial action of fatally injuring the deceased and

not on the basis that he shared common murderous intention with any of

the other three accused. That being the basis on which the Court of Appeal

has acted, the 4th accused cannot claim any concession on the basis of a

diminished responsibility, merely because of the 1st accused was found to

have committed the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to

murder on the basis of knowledge.

The questions of law on which the instant appeal was presented and

heard are therefore answered in the negative. The conviction entered by

the High Court against the 4th accused for murder and the approval of that

conclusion by the Court of Appeal are hereby affirmed.

S.C. Appeal No.168/2018

52

The appeal of the 4th accused is accordingly dismissed.
