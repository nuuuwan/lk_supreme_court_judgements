Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Matara seeking a

declaration of title to the land described in the Grant marked P2 dated

08.08.1984 issued under the Land Development Ordinance, the

ejectment of the two defendants from Lot 1 in Plan No. 1481 dated

20.03.2006 marked P1 and damages. The defendants filed answer

seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action on the basis that they have

acquired Lot 1 by prescriptive possession. After trial, the District Court

dismissed the plaintiffs action. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal

of Matara set aside the judgment of the District Court and entered

judgment for the plaintiff. This appeal by the defendants is from the

judgment of the High Court. This Court granted leave to appeal on the

following question of law:

Having come to the correct conclusion as to the right of the 1st

defendant to prescribe to the portion of land in dispute (Lot 1 in Plan

No. 1481) against the plaintiff, did the High Court err in holding that

the prescriptive claim of the 1st defendant must necessarily fail,

notwithstanding the analysis of evidence by the District Judge?

Although the Grant was issued in 1984, the land had not been physically

demarcated on the ground with the assistance of a government surveyor.

There is no dispute that the land to the north of Lot 1 has been in

possession of the defendants at least since 1984. The defendants also

have a Grant for their land. Both parties have been in possession of these

adjoining parcels of land well prior to the issuance of the Grants as Permit

holders under the Land Development Ordinance. According to the

evidence led, they appear to have been residing on these lands for

generations.

3

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

The red lines on Plan No. 1481 do not represent the existing boundary

lines. They were drawn after the superimposition of the Final Village Plan

on the existing boundaries of the plaintiffs land. According to the

superimposition, the plaintiff has encroached on others lands from all

sides, including a portion of the defendants land along its southern

boundary. However, no one, including the defendants, appears to be

complaining about these encroachments by the plaintiff, perhaps

because the existing boundaries have remained unchanged for a long

time.

The plaintiff came to know that Lot 1 is part of his land only after the

government surveyor surveyed the land and demarcated the correct

boundaries on 01.01.2003, which is approximately 19 years after the

Grant was issued. The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court on

30.07.2003. This is unequivocally accepted by learned counsel for the

plaintiff in his post-argument written submissions in the following

manner:

Both lands which are abutting each other had been granted to the

plaintiff and 1st defendant in the year 1984. By that time,

boundaries had not been demarcated. Exact boundaries were

demarcated on the ground for the first time in the year 2003 whereby

both parties discovered for the first time that lot 1 of the said plan

though belonging to the plaintiff, has been in possession of the

defendants.

There is no boundary line on the ground between Lot 1 and the

defendants land. There are two latrines in Lot 1 and the old one,

according to the 2nd defendants evidence, had been built in the 1970s.

There is an old plantation in Lot 1, which the 2nd defendant stated to have

been planted by her parents.

4

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

Against this overwhelming evidence supporting a claim for prescriptive

possession, what led the High Court to overturn the judgment of the

District Court?

There is no dispute that Lot 3 in Plan No. 1481 belongs to the plaintiff

and that its northern boundary is the defendants land. Although Lot 2

in Plan No. 1481 is part of Lot 3, the superimposition suggests that it

should be part of the defendants land. Regarding the northern boundary

of Lot 3, the learned High Court Judge first makes the following finding:

When one examines the northern boundary of Lot 2 and Lot 3 as

shown in Plan No. 1481, there is a fence on the northern boundary

of Lot 2 and Lot 2 forms part of the northern boundary of Lot 3. A

ditch forms the balance part of the northern boundary in Lot 3. The

surveyor has shown this ditch and the fence as the existing physical

boundary of the corpus.

Plan No. 1481 was marked by the plaintiff as P1. The surveyor was not

called to give evidence. The plaintiff relies on this Plan. According to the

Plan, the northern boundary of the plaintiffs land is the fence and the

ditch, and Lot 1 is possessed by the defendants as part of the defendants

land. Hence, the above finding of the learned High Court Judge that the

northern boundary of Lot 3 is the fence and the ditch is consistent with

the Plan.

Thereafter the learned High Court Judge has changed his mind and

states that there is no physical demarcation of the common boundary

between Lot 1 and Lot 3:

The ditch which is there for mere convenience of possession cannot

be treated as a physical demarcation of the boundary. Therefore the

1st defendant fails to prescribe to Lot 1. To prescribe to Lot 1 the 1st

defendant must possess Lot 1 as a separate entity or she must

5

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

possess it as a part of her land which is situated to the north of the

corpus.

It is purely on this basis that the High Court set aside the judgment of

the District Court and allowed the appeal. I find myself unable to agree

with the latter finding of the learned High Court Judge that the ditch

cannot be treated as a boundary line. In old deeds prepared without

survey plans, it is quite common to identify boundaries using natural or

physical features such as ditches, streams, bunds and trees. A boundary

need not necessarily be a man-made wall or fence. Whether a discernible

boundary exists is purely a question of fact to be determined based on

the unique facts and circumstances of each case. In the instant case, the

fence and the ditch form part of the common boundary between the two

lands. What the learned High Court Judge states is: To prescribe to Lot

1 the 1st defendant must possess Lot 1 as a separate entity or she must

possess it as a part of her land which is situated to the north of the corpus.

This requirement has been satisfied by the defendants. The red line

drawn as the northern boundary of Lot 1 is not the existing boundary but

the superimposed boundary. Admittedly, the 1st defendant possessed Lot

1 as part of his land, which lies to the north of Lot 1.

The case was filed not because the common boundary between the two

lands was indefinite, but because the plaintiff, upon the survey

conducted by the government surveyor, realised that the portion to the

north of the ditch, identified in the Plan as Lot 1 and possessed by the

defendants as part of their land, should rightfully belong to him. For the

aforesaid reasons, the subsequent finding of the learned High Court

Judge that there is no physical boundary between Lot 1 and the plaintiffs

land is unsustainable.

Next, learned counsel for the plaintiff, citing Sirajudeen v. Abbas [1994]

2 Sri LR 365, strenuously submits that the establishment of a starting

6

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

point of prescriptive possession is a sine qua non to succeed in a claim of

prescriptive title, and as the defendants in this case have failed to do so,

the Court must reject the defendants claim without further ado. In

Chelliah v. Wijenathan (1951) 54 NLR 337 at 342, Gratiaen J. stated that

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to

immovable property, the burden of proof rests fairly and squarely on him

to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights.

This was rightly quoted with approval in many cases including the said

judgment of G.P.S. De Silva C.J. in Sirajudeen v. Abbas. No one disputes

this principle in law.

According to the post-argument written submissions of the plaintiffs

counsel himself, which I quoted above, it can be concluded that the

starting point of prescriptive possession is 1984, when the Grant was

issued. I will further explain this below.

The argument of learned counsel for the plaintiff is that the defendants

were not in adverse possession from the date of the Grant on 08.08.1984

until 01.01.2003, when the government surveyor demarcated the

boundaries on the ground because both parties had believed that the

disputed portion (Lot 1) is part of the defendants land. His argument

appears to be that adverse possession commenced on 01.01.2003 and

since the action was instituted in the District Court on 30.07.2003, the

defendants did not have ten-years of possession to succeed in their

prescriptive claim. This is an interesting and important legal point, which

has not come up too often before this Court.

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, insofar as relevant to the present

purposes, reads as follows:

7

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a

defendant in any action, or by those under whom he claims, of lands

or immovable property, by a title adverse to or independent of that

of the claimant or plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession

unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of

service or duty, or by any other act by the possessor, from which an

acknowledgment of a right existing in another person would fairly

and naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the bringing of

such action, shall entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with

costs.

It must be emphasised that adverse possession is not synonymous with

possession acquired or maintained through violent acts. Even assuming,

for the sake of argument, that it were, a possessor who resorts to violence

cannot claim prescriptive title, as such possession would not be

undisturbed and uninterrupted for the requisite period. The necessity of

resorting to violence itself indicates that the possession has been subject

to disturbance and interruption.

What is meant by adverse possession? Simply stated, adverse possession

is possession in a manner incompatible with the title of the true owner.

The parenthetical clause of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance

provides a statutory definition of adverse possession: that is to say, a

possession unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance

of service or duty, or by any other act by the possessor, from which an

acknowledgment of a right existing in another person would fairly and

naturally be inferred. Violence is not a requirement under this definition.

The Privy Council in Cadija Umma v. Don Manis Appu (1938) 40 NLR 392

at 396 observed that although the clause is no mere illustration, it is not

so completely successful an attempt to achieve the full and self-contained

definition as might be wished. However, in Nonis v. Peththa (1969) 73

8

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

NLR 1 at 3, the Privy Council stated that it constitutes a complete

definition, rather than merely an illustration. Whether or not it is a

complete definition, this definition underscores that for possession to be

adverse, it must be exclusive, continuous and exercised as of right,

without any recognition of the ownership of another. In the

circumstances of this case, there can be no doubt that the defendants

possession was of such a character. It is therefore abundantly clear that

the defendants possession was, in fact, adverse in the strict legal sense.

This view finds support in judicial precedent.

In Fernando v. Wijesooriya (1947) 48 NLR 320 at 325, Canekeratne J.

held:

There must be a corporeal occupation of land attended with a

manifest intention to hold and continue it and when the intent plainly

is to hold the land against the claim of all other persons, the

possession is hostile or adverse to the rights of the true owner. It is

the intention to claim the title which makes the possession of the

holder of the land adverse; if it be clear that there is no such intention

there can be no pretence of an adverse possession. It is necessary

to inquire in what manner the person who had been in possession

during the time held it, if he held in a character incompatible with

the idea that the title remained in the claimant to the property it

would follow that the possession in such character was adverse. But

it was otherwise if he held in a character compatible with the

claimants titlehis possession may be on behalf of the claimant or

may be the possession of the claimant (p. 396 of 40 NLR) or from the

conduct of the partys possession an acknowledgment of a right

existing in the claimant could fairly and naturally be inferred. To

prevent the operation of the statute, a parol acknowledgment of the

adverse possession by the person in possession must be such as to

9

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

show that he intends to hold no longer under a claim of right; but

declarations made merely with a view to compromise a dispute are

not sufficientAngel on Limitation p. 388.

The judgment of Walter Pereira J. in Ayanahamy v. Silva (1913) 17 NLR

123 at 125 is directly on the point:

As regards the second point pressed, it seems to me that the fact

that the defendant was not, at the time of his possession of the land

in claim, aware that it belonged to the plaintiff, rather strengthens

his claim based upon prescription. He was a bona fide possessor,

and while a mala fide possessor might, just as well as a bona fide

possessor, maintain a claim by prescription, it is manifest in the case

of the latter, that the possession was a possession on his own

account. It has been argued that the possession of a person

possessing in the belief that the thing possessed is not the property

of another is not adverse possession, and English authorities have

been cited. We have nothing to do with the definition in English law

of either the term possession or the term adverse possession.

Both these terms are fully discussed in the Encyclopaedia of Laws,

vol. I., p. 160, and vol. X., p. 228 (1st edition), and it will be found

that there are points of essential difference in what is laid down

there and our own conception of the terms. Possession under the

Roman-Dutch law is either possessio civilis or possessio naturalis.

Possessio civilis is detentio animo domini. It is this possession that

is necessary to be proved where a person seeks either any of the

possessory remedies or to establish a claim by prescription. Where

a person is in occupation of property in the bona fide (albeit mistake)

belief that the property is his own and belongs to nobody else, clearly

he has the detentio animo domini. The next question is whether his

possession is adverse. As to that we have to look for guidance within

10

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

the four corners of our own Ordinance relating to prescription of

actions. The words in section 3A possession unaccompanied by

payment of rent or produce or performance of service or duty or by

any other act by the possessor from which an acknowledgment of a

right existing in another person would fairly and naturally be

inferredhave been held by this Court to contain not an illustration,

but a definition of adverse possession (see Daniel v. Markar Ram.

1843-55, 2, Vand. Rep. 44, Carrim v. Dholl 2 CLR 12). The

possession by the defendant in the present case manifestly answers

to the description given in the definition mentioned above.

For a comparable analysis, let me refer to the South African position.

Section 1 of the Prescription Act, No. 68 of 1969 in South Africa reads as

follows: Subject to the provisions of this Chapter and of Chapter IV, a

person shall by prescription become the owner of a thing which he has

possessed openly and as if he were the owner thereof for an uninterrupted

period of thirty years or for a period which, together with any periods for

which such thing was so possessed by his predecessors in title, constitutes

an uninterrupted period of 30 years. Applying this section to the facts of

Morgenster 1711 (Pty) Ltd v. De Kock NO and Others 2012 (3) SA 59 (WCC),

decided on 05.12.2011, the High Court of South Africa stated at para 14:

The critical requirement in the present case is encapsulated in the

phrase possessed openly and as if he were the owner thereof in s

1. The possession contemplated in s 1 is so-called civil possession.

Such possession has an objective and a subjective element, namely

physical possession coupled with animus domini (see Morkels

Transport (Pty) Ltd v Melrose Foods (Pty) Ltd & Another 1972 (2) SA

464 (W) at 474B-C and cases there cited; Glaston House (Pty) Ltd v

Cape Town Municipality 1973 (4) SA 276 (C) at 281D-F; Pienaar v

Rabie 1983 (3) SA 126 (A) at 134A-D). The mental state of possessing

11

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

as if one is the owner covers both the bona fide possessor and the

mala fide possessor. This means that possession in the bona fide

but mistaken belief that one is the owner suffices (Morkels Transport

supra at 474E). The fact that the person would not have had that

state of mind if he had known the true facts (ie would not have

wished to behave as if he were the owner adversely to the true

owner) is irrelevant.

From the foregoing analysis, it should now be clear that the defendants

had, in fact, been in adverse possession since 1988, as their possession

was clearly incompatible with the plaintiffs title, and they never

acknowledged any right of the plaintiff over the disputed portion of the

land. Therefore, the argument advanced by learned counsel for the

plaintiff, that the defendants did not prove adverse possession until the

government surveyor demarcated the boundaries in 2003, must fail.

Without prejudice to the foregoing conclusion on adverse possession, I

wish to add the following for further academic discourse and judicial

determination in a suitable case in the future. According to section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance, what must be proved is undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession by a title adverse to or independent of that

of the party who holds legal title to the property for ten years preceding

the institution of the action. Notwithstanding the strong body of case law

on prescription, I could not find any authority that discusses the

independent of component in section 3. All the decided authorities

focus on the adverse to component only. I wonder whether this omission

arises from the perception that the independent of component conflicts

with the concept of prescriptive possession. It could be argued that

independent possession alone is insufficient for a successful prescriptive

claim, as it lacks the essential element of intent to exclude the true

owners rights, which is fundamental to prescription. At the argument,

12

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

although learned counsel for both parties were invited to address this

point in their post-argument written submissions, they too have not

ventured to do so. The term or is a coordinating conjunction used to

present alternatives. If I may reiterate at the cost of repetition, the

parenthetical clause, defines what is meant by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the owner: that is to say, a possession

unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of service

or duty, or by any other act by the possessor, from which an

acknowledgment of a right existing in another person would fairly and

naturally be inferred. As pointed out in Tillekeratne v. Bastian (1918) 21

NLR 12 at 17, the parenthetical clause applies to both situations

possession by a title adverse to or independent of that of the owner,

thereby identifying them as two distinct concepts. Hence, it may be

argued that the unequivocal admission of learned counsel for the

plaintiffthat exact boundaries were demarcated on the ground for the

first time in the year 2003, whereby both parties discovered for the first

time that Lot 1 of the said plan, though belonging to the plaintiff, had been

in possession of the defendantsleads to the conclusion that from the

date of the Grant on 08.08.1984 until 01.01.2003, when the government

surveyor demarcated boundaries on the ground, the defendants had been

in ut dominus possession of Lot 1 by title independent of that of the

plaintiff for over 18 years, and thereafter have continued to possess Lot

1 by title adverse to that of the plaintiff up to the present. If this

argument can be accepted, this should satisfy the requirements in

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance under the independent of

category, subject to the qualification that the institution of the action

suspends the running of prescription until the case is finally decided.

Until this point is fully argued and determined in a future case, the views

I have expressed in this paragraph may be treated as obiter dicta, without

any binding effect.

13

SC/APPEAL/132/2018

Learned counsel for the plaintiff, in the post-argument written

submissions, attempts to cast doubt on the applicability of the

Prescription Ordinance to the facts of this case. The High Court has

rightly held that there is no bar to the defendants claiming prescriptive

possession against the plaintiff. The question of law on which leave was

granted by this Court also presupposes the applicability of the

Prescription Ordinance. The plaintiff defends the judgment of the High

Court, which allowed the plaintiffs appeal. Therefore, there is no basis

for learned counsel for the plaintiff to argue that the Prescription

Ordinance does not apply in this case. The defendants are not claiming

prescriptive title against the State, but only against the plaintiff.

I answer the question of law on which leave was granted in the

affirmative. The judgment of the High Court is set aside, the judgment of

the District Court is restored, and the appeal is allowed with costs.
