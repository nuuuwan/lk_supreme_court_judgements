"","As  regards  the  second  point  pressed,  it  seems  to  me  that  the  fact"
"","that the defendant was not, at the time of his possession of the land"
"","in claim, aware that it belonged to the plaintiff, rather strengthens"
"","his claim based upon prescription. He was a bona fide possessor,"
"","and while a mala fide possessor might, just as well as a bona fide"
"","possessor, maintain a claim by prescription, it is manifest in the case"

It  has  been  argued 
that","the  possession  of  a  person"
"","possessing in the belief that the thing possessed is not the property"
"","of another is not adverse possession, and English authorities have"
"","been cited. We have nothing to do with the definition in English law"
"","of  either  the  term  “possession”  or  the  term  “adverse  possession.”"
"","Both these terms are fully discussed in the Encyclopaedia of Laws,"

"","that  there  are  points  of  essential  difference  in  what  is  laid  down"
"","there  and  our  own  conception  of  the  terms.  Possession  under  the"
"","Roman-Dutch law is either possessio civilis or possessio naturalis."
"","Possessio civilis is detentio animo domini. It is this possession that"
"","is  necessary  to  be  proved  where  a  person  seeks  either  any  of  the"
"","possessory remedies or to establish a claim by prescription. Where"
"","a person is in occupation of property in the bona fide (albeit mistake)"
"","belief that the property is his own and belongs to nobody else, clearly"
"","he has the detentio animo domini. The next question is whether his"
"","possession is adverse. As to that we have to look for guidance within"
