"although  learned  counsel  for  both  parties  were  invited  to  address  this"
"point  in  their  post-argument  written  submissions,  they  too  have  not"
"ventured to do  so. The term  “or”  is a coordinating conjunction used to"
"present  alternatives.  If  I  may  reiterate  at  the  cost  of  repetition,  the"
"parenthetical  clause,  defines  what  is  meant  by  a  title  adverse  to  or"
"independent  of 
that  of 
the  owner: 
“that 
is 
to  say,  a  possession"
"unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of service"
"or  duty,  or  by  any  other  act  by 
the  possessor, 
from  which  an"
"acknowledgment  of  a  right  existing  in  another  person  would  fairly  and"
"naturally be inferred”. As pointed out in Tillekeratne v. Bastian (1918) 21"
"NLR  12  at  17,  the  parenthetical  clause  applies  to  both  situations—"
"possession  by  a  title  adverse  to  or  independent  of  that  of  the  owner,"
"thereby  identifying  them  as  two  distinct  concepts.  Hence,  it  may  be"
"argued 
that 
the  unequivocal  admission  of 
learned  counsel 
for 
the"
"plaintiff—that “exact boundaries were demarcated on the ground for the"
"first time in the year 2003, whereby both parties discovered for the first"
"time that Lot 1 of the said plan, though belonging to the plaintiff, had been"
"in possession of the defendants”—leads to the conclusion that from the"
"date of the Grant on 08.08.1984 until 01.01.2003, when the government"
"surveyor demarcated boundaries on the ground, the defendants had been"
"in  ut  dominus  possession  of  Lot  1  “by  title  independent  of  that  of  the"
"plaintiff” for over 18 years, and thereafter have continued to possess Lot"
"1  “by  title  adverse  to  that  of  the  plaintiff”  up  to  the  present.  If  this"
"argument  can  be  accepted,  this  should  satisfy  the  requirements 
in"
"section  3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance  under  the  “independent  of”"
"category,  subject  to  the  qualification  that  the  institution  of  the  action"
"suspends  the  running  of  prescription  until  the  case  is  finally  decided."
"Until this point is fully argued and determined in a future case, the views"
"I have expressed in this paragraph may be treated as obiter dicta, without"
"any binding effect."
