"10 
 SC/APPEAL/132/2018"
"the  four  corners  of  our  own  Ordinance  relating  to  prescription  of"
"actions. The words in section 3—“A possession unaccompanied by"
"payment of rent or produce or performance of service or duty or by"
"any other act by the possessor from which an acknowledgment of a"
"right  existing 
in  another  person  would  fairly  and  naturally  be"
"inferred”—have been held by this Court to contain not an illustration,"
"but a definition of “adverse possession” (see Daniel v. Markar Ram."
"1843-55,  2,  Vand.  Rep.  44,  Carrim  v.  Dholl  2  CLR  12).  The"
"possession by the defendant in the present case manifestly answers"
"to the description given in the definition mentioned above."
