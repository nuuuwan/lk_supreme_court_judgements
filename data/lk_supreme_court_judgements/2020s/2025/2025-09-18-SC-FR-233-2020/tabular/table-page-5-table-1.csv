"The villagers had filed a complaint at the Kiriella Police Station following this demolition,"
"upon which the Petitioner was requested to present himself at the Kiriella Police Station"
"for an inquiry. However, the Petitioner had informed the 1st Respondent that the land in"
"question fell within the Eheliyagoda Police division, whereupon the 1st Respondent had"
"taken necessary steps to refer the matter to the Eheliyagoda Police Station. However, the"
"1st Respondent was displeased that the Petitioner did not present himself at the Kiriella"
"Police Station."
"In  2019,  the  said  Seneviratne,  along  with  some  other  villagers  again  tried  to  build  a"
"foundation on the land.  Upon  becoming aware of this, the Petitioner had immediately"
"filed a complaint with the Eheliyagoda Police. During the inquiry into this complaint, the"
"Eheliyagoda Police could not find any evidence to support the claim and/or  title of the"
"villagers to the land. Thereafter, the Divisional Secretary also verified the ownership of the"
"Petitioner and his wife to the said land. Later, an illicit electricity connection to the shrine"
"obtained by the villagers was transferred back to the Petitioner’s wife’s name."
"On 25.02.2020, when the Petitioner and four others tried to conduct a Bhairava Poojawa"
"on the said land, the villagers had verbally abused them while levelling accusations that"
"they were attempting to excavate antiquities, and purportedly made phone calls to the"
"Kiriella Police Station."
"Since  the  abuse  was  becoming  intense,  and  as  the  Kiriella  Police  Station  was  closer  in"
"proximity, the Petitioner too had made phone calls to the Kiriella Police Station. He was"
"then advised to remain at the location. Later, officers of the Kiriella Police Station (4th to"
"6th  Respondents)  had  arrived  at  the  location  at  which  point  the  villagers  had  started"
"physically assaulting the Petitioner and those with him. The 1st Respondent also arrived at"
"the location."
