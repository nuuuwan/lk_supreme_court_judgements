"According to Dokras [Dr. Uday Dokras, Vajrayāna Shiva Bhairava worship in “India” and"
"Indonesia1],  Bhairava  (Sanskrit:  भैरव  lit. 'frightful')  or  Kala  Bhairava  is  a  Shaivite  and"
"Vajrayāna  deity  worshipped  by  Hindus  and  Buddhists.  In  Shaivism,  he  is  a  powerful"
"manifestation,  or  avatar,  of  Shiva  associated  with  annihilation. 
In  the  Trika  system"
"Bhairava  represents  the  Supreme  Reality,  synonymous  to  Para  Brahman.  Generally,  in"
"Hinduism, Bhairava is also called Dandapani (""[he who holds the] Danda in [his] hand""),"
"as he holds a rod or Danda to punish sinners, and Svaśva, meaning ""whose vehicle is a"
"dog"". 
In  Vajrayana  Buddhism,  he 
is  considered  a  fierce  emanation  of  Boddhisatva"
"Mañjuśrī,  and  also  called  Heruka,  Vajrabhairava,  and  Yamantaka.  He 
is  worshipped"
"throughout India, Nepal and Sri Lanka as well as in Tibetan Buddhism."
"There is symbolic evidence that Bhairava is considered to be associated with warding off"
"evil spirits. The rectangular blocks of stone which stand on each side of the steps at the"
"entrance  to  ancient  Buddhist  shrines  in  Sri  Lanka  are  known  as  Guardstones.  Many  of"
"these Guardstones have Bhairava upon their faces."
"Nevertheless, it is widely known that Bhairava Pooja is also performed prior to excavation"
"for treasure. In this context, the reasonable suspicion the 1st Respondent claims to have"
"entertained may be justified."
"However,  when  other  circumstances  associated  with 
the 
incident  are 
taken 
into"
"consideration,  this  justification  disappears.  In  particular,  the  allegation  made  by  the"
"Petitioner  that  the  1st  Respondent  carried  out  the  arrest  and  produced  the  Petitioner"
"before the Magistrates Court of Ratnapura with malice is substantiated."
