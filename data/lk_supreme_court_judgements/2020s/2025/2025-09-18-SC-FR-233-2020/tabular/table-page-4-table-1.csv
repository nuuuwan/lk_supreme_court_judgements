"The Petitioner claims that his arrest is unlawful. Leave to proceed has been granted under"
"Articles 12(1) and 13(1) of the Constitution."
"Version of the Petitioner"
"The  father-in-law  of  the  Petitioner  is  well-known  in  the  Kiriella  village  and  had  been  a"
"Justice  of  the  Peace,  President  of  the  Village  Council  and  Treasurer  of  the  Funeral  Aid"
"Society. He was also a renowned landed proprietor."
"The Petitioner’s wife inherited various properties from her father including a land named"
"Galapallahena situated in the Hindurangala Grama Niladhari division containing 6 acres in"
"extent."
"There is a small area of about 2 perches of that land which was used by the Petitioner and"
"his wife whenever they visited the land. Although this land was situated in Kiriella, it fell"
"within the police division assigned to Eheliyagoda Police Station, and not Kiriella Police"
"Station."
"A conflict began when a neighbour, T.A. Seneviratne, first obtained permission to light oil"
"lamps on the property from the Petitioner’s father-in-law. In or around 2012, while the"
"Petitioner’s  father-in-law  was 
in  hospital,  Seneviratne  and  other  villagers  unlawfully"
"constructed a Buddhist shrine on the land. The owners, viewing it as a meritorious act,"
"initially did not object to it."
"In 2018, when Seneviratne attempted to expand the construction to add a lavatory and a"
"room for a priest, the Petitioner strongly objected.  Upon the Petitioner's complaint, the"
"Grama  Niladhari  officially  verified  the  wife's  ownership  to  the  land  and  declared  the"
"structures  to  be 
illegal.  Thereafter,  steps  were  taken  to  demolish  the  unauthorized"
"constructions  except  the  shrine  room  after  the  Petitioner  made  a  complaint  at  the"
"Eheliyagoda Police Station."
