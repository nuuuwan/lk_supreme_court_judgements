Samayawardhena, J.

The two plaintiffs have instituted this action against the three defendants

in the District Court of Nugegoda, seeking, inter alia, declarations that: (i)

the 1st plaintiff is the owner of the land described in the 3rd schedule to the

plaint, subject to the life interest of the 2nd plaintiff; (ii) the 2nd defendant

holds the property in trust for the plaintiffs; (iii) the 2nd defendant had no

authority to transfer the property to the 1st defendant by Deed marked P11;

and (iv) the 1st defendant had no right to lease the property to the 3rd

defendant by Deed marked P12.

The case proceeded ex parte against the 2nd and 3rd defendants. Only the

1st defendant, Ceylinco Securities and Financial Services Ltd., contested the

3

SC/APPEAL/191/2018

plaintiffs action. In its answer, the 1st defendant sought a dismissal of the

action.

After trial, the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs action. On appeal, the

High Court of Civil Appeal of Mount Lavinia allowed the plaintiffs appeal.

Hence, this appeal by the 1st defendant. This Court granted leave to appeal

on the following questions of law:

(a) Did the High Court err in holding that the transfer of the land by the

plaintiffs to the 2nd defendant by Deed marked P9 was merely as

security for a loan granted by the 2nd defendant to the plaintiffs?

(b) Did the High Court fail to consider that the 1st defendant is a bona

fide purchaser?

(c) Did the High Court fail to consider that the rights of a bona fide

purchaser of land are unaffected by the existence of a constructive

trust?

As the 2nd defendant did not challenge the plaintiffs evidence that Deed

marked P9 was not an outright transfer but was executed as security for a

loan transaction, which loan was repaid as evidenced by P10, the finding of

the High Court that the 2nd defendant was holding the property in trust for

the plaintiffs cannot be faulted. This finding was not vigorously challenged

by learned counsel for the 1st defendant at the hearing.

The main ground on which the appeal was argued by learned counsel for

the 1st defendant is that, even if a constructive trust could be presumed,

the 1st defendants rights as a bona fide purchaser are unaffected by virtue

of section 98 of the Trusts Ordinance.

Section 98 of the Trusts Ordinance reads as follows:

4

SC/APPEAL/191/2018

Nothing contained in this Chapter shall impair the rights of transferees

in good faith for valuable consideration, or create an obligation in

evasion of any law for the time being in force.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the plaintiffs contended that this was a

novel argument raised for the first time before the Supreme Court. However,

learned counsel for the 1st defendant countered this by drawing the

attention of the Court to issue No. 9 raised by the 1st defendant at the trial.

Issue No. 9 and the corresponding answer given by the trial Judge read as

follows:

9() 1

1 .

() 1 ?

09 () .

The issue raised by the 1st defendant as to whether it is a bona fide

purchaser under Deed P11 was not answered in the affirmative by the

District Court.

The involvement of the 1st defendant in this transaction appears to be

dubious. According to the written submissions filed on behalf of the 1st

defendant, its position is that the 3rd defendant approached the 1st

defendant and requested that the property be purchased on his behalf, with

an arrangement allowing the 3rd defendant to repurchase or reacquire the

property through a lease-back agreement. It is further stated that

although the lease agreement marked P12 was executed, the 3rd defendant

failed to honour his obligations under the lease and defaulted in making

5

SC/APPEAL/191/2018

payments. This arrangement is difficult to understand without any

assistance from recorded evidence.

At the trial, on behalf of the 1st defendant company, only an officer of the

company and an assessor gave evidence. Neither of these witnesses was

able to offer clear testimony regarding the exact details of the aforesaid

transaction. The assessors role was limited to valuing the land. The officer

of the 1st defendant company, however, gave evidence that contradicted the

position taken by the 1st defendant in its written submissions. In his

evidence he stated as follows:

: 2 1

?

: . 3

Deeds P11 and P12 were marked by the 1st plaintiff in the course of his

evidence in order to fully present the plaintiffs case. However, this should

not be construed as an acknowledgment of the validity of the transactions

reflected therein. The plaintiffs maintain that these documents are invalid

and ought to be declared null and void.

None of the attesting witnesses to P11the vendor, vendee, subscribing

witnesses, or notarywas called to give evidence. The officer of the 1st

defendant who testified admitted that the notary and the two subscribing

witnesses were employees of the 1st defendant company.

SC/APPEAL/191/2018

In the attestation, the notary states that the vendor was unknown to him,

but that the subscribing witnesses were known to him. However, the notary

does not state that the vendor was known to the subscribing witnesses.

More importantly, in the attestation, the notary in a separate paragraph

further states that I further certify and attest that the consideration herein

mentioned was not paid in my presence. He does not state that the vendor

and/or vendee claimed the consideration was paid previously. There is no

evidence before Court that the 1st defendant purchased the property for

valuable consideration. None of the witnesses gave any evidence regarding

the consideration.

In accordance with section 98 of the Trusts Ordinance, the rights of

transferees in good faith for valuable consideration remain unaffected.

However, upon reviewing the evidence, I am not satisfied that the conditions

of good faith and valuable consideration have been established to the

satisfaction of the Court. Therefore, the 1st defendants claim to protection

under section 98 of the Trusts Ordinance cannot be upheld.

I answer the questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted in the

negative. The appeal is dismissed but without costs.
