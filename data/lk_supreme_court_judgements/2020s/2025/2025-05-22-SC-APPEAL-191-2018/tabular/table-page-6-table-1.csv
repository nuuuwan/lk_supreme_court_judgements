"In the attestation, the notary states that the vendor  was unknown to him,"
"but that the subscribing witnesses were known to him. However, the notary"
"does not state that the vendor was known to the subscribing witnesses."
"More  importantly, in  the  attestation, the  notary  in  a  separate  paragraph"
"further states that “I further certify and attest that the consideration herein"
"mentioned was not paid in my presence.” He does not state that the vendor"
"and/or vendee  claimed the consideration  was paid previously.  There  is no"
"evidence  before  Court  that  the  1st  defendant  purchased  the  property  for"
"valuable consideration.  None of the witnesses  gave any evidence  regarding"
"the consideration."
"In  accordance  with  section  98  of  the  Trusts  Ordinance, 
“the  rights  of"
"transferees  in  good  faith  for  valuable  consideration”  remain  unaffected."
"However, upon reviewing the evidence, I am not satisfied that the conditions"
"of  good  faith  and  valuable  consideration  have  been  established 
to  the"
"satisfaction of the Court. Therefore,  the 1st defendant’s  claim to protection"
"under section 98 of the Trusts Ordinance cannot be upheld."
"I answer the questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted in the"
"negative. The appeal is dismissed  but without costs."
