"“To  succeed  with 
the  rei  vindica(cid:415)o,","the  owner  must  prove  on  a  balance  of"
"","probabili(cid:415)es, ﬁrst, his or her ownership in the property. If a movable is sought to be"
"","recovered, the owner must rebut the presump(cid:415)on that the possessor of the movable"
"","is the owner thereof. In the case of immovables, it is suﬃcient as a rule to show that"
"","(cid:415)tle in the land is registered in his or her name. Secondly, the property must exist,"
"","be clearly iden(cid:415)ﬁable and must not have been destroyed or consumed. Money, in"
"the  form  of  coins  and  banknotes,  is  not  easily","iden(cid:415)ﬁable  and  thus  not  easily"
"","vindicable. Thirdly, the defendant must be in possession or deten(cid:415)on of the thing at"
"","the moment the ac(cid:415)on is ins(cid:415)tuted. The ra(cid:415)onale is to ensure that the defendant is"
"in a posi(cid:415)on to comply with an order for restora(cid:415)on.” [emphasis added]",""
