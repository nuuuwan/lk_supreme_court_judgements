"Thus, the Defendant very clearly stated that the land which is the subject ma(cid:425)er of this"
"case had been given to her father on a permit and that at the invita(cid:415)on of her father, she"
"occupied part of the land. With there being no evidence that Ebrahim Samsudeen had"
"been  given  another  permit  by  the  State,  it  is  clear  that  Lot  ‘B’  in  P2  occupied  by  the"
"Defendant forms part of the land referred to in P1. Thus, the Defendant herself had no"
"issue with regard to the iden(cid:415)ty of the land from which her ejec(cid:415)on was sought."
