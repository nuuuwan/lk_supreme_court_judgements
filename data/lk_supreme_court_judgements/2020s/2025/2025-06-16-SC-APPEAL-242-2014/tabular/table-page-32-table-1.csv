"merasinghe,  J  stated  in  Dona  Podi  Nona  Ranaweera  Menike  v  Rohini  Senanayake"
"[(1992) 2 Sri LR 180; at page 191] that:"
"“A ma(cid:425)er that has not been raised before might, nevertheless, be a ground of appeal"
"on which an appellate court might base its decision, provided it is a pure ques(cid:415)on"
"of law; or, if the point might have been put forward in the court below under one"
"of the issues raised, and the court is sa(cid:415)sﬁed (1) that it has before it all the facts"
"bearing upon the new conten(cid:415)on, as completely as would have been the case if the"
"controversy  had  arisen  at  the  trial,  and  (2)  that  no  sa(cid:415)sfactory  explana(cid:415)on  could"
"have  been  oﬀered  by  the  other  side,  if  an  opportunity  had  been  aﬀorded  it,  of"
"adducing evidence with regard to the point raised for the ﬁrst (cid:415)me in appeal. The"
"opinion expressed on this ma(cid:425)er by Lord Herschell in The Tasmania [(1890) 15 App."
"Cas. 223] has consistently formed the basis of our law on this ques(cid:415)on… Therefore,"
"the ques(cid:415)on before us is not, with great respect, as it appears to have been supposed"
"in Jayawickrama v David Silva [76 NLR 427], and by the Court of Appeal in this case,"
"and by learned counsel in the ma(cid:425)er before us, to be one depending simply on the"
"issue whether the new point raised was one of law, on the one hand, or a ques(cid:415)on"
"of fact or a mixed ques(cid:415)on of law and fact, on the other.” [emphasis added]"
