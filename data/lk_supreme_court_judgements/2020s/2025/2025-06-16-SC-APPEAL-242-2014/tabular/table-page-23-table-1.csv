"Appeal No. 49/2012; SC minutes of 27th March 2015] where Eva Wanasundara, J stated as"
"follows:"
"“The par(cid:415)es to the ac(cid:415)on in the District  Court are the par(cid:415)es to the ac(cid:415)on in the"
"appellate court, in this instance the High Court of Civil Appeals. The pe(cid:415)(cid:415)on of appeal"
"had not contained in the cap(cid:415)on, the names of the subs(cid:415)tuted par(cid:415)es. I feel that, the"
"mere  fact  that  only  the  name  of  the  dead  person  was  men(cid:415)oned  in  the  cap(cid:415)on,"
"cannot be held against the party seeking relief from Court. It is a lapse on the part of"
"the pe(cid:415)(cid:415)oner’s A(cid:425)orney-at-Law. The li(cid:415)gant who has come before Court for relief"
"should not be deprived of his right to seek relief due to a lapse on the part of the"
"lawyers preparing and ﬁling the papers. In the case in hand, the dead person had"
"been subs(cid:415)tuted promptly in the District Court and named as 1A and 1B defendants."
"It is only a lapse of not wri(cid:415)ng down the cap(cid:415)on properly. I am of the view that this"
"is a ma(cid:425)er which should have been corrected by the High Court Judges …. It is not"
"an incorrigible defect, good enough for rejec(cid:415)ng the pe(cid:415)(cid:415)on of appeal.”[emphasis"

"no(cid:415)ce  of  appeal  as  well  as  to  the  pe(cid:415)(cid:415)on  of  appeal  could  only  be  construed  as"
"negligence  and  not  as  a  mistake  or  inadvertence  on  the  part  of  the  defendants-"
"appellants and their A(cid:425)orney-at-Law. Such negligence in my opinion should not be"
"condoned or in any manner encouraged. If not, it would be opening the ﬂood gates"
