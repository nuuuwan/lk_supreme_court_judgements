"Abeysinghe  v  Abeysekara  [(1995)  2  Sri  LR  104;  at  page  106]  was  a  case  where  the"
"defendant had died prior to the ins(cid:415)tu(cid:415)on of ac(cid:415)on. Ranaraja, J in the Court of Appeal"
"held that:"
"“An ac(cid:415)on ﬁled against a sole defendant who was dead at the (cid:415)me is a nullity, and"
"any subs(cid:415)tu(cid:415)on of his legal representa(cid:415)ve therea(cid:332)er is also a nullity. The reason is"
"that the ac(cid:415)on is not merely against a wrong person but against no person at all,"
"and when the subs(cid:415)tu(cid:415)on of his legal representa(cid:415)ve is made it is not really a case of"
"subs(cid:415)tu(cid:415)on but rather the ﬁling of a new ac(cid:415)on against a new defendant."
