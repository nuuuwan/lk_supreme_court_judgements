"Chief Jus(cid:415)ce Wood Renton held as follows:"
"“In  case  No. 359 the ﬁrst defendant  was, in  my  opinion, a  necessary party to  the"
"appeal, as the share allo(cid:425)ed to him in the plaint might be prejudicially aﬀected by"
"the  result  of  the  inquiry  into  the  intervenients'  claims.  But  the  ques(cid:415)on  remains"
"whether, as a ma(cid:425)er of discre(cid:415)on, we ought not to allow his name to be added under"
"sec(cid:415)on  770  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  I  have  no  doubt  as  to  the  power  of  the"
"Supreme Court  to dismiss an  appeal, on  the ground that  it  has not  been  properly"
"cons(cid:415)tuted by the necessary par(cid:415)es being made respondents to it, and I am equally"
"clear that that power should be exercised, unless the defect is not one of an obvious"
"character,  which  could  not  reasonably  have  been  foreseen  and  avoided.”  [page"
