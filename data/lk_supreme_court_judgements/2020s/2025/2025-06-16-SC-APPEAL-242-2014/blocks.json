No\u019fces however had been issued by the Civil Appellate High Court of the Uva Province holden in Badulla [the High Court] to all Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s. The appeal had accordingly proceeded before the High Court with the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s represented by an A\u01a9orney-at-Law who incidentally was the holder of the proxy of the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s before the District Court.

Pursuant to leave being granted, an applica\u019fon had been made by learned Counsel that this ma\u01a9er be referred to a divisional bench of this Court since con\ufb02ic\u019fng views have been expressed by this Court with regard to the \ufb01rst, and more par\u019fcularly the second ques\u019fon of law. Accordingly, His Lordship the Chief Jus\u019fce had made an order on 7th June 2023 in terms of Ar\u019fcle 132(3) of the Cons\u019ftu\u019fon cons\u019ftu\u019fng a bench of seven Judges of this Court to hear and determine this ma\u01a9er.

The submissions of the learned Counsel for the 1C Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00 re\ufb02ects the above three components. He submi\u01a9ed that the appeal to the High Court has been preferred against a party who had passed away at the \u019fme the appeal was \ufb01led and thus, the appeal has been preferred against a non-existent person. He submi\u01a9ed that what followed therea\u014cer was a complete nullity, and that the judgment of the High Court must be set aside on that ground alone. In support of his submission, the learned Counsel for the 1C Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00 has cited several decisions of this Court and of the Court of Appeal.",

This fact dis\u019fnguishes each of the said cases cited by the learned Counsel for the 1C Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00 from this case. Thus, what transformed into the appeal before the High Court was the said District Court ac\u019fon of which the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s were already par\u019fes and hence, this was not a case where there was a necessity to subs\u019ftute the Plain\u019f\ufb00 afresh in the High Court prior to the delivery of the judgment of the High Court. I should perhaps start with the judgment of this Court in Jeyaraj Fernandopulle v Premachandra De Silva and others [(1996) 1 Sri LR 70]. The issue that arose was whether a Court, and speci\ufb01cally the Supreme Court, can be called upon to review or revise a ma\u01a9er once that ma\u01a9er has been decided. In the course of his judgment, Amerasinghe, J stated that:",

The reason is that the ac\u019fon is not merely against a wrong person but against no person at all, and when the subs\u019ftu\u019fon of his legal representa\u019fve is made it is not really a case of subs\u019ftu\u019fon but rather the \ufb01ling of a new ac\u019fon against a new defendant. An ac\u019fon which is a nullity cannot receive ra\u019f\ufb01ca\u019fon such as would retroac\u019fvely render it valid from its commencement. The proceedings in the ac\u019fon have the e\ufb00ect of not having taken place at all. Hence the decree and the writ issued on the basis of that decree will be a nullity.\u201d It is in the above context that the Court of Appeal held at page 108 that, \u201cWhen there is no live defendant before Court, the Court has no jurisdic\u019fon to hear and determine the ac\u019fon. If the Court has no jurisdic\u019fon, it is of no consequence that the proceedings had been formally conducted, for they are coram non judice. A judgment entered by such Court is void and mere nullity.\u201d A situa\u019fon similar to that in Abeysinghe arose in Bengamuwa Dhammaloka Thero v Dr. Cyril Anton Balasuriya [(2010) 1 Sri LR 193] where the 2nd defendant had passed away prior to the ins\u019ftu\u019fon of ac\u019fon in the District Court. This Court a\ufb03rmed the decision of the Court of Appeal that the decree entered in the case against the 2nd defendant was void. In Darley Butler and Company Limited v Anoos and others [(2008) 2 Sri LR 149] a mortgage bond ac\u019fon was ins\u019ftuted seeking judgment against four defendants jointly and severally. The 2nd defendant in his answer contended that, due to the death of the 4th defendant prior to the ins\u019ftu\u019fon of the ac\u019fon, the ac\u019fon become invalid in law and is null and void and ac\u019fon cannot be maintained even against the 2nd defendant. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument and held [at pages 151 - 153] that while the \u201cSitua\u019fon would have been en\u019frely di\ufb00erent if it was a suit against a sole defendant since the suit \ufb01led against a sole defendant who was dead is a nullity.\u201d \u2026 \u201cSince this is a case where the",

Here, the 7th defendant had died prior to the trial commencing but no steps had been taken to subs\u019ftute the 7th defendant.

However, the facts of this case are di\ufb00erent from the factual situa\u019fons that have arisen in each of the above cases. While the situa\u019fons in (a), (b) and (f) do not apply to this case, the situa\u019fons in (d) and (e) too does not arise by virtue of the Plain\u019f\ufb00 in this case being alive at the \u019fme of the ins\u019ftu\u019fon of ac\u019fon and having been subs\u019ftuted in the District Court prior to such Court delivering its judgment. The cri\u019fcal point in this case is that the record was not defec\u019fve, either at the \u019fme of delivery of the judgment of the District Court or at the \u019fme the appeal was \ufb01led in the High Court, as a result of the Plain\u019f\ufb00 having been subs\u019ftuted. The only issue is whether there was a \u201clive party\u201d before the High Court. In this regard, I must reiterate that the Plain\u019f\ufb00 was subs\u019ftuted before the District Court with the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s and for all intents and purposes the proper party to the appeal could only have been the said Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s and not the deceased Plain\u019f\ufb00. In other words, the \u201clive party\u201d in this case are the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s. The fact that the no\u019fce of appeal and the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal does not refer to the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s but instead refers only to the deceased Plain\u019f\ufb00 does not, in my view, mean that the appeal was prosecuted against the deceased Plain\u019f\ufb00 for the reason that the deceased Plain\u019f\ufb00 had been subs\u019ftuted by then. I must reiterate that the only \u201clive party\u201d at the \u019fme the appeal was \ufb01led in the High Court were the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s, which then leads me to the second ques\u019fon of law, that being whether the failure to name the \u201clive party\u201d in the no\u019fce of appeal and the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal is curable in terms of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code or whether such a defect was fatal to the maintainability of the appeal before the High Court, thereby rendering the en\u019fre appeal of the Defendant defec\u019fve and vi\u019fa\u019fng the judgment of the High Court.",

Sec\u019fon 759(2) provides that, \u201cIn the case of any mistake, omission or defect on the part of any appellant in complying with the provisions of the foregoing sec\u019fons, the Court of Appeal may, if it should be of opinion that the respondent has not been materially prejudiced, grant relief on such terms as it may deem just.\u201d Nanayakkara v Warnakulasuriya [(1993) 2 Sri LR 289] was a case where the Court of Appeal had dismissed the defendant's appeal on a preliminary objec\u019fon that he had failed to hypothecate the sum of Rs. 150 deposited as security for the respondent's costs of appeal. Kulatunga, J stated that, \u201cThe power of the Court to grant relief under sec\u019fon 759(2) of the Code is wide and discre\u019fonary and is subject to such terms as the Court may deem just. Relief may be granted even if no excuse for non-compliance is forthcoming. However, relief cannot be granted if the Court is of the opinion that the respondent has been materially prejudiced in which event the appeal has to be dismissed.\u201d In Somaratne v Dharmasena and others [SC Appeal No. 29/2014; SC minutes of 6th April 2023], this Court considered whether the failure to name a party in the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal can be cured under Sec\u019fon 759(2). While there were eight defendants, that being a par\u019f\u019fon case the only contes\u019fng defendant was the 4th defendant. The District Court allo\u01a9ed shares to all par\u019fes. Aggrieved, the 4th defendant appealed to the High Court but did not name the other defendants as par\u019fes to the appeal. An objec\u019fon taken that the necessary par\u019fes were not before the High Court was upheld by the High Court. In an appeal to this Court, it was sought to be argued that the failure to name the other defendants caused no material prejudice to those defendants who had not been named as they had not par\u019fcipated in the trial.",

When a necessary party has not been made a respondent, this sec\u019fon has no applicability. I am aware that relief has been granted for failure to make necessary par\u019fes as par\u019fes to the appeal under sec\u019fon 759(2) on the basis that no material prejudice has been caused by such failure. This seems to me not to be correct. The ques\u019fon is not whether prejudice has been caused to the named respondents by not naming necessary par\u019fes as respondents, which, to my mind, is meaningless. If that interpreta\u019fon is given, the appellant can name only par\u019fes who support him as respondents and say no prejudice has been caused to them by the failure to name other par\u019fes as respondents.\u201d [emphasis added] I am in agreement with the view taken in Somaratne that Sec\u019fon 759(2) does not provide a solu\u019fon to the situa\u019fon that has arisen in this appeal. It however begs the ques\u019fon whether the failure to name the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s is a mistake that cannot be cured at all in terms of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.

    "text": "\u201cIn the instant appeal, I would hold that the default of ci\u019fng a person not living as the respondent in the no\u019fce of appeal and the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal which resulted from the negligence of the defendants-appellants and the registered A\u01a9orney-at-Law would render the no\u019fce of appeal and the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal void ab ini\u019fo and liable to be rejected in limine. This defect being incurable the defendants-appellants cannot seek any relief in terms of sec\u019fon 759(2) of the Civil Procedure Code to amend the cap\u019fon to bring in the person who should have been made respondent to the no\u019fce of appeal and the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal.\u201d [page 336] Referring to the above passage, Samayawardhena, J stated in Somaratne v Dharmasena [supra], that the decision in Wimalasiri \u201ccannot be treated as good law in view of the Supreme Court judgment in Nanayakkara v. Warnakulasuriya [1993] 2 Sri LR 289 at 293, where Kulatunga J. held \u201cIn an applica\u019fon for relief under sec\u019fon 759(2), the rule that the negligence of the A\u01a9orney-at-Law is the negligence of the client does not apply as in the cases of default curable under Sec\u019fons 86(2), 87(3) and 771. Such negligence may be relevant but it does not fe\u01a9er the discre\u019fon of the Court to grant relief where it is just and fair to do so.\u201d In any event, in Wimalasiri v. Premasiri the Court of Appeal did not consider the applicability of sec\u019fon 770 at all.\u201d [emphasis added] I must also refer to the judgment of this Court in Amarawathie and others v Perera [SC Spl LA No. 198/2011; SC minutes of 10th December 2014]. In that case, the 5th defendant \u2013 respondent \u2013 pe\u019f\u019foner had passed away while the appeal was pending before the Court of Appeal and he had been subs\u019ftuted. Judgment of the Court of Appeal had been delivered therea\u014cer. Similar to this case, the cap\u019fon in the judgment however contained the name of the deceased 5th defendant, and the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal had followed the cap\u019fon in the judgment. An objec\u019fon was taken that naming a dead person as a pe\u019f\u019foner is a defect that cannot be cured and renders the pe\u019f\u019fon, as opposed to the judgment, a nullity. Dep, J [as he was then] stated that, \u201cIn the case before us the ini\u019fal mistake was done by the Court of Appeal by including in the judgment the name of the 5th Defendant Respondent who is dead. Pe\u019f\u019foners had followed the same cap\u019fon in the Applica\u019fon. I am of the view that the remaining Pe\u019f\u019foners should not be non suited on account of this",

    "text": "\u201cThe ques\u019fon that arises in this case is when the Court of Appeal by mistake or due to inadvertence included a deceased party in the cap\u019fon, could a pe\u019f\u019foner on their own without following the same cap\u019fon rec\u019ffy the mistake. The proper course of ac\u019fon appears to be that the pe\u019f\u019foner should have moved the Court of Appeal to rec\u019ffy the error in the \ufb01rst instance or use the same cap\u019fon and seek permission of this court to subs\u019ftute or to delete the name of the deceased person and include the subs\u019ftuted party. The Pe\u019f\u019foners belatedly followed the second course to amend the cap\u019fon by adding the subs\u019ftuted 5th Defendant-Respondent-Pe\u019f\u019foner.\u201d Thus, I am of the view that the failure to name the \u201clive party\u201d in the no\u019fce of appeal and the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal is a defect that can be cured in terms of Sec\u019fon 770 of the Civil Procedure Code. It was the responsibility of the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s to have raised this ma\u01a9er before the High Court, which admi\u01a9edly they did not do. One cannot fault the High Court, especially since the cap\u019fon in the judgment of the District Court only contained the name of the Plain\u019f\ufb00. The 1C Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00 has not complained in the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal to this Court that the failure to name him and the other Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s as par\u019fes has deprived them of a hearing before the High Court or prejudiced them in any manner. However, since this issue has now been raised in the \ufb01rst two ques\u019fons of law, I shall consider if this was a \ufb01t case where the High Court ought to have exercised their discre\u019fon vested in terms of Sec\u019fon 770 and allowed the Defendant to amend the cap\u019fon, had an objec\u019fon been taken before the High Court. The Defendant has not given any speci\ufb01c reason for the defect, probably due to the fact that an opportunity to do so did not arise in the High Court. However, the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Defendant drew our a\u01a9en\u019fon to the following ma\u01a9ers: (a) The Journal Entry of the High Court of 4th November 2008 which reads as follows: \u201c\u0d85\u0234\u0dba\u0dcf\u0da0\u0db1\u0dcf \u0dd9\u0d9c\u0dcf\u01e9 \u0dc3\u0d9a\u0dc3\u0dca \u00fb\u025d\u0dd9\u023c \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dca\u01b1 \u0d9a\u0dd0\u0db3\u0dc0\u0dcf \u0dd9\u023c\u0db8 \u0db1\u018d\u0dd9\u0269 \u0db4\u0dd0\u023d\u019d\u0263\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb \u0dc0\u0d9c\u0d8b\u01ae\u0dad\u0dbb\u0d9a\u025e\u0dc0\u01e6 \u0dc3\u0dc4",

Accordingly, with the death of Samsudeen, the name of the Plain\u019f\ufb00 had been entered as the permit holder in 1987. Thus, on the face of it, the Plain\u019f\ufb00 had \u019ftle to the land referred to in the First Schedule to the plaint and with the land referred to in the Second Schedule to the plaint being part of the First Schedule, to the land in the Second Schedule, as well.",

    "text": "It was the posi\u019fon of the Plain\u019f\ufb00 that he allowed the Defendant to temporarily occupy part of the said land referred to in P1, in extent of \u00bd rood, morefully set out in the Second Schedule to the plaint together with a building situated thereon, but that the Defendant had refused to vacate the said land occupied by her. Although the land from which ejectment of the Defendant was sought was iden\u019f\ufb01ed by reference to P1, the First Schedule to the plaint did not contain the boundaries of the land referred to in P1 for the reason that P1 too does not refer to the boundaries of Lot No. 197. However, it goes without saying that the boundaries of the land would have been ascertainable from the FVP. In her answer, the Defendant had admi\u01a9ed the residence of both par\u019fes but denied the rest of the averments of the plaint. While claiming compensa\u019fon for the improvements e\ufb00ected by her, the Defendant had pleaded that the plaint is not in conformity with the provisions of Sec\u019fon 41 of the Civil Procedure Code which provides that, \u201cwhen the claim made in the ac\u019fon is for some speci\ufb01c por\u019fon of land, or for some share or interest in a speci\ufb01c por\u019fon of land, then the por\u019fon of land must be described in the plaint so far as possible by reference to physical metes and bounds, or by reference to a su\ufb03cient sketch, map or plan to be appended to the plaint, and not by name only.\u201d Issue No. 7 raised by the Defendant was whether the plaint is contrary to the provisions of Sec\u019fon 41. I must say that the land in the First Schedule was referred to by a FVP and that, in my view, was su\ufb03cient compliance for the purposes of Sec\u019fon 41. In any event, P2 had su\ufb03ciently iden\u019f\ufb01ed the land in dispute. Commission issued by the District Court A\u014cer the pleadings were completed, the Plain\u019f\ufb00 sought a commission to survey Lot No. 197 in FVP No. 189. The survey had accordingly been carried out on 15th September 1994 by P.W. Nandasena, Licensed Surveyor. Plan No. 623 [P2] prepared by the Surveyor pursuant to such survey consists of Lot \u2018A\u2019 occupied by the Plain\u019f\ufb00 and Lot \u2018B\u2019 occupied by the Defendant. Thus, the boundaries of the land occupied by the Defendant have been clearly iden\u019f\ufb01ed in P2, and with the Defendant having admi\u01a9ed the residence of both par\u019fes and that she is occupying the land given to her by her father, there could not have been any doubt with regard to the iden\u019fty of the land from which ejectment of the Defendant was sought.",

Thus, the surveyor was being honest when he answered the \ufb01nal ques\u019fon. The evidence of the Surveyor is that a\u014cer super imposi\u019fon, it was evident that both lots 197 and 336 are the same. If the Defendant was of the view that (a) the Plain\u019f\ufb00 had \u019ftle to Lot No. 197 by virtue of P1 and not to Lot No. 336, or (b) the land in P1 is not the land that is occupied by the Defendant, or any other issue rela\u019fng to the iden\u019fty of the corpus, the Defendant ought to have raised an issue even at this stage. The Defendant did not do so nor did the Defendant raise this ma\u01a9er in the wri\u01a9en submissions tendered on her behalf to the District Court. Thus, I am of the view that the Plain\u019f\ufb00 had discharged the burden cast on a plain\u019f\ufb00 in a rei vindica\u019fo ac\u019fon. As pointed out by Chief Jus\u019fce Dep in Preethi Anura v William Silva [SC Appeal No. 116/2014; SC Minutes of 5th June 2017], a plain\u019f\ufb00 in a rei vindica\u019fo ac\u019fon \u201cneed not establish the \u019ftle with mathema\u019fcal precision nor to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt as in a criminal case. The plain\u019f\ufb00\u2019s task is to establish the case on a balance of probability.\u201d Evidence of the Defendant The fact that the land which was the subject ma\u01a9er of the case was given to her father by P1 was con\ufb01rmed by the evidence of the Defendant herself.

    "text": "\u201cThe said surveyor in his tes\u019fmony has clearly admi\u01a9ed that he has surveyed the land which was not described in the commission issued to him. The plan has been marked as P2 and in that the surveyor has clearly stated that he has surveyed Lot number 336 in FVP 189 whereas the commission issued to him ordering to survey lot number 197 in the same FVP. The subs\u019ftuted 1C Plain\u019f\ufb00 too has admi\u01a9ed the same fact in his evidence in the trial [in page 98 of the appeal brief]. This irresponsible and disobedient act of the surveyor could be clearly no\u019fced from P2 in which he stated though he was asked to survey lot number 197 in the commission the correct number should be number 336. What were the materials he has used to make this mere statement has not been explained even in his evidence. Further the surveyor in his evidence has admi\u01a9ed that there can be a land by lot number 197 which has not been surveyed by him. The o\ufb03cer who was called to give evidence with regard to the ledger maintained in the o\ufb03ce of the divisional secretary has failed to adduce any evidence as to the connec\u019fon between lot numbers 197 and 336. Therefore it is my considered view that the plain\u019f\ufb00 has failed to adduce evidence with regard to the iden\u019f\ufb01ca\u019fon of the land and on that, one ingredient he was expected to prove has not been complied with.\u201d I am of the view that the High Court clearly erred on three grounds. The \ufb01rst is that it misread P2 and P2a, for the Surveyor has clearly stated in P2a and his evidence the basis for him to have concluded that lots 197 and 336 are one and the same. The second is that the 1C Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00 never made any such admission in his evidence at page 98, which I have re-produced earlier in this judgment. The third is that the O\ufb03cer from the Divisional Secretary\u2019s O\ufb03ce clearly stated that P1 has been issued in respect of Lot No. 336. With the evidence being that the land occupied by the Defendant was the land given to her father by P1, there could not have been any doubt with regard to the iden\u019fty of",

In any event, this O\ufb03cer from the Divisional Secretary\u2019s O\ufb03ce was not cross examined on the di\ufb00erence between the two lots, even though it was he who was in the best posi\u019fon to have clari\ufb01ed any doubt. Quite apart from the above errors, the High Court erred when it failed to consider the evidence of the Defendant to which I have already referred to which would have made it clear that the iden\u019fty of the land had been admi\u01a9ed by the Defendant and there was no dispute between the par\u019fes. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the High Court erred when it held that the Plain\u019f\ufb00 has not iden\u019f\ufb01ed the corpus and that the land referred to in P1 is not the land that has been surveyed and depicted in Plan P2. I would accordingly answer the third, fourth and \ufb01\u014ch ques\u019fons of law in the a\ufb03rma\u019fve. Summary A divisional bench of this Court was cons\u019ftuted by His Lordship the Chief Jus\u019fce in response to an applica\u019fon of the par\u019fes that there existed con\ufb02ic\u019fng decisions of this Court in rela\u019fon to the \ufb01rst, and more par\u019fcularly the second ques\u019fon of law, that being whether the failure to name a \u201clive party\u201d in the no\u019fce of appeal and the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal is contrary to the provisions in Sec\u019fons 755 and 758 of the Civil Procedure Code, and if so, whether such failure is fatal to the maintainability of such appeal. Given the inter-rela\u019fonship between the \ufb01rst and second ques\u019fons of law, my analysis of the issue was structured in two parts. Firstly, I considered the decisions of this Court where a case had been preferred against a deceased party, and took the view that the record is defec\u019fve from the outset and that Court has no jurisdic\u019fon at all to proceed with the case. However, in cases where a party was alive at the \u019fme of the ins\u019ftu\u019fon of proceedings but has passed away during the course of the proceedings, my conclusion is that the record becomes defec\u019fve no sooner such party passes away. Subs\u019ftu\u019fon must take place in order to cure this defect and proceed with the trial. If that is not done, the appellate Court has jurisdic\u019fon not only to set aside the judgment entered for/against the deceased party but must also set aside the proceedings that had taken place since the death of the party and direct that the defect be cured and for proceedings to re-commence from the point where the record became defec\u019fve. The ra\u019fonale for the above",

    "text": "course of ac\u019fon is that the party before Court must always be a \u201clive party\u201d in order for Court to exercise its jurisdic\u019fon. Having explained the ra\u019fonale behind the legal requirement for the subs\u019ftu\u019fon of a deceased party which in turn ensures that Court has jurisdic\u019fon over such case, I ventured to the second part of my analysis which speci\ufb01cally addresses the failure to name the subs\u019ftuted party in the no\u019fce of appeal and/or the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal and whether such failure is fatal, or curable under Sec\u019fon 770 of the Civil Procedure Code. In my view, Sec\u019fon 770 re\ufb02ects the inten\u019fon of the legislature that failure to name as a party to the appellate process a person who was a party in the lower court is a defect that is curable. To put it di\ufb00erently, naming a deceased party in the cap\u019fon who has already been subs\u019ftuted instead of naming the \u201clive party\u201d with whom the deceased party had been subs\u019ftuted is not fatal to the maintainability of such appeal. At that stage, Court is only mindful that such person must be heard before the appeal is decided, which then requires the par\u019fes who had not been named to be duly no\u019f\ufb01ed. Thus, Sec\u019fon 770 confers an unfe\u01a9ered discre\u019fon on the Judge who hears the appeal which discre\u019fon however should be exercised when some good reason or cause is given for the failure and where a ma\u01a9er could be remedied without any material prejudice being caused to the par\u019fes. If I am to relate these summary \ufb01ndings to this case, the Plain\u019f\ufb00 passed away while the case was proceeding before the District Court and subs\u019ftu\u019fon had taken place immediately therea\u014cer, of the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s, thus making the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s the \u201clive party\u201d to the ac\u019fon. The failure to name the Subs\u019ftuted Plain\u019f\ufb00s in the no\u019fce of appeal and the pe\u019f\u019fon of appeal is a defect that is curable and, given the facts and circumstances of this appeal to which I have already referred to, I am of the view that this was a \ufb01t case for the High Court to have exercised its discre\u019fon in favour of the Appellant and to have proceeded to hear and determine the appeal. This was the basis for my decision to answer the \ufb01rst and second ques\u019fons in the nega\u019fve. I therea\u014cer ventured to consider the third, fourth and \ufb01\u014ch ques\u019fons of law that required me to examine the facts of this case, the evidence and the judgments of the District Court and the High Court. The above three ques\u019fons of law were answered in the a\ufb03rma\u019fve only a\u014cer a careful examina\u019fon of such material.",
