Argued on: 01.04.2025

Decided on: 19.09.2025

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Plaintiff- Respondent-Respondent (‘Plaintiff’) filed the Partition Action No. P/273 in

the District Court of Badulla against the Defendants-Respondents-Respondents

(‘Defendants’), including the 2nd Defendant- Petitioner-Appellant (‘2nd Defendant’). The

Plaintiff's late father had filed a Partition Action bearing No. P/9298 (‘1st Partition case’)

previously in the District Court of Badulla and sought to partition the same land, which is the

corpus of the 2nd Partition case bearing No. P/273 (‘2nd Partition case’). The 1st Partition case

(‘P/9298’) was dismissed by the District Court on the basis that the pedigree had not been

proved and the corpus had not been identified. Upon an Appeal lodged against the said

Judgement, the Court of Appeal affirmed the said Judgement of the District Court.

The Plaintiff instituted the 2nd Partition case (‘No. P/273’) in the same District Court only

after the said dismissal of the 1st Partition case. In the said case, the District Court initially

considered the matter based on the principle of res judicata, and the primary question was as

follows: “Can the Plaintiff maintain the action on the principle of res judicata in view of the

Judgement in case No. P/9228 which has been recorded as an admission by the parties to the

action?”. The District Court, delivering its Order, dismissed the plea of res judicata raised by

the said 2nd Defendant and fixed the case for further trial. The 2nd Defendant filed a Leave to

Page 8 of 18

Appeal application against the said Order of the District Court, and accordingly, the

Provincial High Court of the Uva Province holden in Badulla (‘High Court’), exercising civil

appellate jurisdiction dismissed such Application, affirming the Order of the District Court.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the High Court, the 2nd Defendant instituted these

proceedings seeking to get both Judgements in the High Court and the District Court varied.

This Court granted Leave to Appeal as per the contents of paragraphs 18(c), 18(d) and 18(e)

of the Petition (dated 26.01.2015) of the 2nd Defendant. Accordingly, the questions can be

formulated as follows:

a) Did the learned Judges of the High Court and the learned District Judge fail to

correctly apply and/or examine the provisions of Section 75 (1) of the Partition Law?

b) Did the learned Judges of the High Court and the learned District Judge fail to

correctly apply and/or examine the provisions of Section 207 of the Civil Procedure

Code?

c) Did the learned Judges of the High Court and the learned District Judge err by

holding that the previous action bearing No. D.C. Badulla P/9298 had not been

dismissed on the merits when in fact the said action was dismissed inter alia on the

basis that the Plaintiff had failed to establish his title at the conclusion of a lengthy

trial?

The broader question that needs to be resolved by this Court is whether a plaintiff in a partition

action can initiate a fresh partition action if their initial action was dismissed after trial due to

failure to prove title and identify the corpus.

The primary contention of the 2nd Defendant is that the learned Judges of the High Court and

the learned District Judge failed to apply correctly and/or examine the provisions of Section

207 of the Civil Procedure Code and Section 75(1) of the Partition Law. Apart from the

emphasis placed in the Evidence Ordinance on the doctrine of res judicata, the Civil

Procedure Code too has placed substantial emphasis on the necessity for the operation of the

said doctrine concerning the procedure on civil litigation, specifically in Sections 24, 207 and

406 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Page 9 of 18

The said Section 207 declares that ‘all decrees passed by the court shall, subject to appeal,

when an appeal is allowed, be final between the parties; and no plaintiff shall hereafter be

non-suited’. Whereas Section 75(1) of the Partition Law stipulates that ‘the dismissal of a

partition action in respect of any land under section 9, section 12, section 29, section 62,

section 65 or section 70 shall not operate as a bar to the institution of another partition action

in respect of that land'. Accordingly, the 2nd Defendant contends that if a partition action is

dismissed for reasons other than those outlined in Section 75(1), particularly after a trial, it

prevents the filing of a second partition action concerning the same corpus.

The 2nd Defendant further argues that the said Section 75(1) of the Partition Law, read

together with Section 207 of the Civil Procedure Code, provides that all decrees in partition

actions are final, except for dismissals under Sections 9, 12, 29, 62, 65, or 70. It is submitted

on behalf of the said Defendant that any other decree under any other Section operates as res

judicata, barring a subsequent action on the same cause of action between the same parties.

The 2nd Defendant relies on the precedent enunciated in Nandawathie and Others v. Tikiri

Banda Mudalali (2003) 2 Sri LR 347, in which it was held that the principle of res judicata will

apply where the 2nd action is a.) Between the same parties; b.) Same subject matter; and c.)

Same cause of action. Additionally, the 2nd Defendant asserts that the High Court and the

District Court erred by applying principles enshrined in the case of Kandavanam v.

Kandaswamy 57 NLR 241, in which it was discussed whether res judicata would apply under

Section 406 of the Civil Procedure Code in an instance where the Plaintiff has failed to obtain

leave to file a fresh action.

In contrast, the Plaintiff submits that the cause of action in partition actions is a recurring

cause. In Abeysundera v. Babuna 26 NLR 459, the court held that:

“If one regards a partition action as an action founded on some cause, even if it be not such a

cause as falls within the: definition in section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code, then the cause of

action would seem to be a recurring one, that is, it is due to a continuance of the common

ownership, which exists from day to day as the inconvenience of common ownership recurs day

by day”.

Page 10 of 18

The Plaintiff argues that the principle of res judicata embodied in Section 207 would apply to

partition cases as a casus omissus provision in Section 79 of the Partition Law. The said Section

79 provides as follows:

“In any matter or question of procedure not provided for in this Law, the procedure

laid down in the Civil Procedure Code in a like matter or question shall be followed

by the court, if such procedure is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Law.”

The Plaintiff contends that Section 79 of the Partition Law provides that for any procedural

matter or question not addressed in the Partition Law, the procedures outlined in the Civil

Procedure Code should be applied, provided they are consistent with the provisions of the

Partition Law. Additionally, the Plaintiff emphasises that Section 75 of the Partition Law

pertains to specific instances occurring before the case reaches the trial or judgment stage, or

after judgment, which can be considered by anyone as pre-trial stages, except for instances

under Section 70 (‘non-prosecution of a partition action’) of the Partition Law. It is

highlighted that even the said Section 70 of the Partition Law does not pertain to a stage

where the case has reached finality.

The Plaintiff argues that Section 79, in conjunction with Section 75 (which identifies specific

sections allowing further Partition action after dismissal), enables other provisions of the Civil

Procedure Code, such as Sections 34, 207, and 406, to be applied in post-trial scenarios or

after a judgment/ decree has been issued. It is noted that the Plaintiff’s above submissions on

the said Sections 34, 207 and 406 of the Civil Procedure Code are on precluding a party from

bringing a fresh action, a phenomenon embodied in those sections. Consequently, the Plaintiff

contends that Section 79 supersedes Section 75 and Sections 34, 207, and 406 applicable to

‘decrees’ issued under the Partition Law, as supported by case law.

According to its preamble, the Partition Law provides for the partition and sale of land held

in common and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 2 of the

Partition Law declares that, where any land belongs in common to two or more owners, any

one or more of them, whether or not his or their ownership is subject to any life interest in

any other person, may institute an action for the partition or sale of the land in accordance

with the provisions of the said Law. The case of Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed 68 NLR 36

Page 11 of 18

highlights the unique nature of partition actions, where each party serves dual roles as plaintiff

and defendant. The Partition Law aimed at alleviating inconvenience due to undivided

possession, but often entailed contests over title. The Court in the said Mariam Beebee case

states that:

“One reason is, I think, that a partition action has always been recognised as having a special

character, in that every party has the double capacity of plaintiff and defendant. Though in theory

it is merely a proceeding by one or more admitted co-owners against the remaining co-owners, to

obtain relief from the inconvenience of undivided possession, in practice it often involves a contest

as to title-see Lucihamy v. Hamidu [ (1923) 26 N. L.R 41.].”

The Plaintiff cites the dicta in Marshal Perera and Others v. Elizabeth Fernando and Others 60

NLR 229 as well, underscoring the fundamental entitlement to relief under the Partition Law.

The court in the said case held:

“The Ordinance presupposes an inherent right in any person who is for the time being a co-owner

to secure a divided holding for himself or else, in appropriate circumstances, to obtain his

proportionate share in the proceeds of sale of the land. If, therefore, any notion of a ‘cause of

action’ is involved in a partition suit pure and simple, it is this inherent right of a co-owner for

the time being which constitutes the ‘cause of action’.”

As highlighted above, the Partition Law possesses a distinctive characteristic, and every party

involved in such action holds the dual role of both plaintiff and defendant. It is a legal

proceeding initiated by one or more co-owners against others to resolve the challenges of

undivided possession. Based on such unique features, the Plaintiff argues that if a partition

action is dismissed without determining the rights of the parties among themselves, such

dismissal cannot be used to employ the principle of res judicata in a later action by the plaintiff

to partition the same land. However, if there had been a decision regarding the title or the

corpus itself, that would serve as res judicata in a subsequent action. Thus, the Plaintiff

contends that he is entitled to have and maintain the aforesaid 2nd Partition case since the

District Court in the 1st Partition case declined to issue a partition decree and did not

determine the parties' respective rights and dismissed the case finding that the Plaintiff has

failed to prove the 'issues' - 'point of contest' in the Plaint. In this regard, the attention of this

Page 12 of 18

Court was drawn to the following issues framed in the 1st Partition action and the answers of

the Court thereto: (vide order dated 15.12.1994 of the District Court of Badulla in case no.

The District Court answered these issues as follows:

2. ලනාහැකිය

3. පැමිණිල්ල හා විත්තිය විසින් ඔවුන්ට හිමිවිය යුතු ලකාටස් ලකාපමණද යන්න නිසියාකාරෙ ඔප්පු කර

නැත

The Plaintiff asserts that, in terms of Section 207 of the Civil Procedure Code, what becomes

final between the parties is all decrees passed by the court. The Plaintiff relies on the judgment

in Aranappu De Silva v. Williams (1939-14 CLW 81), which held that Section 207 of the Civil

Procedure Code states in unambiguous terms that it is the decree passed by a court that is

final between the parties. Wijeyewardene J. in the said case observed:

“I find it difficult to assent to the proposition of law as stated by the learned District Judge.

Section 207 of the Civil Procedure Code states in unambiguous terms that it is the decree passed

by a court that is final between the parties. It is, no doubt true, that frequently the judgment and

even the pleadings in an action are examined in order to ascertain the questions of fact and law

that have become res judicata by the passing of the decree. This is done for the obvious reason

that the decree which states only the relief granted does not show the various questions of fact and

law which were put in issue or could have been put in issue between the parties. But where a court

Page 13 of 18

has to decide a question of res judicata in respect of the shares allotted to the parties in a previous

partition action, the decree alone need be considered as it contains normally all the necessary

information with regard to the shares”.

In this backdrop, the Plaintiff submits that the Partition Law stipulates two types of decrees,

namely, ‘interlocutory decree’ (Section 26) and ‘final decree’ (Section 36) and thus, the stages

enunciated in Sections 9, 12, 29, 62, 65 and 70 of the Partition Law do not fall into the ambit

of an interlocutory decree or final decree.

At this stage, I need to examine the scope of the trial in a partition action that is stipulated in

Section 25(1). Accordingly, the court shall examine the title of each party and shall hear and

receive evidence in support thereof and shall try and determine all questions of law and fact

arising in that action in regard to the right, share, or interest of each party to, of, or in the land

to which the action relates, and shall consider and decide which of the orders mentioned in

section 26 should be made. Section 26(1) declares that at the conclusion of the trial of a

partition action, the court shall pronounce judgment in open court. As soon as may be after

the judgment is pronounced, the court shall enter an interlocutory decree in accordance with

the findings in the judgment. As per Section 26(2) the interlocutory decree may include one

or more of the following orders, so however that the orders are not inconsistent with one

another: (a) order for a partition of the land; (b) order for a sale of the land in whole or in

lots; (c) order for a sale of a share or portion of the land and a partition of the remainder; (d)

order that any portion of the land representing the share of any particular party only shall be

demarcated and separated from the remainder of the land; (e) order that any specified portion

of the land shall continue to belong in common to specified parties or to a group of parties;

(f) order that any specified portion of the land sought to be partitioned or surveyed be excluded

from the scope of the action; (g) order that any share remain unallotted.

In terms of Section 36, on the date fixed pursuant to Section 35, or on any subsequent date

which the Court may fix for the purpose, the Court may, after summary inquiry: (a) confirm

with or without modification the scheme of partition proposed by the surveyor and enter final

decree of partition accordingly; (b) order the sale of any lot.

Page 14 of 18

It is noted that the Judgement dated 15.12.1994 in the 1st Partition case (Case No. P/9298)

was not followed by an interlocutory decree in accordance with the findings in the Judgement

as mandated in Section 26(1) of the Partition Law. The District Court in the said judgement

dated 15.12.1994 has not tried and determined all questions of law and fact arising in that

action in regard to the ‘right’, ‘share’, or ‘interest of each party’ to, of, or in the land to which

the action relates, and considered and decided which of the orders mentioned in section 26

should be made. In light of the above and based on the circumstances of this case, it can be

presumed that the said purported judgment in the 1st Partition case doesn't fall within the

decrees described in Sections 26 or 36 of the Partition Law.

Now I need to explore the effect of the doctrine of res judicata and its relevance to the

aforesaid 2nd Partition case. The doctrine of res judicata can be primarily understood through

the following paragraph in Randenigala Distilleries Lanka (Private) Limited v. Distilleries

Company of Sri Lanka- SC (CHC) Appeal No. 38/2010 (decided on 19.12.2014), where the

Supreme Court observed as follows:

“The concept of res judicata is a well-established principle of law designed to protect a party from

having to entertain repetitive legal attacks on the grounds of an issue that has already been

decided in full and final settlement by a court of law. Attempts of this kind under the smokescreen

of being a fresh issue are frowned upon and cannot be entertained by courts, for such actions seek

to discredit and abuse the finality of the legal process.”

Hence, the general principle is that once a court has tried an issue and delivered a final

decision, the parties cannot bring a fresh action on the same issue. His Lordship Justice Janak

De Silva, whilst in the Court of Appeal in Saundra Marakkala Imasha Lahiruni Upeksha v.

Hasitha Kesara Weththimuni- CA (Writ) 166/2017 (decided on 04.04.2019), states that ‘the

doctrine of res judicata prohibits the setting up of a cause of action which has been already

determined by a court of competent jurisdiction as between the same parties or their

representatives in interest’. Furthermore, in the said case, the Court identifies that Section 40

of the Evidence Ordinance gives effect to the concept of Res Judicata. The said Section 40

reads:

Page 15 of 18

“The existence of any judgment, order, or decree, which by law prevents any court

from taking cognizance of a suit or holding a trial, is a relevant fact, when the question

is, whether such court ought to take cognizance of such suit or to hold such trial.”

The requirements for the operation of the doctrine of res judicata have been highlighted to a

considerable extent in the paragraphs cited above. Thus, having the same parties and the same

causes of action is necessary. In further giving effect to the doctrine of res judicata, His

Lordship Justice Janak De Silva in the case of Centre for Environmental Justice (Guarantee)

Ltd. v. Anura Satharasinghe, Conservator General, Department of Forest Conservation and Others-

CA (Writ) 291/2015 (decided on 16.11.2020), opined that;

“This Court has had the benefit of perusing the pleadings filed in S.C.F.R. 130/2017 since they

have been filed of record in this application. I observe that the Petitioner in this case was not a

party to that application. Hence the doctrines of res judicata or issue estoppel do not apply as in

both instances it is necessary that the parties to the two cases and the cause of action (or issue

estoppel as in this case) must be the same for the two doctrines to apply. [Ran Menika v.

Gunasena and Another [C.A. 471/2000(F), C.A.M. 23.09.2019].”

The Court of Appeal in the above case referred to ‘cause of action estoppel’ and ‘issue

estoppel’. It is vital to address the principle of functus officio, which is central to determining

whether litigants should be limited to a single opportunity to present their case. This umbrella

concept of functus officio encompasses key elements such as res judicata, estoppel, abuse of

court process, the prohibition against collateral attacks, and waiver. When addressing functus

officio, it is important to recognize that its purpose is to ensure finality while concluding

judicial proceedings. The concept of issue estoppel is regarded as a subset of res judicata. The

concept of estoppel can be divided into two types: (i) cause of action estoppel and (ii) issue

estoppel. Notably, issue estoppel extends beyond a specific cause of action, preventing the

relitigating of issues already resolved by a competent court in later proceedings. Cause of

action estoppel refers to a situation where legal claims and obligations between parties, tied

to a specific cause of action, have been adjudicated in a prior case.

The Supreme Court in Nuwara Eliya District Housing Development Co-operative Society Ltd v.

Kelani Valley Plantations PLC (formerly Kelani Valley Plantations Limited) and Another- SC

Page 16 of 18

Appeal No. 70/2015 (SC Minutes of 03.04.2024) has drawn attention to the possibility of

applying issue estoppel not only to civil cases but also to judicial review. His Lordship Justice

Janak De Silva observed:

“In Jayanthu Ralalage Ranmenika v. Kiribandage Yogarathne and Others [C.A. Appeal

No. 471/2000(F), decided on 23.09.2019] I had to consider the applicability of issue estoppel

in Sri Lanka and concluded that as issue estoppel is part of English Law of Evidence in civil

cases, it is part of our law in civil cases in view of section 100 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Nevertheless, it must be considered whether proceedings for judicial review is a civil case in that

sense”

Finality is a fundamental and universally accepted requirement in judicial proceedings.

Without it, the same issue or the cause of action could be endlessly relitigated, preventing

resolution. The overarching principle of functus officio is central to determining whether

parties should be limited to a single opportunity to litigate. Anyhow, I am of the view that

when applying functus officio, the aim of the court should be to ensure finality while

maintaining fairness in judicial proceedings. In the case of Rajapaksha Appuhamilage Lionel

Ranjith v. Suraweera Arachchige Dona Leelawathi and Others (SC Appeal /100/2020, SC

Minutes of 14.05.2025), the Supreme Court analysed global legal trends, referencing the

English Court of Appeal case Worldwide Corporation Ltd v. GPT Ltd (1988 EWCA Civ 1894).

The English court, led by Lord Bingham, Peter Gibson, and Waller L.J., emphasised "overall

justice over individual justice," highlighting that delays in resolving cases undermine the

judicial system's efficacy and the interests of all court users.

The intricacies of court proceedings require a balanced approach that weighs both legal

technicalities and the wider principles of fairness and justice. This ensures that litigants'

legitimate rights are protected, reducing the risk of injustice due to procedural mistakes,

judicial biases, or misapplication of legal doctrines. Thus, when implementing the finality

doctrines mentioned earlier, it is essential to balance the pursuit of justice with the unique

circumstances of each case.

For comprehensive and fair adjudication, courts must prioritise whether a litigant's legitimate

rights have been affected. Legal theories, principles, and doctrines exist to support judges in

Page 17 of 18

fulfilling such responsibilities. If a litigant leaves the court with a lingering sense of unresolved

grievance after litigation, it undermines the effective application of the Rule of Law, Justice,

and Equality. Preliminary objections of a technical nature often emerge in routine court

proceedings. The superior courts have increasingly evaluated these objections by focusing on

case-specific circumstances rather than rigid adherence to traditional legal theories or

doctrines. Fairness and reasonableness should consistently be afforded to litigants who may

be adversely impacted by such factors. Conversely, no litigant should be granted the privilege

of exploiting the concept of functus officio under the pretext of fairness and reasonableness

when applying such doctrines.

According to Section 25(1) of the Partition Law, a court in a partition action must examine

each party’s title, hear evidence, and determine all questions of law and fact related to the

parties’ rights, shares, or interests in the land, before deciding on orders outlined in Section

26, such as partition, sale, or other arrangements. As observed previously, section 26(1)

requires the court to pronounce a judgment and enter an interlocutory decree based on its

findings, while Section 36 allows the court to confirm a partition scheme and enter a final

decree of partition or order a sale, after a summary inquiry. It is observed that the plaintiff in

the 1st Partition case (who was the father of the Plaintiff of the 2nd Partition case) failed to

prove the "issues" or "points of contest" outlined in the respective plaint, and no interlocutory

decree (under Section 26) or final decree (under Section 36) was entered. The District Court

in the 1st Partition case dismissed (purported judgment dated 15.12.1994) the action without

issuing a partition decree or determining the parties' respective rights, shares, or interests in

the land. Since the judgment in the 1st Partition case did not address the parties’ rights or issue

a decree under Sections 26 or 36, it does not constitute a final determination of the parties’

interests in the land.

As evident from the aforementioned judicial precedents, the Partition Law recognises the

inherent right of a co-owner to seek a division of property or a share of sale proceeds, which

ordinarily constitutes the notion of “cause of action" in a partition suit. Hence, I take the view

that the concept of ‘cause of action estoppel’ or ‘issue estoppel’ should not be employed in the

2nd Partition case, as the said case cannot be construed as relitigating of issues already resolved

by the District Court in the 1st Partition case. However, the doctrine of res judicata cannot be

completely barred from being employed to partition cases, and its application should be

evaluated based on the specific circumstances of each case, particularly in relation to the

concepts of ‘cause of action estoppel’ or ‘issue estoppel.’

On a careful consideration of the circumstances of the whole matter, I have come to the

conclusion upon the special circumstances of this case and the unique characteristics of the

Partition Law, the doctrine of res judicata should not bar the Plaintiff from proceeding with

the 2nd Partition case. For the reasons given above, I answer all three questions of law in the

negative. The Judgements of the High Court and the District Court are hereby affirmed and

the instant Appeal is dismissed without costs.
