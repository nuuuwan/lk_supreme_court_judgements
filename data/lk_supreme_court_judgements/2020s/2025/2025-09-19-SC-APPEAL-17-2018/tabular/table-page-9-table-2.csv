"In  contrast,  the  Plaintiff  submits  that  the  cause  of  action  in  partition actions  is  a  recurring"
"cause. In  Abeysundera v. Babuna 26 NLR 459, the court held that:"
"“If one regards a partition action as an action founded on some cause, even if it be not such a"
"cause as falls within the: definition in section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code, then the cause of"
"action  would  seem  to  be  a  recurring  one,  that  is,  it  is  due  to  a  continuance  of  the  common"
"ownership, which exists from day to day as the inconvenience of common ownership recurs day"
"by day”."
