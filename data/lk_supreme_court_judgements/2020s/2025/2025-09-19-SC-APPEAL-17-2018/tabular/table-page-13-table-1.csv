"partition action, the decree alone need be considered as it contains normally all the necessary"
"information with regard to the shares”."
"In this backdrop, the Plaintiff submits that the Partition Law stipulates two types of decrees,"
"namely, ‘interlocutory decree’ (Section 26) and ‘final decree’ (Section 36) and thus, the stages"
"enunciated in Sections 9, 12, 29, 62, 65 and 70 of the Partition Law do not fall into the ambit"
"of an interlocutory decree or final decree."
"At this stage, I need to examine the scope of the trial in a partition action that is stipulated in"
"Section 25(1). Accordingly, the court shall examine the title of each party and shall hear and"
"receive evidence in support thereof and shall try and determine all questions of law and fact"
"arising in that action in regard to the right, share, or interest of each party to, of, or in the land"
"to which the action relates, and shall consider and decide which of the orders mentioned in"
"section  26  should  be  made.  Section  26(1)  declares  that  at  the  conclusion  of  the  trial  of  a"
"partition action, the court shall pronounce judgment in open court. As soon as may be after"
"the judgment is pronounced, the court shall enter an interlocutory decree in accordance with"
"the findings in the judgment. As per Section 26(2) the interlocutory decree may include one"
"or  more  of  the  following  orders,  so  however  that  the  orders  are  not  inconsistent  with  one"
"another:  (a) order for a partition of the land; (b) order for a sale of the land in whole or in"
"lots; (c) order for a sale of a share or portion of the land and a partition of the remainder; (d)"
"order that any portion of the land representing the share of any particular party only shall be"
"demarcated and separated from the remainder of the land; (e) order that any specified portion"
"of the land shall continue to belong in common to specified parties or to a group of parties;"
"(f) order that any specified portion of the land sought to be partitioned or surveyed be excluded"
"from the scope of the action; (g) order that any share remain unallotted."
"In terms of Section 36, on the date fixed pursuant to Section 35, or on any subsequent date"
"which the Court may fix for the purpose, the Court may, after summary inquiry: (a) confirm"
"with or without modification the scheme of partition proposed by the surveyor and enter final"
"decree of partition accordingly; (b) order the sale of any lot."
