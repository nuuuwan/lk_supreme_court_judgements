"possession, but often entailed contests over title. The Court in the said Mariam Beebee case"
"states that:"
"“One reason is, I think, that a partition action has always been recognised as having a special"
"character, in that every party has the double capacity of plaintiff and defendant. Though in theory"
"it is merely a proceeding by one or more admitted co-owners against the remaining co-owners, to"
"obtain relief from the inconvenience of undivided possession, in practice it often involves a contest"
"as to title-see Lucihamy v. Hamidu [ (1923) 26 N. L.R 41.].”"
