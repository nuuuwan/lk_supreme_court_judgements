BEFORE : P. PADMAN SURASENA, J

E. A. G. R. AMARASEKARA, J

MAHINDA SAMAYAWARDHENA, J.

COUNSEL : Uditha Egalahewa, PC with Amaranath Fernando for the Petitioner.

Fazli Razik, DSG for the Respondents.

ARGUED ON : 20-06-2024

DECIDED ON : 14-03-2025

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

The Petitioner, at the time of filing this case, was a Deputy Inspector General of Police. He was

appointed to that post with effect from 20-06-2014.

1st - 38th Respondents are members of the Cabinet of Ministers; 39th Respondent is the Secretary

to the Cabinet of Ministers; 40th Respondent is the Inspector General of Police; 42nd Respondent

is the Secretary to the National Police Commission; 43rd Respondent is the Secretary to the

Ministry of Public Order and Christian Affairs; 44th Respondent is the Hon. Attorney General.

The Petitioner has cited the 44th Respondent (Hon. Attorney General) in this Petition both in terms

of Article 35(1) and Article 134 of the Constitution.

The Petitioner in this Case seeks to challenge an extension of service granted on contract basis,

to the 41st Respondent, to enable the 41st Respondent who is a Deputy Inspector General of

Police, to continue in service beyond the compulsory age of his retirement.

Upon this Petition being supported, having considered the submissions of Counsel, Court by its

order dated 12-08-2015, has decided to grant Leave to Proceed on the alleged infringement of

[SC FR 288/2015] Page 18 of 24

18

Petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution.

The Petitioner was due to attain the retirement age of 60 years on or about 21-07-2015.1 Out of

the twenty four Deputy Inspectors General of Police in their seniority list as at 03-06-2015, the

Petitioner was at that time, the most senior Deputy Inspector General of Police. The Petitioner

has produced the said seniority list marked P4. Thus, the Petitioner claims that he was the

officer next in line to be promoted as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police to fill the

vacancy that was to be created by the retirement of the 41st Respondent from service. The

Petitioner has claimed this expectation on the basis that he has possessed an unblemished record

in his career.

Upon the Cabinet Memorandum dated 09-06-2015 submitted by the Hon. Minister of Public Order

and Christian Affairs titled Re-employment on contract basis - Senior Deputy Inspector General

of Police - Mr. Gamini Nawarathne (the 41st Respondent), the Cabinet of Ministers, has decided

to grant approval to the following:

(i) to re-employ Mr. B. K. G. Nawaratne, Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police,

after his retirement, on contract basis, for a period of one (01) year with effect

from 21-07-2015;

(ii) to pay him a monthly allowance in terms of the provisions of P. A. Circular No.

09/2007; and

(iii) to provide him with other facilities entitled to the post.

The Cabinet of Ministers has made this decision at its meeting held on 10-06-2015.

In the course of the argument, Counsel appearing for the Petitioner placed reliance on the

document (marked R2) produced by the 39th Respondent who is the Secretary to the Cabinet of

Ministers. The 39th Respondent has annexed the said document to his affidavit dated 18-09-2015.

This document (R2) is the letter dated 25-05-2015 sent by the Hon. Attorney General addressed

to the Secretary of the Public Service Commission. In the said letter, the Hon. Attorney General

has taken the view that the Public Service Commission cannot exercise and discharge any powers

1 Paragraph 15 of the Amended Petition dated 28-07-2015.

[SC FR 288/2015] Page 19 of 24

19

referred to in Section 49(4) and 49(5) of the 19th Amendment in relation to Police Officers with

effect from 15-05-2015 which was the date on which the 19th Amendment to the Constitution

came into operation.

Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting held on 10-06-2015, having considered the letter dated 09-

06-2015 sent to it by the Secretary of the Public Service Commission, has decided that the Cabinet

of Ministers must exercise the aforesaid powers in respect of the Police Officers in view of the

fact that the relevant authority had failed to constitute the National Police Commission as at that

time. The 39th Respondent (Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers) has produced this Cabinet

Decision marked R4 annexing the same to his affidavit dated 18-09-2015. I observe that the

advice of the Hon. Attorney General (R2) was available before the Cabinet of Ministers when it

made the decision in R4.2

Clause 17 of the Minutes on Pensions produced by the Petitioner marked P6(c) is as follows:

Compulsory Retirement

17. Every public servant may be required to retire from the public service on or after

attaining the age of fifty-five years. Retirement shall be compulsory for every public

servant other than a Judge of the Supreme Court on his attaining the age of sixty years,

unless the competent authority decides that his services shall be retained.

In the case of midwives and female vaccinators of the Department of Health, retirement

shall be compulsory on attaining the age of fifty-five years unless the competent authority

decides that the officers services shall be retained.

17A. For the purposes of sections 12, 15 and 17, the expression competent authority

means the authority competent to make appointments to the office held by any public

servant referred to in those sections.

Thus, it is only the authority competent to make appointments to the office held by the 41st

Respondent which has the power to decide to continue to retain the service of the 41st Respondent

2 Clause 58 (iii) at page 2 of the Cabinet Decision dated 10-06-2015.

[SC FR 288/2015] Page 20 of 24

20

after his retirement age. The said authority is the National Police Commission and not the Cabinet

of Ministers.

The Petitioner has also produced before this Court, a copy of Procedural Rules made by the Public

Service Commission published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1589/30 dated 20-02-2009

marked P6(b). Even according to the said rules, the power to re-employ a person who has retired

from the public service is vested exclusively with the Public Service Commission. The relevant

rules are as follows;

Chapter XIII

Re-employment of a person retired from the Public Service

154. The power to re-employ a person who has retired from the public service

vests exclusively with the Public Service Commission.

156. A person who has retired from public service before reaching compulsory

age of retirement will not be re-employed in a post in the public service except

under exceptional circumstances. If such a person is re-employed it shall be done

on the basis of freezing his pension until he reaches the date of compulsory

retirement.

157. A person who has retired from the public service may be re-employed only

on contract basis. Such an appointment shall be limited to a maximum period of

one year at a time. The letter of appointment shall be prepared as per the

specimen in appendix 02.

175. The retirement of a public officer is governed by the Public and Judicial

Officers (Retirement) Ordinance, Rules made under that Ordinance, Minutes on

Pensions, and by the policy decisions of Cabinet of Ministers.

However, I have shown above that the Public Service Commission is not the authority which can

exercise the impugned power relevant to the instant case. i.e., the power to re-employ the 41st

Respondent on contract basis, for a period of one year, after his retirement.

The 41st Respondent in his affidavit dated 28-11-2015 has relied on the following in his attempt

to justify the extension of service granted to him by the Cabinet of Ministers:

[SC FR 288/2015] Page 21 of 24

21

I. The fact that he has possessed experience since 2001 as the Deputy Inspector

General of Police in charge of elections; he has been in charge of 28 elections; he

has discharged his duties honestly, independently, without any political favorations

and to the satisfaction of his superiors.

II. PAFFREL, which is the principal organization monitoring elections in this country,

has commended his services and discharge of his duties as the Deputy Inspector

General incharge of elections.

III. The fact that the National Police Commission had not been constituted at the time

in question.

IV. He had submitted a letter to the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Order and

Christian Affairs through the Inspector General of Police, seeking an extension of

service on contract basis with which the Inspector general of Police had agreed.

V. The fact that the Minister of Public Order and Christian Religious Affairs had

submitted a Cabinet Memorandum seeking the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers

for his request. He has produced the Cabinet Memorandum dated 09-06-2015,

observations of the Ministers of Public Administration, Local Government and

Democratic Governance and Finance dated 10-06-2015 and the Cabinet Decision

dated 18-06-2015, marked 41-R10, 41-R11 and 41-R12.

VI. The fact that he had conducted an inquiry into certain allegations leveled against

the Petitioner and submitted the report marked 41-R13 and certain other things

which he said were incidental to the said inquiry.

By those documents, the 41st Respondent has attempted to show that the Petitioner is an Officer

who has not had an unblemished record in his career. However, the issue to be decided by Court

in this instance is whether the decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers to extend the service of

the 41st Respondent beyond his retirement age is a decision lawfully made. Whether the Petitioner

is suitable to be appointed to the vacancy that would have been created by the retirement of the

41st Respondent is another matter which the National Police Commission should consider.

It was on 10-06-2015 that the Cabinet of Ministers has decided to re-employ the 41st Respondent

on contract basis for a period of one (01) year with effect from 21-07-2015.

[SC FR 288/2015] Page 22 of 24

The 17th Amendment to the Constitution introduced a new Chapter XVIIIA immediately after

Article 155 of the Constitution to establish the National Police Commission. Accordingly, Article

155G of the Constitution vested the National Police Commission with powers in relation to the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers other than

the Inspector-General of Police.

However, the 18th Amendment to the Constitution which was certified on 09th September 2010,

repealed Article 155G; it also repealed hitherto existed Article 55 and replaced it with new Article

55. That resulted in re-transferring the National Police Commissions powers in relation to the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers back to the

Public Service Commission. This brought the police officers back under the category of public

officers coming under the purview of the Public Service Commission. All matters pertaining to the

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers pending

before the National Police Commission stood transferred to the Public Service Commission by

virtue of section 36(5) of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution. This also brought the power

to provide for and determine all matters of policy relating to police officers back under the Cabinet

of Ministers by virtue of Article 55 (1) introduced by the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.

The 19th Amendment to the Constitution re-transferred the powers in relation to the appointment,

promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of police officers back to the National Police

Commission from the hands of the Public Service Commission. It re-introduced an article

numbered 155G in the following form;

155G. (1) (a) The appointment, promotion transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal

of police officers other than the Inspector-General of Police, shall be vested in the

Commission. The Commission shall exercise its powers of promotion, transfer,

disciplinary control and dismissal in consultation with the Inspector General of Police.

(3) The Commission shall, in consultation with the Inspector-General of Police, provide

for and determine all matters regarding police officers, including:-

a) the formulation of schemes of recruitment, promotion and

transfers, subject to any policy determined by the Cabinet of

Ministers pertaining to the same;

[SC FR 288/2015] Page 23 of 24

23

b) the formulation of schemes of recruitment, promotion and

transfers, subject to any policy determined by the Cabinet of

Ministers pertaining to the same;

c) training and the improvement of the efficiency and independence

of the police service;

d) the nature and type of the arms, ammunition and other equipment

necessary for the use of the National Division and the Provincial

Divisions; and

e) codes of conduct and disciplinary procedures.

(4) The Commission shall exercise all such powers and discharge and perform all such

functions and duties as are vested in it under Appendix I of List I contained in the

Ninth Schedule to the Constitution.

Thus, after the 19th Amendment to the Constitution it was the National Police Commission which

was charged with the power to provide for and determine all matters regarding police officers,

including the formulation of schemes of recruitment and promotion in consultation with the

Inspector-General of Police, subject to any policy determined by the Cabinet of Ministers

pertaining to the same. This was the legal position existed when the Cabinet of Ministers made

the decision contained in R 9 on 10-06-2015. This is because the law had changed by that time

as the 19th Amendment to the Constitution came into force with effect from 15th May 2015. This

is why Hon. Attorney General in the letter dated 25-05-2015 (R2) has rightly taken the view that

the Public Service Commission cannot exercise and discharge any powers referred to in Section

49(4) and 49(5) of the 19th Amendment in relation to Police Officers with effect from 15-05-2015,

which was the date on which the 19th amendment to the Constitution came into operation. It is

important to remember here that it was the 39th Respondent (the Secretary to the Cabinet of

Ministers) who has produced this letter (R2) with his affidavit.

Therefore, it is clear that the Cabinet of Ministers did not have any power to make the decision

contained in R 9 on 10-06-2015 to re-employ the 41st Respondent on contract basis for a period

of one (01) year with effect from 21-07-2015.

[SC FR 288/2015] Page 24 of 24

24

Therefore, the said decision is ab initio void in law. The Petitioner is therefore entitled to succeed

with his Petition. Therefore, I grant the following relief to the Petitioner:

a. A declaration that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner guaranteed in terms

of Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been violated;

b. A declaration that the 41st Respondent stands retired on the day he attains the

age of sixty years, i.e., on 21st July 2015;
