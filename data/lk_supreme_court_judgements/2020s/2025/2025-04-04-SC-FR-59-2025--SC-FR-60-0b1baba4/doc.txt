ARGUED ON: 1st and 3rd April 2025

DECIDED ON: 04th April 2025

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. Applications before us are out of several fundamental rights applications filed before the

Supreme Court challenging the decisions of Returning Officers of several Administrative

Districts to reject nomination papers tendered by certain recognized political groups and

independent groups in relation to the local authorities elections to be held on 06th May

2025.

GRIEVANCES OF THE PETITIONERS

2. The Petitioner in SC/FRA/59/25 came before this Court alleging violations of her

fundamental rights by the decision of the Returning Officer to reject the nomination

paper in toto on the basis of insufficient female candidates subsequent to her removal

from the nomination paper owing to the deficiencies in the affidavit submitted by her. It

was revealed that, while the Commissioner for Oaths who were to attest the same had

placed the official frank but not his or her signature.

3. In the factual circumstances relating to SC/FRA/60/25, two female candidates had failed

to include their names in the Affidavits, resulting in their removal from the nominations

list. Subsequent to their removal, as the nominations list did not have the required

number of female candidates, the same had been rejected in its entirety.

4. In SC/FRA/68/25, owing to the failure of the youth candidates to annex certified copies

of their certificates of birth, the entire nominations list had been rejected for its failure to

include the required number of youth candidates.

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 16 of 34

5. In SC/FRA/69/25, the failure of a woman candidate to duly take oath in terms of the

Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the failure of youth candidates to submit

certified copies of their birth certificates, who submitted copies certified by a Justice of

Peace instead, had caused their nomination paper to fall short minimum women

representation, thereby seeing the rejection of the entire nomination paper.

6. The Petitioners in SC/FRA/72/25 claim that their nomination paper was rejected on the

basis that it was submitted by an unauthorized person. However, when the matter was

taken up before the Court, various other fatal infirmities were revealed in the nomination

paper.

7. While none of the Petitioners made submission as to what fundamental rights have been

violated with the matters were taken up for argument on the 1st and 3rd of April 2025,

they have in their Petitions and written submissions alleged violations of Articles 12(1),

12(2) and 14(1)(a) of the Constitution.

ANALYSIS

8. For ease of analysis, I shall first consider SC/FRA/72/25. The nomination paper concerned

therein was ostensibly rejected on the basis of it being submitted by an unauthorized

person and the Petitioners contend the person who in fact submitted the same to have

been duly authorized. However, when this Court inquired into whether there is a

document authorising such person, or at least a copy thereof, the Petitioners were not

able to produce any such documentation. The learned Counsel submitted at this point

that the Petitioners had not maintained copies of what was submitted to the Returning

Officer. Accordingly, the Court directed learned Deputy Solicitor General to procure the

documents submitted by the Petitioners in SC/FRA/72/25 for its perusal.

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 17 of 34

9. Upon perusing such documents, it was revealed to the Court that the Petitioners had

filed Affidavits which bore no information of the Petitioners whatsoever. They were mere

empty forms with a flank and signature of a Justice of Peace. Accordingly, I am of the

view that, the rejection of a nomination paper which contains such colossal errors on the

face of it, could not amount to a violation of fundamental rights by any fiction of

imagination. These errors were such that it would even warrant stern action against the

Justice of Peace who attested the blank forms. Considering the aforementioned, this

Court is of the view that leave to proceed should not be granted for SC/FRA/72/25.

Accordingly, the Petition is dismissed.

The Requirement to Submit Certified Copies of the Certificate of Birth

10. Petitioners in SC/FRA/68/25, who only annexed photocopies of the birth certificates of

the youth candidates contended the rejection of their nomination paper on that basis to

be arbitrary, unreasonable, irrational, capricious and contrary to principles of natural

justice and the rule of law.

11. They further contended the submission of certified copies of birth certificates to not be

a mandatory provision under Section 31 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, No.

53 of 1946 and argued that the whole of the nomination paper ought not to be rejected

on the basis of such failure to submit certified copies of birth certificates.

12. Section 28(4A) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, as amended by Act, No. 25 of

1990, states very clearly that,

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 18 of 34

A certified copy of the birth Certificate of every youth whose name appears in the

nomination paper or an affidavit signed by such youth, certifying his date of birth

shall be attached to such nomination paper.1

13. Section 31 of the Ordinance, as amended, contains the provisions relating to rejection of

nomination papers. Section 31 states,

(1) The returning officer shall, immediately after the expiry of the nomination period,

examine the nomination papers received by him and reject any nomination

paper-

(a) that has not been delivered in accordance with the provisions of

subsection (5) of section 28 ; or

(b) that does not contain the total number of candidates required to be

nominated under subsection (2) of section 28 ; or

(bb) and (bbb) Repealed

(c) in respect of which the deposit required undersection 29 has not been

made; or

(d) Repealed

(e) where the signature of the secretary in the case of a recognized political

party or of the group leader in the case of an independent group does not

appear on the nomination paper or where such signature has not been

attested as required by subsection (5) of section 28; or

(f) that does not contain the total number of women and youth candidates

as required to be nominated under subsection (2A) of section 28 of this

Ordinance.

1 Emphasis added

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 19 of 34

(1A) Objections to a nomination paper may be made to a returning officer between

twelve noon and one-thirty O'clock in the afternoon of the- last day of the period

of nomination and no such objections shall be entertained by the returning officer

after one-thirty Oclock in the afternoon of that day.

(2) Where any nomination paper has been rejected by the returning officer under

subsection (i), the returning officer shall inform the secretary of the recognized

political party or the group leader, as the case may be, who had submitted such

nomination paper the fact of such rejection. The decision of the returning officer

to reject such nomination paper shall be final and conclusive.

(3) Where a candidate or any person whose name appears on a nomination paper

submitted by a recognized political party or an independent group, as the case

may be, is found to be disqualified due to the failure of such candidate or

person:-

(a) where the candidate or person concerned is a youth, to have attached

to the nomination paper a certified copy of his Certificate of Birth or

in the event the Certificate of Birth is not available an affidavit signed by

such youth certifying his date of birth; or

(b) to have his consent which is required to be included in such nomination

paper to be endorsed on the nomination paper, and to have annexed to

the nomination paper his oath or affirmation in the form set out in

the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution,

the nomination paper so submitted shall not be rejected, but the name of

the candidate or the person concerned who is found to be disqualified due

to any of the reasons specified in this subsection, shall be removed from

the nomination paper so submitted. Where a name of any candidate or any

person is removed from a nomination paper, the political party or the

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 20 of 34

independent group, as the case maybe, which submitted such nomination paper,

shall not thereafter be entitled to replace the name so removed with any other

new name and the deposit made in respect of the candidate or other person

whose names was removed, shall be forfeited.2

14. As it is amply clear from the above provision, a youth candidateas defined in Section

89 of the Ordinanceis required to attach to the nomination paper a certified copy of

his or her certificates of birth or an affidavit signed by such youth candidate certifying

the age, where the birth certificate is not available. Where this requirement is not fulfilled,

the Returning Officer is bound under Section 31 of the Ordinance to remove the name

of such defaulting youth candidate from the nomination paper.

15. Before we proceed to consider whether or not such removal of a candidate should affect

the minimum number of youth candidates required in terms of the law, let us consider

what exactly amounts to a certified copy.

16. It was submitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General that Section 56(1) of the Births

and Deaths Registration Act, No. 40 of 1975, as amended, sets out how a certified copy

of a certificate of birth may be obtained.

17. Section 56(1) of the Births and Deaths Registration Act states as follows:

Any person shall be entitled on making a written application to the appropriate

District Registrar or to the appropriate Additional District Registrar for to the

appropriate registrar, and under such conditions and on payment of such fees as may

be prescribed, to refer to any book or document in the possession of such District

Registrar, Additional District Registrar or registrar, and kept under this Act or under

any past enactment, and to demand a certified copy of, or a certified extract from,

2 Emphasis added

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 21 of 34

any entry in such book or document. The Registrar-General or an Assistant Registrar-

General may, on payment of such fees as may be prescribed, issue a certified copy of

or an extract from, any registration entry.

18. The learned Deputy Solicitor General further submitted the case of Maththaka Gamage

Pawaresena v. Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and 2 Others,3

where C Hettige, PC, J (P/CA, as His Lordship was then) held as follows:

I agree that the Justice of the Peace is not the custodian of the original records

relating to birth certificates and not authorized to issue certified copies of birth

certificates. And a certified copy of the birth certificate can be issued only by the

Registrar General of Births and or his Assistant Registrar General.

19. I find myself in agreement with the aforementioned views of Sathya Hettige, PC, J. While

a Justice of Peace, a Commissioner for Oaths or an Attorney-at-Law may attest a

document as a true copy, documents so attested does not amount to a certified copy.

A certified copy must be obtained from the custodian of the original and must be certified

by someone who is authorised to so certify. In any event, the Petitioners of the instant

application have submitted mere photocopies and such copies can no way amount to

certified copies.

20. The learned Deputy Solicitor General also invited the attention of this Court to the fact

that ample notice had been given to the parties of this requirement of annexing a copy

certified by Additional District Registrar. She conceded to the fact that initial guidelines,

handed out along with nomination papers, only mentioned that a copy of the certificate

of birth was required. However, thereafter, by further communication dated 14th and 15th

3 CA 75/2011, CA Minutes of 12th May of 2011

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 22 of 34

March 2025, the Commissioner-General of Elections and Assistant Commissioner had

clarified the requirement of such certificates of birth being certified by a District Registrar.

21. Hence, I am of the view that submitting a certified copy of the birth certificate or an

affidavit certifying a youth candidates age is a mandatory requirement, and this

requirement cannot be satisfied by merely submitting a photocopy or a copy attested by

a Justice of Peace.

Oath and Affirmation in the Form of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution

22. Section 28 (4) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance provides that,

The written consent of each candidate and each person being nominated by a

recognized political party or an independent group shall be endorsed on the

nomination paper and there shall be annexed to the nomination paper, an oath

or affirmation, as the case may be, in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule

to the Constitution, taken and subscribed or made and subscribed, as the case may

be, by every such candidate.

23. The nomination papers of some of the Petitioners aforementioned were rejected by the

Returning Officer based on deficiencies relating to the requirement of submitting an oath

or affirmation in terms of the above provision.

24. Section 12(2) of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance, No. 9 of 1895 provides,

A Commissioner for Oaths appointed under this Ordinance may administer any

oath or affirmation or take any affidavit for the purpose of any legal proceedings or

otherwise in all cases in which a Justice of the Peace is authorized by law so to do,

and in all cases in which an oath, affirmation, or affidavit is commonly administered

or taken before a Justice of the Peace; and any oath or affirmation or affidavit

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 23 of 34

administered or taken by a Commissioner for Oaths shall in all legal proceedings

and for all other purposes have the same effect as an oath, affirmation, or affidavit

administered or taken before a Justice of the Peace ; and all enactments relating to

oaths, affirmations, and affidavits administered or taken before a Justice of the Peace

shall, with the necessary modifications, apply thereto : Provided that a Commissioner

for Oaths shall not exercise the powers given by this section in any proceeding or

matter in which he is attorney-at law to any of the parties, or in which he is otherwise

interested.

25. The learned Deputy Solicitor General brought to the attention of this Court the case of

Ven. Weadinigama Wimalatissa Thero and Others v. R.M.R. Rathnayake and

Others,4 where the Court of Appeal considered the requirement of an oath or affirmation

with respect to the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution in relation to the Parliamentary

Elections Act, No. 1 of 1981. Nawaz, J (P/CA as His Lordship then was) observed therein,

Blacks Law Dictionary (11th Edition Bryan A. Garner at p. 1289) defines an oath to

be a solemn declaration, accompanied by a swearing to God or a revered person or

thing, that ones statement is true or that one will be bound to a promise.

This definition brings out the solemnity of an oath and imports and external agency

to whom the solemn declaration must be sworn. An affirmation is defined by Blacks

Law Dictionary as a solemn pledge equivalent to an oath but without reference to a

supreme being or to swearing. Both attract the penalty of forgery if the oath or

affirmation turns out to be untrue. There must be a witness to an oath or affirmation

who could speak to it having been made. Otherwise one can disavow a sacred oath

and yet claim that he took the oath. One can deny sovereignty of a state and clam

that he owes allegiance. He cannot just sign below the format of the oath and claim

4 C.A. (Writ) 86/2020, CA Minutes of 22nd June 2020

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 24 of 34

that he took the oath. An oath or affirmation by their intrinsic nature presupposes

the oral declaration of the oath or affirmation and signing it to signify its taking or

subscribing. It cannot be taken in secrecy. Thus there cannot be a self-pledge. It goes

without saying that an oath or affirmation as solemn as a pledge or promise has to

be administered

In Sri Lanka the Constitutional Oath introduced by the Sixth Amendment is

peremptorily made mandatory for not only those aspiring to be representatives of

the people but several other office holders. The mandate of the oath is spelt out in

Article 157A of the Constitution whilst its format is given in the Seventh Schedule.

Article 157A(8)(a) and (b) render the Seventh Schedule oath or affirmation

mandatory not only for Members of Parliament but also for those nominated as a

Member of Parliament. So when the mandate of Section 15(2) of the Parliamentary

Elections Act declares that every candidate must take the Seventh Schedule oath or

subscribe to an affirmation and have it endorsed on the nomination paper, he must

demonstrate his allegiance to the Constitution by scrupulously abiding by the form

and mode of taking the oath.

The prospective candidate has to manifest in the nomination paper that he would

uphold the sovereignty and integrity of the country. A mere signature below the oath

would not suffice. Article 157A(3) prescribed severe penalties for any person who acts

in contravention of the oath. It is not mere belief. If strict compliance is not insisted

upon, there would be no end to modifications or variations.

26. I see no reason as to why these observations should not apply mutatis mutandis to the

requirement under Section 28(4) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.

27. Accordingly, I am of the view that a Commissioner for Oaths not placing his or her

signature or an affirmant failing to place his or her name in an affidavit, as has happened

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 25 of 34

in the instant applications, are not curable defects, thus leading to a manifest non-

compliance with respect to the mandatory requirements set out in Local Authorities

Elections Ordinance.

Minimum/Total Number of Women Candidates

28. According to Section 31(1)(f) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, The returning

officer shall, immediately after the expiry of the nomination period, examine the

nomination papers received by him and reject any nomination paper- (f) that does not

contain the total number of women and youth candidates as required to be nominated

under subsection (2A) of section 28 of this Ordinance.

29. As the above provision is so couched in mandatory language, the Returning Officer has

no option but to reject a nomination paper in toto where such nomination paper does

not contain the total number of women and youth candidates as required under Section

28(2A) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.

30. The Petitioners placed heavy emphasis on the words total number of women and

sought to argue that they need not meet the thresholds set for the first nomination paper

and second nomination paper individually, so long as the total number of women

candidates is satisfied by considering both nomination papers as one unit. In other

words, the submission is that, where the number of women candidates in either

nomination paperbe it first or seconddoes not satisfy the percentage stipulated in

the Ordinance, the distinction between the two nomination papers must be ignored and

the total number of women candidates in both nomination papers must be considered.

31. Learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that such an interpretation to Section

31(1)(f) would require this Court to ignore or overlook Sections 28(2) and 28(2A) of the

Ordinance. It is a trite rule of statutory interpretation that provisions of a statute must be

interpreted harmoniously with other provisions of such statute rather than in isolation.

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 26 of 34

As such, any interpretation given to Section 31(1)(f) must necessarily be read

harmoniously with other provisions of the statute, including Sections 28(2) and 28(2A).

32. In any event, as one might very clearly observe Section 31(1)(f) itself refers to the

requirements of Section 28(2A). In such an instance, in my view, it would be a cardinal

error if one were to read the former provision without due deference to the construction

of the latter provision.

33. Section 28(2) of the Ordinance provides that,

Any recognized political party or independent group shall, for the purpose of election

as members of any local authority, submit two nomination papers in respect of all

wards of such local authority. The nomination papers submitted by every recognized

political party or independent group in respect of all wards of any local authority

shall consist of the number of candidates of whom not less than twenty-five per

centum of the total number of candidates nominated in both the First Nomination

Paper and the Additional Nomination Paper shall be youth candidates and of

whom, not less than ten per centum of the total number of members to be

elected and returned in the first nomination paper, and not less than fifty per

centum of the total number of candidates in the additional nomination paper

shall be women candidates for the purpose of election as members of such local

authority. The nomination papers submitted by every recognized political party or

independent group in respect of all wards of any local authority shall be substantially

in the Forms set out in the First Schedule, setting out the names-

(a) of candidates being nominated in respect of each ward of that local authority

which number shall be equivalent to sixty per centum of the total number of

members of that local authority:

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 27 of 34

Provided that where the number constituting sixty per centum referred to in

this paragraph is an integer and fraction, the integer shall be deemed to be

the number which shall constitute sixty per centum, for the purpose of this

paragraph.

(b) of such number of additional persons to be nominated as candidates to be

retuned as is equivalent to forty per centum of the total number of members

of the local authority plus three additional persons:

Provided that where the number constituting forty per centum referred to in

this paragraph is an integer and fraction, the integer shall be deemed to be

the number which shall constitute forty per centum, for the purpose of this

paragraph.5

34. In the aforementioned provision, the legislature very clearly prescribes the minimum

percentage of youth candidates for both first and second nomination papers, whereas

the minimum percentage of women candidates is clearly set out separately for the first

and second nomination papers. The construction of Section 28(2A) is similar, as I shall

highlight hereinbelow.

35. Section 28(2A) of the Ordinance provides that,

The Commissioner shall by notice published in the Gazette, specify the minimum

number of youth candidates to be nominated in total in both the First

Nomination Paper and the Additional Nomination Paper and the minimum

number of women candidates to be nominated in the First Nomination Paper

and the Additional Nomination Paper as referred to in subsection (2), in respect

of all wards of each local authority. Where-

5 Emphasis added

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 28 of 34

(a) the total number of youth candidates to be nominated is such that not less

than twenty-five per centum of the total number of candidates nominated in

both the First Nomination Paper and the Additional Nomination Paper; and

(b) the total number of women candidates to be nominated is such that not less

than ten per centum of the total numbers of members to be elected and

returned in the First Nomination Paper, and not less than fifty per centum of

the total number of candidates nominated in the Additional Nomination

Paper,

would be an integer and fraction, the integer shall be deemed to be the number

required for the purpose of this section.6

36. The Gazette Extraordinary No. 2425/70 dated 01st March 2025 has very clearly set out,

separately, the number of women candidates that must be included in the two

nomination papers.

37. Accordingly, I am of the view that the language in the statute in no way supports the

contention of the Petitioners. The construction of the statute makes it amply clear that

Retuning Officer are bound to consider the women candidate threshold set out for each

of the nomination papers separately.

Rejections of Nomination Papers in toto

38. Where a name of a youth or women candidate is disqualified and removed in terms of

Section 31(3) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, and such removal brings a

particular nomination paper below the youth or women quota requirement, should the

entire nomination paper be rejected?

6 Emphasis added

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 29 of 34

39. This is one of the questions that was very forcefully argued by the Counsel appearing for

the Petitioners, especially Mr. Alagaratnam, PC, Mr Ganesharajan and Dr. Guruparan.

40. Section 31(3) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance provides that,

(3) Where a candidate or any person whose name appears on a nomination paper

submitted by a recognized political party or an independent group, as the case

may be, is found to be disqualified due to the failure of such candidate or

person:-

(a) where the candidate or person concerned is a youth, to have attached

to the nomination paper a certified copy of his Certificate of Birth or

in the event the Certificate of Birth is not available an affidavit signed by

such youth certifying his date of birth; or

(b) to have his consent which is required to be included in such nomination

paper to be endorsed on the nomination paper, and to have annexed to the

nomination paper his oath or affirmation in the form set out in the Seventh

Schedule to the Constitution,

the nomination paper so submitted shall not be rejected, but the name of

the candidate or the person concerned who is found to be disqualified due

to any of the reasons specified in this subsection, shall be removed from

the nomination paper so submitted. Where a name of any candidate or any

person is removed from a nomination paper, the political party or the

independent group, as the case maybe, which submitted such nomination paper,

shall not thereafter be entitled to replace the name so removed with any other

new name and the deposit made in respect of the candidate or other person

whose names was removed, shall be forfeited.7

7 Emphasis added

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 30 of 34

41. Counsel placed heavy emphasis on the words nomination paper so submitted shall not

be rejected in the above provision, and rightfully so, for it indicates an intention to

preserve the nomination paper in spite of such defaults set out in paras (a) and (b) of

subsection 3. Prior to the amendment by Act, No. 22 of 2012, failure to attach certified

copies as required by Section 28(4A), was a ground for rejecting the nomination paper

itself under Section 31(1)(bbb). However, said Section 31(1)(bbb) was repealed by Act,

No. 22 of 2012 and the subsection 3 quoted above was included instead.

42. In light of this, Counsel for the Petitioners contended that where a candidate is removed

from the nomination list on the basis of Section 31(3)(a) or (b), such removal should not

affect the quota requirement set out in Sections 28(2) and 28(2A), thereby once again

reverting back to consider Section 31(1)(f). To this extent, the Petitioners contention, in

essence, is that the list of nominations at the time of submission must be considered for

the purpose of considering the question whether the minimum number of women and

youth candidates have been included in either of the nomination papers.

43. According to the submission of Dr. Guruparan, Article 31(1) contained such requirement

a Returning Officer ex facie considers at the very point of receiving the nomination

papers. Once the Retuning Officer is satisfied as to such requirements and moves on to

consider the requirements in terms of Section 31(3), such Retuning Officer must not

return to reconsider the requirements under Section 31(1) in light of whatever

disqualifications and removal there may be under Section 31(3) of the Ordinance.

44. The learned Deputy Solicitor General highlighted the fact that, in terms of Section 31(3),

where a youth candidate fails to attach a certified copy of the birth certificate or affidavit

and the oath or affirmation in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule to the

Constitution, the name of such candidate is to be disqualified and removed from the

nomination paper and no replacement is permitted in lieu thereof. She conceded that

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 31 of 34

such removal per se should not result in the rejection of the nomination paper. However,

it was her submission that the nomination paper must be rejected in toto where such

removal results in the minimum number of youth candidates specified by law not being

met.

45. As was held in Rajavarothiam Sampanthan and Others v. The Attorney-General and

Others,8

The next principle of interpretation which should be mentioned is that, where there

is more than one provision in a statute which deal with the same subject and differing

constructions of the provisions are advanced, the Court must seek to interpret and

apply the several provisions harmoniously and read the statute as a whole. That rule

of harmonious interpretation crystallises the good sense that all the provisions of a

statute must be taken into account and be made to work together and cohesively

enable the statute to achieve its purpose.

46. As Samayawardhena, J opined more recently in Chemisales Holding (Pvt) Ltd v.

Peoples Bank9

Harmonious construction is employed to resolve apparent inconsistencies or

contradictions within the same law. It rests on the principle that every statute is

enacted with a distinct purpose and intention and should, therefore, be interpreted

as a cohesive whole.

47. The learned Deputy Solicitor General further highlighted the adverse consequences that

may arise if the provision were to be otherwise interpreted. She submitted that it would

enable political parties to place some names of youth candidates, without proper birth

8 SC/FR/351-356, 358-361/2018, SC Minutes of 13th December 2018, at p. 61

9 SC/Appeal/148/2019, SC Minutes of 03rd April 2025, at p. 11

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 32 of 34

certificate or other documentation, merely for the purpose of fulfilling minimum

requirement, thus defeating the purpose of the amendment which brought about the

minimum women and youth candidate thresholds.

48. I am in agreement with the submission of the learned Deputy Solicitor General in this

regard. The legislature could not have intended there to be such a glaring loophole which

can so easily be abused. As the maxim ut res magis valeat quam pereat dictates, this Court

must interpret any statute in manner that makes them functional and effective rather

than defunct.

49. As such, this Court takes the view that any disqualification and removal of a candidate

under Section 31(3) of the Ordinance shall not result in the nomination paper being

rejected in toto, so long as such nomination paper meets the minimum threshold of

women and youth candidates in spite of such disqualification and removal.

50. Where a nomination paper contains youth or women candidates over and above the

bare minimum threshold and minimum number of youth and women candidate

requirement is still satisfied despite any disqualification or removal of any candidate

under Section 31(3), such nomination paper should not, and cannot in terms of the law,

be rejected by virtue of Section 31(1)(f) of the Ordinance.

CONCLUSION

51. Accordingly, I am of the view that none of the Petitioners have established any arbitrary,

mala fide, capricious or unreasonable treatment against them. Although allegations of

differential treatment were made by some Petitioners, none have substantiated such

allegations with evidence.

52. I am mindful of the fact that franchise is a right that is sacrosanct, and that it runs to the

very core of the freedom of expression. I am also mindful of the principle that legal

SC/FR/59/25 & Others JUDGMENT Page 33 of 34

provisions must be interpreted in a manner that makes such rights meaningful. While we

must bear in mind the importance of such principles, it is also necessary to prevent the

misuse of such revered rights at the expense of the citizenry. To that end, as Sharvananda,

J observed in Dissanayake v. Sri Jayawardenapura University.10 Regulations made in

the interests of efficiency, discipline, health, morality, public order and the like may

undoubtedly be imposed. Such regulations are not restrictions on the operation of the

guaranteed rights. Freedom has never been antithetical to regulation. Such regulations

are by no means obnoxious to the rule of law.

53. In line with what has been discussed hereinabove, I am of the view that leave to proceed

in SC/FRA/59/2025, SC/FRA/60/2025, SC/FRA/68/2025 and SC/FRA/69/2025 should be

refused. Accordingly, the Petitions are dismissed.

Application Dismissed.
