"On 04th April 2025, the above decision was read out in open court and the judgment was delivered."
"However, it was later informed that the caption of the judgment inadvertently did not bear the"
"caption  of  SC/FR/60/25.  Accordingly,  the  same  were  later  included  in  the  caption  and  the"
"judgment was reuploaded."
"Although  page  numbers  and  the  length  of  the  caption  may  differ  from  the  version  previously"
"published, the contents of the judgment, including paragraph numbers, remain unchanged."
