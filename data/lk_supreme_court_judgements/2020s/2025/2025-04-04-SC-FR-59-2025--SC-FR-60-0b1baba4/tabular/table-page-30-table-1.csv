"41.  Counsel placed heavy emphasis on the words “nomination paper so submitted shall not",""
"","be  rejected”  in  the  above  provision,  and  rightfully  so,  for  it  indicates  an  intention  to"
"","preserve the nomination paper in spite of such defaults set out in paras (a) and (b) of"
"","subsection 3. Prior to the amendment by Act, No. 22 of 2012, failure to attach certified"
"","copies as required by Section 28(4A), was a ground for rejecting the nomination paper"
"","itself under Section 31(1)(bbb). However, said Section 31(1)(bbb) was repealed by Act,"
"","No. 22 of 2012 and the subsection 3 quoted above was included instead."
"42.","In light of this, Counsel for the Petitioners contended that where a candidate is removed"
"","from the nomination list on the basis of Section 31(3)(a) or (b), such removal should not"
"","affect the quota requirement set out in Sections 28(2) and 28(2A), thereby once again"
"","reverting back to consider Section 31(1)(f). To this extent, the Petitioners contention, in"
"","essence, is that the list of nominations at the time of submission must be considered for"
"","the purpose of considering the question whether the minimum number of women and"
"","youth candidates have been included in either of the nomination papers."
