"in  the  instant  applications,  are  not  curable  defects,  thus  leading  to  a  manifest  non-"
"compliance  with  respect  to  the  mandatory  requirements  set  out  in  Local  Authorities"
"Elections Ordinance."
"Minimum/Total Number of Women Candidates"
"28.  According to Section 31(1)(f) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, “The returning"
"officer  shall, 
immediately  after 
the  expiry  of 
the  nomination  period,  examine 
the"
"nomination  papers  received  by  him  and  reject  any  nomination  paper-  (f)  that  does  not"
"contain the total number of women and youth candidates as required to be nominated"
"under subsection (2A) of section 28 of this Ordinance.”"
"29.  As the above provision is so couched in mandatory language, the Returning Officer has"
"no option but to reject a nomination paper in toto where such nomination paper does"
"not contain the total number of women and youth candidates as required under Section"
"28(2A) of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance."
"30.  The  Petitioners  placed  heavy  emphasis  on  the  words  “total  number  of  women”  and"
"sought to argue that they need not meet the thresholds set for the first nomination paper"
"and  second  nomination  paper  individually,  so  long  as  the  total  number  of  women"
"candidates  is  satisfied  by  considering  both  nomination  papers  as  one  unit.  In  other"
"words,  the  submission 
is  that,  where  the  number  of  women  candidates 
in  either"
"nomination paper—be it first or second—does not satisfy the percentage stipulated in"
"the Ordinance, the distinction between the two nomination papers must be ignored and"
"the total number of women candidates in both nomination papers must be considered."
"31.  Learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General  contended  that  such  an  interpretation  to  Section"
"31(1)(f) would require this Court to ignore or overlook Sections 28(2) and 28(2A) of the"
"Ordinance. It is a trite rule of statutory interpretation that provisions of a statute must be"
"interpreted harmoniously with other provisions of such statute rather than in isolation."
