"“The next principle of interpretation which should be mentioned is that, where there"
"is more than one provision in a statute which deal with the same subject and differing"
"constructions of the provisions are advanced, the Court must seek to interpret and"
"apply the several provisions harmoniously and read the statute as a whole. That rule"
"of harmonious interpretation crystallises the good sense that all the provisions of a"
"statute must be taken into account and be made to work together and cohesively"
"enable the statute to achieve its purpose.”"
