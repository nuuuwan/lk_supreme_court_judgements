JANAK DE SILVA, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (Appellant) instituted this action against the

Defendant-Appellant-Respondent (Respondent) seeking a declaration that the

Respondent has no right of way over the by-lane on the eastern boundary of the corpus

and for an order to remove the gate abutting the eastern boundary of the by-lane.

The Respondent in his answer denied the claim of the Appellant and moved that the plaint

be dismissed.

The District Court of Jaffna entered the judgment as prayed for by the Appellant.

Aggrieved by the judgment, the Respondent appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court of

the Northern Province holden in Jaffna.

The High Court set aside the judgment of the District Court and directed the learned judge

of the District Court of Jaffna to consider the entire evidence led in the case and write a

fresh judgment.

Leave to appeal has been granted on the following question of law:

(1) Whether the Civil Appellate High Court has interpreted Section 48 of the Judicature

Act No. 02 of 1978, as amended correctly in the circumstances of this case?

The factual matrix leading to the appeal is as set forth below.

The trial commenced before Judge A. The Appellant was the first witness. His evidence-

in-chief and cross-examination was concluded. The re-examination was partly completed.

Then Judge A was succeeded by judge B before whom the re-examination of the Appellant

was concluded. Furthermore, the evidence of Rasu Thuraisingham and Selvarasa

Page 3 of 4

Nesamany were also led on behalf of the Appellant and his case was closed. Thereafter,

the Respondent began his case and his examination-in-chief concluded before Judge B.

By the next day, Judge B was replaced by Judge C who decided to proceed to trial

disregarding the evidence led before his predecessors claiming that he had not formally

adopted the previous proceedings.

Judge C then allowed the re-examination of the Appellant and then recalled Rasu

Thuraisingham and Selvarasa Nesamany on behalf of the Appellant and the Respondent.

The learned judges of the High Court considered the procedure followed by Judge C

irregular.

Upon an examination of the papers filed before the High Court, we observe that this was

not a ground urged in appeal.

Moreover, we observe that parties had signed the record on 13.01.2010 indicating that

they have no objections to the procedure adopted by Court. In these circumstances, we

are of the view that the correctness of the adoption of the evidence by Judge C is not a

matter that could have been raised in appeal before the High Court. This is the only

ground on which the High Court set aside the judgement of the District Court.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer the question of law as follows:

“The High Court should not have considered the correctness of the procedure

adopted by Judge C as parties had signed the record agreeing to the course adopted

by Court.”

Accordingly, I set aside the judgment of the High Court dated 19.12.2014.

We direct the High Court to notice all parties and hear the merits of the appeal and deliver

judgment according to law.
