"The Plaintiff further averred that whilst the Plaintiff possessed the southern portion of"
"the land, the balance portion was possessed by the 1st Defendant and hence moved to partition"
"the corpus between the two of them."
"The schedule to the plaint only referred to the land based on a plan prepared by I.V."
"Koelmeyer  bearing  No.  10054  dated  02-07-1914,  wherein  three  boundaries  (North-  East,"
"South- West and North- West) were indicated as parts of the same land and the other (South-"
"East) as a road. It’s observed that the Plaintiff has failed to refer to any other plan or deed or"
"to the existing boundaries of the land to be partitioned as at the date of the plaint."
"The Defendant’s case"
"The 1st and 2nd Defendants (husband and wife) by their answer and statement of claim,"
"moved to exclude a portion of land from the corpus, based upon a different pedigree. On such"
"pedigree  and  chain  of  title,  a  portion  of  the  1A  2R  15P  land  referred  to  above  had  been"
"transferred to the 2nd Defendant, by way of a conditional transfer Deed bearing No. 3784 dated"
"20-10-1975 (2V4)."
"The Defendants further averred, that the father of the Plaintiff and 1st Defendant i.e.,"
"the predecessor in title, when he transferred his rights to the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant by"
"Deed bearing No. 23113 dated 27-04-1954 (P1) transferred only a portion of the land depicted"
"in the Plan bearing No. 10054 dated 02-07-1914 and not the entire extent as averred to by the"
"Plaintiff  in  the  plaint.  The  contention  of  the  Defendant  was  the  land  referred  to  in  the"
"conditional transfer Deed bearing No. 3784 dated 20-10-1975 (2V4) should be excluded from"
"the corpus to be partitioned."
"In the answer, the Defendant traced the pedigree to the said portion of land, to a Deed"
"bearing No. 4135 dated 25-04-1947. It is significant to note, that the said deed bears a date,"
"which is very much prior to P1. i.e., prior to the predecessor in title [viz., the father of the"
"Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant] transferring the title to the land in dispute to the Plaintiff and"
"the 1st Defendant in 1954."
"Thus, the contention of the Defendants was that since the 2nd Defendant, on her own"
"merits became the owner of a portion of land as depicted in Deed bearing No. 3784 dated 20-"
"10-1975, that such portion of land, should be excluded from the corpus."
"Furthermore, the Defendant pleaded that the balance portion of land i.e., excluding the"
"land  the  2nd  Defendant  on  her  own  merits  received,  was  amicably  partitioned  between  the"
"Plaintiff  and  the  1st  Defendant  and  produced  Plan  No.  4070  dated  21-07-1988  (1VI)  to"
"substantiate same."
"Hence, the crux of the issue in this appeal, is whether a portion of a land was excluded,"
"from the corpus to be partitioned between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant, or not."
"The trial"
"At the trial, the Plaintiff failed to produce any plans. The Plaintiff’s contention was"
"that the 1914 plan drawn up by Surveyor Koelmeyer, referred by him in the schedule to the"
"plaint, was in the custody of the 1st Defendant and that the 1st Defendant failed to produce the"
"said plan at the trial court."
