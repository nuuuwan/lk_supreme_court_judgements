"Furthermore, the trial judge, made no reference whatsoever to the purported settlement"
"of the corpus between the parties based upon the plan 1V1, since the said plan was totally"
"rejected  by  the  trial  judge  for  reasons  alluded  in  the  order  and  referred  to  earlier  in  this"
"judgement. However, it is observed that the learned Judges of the High Court who considered"
"the said plan, were silent on the findings of the trial judge enumerated earlier in this judgement,"
"when he rejected the plan 1V1, the purported amicable partitioning of the land, between the"
"Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant."
"The learned judges of the High Court referred to the ‘extent’ stated in the said plan"
"1V1, i.e., 1A 1R 0P and thereafter drew a comparison. They compared the difference of extents"
"of land, as stated in the schedule to the plaint and the Preliminary Plan ‘X’ (1A 2R 15P and"
"1A  2R  2.4P)  vis-a-vis  the  extent  of  land  referred  to  in  the  schedule  to  the  plaint  and  the"
"aforesaid 1V1 plan (1A 2R 15P and 1A 1R 0P) and came to a finding that the difference is"
"lesser in the first instance, viz between the extent stated in the schedule to the plaint and the"
"extent referred to in the Preliminary Plan (X) and therefore came to the conclusion, that the"
"Preliminary Plan is more in line with the plaint. For me it is difficult to understand the logic"
"behind  this  finding,  as  there  is  no  reasoning  or  legal  basis  whatsoever,  given  for  the  said"
"finding. A passing reference was also made stating the metes and bounds of the land in the"
"Preliminary Plan (X) matched the land referred to in the schedule to the plaint, although no"
"physical  verification  of  metes  and  bounds  took  place  as  specifically  stated  in  Surveyor"
"Wijeratne’s report X1."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judges  also  considered  the  contention  of  the  Defendants"
"pertaining to the amicable settlement based on the plan 1V1 and came to the conclusion since"
"there was no deed of settlement executed pursuant to the preparation of the plan 1V1, the said"
"plan prepared by Surveyor Jayasekera should be rejected upon the said ground."
"It is further observed, that though the High Court rejected the plan 1V1 on the said"
"ground, the High Court did not find the trial judge faulted in the trial judge’s reasoning for"
"rejection of the defendant’s contention, viz, that the said plan 1V1, should be rejected at it is"
"not based upon the 1914 plan or on any other plan."
"Having rejected the plan 1V1 for the aforesaid reason, the learned judges of the High"
"Court relying heavily on the ‘extent’ given in the preliminary plan ‘X’, (as discussed earlier"
"in this judgement) permitted the partitioning of the corpus, completely ignoring the paramount"
"duty of a trial judge to be satisfied, that the land to be partitioned has been correctly identified."
"The Appeal before the Supreme Court"
"Upon  reading  of  the  judgement  of  the  High  Court,  it  is  apparent  that  there  is  no"
"examination or analysis of evidence, nor reasoning as to why the findings of the trial  court"
"should be disputed or rejected."
"Furthermore, in determining the appeal in  favour of the Plaintiff and  permitting the"
"partitioning, the High Court has not considered the provisions of the Partition Law nor in the"
"least examined as to whether the land sought to be partitioned as referred to in the plaint, has"
"been  correctly  identified  on  the  ground.  This  is  particularly  important  because  the  Court"
"Commissioner Wijeratne, in the Preliminary Plan bearing No. 936 (X) and in his report (X1)"
