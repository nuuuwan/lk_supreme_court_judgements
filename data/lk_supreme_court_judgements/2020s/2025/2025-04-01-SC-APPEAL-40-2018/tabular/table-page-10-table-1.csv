"","Furthermore,  I  am  of  the  view,  the  learned  judges  of  the  High  Court  have  failed  to"
"appreciate the ratio of the said judgements referred to earlier and were in error, when they",""
"decided to set aside the judgement of the trial court and permit the partitioning of the corpus.",""
"","The  main  reasons  which  in  my  view  enumerate  as  erroneous  and  wrongful,  are  as"
"follows;",""
"-","the ‘extent’ of the corpus, which in any event was not established by the Plaintiff,"
"","cannot be used as the only criterion to identify the corpus in a partition action."
"-","the  statement  of 
the  Court  Commissioner  reflected 
in 
the  report  X1  of 
the"
"","preliminary plan X, that the land referred to in to plaint cannot be identified on the"
"","ground, cannot be merely brushed aside and ignored as irrelevant."
"","The submissions of the learned Counsel for the Respondents however, pertaining to"
"the Court Commissioner’s statement was that it was only the Surveyor’s opinion as reflected",""
"in Section 18(1) of the Partition Act and cannot be used to decide the matter finally.",""
"","Nevertheless, upon reading of the judgement of the learned District Judge, it’s quite"
"apparent, the learned trial judge in coming to his findings has not only looked at the opinion",""
"of the Surveyor but has clearly considered plan X and the entirety of the report X1, including",""
"the terrain, the ditches, the drains, the sand mounds referred to in the report X1 as well as the",""
"failure of the Plaintiff to call the said Surveyor, whom the judge referred to as an independent",""
"witness, to give evidence. The learned judge also considered the totality of the evidence led",""
"before court, including the two plans ‘X’ and ‘1V2’ prepared by the two Court Commissioners",""
"appointed by Court, to assist in its findings in arriving at its decision.",""
"","Thus, I see merit in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the"
"High Court was in error in its findings, when it decided to set aside the judgement of the trial",""
"court.",""
