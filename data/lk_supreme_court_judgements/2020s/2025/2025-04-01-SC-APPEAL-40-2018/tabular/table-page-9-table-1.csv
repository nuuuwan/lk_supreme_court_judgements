"categorically stated, that he is not satisfied that the land to be partitioned has been correctly"
"identified."
"The High Court judgement is silent on the said statement of the Surveyor Wijeratne"
"but based on a purported examination of the extents of land referred to in the Preliminary Plan"
"‘X’ and the extent referred to in the schedule to the plaint, had come to a finding in favour of"
"the Plaintiff and permitted the partitioning of the corpus as prayed for in the plaint, which in"
"my view is a complete misstatement of the law and a miscarriage of justice."
"Moreover, as discussed earlier in this judgement, the identity of the corpus has not been"
"a priority issue for the High Court.  The fact that the trial court rejected the plaint on the basis"
"that the land has not been identified had not been considered nor examined."
"Thus,  having  failed  to  consider  the  identity  of  the  land,  but  based  only  upon  the"
"purported extent of the land, the High Court overturned the trial court finding and permitted"
"the partitioning of the corpus, which goes against the jurisprudence pertaining to the Law of"
"Partition and specifically the provisions of Section 25(1) of the Partition Act, bearing No. 21"
"of 1977 as amended."
