"‘not the land physically depicted on the ground to be partitioned’, in the partition action before"
"the trial court."
"Furthermore,  it  is  observed  that  the  trial  judge  had  looked  at  the  metes  and  bounds"
"referred to in the two Court Commissioners’ plans. The judge had made special emphasis upon"
"the peculiar aspects of the land surveyed, the drains, the ditches, the mounds of sand, the live"
"fences and had examined in detail, the extent of the land vis-a-vis 1914 plan referred to in the"
"schedule to the plaint, but which the plaintiff failed to produce before the trial court."
"Based upon its analysis and evaluation, the trial judge has come to the finding that the"
"Plaintiff  has  failed  to  establish  the  identity  of  the  land  and  especially  that  the  land  to  be"
"partitioned referred to in the schedule to the plaint is the very same land physically depicted"
"on the ground, by way of the Preliminary Plan bearing No. 936 dated 10-02-2004, i.e., the"
"Court Commissioner Wijeratne’s Plan ‘X’ and more fully explained to in the report ‘X1’. The"
"learned judge thus, dismissed the plaint, upon the basis that the Plaintiff has failed to identify"
"the land to be partitioned between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant."
"High Court Judgement"
"In  a  very  short  judgement  dated  01-11-2016,  the  learned  judges  of  the  High  Court,"
"overturned the judgement of the trial court. No critical analysis pertaining to the grounds upon"
"which the learned trial judge dismissed the application i.e., failure to identify the corpus, was"
"discussed or considered. Only a bald statement to say that the trial judge has failed to evaluate"
"the evidence."
"No reference whatsoever is made by the High Court Judges to the 1914 Koelmeyer’s"
"plan. As discussed earlier, this plan referred to in the schedule to the plaint, was the foundation"
"of the Plaintiff’s case."
"Similarly, the High Court has failed to analyse or examine the failure of the Plaintiff"
"to  call  the  Court  Commissioner  Wijeratne  who  prepared  the  Preliminary  Plan  (X)  to  give"
"evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff and to consider the observations of the Court Commissioner"
"(in the report ‘X1’), that the land physically shown on the ground to the Court Commissioner"
"by the parties, cannot be identified vis-a-vis the land referred to in the schedule to the plaint."
"It appears the High Court judges have only considered the extent of the land in deciding"
"this appeal. The learned Judges have referred to the extent stated in the schedule to the plaint"
"i.e., 1A 2R 15P, and the extent referred to in Court Commissioner Wijeratne’s Plan (X). i.e.,"
"1A 2R 2.4P, and based only upon the said two figures, had come to the finding, that if Lot 1"
"referred to in Court Commissioner Wijeratne’s plan (X) is excluded, it would reduce the total"
"extent of land to be partitioned by 40 perches and upon that sole reason, overturned the trial"
"court judgement."
"Furthermore, the learned judges of the High Court have considered somewhat in detail"
"the  Plan  bearing  No.  4070  (1V1),  the  plan  relied  upon  by  the  Defendants  as  an  amicable"
"settlement of the corpus between the parties. As stated earlier in this judgement, the learned"
"trial judge disregarded  and rejected the said plan bearing No. 4070 (1V1), since it was not"
"based on the 1914 Koelmeyer’s plan referred to in the schedule to the plaint or based on any"
"other plan."
