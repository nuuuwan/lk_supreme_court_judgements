"18.  Submissions  were  also  made  with  regard  to  whether  a  question  of",""
"","constructive trust under section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance could be"
"","raised for the first time in appeal, without being raised at the trial."
"19.  Questions were raised as to whether the deed bearing No. 5609 was",""
"","subject to a trust, whether the alleged constructive trust continued to"
"","attach  to  the  land  when  it  was  conveyed  to  the  plaintiff  by  deed"
"","bearing No. 2306 and whether the plaintiff was a bona fide purchaser"
"","for  consideration  in  deed  No.  2306  and  if  so,  could  a  constructive"
"","trust attach on the plaintiff."
"20.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  defendants  in  his  written",""
"","submissions  submitted  that  the  attendant  circumstances  show  that"
"","there was a constructive trust  which arose in terms of section 83 of"
"","the Trusts Ordinance. It was further submitted that, the constructive"
"","trust does not permit Sujith Samantha to validly transfer the land to"
"","the plaintiff."
"21.  At the hearing of this appeal, the learned President’s Counsel did not",""
"","rely on the existence of a constructive trust or on the ground that the"
"","deed in issue (Deed bearing No. 5609) was null and void in terms of"
"","laesio enormis as originally relied on in the answer to the plaint. The"
"","learned President’s Counsel instead, relied on the position that it was"
"","in fact a mortgage. It was his submission that, the deed in favour of"
"","the plaintiff’s predecessor in title (deed bearing No. 5609) is in fact a"
"","mortgage."
"22.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  plaintiff  in  contention,  submitted  that,",""
"","while the existence of a mortgage has been a novel position raised for"
"","the first time at the stage of appeal to this Court, a  deed of transfer"
"","cannot be interpreted as a deed of mortgage."
"23.","In  order  to  substantiate  his  position,  the  learned  Counsel  relied  on"
"","several  authorities.  The  learned  Counsel  for  the  plaintiff  submitted"
"","the case of Fernando V. Coorey 59 NLR 169 at 171-172."
