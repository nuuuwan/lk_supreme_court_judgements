for  the  plaintiff

"to 
constructive

"the  existence  of  a  constructive  trust  was  neither  pleaded  nor  put  in"
"issue  at  the  trial  of  this  action.  The  High  Court  has  erred  in  law  by"
"proceeding to consider and decide on the existence of a constructive"
"trust without the matter being pleaded or put in issue at the trial."
