In 1937 the 1st defendant sold the land in dispute and another land to the 1st plaintiff for a sum of Rs. 1,410 of which Rs. 1,350 was set off against the principal",

By a contemporaneous deed the 1st plaintiff agreed to retransfer the lands to the 1st defendant if she paid a sum of Rs. 1,410 within a period of 5 years. The 1st defendant failed to comply with the terms of the agreement and the 1st plaintiff in 1949, gifted the land in dispute to the 2nd plaintiff. In an action brought by the plaintiffs against the 1st defendant and 4 others for a declaration of title etc., the defendants pleaded that the deed of sale in favour of the 1st plaintiff though in form a transfer was in fact a mortgage for the repayment of Rs. 1,410 and that the 2nd plaintiff had no title to the land. In support of this contention evidence, both oral and documentary, of the circumstances surrounding the transaction of 1937 and the subsequent conduct of the parties was led by the defendants. After considering the numerous decisions on the matter, Sansoni J. observed, \" If I may sum up the result of the authorities I have referred to I would say that it is never open to a party who executes a conveyance which is unambiguously a deed of sale to lead parol evidence to show that it is a deed of mortgage.\"",

That oral evidence is admissible for the purpose of proving a trust is conceded. Their Lordships held that the oral agreement sought to be proved in that case amounted not to a trust but to an agreement to transfer immovable property which would be invalid as it contravenes the provisions of section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance. Their Lordships also held that the decision in Perera v. Fernando [(1914) 17 N. L. R. 486.] sets out correctly the law of Ceylon. In that case it was held that where a person transferred a land on a notarial deed which on the face of it is a sale it was not open to the transferor to lead oral evidence to show that the transaction was in fact a mortgage because such evidence comes within the direct prohibition of section 92. It was also held there that evidence of subsequent conduct of parties was not admissible because \"conduct can only corroborate the oral evidence as to the original agreement.",
