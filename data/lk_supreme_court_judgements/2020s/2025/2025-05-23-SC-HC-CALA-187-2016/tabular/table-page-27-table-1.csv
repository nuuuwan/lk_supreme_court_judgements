"pending before the District Court by that time and the trial commenced only after 23/04/1998."
"The  terminology  in  Section  81(1)  brought  in  by  the  said  amending Act  does  not  exclude"
"pending action. Thus, the said provisions in said Section 81 also applies to the case at hand."
"As explained above, provisions of Section 81 of the Partition Law as amended applies until the"
"decision  of  the  first Appeal  by  the  Civil Appellate  Court,  and  since  no  leave  has  still  been"
"granted in the matter in hand, there is no continuation of the first Appeal or the original action"
"until leave is granted. Hence, it is important to observe how the substitution has to be done if"
"it becomes necessary. It must be reiterated that if leave is granted, it will be the continuation of"
"the original action or the first appeal subject to the decision being given in the final appeal."
"Thus,  any  substitution  that  is  going  to  be  taken  until  the  leave  is  granted  should  not  be  in"
"conflict with original scheme contemplated by Section 81 of partition law as amended. For"
"example, if the deceased has nominated a person to be appointed as the legal representative in"
"a memorandum filed, if a new person is substituted, once the leave is granted, new substitution"
"will be in conflict with the nomination made through the memorandum and there will be issues"
"as to who has the right to represent the deceasedâ€™s interests."
