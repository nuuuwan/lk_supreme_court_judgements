"ultimate goal is to continue the same action or first appeal if the leave is granted until a final"
"decision is given by this Court sitting in appeal. Thus, if a necessary Party as contemplated by"
"aforesaid Rule 28(5) is deceased prior to or after the High Court Judgment, what the aggrieved"
"party who intended to appeal against the judgment of the Civil Appeal High Court should do"
"is  to  bring  the  nominee  in  the  memorandum  as  the  legal  representative.  If  there  is  no  such"
"memorandum  has  been  filed,  it  is  true  that  the  aggrieved  party  can  make  application  to"
"substitute, but it cannot be said that the law expects that aggrieved party to go on a voyage of"
"discovery to find who the proper legal representative is as it is obnoxious to the intention of"
"the legislature not to delay partition actions on the ground of substitution. What the legislature"
"intended to avoid should not be allowed to be disturbed through a leave to appeal application"
"which is filed with the expectation of continuing the same appeal process. Thus, interpretation"
"and application of the Supreme Court Rules also has to be done in that background."
