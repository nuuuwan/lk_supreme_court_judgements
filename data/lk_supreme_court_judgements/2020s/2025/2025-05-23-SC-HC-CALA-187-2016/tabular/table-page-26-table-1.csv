"","1.  As  per  Section  4  and  81  of  the  Partition  Law  as  amended,  memorandum  is  filed"
"","nominating legal representatives for one to be appointed in the event of the nominators’"
"","death pending the final determination of the action. If an appeal is filed, the judgement"
"","or decree of the original court does not become final till the determination of the Appeal,"
"","and the finality depends on the decision of the appeal. Thus, the word ‘proceedings’"
"","found in Section 81(a), 10(a), (b), has to be interpreted to include the proceedings in"
"","appeal."
"2.","If  it  is  interpreted  to  say  that  the  filing  of  memorandum  and  provisions  relating  to"
"","nominations contained therein is applicable only till the delivery of the judgement by"
"","the original court, any aggrieved party who intends to appeal against the judgement will"
"","face an immense difficulty since the case record is not defective till the pronouncement"
"","of  judgement,  but  causing  that  party  to  find  suitable  legal  representatives  for  the"
"","deceased  parties  who  have  not  filed  their  respective  memorandums  and  get  them"
"","substituted and to serve notice of appeal within 14 days as per Section 755(2)(b) of the"
"","Civil  Procedure  Code.  Taking  such  steps  within  14  days  is  impractical  and  may  be"
"","impossible unless details relating to such legal representatives are known to the said"
"","aggrieved party. Law does not expect one to do impractical and impossible things. Final"
"","determination of a Partition Action reaches only with the allocation of shares and giving"
"","them to the relevant parties, but, if an appeal is pending, that is subject to the finality"
"","reached through the decisions of the Courts with Appellate Powers."
