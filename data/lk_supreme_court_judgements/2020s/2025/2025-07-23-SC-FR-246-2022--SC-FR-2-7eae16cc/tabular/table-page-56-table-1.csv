"","Minister  of  Public  Security  and  the  Inspector  General  of  Police"
"","had  by  their 
letters  dated  16th  July  2022  (“R3”)  and  (“R1”)"
"","requested from the President a declaration of  only a curfew by"
"","declaring a state of emergency."
"117)","On the other-hand, the following factors also prevailed:"
"","i. 
The  Executive  arm  of  the  State  (including  the  police  and  the"
"","Defence  establishment)  was  not  in  a  state  of  paralysis.  Had  it"
"","been so, it would not have been possible for the  police and the"
"","armed forces to successfully repulse the protest that took place"
"","on 13th July 2022. Nor was there any evidential basis to conclude"
"","that  there  was  an  imminence  of  the  execution  of  the  writ  of"
"","governance about to be paralysed."
"","ii. 
There 
is 
no 
evidence 
that 
outside 
Colombo 
and 
Sri"
"","Jayawardenepura  Kotte, 
there  were  any  protests  or  acts  of"
"","violence during this time."
"","iii. 
The  protesters  as  well  as  other  members  of  the  Public  did  not"
"","obstruct the supply of essential services and supplies. If at all the"
"","scarcity of essential services and supplies was due to the severe"
"","dearth of foreign exchange that was required to import medicine,"
"","petroleum, gas and certain other essentials."
"","iv. 
Unlike during the protests in the Colombo Fort on 12th July 2022,"
"","after the protest of 13th July 2022 at the Polduwa junction at Sri"
"","Jayawardenepura  Kotte  was 
repulsed, 
there  was  neither  a"
"","mobilisation  of  the  masses  nor  an  ongoing  continuous  protest"
"","near the Parliament."
"","v. 
Due to the improvement in the situation, the duration of curfews"
"","that  had  been  declared  on  13th  and  14th  July  2022  had  been"
"","gradually  reduced.  If  there  was  a  perceivable  uncontrollable"
"","situation  brewing  as  at  17th  October  2022,  a  reduction  of  the"
"","duration of curfew would not have taken place."
"","vi. 
The former President acting in terms of section 12 of the Public"
"","Security Ordinance had continually called out the armed forces"
"","to assist the police in its law enforcement duties, and the last such"
"","order made was in force as at July 2022."
"","vii. 
Even if the northern end of the Galle Face Green, the Presidential"
"","Secretariat,  President’s  House,  the  Prime  Minister’s  Office  and"
"","SCFR 246, 261, 262, 274 & 276 / 2022 - JUDGMENT
