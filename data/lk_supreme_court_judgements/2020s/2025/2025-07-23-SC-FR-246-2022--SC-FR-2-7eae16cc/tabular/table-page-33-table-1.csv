"this  provision  relates  to  all  instances  (such  as  the  instance  impugned  in  these"
"Applications) where a Proclamation has been issued under section 2 of the PSO."
"His  submission  was  that  the  drafters  of  the  Constitution  intended  to  keep  the"
"issuance of a Proclamation of Emergency outside the realm of judicial review. He"
"argued  that,  even  during  the  post-21st  Amendment  era,  Article  35  does  not"
"override  the  ouster  clause  contained  in  Article  154J(2).  His  position  was  that  a"
"Proclamation made under section 2 of the PSO was akin to a declaration of war"
"and peace. Therefore, while Regulations promulgated pursuant to a Proclamation"
"may be challenged, as the Proclamation itself is based on a subjective assessment"
"by the President of the prevailing situation (which only he would be competent to"
"determine  given  the  circumstances  existent  at  that  time),  a  Proclamation  made"
"under section 2 of the PSO is excluded from judicial review."
