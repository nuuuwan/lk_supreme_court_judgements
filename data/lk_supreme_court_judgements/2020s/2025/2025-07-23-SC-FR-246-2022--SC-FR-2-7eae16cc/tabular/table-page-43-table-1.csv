"issuing directions to a Governor of a Province regarding the manner in which he"
"should exercise executive power, would Article 154J(2) oust the Supreme Court"
"under the jurisdiction vested in it by Article 126 read with Article 17, of judicially"
"reviewing  the  making  of  such  Proclamation  and  the  directions  so  issued?  The"
"determination of  these  Applications  would  not  be  founded  upon the  answer  to"
"that question. Therefore, I shall leave it for another day."
"88) In view of the foregoing, I overrule the objection raised by learned Counsel for"
"the  Respondents  that  this  Court  does  not  have  the  jurisdiction  to  judicially"
"review  a  Proclamation  made  by  the  President  under  section  2  of  the  Public"
"Security Ordinance."
