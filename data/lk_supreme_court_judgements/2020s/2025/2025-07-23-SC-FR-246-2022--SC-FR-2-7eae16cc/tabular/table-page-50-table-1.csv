"imminence  of  a  ‘public  emergency’,  the  next  segment  contained  in  section  2"
"provides for a different basis for judicial review. That is evident from the language"
"used by the legislature. Section 2 provides that, ‘where the President is of opinion"
"that it is expedient so to do in the interests of public security and the preservation of"
"public  order  or  for  the  maintenance  of  supplies  and  services  essential  to  the  life  of  the"
"community, the President may …’.  The legal terminology used may be conveniently"
"referred to as ‘subjective language’. It is seen that the Parliament has conferred on"
"the President the entitlement to form a view founded upon his assessment of the"
"prevailing ground situation (that being the existence of a public emergency) or the"
"imminence of the ground situation converting itself into a public emergency that"
"is  to  arise.  It  is  apparent  that  by  using  subjective  language,  the  Parliament  has"
"conferred on the President wide discretionary authority."
