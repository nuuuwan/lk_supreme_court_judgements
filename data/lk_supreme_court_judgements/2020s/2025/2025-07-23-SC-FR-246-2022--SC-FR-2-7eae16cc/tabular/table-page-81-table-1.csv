"","before  this  Court  are  certainly  unprecedented  in  the  annals  of  the  history  of  this"
"","Country. [paragraph 41]"
"(2)","Court cannot brush aside the fact that the key events referred to by the parties to"
"","these applications are matters so etched even in our memory. That is particularly"
"","due to we too being citizens of this country who led our lives the way any other"
"","citizens  lived  during  that  era  and  not  in  ivory towers or  silos.  There  are  picture-"

"","before this Court, I conclude that as at 17th July 2022, when the President declared a"
"","state of Emergency with effect from 18th July 2022, an extraordinary situation which"
"","had serious security implications, existed in Sri Lanka. I also conclude that, the"

"","Parliament being blocked and thereafter the Parliament being virtually encircled"

"","holding  of  the  scheduled  election  in  Parliament  on  20th  July  2022  in  terms  of"
