"agreement with the majority opinion that on the facts and circumstances of this case, “it"
"is highly doubtful (although the run up to the 17th July 2022, there was an extraordinary situation)"
"whether the ground situation that prevailed as at 17th July 2022 amounted to ‘a state of public"
"emergency’”.  In  arriving  at  my  conclusion  that  there  in  fact  existed  a  state  of  public"
"emergency, I am guided by the material placed by the Petitioners, the factual scenario"
"that prevailed as at 17th July 2022 and the affidavit of the Secretary to the President, the"
"annexures thereto, and the communication of the Acting President to the Speaker."
