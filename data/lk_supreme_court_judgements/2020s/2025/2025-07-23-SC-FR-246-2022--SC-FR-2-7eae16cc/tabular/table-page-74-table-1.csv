"President acted unreasonably when he issued the impugned Proclamation, and that his"
"action is therefore arbitrary."
"G
rounds of review and unreasonableness"
"I
n Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service [1985 AC 374] [the"
"GCHQ case], Lord Diplock stated that one can conveniently classify under three heads"
"the grounds upon which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review."
"The  first  ground  was 
'illegality', 
the  second  was 
'irrationality'  and 
the 
third  was"
"'procedural impropriety'. There is no dispute that the President has the power in terms"
"of Section 2(1) of the Ordinance to issue the impugned Proclamation, and thus, the vires"
"of his decision is not an issue. Similarly, there is no dispute that the procedure laid down"
"in  the  Ordinance  has  not  been  followed  and  thus,  there  is  no  irregularity  with  the"
"procedure followed."
"L
ord Diplock thereafter went on to state that, “By ‘irrationality’ I mean  what can  now be"
"succinctly referred to as ‘Wednesbury unreasonableness’ [Associated Provincial Picture Houses"
"Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation 1948 (1) KB 223]. It applies to a decision which is so outrageous"
"in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his"
"mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.”"
"T
he standard adopted by Lord Diplock in the GCHQ case is intrinsically linked to Lord"
"Greene’s  dicta 
in 
the  case  of  Associated  Provincial  Picture  Houses,  Limited  v."
"Wednesbury  Corporation 
[1948  1  KB  223]  which  was 
the  birth  of  Wednesbury"
"unreasonableness  and  one  of  the  first  instances  where  English  Courts  recognised  that"
"there was no requirement to justify judicial intervention on the basis of a mistake of law,"
"inferred or otherwise, where the decision was ‘something so absurd that no sensible person"
"could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority.’ The famous example of the"
"redhaired  teacher  who  was  dismissed  because  of  the  colour  of  her  hair,  illustrates the"
"threshold for ‘unreasonableness’ that was expected."
"A
 common feature in these two cases is that for Courts to intervene, the decision of the"
"public  authority  in  question  must  not  just  be  unreasonable,  but  must  be  manifestly"
"unreasonable,  which  emphasises  the  fact  that  judicial  scrutiny  of  decisions  of  public"
"authorities,  in  the  absence  of  illegality  or  procedural  impropriety,  should  only  be  in"
"exceptional circumstances."
