"93) Mr.  Hewamanne  also  submitted  that  there  exists  a  precondition  in  law  for  the"
"issuance of a Proclamation under section 2 of the PSO.   That being an actual or"
"imminence  of  a  public  emergency  arising,  threatening  the  continued  life  of  the"
"community. The danger must be so severe that it should even temporarily threaten"
"the continued life of the community. He asserted that the President himself must"
"formulate an opinion as to whether or not an actual state of emergency exists. That"
"should be founded upon an objective assessment of the precondition referred to"
"above.  He  must  also  form  a  view  as  to  the  inadequacy  of  the  normal  powers"
"available to him to deal with the situation that has arisen. The President cannot"
"form  this  opinion  in  an  arbitrary  manner.  It  must  be  grounded  upon  objective"
"standards,  so  as  to  ensure  that  his  decision  on  the  matter  is  reasonable  and"
"justifiable."
