"Emergency  Regulations,  as","they  are  enacted  by  an  authority  outside 
the"

"a 
state  of  Emergency,  he","can,

"","Regulations, override any law and even restrict the exercise of fundamental rights"

"","authorise  behaviour  towards  citizens,  which  otherwise  (in  terms  of  the  regular"
"law) is expressly forbidden by law.",""
