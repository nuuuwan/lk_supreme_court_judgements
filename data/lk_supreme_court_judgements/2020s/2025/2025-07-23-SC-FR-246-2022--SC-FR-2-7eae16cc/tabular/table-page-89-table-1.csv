"A
lthough  the  contents  of  the  letter  and  the  Proclamation  are  only  a  reiteration  of  the"
"grounds set out in Section 2(1), to my mind, it is evident that the Acting President was"
"fully conscious of the requirements of the law that he was required to be satisfied prior"
"to making a Proclamation under Section 2(1). To ask for further reasons for forming the"
"opinion would therefore be an exercise in futility."
"I
t is not the duty of this Court to evaluate the incidents that took place and decide whether"
"the evidence justified the decision or to determine whether the incidents that took place"
"constitute sufficient grounds to declare a state of public emergency. Instead, it is the duty"
"of this court to determine whether the requisite state of mind of the President to declare"
"a state of public emergency was “reasonable, in good faith and was on proper grounds”."
"In other words this Court should determine whether it was ‘reasonable’ for the President"
"to be satisfied on the facts that existed to form the opinion that a state of public emergency"
"which  threatens  the  life  of  the  nation  and  which  warranted  a  declaration  of  a  state  of"
"public emergency has arisen. It must be kept in mind, as held by H. A. G. De Silva, J. in"
"Wickremabandu  v  Herath  [(1990)  2  Sri  LR  348]  that 
it  is  a  different  standard  of"
"reasonableness that is applicable here, as the opinion of the President does not relate to"
"the commission of past acts as it is in the general circumstances, but to the future security"
"of the nation."
"W
hen  evaluating  the  incidents  that  took  place  prior  to,  and  immediately  prior  to  the"
"declaration of emergency and drawing from the past experience and the destruction that"
"was caused, the above explained test of reasonableness in the wide sense, urges me to"
"conclude  that  any  sensible/reasonable  authority  acting  with  due  appreciation  of  its"
"responsibilities could have decided to arrive at such a decision. Upon the facts known to"
"the Acting President including the past experiences wherein clashes and mob violence"
"escalated to destruction of life and property on a mass scale, it was ‘not unreasonable or"
"irrational’ for him to have formed the opinion that a declaration of a State of emergency"
"was a necessity. Therefore, in my view, the opinion formed by the President that there"
"existed a situation of public emergency that warranted the declaration of a state of public"
"emergency and the declaration made in the exercise of such subjective discretion with a"
"view  to  prevent  any  occurrence/incident  that  is  prejudicial  to  public  security  was"
"necessary and reasonable. And if the decision is within the confines of reasonableness, it"
"is no part of the Court's function to look further into the merits."
