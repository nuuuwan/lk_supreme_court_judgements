"The  Bar  Association  of  Sri  Lanka  [BASL]  reiterates  its  call  for  a  smooth  and  peaceful"
"transition of power and welcomes the short time frame adopted by the party leaders which"
"should be adhered to."
"T
he contribution and sacrifices made by the people seeking a real change in Sri Lanka during"
"the last few months are immeasurable."
"W
hilst it is important to keep in focus the demands and aspirations of the protesting public,"
"it is equally important to ensure an orderly transition, continued respect for the Rule of Law"
"and to Constitutionalism in Sri Lanka. Respect for the Rule of Law and to Constitutionalism"
"is essential to protect the rights of the people of Sri Lanka and their livelihoods."
"T
he BASL is deeply concerned of statements attributed to various parties including those"
"who  were  part  of  the  protest  groups  which  appear  to  undermine  the  Rule  of  Law  and"
"Constitutional governance in Sri Lanka.  The BASL unequivocally states that at this"
"decisive time in our country it is absolutely necessary that all citizens respect the"
"Rule of Law and Constitutional governance. It is not in the best interests of our"
"country  or  its  people  to  ignore  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  which  is  the"
"framework  under  which  Sri  Lanka  is  governed.  Respect  for  the  Constitution,  its"
"institutions  and  the  Rule  of  Law  will  ensure  the  continuing  functions  of  the"
"Government which are vital to the life of the community and its people."
"T
he  BASL  also  notes  that  the  President’s  House,  Temple  Tree,  and  the  Presidential"
"Secretariat  are  being  occupied  by  members  of  the  protest  groups  and  that  large  crowds"
"continue  to  visit  the  premises.  The  BASL  is  extremely  concerned  of  reports  of  acts  of"
"vandalism at Temple Trees and the President’s House. We call upon those occupying these"
"premises to ensure that the proper authorities are given custody of these buildings. We also"
"call  upon  those  occupying  them  to  ensure  the  protection  of  documents  and  other  public"
"properties, many of which are of archeological significance. We also call upon them to respect"
"the sanctity of these buildings."
"W
e  urge  all  parties  to  continue  to  find  solutions  to  the  current  economic  and  political"
"instability in a democratic manner, through the existing constitutional framework and legal"
"process and to advocate for changes in a manner that does not undermine the administration"
"of justice.”"
