"","42) I cannot brush aside the fact that the key events referred to by the parties to these",""
"","Applications are matters so etched even in our memory. That is particularly due",""
"","to we too being citizens of this country who led our lives the way any other citizens",""
"","lived  during that  era  and  not  in  ivory towers  or  silos.  There  are  picture-perfect",""
"","images in our own memory of the key events referred to by both the Petitioners",""

"","analysis  of  the  situation  that  prevailed  and  conclusions  reached,  to  the  factual",""
"","contents of the evidence presented by both parties, including the contents of the",""
"","documentary evidence presented. Nevertheless, it would be necessary for me to",""

"","lawfulness or otherwise of what happened, which are not strictly relevant to the",""
