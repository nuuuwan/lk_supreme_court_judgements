"containing any force of law or legal effect, stems out of what is declared by Court"
"to be a nullity. Thus, the need to pronounce on the vires of the President’s exercise"

"relating  to  judicial  review,  that  Emergency  Regulations  are  subject  to  judicial"
"review  founded  upon  the  principles  of  Constitutionalism  including  the  Rule  of"
"Law, and the principles of necessity, proportionality, reasonableness, rationality,"
"and respect for non-derogable fundamental rights."
