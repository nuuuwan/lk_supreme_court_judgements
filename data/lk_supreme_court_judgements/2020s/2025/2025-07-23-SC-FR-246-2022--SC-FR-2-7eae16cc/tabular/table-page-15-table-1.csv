"C
riticism of the Petitioners",""
"","32) The  principal  criticism  of  the  Petitioner  in  SC/FR/246/2022  against  the  afore-"
"","stated Proclamation is that, it had not been issued by the then Acting President,"
"","and had been merely singed and issued by the Secretary to the President. It was"
"","asserted on behalf of the Petitioners that there was no evidence placed before this"
"","Court by the Respondents to establish that the said Proclamation had in fact been"
"","issued  by  His  Excellency  the  Acting  President  Ranil  Wickremasinghe  himself."
"","Learned counsel for the Petitioner claimed that thus the purported Proclamation"
"","is not valid in law. Further, he argued that in any event, the situation that prevailed"
"","at the time of the issue of the Proclamation did not warrant and justify the making"
"","of a Proclamation under section 2 of the Public Security Ordinance. The Petitioner"
"","in  SC/FR/276/2022  also 
took  up 
the  same  position.  However,  during 
the"
"","consolidated  hearing  into  all  Applications  relating  to  this  Judgment,  learned"
"","counsel 
in  SC/FR/276/2022  conceded  that  particularly  upon  perusal  of  the"
"","original Proclamations signed by His Excellency the Acting President in Sinhala,"
"","Tamil and English languages which were subsequently ordered to be published in"
"","the Gazette and also to be communicated to the Honourable Speaker (along with"
"","the  corresponding  minutes,  dated  17th 
July  2022)  as  contained 
in 
the 
file"
"","maintained  by  the  Presidential  Secretariat,  there  was  sufficient  proof  that  His"
"","Excellency  the  Acting  President  Ranil  Wickremasinghe  had  himself  issued  the"
"","impugned  Proclamation 
[“P6(a)”,  “P6(b)”,  and  “P6(c)”].  However, 
learned"
"","Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  in  SC  FR  246/2022  persisted  in  his  criticism  that  the"
"","Acting  President 
himself 
had 
not 
issued 
the  Proclamation.  A  detailed"
"","consideration of this criticism will follow."
