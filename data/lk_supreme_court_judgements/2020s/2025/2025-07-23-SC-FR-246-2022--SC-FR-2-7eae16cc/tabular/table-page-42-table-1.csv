"considerably  enhanced  and  superior  responsibility  of  paramount  importance  to"
"proceed beyond the mere judicial adjudication of disputes and make orders (under"
"the just and equitable jurisdiction conferred by Article 126(4) of the Constitution)"
"for the protection of fundamental rights of the People. The Parliament in its own"
"wisdom  appears  to  have  taken  note  of  who  the  collective  Sovereigns  of  the"
"inter  alia 
Democratic  Socialist  Republic  are,  and  the  importance  of  ensuring"
"through the Supreme Court the protection of their fundamental rights. By vesting"
"that special jurisdiction on the Supreme Court, the Parliament on the one hand has"
"called upon the Supreme Court to move beyond the conventional role of Courts"
"(being the judicial adjudication of disputes) and to assume a proactive stance in"
"the  protection  of  fundamental  rights.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Parliament  has"
"ensured 
that  such  protective  measures 
the  Supreme  Court 
imposes,  reigns"
"supreme,  only  secondary  to  the  Constitution  itself  and  the  Rule  of  Law.  The"
"framers  of  the  Constitution  have  been  acutely  conscious  that  the  full  and  free"
"exercise  of  Sovereignty  by the  People  according  to  their  will  would  be  possible"
"only if the People both collectively and individually have the opportunity to freely"
"exercise  their  fundamental  rights.  Fundamental  rights  serve  as  the  bedrock  on"
"which the People exercise their Sovereignty. Therefore, as a means of protecting"
"the  Sovereignty  of  the  People  by  ensuring  the  protection  of  their  fundamental"
"rights,  this  Court  has  been  vested  with  the  jurisdiction  to  protect  fundamental"
"rights. That highlights the importance of the jurisdiction which the Supreme Court"
"shall exercise in terms of Article 126 read with Article 17 of the Constitution. Thus,"
"the ability to judicially review executive and administrative decisions and actions"
"of even the President is a Constitutional duty the Supreme Court has been vested"
"with,  and  which  cannot  be  ousted  by  any  statutory  provision  or  an  incidental"
"provision contained in the Constitution itself, meant to provide for a completely"
"different  situation.  The  Constitutional 
jurisdiction 
to  determine 
the  alleged"
"infringement or imminent infringement of fundamental rights can be ousted only"
"by a specific, express provision, and that too not by the application of a ‘ouster’ or"
"‘finality’  clause,  but  by  conferring 
immunity 
to 
the  President  and 
thereby"
"specifically  excluding 
the  exercise  of 
jurisdiction  under  Article  126  of 
the"
"Constitution. The Constitution as it stands today has done so only in one instance,"
"that being by the 2nd proviso to Article 35(1), i.e. the declaration of war and peace."
