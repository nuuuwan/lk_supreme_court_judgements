"33) The Petitioners also vehemently criticised the Acting President for having taken"
"action purportedly under section 2 of the Public Security Ordinance to declare a"
"state of Emergency and thereby for having brought Part II of the Ordinance into"
"force. Their submission was that the ground situation which prevailed as at 17th"
"July  2022  was  not  a  ‘public  emergency’  and  therefore  in  no  way  warranted  the"
"President to issue a Proclamation under section 2 of the Public Security Ordinance"
"and declare Emergency. A detailed consideration of that submission will follow."
"34) The Petitioners also as a group alleged that the Emergency (Miscellaneous Provisions"
"and  Powers)  Regulations  No.  1  of  2022  (hereinafter  sometimes  referred  to  as  ‘the"
"impugned Emergency Regulations’) were coloured by political and other motives,"
"and were aimed at crushing dissent and protests, censuring criticism, and resulted"
"in an unprecedented curtailment of the exercise of the fundamental rights of the"
"people. They claimed that expression of dissent is a healthy and robust component"
"of  a  true  democracy  and  thus  suppression  of  dissent  was  undemocratic  and  an"
"infringement of fundamental rights. In the circumstances, they have sought from"
"this Court, a determination that the afore-stated Proclamation declaring a state of"
"Emergency  was  unconstitutional,  unnecessary,  was  made  for  extraneous  and"
"political  reasons,  and  was  a  violation  of  the  purposes  of  the  Public  Security"
"Ordinance."
