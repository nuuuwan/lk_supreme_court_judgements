n  9th  June,  2022,  the  brother  of  the  then  President  who  had  served  as  the  Finance"
"Minister until April 2022, and who was  also blamed for the severe economic hardship"
"that  the  People  were  enduring  at  that  time,  resigned  from  Parliament.  The  date  “9th“"
"appears to have achieved a symbolic status by this time."
"F
ast  forward to  9th  July  2022.  A  large group  of  protestors,  numbering  over  a  hundred"
"thousand, arrived in Colombo from different parts of the Country. They converged in the"
"Colombo Fort, and thereafter stormed the President’s House, the official residence of the"
"President, and occupied the said premises. The then President, who was occupying the"
"President’s House  at this time, was evacuated by the Security Forces through the rear"
"gate.  The  protestors  thereafter  forcibly  entered  the  Presidential  Secretariat,  the  nerve"
"centre of administrative governance of the Executive and occupied the said premises."
"I
n the late evening of 9th July 2022, a mob set ablaze the private residence of the newly"
"appointed  Prime  Minister.  The  protestors  also  entered  Temple  Trees, 
the  official"
"residence of the Prime Minister. Perhaps the only action of the protestors that was foiled"
"was the attempt made on 10th July 2022 to enter the official residence of the former Prime"
"Minister who had resigned pursuant to the events that took place on 9th May 2022. The"
"storming of the President’s House, the Presidential Secretariat, and Temple Trees, and"
"the arson committed on the private residence of the newly appointed Prime Minister as"
"well  as  the  attempt  to  storm  the  official  residence  of  the  former  Prime  Minister,"
"demonstrated a wide range of strategic targetting by protestors. Thus, the stage was being"
"set for the re-enactment of the anarchy witnessed on 9th May 2022, at possibly a larger"
"scale."
"I
n  the  meantime,  the  democratically  elected  President  left  the  Country.  The  newly"
"appointed  Prime  Minister  was  appointed  to  act  as  President  while  the  President  was"
"away.  The  People  were  anxiously  waiting  from  9th  July  for  that  moment  when  the"
"incumbent  President  would  resign  from  office,  which  was  a  primary  demand  of  the"
"protestors. Four days later, on 14th July 2022, the Speaker announced that the President"
"had 
resigned, 
triggering 
the 
critical  need 
to  put 
in  motion 
the  Constitutional"
"requirements to enable Parliament to elect a new President."
"W
ith it being clear that Parliament must meet as required by the Constitution to elect a"
"new  President,  the  hub  of  the  protests,  which  until  then  had  been  centered  around"
"Colombo,  the  President’s  House  and  the  Presidential  Secretariat  saw  a  shift  from  the"
