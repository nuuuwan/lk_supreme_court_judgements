"","Regulations dated 18th July 2022 are a nullity and is deemed to have never had the"
"","recognition of the law."
"132)","The Attorney General is directed to, within three (3) months from the date"
"","of this Judgment incorporate the principles of law contained in this Judgment into"
"a  detailed","legal  advisory,  and 
forward  such  advisory 
to 
the  Office  of  His"
"","Excellency the President for necessary consideration. A copy of that advisory is to"
"","be filed of record in this Court."
"133)","Though  this  Court  has  not  pronounced  on  the 
legality  of 
individual"
"","Emergency Regulations that have been impugned (as the need to do so did not"
"","arise), the Attorney General is directed to pay due regard to the substance of the"
"","submissions made in that regard by learned counsel for the Petitioners, and advice"
"","the Office of His Excellency the President in a fitting manner."
"134)","Learned brother, Honourable Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere shared with me"
"","the draft of his separate opinion regarding this matter. I have considered it in great"
"","detail. I find myself in respectful disagreement with his approach leading to the"
"","final conclusion he has reached, due to among others the following reasons:"
"","(i)  In my opinion, it would be incorrect to proceed on the footing that once the"
"","President has formed an objective view that a 'public emergency' exists, he"
"","need  not  consider  other  options  available  to  him,  and  can  immediately"
"","proceed  to  issue  a  proclamation  under  section  2  of  the  Public  Security"
"","Ordinance. If that be the case, what would be the meaning to be attributed"
"","to the term 'expedient' in section 2?"
"","(ii) The enactment of Part III of the Ordinance is clear proof of the Parliament"
"","having  considered  the  availability  of  other  options.  If  the  only  course  of"
"","action 
to 
respond 
to  a  public 
emergency  was 
the  making  of 
the"
"","Proclamation  under 
section  2  of 
the  Ordinance, 
then  why  did 
the"
"","Parliament by an amendment to the original Ordinance introduce Part III"
"","of the Ordinance?"
"","(iii) 
There may be certain public emergencies that can be responded to"
"","effectively  without  issuing  a  proclamation  under  section  2  of  the  Public"
"","Security Ordinance and promulgating Regulations under section 5 of the"
"","SCFR 246, 261, 262, 274 & 276 / 2022 - JUDGMENT
