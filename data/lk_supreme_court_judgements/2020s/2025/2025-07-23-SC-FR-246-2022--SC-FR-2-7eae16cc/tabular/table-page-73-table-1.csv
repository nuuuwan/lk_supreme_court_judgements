"Court has to be cautious to ensure that the application of the guarantee of equality does not"
"finally produce iniquitous consequences. A useful safeguard in this respect would be the"
"application of a basic standard or its elements, wherever applicable. The principal element"
"in the basic standard as stated above is reasonableness as opposed to being arbitrary. In"
"respect of legislation where the question would be looked more in the abstract, one would"
"look at the class of persons affected by the law in relation to those left out. In respect of"
"executive  or  administrative  action  one  would  look  at  the  person  who  is  alleging  the"
"infringement and the extent to which such person is affected or would be affected. But the"
"test once again is one of being reasonable and not arbitrary. Of particular significance to"
"the facts of this case, the question arises as to the perspective or standpoint from which such"
"reasonableness should be judged. It certainly cannot be judged only from a subjective basis"
"of hardship to one and benefit to the other. Executive or administrative action may bring"
"in its wake hardship to some, such as deprivation of property through acquisition, taxes,"
"disciplinary  action  and  loss  of  employment.  At  the  same  time,  it  can  bring  benefits  to"
"others,  such  as  employment,  subsidies,  rebates,  admission  to  universities,  schools  and"
"housing  facilities.  It  necessarily  follows  that  reasonableness  should  be  judged  from  an"
"objective basis."
"W
hen applied to the sphere of the executive or the administration the second element of the"
"basic standard would require that the impugned action, is based on discernible grounds"
"that have a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation in terms of which the"
"action  is  taken  or  the  manifest  object  of  the  power  that  is  vested  with  the  particular"
"authority."
"T
herefore,  when  both  elements  of  the  basic  standard  are  applied  it  requires  that  the"
"executive  or  administrative  action  in  question  be  reasonable  and  based  on  discernible"
"grounds that are fairly and substantially related to the object of the legislation in terms of"
"which  the  action  is  taken  or  the  manifest  object  of  the  power  that  is  vested  with  the"
"particular  authority.  The  requirements  of  both  elements  merge.  If  the  action  at  issue  is"
"based on discernible grounds that are fairly and substantially related to the object of the"
"legislation  or  the  manifest  object  of  the  power  that  is  vested  in  the  authority,  it  would"
"ordinarily follow that the action is reasonable. The requirement to be reasonable as opposed"
"to arbitrary would  in this context pertain to the process  of  ascertaining and evaluating"
"these grounds in the light of the extent of discretion vested in the authority.‚Äù"
