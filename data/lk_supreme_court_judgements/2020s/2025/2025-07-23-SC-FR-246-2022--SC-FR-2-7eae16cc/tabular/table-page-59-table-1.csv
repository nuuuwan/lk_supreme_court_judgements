"","unlawful  or  illegal  activity  or  any  protest  on  20th  July  2022  at  the"

"","Magistrate or police officer not below the rank of an Inspector of Police"
"","may command such unlawful assembly to disperse. Further, section 98"
"","of the CCPA empowers a Magistrate to inter alia direct that an unlawful"
