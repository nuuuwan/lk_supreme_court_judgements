"","serious than a temporary upheaval of the ‘law and order’ situation of the country"

"","PSO and thereby declaring ‘a state of public emergency’ is the protection of the"

"","strengthen authoritarianism and thereby suppress, restrict or infringe the exercise"
"","of fundamental rights of the People. Even in a situation where the threat or attack"
"","is on the State apparatus or a part thereof, emergency measures are to be adopted"
"","to repel or thwart such threat or attack, purely because a threat or attack on the"
"","State would adversely affect and injure the interests of the  public  and not since"
