"would have had negative repercussions on the country. He argued that therefore,"
"His  Excellency  the  President  had  resorted  to  the  least  intrusive  measure  in"
"controlling the situation that was prevalent in the country."

iews of the Court and Conclusions reached"
"105) 
As stated in a preceding part of this Judgment, section 2 of the PSO confers"
"on the President executive power of an extraordinary nature, that being, in a given"
"situation, by the issuance of a Proclamation to declare that the provisions of Part"
"II of the PSO shall come into operation. It is common ground that, it is the making"
"of  this  declaration  that  is  commonly  referred  to  as  a  declaration  of  a  ‘state  of"
"Emergency’. It is the publication of such a Proclamation on 17th July 2022 that was"
"inter  alia 
impugned 
in  the  proceedings  relating  to  this  Judgment.  The  core"
"submission  made  on  behalf  of  the  several  Petitioners  was  that  the  impugned"
"Proclamation was ultra vires the power conferred on the President (the then Acting"
"President  His  Excellency  Ranil  Wickremasinghe)  by  section  2  of  the  PSO,  read"
"together  with  provisions  of  the  Constitution  and  other  applicable 
law.  The"
"common contention of all learned counsel representing the Petitioners was that as"
"at 17th July 2022, there was no ‘public emergency’ that warranted the issuance of a"
"Proclamation  under  section  2.  Furthermore,  for  multiple  other  reasons  such  as"
"improper motive said to have been entertained by the Acting President and malice,"
"it was submitted that the Proclamation was illegal and had no force of law. The"
"position advanced on behalf of the Attorney General was that the situation which"
"prevailed in the country as at the time the Acting President issued the impugned"
"Proclamation, amply justified his decision to bring into force Part II of the PSO and"
"thereafter promulgate Emergency Regulations published in the Gazette of 18th July"
"2025."
"106) 
As  stated 
in  a  preceding  part  of 
this 
Judgment, 
for 
the  purpose  of"
"determining  the  question  of  law  involved  which  is  intertwined  with  a  complex"
"factual  scenario,  the  Court  needs  to  initially  examine  the  power  vested  in  the"
"President by section 2 of the PSO. Section 2 (following its amendment by Act No."
"8 of 1959) once dissected into its constituent ingredients, appears as follows:"
"W
here, in view of the"
"existence or imminence of a state of public emergency,"
"the President is of opinion that it is expedient so to do"
