Factual matrix

The petitioner filed this fundamental rights application on 08.01.2021,

naming five respondents and seeking declarations that his fundamental

rights enshrined under Articles 11, 12(1) and 13(1) of the Constitution

have been violated by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents, who were police

officers attached to the Crime Branch of the Anuradhapura Police

Station. The petitioner further seeks compensation and costs of litigation.

Upon hearing, this Court granted leave to proceed on the alleged

violations of the petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under

Articles 11, 12(1) and 13(1) of the Constitution by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

respondents.

In their joint statement of objections and corresponding affidavits, the

1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents admit to having arrested the petitioner but

3

SC/FR/365/2020

provide different reasons for the arrest and the manner in which the

petitioner sustained injuries. Their position is that the arrest was lawful.

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents in their affidavits state: The facts

averred by the petitioner are highly inconsistent and misleading and thus

it showcases that this case has been merely instituted with a malicious

intention of defaming the respondents who conducted a lawful arrest.

The petitioner was 24 years old at the time. According to the petitioner,

he was arrested on 03.10.2020 in the village known as Yakalla and

brought to the Anuradhapura Police Station at approximately 1.30 p.m.

He states that he was questioned about a burglary of a shop and, upon

stating that he had no knowledge of such incident, was subjected to

severe torture by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents, along with two other

unidentified police officers, in a room close to the Crime Division of the

Police Station to extract a confession. The petitioner narrates a detailed

account of what took place there. In describing the main act of torture,

he alleges that he was made to sit on the floor, handcuffed with his hands

brought around his legs, and had a large wooden bar passed between his

limbs. He was then hung (suspended) and beaten for approximately two

and a half hours in turns by the said police officers, who insisted that he

confess to the alleged theft. The petitioner maintains that he denied the

accusation as he was not involved in any such crime.

He further alleges that, despite repeatedly requesting water, his requests

were denied during this period. Subsequently, he was taken to the Crime

Division of the police station, where the 1st to 3rd respondents compelled

him to affix his fingerprints and signature on a blank sheet of paper at

approximately 6.45 p.m. Thereafter, he was placed in the police cell. The

petitioner claims that he was not provided with food or water following

his arrest and only received water the next day.

SC/FR/365/2020

The petitioner states that on the following morning, his elder brother,

accompanied by some others, visited the police station. When his brother

inquired about the alleged wrongdoing committed by the petitioner, the

police officers have responded in a threatening manner and told him to

resolve the matter in Court. The petitioners brother has met the

petitioner in the police cell, where the petitioner recounted the brutal

assault he had endured while in police custody for refusing to accept

responsibility for the burglary of a shop. The petitioner also showed his

brother the contusions on his body. The petitioner appeared to be in a

state of severe shock and mental trauma. The petitioners brother has

affirmed these events in an affidavit marked P2.

The petitioners brother lodged a complaint regarding this incident with

the Anuradhapura Branch of the Human Rights Commission on

09.10.2020, as evidenced by document P9.

The following day, the petitioner was taken to the Judicial Medical Officer

(JMO) of Anuradhapura, who advised the police to admit him to the

hospital immediately. The petitioner was examined by the JMO at the

Anuradhapura Hospital at 1.20 p.m. on 04.10.2020, prior to the Acting

Magistrates visit to the hospital for the purpose of remanding him. The

Medico Legal Report (MLR) has been submitted to the Registrar of this

Court. According to the MLR, the history provided by the petitioner to the

consultant JMO is as follows:

2020.10.03 12.30 ,

.

The observations of the consultant JMO are as follows:

1. Rope mark 3 x 1 cm in size placed over lateral aspect right wrist

joint.

2. Rope mark 6 x 1 cm in size placed over medial aspect right wrist

joint.

3. Contusion 17 x 16 cm in size placed over left buttock.

4. Contusion 22 x 18 cm in size placed over right buttock.

5. Contused both soles.

6. Entrapment neuropathy of both hands.

In conclusion, the JMO confirms that Evidence of torture present.

The Acting Magistrate, along with the petitioners lawyer, visited the

petitioner at the hospital, where he was placed in remand custody until

16.10.2020. Surprisingly, according to the B report filed (P6), the

petitioner was arrested with heroin in his possession. However, given the

facts and circumstances of this case, the allegation regarding heroin

appears to be a fabrication intended to justify the arrest and cover up

police torture.

According to the B report, the petitioner informed the Acting Magistrate

that, on the previous day around 2.00 p.m., three police officers had

brought him to the police station under the pretext of recording a

statement about a shop burglary, and he was severely assaulted. When

he became ill, he was taken to the hospital, at which point he was

informed that a heroin-related case had been filed against him.

While the petitioner was hospitalized, his friend, Chandradasa, visited

him around 5.00 p.m. on 05.10.2020. The petitioner recounted the

events that happened at the police station. Chandradasa observed

6

SC/FR/365/2020

contusions on the petitioners body and noted that the petitioner

appeared to be in a state of trepidation and fatigue. Chandradasa has

provided an affidavit, marked P4, attesting to these observations.

At the time, the petitioner was a young man, employed as a driver. His

employer also visited the petitioner at the hospital and has provided an

affidavit, marked P5. The employer observed the shock and fear in the

petitioner and attested that, to the best of his knowledge, the petitioner

had never used heroin, asserting that the allegation of heroin possession

is entirely false.

The petitioner in paragraph 29 of the petition states that while he was

receiving treatment at the hospital, the 1st respondent, accompanied by

two other police officers, visited him and admitted that the arrest was a

mistake. The 1st respondent pleaded with the petitioner not to pursue the

matter further, assuring him that the heroin case would be withdrawn.

The 1st to 3rd respondents in their affidavits have made a general denial

of paragraphs 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 25, 29, 33 and 38 of the

petition, but have not specifically denied this crucial piece of evidence.

After receiving treatment at the hospital for six days, the petitioner was

taken to the Anuradhapura prison, where he remained for 10 days. He

was released on bail on 19.10.2020. In addition to the inhuman assault

he suffered while in police custody, the petitioner was unjustifiably

detained in both police and judicial custody for a total of 16 days, and a

heroin case was also filed against him.

The petitioner states that he received Ayurvedic treatment after being

discharged from custody.

The petitioner complains that the violence he endured took multiple

forms. The police hung him and beat him for hours, kept him starved,

and deprived him of his basic human dignity.

7

SC/FR/365/2020

Human dignity is the basis of human rights, of which fundamental rights

are a species. It is the recognition of human dignity that compels the

protection of fundamental rights, ensuring that individuals are treated

with equality, respect and fairness. By safeguarding these rights, the law

upholds the intrinsic worth of every person, which lies at the heart of a

just and humane society.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United

Nations General Assembly in 1948, stands as the first legal document to

define the fundamental human rights to be universally protected. This is

the foundation of international human rights law including human rights

conventions, treaties and other legal instruments. The Preamble of the

Universal Declaration of Human Rights begins with: Whereas recognition

of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all

members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and

peace in the world. It further states: Whereas the peoples of the United

Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human

rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights

of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and

better standards of life in larger freedom. Article 1 proclaims: All human

beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed

with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit

of brotherhood. The Declaration also contains several additional

references to dignity in its subsequent provisions.

The Preamble to our Constitution assures equality and fundamental

human rights that guarantee the dignity of the People of Sri Lanka.

This underscores the importance of the constitutional value of dignity

in interpreting other rights, including the right to equality, the right not

to be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

punishment, and, by extension, the right to life.

8

SC/FR/365/2020

The petitioner states that he was arrested arbitrarily, without reasonable

suspicion or credible information regarding the burglary of a shop, in

contravention of the law and in violation of Article 13(1) of the

Constitution. He claims that, following his arrest, he was subjected to

torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment,

in violation of Article 11 of the Constitution. He further asserts that when

the police officers failed to extract a confession through torture,

producing him before a Magistrate and remanding him on the wholly false

charge of possessing heroin constitutes a denial of the equal protection

of the law guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Against this overwhelming evidence, what is the defence of the 1st to 3rd

respondents? In the statement of objections and the corresponding

affidavits they state that on that day they along with some other police

officers went to investigate a complaint regarding a theft of a bus and on

their return journey to the police station around 7.00 p.m. they saw the

petitioner close to a place known as Kawarakkulama junction sitting on

a culvert with a bike with no number plates. When the 1st respondent got

down from the police jeep and walked towards the petitioner, the

petitioner suddenly became anxious and tried to run away by pushing

the 1st respondent. While the petitioner was trying to run away, he fell

into the culvert. The police officers jumped into the culvert and struggled

to apprehend the petitioner. There was a brawl between the police officers

and the petitioner, as the petitioner showed immense resistance and

violence. The petitioner sustained injuries as a result. When the 1st

respondent examined the petitioner, a heroin packet was found in the

petitioners trouser pocket. According to the 1st to 3rd respondents, they

did not even question the petitioner on a theft.

This is the version of the 1st to 3rd respondents how the petitioner

sustained injuries. Although the respondents are said to have made great

9

SC/FR/365/2020

efforts to control the petitioner, surprisingly, no injuries were sustained

by the police officers. I am unable to accept this version. It reflects the

standard defence put forward by police officers in cases of police torture.

This account is completely inconsistent with the medical evidence, which

supports the petitioners version of events.

The 1st to 3rd respondents further assert that, in response to the

petitioners allegations of illegal arrest and torture in police custody, the

Senior Superintendent of Police of Anuradhapura instructed the Chief

Inspector of Police of the Anuradhapura Police Station to conduct an

inquiry. The inquiry concluded that the respondents had followed due

process of law and the police officers were exonerated. The 1st to 3rd

respondents place great reliance on this report and marked it as R6. In

this report, prepared by E.M. Sanjeewa Mahanama, Headquarters

Inspector of the Anuradhapura Police Station, the HQI (as I have quoted

below) indirectly questioned the integrity of the consultant Judicial

Medical Officer (JMO) and the police officer who produced the petitioner

to the JMO without obtaining his prior permission. This is, in my view, a

serious matter.

It seems that the HQI Anuradhapura who conducted the inquiry into this

incident condones and encourages the torture and abuse of power by his

subordinate officers who are named as the 1st to 3rd respondents. Such

an attitude on the part of the HQI must be unreservedly condemned.

The standard of proof in a fundamental rights application

In a fundamental rights application, the onus is on the petitioner to prove

his case. This is based on the general principle embodied in section 101

of the Evidence Ordinance that he who asserts must prove:

11

SC/FR/365/2020

Whoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or

liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must

prove that those facts exist.

The standard of proof in a fundamental rights application is the civil

standard, namely proof on a balance of probabilities, as opposed to the

criminal standard of proof, which requires proof beyond a reasonable

doubt. However, within both the civil and criminal standards, there can

be varying degrees of proof, which must be commensurate with the

occasion and proportionate to the subject matter (Bater v. Bater [1950] 2

All ER 458).

Soza J., in Vivienne Goonewardene v. Hector Perera and Others [1983] 1

Sri LR 305, referring to the opinion of Wanasundera J. in Velmurugu v.

The Attorney General [1981] 1 Sri LR 406 stated that the standard of proof

required in cases filed under Article 126 of the Constitution for

infringement of fundamental rights is proof by a preponderance of

probabilities as in a civil case and not proof beyond reasonable doubt.

However, he further elaborated at page 313:

The degree of probability required should be commensurate with the

gravity of the allegation sought to be proved. This Court when called

upon to determine questions of infringement of fundamental rights

will insist on a high degree of probability as for instance a Court

having to decide a question of fraud in a civil suit would. The

conscience of the Court must be satisfied that there has been an

infringement.

In Channa Pieris v. Attorney General [1994] 1 Sri LR 1, Amarasinghe J.

stated at page 107 that having regard to the nature and gravity of the

issue, a high degree of certainty is required before the balance of

probability might be said to tilt in favour of a petitioner endeavouring to

12

SC/FR/365/2020

discharge his burden of proving that he was subjected to torture or to cruel,

inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. At the same page, His

Lordship further remarked:

Would the guarded discretion of a reasonable and just man lead

him to the conclusion? is the test I would apply in deciding the

matter. If I am in real and substantial doubt, that is if there is a

degree of doubt that would prevent a reasonable and just man from

coming to the conclusion, I would hold that the allegation has not

been established.

Article 13(1) violation

Article 13(1) of the Constitution guarantees the freedom from arbitrary

arrest.

No person shall be arrested except according to procedure

established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the

reason for his arrest.

The Article is two-fold in that it requires, firstly, that an arrest may only

be made according to procedure established by law and secondly, that

a person be given reasons for his arrest.

In the instant case, the petitioner was arrested to record a statement for

a burglary of a shop and ended up being charged with possession of

heroin. Persons cannot be arrested according to the whims and fancies

of police officers. A person can only be arrested according to the

procedure established by law. In terms of section 32(1)(b) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No.15 of 1979, a person who has been

concerned in any cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable

complaint has been made or credible information has been received or a

13

SC/FR/365/2020

reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned can be

arrested by a police officer without a warrant.

In order to arrest a person, proof of the commission of an offence is not

required, but mere suspicion of the offence is insufficient. There must be

reasonable suspicion or a reasonable complaint or credible information

of the commission of an offence. The test is objective, as opposed to

subjective. As S.N. Siva C.J. observed in Seneviratne v. Rajakaruna, Sub

Inspector, C.I.D. and Others [2003] 1 Sri LR 410 at 419-420 The wording

in section 32 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act refers to a reasonable

complaint or credible information or a reasonable suspicion. Therefore,

the legislature has been emphatic that a mere suspicion alone would not

be sufficient to arrest a person in terms of section 32 of the Code.

Referring to section 32(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, Dep

J. (later C.J.) in Ven. Dhamarathana Thero and Another v. Sanjeewa

Mahanama and Three Others [2013] 1 Sri LR 81 at 89 stated:

In order to arrest a person under this subsection there should be a

reasonable complaint, credible information or a reasonable

suspicion. Mere fact of receiving a complaint or information does not

permit a peace officer to arrest a person. Police Officer upon receipt

of a complaint or information is required to commence investigations

and ascertain whether the complaint is a reasonable complaint, the

information is credible or the suspicion is reasonable before

proceeding to arrest a person. () Anyone can falsely implicate

another person. A Peace officer should be satisfied that it is a

reasonable complaint.

In Channa Pieris v. Attorney-General (supra), Amerasinghe J. elaborated

on the creditworthiness of the source of information which gives rise to a

reasonable suspicion as follows:

14

SC/FR/365/2020

A reasonable suspicion may be based either upon matters within the

officers knowledge or upon credible information furnished to him, or

upon a combination of both sources. He may inform himself either

by personal investigation or by adopting information supplied to him

or by doing both. A suspicion does not become reasonable merely

because the source of the information is creditworthy. If he is

activated by an unreliable informant, the officer making the arrest

should, as a matter of prudence, act with greater circumspection

than if the information had come from a creditworthy source.

The ulterior motive behind the petitioners arrest by the respondents

becomes apparent upon considering the written complaint (P9) lodged by

the petitioners elder brother with the Human Rights Commission. In the

complaint, he states that following the burglary of his shop, he had

initially lodged a complaint with the Moragoda Police Station. Since no

proper investigation was carried out, the petitioners brother had made a

complaint to the Deputy Inspector General of Police of the North Central

Province requesting a thorough investigation into the matter.

Consequently, the Anuradhapura Crime Division started the

investigation again. At that point, the Anuradhapura Crime Division had

recorded statements from the petitioners mother and brother, upon

which the latter had revealed the names of several individuals whom he

considered suspicious. According to the petitioners brother, one of the

suspicious individuals had falsely implicated the police officers of the

petitioners involvement in the incident. It is abundantly clear that the

respondents have not acted on a reasonable suspicion or a reasonable

complaint or credible information of the commission of an offence.

Aluwihare J. in Ganeshan Samson Roy v. M.M. Janaka Marasinghe and

Others (SC/FR/405/2018, SC Minutes of 20.09.2023) stated:

15

SC/FR/365/2020

Police officers cannot mechanically make an arrest upon a mere

complaint received, without forming the opinion that the allegation is

credible. Thus, a police officer is required to make necessary

investigations, unless the facts are obvious, to verify whether the

complaint is credible or whether the information provided is reliable.

An arrest upon a general or vague suspicion would lead to

significantly abridging the personal liberties guaranteed to a person

by the Constitution.

In Piyasiri and Others v. Nimal Fernando, A.S.P. and Others [1988] 1 Sri

LR 173, H.A.G. De Silva J. observed at 184:

No Police Officer has the right to arrest a person on vague general

suspicion, not knowing the precise crime suspected but hoping to

obtain evidence of the commission of some crime for which they have

the power to arrest. Even if such evidence comes to light the arrest

will be illegal because there will have been no proper communication

of the reason for the arrest to the accused at the time of the arrest.

People cannot be arrested on unfounded suspicion. In the instant case,

there was no justification for the arrest of the petitioner. This is precisely

why he was produced before the Court on an entirely unrelated charge of

possessing heroin, despite having been taken into police custody (based

on the evidence presented before this Court) for alleged burglary. This

also explains why the 1st respondent visited the petitioner at the hospital,

where he was receiving treatment for police assault, to express regret,

claiming it was a case of mistaken identity, and offering to withdraw the

false charge on the condition that the petitioner refrains from pursuing

the matter further. It appears that, during this time, the petitioners elder

brother, who met him while in police custody, had lodged a written

complaint with the Human Rights Commission. The petitioner informed

everyone who met him while he was in custody, including the JMO, that

16

SC/FR/365/2020

he had been severely assaulted by the police on suspicion of shop

burglary. He was not questioned about heroin consumption or addiction

or possession. The introduction of heroin as a convenient means to justify

the arrest, assault, and remanding of the petitioner cannot be condoned.

In Namasivayam v. Gunawardena [1989] 1 Sri LR 394 at 401-402,

Sharvananda C.J. emphasized that the liberty of an individual which is

a matter of great constitutional importance should not be interfered with,

whatever the status of that individual be, arbitrarily and without legal

justification.

Given the facts and circumstances of this case, I take the view that the

petitioner had not been arrested according to the procedure established

by law. Hence, I hold that the 1st to 3rd respondents have violated the

fundamental right of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 13(1) of the

Constitution.

Article 11 violation

Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the

General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948 states:

No one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment or punishment.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) adopted

by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1966 transformed the

rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into treaty

provisions. Sri Lanka acceded to the ICCPR on 11.06.1980. Article 7 of

the ICCPR provides:

No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or

degrading treatment or punishment.

17

SC/FR/365/2020

Regardless of treaty obligations, the prohibition of torture and other

forms of ill-treatment is now a firmly established principle under

customary international law, binding all states.

Article 11 of our Constitution that guarantees freedom from torture

enacts:

No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or

degrading treatment or punishment.

It is significant to note that Article 11 is an entrenched provision with no

restrictions whatsoever. The application of this Article cannot be relaxed

under any condition, even in the interest of national security or during

any other public emergency.

On 10.12.1984, the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the

Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading

Treatment or Punishment. This Convention against torture entered into

force on 26.06.1987. Sri Lanka acceded to this Convention on

03.01.1994, and the Convention entered into force in Sri Lanka on

02.02.1994. This Convention requires signatory parties to take measures

to end torture within their territorial jurisdiction and to criminalize all

acts of torture.

In Article 1 of the Convention against Torture, the term torture is

defined broadly, including both physical and psychological harm:

1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term torture means any

act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental,

is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining

from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing

him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of

having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person,

18

SC/FR/365/2020

or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such

pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the

consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in

an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only

from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.

2. This article is without prejudice to any international instrument or

national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider

application.

Article 2 thereof excludes defences commonly invoked by authorities in

justification of torture:

1. Each State Party shall take effective legislative, administrative,

judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory

under its jurisdiction.

2. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or

a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public

emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.

3. An order from a superior officer or a public authority may not be

invoked as a justification of torture.

Parliament of Sri Lanka enacted the Convention against Torture and

other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act, No.

22 of 1994 to give effect to this Convention. In the interpretation section

of the Act, the term torture is defined in the same manner as in Article

1 of the Convention Against Torture.

torture with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions,

means any act which causes severe pain, whether physical or

mental, to any other person, being an act which is

(a) done for any of the following purposes that is to say

19

SC/FR/365/2020

(i) obtaining from such other person or a third person,

any information or confession; or

(ii) punishing such other person for any act which he or a

third person has committed, or is suspected of having

committed; or

(iii) intimidating or coercing such other person or a third

person; or

(b) done for any reason based on discrimination,

and being in every case, an act which is done by, or at the instigation

of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public officer or other

person acting in an official capacity.

Torture includes not only the infliction of physical pain but also mental

pain, provided the pain inflicted was severe and intentional. Whether an

act constitutes torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

punishment depends on the specific facts and circumstances of each

individual case.

Although the above definition suggests that there must be a nexus

between the act of torture and a purpose enumerated therein, S.N. Silva

C.J. held that it is unnecessary to prove such a nexus, as the plain

meaning of the words in Article 11 does not warrant a qualification being

placed on the word torture by linking it to a purpose. As stated

previously, Article 11 is an entrenched provision and constitutes an

absolute right.

In Velmurugu v. The Attorney General [1981] 1 Sri LR 406 at 453

Wanasundera J. stated as follows:

Article 11 which gives protection from torture and ill-treatment has a

number of features which distinguish it from the other fundamental

rights. Its singularity lies in the fact that it is the only fundamental

20

SC/FR/365/2020

right that is entrenched in the Constitution in the sense that an

amendment of this clause would need not only a two-thirds majority

but also a Referendum. It is also the only right in the catalogue of

rights set out in Chapter III that is of equal application to everybody,

and which in no way can be restricted or diminished. Whatever one

may say of the other rights, this right undoubtedly occupies a

preferred position. Having regard to its importance, its effect and

consequences to society, it should rightly be singled out for special

treatment. It is therefore the duty of this Court to give it full play and

see that its provisions enjoy the maximum application.

Along the same lines, in Amal Sudath Silva v. Kodituwakku [1987] 2 Sri

LR 119, Atukorale J. stated at 126-127:

Article 11 of our Constitution mandates that no person shall be

subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or

punishment. It prohibits every person from inflicting torturesome,

cruel or inhuman treatment on another. It is an absolute

fundamental right subject to no restrictions or limitations

whatsoever. Every person in this country, be he a criminal or not, is

entitled to this right to the fullest content of its guarantee.

Constitutional safeguards are generally directed against the State

and its organs. The police force, being an organ of the State, is

enjoined by the Constitution to secure and advance this right and

not to deny, abridge or restrict the same in any manner and under

any circumstances. Just as much as this right is enjoyed by every

member of the police force, so is he prohibited from denying the same

to others, irrespective of their standing, their beliefs or antecedents.

It is therefore the duty of this court to protect and defend this right

jealously to its fullest measure with a view to ensuring that this right

which is declared and intended to be fundamental is always kept

21

SC/FR/365/2020

fundamental and that the executive by its action does not reduce it

to a mere illusion.

It is often impossible to prove allegations of torture through direct

evidence, as such acts are typically carried out in secrecy.

The difficulty a petitioner in a fundamental rights application would face

if a very high degree of proof were expected by the Court in proving an

allegation of torture was aptly explained by Amerasinghe J. in Channa

Pieris v. Attorney-General (supra) at page 108, who cited the following

passage from the Greek Case reported in the European Court of Human

Rights Decision, Journal of Universal Human Rights, Vol. 1, No. 4,

October-December 1979, page 42, quoted with approval by Sharvananda

J. in Velmurugu v. The Attorney General (supra) at page 438. He stated

that the Supreme Court has been conscious of the difficulties in proving

allegations of torture and stated that it will have regard to the

circumstances of the case, without imposing undue burdens on a

petitioner which might impede access to justice.

There are certain inherent difficulties in the proof of allegation of

torture or ill-treatment. First, a victim or a witness able to corroborate

his story might hesitate to describe or reveal all that has happened

to him for fear of reprisals upon himself or his family. Secondly, acts

of torture or ill-treatment by agents of the Police or Armed Services

would be carried out as far as possible without witnesses and

perhaps without the knowledge of higher authority. Thirdly, when

allegations of torture or ill-treatment are made, the authorities,

whether the Police or Armed Services or the Ministries concerned,

must inevitably feel that they have a collective reputation to defend,

a feeling which would be all the stronger in those authorities that

had no knowledge of the activities of the agents against whom the

allegations are made. In consequence there may be reluctance of

22

SC/FR/365/2020

higher authority to admit or allow inquiries to be made into facts

which might show that the allegations are true. Lastly, traces of

torture or ill-treatment may with lapse of time become

unrecognizable, even by medical experts, particularly where the

form of torture itself leaves...few external marks.

Torturing suspects to extract confessions is often resorted to by some

police officers as an easy method of solving crimes. The publication An X-

Ray of the Sri Lankan Policing System & Torture of the Poor, edited by Basil

Fernando and Shyamali Puvimanasinghe (Asian Human Rights

Commission, 2005), explores various aspects of torture in police custody

and the underlying causes of such conduct by police officers throughout

its chapters. The following factors, inter alia, may contribute to this

malpractice:

(a) Laziness or unwillingness on the part of police officers to conduct

thorough investigations.

(b) Psychological predispositions of certain police officers who derive

satisfaction or a sense of power from torturing suspects.

(c) Lack of proper training in modern investigative techniques.

(d) Insufficient resources, such as forensic tools and technology, to

carry out comprehensive investigations.

(e) Systemic issues such as weak internal disciplinary mechanisms,

absence of effective supervision within the police force, or a

culture that tolerates or implicitly condones the use of torture.

(f) Lack of accountability or lack of fear of consequences for engaging

in torture.

(g) Limited timeframes within which suspects can legally be held in

police custody, creating pressure to obtain results quickly.

(h) Pressure from superiors, the public or media to solve crimes

within an unrealistically short period.

23

SC/FR/365/2020

(i) Desire to gain recognition or approval from superiors by reporting

that suspects were apprehended and they admitted committing

crimes.

(j) Misguided belief among some officers that torture is a reliable or

effective method of extracting truthful confessions, despite

evidence to the contrary, as innocent individuals may falsely

confess to stop the torture.

(k) Personal grudges, biases, or prejudices against particular class of

suspects, leading to abuse of power.

It is significant to note that instances of torture in police custody almost

always involve suspects from marginalized or vulnerable backgrounds,

such as the poor and powerless. Such treatment is unheard of in cases

involving individuals accused of high-profile white-collar crimes or those

with significant social, economic or political influence.

The above list highlights systemic and individual factors contributing to

this unacceptable practice, emphasizing the need for robust reform and

accountability measures.

In the present case, the multiple contusions on the buttocks and soles,

along with neuropathy entrapment, align with the petitioners account of

being assaulted with a bar while suspended. The Medico-Legal Report

prepared by the JMO of Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital confirms the

injuries as indicative of torture, while the diagnostic card attributes the

injuries to police assault. The respondents assertion that the petitioners

injuries were caused during his arrest, allegedly due to his resistance and

a fall into a culvert, is untenable. The petitioners account is

substantiated by medical evidence and supported by affidavits from

individuals who visited him both at the police station and at the hospital.

24

SC/FR/365/2020

I hold that the 1st to 3rd respondents have violated the fundamental right

of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 11 of the Constitution.

Article 12(1) violation

Article 12(1) of our Constitution reads as follows:

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal

protection of the law.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution seeks to guarantee two fundamental

principles of equality: equality before the law and equal protection of the

law. While both principles promote equality and non-discrimination,

equality before the law emphasizes the uniform application of laws,

whereas equal protection of the law emphasizes the uniform application

of legal protections and remedies.

It must also be mentioned that equality before the law and equal

protection of the law cannot be understood or applied in a purely abstract

or strictly literal sense. Not all persons shall be treated alike, but all

persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike. Equality must be

ensured among equals, not unequals. Any attempt to ensure the latter

would defeat the very purpose that Article 12(1) seeks to achieve.

Classification among persons in itself does not violate Article 12(1),

provided that the classification is not arbitrary but founded on an

intelligible differentia and bears a rational nexus to the objective it seeks

to achieve. What Article 12(1) seeks to prevent is unjustified differential

treatment within such classifications. (Palihawadana v. Attorney General

[1978-79-80] 1 Sri LR 65 at 68-69, Wasantha Disanayake and Others v.

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs and Others

[2015] 1 Sri LR 363 at 367, Thilak Lalitha Kumara v. Secretary, Ministry

of Youth Affairs and Skills Development and Others [2015] 1 Sri LR 369

at 376-377)

25

SC/FR/365/2020

In Ferdinandis and Another v. Principal, Vishaka Vidyalaya and Others

(SC/FR/117/2011, SC Minutes of 25.06.2012), Bandaranayake C.J.

explained that, in order to succeed in proving a violation of Article 12(1),

it is necessary for the petitioners to not only establish that they had been

treated differently from others, but also that such treatment was so

different from others who were similarly circumstanced, and there were

no grounds to differentiate them from the petitioners.

Our Constitution has clearly spelt out the concept of equality before

the law and there are numerous instances where that right had been

accepted and upheld. In the process this Court has also noted that

if a person complains of unequal treatment the burden is on that

person to place before this Court material that is sufficient to infer

that unequal treatment had been meted out to him. Accordingly, it is

necessary for the petitioners not only to establish that they had been

treated differently from others, but also that such treatment was so

different as the others were similarly circumstanced and there were

no grounds to differentiate them from him.

However, the contours of the right to equality have evolved over the years.

As Kodagoda J. explained in Wijeratne v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and

Others (SC/FR/256/2017, SC Minutes of 11.12.2020), we have

progressively moved away from the reasonable classification doctrine to

an expansive and more progressive definition of the concept of equality,

founded upon the concept of substantive equality, aimed at protecting

persons from arbitrary, unreasonable, malicious, and capricious executive

and administrative action.

Article 14 of the Indian Constitution is similar to Article 12(1) of our

Constitution. In Indian jurisprudence, the doctrine of equality was

expanded beyond the principle of reasonable classification. In the case of

E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu and Another AIR 1974 SC 555 at 583,

26

SC/FR/365/2020

Bhagwati J. (as he then was) articulated this broader interpretation as

follows:

The basic principle which, therefore, informs both Arts. 14 and 16 is

equality and inhibition against discrimination. Now, what is the

content and reach of this great equalising principle? It is a founding

faith, to use the words of Bose J., a way of life, and it must not be

subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We cannot

countenance any attempt to truncate its all-embracing scope and

meaning, for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude.

Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions

and it cannot be cribbed, cabined and confined within traditional

and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view, equality is

antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are

sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the

other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an

act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to

political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Art.

14, and if it affects any matter relating to public employment, it is

also violative of Art. 16.

In Wickremasinghe v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and Others [2001] 2

Sri LR 409 at 414, S.N. Silva C.J. stated that if executive or administrative

action is reasonable and not arbitrary, it necessarily follows that all

persons in similar circumstances will be guaranteed the equality

enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Although the objective is to ensure that all persons, similarly

circumstanced are treated alike, it is seen that the essence of this

basic standard is to ensure reasonableness being the positive

connotation as opposed to arbitrariness being the related negative

connotation. The application of this basic standard has been blurred

27

SC/FR/365/2020

in later cases due to an overemphasis on the objective of ensuring

that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike. The

case of Perera vs. Jayawickrema (1985) 1 Sri LR 285 demonstrates

the ineffectiveness of the guarantee in Article 12(1) which results

from the rigid application of the requirement to prove that persons

similarly circumstanced as the Petitioner were differently treated.

Such an application of the guarantee under Article 12(1) ignores the

essence of the basic standard which is to ensure reasonableness as

opposed to arbitrariness in the manner required by the basic

standard. If the legislation or the executive or administrative action

in question is thus reasonable and not arbitrary, it necessarily

follows that all persons similarly circumstanced will be treated alike,

being the end result of applying the guarantee of equality. As noted

above, the effectiveness of the guarantee would be minimized if there

is insistence that a failure of the end result should also be

established to prove an infringement of the guarantee. If however

there is such evidence of differential treatment that would indeed

strengthen the case of a Petitioner in establishing the

unreasonableness of the impugned action.

This position was affirmed in later cases such as Kanapathipillai v. Sri

Lanka Broadcasting Corporation and Others [2009] 1 Sri LR 406, Azath S.

Salley v. Colombo Municipal Council (SC/FR/252/2007, SC Minutes of

04.03.2009), Wijesekera and Others v. Gamini Lokuge, Minister of Sports

and Public Recreation and Others [2011] 2 Sri LR 329, Vavuniya Solar

Power (Private) Limited v. Ceylon Electricity Board (SC/FR/172/2017, SC

Minutes of 20.09.2023).

The concept of equality enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution is a

dynamic concept encompassing fairness, justice, and non-

28

SC/FR/365/2020

discrimination, which rejects arbitrariness and promotes

reasonableness.

The practice of police officers introducing drugs to fabricate charges and

validate illegal arrests is evident in the following cases.

In Justin Rajapaksha v. Prasanna Rathnayake (SC/FR/689/2012, SC

Minutes of 28.03.2016), the petitioner was arrested without reason,

assaulted and thereafter produced before the Magistrate on a false charge

of selling cannabis to justify the illegal arrest. De Abrew J. declared:

When the 1st Respondent (HQI, Homagama Police Station) arrested

the petitioner without any reasons and fabricated a false charge

against him, can it be said that he got equal protection of law and

that the 1st Respondent applied the principle that all persons are

equal before the law to the petitioner? This question has to be

answered and is answered in the negative. It is now proved that the

petitioner was arrested and detained in the police station without

any reasons and the charge framed against him was a fabricated

charge. Thus the principle that all persons are equal before the law

and are entitled to the equal protection of law has not been applied

to the petitioner by the 1st Respondent. For the above reasons, I hold

that the 1st Respondent has violated the fundamental rights of the

petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the constitution.

In Liyanagamage Anoma Santhi v. W.A. Mahinda and Others

(SC/FR/135/2017, SC Minutes of 29.09.2022), the petitioner lodged a

complaint at Police Headquarters in Colombo regarding an illegal police

raid. In retaliation, the respondent police officers falsely accused the

petitioner of possessing heroin. This Court held that the arrest and

remanding of the petitioner on fabricated charges violated the petitioners

fundamental rights.

29

SC/FR/365/2020

The acts of the 1st to 3rd respondents in the instant case, including how

they treated the petitioner while in their custody and how he was

unreasonably remanded, apparently on a false charge to cover up the

illegal arrest, are manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable and violative of

the fundamental right of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 12(1) of

the Constitution.

Conclusion

For the aforesaid reasons, I declare that the fundamental rights of the

petitioner guaranteed under Articles 11, 12(1) and 13(1) have been

violated by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd respondents, both individually and

collectively.

With the post-argument written submissions, learned counsel for the 2nd

and 3rd respondents has produced a certified copy of the death certificate

of the 1st respondent to confirm that the 1st respondent died on

03.11.2023 due to a motor traffic accident.

The 2nd and 3rd respondents shall each pay Rs. 100,000 to the petitioner

as compensation within one month from today. Additionally, the 2nd and

3rd respondents shall each pay Rs. 25,000 as costs of the application to

the petitioner within the same period. Accordingly, the petitioner is

entitled to a total sum of Rs. 250,000. The Registrar of the Supreme Court

shall facilitate the due payment of the aforementioned amount.

The Registrar of the Supreme Court is also directed to send a copy of this

judgment to the Chairman of the National Police Commission to make a

note of the attitude of the then HQI Anuradhapura and take appropriate

action as deemed necessary.
