"I hold that the 1st to 3rd respondents have violated the fundamental right"
"of the petitioner guaranteed under Article 11 of the Constitution."
"Article 12(1) violation"
"Article 12(1) of our Constitution reads as follows:"
"All  persons  are  equal  before  the  law  and  are  entitled  to  the  equal"
"protection of the law."
"Article  12(1)  of  the  Constitution  seeks  to  guarantee  two  fundamental"
"principles of equality: equality before the law and equal protection of the"
"law.  While  both  principles  promote  equality  and  non-discrimination,"
"equality  before  the  law  emphasizes  the  uniform  application  of  laws,"
"whereas equal protection of the law emphasizes the uniform application"
"of legal protections and remedies."
"It  must  also  be  mentioned  that  equality  before  the 
law  and  equal"
"protection of the law cannot be understood or applied in a purely abstract"
"or  strictly  literal  sense.  Not  all  persons  shall  be  treated  alike,  but  all"
"persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike. Equality must be"
"ensured among equals, not unequals. Any attempt to ensure the latter"
"would  defeat  the  very  purpose  that  Article  12(1)  seeks  to  achieve."
"Classification  among  persons  in  itself  does  not  violate  Article  12(1),"
"provided  that  the  classification  is  not  arbitrary  but  founded  on  an"
"intelligible differentia and bears a rational nexus to the objective it seeks"
"to achieve. What Article 12(1) seeks to prevent is unjustified differential"
"treatment within such classifications. (Palihawadana v. Attorney General"
