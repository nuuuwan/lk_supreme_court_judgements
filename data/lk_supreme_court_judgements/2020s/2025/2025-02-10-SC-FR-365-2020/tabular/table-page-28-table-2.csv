"assaulted and thereafter produced before the Magistrate on a false charge"
"of selling cannabis to justify the illegal arrest. De Abrew J. declared:"
"When the 1st Respondent (HQI, Homagama Police Station) arrested"
"the  petitioner  without  any  reasons  and  fabricated  a  false  charge"
"against him, can it be said that he got equal protection of law and"
"that  the  1st  Respondent  applied  the  principle  that  “all  persons  are"
"equal  before  the  law”  to  the  petitioner?  This  question  has  to  be"
"answered and is answered in the negative. It is now proved that the"
"petitioner  was  arrested  and  detained  in  the  police  station  without"
"any reasons and the charge framed against him was a fabricated"
"charge. Thus the principle that “all persons are equal before the law"
"and are entitled to the equal protection of law” has not been applied"
"to the petitioner by the 1st Respondent. For the above reasons, I hold"
"that the 1st Respondent has violated the fundamental rights of the"
"petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the constitution."
