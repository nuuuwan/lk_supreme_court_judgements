"Bhagwati J.  (as he then was) articulated this broader interpretation as"
"The basic principle which, therefore, informs both Arts. 14 and 16 is"
"equality  and  inhibition  against  discrimination.  Now,  what  is  the"
"content and reach of this great equalising principle? It is a founding"
"faith, to use the words of Bose J., “a way of life”, and it must not be"
"subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We cannot"
"countenance  any  attempt  to  truncate  its  all-embracing  scope  and"
"meaning,  for  to  do  so  would  be  to  violate  its  activist  magnitude."
"Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions"
"and it cannot be “cribbed, cabined and confined” within traditional"
"and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view, equality is"
"antithetic  to  arbitrariness.  In  fact,  equality  and  arbitrariness  are"
"sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the"
"other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an"
"act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to"
"political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Art."
"14, and if it affects any matter relating to public employment, it is"
"also violative of Art. 16."
