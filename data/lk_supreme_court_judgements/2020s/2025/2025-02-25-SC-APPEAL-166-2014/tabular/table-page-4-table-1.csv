in  evidence  the  Condi(cid:415)ons  of  Contract  between  him  and  the"

"M
/s  Design  Team  Three  (Private)  Limited  [Consultant]  was  the  architect  of  the  said"
"building  and 
in  addi(cid:415)on  to 
its  primary  responsibility  for  the  design,  served  as  the"
"Consultant  to  the  project  and  was  responsible  for  approving  the  payments  due  to  the"
"Contractor."
"T
he total value of the work that was to be performed by the Contractor, as set out in P1"
"was Rs. 24,416,118. Although the evidence does not expressly bear it out, it appears from"
"the reference to a bill of quan(cid:415)(cid:415)es and schedule of rates and prices in P1a that P1 was a"
"measure and pay contract. The Contractor was required to complete the building within"
"a period of 18 months from the date of P1. The Plain(cid:415)ﬀ had paid the Contractor a sum of"
"Rs. 4,892,000, being 20% of the contract sum, as an advance payment for the mobiliza(cid:415)on"
"of the work. The par(cid:415)es had agreed that the said mobiliza(cid:415)on advance shall be recovered"
"by deduc(cid:415)ng 20% from each interim payment made to the Contractor. The par(cid:415)es had"
"also agreed that the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ shall be en(cid:415)tled to retain 10% from each interim payment as"
"reten(cid:415)on money, with the Contractor en(cid:415)tled to the payment of such sums retained only"
"at the end of the defects liability period, which according to P1 was six months from 4th"
"May 1995."
"H
aving  commenced  and  proceeded  with  the  construc(cid:415)on,  the  Contractor  had  faced"
"liquidity  issues  by  early  1995  and  had  suspended  work.  The  Contractor  had  therea(cid:332)er"
"made a request to the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ that a sum of Rs. 1,223,055.92 being the moneys retained"
"as at that point in (cid:415)me in terms of P1 be paid to improve its cash ﬂow thereby enabling it"
"to  re-commence  work.  This  request  of  the  Contractor  had  been  approved  by  the"
"Consultant.  The  Plain(cid:415)ﬀ,  knowing  fully  well  that  releasing  the  said  money  to  the"
"Contractor would result in him losing the control he had over the Contractor in ensuring"
"that  any  outstanding  work 
is  completed  and/or  the  defects  are  remedied  by  the"
"Contractor during the defects liability period, had requested that the said sum be secured"
"by  a  performance  bond.  At  the  request  of  the  Contractor,  the  Defendant  had  issued  a"
"“Combined  Performance  Bond”  on  7th  February  1995  [P4]  for  the  said  sum  of  Rs."
