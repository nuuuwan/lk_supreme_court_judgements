"This brings me to the ques(cid:415)on of whether the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ has sa(cid:415)sﬁed the legal obliga(cid:415)on"
"cast on him of establishing the damages suﬀered by him as a result of the breach of the"
"Contractor."
"Ac(cid:415)on in the District Court"
"O
n 27th March 1996, the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ ﬁled ac(cid:415)on in the District Court of Colombo against the"
"Defendant claiming a sum  of Rs. 1,222,055, which for some unexplained reason is one"
"rupee less than in P4. The case of the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ was that P4 was issued to secure payment"
"of the aforesaid sum of money that the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ had retained as reten(cid:415)on money under"
"P1 and that as the Contractor had failed to complete the works as agreed, the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ had"
"suﬀered a loss amoun(cid:415)ng to Rs. 1,222,055 which the Defendant was liable to pay in terms"
"of  P4.  The  Defendant  ﬁled  its  answer  denying  any  liability  under  P4  and  took  up  the"
"posi(cid:415)on that the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ has not suﬀered any loss or damage and that in any event, the"
"Plain(cid:415)ﬀ has not complied with the condi(cid:415)ons s(cid:415)pulated in P4 that required the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ"
"to make a demand within one month of the default and for ac(cid:415)on to be ﬁled within one"
"month therea(cid:332)er."
"O
f the 11 issues raised by the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ, Issue No. 7 has a direct nexus to the ques(cid:415)on of"
"law raised by the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ before this Court and is therefore re-produced below:"
"“Has  the  Plain(cid:415)ﬀ  suﬀered  loss  and  damage  to  the  extent  of  Rs.  1,222,055,92  in"
"consequence of the default of the contractor?”."
"A
lthough it was sought to be argued before the High Court that mere default on the part"
"of  the  Contractor  would  en(cid:415)tle  the  Plain(cid:415)ﬀ  to  claim  a  sum  of  Rs.  1,222,055  from  the"
"Defendant under and in terms of P4, the above issue makes it clear that the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ was"
"very much aware that he was required to establish that he has suﬀered loss and damage"
"to the extent of the value in P4."
"T
he  Plain(cid:415)ﬀ  gave  evidence  and  led  the  evidence  of  T.P.  Weerasinghe,  the  Managing"
"Director of the Consultant. However, none of the witnesses gave any evidence of the loss"
"or  damage  suﬀered  by  the  Plain(cid:415)ﬀ  as  a  result  of  the  default  of  the  Contractor.  The"
"Defendant did not lead any evidence."
