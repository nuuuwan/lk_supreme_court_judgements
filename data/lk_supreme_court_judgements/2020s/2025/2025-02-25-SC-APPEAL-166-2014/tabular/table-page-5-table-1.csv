"I must perhaps at this stage observe that the aforemen(cid:415)oned sum of money so retained"
"by the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ belonged to the Contractor as these are monies deducted from payments"
"for the work done by the Contractor but retained by the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ as security to ensure the"
"comple(cid:415)on of  outstanding work and/or rec(cid:415)ﬁca(cid:415)on of  any defects in the building that"
"may arise during the defects liability period. Exchanging the moneys so retained with a"
"guarantee  issued  by  a  bank  or  an  insurance  company  is  not  unusual  in  the  ﬁeld  of"
"construc(cid:415)on  as  both  mechanisms,  i.e.,  cash  or  guarantee  not  only  seek  to  assure  the"
"employer [in this case the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ] that any loss suﬀered by him during the defects liability"
"period are well secured but also provides the contractor with the much needed capital"
"and improves its cash ﬂow. Therefore, the iden(cid:415)cal purpose would be achieved, whether"
"it be a cash security or a guarantee equivalent to such amount, provided the employer is"
"able to secure a guarantee that permits him to receive payment on demand."
