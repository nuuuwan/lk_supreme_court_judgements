"","mine)  This  makes  it  abundantly  clear  that  the  legislative  purpose  was  to"
"","create a framework free from any procedural delays usually encountered in"
"","the  Civil  Procedure.  This  legislation  was  brought  about  as  a  response  to"
"","repeated and long-standing concerns by banks that debt recovery litigation"
"","was long, drawn-out, and protracted. The delay in litigation procedure was"
"","contributing  to  the  frustration  of 
institutional  efficiency  and  was  also"
"","compromising the financial stability of banks and the economy of the State."
"","It  is  in  this  context  that  the  Act  vested  the  District  Court  with  special"
"","jurisdiction  in  terms  of  Section  16.  To  permit  appeals  from  preliminary"
"","rulings, 
such  as  orders  on 
jurisdictional  objections,  would 
invite  a"
"","reintroduction of precisely the procedural delays and uncertainties that the"
"","Act was enacted to eliminate."
"[24]","The stand advanced by the Respondent would certainly enable litigants to"
"","segmentize  the  procedure  to  their  convenience,  which  is  contrary  to  the"
"","legislative intent and would undermine the expeditious recovery mechanism"
"","established under the Act. Permitting a right of appeal, in my view, would"
"","erode  the  foundation  of  the  legislative  scope  and  scheme,  reintroducing"
"","uncertainty  and  procedural  confusion,  contrary  to  the  clear  intent  of  the"
"","legislature."
"[25]","Therefore,  the  position  taken  by  the  Respondent  is  unsustainable.  This"
"","Court  is  mindful  that  while  the  judiciary  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  ensuring"
"","justice, it must do so within the bounds of legislative intent. Particularly in"
"","special  enactments  that  create  limited  and  expedited  remedies,  the  Court"
"","must be mindful when expanding the procedural rights that the legislature"
"","has consciously curtailed."
