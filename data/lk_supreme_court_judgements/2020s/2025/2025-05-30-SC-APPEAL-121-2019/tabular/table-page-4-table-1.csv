"[1]","By  Petition  and  Affidavit  dated  30/06/2016,  the  Petitioner-Respondent-"
"","Appellant 
(hereinafter 
referred 
to 
as 
“the  Appellant”)  preferred 
an"
"","Application, in the District Court of Colombo, Case No. DSP 73/16 against"
"","the  Respondent-Appellant-Respondent  (“the  Respondent”), 
in  terms  of"
"","Section 16 of Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of"
"","1990 (as amended)."
"[2]","When  this  matter  was  taken  up  for 
inquiry,  the  Respondent  raised  a"
"","preliminary  question  of  law  to  be  decided  upon  prior  to  the  action  being"
"","taken  up  for  inquiry.  Having  considered  the  pleadings  and  the  written"
"","submissions tendered by the respective parties, the learned District Judge,"
"","by Order dated 16/03/2018, dismissed the preliminary objection raised by"
"","the Respondent and set the matter for Inquiry to decide whether the Order"
"","Nisi issued be made an Order Absolute."
"[3]","Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent preferred an Appeal to"
"","the  Civil  Appeal  High  Court  of  the  Western  Province  exercising  civil"
"","appellate  jurisdiction  holden  in  Colombo  (“the  Appellate  Court”).  In  the"
"","Appeal, the Appellant raised a  preliminary jurisdictional  objection  stating"
"","that no right of appeal lies in terms of Section 16 of Act No. 04 of 1990 (as"
"","amended), since the said statute had not expressly created such a right and"
"","therefore, 
the  Court  had  no 
jurisdiction 
to  hear  and  determine 
the"
"","application."
"[4]","The  Appellate  Court,  after  hearing  and  also  considering  the  submissions"
"","tendered  by  both  parties,  by  Order  dated  19/11/2018,  dismissed  the  said"
"","preliminary objection raised by the Appellant."
