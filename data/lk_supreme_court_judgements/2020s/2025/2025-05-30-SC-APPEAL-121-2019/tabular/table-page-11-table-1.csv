"","procedures. In such instances, the absence of an express right of appeal must"
"","be regarded as a conscious legislative choice to limit appellate interference."
"","Application of Section 16 to Preliminary Objections"
"[17]","I am not inclined to accept the distinction that the impugned order pertains"
"","to  a  preliminary  jurisdictional  objection,  rather  than  to  the  substantive"
"","application for delivery of possession, and therefore lies outside the scope of"
"","the  Act.  It  is  evident  that  the  said  order  was  delivered  in  the  course  of"
"","proceedings instituted under Section 16. This forms an inseparable part of"
"","the statutory procedure provided for by the legislature."
"[18]","A decision on a preliminary objection delivered in the course of a proceeding"
"","under a special statute cannot be considered in isolation or considered to be"
"","independent  of 
the 
jurisdiction  exercised  under 
that  statute.  When  a"
"","Plaintiff  institutes  an  action  in  a  Court,  under  a  particular  statute  which"
"","provides for its procedure, the jurisdiction exercised by the District Court at"
"","all stages of the proceeding will be derived from the jurisdiction conferred"
"","by the Act. Therefore, the nature of the Order, whether preliminary or final,"
"","does  not  change  the  nature  of  the  proceedings  or  confer  a  right of  appeal"
"","when the statute does not provide for such a right."
"[19]","At  this  stage,  I find  it  necessary  to turn  to the legislative intent to  further"
"","clarify the statutory scheme governing Section 16 and to determine whether"
"","a right of appeal should be read into the statute in respect of such orders."
"","Legislative Intent and Statutory Scheme"
"[20]","Although Section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions)"
"","Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended) appears clear in its written text and does not"
"","contain any ambiguity requiring interpretation, the matter before this Court"
