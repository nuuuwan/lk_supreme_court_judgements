"","“At  the  outset  the  Respondent  unequivocally  concedes  that  by  the  said"
"","Judgment dated February 26, 2024 – pronounced in SC Appeals 33/2019"
"","and 34/2019 – Your Lordships’ Court has categorically held that no right"
"","of appeal lies from an Order made under Section 16 of Act No. 4 of 1990 (as"

to"
"","determine  matters arising under  the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special"
"","Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended), and taking into consideration"
"","the findings in DFCC Bank vs. Warnakulasuriya Chandima Prasad and"
"","another1 in its entirety, I see no reason to deviate from the said stand."
"[11]","At the outset, it is important to distinguish between the two questions that"
"","arise in this matter. The first relates to the general issue of whether a right"
"","of appeal exists under Section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special"
"","Provisions)  Act  No.  4  of  1990  (as  amended),  which  has  already  been"
"","addressed and conclusively determined in prior decisions of this Court. The"
"","second,  which  is  more  specific  to  this  case,  concerns  whether,  even  if  no"
"","general right of appeal exists under Section 16, a right of appeal nevertheless"
"","arises in the particular context of this case, where the impugned order was"
"","made on a preliminary objection rather than on the substantive application"
"","for delivery of possession. While the first issue is governed by settled law,"
"","the second requires not only analysis of whether a preliminary order made"
"","during proceedings constitutes an order within the meaning of Section 16,"
"","but also calls for justification through principles of statutory interpretation,"
"","given  that  the  statute  is  silent  on  whether  such  orders  fall  within  the"
"","prohibition on appeals."
