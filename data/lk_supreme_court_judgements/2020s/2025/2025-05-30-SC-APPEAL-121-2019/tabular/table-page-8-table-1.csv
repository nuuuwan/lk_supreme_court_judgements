"[12]","The position insisted upon by the Respondent is that the impugned order"
"","dated 16/03/2018, arising from the instant application is not an order which"
"","was made under Section 16 of Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended), but an order"
"","made  consequent  to  a  preliminary  jurisdictional  objection  raised  by  the"
"","Appellant, which does not amount to an order made under Section 16 of the"
"","Act."
"[13]","In  the  light  of  the  above,  both  parties  agreed  that  this  Court  consider  the"
"","following question of law;"
"","“Can an aggrieved party be entitled to a right of appeal on a preliminary"
"","order made under Section 16 of Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended)?”"
"","Right of Appeal Under Section 16: General Prohibition"
"[14]","Section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4"
"","of 1990 (as amended) reads thus:"
"","“(1)  The  purchaser  of  any  immovable  property  sold  in  pursuance  of  the"
"","preceding provisions of this Act shall, upon application made to the District"
"","Court of Colombo or the District Court having jurisdiction over the place"
"","where that property is situated, and upon production of the certificate of"
"","sale issued in respect of that property under section 15, be, entitled to obtain"
"","an order for delivery of possession of that property."
"","(2)  Every  application  under  subsection  (1)  shall  be  made  and  shall  be"
"","disposed  of,  by  way 
summary  procedure, 
in  accordance  with 
the"
"","provisions  of  Chapter  XXIV  of  the  Civil  Procedure  code  ;  and  on  all"
"","documents

each

"","proceedings  held  thereupon,  stamp  duties  and  other  charges  shall  be"
"","payable at the respective rates payable under any written law for the time"
