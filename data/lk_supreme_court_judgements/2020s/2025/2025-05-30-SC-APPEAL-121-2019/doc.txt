A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

[1] By Petition and Affidavit dated 30/06/2016, the Petitioner-Respondent-

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as “the Appellant”) preferred an

Application, in the District Court of Colombo, Case No. DSP 73/16 against

the Respondent-Appellant-Respondent (“the Respondent”), in terms of

Section 16 of Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of

1990 (as amended).

[2] When this matter was taken up for inquiry, the Respondent raised a

preliminary question of law to be decided upon prior to the action being

taken up for inquiry. Having considered the pleadings and the written

submissions tendered by the respective parties, the learned District Judge,

by Order dated 16/03/2018, dismissed the preliminary objection raised by

the Respondent and set the matter for Inquiry to decide whether the Order

Nisi issued be made an Order Absolute.

[3] Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent preferred an Appeal to

the Civil Appeal High Court of the Western Province exercising civil

appellate jurisdiction holden in Colombo (“the Appellate Court”). In the

Appeal, the Appellant raised a preliminary jurisdictional objection stating

that no right of appeal lies in terms of Section 16 of Act No. 04 of 1990 (as

amended), since the said statute had not expressly created such a right and

therefore, the Court had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the

application.

[4] The Appellate Court, after hearing and also considering the submissions

tendered by both parties, by Order dated 19/11/2018, dismissed the said

preliminary objection raised by the Appellant.

Page 5 of 15

[5] The Appellant is before this Court to have the said Order set aside. By Order

dated 04/07/2019, this Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following

questions of law;

a) Has the High Court erred in law in disregarding and/or failing to apply

the fundamental legal principle that no right of appeal lies unless

expressly conferred by statute, which said legal principle has been

followed in Sri Lanka for almost a century?

b) Has the High Court erred in law in disregarding and/or failing to follow

and apply the case law decided by the Court of Appeal that no right of

appeal has been conferred against an order made under Section 16 of the

Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 (as

amended)?

c) Has the High Court erred in law in failing to judicially consider and/or

misdirected itself in law in applying the case law cited by the Petitioner

which have held that the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions)

Act No: 4 of 1990 (as amended) is a special law and does not provide for

a right of appeal?

d) Has the High Court erred in law in disregarding and/or failing to follow

the principle of stare decisis where the High Court of the Western

Province, Holden in Colombo (exercising appellate jurisdiction), is

bound by the decisions of the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court?

e) Has the High Court Judge erred in law in analyzing the case law and

drawing a distinction between special and ordinary jurisdiction exercised

by the District Court and holding that no right of Appeal exists from an

order made by the District Court exercising unless expressly conferred by

Page 6 of 15

statute and in doing so completely disregarding the case law cited which

specifically held that the District Court exercise special jurisdiction under

the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990

(as amended) which does not confer any right of appeal?

[6] When this matter was taken up for hearing on 04/11/2024, it was brought

to the notice of Court that the questions of law raised in the instant Appeal

are identical to the questions of law raised in Appeals No. SC/App/33/2019

and SC/App/34/2019, and that on the question whether a right of appeal

exist against an order made under Section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by

Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended), this Court on

26/02/2024, has decided that there was no right of Appeal from such an

order of the District Court made under Section 16 of the aforesaid Act.

Accordingly, the said Application for Leave to Appeal had been dismissed.

[7] In the circumstances, when this matter was taken up on 04/11/2024, both

parties agreed to address the question of law, whether a right of appeal exists

against an order made under Section 16 of the Act to finally and conclusively

determine the instant application and to tender written submissions

accordingly.

[8] The Appellant, by motion dated 21/03/2024, placed reliance on the

Judgment dated 26/02/2024, in Appeal Nos. SC/App/33/2019 and

SC/App/34/2019, and moved that the Court take judicial cognizance of the

said Judgment, which has already answered the questions of law applicable

to the instant appeal.

[9] In paragraph 7 of the written submissions tendered by the Respondent, it is

stated that;

Page 7 of 15

“At the outset the Respondent unequivocally concedes that by the said

Judgment dated February 26, 2024 – pronounced in SC Appeals 33/2019

and 34/2019 – Your Lordships’ Court has categorically held that no right

of appeal lies from an Order made under Section 16 of Act No. 4 of 1990 (as

amended)”.

[10] The nature of special jurisdiction conferred in the District Court to

determine matters arising under the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended), and taking into consideration

the findings in DFCC Bank vs. Warnakulasuriya Chandima Prasad and

another1 in its entirety, I see no reason to deviate from the said stand.

[11] At the outset, it is important to distinguish between the two questions that

arise in this matter. The first relates to the general issue of whether a right

of appeal exists under Section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended), which has already been

addressed and conclusively determined in prior decisions of this Court. The

second, which is more specific to this case, concerns whether, even if no

general right of appeal exists under Section 16, a right of appeal nevertheless

arises in the particular context of this case, where the impugned order was

made on a preliminary objection rather than on the substantive application

for delivery of possession. While the first issue is governed by settled law,

the second requires not only analysis of whether a preliminary order made

during proceedings constitutes an order within the meaning of Section 16,

but also calls for justification through principles of statutory interpretation,

given that the statute is silent on whether such orders fall within the

prohibition on appeals.

1 SC/Appeal/33/2019 SC Minutes of 09.02.2023

Page 8 of 15

[12] The position insisted upon by the Respondent is that the impugned order

dated 16/03/2018, arising from the instant application is not an order which

was made under Section 16 of Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended), but an order

made consequent to a preliminary jurisdictional objection raised by the

Appellant, which does not amount to an order made under Section 16 of the

Act.

[13] In the light of the above, both parties agreed that this Court consider the

following question of law;

“Can an aggrieved party be entitled to a right of appeal on a preliminary

order made under Section 16 of Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended)?”

Right of Appeal Under Section 16: General Prohibition

[14] Section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4

of 1990 (as amended) reads thus:

“(1) The purchaser of any immovable property sold in pursuance of the

preceding provisions of this Act shall, upon application made to the District

Court of Colombo or the District Court having jurisdiction over the place

where that property is situated, and upon production of the certificate of

sale issued in respect of that property under section 15, be, entitled to obtain

an order for delivery of possession of that property.

(2) Every application under subsection (1) shall be made and shall be

disposed of, by way summary procedure, in accordance with the

provisions of Chapter XXIV of the Civil Procedure code ; and on all

documents filed the purpose of each such application and on all

proceedings held thereupon, stamp duties and other charges shall be

payable at the respective rates payable under any written law for the time

Page 9 of 15

being in force on applications for, and proceedings connected with, of

incidental to, the execution of a decree of a District Court for the delivery of

possession of any immovable property of the same value as the property to

which such application relates.

(3) Where any immovable property sold in pursuance of the preceding

provisions of this Act in the occupancy of the borrower or some person on

his behalf or of some person claiming under a title created by the borrower

subsequently to the mortgage of the property to the bank the District Court

shall order delivery to be made by putting the purchaser or any person

whom he may appoint to receive possession on his behalf, in possession of

the property.

(4) Where any immovable property sold in pursuance of the preceding

provisions of this Act is in the occupancy of tenant or other person entitle

to occupy the same, the District Court shall order delivery to be made by

affixing a notice that the sale has been taken place, in the Sinhala, Tamil

and English languages, in some conspicuous place on the property, and

proclaiming to the occupant by beat of tom-tom or any other customary

mode or in such manners the court may direct, at some convenient place,

that the interest of the borrower has been transferred to the purchaser. The

cost of such proclamation shall be fixed by the court and shall in every case

be prepaid by the purchaser.

(5) Every order under subsection (3) or subsection (4) shall be deemed, as

the case may be, to be an order for delivery of possession made under

section 287 or section 288 of the Civil procedure Code, and may be enforced

in like manner as an order so made, the borrower and the purchaser being

Page 10 of 15

deemed, for the purpose of the application of any provisions of that Code,

to be the judgment-debtor and judgment-creditor, respectively.”

[15] Section 16(1) of the Act entitles a party to obtain an order for delivery of

possession from the District Court having jurisdiction over the place where

the land is situated, upon production of the certificate of sale. This Court in

DFCC Bank vs. Warnakulasuriya Chandima Prasad and another2,

referred to an order made in respect of Section 16(1) of the Act, where it

stated;

“Under section 16(1), the Court is not expected to have a full trial or full

inquiry and make an order on the merits of the substantive case, if any. The

Court makes a perfunctory order for delivery of possession upon

production of the certificate of sale. The intervention of the Court is sought

at this stage primarily to prevent the breach of peace in the execution of a

non-judicial order.”

[16] As held in, Martin vs. Wijewardena3;

“A right of appeal is a statutory right and must be expressly created and

granted by statute. It cannot be implied. Article 138 is only an enabling

Article, and it confers the jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals to the

Court of Appeal. The right to avail of or take advantage of that jurisdiction

is governed by the several statutory provisions in various Legislative

Enactments.”

This principle applies with even greater force in statutory schemes such as

the present Act, which confer special jurisdiction and provide for expedited

2 ibid 3 [1989] 2 SLR 409, 410

Page 11 of 15

procedures. In such instances, the absence of an express right of appeal must

be regarded as a conscious legislative choice to limit appellate interference.

Application of Section 16 to Preliminary Objections

[17] I am not inclined to accept the distinction that the impugned order pertains

to a preliminary jurisdictional objection, rather than to the substantive

application for delivery of possession, and therefore lies outside the scope of

the Act. It is evident that the said order was delivered in the course of

proceedings instituted under Section 16. This forms an inseparable part of

the statutory procedure provided for by the legislature.

[18] A decision on a preliminary objection delivered in the course of a proceeding

under a special statute cannot be considered in isolation or considered to be

independent of the jurisdiction exercised under that statute. When a

Plaintiff institutes an action in a Court, under a particular statute which

provides for its procedure, the jurisdiction exercised by the District Court at

all stages of the proceeding will be derived from the jurisdiction conferred

by the Act. Therefore, the nature of the Order, whether preliminary or final,

does not change the nature of the proceedings or confer a right of appeal

when the statute does not provide for such a right.

[19] At this stage, I find it necessary to turn to the legislative intent to further

clarify the statutory scheme governing Section 16 and to determine whether

a right of appeal should be read into the statute in respect of such orders.

Legislative Intent and Statutory Scheme

[20] Although Section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions)

Act No. 4 of 1990 (as amended) appears clear in its written text and does not

contain any ambiguity requiring interpretation, the matter before this Court

Page 12 of 15

arises from a different source. The statute remains silent on the procedural

law concerning preliminary objections raised in proceedings instituted

under the Act. This requires the Court to refer to established principles of

statutory interpretation. In circumstances where the statute does not

expressly provide for a procedural right, and permitting such a right may

potentially frustrate the intention of the legislature, it becomes incumbent

upon the Court to interpret the statute in a manner that gives effect to a

purposive interpretation of its intent.

[21] It is well established that courts, when interpreting statutes, should consider

the intent of the legislature. Interpretation of the scope and application of a

statutory provision, particularly in circumstances where the statute is silent

or ambiguous on a material fact, it is both appropriate and useful to refer to

the Parliamentary Hansard Report to ascertain the objectives the legislature

sought to achieve. As held in the landmark case of Pepper vs. Hart4

"The days have passed when the courts adopted a literal approach. The

courts use a purposive approach, which seeks to give effect to the purpose

of legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous material that

bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted."

[22] In this regard, the statement made by the Honorable Minister in the process

of enabling Act No. 4 of 1990 provides a clear insight into the legislative

intent in order to establish a summary and an expedited process for the

recovery of possession, without the delays associated with ordinary

litigation.

The extract from the Hansard reads thus;

[23] As explained by Lord Diplock in Sweet vs. Parsley6 “Purpose connotes an

intention by some person achieve a result desired by him” (emphasis is

5 Sri Lanka, Parliament, Hansard, 23 January 1990, p 1 (Hon D B Wijetunga) 6 [1970] AC 132, 165

Page 14 of 15

mine) This makes it abundantly clear that the legislative purpose was to

create a framework free from any procedural delays usually encountered in

the Civil Procedure. This legislation was brought about as a response to

repeated and long-standing concerns by banks that debt recovery litigation

was long, drawn-out, and protracted. The delay in litigation procedure was

contributing to the frustration of institutional efficiency and was also

compromising the financial stability of banks and the economy of the State.

It is in this context that the Act vested the District Court with special

jurisdiction in terms of Section 16. To permit appeals from preliminary

rulings, such as orders on jurisdictional objections, would invite a

reintroduction of precisely the procedural delays and uncertainties that the

Act was enacted to eliminate.

[24] The stand advanced by the Respondent would certainly enable litigants to

segmentize the procedure to their convenience, which is contrary to the

legislative intent and would undermine the expeditious recovery mechanism

established under the Act. Permitting a right of appeal, in my view, would

erode the foundation of the legislative scope and scheme, reintroducing

uncertainty and procedural confusion, contrary to the clear intent of the

legislature.

[25] Therefore, the position taken by the Respondent is unsustainable. This

Court is mindful that while the judiciary plays a pivotal role in ensuring

justice, it must do so within the bounds of legislative intent. Particularly in

special enactments that create limited and expedited remedies, the Court

must be mindful when expanding the procedural rights that the legislature

has consciously curtailed.

Page 15 of 15

[26] In the circumstances, the question of law stated earlier in this Judgment is

answered in the negative. The impugned Order dated 19/11/2018 is set

aside, and the Application for Leave to Appeal filed in the Civil Appeal High

Court is dismissed.

[27] This Appeal is allowed. The Appellant is entitled to costs in the Civil Appeal

High Court and in this Court.
