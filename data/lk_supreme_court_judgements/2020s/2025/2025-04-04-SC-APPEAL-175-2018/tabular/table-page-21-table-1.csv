"the mere oral statement of the Defendant in evidence, no such agreement had been produced in"
"evidence. Thus, as learned High Court Judges observed there was no evidence to prove such loss."
"On the other hand, when the parties have agreed for a penalty to pay when a delay is caused, as"
"correctly observed by the learned District Judge, a further amount cannot be granted other than"
"that  entitlement. Thus,  the  second  relief  prayed  by  the  Defendant  was  correctly  denied  by  the"
"learned District Judge and High Court Judges."
"Third relief prayed by the Defendant is the arrears of rental based on the Lease Agreement they"
"had previously. As explained above, parties entered into new agreements creating new obligations"
"between the parties and it also  appears that until the full payment  of the balance of the agreed"
"consideration the Defendant consented the Plaintiff to remain in possession creating new license"
"to possess anticipating the transfer of the property. Further, there was evidence to show that the"
"Defendant even executed a deed of transfer. Since there is no sufficient evidence to the satisfaction"
"of the Court to conclude that the parties agreed to pay the lease rental after the lease period ended"
"until the Plaintiff buy the land, this third relief also had to be refused."
"Why a declaration of title cannot be granted in favour of the Defendant has been explained above."
"Thus, the Defendant cannot be granted the 4th relief prayed for in the Answer for declaration of"
"title and the related reliefs No. 5 and 6 for eviction of the Plaintiff and damages based on that also"
"cannot be granted."
"Relief  No.  7  prayed  in  the  Prayer  to  the Answer  pray  for  Rs.  700,000/-  spent  for  putting  up  a"
"parapet wall around the land. No evidence had been led to establish this loss. On the other hand, if"
"the  Plaintiff  put  up  unauthorized  structures  in  the  land  in  dispute,  it  should  be  a  matter  to  be"
"attended through the relevant authority, but no reason has been shown through evidence how such"
"acts make it necessary to put up a parapet wall. This Court cannot see any rational relationship"
"with the alleged delay in paying the balance of consideration and the necessity to put up a wall."
"Hence, the 7th relief also had to be refused."
"Thus, even though this Court may differ in giving reasons on certain matters when compared with"
"the reasons given by the learned District Judge, whose decision was confirmed by the learned High"
"Court Judges, this Court does not see any error in refusing the reliefs claimed by the Defendant."
"In such a situation, this appeal has to be dismissed as the final conclusion of the Courts below to"
"dismiss the Plaint and the Claim in reconvention of the Defendant is correct."
