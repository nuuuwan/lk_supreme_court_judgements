"The learned District Judge was correct in not believing the Plaintiff’s position that she was ready"
"with the money on 05.11.2000, since her own letter marked V2 dated 06.11.2000 indicates that she"
"was ready with only Rs.325,000/- by the date of the letter. However, as per the terms agreed in P2,"
"the agreement does not terminate on not paying the balance amount on the said agreed date which"
"was 05.11.2000. The agreement provides that the balance money could be paid thereafter with a"
"surcharge of Rs.500/- for each and every day of delay of payment. The Evidence show that parties"

"surcharge calculated as agreed in P2."
"Evidence before the learned District Judge on behalf of the Plaintiff was that the Plaintiff came"

"witness that cash for the delay was not brought  on that date. The Defendant’s position was the"
"cheque brought on that date was a third-party cheque, and due to risks she perceived relating to"
"such cheques, she refused to accept the cheque. The learned District Judge found the said refusal"
"to accept the cheque as reasonable on the grounds mentioned below;"
