"notice of Court that the Deed of Transfer referred to in the P2 agreement had not been marked in"
"evidence. This argument is based on the fact that the learned District Judge had answered the issues"
"No. 14 and 15 in the affirmative along with issue No. 16 in favour of the Plaintiff. The said issues"
"raise the question whether a deed of transfer has been executed with regard to the land in dispute"
"and  if  so,  whether  the  Plaintiff  becomes  the  owner  of  the  property  and  as  such  whether  the"
"Defendant can claim a declaration of title to the property."
"It must be noted these issues were not raised at the beginning of the trial but in consequence to the"
"marking of P2 which refers to the execution of a Deed of  Transfer in its Clause No.3 and even"
"after  the  Defendant  admitted  that  fact  in  evidence  on  26.02.2009,  that  he  wrote  a  letter  to  the"
"relevant Notary Public regarding the said Deed of Transfer. The Defendant had not objected to the"
"said issues but had only raised few consequential issues relating to the payment of balance of the"
"consideration and the Plaintiffâ€™s right to pray for the execution of a Deed of Transfer. Once issues"
"are framed the case which the court has to hear and determine becomes crystallized in the issues"
"and the pleadings recede to the background- vide Hanaffi V Nallamma (1998) 1 Sri L R 73. Thus,"
"one cannot blame for learned District for answering the said issues. On the other hand, those issues"
"are framed to find answer to the certain factual situations revealed through evidence and one cannot"
"say that it was to change the scope of the action as Plaintiff has not moved to change the reliefs it"
"prayed for. It was still for an execution of a deed of transfer after accepting the balance payment."
"As said before, after they were allowed to be issues of the court without any objections and invited"
"the learned District Judge to answer them, now at a later stage the Defendant cannot be allowed to"
"say it amounts to change of stance when the answers are against her interests. Then she should"
"have objected to at the first instance when they were framed. On the other hand, whether a transfer"
"deed had already been executed was a necessary finding in interpreting the subsequent agreement"
"named as Agreement to Sell, marked P2, as the Plaintiff was praying for the execution of a deed"
"of transfer."
"Now I would see whether said issues were answered correctly by the learned District Judge. As to"
"whether there had been a deed of transfer executed in respect of the property in issue, it is clear"
"that there had been a deed of transfer executed between parties as it is so stated in Clause 3 of P2,"
"which  was  a  document  signed  by  both  parties  and  which  this  court  decided  above  as  a  valid"
"agreement between the parties as found by the learned District Judge. Further by the document"
