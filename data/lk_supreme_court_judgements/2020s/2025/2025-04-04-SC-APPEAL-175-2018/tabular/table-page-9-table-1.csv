"","reasonable. Thus, it is the Plaintiff who was in breach of the condition that Rs. 425,000/-"
"","was to be paid to the Defendant on or before 03.01.2001."
"•","As  per  the  agreement  marked  P2,  Parties  have  not  intended  to  terminate  the  agreement"
"","merely  on  the  nonpayment  of  Rs.  425,000/-  on  05.11.2000  but  had  agreed  to  pay  that"
"","amount along with Rs. 500/- for each and every day of delay even after that date. Further,"
"","it had been agreed by the parties to send the Deed of Transfer that had already been signed"
"","by the Defendant for registration once the payment is made according to the terms of the"
"","Agreement marked P2."
"•","Even though the agreement marked P2 had been executed naming it as an Agreement to"
"","Sell, as per the said agreement the property had been already transferred to the Plaintiff by"
"","the Defendant and the agreement had been prepared only to set the terms relating to the"
"","balance payment."
"•","The Defendant had falsely taken up a stance in her written submissions to the District Court"
"","that she had signed some blank deeds, but she had never suggested such fact to Lakshmi"
"","Surige, AAL and Notary Public before whom it was executed during her cross examination"
"","and further, she had suggested to the Plaintiff’s witness, Lakshmi Surige, Notary Public"
"","during cross examination that such Deed of Transfer was executed. Going beyond that the"
"","Defendant herself, in her evidence, had admitted the execution of a transfer deed and had"
"","not stated in evidence that she signed a blank deed. The Defendant had further admitted"
"","during cross examination that through letter marked V8, she requested not to send the said"
"","Deed of Transfer for registration until the balance payment is made."
"•","Thus, on 12.09.2000, a duly executed Deed of Transfer had been executed in favour of the"
"","Plaintiff by the Defendant and nonregistration of that would not affect its validity. Since"
"","the  Defendant  had  already  transferred  her  rights  as  at  the  date  of  filing  this  action  the"
"","Defendant is not entitled to a declaration of title to the land."
"•","Even though the Defendant is entitled to Rs. 425,000/ - and a surcharge of Rs. 500/- per"
"","day during the delay of payment, the Defendant had not prayed for that relief in her Answer."
"•","As a deed of transfer had been already executed in favour of the Plaintiff, the Court cannot"
"","grant relief prayed for in the Plaint and the Plaint has to be dismissed."
