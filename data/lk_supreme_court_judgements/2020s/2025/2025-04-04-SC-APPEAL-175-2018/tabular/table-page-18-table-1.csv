"Above position was reiterated by this Court in the recent case of Weerasinghe v. Heling (2020) 3"
"Sri LR 136."
"Mere suspicion that the cheque may not be honoured by the Bank would not established fraud."
"Thus, it is clear once the transfer deed is executed sale of the land takes place unless there is fraud"
"or  misrepresentation.  Existence  of  fraud  or  misrepresentation  was  never  suggested  to  the  said"
"Notary Public while she was under cross examination. P2 agreement itself shows that the idea was"
"to execute the deed of transfer on the same date and to keep it without registration till the balance"
"of consideration is paid. Thus, a transfer had taken place and the only remedy for the Defendant"
"was to file an action for the balance of consideration if it was not paid. Furthermore, the Defendant"
"herself had admitted in evidence that she signed a deed of transfer– vide page 267 of the brief."
"What is admitted need not be proved."
"Hence on balance of probability, there was sufficient evidence for the learned District Judge to"
"hold that a Deed of Transfer had been executed in relation to the land in dispute along with the"
"agreement marked P2. As said before it was a necessary finding in interpreting P2. Thus, answering"
"issue No. 14 framed before the District Court in the affirmative was correct. However, it is apparent"
"that even though there was evidence to show that a deed of transfer was executed, there was no"
"clear  admission  found  through  evidence  as  to  the  ownership  of  the  land  as  the  Defendant  was"
"claiming for a declaration of title."
"The issue No. 15 framed before the learned District Judge was focused on a finding to the effect"
"that if the issue No. 14 was answered in the affirmative whether the Plaintiff is the owner of the"
"land in dispute. It is true that as per the evidence led, the Plaintiff appears to be the one who bought"
"the  land  in  dispute  by  the  aforesaid  Deed  of Transfer  referred  to  in  the  agreement  marked  P2."
"However, whether it is the Plaintiff who was the vendee in the said Deed of Transfer is part of the"
"contents of the said deed, contents of a document have to be proved by leading primary evidence."
"No evidence was before the learned District Judge to say that, in that regard, secondary evidence"
"could have been accepted in terms of Sections 65 and 66 of the Evidence Ordinance. Had it been"
"produced in evidence, a party could have been able to challenge its due execution etc. Thus, in my"
"view the learned District Judge should not have answered the issue No. 15 in the affirmative but"
"should have answered as “not proved by producing primary evidence”. It is important to note that"
"even  though  the  document  marked  P2  is  named  as  an Agreement  to  Sell,  the  document  itself"
