"The questions of law allowed by this Court are as follows;"
"A. Did the High Court of Civil Appeals and the District Court fail to appreciate the precise nature"
"of the cause of action, especially paragraphs 14,16 and 18 of the Plaint, read with prayers (a) and"
"(b) thereof, which unequivocally and unambiguously demonstrate that the cause of action of the"
"Respondent was to primarily obtain a judgment for specific performance of the Agreement to Sell,"
"produced marked P2?"
"B. Did the High Court of Civil Appeals and the District Court fail to appreciate that in the prayer"
"to  the  plaint,  what  the  respondent  sought  was  specific  performance  of  the  Agreement  to  Sell,"
"produced marked P2 or in the alternative, for the petitioner to repay to the respondent, the part"
"payments that had been already made by the respondent?"
"C. Did the High Court of Civil Appeals and the District Court fall into serious error by failing to"
"appreciate that the prayer to the plaint, was clearly incompatible with any character of ownership"
"of the corpus in suit?"
"D. Did the High Court of Civil Appeals and the District Court fall into serious error by holding"
"that the transfer deed had already been executed in favour of the Respondent, when in fact, very"

"being misled by the naming of the agreement or by thinking that a transfer of title is perfected only"
"when the consideration is paid and not when the deed of transfer is executed. Thus, she filed an"
"action for purported specific performance to execute a deed of transfer when there is no clause in"
"P2 that provides to execute a deed of transfer once the balance of consideration is paid. It only"
"provides to send the deed of transfer already executed for registration. What the Plaintiff could"
"have prayed in terms of P2 was an order directing the Defendant to accept the balance payment or"
"to deposit it in Courts in favour of the Defendant so that he could get the deed of transfer referred"
"to  in  P2  registered.  Instead,  she  prayed  for  an  execution  of  a  deed  of  transfer  which  is  not"
"contemplated in P2 as it has already been done. Thus, the Plaintiffâ€™s action should fail as it was"
"filed on a wrong premise. In that backdrop, I do not think that the learned Judges of courts below"
"failed to appreciate the precise nature of the prayers of the Plaint, but they appreciate the nature of"
"the prayers to the Plaint, but found that those prayers cannot be based on P2 in accordance with"
