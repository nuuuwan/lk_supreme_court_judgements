"Lakshmi  Surige,  Notary  Public.  However,  it  cannot  be  expected  to  be  tendered  through  the"
"Plaintiffâ€™s witnesses as marking it was obnoxious to the stance taken by the Plaintiff that she has"
"a right to get a deed of transfer executed. As it is the Defendant who prayed for a declaration of"
"title, it is she who must prove title. Due to the availability of evidence to show that there is a deed"
"of transfer executed by her, it is she who must prove that there is no such valid transfer for her to"
"get a declaration of title in her favour."
"It appears that the Defendant filing her Answer had attempted to rely on the clauses of the Lease"
"Agreement that existed between them. It is clear that after the lease period parties willingly subject"
"themselves to  the P1 and P2 agreements  (Agreements termed as Agreements  to  Sell) and thus,"
"entered  into  a  new  relationship  and  new  obligations. As  said  before  none  of  these  agreements"
"contain a clause to say that the Plaintiff should pay the lease rental or an amount similar to that till"
"the total consideration to buy the land is paid. Hence, these documents do not show that the parties"
"intended to continue with the clauses in the Lease Agreement until the full consideration of the"
"sale of land is paid. Instead, in the subsequent agreement marked P2, it is visible that the Plaintiff"

"consent of the Defendant indicating that new license to possess the land anticipating the payment"
"of balance of the consideration for the sale of the land was created through such consent- vide"
"pages  204,  208  of  the  brief.  In  that  context,  it  cannot  be  presumed  that  the  parties  intended  to"
"continue with the terms of the Lease Agreement after they entered into P1 and P2 as they entered"
"into new obligations without any reference to continuation of previous obligations."
"In the above backdrop, now I would consider whether any of the relief prayed by the Defendant in"
"her prayer could have been granted by the learned District Judge."
"The learned District Judge had dismissed the Plaint. As said before, the Plaint had been filed on a"
"wrong premise as such said dismissal should stand. Thus, the 1st relief prayed in the Answer had"
"been granted even though it was seemingly given on different grounds."
"The second relief prayed in the Answer is based on the alleged fact that the Defendant entered into"
"an agreement with another person to buy a land but failed to buy it due to the failure of the Plaintiff"
"to pay the balance as agreed, which caused a loss of Rs. 200,000/- to the Defendant. Other than"
