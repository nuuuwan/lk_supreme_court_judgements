"marked V6, the Notary had agreed not to send them to registration and as per the letter marked V8,"
"dated 06.11.2000, the Defendant had asked the Notary to return the said Deed of Transfer to her"
"as P2 was terminated on 05.11.2000 on the ground that the agreement was not fulfilled, impliedly"
"admitting that there is a deed of transfer executed in relation to the land in dispute. As said before,"
"P2 did not terminate on 05.11.2000 as there was a clause which enable the Plaintiff to tender the"
"balance of the consideration along with a surcharge of Rs. 500/- per each and every day of delay"
"in paying the balance of consideration for the Deed of Transfer. Even though the Defendant took"
"up  the  position  that  she  signed  blank  documents  before  Lakshmi  Surige,  Notary  Public  in  her"
"written  submissions  to  the  District  Court  (vide  paragraph  20  of  the  written  submissions  to  the"
"District Court), the Defendant never suggested that she signed blank documents before said Notary"
"when the said Notary gave evidence. If she signed blank documents, it is difficult to comprehend"
"how  she  named  them  as  a  printed  deed  of  transfer  in  V8  and  request  not  to  send  them  for"
"registration. If she signed blank documents, she should have naturally said about signing blank"
"documents in V8. Aforesaid Notary Public, Lakshmi Surige while giving evidence had clearly said"
"in evidence that to have more reliability (may be with regard to the transaction) she got the transfer"
"deed  executed  on  the  same  date.  Whatever  was  her  intention  a  transfer  deed  had  been  signed"
"according to her evidence- vide page 227 of the brief. The Notary Public, Lakshmi Surige, had"
"again clearly stated that a deed of transfer was executed but it was not sent for registration as the"
"balance amount was not paid- vide page 237 of the brief. It is true that at one point the said Notary"
"had expressed the view that sale was not done but the deed was signed and it was to be sent for"
"registration only after the payment of Rs. 425,000/-. In this regard I prefer to quote the following"
"authorities."
"In Jayawardene Amerasekera 15 N L R 280 Lascelles C J held as follows:"
"“On the execution of a notarial conveyance the sale is complete, and the mere fact that whole of"
"the consideration has not been paid cannot, in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation, afford"
"ground for the rescission of the sale and the cancellation of the conveyance.”"
"In Mohamadu V Hussim 16 N L R 368 Pereira J held as follows:"
"“Where  a  person  obtains  a  conveyance  of  property  without  fraud,  but  afterwards  fraudulently"
"refuses to pay the consideration stipulated for, the grantor is not entitled to claim a cancellation"
"of the conveyance, but his remedy is an action for the recovery of the consideration.”"
