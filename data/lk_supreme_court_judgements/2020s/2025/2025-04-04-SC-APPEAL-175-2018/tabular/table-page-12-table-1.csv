"not follow the provisions in section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance. Thus, only objection"
"to  the  enforceability  of  P2,  the  subsequent Agreement  to  Sell  entered  before  Lakshmi  Surige,"
"Notary Public was raised on the basis that the Notary did not follow the provisions in the Notaries"
"Ordinance. As per the stance of the Defendant it is so objected stating that the Notary Public has"
"not included her attestation clause as to the due execution in terms of the Notaries Ordinance."
"In this regard, it is observed that the learned trial Judge has correctly followed the decision of the"
"Supreme  Court  in  Thiyagarasa  vs. Arunodayam  (1987)  2  Sri  LR  184  which  also  quoted  the"
"decision in Kiribanda V Ukkuwa (1892)1 S C R 216 and E R S R Coomaraswamy from The"
"Conveyancer and Property Lawyer Vol.1, part 1 and held that;"
"“ I accordingly hold that once it is established that the requirements of section 2 of the Prevention"
"of Frauds Ordinance relating to the execution of the deed have been complied with, the mere fact"
"that the notary has inserted a false or wrong date of its execution does not render the deed void."
"The lapse on the part of the notary does not touch the validity of the deed but may render the notary"
"liable to be prosecuted for contravention of the provisions of the Notaries Ordinance. This seems"
"reasonable and just for the parties to the transaction have no control over the act of the notary"
"who is a professional man. I am therefore of the opinion that P3 is valid and effective to transfer"
"the legal title to the property and is not bad for want of due execution.”"
"The portion quoted in the said judgment from The Conveyancer and Property Lawyer also read"
"as  follows  “The  Notaries  Ordinance  requires  the  notary  attesting  a  deed  to  append  a  formal"
"attestation to the deed. The absence of this attestation clause will not invalidate the deed but will"
"render the notary liable to a statutory penalty…… Only the formalities required by section 2 (of"
"the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance) are absolutely essential. If these requirements are fulfilled"
"the failure to observe the other requirements of the Ordinance or any other Ordinance, such as the"
"Notaries Ordinance, will not invalidate the deed.”"
"De Sampayo J. in Weeraratne vs. Ranmenike (1919) 21 NLR 286. at p. 287-288 stated that “It"
"is well settled that a notary’s failure to observe his duties with regard to formalities which are not"
"essential to due execution, so far as the parties are concerned, does not vitiate a deed. For instance,"
"the absence of the attestation clause does not render a deed invalid.”."
