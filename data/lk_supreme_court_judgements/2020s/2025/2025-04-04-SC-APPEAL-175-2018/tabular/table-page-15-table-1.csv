"The learned District Judge failed to consider that the reference to Rs. 500,000/- paid by a cheque"
"in Plaintiff’s evidence may be a mistake as a payment of Rs. 600,000/- had been made previously"
"by a cheque. I cannot understand how the District Judge came to the conclusion that Plaintiff was"
"not truthful as to the issuer of cheque on the said facts that one cheque was a Commercial Bank"
"cheque  and  the  other  was  a  People’s  Bank  cheque.  The  previous  cheque  indicates  that  the"
"Defendant accepted payment by cheques on previous occasion. As Plaintiff had stated that she did"
"not  have  an  account  to  issue  cheque,  the  previous  cheque  also  would  have  been  a  third-party"
"cheque. Whether it was a cheque issued by her son or a different third party, the learned District"
"Judge failed to  consider  that a cheque is  a negotiable instrument  drawn on a banker to  pay  on"
"demand. The learned District Judge further failed to consider that it is presumed that holder of a"
"cheque  becomes  the  holder  in  due  course  and  a  cause  of  action  could  only  be  accrued  to  the"
"Defendant  against  the  Plaintiff  only  if  the  bank  dishonours  the  cheque.  Hence,  I  doubt  the"

"surcharge  calculated  in  terms  of  the  agreement  marked  P2. As  learned  District  Judge  correctly"
"found there was no prayer claiming that amount in the Answer. It must be noted here that even if"
"the Defendant is the one who breached the agreement by not accepting the balance payment made"
"by a cheque, the Plaintiff’s action had to be dismissed as it was filed on the wrong premise to get"
"an order to execute a deed of transfer in relation to the property involved when the P2 agreement"
"clearly indicate that the Deed of Transfer was executed along with the said agreement but it can be"

"a deed of transfer when the balance money is paid. Thus, the learned District Judge was correct in"
"saying that even though P2 is named as an Agreement to Sell, it was merely an agreement as to the"
