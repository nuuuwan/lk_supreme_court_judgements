has the qualifying event been sufficiently identified?"
"[41]","The  Bonds  in  question  marked  P6  and  P9,  are  termed  as  Performance  Bonds."
"","Whatever  the  terms  used,  ‘Performance  Bond,’  Demand  Bond,’  ‘Performance"
"","Guarantee’  and 
‘Demand  Guarantee’  can  be  used 
interchangeably  and  are"
"","recognized in law as such. The said interchangeability was appreciated in Edward"
"","Owen Engineering Ltd. v. Barclays Bank International Ltd10, where Lord Denning"
"","MR began his judgment by stating:"
"","“This case concerns a new business transaction called a performance guarantee or"
"","a performance bond.”"
"[42]","A Performance Bond generally takes the form of a demand guarantee, where liability"
"","is triggered by a demand in the form of a statement that the applicant is in breach of"
"","its obligations under the underlying relationship."
"[43]","As  discussed  earlier  in  this  judgment,  upon  the  beneficiary's  assertion  that  the"
"","Contractor  has  failed  in  the  due  and  punctual  performance  and  fulfilment  of  the"
"","contract, the Defendant is obliged to make payment to the Obligee. On its proper"
"","construction, the Performance Bonds are payable on demand. As in P6 and P9, when"
"","the breach of contract by the Contractor and the payment obligation by the Obligee"
"","is expressed in plain terms, the banker ‘must and should’ pay on first demand."
"[44]","Where an instrument contains an undertaking to pay ‘on demand’ (with or without"
"","the words ‘first’ and/or ‘written’); and does not contain clauses excluding or limiting"
"","the defences available to a surety; ‘it will almost always be’ construed as a demand"
