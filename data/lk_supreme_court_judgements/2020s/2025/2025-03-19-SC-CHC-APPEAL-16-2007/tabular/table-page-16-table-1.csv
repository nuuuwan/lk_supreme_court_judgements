"","the  Contractor  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Performance  Bonds  or  any"

"","‘Autonomous nature’ of a demand guarantee"
"[51]","As pointed out earlier, the Defendant Bank submitted that the Plaintiff should limit"
"","itself to the actual loss and damages suffered as a result of the breach of contract"
"","therein,  underlining  the  importance  of  the  contractual  relationship  between  the"
"","parties. When the Defendant asserts that the Plaintiff has not taken steps against the"
"","Contractor prior to seeking relief from the Defendant, it is in fact, questioning the"
"","‘autonomous nature’ of a demand guarantee."
"[52]","The difference between a traditional guarantee (suretyship) and a demand guarantee"
"","lies in the nature of the liability. In a traditional guarantee, the surety’s liability is"
"","secondary  and  dependent  upon  the  principal  debtor’s  default.  The  creditor  must"
"","prove such default to enforce the surety’s liability."
"[53]","In  contrast,  a  demand  guarantee  creates  a  primary  obligation  for  the  issuer  (the"
"","Defendant  Bank  in  this  case),  which  is  triggered  solely  by  a  demand  from  the"
"","beneficiary, regardless of disputes between the beneficiary and the principal debtor."
"","The  demand  guarantee  operates  autonomously 
from 
the  underlying  contract,"
"","meaning the guarantor is detached from disputes or claims arising from that contract."
