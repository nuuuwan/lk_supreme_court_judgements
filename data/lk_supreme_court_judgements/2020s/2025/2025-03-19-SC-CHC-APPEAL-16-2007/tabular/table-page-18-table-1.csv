"","In Edward Owen Engineering Ltd. v. Barclays Bank International Ltd16."
"","It was held that “All this leads to the conclusion that the performance guarantee"
"","stands on a similar footing to a letter of credit. A bank which gives a performance"
"","guarantee must honor that guarantee according to its terms. It is not concerned in"
"","the  least  with  the  relations  between  the  supplier  and  the  customer;  nor  with  the"
"","question whether the supplier has performed his contractual obligation or not; nor"
"","with  the  question  whether  the  supplier  is  in  default  or  not.  The  banker  must  pay"
"","according to its guarantee, on demand, if so stipulated, without proof or conditions."
"","The only exception is when there is a clear fraud of which the bank has notice”"
"[58]","In the words of Kerr J. in R. D. Harbottle (Mercantile) Ltd. v. National Westminster"
"","Bank17,  cited  with  approval  by  Lord  Denning  MR. 
in 
the  above-mentioned"
"","judgement, “…the machinery and commitments of banks are on  a  different  level."
"","They must be allowed to be honored free from interference from courts. Otherwise,"
"","trust in international commerce could be irreparably damaged.”"
"[59]","In Hydrabad Industries ltd. v Idac Trading (Pvt) Ltd and two others18 it was held"
"","that"
"","“…A confirmed letter  of credit  constitutes a  bargain between the banker and the"
"","vendor  of  goods,  which  imposes  on  the  banker  an  absolute  obligation  to  pay"
"","irrespective of any dispute which there may be between the parties on the question"
"","whether the goods are up to contract or not. An elaborate commercial system has"
"","been built up on the footing that bankers’ confirmed credits are of that character,"
"","and it would be wrong for the court to interfere with that established practice. The"
"","system  of  financing  these  operations  would  break  down  completely  if  a  dispute"
"","between the vendor and the purchaser were to have the effect of ‘freezing’ the sum"
"","in respect of which the letter of credit was opened. The court’s jurisdiction to grant"
"","injunctions  is  wide,  but  this  is  not  a  case  in  which,  in  the  exercise  of  the  court’s"
"","discretion, it ought to grant an injunction.”"
