"","M/T and 150 M/T of Triple Laminate Foil to Lanka Milk Foods (CWE) Ltd."" The"
"","demand  was  signed  by  authorised  signatories,  i.e.  the  Directors  authorised  by  a"
"","Board resolution (marked P17) and the Finance Manager."
"[34]","In proceedings before the trial court, the position of the Defendant Bank was that"
"","the signatures placed in the demand marked P7, were not by authorised signatories"
"","and therefore had no legal validity in terms of the law. However, a Board resolution"
"","passed  by  the  Plaintiff  Company  with  the  authorised  signatures  was  tendered  in"
"","evidence marked P17. It is noted that the Defendant Bank at no stage of the trial,"
"","contested the validity of the said Resolution marked P17."
"[35]","The said Resolution (P17), has authorised and mandated persons named therein, to"
"","act on instructions regarding any accounts or transactions of the Plaintiff Company."
"","It provided that “one of the two signatories should be the Acting Finance Manager"
"","and only in his absence any two of the other persons” named are authorised to sign"
"","on behalf of the Plaintiff Company. It is in evidence that when P7 demand/call was"
"","made, the Defendant Bank never took up the position that the signatures placed were"
"","not by authorised signatories."
"[36]","Having considered the objections raised by the Defendant Bank and the facts and"
"","circumstances referred to above, the learned Judge of the Commercial High Court"
"","concluded  that  “the  objection  raised  by  the  Defendant  regarding  the  purported"
"","requirement of the demand having to be signed by an authorised signatory in my"
"","opinion, merits no consideration.” I too see no reason to depart from that stand."
"","Quantifying damages"
"[37]","During cross-examination, it was suggested to the Plaintiff’s witness that ""a claim"
"","on  a  Performance  Bond,  regardless  of  its  value,  is  limited  to  the  actual  damages"
"","suffered."" The Defendant's position was that the beneficiary had failed to quantify"
"","the damages incurred  due to the Contractor’s actions before lodging the claim. It"
"","was  also  the  position  of  the  Defendant,  that  if  there  were  defects  in  the  goods"
