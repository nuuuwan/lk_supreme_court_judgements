"","supplied, the beneficiary should have availed himself to institute an action against"
"","the Contractor or referred the matter to Arbitration."
"[38]","Responding to the above, the Plaintiff’s position was that due to the deficiency in"
"","delamination, the loss caused to the Plaintiff was around 17% of the contract value"
"","and that this action was filed to sue the banker on the Performance Bond and not on"
"","the contract entered with the Contractor."
"","The quantification of damages shall be discussed in detail in the latter part of this"
"","judgement."
"","Are  the  Performance  Bonds  ‘On  Demand’  guarantee  Bonds  or  ‘Conditional"
"","Bonds’"
"[39]","The 
learned  President’s  Counsel 
for 
the  Defendant  Bank  argued 
that 
if  a"
"","Performance Bond is to be construed as an ‘on demand’ Bond, it requires extremely"
"","clear wording, and Performance Bonds P6 and P9 do not qualify as such. The Court’s"
"","attention was drawn to the term:"
"","“That the contractor has failed in the contractual obligations then and in that case"
"","to make payment to the oblige sum of …”"
"","It  was  submitted  that  the  phrase  “then  and  in  that  case”  makes  the  payment"
"","conditional,  requiring  the  Plaintiff  to  first  obtain  an  adjudication  that  Wong  Ji"
"","Industrial (the contractor) is in breach of contract prior to seeking relief from the"
"","Defendant under the contested Bonds."
"[40]","Regarding  P6  and  P9,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Defendant  Bank"
"","further submitted that no proper claim or call was made. He argued that P6 and P9"
"","require  the  Plaintiff  to  make  an  independent  claim  through  a  statement  that  the"
"","Contractor is in breach. It was emphasized that the precise terms of the Bond must"
"","be strictly followed when making a claim or call under it."
"","In my view, this position raises two key questions."
