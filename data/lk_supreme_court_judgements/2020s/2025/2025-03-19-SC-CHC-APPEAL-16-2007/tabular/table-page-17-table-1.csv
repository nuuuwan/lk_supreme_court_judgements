"[54]","The principle of autonomy is reflected in Article 5(a) of the International Chamber"
"","of Commerce (ICC) Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG), which states:"
"","“A  guarantee  is  by  its  nature  independent  of  the  underlying  relationship  and  the"
"","application,  and  the  guarantor  is  in  no  way  concerned  with  or  bound  by  such"
"","relationship.  A  reference  in  the  guarantee  to  the  underlying  relationship  for  the"
"","purpose of identifying it does not change the independent nature of the guarantee."
"","The undertaking of a guarantor to pay under the guarantee is not subject to claims"
"","or  defenses  arising  from  any  relationship  other  than  a  relationship  between  the"
"","guarantor and the beneficiary.”"
"","Paget’s Law of banking15, referring to a number of decided UK case laws observes"
"","that;"
"","“It  is  hoped  that  the  revised  URDG  are  to  be  incorporated  into  more  demand"
"","guarantee contracts worldwide.”"
"[55]","A Guarantor can challenge the validity of an instrument by asserting fraudulent"
"","conduct or misrepresentation by the beneficiary. In such instance the Guarantor"
"","may decline payment when a sufficient case of fraud is made out, entitling the"
"","Guarantor to refuse to honor the guarantee. However, in this case, no such"
"","allegation of fraud was pleaded or led in evidence by the Defendant Bank."
"[56]","However,  if  a  Beneficiary  claims  more  than  they  are  entitled  to  under  a  demand"
"","guarantee, there is an implied obligation for them to repay the excess amount to the"
"","principal. This duty applies even if the principal has already reimbursed the bank."
"","The repayment obligation arises once the overpayment amount is determined, either"
"","by agreement or a court ruling, and must be dealt with in a separate suit."
"[57]","Regarding  the  legal  position  on  bank  guarantees,  the  Plaintiff,  in  their  written"
"","submissions  to  the  Commercial  High  Court  and  this  Court,  cited  several  decided"
"","cases from the UK and Sri Lanka."
