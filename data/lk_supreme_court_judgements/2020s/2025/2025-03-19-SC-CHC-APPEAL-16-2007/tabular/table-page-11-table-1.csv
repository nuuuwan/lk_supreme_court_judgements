"[31]","In 
terms  of 
the  above  provisions, 
the  Defendant  Bank,  by 
its  conduct  has"
"","unequivocally acquiesced to the vesting order and was in control of the financial"
"","affairs  of  BCCI,  including  its  contractual  obligations. Assuming  authority  in  the"
"","banking  business  of  BCCI,  it  benefited  from  the  transfer  of  assets  while  also"
"","becoming responsible for its liabilities. The Defendant Bank did not challenge the"
"","validity  of  the  vesting  order  at  the  time  of  its  execution.  It  is  observed  that  the"
"","objection to the validity of the vesting order is taken up for the first time when sued"
"","for default of its contractual obligations."
"[32]","Moreover, the principle of estoppel by conduct prevents a party from accepting the"
"","benefits of a legal order while simultaneously repudiating its obligations. I find that"
"","the Defendant Bank is estopped from denying its liabilities and shall be bound by"
"","its obligations arising out of the vesting order. By accepting the vesting order and"
"","acting upon it, the Defendant Bank is precluded from denying its liabilities arising"
"","from the said performance bonds."
