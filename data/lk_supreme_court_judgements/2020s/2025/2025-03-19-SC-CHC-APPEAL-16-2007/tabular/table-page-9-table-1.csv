"[23]","The Court also emphasized that the existence of such a state of emergency is not a"
"","justiciable  matter  that  the  courts  be  called  upon  to  determine  by  applying  an"
"","objective test. This principle was consistently upheld and more fully emphasized in"
"","Weerasinghe  v.  Samarasinghe2,  Bank  of  Ceylon  v.  Bogala  Graphite3,  Janatha"
"","Finance and Investments Ltd. v. Liyanage and others4."
"[24]","As  established  in  the  case  of Yasapala,  the  President's  belief  in  the  necessity  or"
"","expediency of an emergency regulation is deemed conclusive of its validity, as he is"
"","not  bound  as  a  matter  of  law  to  disclose  the  reasons  for  the  proclamation.  This"
"","principle  aligns  with  the  reasoning  in  Carltona  Ltd.  v  Commissioners  of Works5"
"","(cited by Sharvananda J. in Yasapala v Wickramasinghe6), where it was held:"
"","“All that the Court can do is to see that the power which it is claimed to exercise is"
"","one which falls within the four corners of the power given by the legislature and to"
"","see that those powers are exercised in good faith. Apart from that, the Courts have"
"","no power at all to inquire into the reasonableness, the policy, the sense, or any other"
"","aspect of the transaction.”"
"[25]","This validation was reiterated in R v. Comptroller General of Patents, ex. P. Bayer"
"","Products Ltd7, where it was held that if a regulation is good on its face, the necessity,"
"","or the expediency of making such regulation could not be canvassed in the courts."
"","However, it is pertinent to note that the finality clause under Section 8 of the Public"
"","Security Ordinance  does not exempt emergency regulations from judicial review."
"","This was stated in Siriwardena and others v. Liyanage and others8,"
"[26]","In Edirisuriya v. Navaratnam and Others9 the Court was of the view that when the"
"","exercise of such power is challenged, it is open to the Court to examine whether the"
"","impugned power has been exercised as required by law in the circumstances under"
