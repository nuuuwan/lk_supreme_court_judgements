"conjecture or vague surmise. His information must give rise to a reasonable suspicion"
"that the suspect was concerned in the commission of an offence for which he could"

"and  vague  nature  but  of  a  positive  and  definite  character  providing  reasonable"
"ground for suspecting that the person arrested was concerned in the commission of"
"an offence.”4"
