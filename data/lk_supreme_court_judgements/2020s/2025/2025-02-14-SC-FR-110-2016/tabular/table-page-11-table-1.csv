"An arrest based purely on the subjective satisfaction of the police officer would be"
"arbitrary and viola­tive of Article 13(1).”"
"27. Amerasinghe J described the applicable test, in the judgment of Senaratne v. Punya de"
"Silva and Others,7 as follows:"
"“Were there circumstances, objectively regarded—the subjective satisfaction of the"
"officer  making 
the  arrest 
is  not  enough—that  should  have 
induced 
the  First"
"respondent to suspect that the petitioner was concerned in the commission of those"
"offences?”"
"28. Citing  the  above  authority  of  Senaratne  v.  Punya, Wengappuli  J  stated  in  Shreemath"
"Muthukumara Algawatte v. Chamika Kulasiri, Inspector of Police and Others,8 that,"
"“the  legality  of  the  arrest  […]  would  have  to  be  determined  [by]  this  Court  by"
"objectively  assessing  whether  the  material  available  at  the  time  of  arrest  was"
"sufficient to induce the officer to act on that complaint, by treating [the] same as a"
"‘reasonable complaint’.”"
"29. Therefore,  the  question  before  this  Court  is  whether  there  was  material  to  conceive  a"
"reasonable suspicion of an objective character for an officer to cause such arrest, which"
"includes  the  degree  of  reasonableness  present 
in  the  complaint  made  against  the"
"Petitioner. To answer this question, it is necessary to peruse the material available to the"
"police officers prior to the arrest."
"30. The  B-Report  submitted  by 
the  2nd  Respondent,  marked  ""1R9”,  contains  detailed"
"statements and evidentiary material pertaining to the alleged transactions and activities"
"7 (1995) 1 Sri L.R. 272, at p. 284"
"8 S.C. F/R 325/2013, S.C. minutes of 22nd February 2024), at p. 11"
