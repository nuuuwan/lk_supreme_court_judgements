RESPONDENTS

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 3 of 17

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The Petitioner, Mr. Gamlath Bandara Rathnasiri (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner),

alleges a violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of Sri

Lanka by one or more of the Respondents. By a petition dated 28th March 2016, the

Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, alleging breaches of Articles 12(1), 13(1),

and 13(2) of the Constitution. On 26th October 2010, this Court granted leave to proceed

against the 1st to 4th and 6th Respondents for the purported violations of the Petitioners

constitutionally enshrined rights in Articles 12(1), 13(1), and 13(2) of the Constitution.

2. The Petitioner was recruited by Lanka Fisheries Corporation in September 2001 as a

Trainee Executive. Over the years, he rose through the ranks, ultimately serving as Zonal

Manager of Zone IV and Manager of the Beruwela Regional Office at the time of filing the

petition.

3. The Respondents comprise the following: the 1st to 5th Respondents are members of the

Sri Lanka Police, while the 6th Respondent served as the Purchasing Officer of the Beruwela

Regional Office of the Lanka Fisheries Corporation.

Facts according to the Petitioner

4. It is necessary first to outline the factual backdrop of this case. The 6th Respondent lodged

a complaint with the Beruwela Police on 23rd December 2015, alleging financial

misconduct by the Petitioner in connection with the Lanka Fisheries Corporation. Pursuant

to this complaint, the Petitioner was directed to appear at the Beruwela Police Station on

18th February 2016 at 9:00 a.m. for the recording of his statement. The Petitioner states

that, despite arriving at or around 9:00-9:30 a.m., the Petitioners statement was recorded

only at 2:30 p.m. that same day. Shortly thereafter, the 2nd Respondent arrested the

Petitioner under the direction of the 3rd Respondent.

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 17

5. On 19th February 2016 (the next day) at around 3:00-3:30 pm, the Petitioner was produced

before the learned Magistrate of Kalutara with a certificate of the 4th Respondent under

the Offences Against Public Property Act (No. 12 of 1982) (hereinafter Offences Against

Public Property Act) with the effect that the Petitioner had cheated public money

amounting to over Rupees 100,000. Accordingly, the learned Magistrate remanded the

Petitioner. The Petitioners application for bail was refused by the learned Magistrate.

6. Aggrieved by the learned Magistrates bail refusal, the Petitioners wife filed a revision

application before the Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden of Kalutara.

On 25th February 2016, the learned High Court judge, whilst staying the proceedings of

the case before the Magistrate Court, directed that the Petitioner be enlarged on bail. The

Petitioner contends that despite the bail bond being communicated and accepted when

the matter was called before the Magistrate Court on 29th February 2016, a certified copy

of the bail order could not be obtained by reason of the learned Magistrates retirement

for the day, resulting in the Petitioner remaining in remand custody until he was released

on 1st March 2016.

7. The Petitioners grievances towards the 1st to 4th Respondents in relation to the violation

of his rights guaranteed under Article 13(2) pertain to his purported restriction of liberty

and unlawful detention by the officers contrary to procedure established by law due to:

firstly, alleged failure to produce the Petitioner before a competent court within 24 hours

provided that he was required to be present at the Station at 9-9:30 am on 18th February

and produced before the Magistrate the next day at 3-3:30 pm and, secondly, alleged

reporting of false and/or fabricated facts to the learned Magistrate by maliciously

attempting to take away the learned Magistrates jurisdiction to enlarge the Petitioner on

bail.

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 17

8. In relation to the Petitioners complaint in relation to the violation of his rights guaranteed

under Article 13(1), it is the Petitioners contention that the 6th Respondent is guilty of

impropriety or connivance with the 1st-4th Respondents, which led to his arbitrary and

illegal arrest which is without reasonable cause and, therefore, a violation of his

constitutional rights protecting him from the same.

9. The Petitioner frames his relationship with the 6th Respondent as contentious and

recounts a series of events that purport to establish a history of animosity between them.

Such series of events are narrated in the petition as follows: according to the Petitioner,

when the Petitioner was appointed as Regional Manager, he was aware that the 6th

Respondent was transferred to the Galle Regional Office purportedly due to acts of

financial irregularities. However, the Petitioner states that instead of assuming his duties

in the Galle, the 6th Respondent continued to remain in the Beruwala Regional Office. The

Petitioner having informed the higher management of this discrepancy, the services of

the 6th Respondent were formally vacated, which the Petitioner paints as the first stroke

of animosity that developed between him and the 6th Respondent.

10. The situation escalated when the Petitioner lodged a complaint on or around 5th

December 2015 at the Beruwala Police Station against the 6th Respondent due to a

purported attempt by the 6th Respondent to plant a parcel of cannabis in the Petitioners

office, allegedly with the intention of entrapping him. The Petitioner states that, to date,

the 2nd Respondent has failed to inquire into or take any action to resolve the Petitioners

complaint, which the Petitioner asserts is a violation of his fundamental right to equality

enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

11. Further, based on the history of antagonism between the Petitioner and the 6th

Respondent, the Petitioner alleges that the 6th Respondent is guilty of connivance with

the 1st-4th Respondents to illegally arrest the Petitioner, stating that the complaint is a

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 17

false and malicious one provided that the 6th Respondent is not an aggrieved or

concerned party.

Facts according to the Respondents

12. The affidavit of the 1st Respondent offers a counter-narrative; The 1st Respondent affirms

that the Petitioner filed a complaint against the 6th Respondent at the Beruwela Police

Station, which was investigated by the Wadduwa Police Station by virtue of the fact that

the Petitioner was a resident of Wadduwa. The 1st Respondent further contends that an

inquiry was, in fact, conducted, at the conclusion of which the 6th Respondent was issued

a warning.

13. The 1st Respondent also affirms that the 6th Respondent lodged a complaint on 23rd

December 2015 against the Petitioner in the backdrop of alleged acts of financial fraud at

the Lanka Fisheries Corporation. Prior to such complaint, the then Honourable Minister of

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development, Mr. Dilip Wedaarachchi, advised the Senior

Superintendent of the Kalutara Police Division, the 3rd Respondent, to investigate the

financial irregularities at the Lanka Fisheries Corporation by letter dated 28th October

2015.1 According to the 1st Respondent, his investigations into the acts of financial fraud

were therefore also supported by instructions from the 3rd Respondent, SSP of the

Kalutara area.

14. The Petitioner was subsequently arrested on 18th February 2016 based on, according to

the 1st Respondent, sufficient evidence available against him for committing financial

fraud amounting to Rupees 162,350 at the Lanka Fisheries Corporation. The 1st

Respondent, in his affidavit, also denies the Petitioners averments in relation to his bail

1 Marked 1R4

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 17

application and further contends that all duties were carried out in good faith and

according to the procedure established by law.

Analysis

Alleged violation of Article 13(1)

15. I will first deal with the Petitioners complaint of the violation of his rights under Article

13(1) of the Constitution, which safeguards, inter alia, an individuals right to freedom

from arbitrary arrest. Article 13(1) states that No person shall be arrested except according

to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his

arrest."

16. The 6th Respondents complaint to the Beruwala Police Station implicating the Petitioner

in acts of financial fraud is accused of being false and malicious, especially given that he

is not an aggrieved party to the crimes alleged. In fact, there is no indication in the present

body of law preventing any person from reporting a crime.

17. One needs only to peruse the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to understand this;

Section 109 of the Act, codified under Chapter XI: Information to Police Officers and

Inquirers and their Powers to Investigate reads as follows: (1) Every information

relating to the commission of an offence may be given orally or in writing to a police officer

or inquirer.

18. While the term complainant is not defined in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,

complaint is described in section 2 in the below manner:

Complaint means the allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a

view to his taking action under this Code that some person, whether known or

unknown, has committed an offence

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 17

19. Furthermore, section 136(1) of Chapter XIV, which deals with the commencement of

proceedings before the Magistrates Court, refers to the fact proceedings in a Magistrates

Court shall be instituted on a complaint being made orally or in writing to a Magistrate of

such Court that an offence has been committed, which such Court has the jurisdiction

either to inquire into or try such a complaint.

20. In Kesara Senanayake v. Attorney General and Another,2 Shiranee Bandaranayake J (as

Her Ladyship was then), analysed a line of authorities that deal with the interpretation of

complainant, in the manner quoted below:

Referring to the provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which deals with

the complaints, Dias, J. in The Attorney-General v. Herath Singho had stated that the

complainant must mean the person, who makes the complaint. In Herath Singho

(supra) Dias, J., had to consider the applicability of the word complaint defined in

Section 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in relation to other relevant sections

in the Code. Considering the question, Dias, J., was of the view that the aggrieved

person or persons or the police, who have been induced by the aggrieved person or

persons, could take up the grievance before Court. In such instances, if the aggrieved

person or persons desire to be the complainant, the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

would give him the right to make a complaint making himself the complainant. If,

on the other hand, the aggrieved person or persons, without exercising their right to

make a complaint in terms of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, state their

grievances to the police, who after inquiry decides to take up the case and institute

proceedings on their own, the said police would file their complaint and the

aggrieved person or persons would cease to be complainants. In such situations, it

2 [2010] 1 Sri. L.R. 149, at p.154-155

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 17

is clear that the police officers, who instituted the proceedings would become the

complainant.

Dias, J., in The Attorney-General v. Herath Singho (supra) referring to Dalton, J.s

decision in Nonis v. Appuhamy had stated that,

" . . . for the institution of proceedings by complaint or written report, the

person making the complaint or written report is regarded as the party

instituting the proceedings against the accused person.

This position was further affirmed by Dalton, J., in Babi Nona v. Wijesinghe, where

the Court had considered the right of appeal of an aggrieved party in a matter in

which the proceedings were instituted on a written report by a police officer.

21. The Petitioners misconception that the 6th Respondent is barred from lodging a

complaint to report a crime is, therefore, misguided and erroneous.

22. The Petitioner has also alleged that he was arrested by the 1st Respondent in the absence

of reasonable cause. Section 32 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act prescribes the

specific circumstances and manner in which a peace officer may lawfully effect an arrest

without a warrant. In the present case, the Petitioner was admittedly arrested without a

warrant, necessitating strict compliance of his arrest with the statutory provisions in that

Section.

23. The applicable part of the statutory provisions in Section 32(1)(b) in relation to arrests,

states that any peace officer may, without an order from a Magistrate and without a

warrant, arrest any person;

who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or against whom a reasonable

complaint has been made or credible information has been received or a reasonable

suspicion exists of his having been concerned

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 17

24. It is paramount first to understand what constitutes reasonable cause or reasonable

suspicion. In the oft-cited case of Channa Pieris and Others v. Attorney General and

Others,3 the Court held, thus:

However the officer making an arrest cannot act on a suspicion founded on mere

conjecture or vague surmise. His information must give rise to a reasonable suspicion

that the suspect was concerned in the commission of an offence for which he could

have arrested a person without a warrant. The suspicion must not be of an uncertain

and vague nature but of a positive and definite character providing reasonable

ground for suspecting that the person arrested was concerned in the commission of

an offence.4

25. Per Gratiaen J in Muttusamy v. Kannangara,5 the well-known test of reasonableness of

a suspicion is that,

a suspicion is proved to be reasonable if the facts disclose that it was founded on

matters within the police officers own knowledge or on statements made by other

persons in a way which justify him in giving them credit....

26. Gamlath v. Neville Silva and others,6 Kulatunga J, with reference to the above

observation in Muttusamy v. Kannangara (supra), opined the following:

The observance of this procedure is now a constitutional right under Article 13(1)

of the Constitution which guarantees freedom from arbitrary arrest. The information

on which the arrest is based must be credible by the application of the objective test.

3 [1994] 1 Sri. L.R. 1, at p. 47

4 Emphasis omitted

5 52 N.L.R. 324, at p.327

6 [1991] 2 Sri. L.R. 267, at p. 275

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 17

An arrest based purely on the subjective satisfaction of the police officer would be

arbitrary and violative of Article 13(1).

27. Amerasinghe J described the applicable test, in the judgment of Senaratne v. Punya de

Silva and Others,7 as follows:

Were there circumstances, objectively regardedthe subjective satisfaction of the

officer making the arrest is not enoughthat should have induced the First

respondent to suspect that the petitioner was concerned in the commission of those

offences?

28. Citing the above authority of Senaratne v. Punya, Wengappuli J stated in Shreemath

Muthukumara Algawatte v. Chamika Kulasiri, Inspector of Police and Others,8 that,

the legality of the arrest [] would have to be determined [by] this Court by

objectively assessing whether the material available at the time of arrest was

sufficient to induce the officer to act on that complaint, by treating [the] same as a

reasonable complaint.

29. Therefore, the question before this Court is whether there was material to conceive a

reasonable suspicion of an objective character for an officer to cause such arrest, which

includes the degree of reasonableness present in the complaint made against the

Petitioner. To answer this question, it is necessary to peruse the material available to the

police officers prior to the arrest.

30. The B-Report submitted by the 2nd Respondent, marked "1R9, contains detailed

statements and evidentiary material pertaining to the alleged transactions and activities

7 (1995) 1 Sri L.R. 272, at p. 284

8 S.C. F/R 325/2013, S.C. minutes of 22nd February 2024), at p. 11

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 17

involving the Petitioner in his capacity as an employee of the Corporations Beruwela

Regional Office. I have outlined this material from the relevant excerpts in the subsequent

paragraphs of this judgment.

31. According to the B-Report, one Mohamed Hussain Mohamed Suraj attested that he

supplied fish pursuant to orders placed by the Petitioner, Rathnasiri Bandara. In his

statement, he further provided that, his business enterprise was not formally registered,

he did not maintain financial records or accounts, and he transacted based on the

[price of the day]. Conveniently, he was unable to recall or specify

the prices at which the fish were sold.

32. Mohamed Suraj also stated that several bills bore forged signatures purporting to identify

him as the supplier. He stated that these documents were subsequently presented to him

for his signature, which he affixed after the falsification had occurred. Furthermore,

Mohamed Suraj alleged that multiple cheques were issued in his name, none of which he

received. He expressed his lack of knowledge as to the identities of those who ultimately

encashed the cheques.

33. Dhammika Sanjeewa, a Purchasing Officer, provided a statement indicating that he

procured fish for the Beruwela Executive under directives issued to him. He clarified the

following: Prior to 20th October 2015, the Beruwela Executive Purchasing Officer was

Aruna Shantha (the 6th Respondent). During this period, Mohamed Suraj was not

recognised as a supplier to the Beruwela Executive. He further stated that, acting under

the explicit instructions of Rathnasiri Bandara, the Petitioner, he signed bills submitted in

the name of Mohamed Suraj in his capacity as Purchasing Officer.

34. Roshini Maduwage, who held the position of Chief Clerk at the Beruwela Regional Office

until 17th November 2015 and was entrusted with overseeing accounts-related

responsibilities, affirmed that payments to all other suppliers of fish to the Beruwela

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 17

Regional Office were duly processed, with the sole exception of Mohamed Suraj. Cheques

ostensibly intended for payments to Mohamed Suraj were routed through the Manager,

Rathnasiri Bandara, and further that she had no knowledge of whether such payments

were actually effected. Roshini Maduwage also corroborated that Mohamed Suraj never

appeared in person at the Beruwela Branch to collect his cheques or payments.

35. Finally, the B-Report details the statement of Dinusha Perera, who succeeded Roshini

Maduwage as Chief Clerk after 15th November 2015, and independently corroborated the

aforementioned assertions regarding the non-receipt of payments or cheques by

Mohamed Suraj.

36. Evidently, the cumulative weight of the statements and corroborative testimonies in this

case provides sufficient grounds for the peace officers to form a reasonable suspicion of

an objective character. These irregularities, coupled with the direct assertions of

individuals involved and their corroborative nature, establish not only a reasonable, but

well-founded, basis for suspicion that transcends mere conjecture. Such suspicion aligns

with the legal threshold required for the arrest of the suspect of such alleged crime.

37. Based on the above, it is the opinion of this Court that the 1st Respondent was justified in

possessing reasonable suspicion towards the commission of the crime by the Petitioner,

and thus, the arrest of the Petitioner was legal and in accordance with the rights

guaranteed by Article 13(1) of the Constitution.

Alleged violation of Article 13(2)

38. Article 13(2) of the Constitution enshrines the following:

Every person held in custody, detained or otherwise deprived of personal liberty shall

be brought before the judge of the nearest competent court according to procedure

established by law and shall not be further held in custody, detained or deprived of

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 17

personal liberty except upon and in terms of the order of such judge made in

accordance with procedure established by law.

39. This is supplemented by Section 37 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which states

that,

Any peace officer shall not detain in custody or otherwise confine a person arrested

without a warrant for a longer period than under all the circumstances of the case is

reasonable, and such period shall not exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the time

necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate.

40. Section 37 imposes a mandatory duty on peace officers not to detain suspects in custody

or confine them for a period not exceeding twenty-four hours, leaving out only a narrow

margin of time, in view of the practicalities involved with the actual production of suspects

before a judicial officer. The Petitioner was arrested on 18th February 2016 at around 2.00

pm, as evidenced by the Petitioners recorded statement submitted by the 1st Respondent

to this Court (marked 1R8) and was presented before the learned Magistrate of Kalutara

the next day, 19th February 2016, at around 3:00 pm.

41. I therefore do not find cause or reason to entertain the Petitioners contention that he

was unlawfully detained at any point during the process of his arrest and production

before the Magistrate Court of Kalutara for a period longer than under all the

circumstances of the case is reasonable.

42. Further, in my view the Petitioner has failed to present any cogent material before this

Court to support his allegation that the Respondents reported false or fabricated facts to

the learned Magistrate which purportedly affected the jurisdiction of the Court to enlarge

the Petitioner on bail.

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 17

43. In the learned Magistrates order,9 he refuses to authorise the Petitioners bail application

on the basis that the Petitioner is charged with an offence under section 8(1) of the

Offences Against Public Property Act, which provides:

8. (1) The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, in

relation to bail shall apply where any person surrenders himself or is produced on

arrest on an allegation that he has committed or has been concerned in committing

or is suspected to have committed or to have been concerned in committing an

offence under this Act:

Provided, however, that where a Gazetted officer not below the rank of Assistant

Superintendent of Police certifies that the value of the subject-matter in respect of

which the offence was committed, exceeds five thousand rupees such person shall be

kept on remand until the conclusion of the trial. It shall be competent for the court.

in exceptional circumstances to release such person on ball after recording reasons

therefor.

44. Below is the relevant excerpt from P15A, wherein the learned Magistrate reasons that,

[sic] . [this Court is unable lead evidence at this stage

to make a decision on that]10

45. The immediate succeeding provision in the Act allows for the convicted individual to

lodge a petition of appeal and, if such appeal is proved successful, empowers a competent

court to release such individual on bail:

9 Marked P15A

10 An approximate translation added

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 17

8. (2) Every person convicted by the court of any offence under this Act shall,

notwithstanding that he has lodged a petition of appeal against his conviction or the

sentence imposed on him, be kept on remand until the determination of the appeal:

Provided, however, that it shall be competent for such court in exceptional

circumstances to release such person on bail after recording reasons therefor.

46. Accordingly, following the revision application filed by the Petitioners wife in the High

Court of Kalutara, the learned High Court judge directed that the Petitioner be enlarged

on bail by order dated 25th February 2016.11 Until such determination, the Petitioner was

retained in remand in accordance with the provisions of the afore-cited Act.

47. In these above circumstances, I fail to see any merit in the Petitioners contention that his

liberty was in any way restricted in a manner that offends his rights protected by Article

13(2).

Alleged violation of Article 12(1)

48. Finally, the Petitioner alleges that he was denied his right to equal protection of the law,

when he was arrested and detained due to a personal animosity harboured against him

by the 6th Respondent, which occasioned a violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed

under Article 12(1).

49. Despite the Petitioners allegations that the 2nd Respondent failed to inquire into the

complaints lodged by him against the 6th Respondent, the relevant Information Book

extracts submitted by the 1st Respondent, marked 1R1 and 1R2, denounce such

allegations by revealing that the Petitioners complaint was investigated by the Wadduwa

Police Station, the Petitioner had failed to appear on the date he was summoned by the

11 Marked P17B

SC/FR 110/2016 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 17

Station to conduct the inquiry, and the conclusion of the complaint culminated in the 6th

Respondent receiving a warning.

50. In light of the above circumstances, it is my view that the Petitioner has failed to establish

any discriminatory treatment by the Respondents in a manner which offends his right to

equality under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

51. In light of the numerous considerations discussed in the preceding paragraphs, I am of

the firm view that the alleged illegality of the Petitioner's arrest and detention cannot be

sustained as a valid grievance against any of the Respondents. The Petitioner has failed

to demonstrate that the actions of the Respondents, undertaken in their executive

capacities, amounted to violations of his fundamental rights as guaranteed under Articles

12(1), 13(1), and 13(2) of the Constitution. Accordingly, this application is dismissed, and

no order is made as to costs.

Application Dismissed.
