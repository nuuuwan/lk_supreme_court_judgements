"However,  Courts  have  also  held  that  the  word  “guarantee”  is  open  to  a  number  of"
"meanings and its meaning when used in a specific document depends on the context in"
"which it is used. In Walker’s Fruit Farms Ltd v. Sumner [1930 TPD 394 at 398], Greenberg,"
"J. held that the ordinary meaning is to assure a person of the receipt or possession of"
"something. In Dempster v. Addington Football Club (Pty) Ltd. [1967(3) SA 262(D) at 267]"
"and Cazalet v. Johnson [1914 TPD 142 at 145] it was held to mean ‘pay’."
"An example of the interpretation of the word “guarantee” in the context of the contract"
"as a whole is found in Hutchinson v. Hylton Holdings and Another [supra.].  The defendant"
"had signed a document in which he guaranteed specific performance of the contract for"
"the sale of land in his personal capacity. The purchaser of the land was non-existent so"
"there  was  no  principal  obligation  and  no  suretyship.  The  Court  held  that  the  clause"
"resulted in an independent undertaking. The defendant had contracted as a co-principal"
"debtor  and  not  surety.  His  undertaking  was  held  not  to  be  dependent  upon  the  non-"
"performance of the purchaser but was in the form of an indemnity. Here the use of the"
"word  guarantee  was  construed  to  create  an  independent  obligation  and  hence  the"
"undertaking was not a suretyship. Such result is not possible if one were to assume that"
"“suretyship” and “guarantee” are interchangeable."
"Similarly, in List v. Jungers [1979(3) SA 106 (A) at 117-119] the use of the word guarantee"
"was held by Court to mean an original undertaking whereby the promisor bound himself"
"as principal debtor and not as surety."
