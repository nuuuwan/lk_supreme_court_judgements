"As explained by Aluwihare, P.C., J. in Chandra Gunasekara v. People’s Bank and Others"
"[S.C. Appeal (CHC) 43/2012, S.C.M. 11.10.2019 at page 21]:"
"“The only question that arose in that case [Agostinu (supra)] was whether entries"
"in the books of a banker have been proved in the manner prescribed in Section 90C"
"of the Evidence Ordinance."
"In a brief judgment, Basnayake C.J. held that, ""Section 90C does not apply to the"
"'statements  produced'.  The  only  way  of  proving  entries  in  a  banker's  book  is  by"
"either producing the original or certified copies of the entries therein as prescribed"
"by Section 90C"" (emphasis added)."
"What was produced in Court in the case of Agostinu was a bare statement, without"
"any  certification,  and  based  on  some  entries  which  had  been  certified  by  the"
"accountant of the bank. It appears, then, that although the original entries of the"
"bank had been certified by the accountant, the transcription of those entries that"
"was produced in Court carried no certification. Basnayake C.J. correctly held that"
"the statement was inadmissible in as much as it is a mandatory requirement under"
