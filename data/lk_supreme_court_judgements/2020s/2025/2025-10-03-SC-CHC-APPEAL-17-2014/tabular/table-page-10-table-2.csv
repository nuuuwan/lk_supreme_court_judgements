"on the happening of certain events."
"According to Caney [supra., page 32]:"
"“What then is the difference between a guarantee that a debtor will perform and"
"suretyship? Lubbe makes one point of distinction clear : the guarantor’s obligation,"
"as an obligation independent of that of the debtor, is to indemnify the creditor in"
"respect  of  losses  suffered  through  the  debtor’s  non-performance,  whereas  the"
"surety, as we have seen, is only liable for losses resulting from the debtor’s breach"
"of contract [...] suretyship is an undertaking, in the first instance, that the debtor"
"himself  will  perform,  and  only  secondarily  that  if  he  fails  to  perform  that  the"
"surety will do so. With guarantee, on the other hand, the guarantor undertakes"
"to pay on the happening of a certain event but does not promise that that event"
"will not happen.” (emphasis added)"
