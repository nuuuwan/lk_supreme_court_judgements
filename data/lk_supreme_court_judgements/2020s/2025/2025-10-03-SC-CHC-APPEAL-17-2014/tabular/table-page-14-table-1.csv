"Relying on the decision in Agostinu v. Kumaraswamy (59 NLR 132), it was submitted that"
"the only way of proving entries in a banker’s book is by either producing the original or"
"certified  copies  of  the  entries  therein  as  prescribed  by  Section  90C  of  the  Evdence"
"Ordinance."
"Our attention was also drawn to Sections 5 and 6 of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act"
"No. 14 of 1995."
"The rationale for the decision in Agostinu (supra) is that the document that was produced"
"in that case is not a certified copy of the entries in the banker's book, but a statement"
"prepared with the aid of those entries certified by the accountant of the bank."
"As explained by Aluwihare, P.C., J. in Chandra Gunasekara v. People’s Bank and Others"
