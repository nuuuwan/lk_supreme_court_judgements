Janak De Silva, J.

This is an appeal arising from a judgment delivered by the Commercial High Court of the

Western Province holden in Colombo (Commercial High Court) on 02.09.2013. The

Commercial High Court held that the 2nd Defendant-Appellant (2nd Defendant) is liable to

pay a sum of Rs. 3,047,449.94 to the Plaintiff-Respondent (Plaintiff) together with interest

thereon at the rate of 24% per annum from 09.09.2007 until repayment in full.

Factual Matrix

On 02.09.2005, the Plaintiff, by lease agreement dated 02.09.2005 (Lease Agreement),

leased a brand-new Chrysler Grand Voyager vehicle to Snap-R Coatings and Chemicals

International (Pvt) Ltd. (Lessee). The period of lease was from 12.10.2005 to 12.10.2010.

The Lease Agreement stipulated 60 monthly rentals of Rs. 150,203 each and a 24% per

annum interest on delayed payments.

Page 4 of 18

In terms of Clause 7 of the Lease Agreement, the Lessee agreed that any default being

made by it in the payment of money due thereon or otherwise acting in breach of the

terms and conditions thereof, it shall be lawful for the Plaintiff to terminate the Lease

Agreement and to recover the money which are due thereon.

The offer letter (P1) required a guarantee from the 2nd Defendant and the 1st Defendant-

Respondent (1st Defendant) as security. They were, at that time, shareholders and

directors of the Lessee.

Accordingly, a Guarantee of Lease Agreement (Guarantee) dated 02.09.2005, was

executed by the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

Following a payment default commencing around August 2006, the 1st Defendant

surrendered the vehicle on 17.10.2006, requesting its sale to reduce the debt. The Plaintiff

formally terminated the Lease Agreement on 02.11.2006. After accounting for all credits,

a sum of Rs. 3,047,449.94 remained together with interest thereon at the rate of 24% per

annum from 09.09.2007 until the payment in full. A demand was made on the Lessee for

this outstanding amount.

As the Lessee failed to settle the outstanding amount, and relying expressly on the

Guarantee (P3), the Plaintiff instituted the present action on 11.07.2011 in the

Commercial High Court against the 1st and 2nd Defendants as guarantors. The summons

could not be served on the 1st Defendant, and the trial proceeded between the Plaintiff

and the 2nd Defendant.

The learned counsel for the Appellant sought to impugn the judgment of the Commercial

High Court on the following grounds:

(1) The Plaintiff has failed to make a valid demand from the 2nd Defendant.

(2) This cause of action should have first been referred to compulsory arbitration in

terms of the Lease Agreement.

Page 5 of 18

(3) The statements of account (“P5”, “P5A”, “P5B”) were derivative creations and not

certified copies of bankers' books as required by Section 90A of the Evidence

Ordinance No. 14 of 1895 and therefore inadmissible.

Demand

The learned counsel for the 2nd Defendant submitted that a cause of action on the

Guarantee will arise only upon a demand made by the Plaintiff from the 2nd Defendant. In

support of this proposition, he cited the decisions in Bradford Old Bank v. Sutcliffe [(1918)

2 KB 833], L.B. Finance v. Manchanayake [(2000) 2 Sri LR 142], Seylan Bank Ltd. v. Inter

Trade Garments (Pvt) Ltd. [(2005) 1 Sri LR 80] and Sivasubramaniam v. Alagamuttu (53

NLR 150)].

The heading of the Guarantee states “Guarantee of Lease Agreement”. Nevertheless, one

cannot interpret a contract based purely on internal linguistic considerations. The mere

use of a descriptive term cannot affect the reality of the transaction. The agreement must

be objectively construed as a whole to determine the intention of the parties.

Clause 1 of the Guarantee reads as follows:

“[…] (hereinafter called "the Lessee" which expression shall include its successors-in-title and permitted assigns) we, the undersigned, do and each of us both hereby jointly and severally guarantee to you the punctual payment by the Lessee of all rental, interest, the Stipulated Loss value referred to in schedule of the Lease Agreement and all other sums whatsoever due under the Lease Agreement and the performance of all the Lessee's obligations thereunder and we and each of us further jointly and severally undertake to indemnify you on demand against all losses, expenses (including legal costs on a full indemnity basis) charges and damages incurred or suffered by you in consequence of any failure by the Lessee to perform any of one of the Lessee's obligations whether express or implied under the Lease Agreement and including the payment of any damages and/or cost awarded to the Lessor by a competent Court of Law in respect of the Lease Agreement.” (emphasis added)

Clearly, the obligation of the 2nd Defendant was conditional upon a duly made demand.

Page 6 of 18

The 1st witness for the Plaintiff was T.P.M. Dharmabandhu, Executive Officer. Along with

his affidavit, documents marked P1 to P6(d) was tendered in evidence. P6(b) was the

demand made on the 2nd Defendant. At the commencement of his examination-in-chief,

Counsel for the 2nd Defendant moved that document marked P5 should be marked subject

to proof. P5 was the Statement of Account. None of the other documents including P6(b)

were marked subject to proof.

Where no objection is taken when the document is sought to be tendered in evidence,

and the document is not forbidden by law to be received in evidence, any objection to its

receipt as evidence is deemed to have been waived. [See Kenakal v. Velapillai (2 NLR 80);

Muttaiya Chetty v. Harmanis Appu (4 NLR 184); Silva v. Kindersley (18 NLR 85); Siyadoris

v. Danoris (42 NLR 311); Multiform Chemicals Limited v. Adrian Machado (S.C. Appeal

183/2011, S.C.M. 18.07.2024)].

Nevertheless, I observe that when the documents marked P1 to P6(d) was read in

evidence at the close of the case for the Plaintiff, the Counsel for the 2nd Defendant

objected on the basis that P5, P5(a), P5(b), P5(c) were not proved. Even assuming that this

was a reference to documents marked P6(a), P6(b) and P6(c), it was an exercise in futility

and an attempt to close the stable door after the horse has bolted. The Plaintiff has proved

that a demand was made on the 2nd Defendant as required by the Guarantee.

Compulsory Arbitration

The next point urged by the learned counsel for the 2nd Defendant is that the Plaintiff

should have first referred this matter to arbitration. Reliance was placed on Clause 18 of

the lease agreement which reads as follows:

"JURISDICTION

In the event of any default or non-observance by Lessee of the terms and

conditions contained in this Lease Agreement or in any other case and in the event

Page 7 of 18

of any dispute, difference or question which may from time to time and at any time

hereafter arise or occur between the Lessor and Lessee or their respective

representatives or permitted assigns touching or concerning or arising out of, under,

in relation to or in respect of this Lease Agreement or any provision matter or thing

contained herein or the subject matter hereof, or the operation, interpretation or

construction hereof or of any clause hereof or as to the rights, duties or liabilities of

either party hereunder or in connection with the premises or their respective

representatives or permitted assigns including all questions that may arise after

the termination or cancellation of this lease, such dispute difference or question

may, notwithstanding the remedies available under this Lease Agreement or in law

by the Lessor only, be submitted in writing at its sole option for arbitration by a

single arbitrator to be nominated by the parties or if such nomination is not

practicable, by two arbitrators one to be appointed by Lessor and the other by

Lessee and an umpire to be nominated by the two arbitrators." (emphasis added)

It was submitted that the 1st and 2nd Defendants become principal debtors consequent to

a demand being made on them which then means that the 2nd Defendant is akin to the

Lessee in the Lease Agreement.

I have no hesitation in rejecting this proposition. On an objective reading of the arbitration

clause as well as the Lease Agreement as a whole, the scope of the arbitration clause

covers only disputes between the Lessor and Lessee.

Let me further expound my reasoning by identifying the nature of a guarantee.

None of the parties to this action is a bank. The Lease Agreement is not part of a banking

transaction. Hence, the transaction between the parties in this action does not fall within

Banks and Banking in Section 3 of the Civil Law Ordinance. The governing law of the Lease

Agreement is Roman-Dutch law.

Page 8 of 18

There was a general rule in early Roman law that a contract should not benefit or bind a

third party. This was known as alteri stipulari non potest. A stranger to a contract was

outside the scope of the rights and duties arising thereunder. This rigid rule was subject

to progressive modification in later Roman law.

Roman-Dutch law did not adopt the strict approach of Roman law to third party rights.

According to Grotius (3.3.38), Roman-Dutch law allows a third party to accept the promise

and thus acquire a right unless the promisor revokes the promise before such acceptance

by the third party. Similarly, a stipulation in a contract in favour of a third party can be

enforced by such party where it has been accepted by him [Jinadasa v. Silva (34 NLR 344),

De Silva v. Margaret Nona (40 NLR 251), Marthelis Appuhamy v. Peiris (47 NLR 78].

The arbitration clause does not have any stipulation indicating that the 1st and 2nd

Defendants as Guarantors are to benefit from it.

Moreover, according to Roman-Dutch law, the obligation created thereunder is

independent of the obligations created under the Lease Agreement and the 2nd Defendant

cannot rely on the scope of the arbitration clause contained in the Lease Agreement. Let

me explain my conclusion.

According to Weeramantry [The Law of Contracts, Vol. I, page 190], contracts which

charge a person with the debt, default or miscarriage of another are contracts of

suretyship or guarantee. He appears to proceed on the basis that “suretyship” and

“guarantee” are interchangeable.

Indeed, many writings and judicial decisions do reflect this understanding [See Caney’s

The Law of Suretyship, 1st and 2nd editions; Walter Pereira, The Laws of Ceylon, Vol. II, page

629; Geraldine Andrews and Richard Millet, Law of Guarantees [6th ed. (Thomson Reuters,

2011), page 271]; Institutes of Holland, Van Der Linden, Translation by Henry Juta, (3rd ed.,

1897), Chapter XIV, Section X; Institutes of Holland, Van Der Linden, Translation by J.

Page 9 of 18

Henry, (1828), Chapter XIV, Section X. See also, Mouton v. Die Mynwerkersunie (1977(1)

SA 119(A) at 136B); Hazis v. Transvaal and Delagoa Bay Investment Co Ltd. (1939 AD 372

at 384); Hermes Ship Chandlers (Pty) Ltd v. Caltex Oil (SA) Ltd. (1973 (3) SA 263 (D) at

266-7); IIG Capital LLC v. Van Der Merwe and Another (2008) EWCA Civ 542, para. 19; Sri

Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. v People’s Bank (2017) B.L.R. 206].

However, Courts have also held that the word “guarantee” is open to a number of

meanings and its meaning when used in a specific document depends on the context in

which it is used. In Walker’s Fruit Farms Ltd v. Sumner [1930 TPD 394 at 398], Greenberg,

J. held that the ordinary meaning is to assure a person of the receipt or possession of

something. In Dempster v. Addington Football Club (Pty) Ltd. [1967(3) SA 262(D) at 267]

and Cazalet v. Johnson [1914 TPD 142 at 145] it was held to mean ‘pay’.

An example of the interpretation of the word “guarantee” in the context of the contract

as a whole is found in Hutchinson v. Hylton Holdings and Another [supra.]. The defendant

had signed a document in which he guaranteed specific performance of the contract for

the sale of land in his personal capacity. The purchaser of the land was non-existent so

there was no principal obligation and no suretyship. The Court held that the clause

resulted in an independent undertaking. The defendant had contracted as a co-principal

debtor and not surety. His undertaking was held not to be dependent upon the non-

performance of the purchaser but was in the form of an indemnity. Here the use of the

word guarantee was construed to create an independent obligation and hence the

undertaking was not a suretyship. Such result is not possible if one were to assume that

“suretyship” and “guarantee” are interchangeable.

Similarly, in List v. Jungers [1979(3) SA 106 (A) at 117-119] the use of the word guarantee

was held by Court to mean an original undertaking whereby the promisor bound himself

as principal debtor and not as surety.

Page 10 of 18

These authorities support the statement in Caney’s The Law of Suretyship [Forsyth &

Pretorius (eds.), 5th edition (Juta & Co. Ltd., 2002), page 27], that “guarantee” is a distinct

although difficult concept and seeks to provide a precise definition and explore its

relationship with suretyship. Caney [supra. page 31] goes on to state that with a contract

of guarantee, the guarantor undertakes a principal obligation to indemnify the promisee

on the happening of certain events.

According to Caney [supra., page 32]:

“What then is the difference between a guarantee that a debtor will perform and

suretyship? Lubbe makes one point of distinction clear : the guarantor’s obligation,

as an obligation independent of that of the debtor, is to indemnify the creditor in

respect of losses suffered through the debtor’s non-performance, whereas the

surety, as we have seen, is only liable for losses resulting from the debtor’s breach

of contract [...] suretyship is an undertaking, in the first instance, that the debtor

himself will perform, and only secondarily that if he fails to perform that the

surety will do so. With guarantee, on the other hand, the guarantor undertakes

to pay on the happening of a certain event but does not promise that that event

will not happen.” (emphasis added)

Thus, in Roman-Dutch law, a “guarantee” given by a guarantor to a promisee in relation to

a promise by a third party to the promisee, does create an independent obligation to that

of the debtor.

I must hasten to add that parties can by agreement determine the exact nature of the

relationship between them notwithstanding the general definition given in the governing

law to particular types of documents. Accordingly, the Guarantee must be examined to

determine the rights and obligations of the parties.

Page 11 of 18

Clause 2 of the Guarantee specifically provide that the 1st and 2nd Defendants have

admitted their liability thereunder to be as principal debtors and not merely as sureties.

Clause 4 reiterates the principal debtor status of the 1st and 2nd Defendants.

Hence even after a demand was made on the 2nd Defendant, it did not result in the 2nd

Defendant stepping into the shoes of the Lessee in the lease agreement. Consequently,

the 2nd Defendant cannot seek the benefit of the arbitration clause to oust jurisdiction of

the Commercial High Court.

In any event, assuming that the cause of action falls within the scope of the arbitration

clause, an objection to jurisdiction cannot be raised now.

In terms of Section 39 of the Judicature Act, whenever any defendant or accused party

shall have pleaded in any action, proceeding or matter brought in any Court of First

Instance neither party shall afterwards be entitled to object to the jurisdiction of such

court, but such court shall be taken and held to have jurisdiction over such action,

proceeding or matter.

Admittedly, the 2nd Defendant did raise a jurisdictional issue before the Commercial High

Court based on the arbitration clause. It was rejected by the learned trial judge by his

order dated 10.07.2012. Court held that although the Lease Agreement contained an

arbitration clause, there is no such clause in the Guarantee. The 2nd Defendant did not

prefer an appeal against the said order and continued to take part in the trial.

Section 5 of the Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995 reads as follows:

“Where a party to an arbitration agreement institutes legal proceedings in a court

against another party to such agreement in respect of a matter agreed to be

submitted for arbitration under such agreement, the court shall have no

jurisdiction to hear and determine such matter if the other party objects to the

court exercising jurisdiction in respect of such matter” (emphasis added)

Page 12 of 18

Clearly the jurisdiction of the Commercial High Court is ousted only where the other party

objects to its jurisdiction. This is a latent or contingent want of jurisdiction and not a

patent or total want of jurisdiction.

In P. Beatrice Perera v. The Commissioner of National Housing (77 NLR 361 at 366), the

distinction between ‘patent’ and ‘latent’ want of jurisdiction is expounded as follows:

“………. Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A court may lack

jurisdiction over the cause or matter or over the parties; it may also lack

competence because of failure to comply with such procedural requirements as are

necessary for the exercise of power by the court. Both are jurisdictional defects; The

first mentioned of these is commonly known in the law as ‘patent’ or ‘total’ want

of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis and the second a ‘latent’ or ‘contingent’

want of jurisdiction or defectus triationis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect

result in judgments or orders which are void. But an important difference must

also be noted. In that class of case where the want of jurisdiction is patent, no

waiver of objection or acquiescence can cure the want of jurisdiction; the reason

for this being that to permit parties by their conduct to confer jurisdiction on a

tribunal which has none would be to admit a power in the parties to litigation to

create new jurisdictions or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits, both of

which are within the exclusive privilege of the legislature; the proceedings in cases

within this category are non coram judice and the want of jurisdiction is incurable.

In other class of case, where the want of jurisdiction is contingent only, the

judgment or order of the Court will be void only against the party on whom it

operates but acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of such person may

estop him from making or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment to

the effect that the Court was lacking in contingent jurisdiction. …….”

Page 13 of 18

Any objection to contingent or latent want of jurisdiction must be raised at the first

available opportunity and if no objection is taken the matter is within the plenary

jurisdiction of the court [See Lily Fernando v. Ronald ( alias R. A. Vanlangenberg) (75 NLR

231), Navaratnasingham v. Arumugam and another (1980) 2 Sri LR 1, Paramasothy v.

Nagalingam (1980) 2 Sri LR 34, Jalaldeen v. Rajaratnam (1986) 2 Sri LR 201, David

Appuhamy v. Yassassi thero (1987) 1 Sri LR 253, Edmund Perera v. Nimalaratne and

another (2005) 3 Sri LR 68].

The 2nd Defendant should have sought leave to appeal against the order rejecting the

objection to jurisdiction. Failure to do so amounts to submission to jurisdiction.

Nevertheless, learned counsel for the 2nd Defendant relies on the decision in Avenra

Gardens (Private) Ltd. v. Global Project Funding [S.C. Appeal 157/2019, S.C.M.

22.02.2022] where I held that it is the clear right of every litigant to invite the Appellate

Court to consider in a final appeal any interlocutory order even if he did not directly

challenge it at the time when it was made.

However, the legal principles and factual circumstances differ. Here, the Commercial High

Court made an order on the jurisdictional objection based on the arbitration clause in the

Lease Agreement. Thereafter, the 2nd Defendant continued to take part in the trial and

submitted to the jurisdiction of the Commercial High Court. He cannot now be entitled to

raise an objection to the jurisdiction of the Commercial High Court.

Admissibility

The final point urged by the learned counsel for the 2nd Defendant is that the Plaintiff has

failed to prove the sums due and owing to it from the 2nd Defendant. He submitted that

this could have been proved only by recourse to Chapter VI of the Evidence Ordinance.

Page 14 of 18

Relying on the decision in Agostinu v. Kumaraswamy (59 NLR 132), it was submitted that

the only way of proving entries in a banker’s book is by either producing the original or

certified copies of the entries therein as prescribed by Section 90C of the Evdence

Ordinance.

Our attention was also drawn to Sections 5 and 6 of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act

No. 14 of 1995.

The rationale for the decision in Agostinu (supra) is that the document that was produced

in that case is not a certified copy of the entries in the banker's book, but a statement

prepared with the aid of those entries certified by the accountant of the bank.

As explained by Aluwihare, P.C., J. in Chandra Gunasekara v. People’s Bank and Others

[S.C. Appeal (CHC) 43/2012, S.C.M. 11.10.2019 at page 21]:

“The only question that arose in that case [Agostinu (supra)] was whether entries

in the books of a banker have been proved in the manner prescribed in Section 90C

of the Evidence Ordinance.

In a brief judgment, Basnayake C.J. held that, "Section 90C does not apply to the

'statements produced'. The only way of proving entries in a banker's book is by

either producing the original or certified copies of the entries therein as prescribed

by Section 90C" (emphasis added).

What was produced in Court in the case of Agostinu was a bare statement, without

any certification, and based on some entries which had been certified by the

accountant of the bank. It appears, then, that although the original entries of the

bank had been certified by the accountant, the transcription of those entries that

was produced in Court carried no certification. Basnayake C.J. correctly held that

the statement was inadmissible in as much as it is a mandatory requirement under

Page 15 of 18

Section 90C, that what is produced in Court should be certified as stipulated in

Section 90A of the Evidence Ordinance.”

In Chandra Gunasekara (ibid.), the certificate read as follows:

““I, Uttumalebbe Ali Mohamed, Chief Manager-Special Assets Unit do hereby

certify that the foregoing statement is a true extract of the relevant entries relating

to the current account No. 205002 of Wang Lanka Apparels (Pvt) Ltd., No. 86, Sea

Beach Road, Colombo 11 as appearing in the books of the People’s bank and that

such entries are contained in one of the ordinary books of the Bank and were made

in the usual or ordinary course of business and that such books are still in the

custody of the Bank..”

Initially, the certificate was marked subject to proof. Subsequently, the author who placed

the certification at the foot of the document had given evidence. According to witness it

was he who had the prepared the statement of account with the aid of entries in the

ledgers maintained by the Bank.

In these circumstances, Aluwihare, P.C., J. held that there is sufficient compliance with the

certification prescribed in Section 90A of the Evidence Ordinance and as such the principle

laid down in Agostinu (supra) is not applicable to that case.

Section 90A of the Evidence Ordinance as amended reads as follows:

'certified copy' means a copy of any entry in the books of a bank, together with a

certificate written at the foot of such copy that it is a true copy of such entry; that

such entry is contained in one of the ordinary books of the bank, and was made in

the usual and ordinary course of business; and that such book is still in the custody

of the bank, such certificate being dated and subscribed by the principal accountant

or manager of the bank with his name and official title and where the bankers'

books consist of data stored by electronic, magnetic, optical or other means in an

Page 16 of 18

information system, includes a printout of such data together with an affidavit

made in accordance with section 6 of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act, No. 14

of 1995, or such other document of certification as may be prescribed in terms of

any law for the time being in force relating to the tendering of computer evidence

before any court or tribunal.” (emphasis added)

The Respondent marked the statement of account as P5B. It has the following certificate:

“We hereby certify that the foregoing is a true and accurate extract of entries

maintained in the account of Snap-R coatings & Chemicals International (Pvt) Ltd in

the books of Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC maintained by the said company in

the usual and ordinary course of the business of the said company which are still in

the custody of the said company.”

The second witness for the Respondent, Mr. Prasanna Devaka Ferdinando, Senior

Manager, Lease Recoveries is the person who prepared P5B. He testified that P5B has

been verified and checked by himself. Therefore, the statement of account P5B is in

accordance with the Sections 90A and 90C of the Evidence Ordinance. The probative

value of this document has proved, on a balance of probability, the total outstanding due.

Conclusion

The Guarantee admittedly signed by the 2nd defendant, is clear and unambiguous. By its

terms, he agreed to be treated as a principal debtor and authorized the Respondent to

sue him in the first instance. The Respondent has validly exercised its right by initiating

this action against the 2nd Defendant to claim the amount due on the Lease Agreement.

For all the foregoing reasons, I affirm the judgment delivered by the Commercial High

Court dated 02.09.2013.

The appeal is dismissed.

The 2nd Defendant shall pay the Respondent as Rs. 2,00,000/= as costs of this appeal.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

P. Padman Surasena, C.J.,

I have had the privilege of going through the Judgment of Hon. Justice Janak De Silva in

draft form. Hon. Justice Janak De Silva has set out the factual matrix of this case.

As stated by Hon. Justice Janak De Silva in his Judgment under the sub-heading

‘Admissibility’, the final point urged by the learned Counsel for the 2nd Defendant is that

the Plaintiff has failed to prove the amount of money due to it from the 2nd Defendant.

I observe that the Plaintiff has produced the document marked P5B in this regard. The

Plaintiff has also called one Prasanna Devaka Fernando, as a witness to give evidence on

its behalf. He is the senior manager lease recoveries. He has established that the contents

of P5B were verified and checked by him. Thus, I am also of the view that P5B can be

admitted under Sections 90A and 90C of the Evidence Ordinance.

I agree with the reasons and conclusions reached by Hon. Justice Janak De Silva with

regard to the other arguments advanced by the Appellant.

I am also in agreement with the final conclusion reached by Hon. Justice Janak De Silva.

Hence, I also agree that the Judgment delivered by the Commercial High Court dated 02-

09-2013 must stand affirmed. Therefore, I also agree that this appeal must be dismissed.

I also agree that the 2nd Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff Rs. 200,000 (Rupees Two Hundred

Thousand) as costs of this action.

I have had the benefit of reading the draft judgment of Hon. Justice Janak De Silva and the

opinion expressed by His Lordship, the Chief Justice.

I am in agreement with the opinion expressed by Justice De Silva on the three grounds

urged by the learned counsel for the 2nd Defendant.

I am also of the view that the document P5B is admissible under Section 90A and 90C of

the Evidence Ordinance.
