"The said conduct of the wife supports the contention of the Plaintiff-Respondent"
"that the Defendant-Appellant has intended to terminate the marriage consortium"
"by the time."
"It   was   the   act   of   the   Defendant-Appellant   prevented   the   entry   of   Plaintiff-"
"Respondent by locking the gate of the compound which the matrimonial house"
"stood which culminated in the act of desertion which left her spouse no reasonable"
"alternative other than to depart from the matrimonial home."
"For the foregoing, I am of the view that the conduct of the Defendant-Appellant"
"amply reveals her desire to terminate the marriage consortium between the parties"
"and learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeal are correct in holding that"
"the   learned   District   Judge   had   not   given   sufficient   reasons   to   arrive   at   the"
"conclusion   that   the   Defendant-Appellant   has   not   committed   any   matrimonial"
"offense on her part."
"Has Adultery on the part of Plaintiff-Respondent been Established?"
"The Defendant-Appellant contends that Plaintiff-Respondent’s adulterous conduct"
"as   the   reason   for   the   breakdown   of   their   marriage.   However,   the   Defendant-"
"Appellant’s answer did not contain a cross claim for a divorce on the ground of"
"adultery and merely stated that no cause of action has accrued in favour of the"
"Plaintiff-Respondent against the Defendant-Appellant."
"Further   there   were   several   contradictions   in   the   statements   of   the   Defendant-"
"Appellant   where   Defendant-Appellant   first   accused   the   Plaintiff-Respondent   of"
"having an affair with one Chitra at the beginning of the cross examination and in"
"the latter part of the cross examination it was suggested that he was having an"
"affair with one Kumarihamy."
