"p.282],   ‘In   my   opinion,   the   party   who   intends   bringing   the"
"cohabitation   to   an   end,   and   whose   conduct   in   reality   causes   its"
"termination, commits the act of desertion. There is no substantial"
"difference between the case of a husband who intends to put an end"
"to a state of cohabitation, and does so by leaving his wife, and that"
"of a husband who with the like intent obliges his wife to separate"
"from him.’. This led Lord Merriman to pithily observe in LANE vs."
"LANE [1951 P 284 at p.286] ‘Desertion is proved if the husband"
"leaves the home, or drives the wife away from the home, with intent"
"to bring the home to an end and without her consent or fault. It does"
"not matter, therefore, on which side of the front door, so to speak, the"
"spouses are found when they part.’.”"
