"that  District   Judge   misdirected   by   analysing   the   evidence   regarding   the   child"
"fathered by the Plaintiff-Respondent as a result of an adulterous affair and setting"
"aside the order of the District Judge on the ground that he had misdirected himself"
"to the conclusion."
"For the foregoing reasons, both the questions of law are answered in negative."
"I, accordingly, set aside the judgment and decree of the learned District Judge and"
"order that Decree nisi be entered dissolving the marriage between the Plaintiff-"
"Respondent and the Defendant-Appellant on the grounds of constructive malicious"
"desertion of the Defendant-Appellant."
"The judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal be accordingly varied."
"Parties must bear their own costs."
