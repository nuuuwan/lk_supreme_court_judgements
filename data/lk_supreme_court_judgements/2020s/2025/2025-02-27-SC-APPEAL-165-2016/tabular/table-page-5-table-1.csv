SC/APPEAL/165/2016"
"ceased  in  1990.  By  the  time  the  present  action  was  instituted,  the"
"defendants had already acquired prescriptive title to the land."
"Amidst  this  position,  the  plaintiff  asserts  that  the  defendants  initially"
"commenced  possession  as  licensees.  However,  no  evidence  has  been"
"adduced to substantiate this claim."
"The plaintiff then puts forward a convoluted argument, claiming that the"
"land was vested in the Land Reform Commission, later reacquired by him,"
"and that the defendants could not have prescribed to the land during the"
"period 
it 
remained  vested 
in 
the  Land  Reform  Commission.  The"
"defendants  do  not  claim  to  have  prescribed  against  the  Land  Reform"
"Commission. 
If 
the 
land 
indeed 
belonged 
to 
the 
Land  Reform"
"Commission,  how  did 
the  plaintiff 
file  multiple 
actions 
seeking"
"declarations  of  title  and  the  ejectment  of  the  defendants?  The  plaintiff"
"instituted these actions on the basis that he owned the land. The plaintiff"
"cannot blow hot and cold."
"There is ample evidence that the defendants have been in possession of"
"the land for a considerable period of time without recognising any rights"
"of the plaintiff over it."
"I answer the question of law “Whether the defendants had discharged the"
"burden  of  establishing  the  prescriptive  claim  required  in  law  in  the"
"circumstances of the case?” in the affirmative. There is no necessity to"
"address  the  remaining  questions  of  law.  The  judgments  of  the  District"
"Court  and  the  High  Court  are  affirmed,  and  the  appeal  is  dismissed"
"without costs."
