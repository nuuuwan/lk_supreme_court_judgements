"both 
the 
original  Defendant 
and 
the 
Substituted  Defendant-Appellant-Appellant"
"consistently viewed the Plaintiff as a licensee. The Defendant contends that, due to the"
"Plaintiff’s  failure  to  meet  the  conditions  of  Agreement  ‘Pa  2’  or  complete  the  sale  as"
"stipulated, the leave and license granted to the Plaintiff were automatically revoked. The"
"Defendant  asserts  that an  individual  who  takes  possession  under  an  ‘agreement  to  sell’"
"holds the status of a licensee. Consequently, the Defendant claims that the learned High"
"Court Judge erred in both law and fact."
"It  is  important  to  note  that  no  specific  issue  has  been  framed  at  the  trial  to  determine"
"whether the Plaintiff occupied the subject premises under a leave and license granted by"
"the  Defendant.  However,  the  issue  No.23  framed  on  behalf  of  the  Defendant  queries"
"whether the Plaintiff has the legal right to remain on the subject property, to which the"
"learned District Judge responded that the Plaintiff does have a legal right. It is a puzzle"
"how  the  Trial  Judge  dismissing  the  Plaintiff’s  action  answered  the  said  issue  No.23  in"
"favour of the Plaintiff. As previously stated, the Plaintiff fails to offer sufficient justification"
"for  his  right  to  continue  occupying  the  property,  given  that  he  breached  the  conditions"
"outlined in Agreement ‘Pa 2’. The prescriptive title is not an issue in the action before the"
"District Court, but the whole claim of the Plaintiff derives from the Agreement marked"
"‘Pa 2’. I am of the view that there is no additional evidence which provides the Plaintiff"
"potential  legal  entitlement  to  possess  the  property  beyond  the  contractual  relationship"
"outlined in Agreement ‘Pa 2’."
"Notably,  no  evidence  was  presented  during 
the 
trial 
to  suggest 
that 
the  Plaintiff’s"
"possession was based on any basis other than the Agreement marked ‘Pa 2’. On the other"
"hand, there is no mutual acknowledgement between the Defendant and the Plaintiff, who"
"are  in  occupation  of  each  other’s  rights  and  duties  for  the  period  until  the  contractual"
"obligations  under  ‘Pa  2’  are  fully  and  effectively  fulfilled.  It  is  observed  that  the  said"
"agreement cannot now be enforced in law due to the failure of the Plaintiff to meet the"
"conditions therein.  The evidence led by the Defendant at the Trial stating that he allowed"
"the Plaintiff to occupy the premises on trust has not been effectively contradicted by the"
"Plaintiff. Hence, I take the view that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider"
"the factual circumstances surrounding the permission granted by the original Defendant"
"(or  the  Substituted  Defendant-Appellant-Appellant)  for  the  Plaintiff  to  enter  in  to  the"
"possession  of  the  ground  floor  unit  of  the  subject  premises  on  the  day  of  the  said"
"Agreement. In the circumstances, I take the view that the Plaintiff has no legal right to be"
