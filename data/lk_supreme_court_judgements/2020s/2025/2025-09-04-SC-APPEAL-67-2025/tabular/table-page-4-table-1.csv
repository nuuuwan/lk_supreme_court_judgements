"includes a two-story building-premises bearing assessment No. 24 and No.25. Moreover,"
"the Plaintiff alleges that the original Defendant agreed to sell the ground floor of the said"
"subject property for a consideration of Rs. 2,700,000 and accordingly, he entered into the"
"said  Agreement,  dated 02.11.2006,  marked  ‘Pa  2’,  with  the  original  Defendant  and  the"
"Substituted Defendant-Appellant-Appellant. As per the terms and conditions of the said"
"Agreement, the Defendant, together with her husband (the original Defendant), accepted"
"a sum of Rs. 500,000 on the same date as partial payment of the total purchase price. The"
"above  averments  of  the  Plaint  have  been  admitted  by  the  Defendant  in  her  Amended"
"Answer."
"The Plaintiff, in view of the said Agreement marked ‘Pa 2’, undertook to pay the balance"
"purchase price (Rs. 2,200,000) on or before 25.03.2007. In terms of Clause 9 of ‘Pa 2’, the"
"Defendant  is  entitled  to  cancel  the  Agreement  with  notice  in  writing  in  the  event  the"

"advance payment will be forfeited should the Plaintiff fail to comply with the Agreement’s"
"obligations.  The  said  Agreement  marked  ‘Pa  2’  contains  several  spelling  mistakes  or"
"typographical errors, but its contents remain comprehensible upon plain reading."
"The Plaintiff states that he moved into the downstairs unit of the said premises on the same"
"day  the  Agreement  ‘Pa  2’  was  signed.  According  to  the  Defendant,  the  Plaintiff  was"
"permitted to occupy the said downstairs unit purely upon the confidence placed in him,"
"although the Defendant was only obliged to transfer the possession of the said premises"
"after  the  conditions  of  the  said  Agreement  were  fully  met.  It  is  noted  that  there  is  no"
"specific provision in the said Agreement which permits the Plaintiff to occupy the premises"
"until he fulfils his obligations under the Agreement. Despite making several subsequent"
"payments to the Defendant, the Plaintiff did not complete, as agreed, the total transaction"
"by 25.03.2007. As such the Defendant has not taken steps to transfer the property to the"
"Plaintiff. Accordingly, in the District Court, the Plaintiff has prayed for an order of the"
"court compelling the Defendant to transfer possession of the property upon receipt of the"
"outstanding balance of Rs. 1,200,000."
"The  Defendant  states  that  the  subject  premises  were  duly  gifted  to  her  by  her  husband"
"through  the  Deed  of  Gift  No.10165,  attested  by  S.  Daimanuwan  Notary  Public,  on"
"24.11.2000.  As  a  result,  the  learned  District  Judge  in  his  Judgement  dated  21.02.2019"
