"in  possession  of  the  subject  property,  given  that  he  has  admittedly  failed  to  meet  the"
"conditions of the said Agreement.  Therefore, the issue No.23 formulated during the Trial"
"should be answered by concluding that the Plaintiff has no right to remain in possession"
"of the property."
"Thus, I take the view that the learned High Court Judge’s conclusion that the issue of leave"
"and license was “strange” to the case was deemed a legal error because it failed to consider"
"evidence  tied  to  Agreement  ‘Pa  2.’  It  misapplies  or  misinterprets  the  law  in  reaching  a"
"decision  on  leave  and  licence  as  well  as  on  the  principles  relating  to  “approbation  and"
"reprobation” (the terms used by the learned High Court Judge). Based on the foregoing"
"reasons,  I  agree  only  with  the  analysis  regarding  jus  retentionis  and  the  corresponding"
"portion of the High Court Judgment that varied the District Court’s decision. However, I"
"am unable to accept the other component of the Judgement of the High Court, particularly"
"its conclusions regarding whether the Plaintiff occupied the property under a leave and"
"license granted by the Defendant. Considering the totality of evidence and circumstances,"
"I answer the 1st question of law in the affirmative."
