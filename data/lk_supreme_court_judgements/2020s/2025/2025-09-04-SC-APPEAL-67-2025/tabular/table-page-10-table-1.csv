"“In a declaration of title action which is not a rei vindicatio proper and which is filed against"
"a defendant such as a licensee or a tenant to recover possession, the plaintiff need not prove"
"title to the land against the defendant. In such actions, the title is presumed to be with the"
"plaintiff."
"Put differently, the defendant in such actions cannot frustrate the plaintiff's action on the basis"
"that the plaintiff is not the owner of the property."
"The present action is not a rei vindicatio action proper but a declaration of title action. Hence,"
"the High Court is clearly wrong to have set aside the judgment of the District Court on the"
"basis that the plaintiff does not have title to the entirety of the land but only to 11/12 shares"
"of the land."
"Once the Court decides that the defendant is a licensee of the plaintiff, and his prescriptive"
"title is unsustainable, whether the plaintiff is the owner of the entire land or part of it or has"
"no title at all is irrelevant.”"
