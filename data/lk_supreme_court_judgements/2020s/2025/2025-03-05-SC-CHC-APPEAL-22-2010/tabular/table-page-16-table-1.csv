"set-off against  Vanik’s  debts. D1 written by Vanik’s  CEO has not  been copied to the"
"Plaintiff.  Thus,  Vanik’s 
intimation 
to  the  Defendant  Bank 
that 
the  monies 
in  the"
"deposits are made in the  name  of the  Plaintiff and it can be held as a lien for Vanik’s"
"debts was not copied to the Plaintiff Bank  and there is no proof that the Plaintiff knew"
"that.  CEO of Vanik  has no  authority  to create a lien or right  to set off  over Plaintiffs"
"money.  Even  though, 
an  attempt  was  made 
to  indicate  that 
there  was  a  tripartite"
"agreement  between  parties,  other 
than  negotiations  with 
regard 
to  100Mn  Bank"
"Guarantee  where the  Plaintiff  had  mentioned  certain  requirements  must  be fulfilled"
"prior to giving  such  Guarantee,  there is nothing  proved to show at least there  was an"
"agreement  between Vanik  and the  Plaintiff  to create such  lien. Vanik’s  CEO was the"
"one  who  communicated 
to  the  Defendant  Bank 
that  it  had  deposited  its  money 
in"
"Plaintiff’s name and can hold in lien for Vanik’s debts. His evidence that  may  indicate"
"that  there  was telephone  conversation  in that  regard  cannot  be trusted.  On  the  other"
"hand, such  an agreement  should be between Defendant  Bank  and the Plaintiff, and no"
"one  from  the  Defendant  Bank  has  given  evidence  in  that  regard.  On  behalf  of  the"
"Defendant  Bank, it is brought to the notice of this Court that one Sunil Mendis who was"
"a signatory  to  some  of  the  communications  marked  was not  called by  the  Plaintiff."
"When  nothing  was  highlighted  as  evidence  whether  he  was alive,  available in  the"
"country  or still an employee of the Plaintiff during the time the evidence was recorded,"
"it cannot  be considered as causing  adverse effect on the  Plaintiff’s case. On the  other"
"hand, when there is proof of a time deposit, it has to be paid at its maturity.  If there is a"
"lien or any  other right  that  stops the  payment,  it is the  Defendant  Bank  which should"
"prove the existence of such encumbrances."
