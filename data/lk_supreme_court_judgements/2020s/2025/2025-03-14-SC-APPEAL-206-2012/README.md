SC/APPEAL/206/2012

Samayawardhena, J.

This case has a history spanning thirty years. The plaintiff filed this

action against the defendant in the District Court of Gampaha by plaint

dated 08.08.1995 seeking, inter alia, a declaration that he was the

Viharadhipathy of Jinaraja Viharaya in Veyangoda, and the recovery of

damages from the defendant until the plaintiff is restored to possession.

The defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action on

the basis that he had been in lawful possession of the temple. In the

answer the defendant took up the position that the premises in suit was

gifted to Paththalagedara Sri Ubhayalokartha Saadhaka Bauddha

Samithiya by deed No. 115 of 03.05.1915. After a lengthy trial, the

District Court pronounced the judgment dated 05.05.1997 in favour of

the plaintiff. The District Judge held that the plaintiff was entitled to evict

the defendant from the temple and to recover possession and damages.

Although the defendant appealed against this judgment to the Court of

Appeal, the appeal was abated by the Court of Appeal on 21.02.2003, as

no steps were taken to prosecute the appeal after the death of the

defendant. The original case record was returned to the District Court.

The decree was then entered in the District Court and the order to

execute the writ was made. When the Fiscal went to the premises with

the original plaintiff on 25.09.2003 to deliver possession to the plaintiff,

another priest, namely, Rev. Parakandeniye Dhammathilaka, had been in

possession of the temple who had told the Fiscal that he was in

possession of the temple with the permission of the Dayaka Sabhawa.

The members of the Dayaka Sabhawa/Bauddha Samithiya have resisted

the Fiscal in executing the writ. The Fiscal reported this to Court by

report dated 29.09.2003 with the names of those members of the Dayaka

Sabhawa.

3

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

The plaintiff-judgment creditor made an application to the District Court

dated 21.10.2003 under section 325 of the Civil Procedure Code making

those persons mentioned in the Fiscals report who resisted the execution

of the writ as respondents. The 2nd to 6th respondents were respectively

the chairman and the office bearers of the said Dayaka Sabhawa. The

District Court dismissed the claim of the Dayaka Sabhawa by order

dated 29.07.2004. On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed this order by

Judgment dated 19.10.2007.

In the meantime, the original plaintiff passed away on 23.11.2005 and

the District Court substituted the present substituted plaintiff in his

place by order dated 08.12.2008.

Thereafter, the substituted plaintiff made an application to the District

Court dated 23.11.2009 seeking to reissue the writ, after appointing

another priest, namely, Rev. Omalpe Somananda Thero, who was at that

time allegedly in unlawful possession of the temple, an executor de son

tort, for the purpose of the execution of the decree in terms of section

341(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. The District Judge, by order dated

25.11.2009, appointed Rev. Omalpe Somananda Thero as the executor de

son tort and reissued the writ.

When the Fiscal repaired to the premises to execute the writ of possession

on 26.04.2010, he had again been resisted by a large number of people.

The entrance gate to the temple had been padlocked. The Fiscal reported

this to Court by report dated 26.04.2010.

Thereupon, by order dated 10.05.2010, the District Judge directed the

execution of the writ by breaking open the padlocks. When the Fiscal

proceeded to the premises on 03.06.2010, an Attorney-at-Law informed

the Fiscal that he was resisting the execution of the writ in terms of

section 325(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. Consequently, the Fiscal

4

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

returned to Court with the writ unexecuted and submitted a report dated

03.06.2010.

It is against this backdrop, Rev. Omalpe Somananda Thero, who was

allegedly in unlawful possession of the temple, filed a revision application

before the High Court of Civil Appeal of Gampaha on 21.05.2010, seeking

to set aside the order of the District Court dated 25.11.2009 whereby he

was appointed as the executor de son tort for the purpose of executing the

writ. His primary contention was that the said order had been made ex

parte without affording him an opportunity to be heard.

According to paragraph 15 of the petition tendered to the High Court, he

came to know that he had been appointed as the executor de son tort in

the action only when the Fiscal visited the premises to execute the writ.

The petitioner reiterates this fact in page 3 of the pre-argument written

submissions dated 28.02.2013 and in page 6 of the post-argument

written submissions filed in this Court. He obtained a stay order from the

High Court staying execution of the writ. After inquiry, the High Court

dismissed the revision application by Judgment dated 08.03.2011. This

appeal with leave obtained by Ven. Omalpe Somananda Thero (hereinafter

the appellant) is against the said Judgment of the High Court.

This is yet another textbook case of the abuse of the execution procedure

to deprive the judgment-creditor of the fruits of his victory. Despite the

judgment of the District Court having been delivered 28 years ago, the

plaintiff has still been unable to execute the writ.

In my view, on the facts and circumstances of this case, the High Court

should not have entertained the revision application mainly on two

reasons.

If the complaint of the appellant was that the order of the District Court

dated 25.11.2009 was made against him without giving him a hearing,

5

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

he ought to have first made the application to the District Court which

made the ex parte order. He could go before the High Court only if he was

dissatisfied with that order. He could not have straightaway gone before

the High Court against the original ex parte order. This is the settled law.

In Andradie v. Jayasekera Perera [1985] 2 Sri LR 204, a decree entered

in a divorce suit was sought to be set aside before the Court of Appeal by

way of an application for revision and/or restitutio in integrum on the

ground that summons was never served on the petitioner. Upholding the

preliminary objection taken on behalf of the respondent and dismissing

the application in limine, Siva Selliah J., citing a spate of earlier

authorities held:

The practice has grown and almost hardened into a rule that where

a decree has been entered ex parte in a District Court and is sought

to be set aside on any ground, application must in the first instance

be made to that very Court and that it is only where the finding of

the District Court on such application is not consistent with reason

or the proper exercise of the Judges discretion or where he has

misdirected himself on the facts or law that the Court of Appeal will

grant the extraordinary relief by way of Revision or Restitutio in

Integrum.

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd v. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd [1987] 1 Sri

LR 5, Atukorale J. with the agreement of Sharvananda C.J. and H.A.G.

de Silva J. held:

A party seeking to canvass an order entered ex-parte against him

must apply in the first instance to the court which made it. This is a

rule of practice which has become deeply ingrained in our legal

system.

6

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

In arriving at this conclusion, Atukorale J. cited Loku Menika v.

Selenduhamy (1947) 48 NLR 353, Habibu Lebbe v. Punchi Etana (1894) 3

CLR 85, Caldera v. Santiagopulle (1920) 22 NLR 155 at 158, Weeratne v.

Secretary, D.C. Badulla (1920) 2 C L Rec 180, Dingirihamy v. Don Bastian

(1962) 65 NLR 549, Bank of Ceylon v. Liverpool Marine & General

Insurance Co Ltd (1962) 66 NLR 472, Nagappan v. Lankabarana Estates

Ltd (1971) 75 NLR 488 in support.

In Penchi v. Sirisena [2012] 1 Sri LR 402 at 408 and Jana Shakthi

Insurance v. Dasanayake [2005] 1 Sri LR at 299 303, Wimalachandra J.

also emphasized this important principle in law. In the latter case it was

held:

It is settled law that a party affected by an order of which he had no

notice must apply in the first instance to the Court which made the

order. The petitioner must first file the necessary papers in the

original Court and initiate an inquiry into the allegations made by

him. After such inquiry, if the petitioner is dissatisfied with the order

made by the District Court, he can thereafter raise the matter before

the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal then would be in a position

to make an order on the issues after taking into consideration the

order made by the District Court.

In addition to the abovementioned reason, there was another valid reason

for the High Court not to have entertained the revision application. It is

settled law that when there is an effective alternative remedy recognized

by law, the Appellate Court is loath to exercise revisionary jurisdiction

which is reserved to deal with extraordinary situations. In this case, there

was no such extraordinary situation which warranted the High Court to

intervene by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction by way of revision.

The reason is, if the Fiscal comes to execute the writ, the law provides for

the appellant to resist the execution by convincing the Fiscal on prima

7

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

facie basis that he is not bound by the decree. If the Fiscal accepts it, he

can report it to Court without executing the writ. If the Fiscal is not

satisfied, he can execute the writ, and the appellant can make an

application to Court to restore him to possession. These steps are

outlined in sections 324-328 of the Civil Procedure Code. I have

discussed the applicability of these provisions in detail in Mohamed

Fawsan v. Majeed Mohamed (SC/APPEAL/135/2017, SC Minutes of

31.03.2023) and therefore do not wish to reiterate them here.

In this case, the Fiscal could not execute the writ on three separate

occasions because certain individuals informed him that they were

resisting its execution. On one occasion, an Attorney-at-Law informed the

Fiscal of this, and on each occasion, the Fiscal returned the writ

unexecuted. This is based on the popular view that when the Fiscal goes

to execute the writ and if he encounters resistance, it is his duty to report

the resistance to the Court with the writ unexecuted. This is a

misconception. Section 324 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

324(1) Upon receiving the writ the Fiscal or his officer shall as soon

as reasonably may be repair to the ground, and there deliver over

possession of the property described in the writ to the judgment-

creditor or to some person appointed by him to receive delivery on

his behalf, and if need be by removing any person bound by the

decree who refuses to vacate the property:

Provided that as to so much of the property, if any, as is in the

occupancy of a tenant or other person entitled to occupy the same as

against the judgment-debtor, and not bound by the decree to

relinquish such occupancy, the Fiscal or his officer shall give delivery

by affixing a copy of the writ in some conspicuous place on the

property and proclaiming to the occupant by beat of tom-tom, or in

8

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

such other mode as is customary, at some convenient place, the

substance of the decree in regard to the property; and

Provided also that if the occupant can be found, a notice in writing

containing the substance of such decree shall be served upon him,

and in such case no proclamation need be made.

(2) The cost (to be fixed by the court) of such proclamation shall in

every case be prepaid by the judgment-creditor.

Once the Court issues the writ of execution to the Fiscal, section 324(1)

authorizes the Fiscal to deliver possession either to the judgment-creditor

or his nominee if need be by removing any person bound by the decree

who refuses to vacate the property. However, if there is a tenant or other

person entitled to occupy the same as against the judgment-debtor, the

Fiscal can deliver constructive or symbolic possession.

Merely because a party to the action or a third party objects to the

execution of the writ, the Fiscal should not abdicate his duty and return

the writ unexecuted. The objection shall be well-founded and the Fiscal

shall be prima facie satisfied that there is a bona fide claim and that it is

not a sham to frustrate the execution of the writ. The execution of a

decree is not a retrial, nor should it be an ordeal. It is the process of

translating the decree into reality allowing the winner to reap the fruits

of his victory.

In Tyagarajah v. Perera [1983] 1 Sri LR 384 at 391, Soza J. with the

concurrence of Sharvananda J. and Colin-Thome J. made this clear in

the following terms:

At the outset it is well to remember that in execution proceedings the

statutory procedures are so designed as to assist the

judgment-creditor to recover the fruits of his judgment and not to

9

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

afford facilities to the judgment-debtor to defeat or delay the

execution of the decree of court. Hence the general principle is that

notice is not required of an application for execution of a decree. The

application for execution should conform to the requirements of

section 224 of the Civil Procedure Code (Form 42 of the First

Schedule to the Code). There is a stipulation to mention the names

of the parties but no petition to which any party is named respondent

is necessary.

In the Supreme Court case of Weliwitigoda v. U.D.B. De Silva [1997] 1 Sri

LR 51, at the time of execution of the writ, the 1st respondent made a

claim on tenancy but did not support it with documentary evidence. The

Fiscal executed the writ and delivered possession of the premises to the

appellant. The Court of Appeal quashed the writ of execution. On appeal

to the Supreme Court, whilst setting aside the judgment of the Court of

Appeal, Kulatunga J. (with the agreement of G.P.S. De Silva C.J. and

Ramanathan J.) rightly pointed out that, in the execution of the decree,

the Fiscal need not surrender to resistance as a matter of course but do

so only if there is a prima facie case made out by the party resisting. This

was explained at page 55 as follows:

The powers of Fiscal in executing a writ are set out in S.324 of the

Code which requires him to deliver possession of the property to the

judgment creditor if need be by removing any person bound by the

decree who refuses to vacate the property. However, if there is a

tenant or other person entitled to occupy the same as against the

judgment-debtor, and not bound by the decree to relinquish such

occupancy the Fiscal can only give symbolic possession viz. by

affixing a copy of the writ on the property and taking other steps,

required by the proviso to S.324.

10

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

As regards the requirement to give symbolic possession, it does not

appear that the Fiscal is bound to do so on the basis of a mere claim

of tenancy, which is not in any way supported by facts. Such a

claimant may become liable to removal as an agent, servant or other

person, bound by the decree. The 1st respondent was not residing on

the premises in dispute. His claim was that he was a sub-tenant

under the judgment debtor and in that capacity used some of the

buildings on the premises to conduct a school. However, he has not

placed any material before the Fiscal to support that claim. If so, he

became liable to be removed, in view of his empty claim subject,

however, to his right to make an application under S.328 of the Code.

It seems to me that the 1st respondent acted in the belief that if he

merely claimed to be a tenant the Fiscal was ipso facto barred from

giving the appellant vacant possession of the property; and that if

the Fiscal then attempted to remove him, he was entitled to resist,

whereupon the Fiscal ought to have reported such resistance to

Court. If this were the law and the occupants have such a right to

resist execution, effective execution of writs would indeed be

impeded. I am of the view that a claim under the proviso to S.324

cannot be entertained unless it is prima facie tenable.

Let me now consider the status of the appellant in the instant case afresh.

According to the document marked X1B tendered by the appellant

himself with the leave to appeal application filed in this Court dated

18.04.2011 and page 6 of the pre-argument written submissions of the

appellant dated 28.02.2013, the appellant is in occupation of the temple

as the trustee of the Baudda Samithiya in which the office bearers were

the 2nd to 6th respondents in the section 325 application, which I

mentioned previously. The said letter X1B appointing the appellant as

the trustee of the temple has been signed by the 2nd respondent to the

11

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

section 325 application. It may be recalled that the said 2nd to 6th

respondents application was dismissed by the District Court and the

Court of Appeal affirmed it. This purported appointment as the trustee of

the temple was made even after the Fiscal had gone to the premises for

the third time to hand over possession after breaking open the padlock

of the entrance gate to the premises. It is this appointment that provided

the appellant with the locus standi to file the revision application in the

High Court. The revision application was filed by the appellant about one

month after the said appointment. It is clear that the appellant is a

nominee or an agent of the said respondents. The appellant has no

independent survival. He cannot reagitate the matter and argue that a

separate action shall be filed to evict him from the premises.

The appellant did not make the application to the District Court nor did

he make the said 2nd respondent whom he says appointed him as the

trustee of the temple, a party to his application. Instead, he went directly

to the High Court perhaps because he knew his predicament before the

District Court.

Given the unique facts and circumstances of this case, in my view, there

was no necessity to appoint the appellant as the executor de son tort in

order for him to be evicted in the execution of the decree.

Then why did the substituted plaintiff make an application to appoint the

appellant as the executor de son tort? Is the appointment of the appellant

as the executor de son tort wrong in law?

Section 341 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

341(1) If the judgment-debtor dies before the decree has been fully

executed, the holder of the decree may apply to the court which

passed it, by petition, to which the legal representative of the

12

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

deceased shall be made respondent, to execute the same against the

legal representative of the deceased.

(1A) On an application made under subsection (1), the court shall

enter the name of the legal representative on the record in place of

the name of the deceased and shall proceed to determine the

application for execution.

(2) Such representative shall be liable only to the extent of the

property of the deceased which has come to his hands and has not

been duly disposed of; and for the purpose of ascertaining such

liability, the court executing the decree may on the application of the

decree-holder compel the said representative to produce such

accounts as it thinks fit.

(3) If the judgment-creditor dies before the decree has been fully

executed, the legal representative may apply to the court to have his

name entered on the record in place of the deceased and the court

shall thereupon enter his name on the record.

According to section 341(1), when the judgment-debtor dies before the

execution of the decree, the decree holder shall take steps to appoint a

legal representative of the deceased judgment-debtor for the purpose of

the execution of the decree.

I must pause for a while to observe that it is illogical to assume that a

decree holder can only execute the writ if a legal representative of the

deceased judgment-debtor exists, but he cannot execute the writ if there

are no legal representatives.

According to section 338 of the Civil Procedure Code, as amended, in

general terms, a legal representative means an executor or administrator

or in the case of an estate below the value of four million rupees, the next

13

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

of kin who have adiated the inheritance. In the event of a dispute as to

who is the legal representative, the Court shall decide it.

However, in execution of the decree upon the death of the judgment-

debtor, the rigid application of the law is relaxed. In the result, even a

stranger in possession of the property in suit who does not claim under

the judgment-debtor may be appointed as the legal representative for the

purpose of section 341(1) of the Civil Procedure Code depending on the

facts and circumstances of the case.

In Simon v. Gunatilake [2005] 1 Sri LR 249 the plaintiff filed action

seeking ejectment of the 1st defendant from the land in suit. After trial,

the District Judge entered judgment for the plaintiff. Pending appeal, the

1st defendant died and the application to substitute the petitioners in the

room of the deceased 1st defendant was objected to, on the basis that they

were not children of the deceased 1st defendant. The District Judge did

not accept that position and the substitution was allowed. On appeal,

Wimalachandra J. affirmed the decision of the District Judge and

explained the law at page 253 as follows:

Sarkars Law of Civil Procedure, 8th edition, Volume 1, at page 220

has made the following observation on the Indian section 50(1)

which is identical to ours: A stranger in possession of deceased

judgement-debtors property but who claims no title from him may

be proceeded against in execution as legal representative under

section 50 [Baliram v. Mukinda (A 1951 N 145)

The property possessed by the judgement-debtor is now in the

hands of the petitioner (1st to 3rd substituted defendants). It seems

to me that they come within the meaning of section 341(1), as the

legal representatives of the deceased 1st defendant. The legal

14

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

representative includes any person who intermeddles with the

estate of the deceased.

In the instant case, there are no legal representatives to the deceased as

defined in section 338 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appeal of the

deceased defendant was abated by the Court of Appeal as nobody was

forthcoming to prosecute the appeal.

An executor de son tort, meaning, an executor of his own wrong, is a legal

fiction. He is someone who wrongfully interferes with the deceaseds

estate or assumes the office of executor without legal basis. He has all

the liabilities but none of the privileges attached to a duly constituted

executor. In Nesaratnam v. Vaithilingam (1975) 78 NLR 457, Pathirana J.

with the agreement of Vythialingam J. held that an executor de son tort

is a legal representative of the deceased within the meaning of section

341(1) of the Civil Procedure Code. In support of this proposition of law,

Pathirana J. cited, inter alia, Prins v. Peiris 4 NLR 353, Arunachalam

Chettiar v. Arunachalam Chettiar (1934) 36 NLR 49 at 51, Perera v.

Pathumma (1919) 21 NLR 76 at 77, Junaid v. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue (1962) 65 NLR 561 and Dahanayake v. Jayasinghe (1966) 71

CLW 112. Pathirana J. further stated at page 468 that The trend seems

to favour an extended meaning to be given to the term executor or

administrator as to include an executor de son tort. Both reason and logic

seem to favour this view, particularly in interpreting section 341 of the Civil

Procedure Code.

In Dahanayake v. Jayasinghe (supra), Sri Skanda Rajah J. with Alles J.

agreeing stated that The legal representative is either the executor or the

administrator, under section 394(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. In our

opinion, an executor also includes executor de son tort. There was ample

evidence to indicate that the appellant intermeddled with her late

husbands estate and thereby constituted herself executrix de son tort.

15

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

On the unique facts and circumstances of this case, the appointment of

the appellant as executor de son tort for the limited purpose of the

execution of the decree in compliance with section 341(1) can be justified

by giving an extended meaning to the term executor de son tort.

In Tyagarajah v. Perera [1983] 1 Sri LR 384, Soza J. with the concurrence

of Sharvananda J. and Colin-Thome J. held that where the judgment-

debtor dies before execution of the decree and where a legal

representative should be substituted for the deceased judgment debtor,

no service of notice on the legal representative is necessary before the

substitution. Substitution and execution should be asked for in one

petition in which the legal representative shall be made respondent.

Substitution will be ex parte and thereafter notice will be issued on the

legal representative although section 341(1) does not mandate to do so.

It is nothing but fair to assume that the provision in section 341 to make

the legal representative a party respondent is to ensure that he receives

notice of the application for execution. Soza J. stated that it is now settled

law that service of notice on the legal representative prior to execution is

mandatory and failure to do so is a fatal irregularity. However, it was

further held that where the legal representative becomes otherwise aware

of the application for execution, the failure to issue notice before issuance

of writ is not fatal.

As pointed out previously, the appellant was appointed as the trustee of

the temple by the 2nd to 6th respondents to the section 325 application.

When the 2nd to 6th respondents unsuccessfully resisted the execution, it

can reasonably be assumed that the appellant was aware of the execution

process initiated by the substituted plaintiff.

Why is notice issued on the legal representative? That is for the legal

representative to show cause why writ shall not be executed against him.

In the instant case, the legal representative (the appellant) has no cause

16

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

to show as he has no independent title or claim other than through the

2nd to 6th respondents. Hence, on the unique facts and circumstances of

this case, the failure to issue notice on the appellant prior to the issuance

of writ is not fatal.

In any event, if the appellant was dispossessed by the execution of the

decree wrongfully, he was not without remedy. Section 328 of the Civil

Procedure Code provides the answer.

328 Where any person other than the judgment-debtor or a person

in occupation under him is dispossessed of any property in execution

of a decree, he may, within fifteen days of such dispossession, apply

to the court by petition in which the judgment-creditor shall be

named respondent complaining of such dispossession. The court

shall thereupon serve a copy of such petition on such respondent

and require such respondent to file objections, if any, within fifteen

days of the service of the petition on him. Upon such objections being

filed or after the expiry of the date on which such objections were

directed to be filed, the court shall, after notice to all parties

concerned, hold an inquiry. Where the court is satisfied that the

person dispossessed was in possession of the whole or part of such

property on his own account or on account of some person other than

the judgment-debtor, it shall by order direct that the petitioner be put

into possession of the property or part thereof, as the case may be.

Every inquiry under this section shall be concluded within sixty days

of the date fixed for the filing of objections.

It is important to understand that there is no place for technical

objections in execution proceedings. This matter was discussed by me in

Mohamed Fawsan v. Majeed Mohamed (supra). In execution proceedings

the Court will only look at the substance and not the form. Even if there

17

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

are minor lapses, if no material prejudice has been caused thereby,

resulting in grave miscarriage of justice, the Court will not intervene.

In Brooke Bond (Ceylon) Ltd v. Gunasekara [1990] 1 Sri LR 71 at 81 it

was observed that the provisions relating to execution proceedings

should not be construed in such a way as to lightly interfere with a

decree-holders right to reap the fruits of his victory as expeditiously as

possible.

In Ekanayake v. Ekanayake [2003] 2 Sri LR 221 at 227, Amaratunga J.

held:

Execution is a process for the enforcement of a decreed right, mere

technicalities shall not be allowed to impede the enforcement of such

rights in the absence of any prejudice to the judgment debtor.

In Nanayakkara v. Sulaiman (1926) 28 NLR 314 at 315, Dalton J.

expressed a similar opinion:

As observed by the Privy Council in Bissesur Lall Sahoo v.

Maharajah Luckmessur Singh (6 Indian Appeals 233) in execution

proceedings, the Court will look at the substance of the transaction,

and will not be disposed to set aside an execution upon merely

technical grounds, when the execution has been found to be

substantially right.

This view has been emphatically endorsed in an array of decisions

including Suppramanium Chetty v. Jayawardene (1922) 24 NLR 50,

Wijewardene v. Raymond (1937) 39 NLR 179 at 181, Latiff v. Seneviratne

Consolidated Ltd. [1981] 2 Sri LR 373.

In Samad v. Zain (1977) 79(2) NLR 557, the plaintiff made five

applications for writ and died while the fifth was pending, resulting in the

execution being stalled. The substituted judgment-creditor filed a sixth

application for writ, which was refused on the ground that the plaintiff

had failed to exercise due diligence to procure execution in the previous

attempts (due diligence was a requirement under section 377 before the

Amendment by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 53 of

1980). Whilst setting aside the order of the District Court on the basis

that section 337 should not be construed strictly against the judgment-

creditor, Wanasundera J. with the concurrence of Tennekoon C.J. and

Rajaratnam J. stated at 563:

The Supreme Court has always been disposed to overlook

technicalities in dealing with execution proceedings. Hearne, J. in

Latiff vs. Seneviratne quoted the words of the Privy Council to the

effect that-

In execution proceedings, the Court will look at the substance of the

transaction, and will not be disposed to set aside an execution upon

merely technical grounds, when the execution has been found to be

substantially right.

We would be interpreting the relevant provisions unduly harshly if

we were to deny the appellant relief in the circumstances of this

case. I would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs both here and

below. The petitioner would be entitled to take out writ of execution

with a view to obtaining satisfaction of the decree of which he is the

assignee.

Before I part with this judgment, let me touch upon one more matter.

After the death of the original plaintiff, the respondent was appointed as

the substituted plaintiff in the District Court. The appellant now attempts

to argue that this substitution was made erroneously through an ex parte

application to the District Court, on the basis that the action is personal

to the original plaintiff and the defendant, and therefore the question of

substitution did not arise. The appellant cannot challenge the validity of

this substitution in these proceedings. If he thought that the substitution

was improper, he should have first raised that matter in the District

Court, rather than hastily going before the High Court to stay the

execution of the writ. In any event, no leave has been granted by this

Court to consider such a question of law.

The questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted and the

answers thereto are as follows:

Q. Did the High Court err in law in holding that the appellant can

be appointed as a legal representative of the deceased

defendant on the basis that the appellant is the executor de son

tort of the deceased defendant?

A. No. On the facts and circumstances of this case, this

appointment could have been made.

Q. Did the High Court fail to consider that the substituted plaintiff

has failed to comply with the provisions of section 341(1) of the

Civil Procedure Code by naming the appellant as a respondent

filed under the said section?

A. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the answer is in

the negative.

Q. Did the High Court err in holding that the appellant was aware

of the application for substitution and execution of writ?

20

SC/APPEAL/206/2012

A. On the facts and circumstances of the case, the answer is in the

negative.

For the aforementioned reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs

payable by the appellant to the substituted plaintiff. The appellant cannot

have an independent claim against the decree holder. If the appellant

does not vacate the premises within two months from today, the Fiscal

shall eject the appellant from the premises and hand over the possession

of the premises to the substituted plaintiff in the execution of the decree.
