SC/APPEAL/206/2012"
"As regards the requirement to give symbolic possession, it does not"
"appear that the Fiscal is bound to do so on the basis of a mere claim"
"of  tenancy,  which  is  not  in  any  way  supported  by  facts.  Such  a"
"claimant may become liable to removal as an agent, servant or other"
"person, bound by the decree. The 1st respondent was not residing on"
"the  premises  in  dispute.  His  claim  was  that  he  was  a  sub-tenant"
"under  the  judgment  debtor  and  in  that  capacity  used  some  of  the"
"buildings on the premises to conduct a school. However, he has not"
"placed any material before the Fiscal to support that claim. If so, he"
"became  liable  to  be  removed,  in  view  of  his  empty  claim  subject,"
"however, to his right to make an application under S.328 of the Code."
"It seems to me that the 1st respondent acted in the belief that if he"
"merely claimed to be a tenant the Fiscal was ipso facto barred from"
"giving the appellant vacant possession of the property; and that if"
"the Fiscal then attempted to remove him, he was entitled to resist,"
"whereupon  the  Fiscal  ought  to  have  reported  such  resistance  to"
"Court. If this were the law and the occupants have such a “right” to"
"resist  execution,  effective  execution  of  writs  would 
indeed  be"
"impeded. I am of the view that a claim under the proviso to S.324"
"cannot be entertained unless it is prima facie tenable."
