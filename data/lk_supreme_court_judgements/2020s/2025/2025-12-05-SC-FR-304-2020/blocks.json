The Pe\u019f\u019foner states further that a\u014cer the said incident, he informed the 4th Respondent that he will not drive the truck in the future to transport sand unless a permit was available. The Pe\u019f\u019foner claims that the 4th Respondent was furious with him over his refusal to drive the truck on such occasions as the 4th Respondent had to employ another driver. 4) According to the Pe\u019f\u019foner, on 1st April 2019 he had taken the truck for repairs in the morning, returned home around 5.45pm and parked the truck on the side of the road close to his house without obstruc\u019fng the tra\ufb03c on the main road.

The Pe\u019f\u019foner had accordingly acceded to the request of the 4th Respondent and slept inside the truck. 5) The Pe\u019f\u019foner states that around 11.50pm, he was rudely woken up and saw two Police Constables and the 1st Respondent, whose name he was aware of, coming towards the truck. He states further that the 1st Respondent had got inside the truck and hit him on the head with a helmet. The Pe\u019f\u019foner claims to have raised cries but the 1st Respondent and another o\ufb03cer had pulled the Pe\u019f\u019foner out of the truck, thrown him to the ground and the 1st Respondent had kicked him on his back and chest. The Pe\u019f\u019foner states that his wife and two children had heard him screaming and arrived at the scene.

It was submi\u01a9ed that visits by lawyers and rela\u019fves were not restricted, and that the Pe\u019f\u019foner had the opportunity to consult lawyers. There are two independent reasons why this conten\u019fon cannot succeed. A remand prisoner cannot contact a lawyer with the same ease and facility as other persons; addi\u019fonal \u019fme has necessarily to be spent in sending messages to, or in awai\u019fng a visit from, a rela\u019fve, who would then have to contact a lawyer; and more \u019fme would be necessary to give proper instruc\u019fons. The period of \u019fme necessary would depend on the circumstances of each case. Here, the Pe\u019f\u019foner was hospitalised from 2.12.87 un\u019fl his release, and was thus prevented from taking immediate ac\u019fon to pe\u019f\u019fon this Court for redress: an impediment, to the exercise of his fundamental right (under Ar\u019fcle 17) to apply to this Court, caused by the very infringement complained of. Further, the fact that he had been assaulted, or that an injury had been in\ufb02icted on him, would not per se bring him within Ar\u019fcle 11; whether the treatment meted out to him would fall within Ar\u019fcle 11 would depend on the nature and extent of the injury caused; un\u019fl the Pe\u019f\u019foner had knowledge, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered, that an injury su\ufb03cient to bring him within Ar\u019fcle 11 had resulted, \u019fme did not begin to run.\u201d [emphasis added]",
