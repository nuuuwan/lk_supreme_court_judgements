ARGUED ON: ​07.07.2025​​ DECIDED ON: 10.12.2025 K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J. The Facts of the Case in Brief

The Petitioner is a citizen of Sri Lanka and a resident of Sinharagama, where

he has lived for over twenty years. The Petitioner is married and has two

adult daughters, though he has been separated from his spouse for some

time. The Petitioner stated that he was engaged in lawful business activities

in the area, including the purchasing, storing, and selling of grains, the

buying and selling of used motor vehicles, and the operation of a small

eatery.

The 1st Respondent was, at the material time, the Officer-in-Charge of the

Divisional Vice Squad of the Anuradhapura Division. The 2nd to 4th

Respondents were officers attached to that same unit and were members of

the police party responsible for the arrest and assault of the Petitioner. The

5th Respondent was the Officer-in-Charge of the Nochchiyagama Police

Station who produced the Petitioner before the Magistrate’s Court of

Thambuththegama. The 6th Respondent was the Acting Inspector General of

Police, responsible for the supervision and discipline of police officers,

including the 1st to 5th Respondents. The 7th Respondent is the Hon.

Attorney General named in terms of Article 134 of the Constitution.

The Petitioner asserted that his arrest and detention were unlawful, without

reasonable cause, and not in compliance with due process. The Petitioner

stated that the Respondents violated his fundamental rights guaranteed

under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1), 13(2), and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

On 14.03.2023, this court granted leave to proceed of the alleged violation of

Article 11 and 12(1) of the Constitution against the 1st to 4th Respondents

and against the 5th Respondent for the violation under Article 12(1). Leave

was not granted against the 6th and 7th Respondents.

​​3

In their Statement of Objections, the 1st to 4th Respondents, as a

preliminary objection, raised that the instant application has been filed

outside the mandatory period prescribed under Article 126(2) of the

Constitution and further, that the Petitioner has failed to invoke the

jurisdiction of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka pursuant to

Section 14 of the Human Rights Commission Act, No. 21 of 1996. The

Respondents therefore contended that the application is liable to be

dismissed in limine.

The Preliminary Objection raised by the 1st to 4th Respondents

In terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution, an application invoking the

fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court must be filed within one month

of the Petitioner becoming aware of the alleged infringement. This

requirement has long been recognised as the general rule, as articulated in

Gunawardena v. Senanayake, FRD Vol. 1 p. 177, where the Court

observed that adherence to the one-month period is integral to the proper

exercise of this Court’s constitutional jurisdiction.

However, this Court has also recognised that the time requirement is not

absolute. The Court retains discretion to entertain an application which is

ex facie outside the one-month period. In exercising that discretion, the

Court must be satisfied that the Petitioner has provided an adequate excuse

for the delay. This principle was affirmed in Edirisuriya v. Navaratnam

(1985) 1 Sri LR 100 at 106, where it was held that the Court may consider

exceptional circumstances preventing timely filing. The rationale for this

discretion is grounded in the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia—the law

does not compel a person to do the impossible.

Turning to the present facts, the alleged infringement occurred on

01.06.2020, and the Petition was filed on 28.09.2020, outside the

one-month period. However, the Petitioner has explained that his daughter

attempted to make a complaint to the Human Rights Commission, but that

the complaint was refused on the ground that the Petitioner must be

personally present to lodge such complaint. The Petitioner was at that time

​​4

in detention and medically unfit to attend personally, as corroborated by the

Medico-Legal Report P3C and the production and case records P3, P3A,

P3B, P4, P5A, P5B and P6, which reflect his physical condition and the

circumstances of his detention. Given these circumstances, the delay is

attributable to the Petitioner’s inability to act personally, rather than to any

neglect or failure on his part. On a consideration of the factual materials

before Court, I am inclined to accept the explanation tendered.

The right claimed by the Petitioner is a fundamental right. Under Article 4(d)

of the Constitution, fundamental rights form part of the sovereignty of the

People and must be respected, secured, and advanced by all organs of

Government. Articles 10 through 14 recognise and declare these rights.

While such rights apply to all persons or citizens, the right to invoke the

jurisdiction of this Court is individual and personal. Article 17 provides that

every person is entitled to apply to this Court for the enforcement of a

fundamental right. Article 126(2) further emphasises this personal character

by requiring that the person alleging infringement must apply himself or by

an Attorney-at-Law on his behalf within one month of the infringement.

The wording of Article 126(2) “he may himself or by an Attorney-at-Law on

his behalf, within one month thereof…” (emphasis added) makes clear that

the constitutional right to seek redress is vested in the individual who

alleges the infringement. This thereby invokes the principle vigilantibus non

dormientibus jura subveniunt—the law assists those who are vigilant, not

those who sleep on their rights. However, the burden of vigilance cannot be

imposed where, due to detention and medical condition, the Petitioner was

factually unable to assert his rights, and where his family made a bona fide

attempt to pursue an administrative remedy before the Human Rights

Commission.

In these circumstances, the lapse of less than under four months, occurring

during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and attendant administrative

disruptions, cannot be deemed a deliberate or negligent failure to assert

rights, nor can it reasonably be construed as the Petitioner having “slept on

​​5

his rights,” particularly in relation to an allegation under Article 11, which

concerns non-derogable protections.

Therefore, the delay is both reasonably explained and justified by reference

to the above principles and authorities. The Petitioner’s conduct does not

amount to acquiescence, negligence, or indifference. Rather, the delay is

directly attributable to circumstances beyond his control, the very situation

to which lex non cogit ad impossibilia speaks. The discretion of this Court is

therefore properly engaged.

Accordingly, based on the factual record and the established jurisprudence,

this Court is entitled to, and in the interests of justice, ought to excuse the

delay and proceed to examine the alleged infringement on its merits. As

such, I overrule the preliminary objection raised by the 1st to 4th

Respondents.

The version of the Petitioner

The Petitioner stated that he is the owner of approximately one and a half

acres of agricultural land situated in the vicinity of the Relapanawa Tank at

Sinharagama, containing coconut trees and other seasonal cultivations. The

Petitioner frequently visited the land in order to attend to and maintain the

cultivation.

The Petitioner stated that on 01.06.2020, at around 12 noon, while

travelling to his cultivation on his motorcycle bearing Registration No. NC

BCT-0279, the Petitioner was stopped by a police party led by the 1st

Respondent. Without providing any reason, the Petitioner was arrested and

assaulted, and thereafter transported in the police jeep to the Anuradhapura

Police Station. Upon arrival, the Petitioner was taken into the police

quarters, tied, suspended, and assaulted with clubs, hands, and feet by

several officers, including the 1st Respondent. During this assault, he heard

the 1st Respondent refer to three other officers by the names Rathnayake,

Asela, and Bandara, whom the Petitioner has identified as the 2nd to 4th

Respondents. The Petitioner was questioned as to whether he had any

​​6

involvement in cannabis-related transactions, which he categorically denied.

Notwithstanding this, the assault continued, resulting in pain, injuries, and

impairment of hearing.

The Petitioner stated that he was thereafter compelled to sign a statement

prepared by the police, which was neither made by him nor read over to

him. He was detained overnight at the Anuradhapura Police Station and

thereafter transferred to the Nochchiyagama Police Station. On 02.06.2020,

he was produced before the Magistrate’s Court of Thambuththegama on the

allegation that he was in possession of 1336 grams of cannabis. A full

certified copy of the proceedings in the Magistrate’s Court has been marked

P3. The B Report dated 02.06.2020 filed by the 5th Respondent is at page 1

of the said document and has been marked P3a. The record of proceedings

dated 02.06.2020, including the Learned Magistrate’s Order remanding the

Petitioner and directing that he be produced before the Judicial Medical

Officer, is contained at pages 17 to 20 of P3 and has been marked P3b.

The Petitioner was thereafter admitted to the Anuradhapura Teaching

Hospital on 04.06.2020, and the Bed Head Ticket issued to him has been

marked P4. On the same date, the Petitioner was examined by the Judicial

Medical Officer, Dr. H. A. Karunathilake, who recorded multiple injuries

including a traumatic perforation of the left ear, extensive contusions to the

back and both thighs, and tramline contusions to the upper arm and wrist.

The Medico-Legal Report submitted to Court is contained at page 22 of P3

has been marked P3c / P3e.

During the period of his hospitalization, the Petitioner stated that he was

examined by the Departments of Audio-Vestibular and ENT and Audiology to

assess the degree of hearing impairment sustained as a result of the

assault. The said reports confirm a severe hearing loss on the left side and

has been marked P5a and P5b.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Petitioner was not physically produced in

Court for several months, and his period of remand continued to be

extended. During this time, no family members were permitted to visit him.

​​7

On 04.06.2020, the Petitioner’s daughter attended at the Human Rights

Commission Office, Anuradhapura, seeking to lodge a complaint regarding

his arrest and assault. However, her complaint was refused on the basis

that the Petitioner must be personally present. Her affidavit recounting

these events has been marked P6.

On 02.09.2020, the Petitioner stated that was granted bail by the

Magistrate’s Court. After his release, he personally sought to lodge a

complaint before the Human Rights Commission, but was informed that as

proceedings were pending before the Court, such a complaint could not be

accepted.

The Petitioner stated that due to the assault by the 1st to 4th Respondents,

he has suffered partial hearing impairment and continues to experience

pain and disability. During his incarceration of approximately three months,

he was prevented from engaging in his business activities, resulting in

financial loss. He was also unable to cultivate seven acres of paddy land

belonging to him at Wilachchiya, further worsening his financial hardship.

The Petitioner asserted that his arrest and detention were unlawful, without

reasonable cause, and not in compliance with due process. The Petitioner

stated that the Respondents violated his fundamental rights guaranteed

under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1), 13(2), and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. The

Petitioner stated that grave loss and damage has been caused to him and

therefore is seeking compensation from this court.

The version of the Respondents

In their Statement of Objections, the 1st to 4th Respondents denied the

Petitioner’s assertions that he was unlawfully arrested, detained, or

subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. According to the

Respondents, on 01.06.2020 at approximately 08.10 hours, they departed

the Anuradhapura Police Station in a jeep bearing registration number

61-7148 and on their personal motorcycles to conduct investigations. The

certified copy of the Out Entry entered by the 1st Respondent in the Daily

​​8

Information Book has been marked R-1. On the same day, three arrests

were effected within the Anuradhapura and Nochchiyagama Police

Divisions, including that of the Petitioner at approximately 15.35 hours in

Sinharagama, based on intelligence information received from the Senapura

Army Camp that he was involved in transporting and trading cannabis. The

certified copy of the arrival entry made at 22.00 hours has been marked R-2.

The Respondents averred that upon receiving intelligence that the Petitioner

was delivering approximately one kilogram of cannabis, they positioned

themselves in the vicinity of Oyamaduwa Road. Upon seeing the Petitioner

arriving on a motorcycle bearing registration number NCBCT 0279 while

carrying a black tulip bag, they attempted to apprehend him. The Petitioner

allegedly attempted to flee, resulting in a pursuit and physical struggle

lasting approximately four to five minutes. After subduing the Petitioner, the

Respondents inspected the black tulip bag in his possession, which

contained cannabis, whereupon he was arrested and taken to the

Nochchiyagama Police Station. Certified copies of the relevant investigation

entries and property receipts have been marked R-3 and R-4(a), R-4(b), and

R-4(c), respectively.

The Respondents asserted that upon handing over the Petitioner to the 5th

Respondent, the Reserve Police Officer recorded that no visible injuries were

present, as evidenced by entry marked R-5. They contend that the

Medico-Legal Report marked P3(c), which classifies the injuries as

non-grievous, corroborates their position that any injuries sustained were a

result of the Petitioner’s resistance during arrest rather than any deliberate

assault. The Respondents further noted that the medical documents

tendered by the Petitioner, marked P3, P3(a), P3(b), P3(e), and P4, together

with reports P5(a), P5(b), and P6, do not substantiate the claim that the 1st

to 4th Respondents inflicted unlawful harm.

The Respondents emphasised that, in the discharge of their official duties,

they maintained accurate and contemporaneous records in the Daily

Information Book and property registers, and that under Section 114(d) of

​​9

the Evidence Ordinance, the Court may presume that official acts have been

regularly performed. Accordingly, the Respondents have submitted that the

records produced, including entries R-1 to R-5, must be accorded due

evidentiary weight.

The Respondents further stated that the Petitioner is a habitual offender

engaged in the illicit trafficking of cannabis, and that certified reports

marked R-6 and R-7 demonstrate prior convictions in the Puttalam

Magistrate’s Court for possession of cannabis. They contend that these prior

convictions cast serious doubt on the credibility of the Petitioner,

particularly in light of his assertion in document P3(c) that he had never

consumed alcohol or cigarettes in his life. However, the existence of such

prior convictions does not in any way justify any form of mistreatment, as

every person is equal before the law and entitled to the protection of Article

12(1) of the Constitution.

The Respondents denied that the Petitioner was arrested for any collateral or

mala fide purpose, asserting that he was apprehended lawfully upon

reasonable suspicion, informed of the offence, and produced before the

Magistrate without delay.

With respect to the role of the 5th Respondent, the 1st to 4th Respondents

submitted that the custody of the Petitioner was duly handed over to the 5th

Respondent without any visible injuries, and therefore the burden shifts to

the 5th Respondent to explain any subsequent injuries observed. The only

allegation levelled against the 5th Respondent by the Petitioner is that he

produced the Petitioner before the Thambuthegama Magistrate’s Court on a

false allegation that he possessed 1136 grams of cannabis. Therefore,

considering the documentary record, the timeline of events, and the

inconsistencies in the Petitioner’s own account, the Respondents submitted

that the Petitioner has failed to establish a violation under Article 11 of the

Constitution.

In the written submissions of the 7th Respondent, the Learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) appearing for the 7th respondent

​​10

submitted that, the Hon. Attorney General, by letter dated 12.07.2021,

informed the 1st to 4th Respondents that in view of the Medico-Legal Report

marked P3C, filed by the Petitioner, the Attorney General would not

undertake their representation. A copy of this communication has been

marked 7R1.

When the application was supported for leave to proceed on 14.03.2023, the

learned SDSG appeared on behalf of the Attorney General (7th Respondent)

alone. Upon hearing submissions, the Court granted leave to proceed under

Articles 11 and 12(1) against the 1st to 4th Respondents, and under Article

12(1) against the 5th Respondent. The Learned SDSG submitted that

consequent to this order, the Attorney General, by letter dated 19.04.2023,

informed the 5th Respondent that the Attorney General would not

undertake his defence. A copy of this communication is marked 7R2. The

5th Respondent thereafter requested reconsideration, but the decision had

remained unchanged.

When this application was taken up for argument on 07.07.2025, the

learned SDSG stated that she took steps to inform the Director Legal of the

Police Department in order to alert the 5th Respondent, who was

unrepresented at the time. However, the 5th Respondent remained absent

and unrepresented. The Learned SDSG stated that thereafter, by letter

dated 20.08.2025, the Director Legal informed the Attorney General that the

5th Respondent was presently attached to the SSP’s Office, Anuradhapura,

and that he had previously been informed of the Attorney General's

decision.

On behalf of the 7th Respondent, it was submitted that the application is

time-barred, as the alleged acts of torture are said to have occurred on

01.06.2020, whereas the Petition was filed on 28.09.2020. The Petitioner

contends that delay was caused due to the Human Rights Commission

declining to accept a complaint tendered by his daughter. However, the only

material before Court on this point is the affidavit of the Petitioner’s

daughter, and no documentary material from the Commission itself has

​​11

been produced. Accordingly, the SDSG submitted that the Petitioner has not

established the alleged refusal by the Human Rights Commission to

entertain the application of the Petitioner.

The Learned SDSG for the 7th Respondent contended that throughout the

Petition the Petitioner attributes the assault exclusively to the 1st to 4th

Respondents at the Anuradhapura Police Station. The Petitioner does not

allege that the 5th Respondent assaulted him at the Nochchiyagama Police

Station. The only allegation directed at the 5th Respondent is that he

produced the Petitioner before the Magistrate on a false charge. During

argument, the Petitioner pointed to an inconsistency between two

B-Reports, one referring to possession of 1g 136mg of heroin, and the earlier

report stating 1kg 136g of cannabis. The Respondent had submitted that

this discrepancy is a typographical error, particularly since the subsequent

reports, the Government Analyst reference, and the affidavit tendered by the

1st Respondent in the Thabuththegama MC case record (pages 26–27 of P3)

consistently refer to 1kg 136g of cannabis, and the Petitioner raised no

objection before the Magistrate, although he was legally represented. The

Learned SDSG submitted that the Petitioner himself, in paragraph 12 of his

Petition, refers to the production as cannabis. The Respondents contention

that therefore the Petitioner was neither misled nor prejudiced by the

clerical error.

It was further submitted on behalf of the Attorney General that the State

has neither authorised nor condoned the alleged conduct of the 1st to 5th

Respondents. Reliance is placed on Thadchanamoorthi and Others v

Attorney General (1978-79-80) 1 SLR 154, where it was recognised that

there may arise circumstances in which an act committed by an officer,

though carried out while holding office, must be regarded as a purely

personal act not attracting State liability. Attention is also drawn to Sri

Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and others v Kurukulasuriya and

Jayasekara, SCFR 556 and 557/2008; 2021 (2) SLR 1, where this Court

observed that the awarding of compensation must depend on the particular

​​12

circumstances of the case, bearing in mind that public funds represent

taxpayer money and must not be dispensed without careful justification.

In these circumstances, the Learned SDSG for the 7th Respondent

contended that the Petitioner has not established entitlement to the relief

sought, and that the facts and evidence do not warrant the imposition of

liability on the 6th and 7th Respondents in this application.

The alleged violation of Article 11 by the 1st to 4th Respondents

Article 11 of the Constitution mandates that, “No person shall be subjected

to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment.” As

reiterated in Wasana Niroshini Wickrama v. Nalaka and Others SC FR

349/2014 decided on 16th October 2023, the protection afforded by

Article 11 is absolute, allowing no exception or derogation under any

circumstance. The acts committed against the Petitioner strike at the core of

human dignity, a foundational constitutional value recognised in Dr. Ajith

Perera v. Daya Gamage and Others SCFR 273/2018 decided on 18th

April 2019, where this Court affirmed that dignity is the wellspring from

which all fundamental rights derive their meaning and effect.

In W.B. Inoka Nadishani and Another v K.D. Somapala and Others SC

FR 155/2009, decided on 04th April 2025, Justice Thurairaja PC

undertook a detailed and thoughtful exposition on the centrality of human

dignity within our constitutional framework, drawing on long-standing

ethical and philosophical traditions of this country. His Lordship observed

that the Dasavidha-rājadhamma in Buddhism lays down the ten virtues

expected of those who exercise authority, including Sīla (morality), Maddava

(kindness), Akkodha (freedom from hatred) and Avihimsa (non-violence),

which require those in positions of power to act with restraint, compassion

and respect for the intrinsic dignity of each individual. His Lordship further

referred to the Aththupanayaka Dhamma Pariyaya, beautifully expressed in

the Dhammapada, as reflecting this fundamental moral imperative:

​​13

“Sabbe tasanti daṇḍassa/ සබ්බෙ තසන්ති දණ්ඩස්ස,​

sabbesaṁ jīvitaṁ piyaṁ/ සබ්බෙසං ජීවිතං පියං,​

attānaṁ upamaṁ katvā/ අත්තානං උපමං කත්වා,​

na haneyya na ghātaye/ න හනෙය්ය න ඝාතයෙ.

[all fear the stick/punishment​

all hold their lives dear​

putting oneself in another's place​

one must not commit violence nor kill]”

His Lordship Justice Thurairaja PC further observed that Hindu philosophy,

as reflected in the concept of Rajadharma and the model of governance

embodied in Rama Rajya in the Ramayana, similarly posits that rulers must

embody Nyaya (justice), Karuna (compassion), Satya (truthfulness) and

Kshama (forbearance), placing the welfare and dignity of the people at the

centre of all governance. His Lordship emphasised that both Buddhist and

Hindu traditions converge on a common ethic: that authority may only be

exercised in a manner that affirms, protects, and advances the inherent

dignity of human beings.

This philosophical and cultural heritage, as articulated by Justice

Thurairaja PC, reinforces the absolute nature of the protection guaranteed

under Article 11 of the Constitution. The inviolability of the human person is

not only a constitutional command but is also deeply rooted in the moral

consciousness and civilisational values of this nation.

The medical report tendered by the Petitioner and marked P3C records a

series of injuries of significant severity and extent, inconsistent with

incidental force or a brief scuffle, and instead indicative of deliberate and

repeated infliction of pain. The report identifies a 10% traumatic perforation

of the left ear, demonstrating an impact of appreciable force to the head

region. In addition, the examiner records a contused and oedematous area

measuring 50 x 42 cm across the back of the body, extending down to the

posterior aspect of both thighs. The sheer area affected, encompassing the

​​14

back and both upper legs, is strongly suggestive of systematic and repeated

beating while the Petitioner was in a vulnerable position.

The report further notes a tramline contusion measuring 11 x 7 cm on the

posterior aspect of the left upper arm, an injury typically associated with

blows administered by a flexible rod-like instrument. There is also an

abrasion placed over the lateral aspect of the right wrist joint, which aligns

with friction or restraint consistent with the Petitioner having been

restrained or held down.

Moreover, P3C documents two distinct clusters of tramline contusions on

both thighs: five tramline contusions on the right thigh, measuring 14 x 3

cm, 10 x 3 cm, 14 x 3 cm, 7 x 3 cm and 8 x 3 cm, and a further five tramline

contusions on the left thigh, measuring 20 x 4 cm, 21 x 4 cm, 14 x 4 cm, 11

x 4 cm and 15 x 4 cm. Tramline contusions of this nature are regarded in

forensic medicine as classic markers of corporal punishment inflicted with a

rod, pole, baton or similar implement. They are not the result of accidental

contact or incidental force in the course of arrest. The repeated patterning,

near-symmetrical placement, and varying but significant lengths of these

contusions reinforce that the force was applied intentionally, at multiple

points, and with severity.

In the face of this medical evidence, the explanation offered by the

Respondents, that the injuries resulted from a scuffle during arrest and that

the Petitioner bore no visible injuries when he was handed over to the 5th

Respondent, cannot be accepted. The nature, pattern and distribution of the

injuries recorded in P3C directly contradict the Respondents’ narrative.

Where a person has suffered injuries during a period of detention, the

custodial officers bear a corresponding obligation to offer a clear and

credible explanation for the manner in which those injuries were caused.

Here, no plausible justification has been provided. The inference that the

injuries were inflicted while the Petitioner was under the custody and

control of State officers is therefore both reasonable and compelling.

​​15

The injuries described in P3C are not merely physical impressions; they are

manifestations of a deliberate assault on the dignity of the human person.

They demonstrate subjugation, humiliation, and the infliction of suffering

for purposes incompatible with lawful authority. Such treatment plainly

constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of

Article 11.

This conclusion is reinforced by Sri Lanka’s obligations under Article 14.1 of

the Convention Against Torture, which mandates that a victim of torture

is entitled to redress, including compensation and rehabilitation. The

alignment of constitutional protection with international obligation here is

direct and unequivocal.

Accordingly, based on the objective medical evidence contained in P3C, the

absence of any credible or lawful explanation from the Respondents, and the

constitutional and international standards governing the treatment of

persons in custody, this Court finds that the Petitioner’s fundamental right

under Article 11 of the Constitution has been violated. The dignity of the

individual was not preserved; it was actively denied. This Court is therefore

duty-bound to grant appropriate relief to vindicate that right in full

measure.

Alleged violation of Article 12(1) by the 1st to 4th Respondents

The Petitioner’s claim under Article 12(1) of the Constitution warrants close

judicial scrutiny within the framework of the statutory provisions and the

factual record disclosed before this Court. Article 12(1) of the Constitution

declares that “All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the

equal protection of the law.” This provision is not an abstract declaration of

equality; it is a substantive guarantee that binds all agents exercising public

authority to act lawfully, reasonably, and without arbitrariness,

discrimination, or mala fides. The constitutional promise of equality before

the law demands that all persons similarly circumstanced be treated alike,

and that no person be subjected to differential or hostile treatment except

upon a reasonable and lawful basis.

​​16

Section 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (as

amended), reinforces this principle by delineating the permissible limits of

physical conduct in the course of effecting an arrest. The law permits only

such measures as are “reasonably necessary to effect the arrest” in

instances of resistance. It thereby safeguards individuals from arbitrary use

of force, fabricated charges, and any form of ill-treatment under the guise of

law enforcement. These statutory provisions reflect the broader

constitutional ethos that every arrest and detention must be effected with

respect for the inherent dignity and equal protection owed to every person.

In Elmore Perera v Major Montague Jayawickrama, Minister of Public

and Plantation Industries and Others (1985) 1 Sri LR 285,

Sharvananda CJ articulated the essence of Article 12 in terms that remain

authoritative. His Lordship observed that “Since the essence of the right

guaranteed by Article 12 and the evils which it seeks to guard against are the

avoidance of designed and intentional hostile treatment or discrimination on

the part of those entrusted with the administering of the same, a person

setting up grievances of denial of equal treatment must establish that between

persons similarly circumstanced, some were treated to their prejudice and the

differential treatment had no reasonable relevance to the object sought to be

achieved.” Thus, the touchstone for a violation under Article 12(1) is not

merely difference in treatment, but unjustified and arbitrary differentiation

that departs from the rule of law.

Applying these principles to the present case, the material before the Court,

particularly the medico-legal report marked P3C, the contemporaneous

court record at P3(b), and related documents, discloses significant

irregularities in the process by which the Petitioner was deprived of his

liberty. The Petitioner’s account of events is corroborated by P3C, which

records extensive and severe injuries wholly inconsistent with a mere

resisted arrest. The report details, inter alia, a 10% traumatic perforation of

the left ear; a large contused and oedematous area extending across the

back and thighs; tramline contusions on both arms and thighs; and

abrasions on the wrist. These injuries, further supported by hospital

​​17

admission notes (P4) and subsequent audiological findings (P5a and P5b),

clearly bear the marks of deliberate infliction rather than incidental contact.

The Respondents, in their Statement of Objections, seek to shift the burden

of explanation, contending that the Petitioner was uninjured when custody

was transferred to the 5th Respondent and that any injuries must have been

sustained thereafter. Reliance is placed on official entries, including R5,

purporting to record the absence of visible injuries at the time of handover.

Yet such entries stand in stark and irreconcilable contrast with the

comprehensive medical evidence. It is well established that where a person

sustains injuries while in the custody of public officers, those officers bear a

heightened duty to account for such harm. The Respondents have failed to

discharge that burden. Their silence and the implausibility of their

explanations only reinforce the inference of unlawful and unequal

treatment.

Further, the Respondents have sought to tender documents marked R6 and

R7, which refer to previous convictions of the Petitioner for possession of

cannabis before the Puttalam Magistrate’s Court. They contend that these

convictions undermine the credibility of the Petitioner’s statement in P3C,

wherein he claimed never to have consumed alcohol or cigarettes. This

argument is wholly misplaced. Even assuming a contradiction exists as to

the Petitioner’s personal habits, such inconsistency is immaterial to the

central question before this Court, namely, whether he was subjected to

unlawful arrest, fabrication of charges, and cruel treatment while in

custody. The existence of prior convictions, however relevant to sentencing

or character assessment in criminal proceedings, cannot in law justify the

violation of constitutional rights.

Indeed, as a matter of constitutional doctrine, equality before the law does

not depend on an individual’s moral worth, prior record, or social standing.

The right to equal protection inheres in every person, including those with

criminal antecedents. To permit otherwise would erode the foundation of the

rule of law and confer upon state actors the power to determine whose

​​18

rights deserve protection. The Respondents’ reliance on R6 and R7 is,

therefore, not only irrelevant but constitutionally untenable.

This Court finds instructive the reasoning of Sisira de Abrew, J. in

Rajapaksha v Rathnayake and Others [2016] 1 Sri LR 119 at 130,

where His Lordship observed:

“When the 1st Respondent arrested the petitioner without any reasons and

fabricated a false charge against him, can it be said that he got equal

protection of law and that the 1st Respondent applied the principle that ‘all

persons are equal before the law’ to the petitioner? This question has to be

answered and is answered in the negative.”

In the present case, the inconsistencies in the B Reports filed by the 5th

Respondent, most notably the contradiction between the references to

heroin and cannabis, raise serious doubts about the legitimacy of the

proceedings initiated against the Petitioner. These contradictions, coupled

with the absence of credible explanation for the documented injuries and

the reliance on irrelevant past convictions, expose an arbitrary and mala

fide exercise of authority inconsistent with the obligations imposed by

Article 12(1).

Having regard to the statutory standard under Section 23 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act and the totality of the evidence, this Court is

satisfied that:

(i) the Petitioner’s arrest was unjustified and unlawful;

(ii) the B Reports are tainted by inconsistency and fabrication;

(iii) the Respondents have failed to provide a reasonable or lawful

explanation for the Petitioner’s injuries; and

(iv) reliance on the Petitioner’s prior convictions constitutes an

impermissible attempt to rationalise misconduct.

​​19

These cumulative circumstances demonstrate not only a denial of equal

protection but also a deliberate disregard for the constitutional obligation to

treat all persons alike under the law. Accordingly, I find that the Petitioner’s

fundamental right guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution has

been violated.

Alleged violation of Article 12(1) by the 5th Respondent

In their Statement of Objections, the 1st to 4th Respondents contended that

the Petitioner was handed over to the custody of the 5th Respondent, who at

the relevant time was functioning as the Officer-in-Charge of the

Nochchiyagama Police Station. They asserted that the responsibility to

explain the injuries sustained by the Petitioner accordingly shifts to the 5th

Respondent, particularly since one of the subordinates under the command

of the 5th Respondent had entered in the Official Information Book that the

Petitioner bore no visible injuries at the time of the handover. The only direct

allegation leveled against the 5th Respondent by the Petitioner is that he

thereafter produced the Petitioner before the Thambuthegama Magistrate’s

Court on the basis of a false charge alleging possession of 1136 grams of

cannabis.

However, during oral submissions, attention was drawn to significant

discrepancies in the B Reports submitted by the 5th Respondent,

specifically where the Petitioner was described as having been in possession

of heroin rather than cannabis. These are not minor inconsistencies. The

nature of the controlled substance forms the very core of the charge and the

legality of the arrest. A contradiction of this nature casts substantial doubt

on the accuracy of the investigative material placed before the Magistrate

and undermines the integrity of the prosecution narrative. Such

discrepancies engage the constitutional protection guaranteed under Article

12(1), as they suggest the possibility of arbitrary and capricious conduct

rather than uniform and equal application of the law. When the record itself

indicates uncertainty or carelessness in the formulation of the primary

​​20

accusation, the resulting deprivation of liberty cannot be said to have arisen

through due process.

The B-report(s) and the magistrate’s file (P3, P3a, P3b and related entries)

reveal an unexplained discrepancy: on the one hand the original production

alleged possession of 1 kg 136 g of ganja; on the other, a subsequent

B-report records the same quantity as “heroin”, a manifestly improbable

transposition for which no satisfactory explanation has been tendered in the

Magistrate’s Court or to this Court. That typographical anomaly, left

uncorrected despite the petitioner being legally represented in the

Magistrate’s Court, not only raises questions of sloppiness but also of

reliability and transparency in the prosecutorial record.

The fact that the 1st Respondent in a sworn affidavit in the magistrate’s

proceedings confirms the discovery of 1 kg 136 g of cannabis (see pages

26–27 of P3) only highlights that the discrepancy was a recording error, one

that ought to have been noticed, corrected and explained at the earliest

stage. The failure to do so prejudiced the petitioner and diminishes

confidence that the arrest and charging process was exercised with due

regard to legal safeguards.

In the Written Submissions tendered on behalf of the 7th Respondent, it is

stated that the 7th Respondent elected not to represent the 5th Respondent

and had communicated this decision to him. Throughout the course of these

proceedings, the 5th Respondent has remained absent and unrepresented.

No explanation has been provided by the 5th Respondent to clarify the

discrepancies in the B Reports nor to account for the injuries alleged. The

7th Respondent submits that the reference to heroin instead of cannabis

was merely a typographical error which occasioned no prejudice to the

Petitioner, particularly since no objection had been raised before the

Magistrate at the time, while the Petitioner was represented by counsel.

This Court cannot accept such a submission lightly. The responsibility to

ensure accuracy in the preparation and filing of B Reports lies squarely with

the officer producing the suspect before Court. The B Report is the

​​21

foundational document upon which judicial oversight is triggered, and it

directly informs the liberty of the individual. A discrepancy as to the

substance alleged to have been found is not clerical but substantive. The

failure of the 5th Respondent to appear before this Court and offer any

explanation for either the injuries or the inconsistent material strengthens

the inference that there has been a failure to discharge the duty of candour

and accountability expected of an officer acting under colour of law.

Accordingly, the contradiction in the B Reports, coupled with the

unexplained injuries and the absence of the 5th Respondent, support the

conclusion that the Petitioner was not afforded the equal protection of the

law guaranteed to him under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Liability of the State

The 7th Respondent, has consistently maintained throughout the pendency

of this Application that the Attorney General's Department will not

undertake the defence of the 1st to 5th Respondents. This position, as

correctly noted, signifies the disapproval of the alleged conduct of the said

Respondents and the unwillingness of the State’s principal legal office to

endorse or justify such acts. The Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General

(SDSG) appearing for the 7th Respondent submitted that not every police

officer who arrests and detains a suspect resorts to violence and that the

decision to assault a suspect is one taken in a private capacity. It was thus

contended that not every wrongful act of an errant police officer

automatically attracts State liability. In support of this contention, reliance

was placed on Thadchanamoorthi and Others v Attorney General [1978]

1 SLR 154 and Velmurugu v Attorney General and Others [1981] 1 SLR

406.

However, the principle articulated in Amal Sudath Silva v Kodituwakku,

Inspector of Police and Others [1987] 2 Sri LR 119 at 126, is of decisive

importance in this context. There, the Court held that “The police force,

being an organ of the State, is enjoined by the Constitution to secure and

advance this right and not to deny, abridge or restrict the same in any manner

​​22

and under any circumstances.” This pronouncement firmly establishes that

acts of torture, assault, or unlawful detention by police officers cannot be

treated as private ventures detached from the State, for such actions are

possible only through the authority and power vested in them by law.

This principle has been further reinforced in Rannula Sugath Mohana

Mendis v D.K.A. Sanath Kumara and Others [SC FR 100/2022, decided

on 06.10.2023], where Justice Thurairaja, PC, observed that, “If this Court

were to criticise the actions of the Police Force, it need not look further than

the police motto itself; ‘ධම්මෝ හවේ රක්කති ධම්මචාරි’ which states ‘those who

live by the Dhamma are protected by the Dhamma’. One would expect that the

Police force of Sri Lanka would follow this motto when carrying out their

duties, without mala fide. However, we observe, they have failed to stick to

the basics of their code of conduct and the principles of natural justice.” This

observation captures the moral and constitutional responsibility of the

Police to act as protectors of the people and as custodians of the rule of law,

not as violators of it.

The liability of the State arises from this fundamental constitutional duty to

protect and uphold the rights of its citizens. Every organ of the State,

including the Police, is bound by this duty. When police officers, acting

under the colour of their official authority, infringe upon the fundamental

rights of individuals, the responsibility does not dissipate merely because

such acts are unlawful. Rather, the State is held accountable for those

violations, as it is the very power and authority conferred by law that

enables such transgressions. This is not only a question of legal liability but

of constitutional morality and the preservation of public confidence in the

justice system.

The Police form the bedrock of law enforcement and public security. They

are entrusted with immense powers to maintain peace and order. With that

power comes an equally compelling duty, to ensure that those under their

custody are treated with dignity, fairness, and respect. When those

entrusted with protecting the public instead become its tormentors, the

​​23

fabric of public trust unravels. The law cannot and must not tolerate such a

situation.

Upon a careful examination of all material before this Court, it is evident

that the versions of the 1st to 5th Respondents are inconsistent and

self-contradictory. The evidence, particularly the medical reports marked

P3C and the discrepancies in the B Reports filed by the 5th Respondent,

reveal grave irregularities. The contradictions concerning the nature of the

narcotics allegedly found in the Petitioner’s possession, as between cannabis

and heroin, cast serious doubt on the credibility of the Respondents’ version

and demonstrate arbitrary and unequal treatment before the law,

amounting to a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

In light of the material facts and legal principles discussed above, I find that

the 1st to 4th Respondents and the State have violated the Petitioner’s

fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 11 and 12(1) of the

Constitution by subjecting him to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment

and by acting in a manner that denies him equal protection of the law. I

further hold that the 5th Respondent has violated Article 12(1) through

arbitrary and mala fide conduct in the filing of inconsistent B Reports and

the institution of a fabricated charge.

While the Learned SDSG, relying on Kurukusoorya and Jayasekara v Sri

Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and Others [SC FR 556/2008 and

557/2008, 2021 (2) SLR], has cautioned against indiscriminate orders of

compensation, noting that the State’s funds are drawn from public revenue,

this Court observes that the source of funds cannot absolve the State of

responsibility for violations committed under its authority. To accept such

an argument would be to render constitutional guarantees hollow. The

police are meant to be the shield of the people, not the sword that wounds

them.

Accordingly, while I refrain from awarding monetary compensation in this

instance, I direct the 6th Respondent (the present Inspector General of

Police) to initiate immediate disciplinary proceedings against the 1st to 5th

​​24

Respondents to ensure accountability and to prevent the recurrence of such

acts in the future. The preservation of justice demands no less.

Further I order the 1st to 5th Respondents to pay compensation to the

Petitioner in the following manner:

1.​ The 1st Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs.

200,000/- (Rupees Two Hundred Thousand );

2.​ The 2nd Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs.

200,000/- (Rupees Two Hundred Thousand);

3.​ The 3rd Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs.

200,000/- (Rupees Two Hundred Thousand).

4.​ The 4th Respondent is ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs.

200,000/- (Rupees Two Hundred Thousand).

5.​ The 5th Respondent ordered to pay as compensation a sum of Rs.

100,000/- (Rupees One Hundred Thousand).

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents are to pay the aforementioned

sums, within six months from the date of judgement, out of their personal

funds.

Application Allowed.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT S. Thurairaja PC, J. I agree.
