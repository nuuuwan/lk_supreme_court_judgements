"petition, which reads thus,"
"1.  Did  the  learned  Judges  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  err  in  law  by"
"overlooking the vital aspect that the plaintiffs have failed to establish"
"the identity of the corpus, which is a vital element to succeed in a"
"Rei Vindicatio action."
"2.  Whether the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court have failed"
"to appreciate the vital fact that the plaintiffs have not successfully"
"established their title to the land in suit as pleaded in the plaint, as"
"the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs at the trial is not in conformity"
"with the pleadings."
"3.  Whether  the  learned  Judges  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  have"
"arrived  at  an  erroneous  conclusion  that  the  plaintiffs  have  duly"
"proved the identity of the corpus solely based on the plan and the"
"survey reports marked as ‘P-11’and ‘P-12’, as those documents are"
"not sufficient evidence to prove the identity of the land in suit."
