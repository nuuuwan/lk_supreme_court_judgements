Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the 1st and 2nd defendant-respondent-

appellants on the basis of being aggrieved by the judgment pronounced on

11-07-2018 by the Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in

Gampaha, while exercising the civil appellate jurisdiction granted in terms of

Article 154P of The Constitution.

From the impugned judgment, the judgment pronounced by the learned

Additional District Judge of Gampaha in District Court of Gampaha Case No-

38975/L was set aside, and a judgment entered in favour of the 1st and 2nd

Page 8 of 21

plaintiffs in the said action, giving reliefs as sought for in the prayer of the

plaint.

When this matter was supported for leave to appeal, this Court granted leave

on the questions of law as stated in paragraph 12 (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the

petition, which reads thus,

1. Did the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court err in law by

overlooking the vital aspect that the plaintiffs have failed to establish

the identity of the corpus, which is a vital element to succeed in a

Rei Vindicatio action.

2. Whether the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court have failed

to appreciate the vital fact that the plaintiffs have not successfully

established their title to the land in suit as pleaded in the plaint, as

the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs at the trial is not in conformity

with the pleadings.

3. Whether the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court have

arrived at an erroneous conclusion that the plaintiffs have duly

proved the identity of the corpus solely based on the plan and the

survey reports marked as P-11and P-12, as those documents are

not sufficient evidence to prove the identity of the land in suit.

This Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd

defendant-respondent-appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

appellants) as well as the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the

1a and 2nd plaintiff-appellant-respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the respondents) in relation to their respective stands. This Court also had

the benefit of reading written submissions tendered by both parties in relation

to the appeal before the Court.

This is a matter where the original 1st and 2nd plaintiffs, being the father and

the daughter, filed an action before the District Court of Gampaha seeking a

declaration of title to the land morefully described in the schedule of the

plaint, and also for an order to evict the original 1st to 4th defendants

mentioned in the plaint on the basis that they have encroached on to a part

Page 9 of 21

of the land belonging to them, and unlawfully occupying the said portion of

land.

In their plaint, the respondents have set out their title stating that the land

mentioned in the schedule of the plaint is a land called Godawalewatta, now

known as Helaudakalla, three roods in extent. It has been stated that it was

originally owned by Kumburugodage Kechcha Nona, the mother of the 1st

plaintiff, who became entitled to the said property by possessing it for a period

of over 10 years without any interruption, and thereby, acquiring prescriptive

title to it. It has been claimed that upon her death, the 1st plaintiff, namely

Alleen Singho, inherited the property being the only child of her.

The 1st plaintiff has thereafter gifted an undivided 2/3rd of the property to his

daughter, who is the 2nd plaintiff in the action, by way of a deed as stated in

paragraph 4 of the plaint.

It has been claimed that the original defendants in the District Court action

have forcibly encroached a part of the land belonging to the plaintiffs on 03-

07-1994, claiming that the said portion of land is a part of a land called

Meegahawatta which is owned by them.

It is on that basis, the respondents, being the plaintiffs of the action, have

instituted this action before the District Court in the form of a Rei Vindicatio

suit, seeking relief as stated in the prayer of the plaint.

The position of the appellants, being the defendants before the District Court,

had been that the land claimed by the plaintiffs is a portion of a larger land

called Meegahawatta, about 8 acres in extent. Setting out title to the said land

called Meegahawatta, and claiming that they are in possession of the disputed

portion of land on the basis of their pleaded title, the appellants have sought

a dismissal of the action by the respondents, and for other reliefs as stated in

their answer.

It is apparent from the District Court record that the respondents have

obtained two commissions to depict the disputed land, which are the plans

and reports marked as P-11 and P-12 respectively, at the trial. It appears that

since the surveyor who surveyed the land and prepared the plan marked P-

Page 10 of 21

11 was deceased at the time the case went on to trial, the plan and report

marked P-12 has been subsequently prepared by the Commissioner, who gave

evidence at the trial. The plan, which has been marked as V-01 during the

trial, has been prepared by the appellants to show the land they claim as a

part of a land called Meegahawatta, and also to show that the land claimed

by the respondents as Godawalewatta a.k.a Helaudakalla is in fact a part of

the land called Meegahawatta.

The matter has proceeded to trial ex parte against the 4th defendant mentioned

in the plaint as he has not responded to the summons issued on him. There

had been no admissions at the trial. The respondents have recorded 6 issues

to be decided based on their plaint, and the appellants have raised issue No.

07 to 10, pleading for the dismissal of the action.

It is noteworthy to mention that at the trial, the now deceased 1st plaintiff has

given evidence and had admitted that the original owner as claimed by him,

namely Kechcha Nona, who is his mother, had two other children as well,

which makes him only a co-owner of the land claimed by him as the sole

owner.

It is very much apparent from the judgment pronounced by the learned

Addition District Judge of Gampaha on 27-07-2011 that the learned

Additional District Judge has correctly considered whether the respondents

have identified the land described in their plaint as the land they claimed

ownership, or whether it was part of a much larger land. After having

considered the evidence placed before the Court, the learned Additional

District Judge has determined that the respondents have failed to establish

the identity of the land to the satisfaction of the Court, and also have failed to

establish the title to the portion of land mentioned in the schedule of the

plaint.

It is on that basis that the learned District Judge has proceeded to dismiss

the plaint answering the issues in favour of the defendants of the District

Court action.

Page 11 of 21

After hearing the appeal preferred by 1a and 2nd plaintiff-appellants before the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Gampaha exercising

its civil appellate jurisdiction, the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court,

pronouncing the appellate judgment on 11-07-2018, has proceeded to set

aside the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha on

the basis that the said plaintiff-appellants have actually proved the identity

of the land described in their plaint as a land called Godawalewatta a.k.a

Helaudakalla. It has been determined that it is a land situated outside of the

land claimed by the defendant-respondents as a part of a land called

Meegahawatta.

Accordingly, it has been determined that the plaintiff-appellants are the

owners of the said land, and that they are entitled to the reliefs sought by

them in their plaint, and thereby, a judgment was granted in favour of 1a and

2nd plaintiff-appellants before the High Court.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellants

strenuously argued that the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of

the Western Province Holden in Gampaha were wrong in determining that the

respondents have proved the identity of the corpus as well as the title, when

setting aside the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Gampaha. He cited several authorities as well as the relevant law in that

regard in support of his contention.

The submissions of the learned Counsel for the respondents were on the basis

that the respondents, being the plaintiffs of the action, have proved their case

on the balance of probability by establishing the identity of the corpus as well

as the title to it, which entitles them to obtain reliefs as sought for in their

plaint. It was her position that there exists no basis for this Court to interfere

with the judgment of the Provincial High Court of Western Province Holden in

Gampaha, pronounced exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction. Hence, she

moved for the dismissal of the appeal.

It is of paramount importance for a party who comes before a Court claiming

ownership or a right involved in a land, to establish the identity of such a land

Page 12 of 21

to the satisfaction of the Court so that the Court can pronounce a judgment

that can be enforceable relating to the claim before the Court. One of the

primary modes of doing so is for the party or parties to obtain the services of

a Court Commissioner to survey the disputed land and to identify the land as

well as the disputed portion if any.

In the case of Jamaldeen Abdul Latheef Vs. Abdul Majeed Mohamed

Mansoor and Another (2010) 2 SLR 333, it was held:

1. It is trite law that the identity of the property with respect to which a

vindicatory action is instituted is a fundamental to the success of the

action as the proof of the ownership (dominion) of the owner

(dominus). Where the property sought to be vindicated consists of a

land, the land sought to be vindicated must be identified by reference

to a survey plan or other equally expeditious method.

2. In a Rei Vindicatio action, it is not necessary to consider whether the

defendant has any title or right to possession, where the plaintiff has

failed to establish his title to the land sought to be vindicated, the

action ought to be dismissed without more.

Per Saleem Marsoof, J.,

An important feature of the actio rei vindicatio is that it has

to necessarily fail if the plaintiff cannot clearly establish his

title. Willes Principle of South African Laws (9th Edition-

2007) at pages 539-540 succinctly sets out the essentials of

the Rei Vindicatio action in the following manner: -

To succeed with the Rei Vindicatio, the owner must

prove on a balance of probabilities, first, his or her

ownership in the property. Secondly, the property

must exist, be clearly identifiable and must not have

been destroyed or consumed. Thirdly, the defendant

must be in possession or detention of the thing at the

moment the action is instituted. The rationale is to

Page 13 of 21

ensure that the defendant is in a position to comply

with an order for restoration.

When it comes to the case under appeal, it is clear that the respondents, being

the plaintiffs in the case, has produced the plans marked P-11 (plan No. 5976

dated 11-09-1996 by K.G. Hubert Perera Licenced Surveyor) and P-12 (plan

No. 1421 dated 10-08-2003 by R. Lakshman de Silva Licenced Surveyor) in

order to identify the land for which they claimed ownership, and also to show

the portion where allegedly the appellants, being the defendants in the case,

has encroached upon. The plan marked P-12, upon which the respondents

have relied upon, shows that their claim had been for lot No. 01, 02 and 03

of the said plan, which amounts to an extent of 1 rood and 26 perches. It had

been their position that lot No. 02 and 03 of the said plan were the portions

encroached upon by the appellants.

The appellants on the other hand, as the defendants of the District Court

action, has prepared and relied upon on the plan marked V-01 (plan No. 1416

dated 05-02-1997 by R.M.J Ranasinghe Licenced Surveyor) to set up their

claim to the disputed portion of land. Their position had been that they own

and possess the portions of lands shown as E, F, G, I, H. The disputed portion

of land has been shown as lots E and G, which is similar to lot No. 02 and 03

in the plan marked P-12.

It is very much apparent from the judgment of the learned Additional District

Judge of Gampaha that the learned Additional District Judge had been well

aware of the matters that need to be established before the Court, having

considered the competing claims to the portion of the land under dispute.

I find that the learned Additional District Judge has crystalized the above in

the following manner at page 04 of the judgment (page 232 of the appeal brief).

,

.

Page 14 of 21

With the above in mind, the learned Additional District Judge has proceeded

to consider whether the disputed portion of land has been identified, and

whether the respondents have established their title to the said land as

claimed by them in the pliant.

The evidence led before the District Court bears testimony that the action

before the District Court has occasioned as a result of a litigation which the

parties had before the Magistrate Court of Aththanagalla in terms of section

66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act over the possession of the same

disputed portion of land. In the said proceedings, the respondents have

claimed that the appellants erected a new fence separating their land, and

thereby, obtained forceful possession of it. However, the learned Magistrate of

Aththanagalla, who went on an inspection of the land, has observed that in

fact there is evidence of an old barbed wire fence which separated the lands

and it has been removed subsequently. This has resulted in the learned

Magistrate of Aththanagalla, in the capacity of the Primary Court Judge as

well, ordering that the disputed fence be re-erected, giving possession of the

disputed portion of land, namely lot No. 02 and 03 of the plan marked P-12,

which is also the lots E and G of the plan marked V-01, to the appellants.

The learned Additional District Judge has also duly considered the facts

relating to the dispute in order to determine whether the land claimed by the

respondents as the owners comprised of lots No. 01, 02 and 03 in the plan

marked P-12, and also whether it comprised of a distinct and separate land

called Godawalewatta a.k.a Helaudakalla, or else, it comprised of a part of a

much larger land called Meegahawatta.

The evidence of appellants had been to the effect that they are in possession

of a strip of land which runs from the Pradeshiya Sabha road towards the

South and up to the Northern boundary shown in all the plans with clearly

demarcated boundaries between the lot No. 01 and lot No. 02 and 03 in the

plan marked P-12.

As correctly determined by the learned Additional District Judge, if the

assertions of the respondents that lot No. 02 and 03 are part of lot No. 01 of

Page 15 of 21

the plan marked P-12, there should be a definitely identifiable boundary

towards the Southern boundary of the said three lots. The plan marked P-12

as well as the plan marked V-01 clearly shows that the Southern boundary of

all three lots were uncertain when the surveys were conducted. This goes on

to give more weight to the contention of the appellants that lot No. 02 and 03

of the plan marked P-12, or in other words, lots E and G of V-01, were held

and possessed by them as a part of lots I and H in the plan marked V-01, and

it is a part of a larger land called Meegahawatta.

Another fact that favours the position of the appellants is the extent of the

land claimed by the respondents to claim ownership and the actual extent of

the same land as shown in the survey plans relied on by them. It has been

claimed that the land prescribed by the plaintiffs predecessor in title was a

land of 03 roods in extent. However, the surveyor plan marked P-12 reveals

that the actual extent of the land is in fact 01 rood and 26 perches, which is

a land significantly less than the land for which the respondents claimed

ownership.

As observed correctly by the learned Additional District Judge, the now

deceased 1st plaintiff, while giving evidence before the trial Court, has stated

that the land called Meegahawatta claimed by the appellants is situated

towards the South of the land he claims as Godawalewatta a.k.a

Helaudakalla. He has also claimed that he is also a co-owner of the said land

and had admitted that his children are in possession of the said land based

on his co-ownership in the similar manner where the appellants occupy a

strip of land between the Pradeshiya Sabha road to the South and to the

Northern boundary as shown in plan P-12. The deceased 1st plaintiff in his

evidence before the trial Court has admitted that the land called

Meegahawatta for which he also claims co-ownership was a land of about 8

acres as claimed by the appellants and has stated that it extends beyond the

Pradeshiya Sabha road depicted in plan marked V-01. He has also stated as

correctly observed by the learned Additional District Judge that the said land

called Meegahawatta extends beyond the Northern boundary of the disputed

portion of land to which the respondents claim ownership as a separate land.

Page 16 of 21

I find that it is under these circumstances the learned Additional District

Judge, having analysed the evidence in relation to the identity of the land and

also the claimed ownership to it, has come to a finding that there cannot be a

separate portion of land called Godawalewatta a.k.a Helaudakalla in between

the larger land called Meegahawatta.

In the case of Luwis Singo and Others Vs. Ponnamperuma (1996) 2 SLR

320, it was held:

1. Actions for declaration of title and ejectment (as in this case) and

vindicatory actions are brought for the same purpose of recovery of

property. In Rei Vindicatio action the course of action is based on the sole

ground of the violation of the right of ownership and in such an action

proof is required that,

1. The plaintiff is the owner of the land in question i.e. he has the

dominium and,

2. That the land is in the possession of the defendant.

Even if an owner never had possession, it would not be a bar to a

vindicatory action.

Per Wingneswaran, J.,

The Court must dismiss the plaintiffs action for the following reasons: -

i. Plaintiff in a declaration of title and ejectment must prove his

title and his right to possess.

ii. The Defendant need not do so and if plaintiff fails in a balance

of probabilities the defendant would succeed.

iii. Under the Roman Dutch Principle Jus Tertii the plaintiff must

not only through a better title but also a title better than any

known to the defendant.

It is clear from the evidence placed before the District Court that although the

respondents have claimed sole ownership to the land they claimed as a

separate land based on a claimed prescriptive title of the mother of the 1st

plaintiff of the action, it had been an admitted fact that the said mother of the

Page 17 of 21

1st plaintiff, namely Kechcha Nona, also had two other children which makes

the 1st plaintiff in the action, if at all, a co-owner of the land.

It is well settled law that a co-owner of a land can institute an action to evict

a trespasser. It is also settled law that even if the plaintiffs claim of title was

on the basis of sole ownership, and if the Court finds that he is entitled to the

land as a co-owner only, there is no impediment to give a declaration of title

in favour of a plaintiff, limited to his proven co-ownership rights and to evict

a trespasser from the land based on his such rights.

Having considered a plethora of judgments and legal principles in that regard

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J. observed in the case of M. Sudath Harison

and others Vs. W. Piyaseeli Fernando and others SC Appeal No. 57/2016,

decided on 11-09-2023 that;

If the plaintiff in a Rei Vindicatio action seeks a declaration of title to the

entire land, but at the end of the trial, if the court finds that the plaintiff

is not entitled to the entire land but only to a portion of it the court need

not dismiss toto. It is a recognized principle that when a plaintiff has

asked for a greater relief than he is actually entitled to it should not

prevent him from getting the lesser relief which he is entitled to. Non

debet cui plus licet quod minus est non licere: the greater includes the

less. This is a well-established principle in law and also in consonance

with common sense.

In the case of Punchiappuhami Vs. Dingiribanda (SC/Appeal/4/2010, SC

Minutes of 20-11-2015) the plaintiff filed action seeking a declaration of title

to the whole land and ejectment of the defendant therefrom. The District

Court granted both reliefs. On appeal, the High Court reversed the judgment

of the District Court. Having considered the appeal preferred to the Supreme

Court challenging the High Court judgement Wanasundera, J. remarked:

I am of the view that the judges of the Civil Appellate High Court should

have granted a declaration of title only to 11/24th share of the co-owned

land of Belinchagahamula hena to the plaintiffs instead of dismissing the

action altogether. I hold that the appellants are only entitled to that relief

Page 18 of 21

and no more. Since it was not proved that the defendant was a

trespasser, he cannot be ejected by the plaintiffs.

In the case of Aththanayake Vs. Ramyawathie (2003) 1 SLR 401, the

original plaintiff sued the defendant for a declaration of title to the land in suit

and ejectment. The plaintiff did not refer to herself being a co-owner of the

land in dispute. The defendant too claimed title to the same land. The evidence

showed that the title to the allotment of land in suit was to be divided among

seven persons. The plaintiff failed to prove exclusive (prescriptive) title to the

larger land she claimed; nor was any issue suggested at the trial or in appeal

in respect of the larger land.

Held:

Although the plaintiff might have been entitled to a declaration of title to

a portion of the land as co-owner of the entire land, she failed to adduce

evidence of ownership for a portion or the larger land claimed by her by

prescription or ouster. In the circumstances of the case, the plaintiff was

not entitled for the relief of a declaration of title.

The above line of authorities clearly shows that the learned Additional District

Judge was correct in her determinations and answering the issues raised by

the parties, which led to the dismissal of the respondents action instituted

before the District Court.

It is manifestly clear that the respondents have not only failed to established

the identity of the land claimed by her as a separate land to the satisfaction

of the Court, and also the title claimed by them on such a basis either as a

co-owner or sole owners. The respondents have claimed title based on

prescription to it by their predecessor of title to the portion of land they have

claimed a separate land. However, the evidence made available before the

District Court clearly provides, as I have considered before, that the

appellants contention that the said portion of land is also part of a larger land

has more meaning, for which the appellants as well as the respondents are

admittedly co-owners.

Page 19 of 21

However, it appears that when the judgment was appealed against to the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Gampaha, the

learned High Court Judges have taken up a different approach although they

have agreed with the determination of the learned Additional District Judge

as to the matters that should be determined, where it has been reproduced in

its verbatim, the portion of the judgment, as I have reproduced earlier.

It appears that the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court, exercising its

civil appellate jurisdiction, has proceeded to consider the identity of the

disputed land and has relied mainly on an answer given by the 1st appellant,

as the 1st defendant before the District Court action, while under cross-

examination on behalf of the respondents.

It has been suggested to him that lot No. 01, 02 and 03 marked in the plan

marked P-12 by the surveyor Lakshman Silva has depicted the said lots as

Godawalewatta a.k.a Helaudakalla to which the witness has answered Yes,

which in my view is a factually correct answer. In plan P-12, the surveyor who

conducted the survey as shown by the respondents has depicted the said lots

in that manner, which does not mean the appellants accepting that as an

existence of a separate land as claimed by the respondents.

I find that the learned High Court Judges of the Provincial High Court in

exercising their civil appellate jurisdiction has been misdirected as to the facts

as well as law in that regard.

It has been determined that even in the plan marked V-01, when

superimposing the plan marked P-10 showing lot No. 01, 02 and 03 in the

said plan as part of Godawalewatta a.k.a Helaudakalla as proof that it is a

separate land other than the land claimed by the appellants as Meegahawatta,

which is also factually wrong.

It is trite law that in a case before a trial Court, be it a criminal action or a

civil action, the Court is duty bound to look at the evidence placed before the

Court in its totality and not in a piecemeal basis, and come to a finding in

that regard. The only difference being that in a criminal action, the case must

be proved against an accused person beyond reasonable doubt, and in a civil

Page 20 of 21

action, like in the action under appeal, the burden of proof should be on the

balance of probability.

I also find that the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court exercising its

appellate jurisdiction was misdirected as to the facts and law, when it was

determined that the defendants in the District Court action have failed to

establish that the disputed portion of land was a part of Meegahawatta as

claimed by them, and also the learned Additional District Judge has

determined the action without properly identifying the disputed land in the

judgment.

I find that it is the duty of the party, who comes before the Court claiming

title to a property and seeking eviction of the opposing party from a part of

the said property, to establish the identity of the land and his title to the

property. It is not obligatory on the part of a defendant to disprove the

plaintiffs case.

It needs to be emphasized that other than considering the establishment of

the identity of the land, the learned High Court Judges, while exercising its

civil appellate jurisdiction has not gone into the title of the respondents to

consider whether they have proved the title to the land as claimed, by

analysing the determinations of the learned Additional District Judge in that

regard, and giving reasons as to why the said determinations are faulty.

For the reasons as stated above, I am of the view that there was no legally

tenable basis for the learned High Court Judges of the Provincial High Court

of the Western Province Holden in Gampaha, while exercising its civil

appellate jurisdiction, to set aside the judgment pronounced by the learned

Additional District Judge in this matter. I am of the view that it is the

judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha that should

stand, as the said judgment had been pronounced by proper analysis of the

facts as well as the relevant law. Hence, I answer all three questions of law

raised in the affirmative.

Accordingly, I set aside the judgment dated 11-07-2018 pronounced by the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Gampaha exercising

Page 21 of 21

its civil appellate jurisdiction, and affirm the judgment dated 27-07-2011

pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge of Gampaha, where the

action instituted by the respondents was dismissed for the reasons as stated

in the said judgment.

The appeal is allowed. There will be no costs of this appeal.
