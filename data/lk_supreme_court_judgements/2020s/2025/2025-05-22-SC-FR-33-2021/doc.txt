P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

1. BACKGROUND:

The Petitioner is a Presidents Counsel and was appointed the Solicitor General of Sri Lanka

with effect from 10-05-2019.1 She was interdicted with effect from 24-09-2019 and

1 Paragraph 02 of the Amended Petition dated 28-12-2022 and Letter of Appointment by the Public Service Commission (P1A).

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 15 of 38

subsequently sent on compulsory leave from 15-10-2020, pending the conclusion of a

preliminary investigation.

By the proclamation issued by His Excellency the President, published in the Gazette

Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09-01-2020,2 a Commission of Inquiry was established in

terms of Section 2 of the Commission of Inquiry Act (Chapter 393) as amended, to inquire

into and obtain information in respect of the alleged political victimizations during the period

commencing from 8th January 2015 and ending on 16th November 2019. His Excellency the

then President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka by the same Proclamation

appointed the 1st to 3rd Respondents to be his commissioners to function in this Commission

of Inquiry. Then His Excellency the President by the proclamation published in the Gazette

extraordinary No. 2159/16 dated 22-01-2020 appointed the 1st Respondent to function as the

chairman of the Commission of Inquiry and also set out its powers in more detail.

The afore-said Commission of Inquiry has conducted several inquiries against several persons.

The Petitioner is one such person. The subject matter of this case primarily revolves around

four inquiries conducted by the 1st to 3rd Respondents in which the Petitioner was identified

as a Respondent. It was the 1st to 3rd Respondents who had functioned respectively as the

Chairman and the other two members of the afore-said Commission of Inquiry.

This Court on the date the Petitioner supported this case, after considering the submissions

of the parties, by its order dated 22-11-2023, has granted the Petitioner Leave to Proceed

with her Petition which has complained of the alleged infringements of her Fundamental

Rights.

The afore-said four inquiries conducted against the Petitioner by the aforesaid Commission of

Inquiry could be identified under the following numbers which presumably the said

Commission of Inquiry had assigned to each one of them. They are:

1. PCI/PV/01/Com./1807/2020

2. PCI/PV/01/Com./77/2020

3. PCI/PV/01/Com./184/2020

4. PCI/PV/01/Com./50/2020

2 Produced by the Petitioner marked P2(a).

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 16 of 38

The Petitioner in the instant Petition seeks to challenge the conclusions and the

recommendations made by the said Commission of Inquiry against her in these four inquiries.

For the purpose of this judgment, I will refer to each of the above inquiry respectively as

Inquiry No. 01-04.

2. PRELIMINARY OBJECTION:

At the commencement of the argument, Mr. Ikram Mohomed, PC who appeared for the 1st -

3rd Respondents, raised a preliminary objection against the maintainability of this Petition on

the ground that there is no Executive or Administrative action which could have infringed the

Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner in the instant case. The learned Presidents Counsel for

the 1st -3rd Respondents advanced this argument on the premise that any action taken by the

three Commissioners of the said Commission of Inquiry does not amount to an Executive or

Administrative action within the meaning of Article 126(1) of the Constitution. It is on that

basis that the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st -3rd Respondents sought to argue that

this Court cannot have jurisdiction to entertain the instant Petition which is an application filed

under Article 17 read with Article 126 (2) of the Constitution in respect of the alleged violation

of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner.

However, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner countered the above Preliminary

Objection citing before Court, the judgment of this Court in Padmini Nirmala Ranawaka

Gunatilake vs. Hon. Upali Abeyrathne and others.3 I observe that the above case relied upon

by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is also a similar petition filed by another

person against whom the same Commission of Inquiry consisting the 1st -3rd Respondents

has conducted an inquiry. Indeed, as can be seen from the said judgment, this Court in that

judgment has decided to entertain those nine Petitions filed by nine different petitioners. The

same Commission of Inquiry consisting the 1st -3rd Respondents has conducted inquires

against all of those nine Petitions. I observe that the same Preliminary Objection has been

raised in all those nine cases. This can be seen from the following passage taken from the

said judgment:

3 SC FRA 27/2021 SC Minutes on 09-08-2024.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 17 of 38

When these matters were supported for granting of Leave to Proceed, Mr. Ikram

Mohomed, PC who represented the 1-3rd Respondents, the three Commissioners

of the Commission of Inquiry, raised a preliminary objection with regard to the

maintainability of these applications based on the ground that there was no

Executive or Administrative decision taken by the three Commissioners and

therefore this Court will have no jurisdiction to entertain the instant applications

filed under Article 17 read with Article 126 (2) for the alleged violation of the

fundamental rights of the Petitioners. 4

I also observe that it is the same Commission of Inquiry which has conducted the inquiries

against the afore-said nine Petitioners which this Court by the said judgment has decided to

quash. The fact that it is the same Commission of Inquiry involved in that case could be seen

from the following paragraph taken from that judgment:

Several Petitioners have come before this Court challenging the

recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry appointed by His Excellency the

President under the Commission of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948 (as amended)

and warrant published in the Government Gazette Extraordinary 2157/44

dated 09-01-2020 and Government Gazette Extraordinary 2159/16

dated 22-01-2020.5 As per warrant published in the Government Gazette

Extraordinary 2157/44 dated 09-01-2020, His Excellency the President had

appointed;

1. Hon. Upaly Abeyrathne

2. Hon. Daya Chandrasiri Jayathilaka and

3. Chandra Fernando 6

Having considered the submissions of the parties, Vijith Malalgoda J (with Achala Wengappuli

J and Arjuna Obeyesekere J agreeing) had decided to overrule the said Preliminary Objection.

To make it clear, let me reproduce the following portion from the said judgment:

4 SC FR 27/2021, SC FR 57/2021, SC FR 58/2021, SC FR 74/2021, SC FR 80/2021, SC FR 115/2021, SC FR 125/2021, SC FR 129/2021, SC FR 132/2021 S. C. Minutes 09-08-2024, at page 52. 5 Emphasis added. 6 SC FR 27/2021, SC FR 57/2021, SC FR 58/2021, SC FR 74/2021, SC FR 80/2021, SC FR 115/2021, SC FR 125/2021, SC FR 129/2021, SC FR 132/2021 S. C. Minutes 09-08-2024, at page 51.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 18 of 38

Now I shall turn to discuss whether the Commission of Inquiry established

under Act No. 17 of 1948 (as amended) carrying on functions that come within

the purview of executive or administrative action as contemplated in Article 17

read with Article 126 of the Constitution.

The Respondents claim that the nature and functions of the said Commission of

Inquiry were quasi-judicial in nature and that quasi-judicial functions are not

amenable to the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court,

purportedly as they do not fall within the scope and ambit of executive or

administrative actions.

However, this claim is misconceived and erroneous as Commission of Inquiry is

investigative or fact finding in nature and is incapable of making any binding

decisions that have any effect on the rights of the parties which makes it starkly

different from judicial tribunal which is capable of making decisions that are

both binding and enforceable subject to appeal.

Any finding or recommendation made by the Commission of Inquiry at the

conclusion of the inquiry is wholly dependent on the executive or administrative

branch of the government for its implementation. Until the executive

implements any findings or recommendations made by a Commission of Inquiry,

such findings or recommendations have no force or avail in law. Therefore, it

could be said that powers and functions exercised by the said Commission is

neither judicial nor quasi-judicial in nature.

The Respondents further claim that Powers, functions, authority vested in the

said Commission of Inquiry which the 1st to 3rd Respondents are the chairman

and members is not an agency or instrumentality of the state as per the

Commission of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948 and therefore not amenable to judicial

review under Article 126 of the Constitution.

However, it is important to note that the then Executive President appointed 1st

- 3rd Respondents as the members of the said Commission of Inquiry to

investigate matters of Political Victimization that allegedly occurred during the

period 08-01-2015 - 16-12-2019 by way of a warrant published in the

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 19 of 38

Government (Extra-Ordinary) Gazette notification bearing No. 2157/44 dated

09-01-2020 by virtue of powers vested in him qua President of the Republic,

under the Commission of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948 (as amended) read together

with Article 33 (2) of the Constitution, under the seal of the Republic. The terms

reference and/or mandate and/or scope of the inquiry of the said Commission

was determined and stipulated by the Executive President. Accordingly, the

source of power of the said Commission of Inquiry and/or its members was

clearly the Executive President.

Since the said Commission of Inquiry was created and/or brought into existence

for the purpose of executing the said mandate of the President, the Commission

was in fact an instrumentality and/or agent of then President/government and

conducted themselves as such and consequently their actions vis a vis the

Petitioners, were executive in nature.

Therefore the contention that the said Commission of Inquiry is not an

instrumentality or agency of the government is untenable.

Thus, this Court in that case has already decided that the actions taken by the afore-said

Commission of Inquiry consisting the 1st -3rd Respondents are Executive or Administrative

action within the meaning of Article 126(1) of the Constitution. I agree with the conclusion

arrived at by Hon. Vijith Malalgoda J. Hence I proceed to overrule the Preliminary Objection

raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st -3rd Respondents that this Court does

not have jurisdiction to entertain the instant application on the afore-said basis.

3. INQUIRY No. 01 - (PCI/PV/01/Com./1807/2020)

The Petitioner in her Petition has made many complaints with regard to the manner in which

the 1st to 3rd Respondents (the Commissioners of this Commission of Inquiry) have conducted

this inquiry against the Petitioner. However, for the speedy disposal of this case, it would

suffice for me to advert to the two primary complaints made by the learned Presidents Counsel

for the Petitioner regarding this inquiry.

The first of those primary complaints relevant to Inquiry No. 01 is based on the argument that

the 32nd Respondent, who stood as the Complainant of the incident relevant to this inquiry,

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 20 of 38

does not fall under any of the four categories of persons set out in the mandate of the

Commission of Inquiry. Therefore, let me at this stage briefly advert to the mandate of the

Commission of Inquiry.

According to the proclamation issued by His Excellency the President, published in the Gazette

Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09-01-2020,7 the mandate given to the Commission of

Inquiry was to investigate and inquire into and obtain information in relation to alleged political

victimization of public officers, employees of state corporations, members of the armed forces

and the police service who held posts during the period commencing 08-01-2015 and ending

on 16-11-2019.

Thus, it is clear from the above proclamation that the Commission of Inquiry was mandated

by the President to investigate and inquire into and obtain information in relation to alleged

political victimization of following four categories of persons. They are (I) Public officers, (II)

Employees of public corporations, (III) Members of the Armed services, and (IV) Members of

the Police service.

This is also clear from the subsequent proclamation made by His Excellency the President

published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2159/16 dated 22-01-2020,8 which reads as

follows:

WHEREAS the Government Officers and employees of State Corporations who

held posts prior to the Presidential Election and/or General Election held in

January and August 2015 respectively, member of the Armed Forces as well as

of the Police Service have been reportedly politically victimized during the period

commencing 08th January 2015 and ending on 16th November 2019 and a

Presidential Commission of Inquiry has been established by the Warrant issued

on 09th January 2020 under the seal of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka in terms of Section 2 of the Commission of Inquiry Act (Chapter 393) as

amended to inquire into and make investigations in relation thereto,

7 Produced by the Petitioner marked P2(a). 8 Produced by the Petitioner marked P 2(b).

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 21 of 38

to be my commissioners to inquire into and obtain information in respect of the

alleged political victimization during the period commencing 8th January 2015 and

ending 16th November 2019

Moreover, the Petitioner has also produced a copy of another proclamation issued by His

Excellency the President published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2201/5 dated 09-11-

2020.9 This was to extend the period of time of the Commission of Inquiry by sixteen days to

enable it to hand over its final report. The said proclamation also has re-iterated the mandate

of the Commission of Inquiry in the following manner:

inquire into and obtain information in relation to alleged Political Victimization

of Public Officers, Employees of State Corporations, Members of the Armed

Forces and the Police Service who held posts during the period commencing 08

January, 2015 and ending on 16th November, 2019.

It is the complaint of the Petitioner that the Commission of Inquiry could never have

entertained the complaint which was the basis of Inquiry No. 01 as it is outside the mandate

given to the commission by His Excellency the President.

The Complainant upon whose complaint the Commission of Inquiry conducted the Inquiry No.

1 is the 32nd Respondent (Waduge Palitha Piyasiri Fernando). The 32nd Respondent has

claimed that he was the Chairman of Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd. which is a company

incorporated in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the 32nd Respondent has retired from public service

in the Army a long time ago. In those circumstances, it was the complaint made by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner that the 32nd Respondent, who stood as the said

Complainant relevant to Inquiry No.01, does not fall under any of the four categories of

persons set out in the mandate of the said Commission of Inquiry.

Indeed, even according to the report of the Commission of Inquiry in relation to Inquiry No.

01,10 the 32nd Respondent had retired from the Sri Lanka Army as far back as 31-12-2001.11

This is almost twenty years before this Commission of Inquiry was set up by the proclamation

published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09-01-2020. According to the report

9 Produced by the Petitioner marked P2(c). 10 Produced by the Petitioner marked [P4(1)]. 11 Page 1067 of the Report.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 22 of 38

of the Commission of Inquiry in relation to Inquiry No. 01, the 32nd Respondent had resigned

from the chairmanship of Rakna Lanka Ltd. on 26-01-2015. The report further states that

Rakna Lanka Ltd. is a company incorporated under Companies Act. Therefore, it does not fall

under the category of Public Corporation identified in the mandate. This clearly show that the

Commission of Inquiry could never have entertained the complaint made to it by the 32nd

Respondent which triggered Inquiry No. 01. This is because the 32nd Respondent does not fall

within the category of persons whose alleged political victimization could lawfully have been

the subject matter of any investigation or inquiry by the Commission of Inquiry. Thus, such

an investigation or inquiry is clearly outside the mandate given to the Commission of Inquiry

by His Excellency the President.

The second of those primary complaints relevant to Inquiry No. 01 is based on the argument

that the Commission of Inquiry has not taken any interest to notify the Petitioner of the

conduct of this inquiry. Petitioner has produced the decision of the aforesaid Presidential

Commission of Inquiry with regard to the Inquiry No. 01 marked P4 (1) (Item No. 9 XXXII -

1807/2020). On the first page of P4 (1) itself, the name of the Petitioner has been mentioned

as the 12th Respondent in a list of Respondents. Let me at this stage reproduce here two

important sections from the Commissions of Inquiry Act:

Commissions of Inquiry Act Section 16

Every person whose conduct is the subject of inquiry under this Act, or who is in any

way implicated or concerned in the matter under inquiry, shall be entitled to be

represented by one or more attorneys-at-law at the whole of the inquiry;12

and any other person who may consider it desirable that he should be so represented

may, by leave of the commission, be represented in the manner aforesaid,

Commissions of Inquiry Act Section 23

Where a Commission of Inquiry appointed in terms of this Act, has been required by

the President to conduct an investigation or inquiry or both an investigation and inquiry

into any matter or incident, notwithstanding the generality of the powers conferred on

such Commission, it shall be entitled to obtain the assistance of a public officer selected

by the Commission, with the concurrence of the relevant appointing authority, and

12 Emphasis added.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 23 of 38

through such officer cause the conduct of investigations into any relevant matter or

incident under its direction and supervision :

Provided however, the Commission shall not arrive at any conclusion on such matter

or incident investigated into, unless the Commission has examined the material

collected in the course of such investigation and inquired into such matter or incident,

observing the rules of natural justice.13

In the decision marked P4 (1) the Commission has recorded the following paragraph:

2020.10.26

16 1 12

.

. 14

Neither the learned Senior Additional Solicitor General nor the learned Presidents Counsel

who appeared for the Commissioners (1st to 3rd Respondents) had submitted any

documentation to establish that the Commission of Inquiry indeed had complied with the

provisions of Section 16.

To the contrary, the Petitioner has averred in her affidavit that she never received any

notification from the Commission informing her about the conduct of this inquiry against her.

This could be seen from paragraph 37 of her affidavit which is as follows:

37. I categorically state that I did not receive any Summons, notice or

communication from the Commission of Inquiry with regard to the aforesaid

Inquiry bearing No. PCI/PV/01/COM./1807/2020. 15

Mr. Ikram Mohommed, PC who appeared for the 1st to 3rd Respondents submitted to Court

that the 1st to 3rd Respondents merely performed the role of the Inquirers as per provisions

of the Commissions of Inquiry Act. It is the position of the 1st to 3rd Respondents that they do

not possess any documentation pertaining to this inquiry. Although the 1st to 3rd Respondents

13 Emphasis added. 14 Page 63 of Volume I. 15 Paragraph 37 of Affidavit from Volume IV.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 24 of 38

in their affidavits filed before this Court have stated that they complied with the Rules of

Natural Justice when conducting this inquiry against the Petitioner, the said fact is not

substantiated by any document either by the learned Senior Assistant Solicitor General or by

the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st to 3rd Respondents.

The Commissioners in the decision [P4 (1)] have not described the way in which they had

complied with the Rules of Natural Justice when conducting this inquiry against the Petitioner.

Thus, the only acceptable version available before this Court with regard to the manner in

which this inquiry was conducted by the 1st to 3rd Respondents is the version of the Petitioner.

This is because the duty to comply with the Rules of Natural Justice when conducting this

inquiry against the Petitioner is on the 1st to 3rd Respondents. The inference I can draw from

the above material is the fact that the 1st to 3rd Respondents have failed to establish that they

have complied with the Rules of Natural Justice when conducting this inquiry against the

Petitioner.

I have already held above, that the Commission of Inquiry could never have entertained the

complaint made to it by the 32nd Respondent which triggered Inquiry No. 01. The Petitioner

could have brought the above illegality before the Commission of Inquiry had she been given

notice of the impending proceedings against her by the Commission. I have already

reproduced above, Sections 16 and 23 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act. The plain reading

of these sections show that the compliance of those provisions are mandatory. I observe that

despite the presence of those specific requirement in these provisions of law, the 1st - 3rd

Respondents have failed to observe the Rules of Natural Justice in the course of this inquiry.

The compliance of these Rules has been made mandatory by those specific provisions of law

before the 1st - 3rd Respondents could have arrived at any conclusion/recommendation adverse

to the Petitioner.

4. INQUIRY No. 2 - (PCI/PV/01/Com./77/2020)

The Complainant with regard to the inquiry No. 2 is Chief Inspector Pilapitiya of CIABOC. The

said Complainant has alleged that he was transferred out of CIABOC by the Petitioner, who

at that time had functioned as the Director General of CIABOC, for the reason that the said

Complainant did not assist the Petitioner to fabricate evidence against the then President, Mr.

Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 25 of 38

The Petitioner in her affidavit has stated that she became aware that this inquiry was

proceeding against her by the Commission of Inquiry through the newspaper report which

she has produced with her Petition marked P7. Immediately after she became aware of the

said proceedings from the media, the Petitioner has written the letter P8 to the Commission

of Inquiry on the very next day i.e., 20-10-2020. Thereafter, the Petitioner had received

summons around 11.20 a. m. on 23-10-2020 which had required the Petitioner to appear

before the Commission of Inquiry at 6 p. m. on the same day. Consequently on 23-10-2020

itself, the Petitioner had filed the Motion (P9) before the Commission of Inquiry requesting

copies of the Complaints; the statements recorded by the investigation officers; all the other

relevant documents; and copies of all relevant proceedings. The Petitioner through the same

Motion had also requested that she be granted at least seven days which was to be counted

from the date of handing over the requested material to her, to enable her to study the said

material before she could actively participate in the inquiry.

Petitioner has stated in her affidavit that the 33rd Respondent has moved for a postponement

of the inquiry on 23-10-2020 and got the inquiry refixed for 26-10-2020.

Thereafter, the Petitioner has filed another Motion marked P10 on 26-10-2020 to inform the

Commission of Inquiry that she had not received the requested material requested through

the Motion dated 23-10-2020. However, the Petitioner states that the Commission of Inquiry,

disregarding all the afore-stated requests made by the Petitioner, had proceeded to conclude

the inquiry. It is on that basis that the Petitioner complains that the 1st - 3rd Respondents

being the members of the Commission of Inquiry did not provide the Petitioner with any

reasonable opportunity to defend herself before the Commission decided to make an adverse

recommendation against her.

The findings / conclusions and recommendations made by the Commission against the

Petitioner at the end of this inquiry is as follows :

1.

2.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 26 of 38

.

As has been pointed out by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner the above

paragraph taken from the report shows that the findings / conclusions arrived at by the 1st -

3rd Respondents against the Petitioner are adverse conclusions.

Thus, in the above circumstances, it is clear to me that the Commission of Inquiry consisting

of 1st - 3rd Respondents has failed to comply with the Rules of Natural Justice. This is despite

the presence of a specific requirement in law, namely, Sections 16 and 23 of the Commissions

of Inquiry Act. Therefore, I have to hold that the 1st - 3rd Respondents have failed to comply

with those provisions of law in the Commissions of Inquiry Act before they arrived at the

conclusion/recommendation which was clearly adverse to the Petitioner. Thus, I hold that the

1st - 3rd Respondents in this instance have clearly acted outside law to make adverse findings

against the Petitioner due to their failure to follow mandatory steps specified in law.

I have already mentioned above that the duty to comply with the Rules of Natural Justice

when conducting this inquiry against the Petitioner is on the 1st to 3rd Respondents. They have

not submitted any documentation pertaining to this inquiry. Moreover, the Commissioners in

their decision [P4 (2)] have not described the way in which they had complied with the Rules

of Natural Justice when conducting this inquiry against the Petitioner. Thus, the inference I

can draw from the above material is the fact that the 1st to 3rd Respondents have failed to

establish that they have complied with the Rules of Natural Justice when conducting this

inquiry against the Petitioner.

5. INQUIRY No. 3 - (PCI/PV/01/Com./184/2020)

The Complainant with regard to this inquiry is the 34th Respondent, Mr. Rohitha Bogollagama.

The 34th Respondent has alleged that the Chairman of CIABOC was instrumental in filing

charges against him at the Magistrates Court under and in terms of the Bribery Act.

It is the position of the Petitioner that the CIABOC has initiated investigations against the 34th

Respondent in 2006 which is outside the time limit of the mandate given to the Commission

of Inquiry. The Petitioner also submits that the said investigation was conducted by the

CIABOC well before the Petitioner assumed office as the Director General of CIABOC.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 27 of 38

The Petitioner also complained that the Complainant Mr. Rohitha Bogollagama, the 34th

Respondent, did not fall under any of the four categories of persons mentioned in the mandate

of the Commission of Inquiry given by His Excellency the President.

The Petitioner has produced the report of the Commission of Inquiry in relation to Inquiry No.

03 marked P4 (3). Even according to the said report there is no material to establish that

the 34th Respondent falls under any of the four categories i.e., (I) Public officers, (II)

Employees of public corporations, (III) Members of the Armed services, (IV) Members of the

Police service. Thus, the Commission of Inquiry could never have entertained the complaint

made to it by the 34th Respondent which triggered Inquiry No. 03 as the 34th Respondent does

not fall within the category of persons whose alleged political victimization could lawfully have

been the subject matter of any investigation or inquiry by the Commission of Inquiry. Thus,

such an investigation or inquiry is clearly outside the mandate given to the commission by His

Excellency the President.

The Petitioner has also brought to the notice of this Court that her successor in office, following

the withdrawal of the charges in the Magistrates Court at the first instance, had taken steps

to forward an indictment to the High Court against the 34th Respondent on the same line of

charges. The Petitioner has also brought to the notice of this Court that the Supreme Court

has issued a Rule (SC Rule 02/2013) against the 34th Respondent who had failed to respond

to notices issued by the CIABOC. This too had happened well before the starting point of the

time period mentioned in the mandate of the Commission.

Petitioner also complains that the Commission of Inquiry did not issue summons on witnesses

she wanted to summon to give evidence on her behalf before the Commission of Inquiry. Be

that as it may, the findings / conclusions arrived at by the Commission of Inquiry with regard

to inquiry No. 3 is as follows:

1.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 28 of 38

.

2.

. 16

The above paragraphs taken from the report P4 (3) shows that the findings / conclusions

arrived at by the 1st - 3rd Respondents against the Petitioner are adverse conclusions.

I have already adverted to above, the proclamation issued by His Excellency the President,

published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09-01-2020.17 Accordingly, the

mandate given to the Commission of Inquiry was to investigate and inquire into and obtain

information in relation to alleged political victimization of public officers, employees of state

corporations, members of the armed forces and the police service who held posts during the

period commencing 08-01-2015 and ending on 16-11-2019.

The fact that the Commission of Inquiry was mandated by the President to investigate and

inquire into and obtain information in relation to alleged political victimization of the following

four categories of persons i.e., (I) Public officers, (II) Employees of public corporations, (III)

Members of the Armed services, and (IV) Members of the Police service is also clear from the

subsequent proclamation made by His Excellency the President published in the Gazette

Extraordinary No. 2159/16 dated 22-01-2020.18 As I have shown above, the proclamation

issued by His Excellency the President published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2201/5

dated 09-11-2020,19 to extend the period of time of the Commission of Inquiry by sixteen

days to enable it to hand over its final report, has also made the above position clear.

16 Paragraph 156 of the further written submissions by the Petitioner dated 28-01-2025. 17 Produced by the Petitioner marked P2(a). 18 Produced by the Petitioner marked P2(b). 19 Produced by the Petitioner marked P2(c).

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 29 of 38

The 34th Respondent does not fall within the category of persons whose alleged victimization

could lawfully have been the subject matter of any investigation or inquiry by the Commission

of Inquiry. Therefore, the Commission of Inquiry could never have entertained the complaint

made to it by the 34th Respondent which triggered Inquiry No. 03. Thus, such an investigation

or inquiry is clearly outside the mandate given to the commission by His Excellency the

President.

6. INQUIRY No. 4 - (PCI/PV/01/Com./50/2020)

The Complainant with regard to inquiry No. 04 is the 35th Respondent, Mr. Nissanka

Senadhipathi. The Petitioner has produced the relevant complaint marked P23. In the said

complaint, the 35th Respondent had alleged that the Petitioner had subjected him to political

victimization alleging that the agreements in respect of Avant Garde Maritime Services Pvt.

Ltd., of which he is the Chairman, were unlawfully terminated and its operations were taken

over by the Sri Lanka Navy. The Petitioner complains that the 35th Respondent does not fall

under any of the four categories of persons set out in the mandate given to the Commission

of Inquiry by His Excellency the President. Petitioner states that the 35th Respondent has

retired from the public service in the Army in 1996. The 35th Respondent is admittedly the

Chairman of a private company. Even the Honorable Attorney General in his letter dated 22-

07-2020 addressed to the Commission (this letter is marked P29) has stated the followings:

In this context, I note that the Mandate of the CoI as set out in the Notification

published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2159/16 dated 22nd January 2020, the

Mandate of the COI is to inquire into allegations of political victimization of public

officers, employees of public corporations, and members of the armed forces and

police service who held such office prior to the Presidential Elections and/or

General Elections held respectively in January and August 2015, being persons

who had either resigned from or otherwise ceased to hold public office with the

change of Government or continued to hold such office after such change, during

the period commencing 08th January 2015 and ending 16th November 2016.

I also note from the title of the CoI that, having undertaken such

Mandate, the Commission itself has decided to confine its scope of

inquiry into allegations made by the said categories of persons.

However, a complaint from the said Complainant, Mr. Nissanka

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 30 of 38

Senadhipathi, who does not fall within any of the said categories of

persons appears to have been entertained and is being inquired into by

the CoI.

[]

Reiterating my observations above with regard to the Mandate of the CoI as set

out in the Notification published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09th

January 2020, it appears that the purported Complainant has no locus standi to

appear before and be heard by the CoI.

[]

In addition to the above, your attention is drawn to the fact that the Complainant

is an Accused in the aforesaid cases pending before judicial fora, i.e., in Case No.

TAB/751/2019 in the High Court of Colombo and Case No. HCB/25/2017 in the

High Court of Colombo. Therefore, the matters in respect of which an officer of

the Attorney Generals Department has been summoned as a person of interest

are sub judice.

[]

It is clearly an attempt on the part of the Complainant to abuse the Mandate

and process of the CoI for the collateral purpose of intimidating, harassing and

embarrassing such officer and obstructing the discharge of his professional duties

as a public officer, thereby attempting to derail the prosecution, subvert the

course of justice and interfere with the judiciary, to the illegal and unlawful

advantage of the Complainant. 20

Thus, it is clear that the 1st - 3rd Respondents could not have lawfully entertained the complaint

made by the 35th Respondent. Therefore, the 1st - 3rd Respondents also could not have

conducted an inquiry against the Petitioner on such a complaint and arrived at conclusions

20 Paragraph 180 of the further written submissions by the Petitioner dated 28-01-2025.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 31 of 38

and made adverse recommendations against the Petitioner. The findings / conclusions arrived

at by the 1st - 3rd Respondents against the Petitioner with regard to inquiry No. 04 is as follows:

1. 189

191 ,

2. , 100

,

3. , 70

,

4. .

5. ..

6.

.

7. .

8. .

Furthermore, the following paragraphs taken from the report P4 (4) also show that the

findings / conclusions arrived at by the 1st - 3rd Respondents against the Petitioner are adverse

conclusions.

32528/15 44146

.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 32 of 38

3. HCB 25/2017

.21

In addition to the above, the Petitioner also complains that the Commission of Inquiry failed

to serve summons on her and concluded the inquiry and made recommendations adverse to

her in her absence. It is the position of the Petitioner that the Commission of Inquiry had

decided to issue summons on Respondents identified by the Commission only after the 35th

Respondents evidence was concluded.

I have already adverted to the fact that the Commission of Inquiry was mandated by the

President to investigate and inquire into alleged political victimization of the following four

categories of persons only, i.e., (I) Public officers, (II) Employees of public corporations, (III)

Members of the Armed services, (IV) Members of the Police service. In order to establish this

fact, I have also already referred to the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09-01-

2020,22 the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2159/16 dated 22-01-2020,23 and the Gazette

Extraordinary No. 2201/5 dated 09-11-2020.24 It is clear that the 34th Respondent does not

fall within any of the categories of persons whose alleged victimization could lawfully have

been the subject matter of any investigation or inquiry by this Commission of Inquiry.

Therefore, the Commission of Inquiry could never have entertained the complaint made to it

by the 34th Respondent. It is that complaint which has triggered Inquiry No. 04. Thus, such

an investigation or inquiry is clearly outside the mandate given to the commission by His

Excellency the President.

7. GENERAL UNACCEPTABILITY OF THE REPORTS OF THE INQUIRIES:

In addition to the above material, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted

that His Excellency the President who appointed 1st - 3rd Respondents by the afore-said

Proclamations has subsequently decided to seek further scrutiny of the findings of their

Commission of Inquiry. I observe that it is a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry that

His Excellency the President has appointed by the proclamation published in Gazette No.

21 Paragraph 238 of the further written submissions by the Petitioner dated 28-01-2025. 22 Produced by the Petitioner marked P2(a). 23 Produced by the Petitioner marked P2(b). 24 Produced by the Petitioner marked P2(c).

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 33 of 38

2221/54 dated 01-04-2021. The 31st Respondent (Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers) has

produced the said proclamation marked (R5) which has stated as follows:

And whereas, now, I am of the considered view that in consideration of the

several specific findings, decisions and recommendations made against and/or in

respect of the specific persons identified in the said report submitted to me by

the Presidential Commission of Inquiry constituted by me by the warrant issued

on 9th of January 2020, under the seal of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka in terms of Section 2 of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Act

(Chapter 393) as amended, that such specific findings, decisions and

recommendations contained in the said Report, in respect of all such identified

persons, should inter-alia in the public interest and for purposes of greater

scrutiny, be further inquired into by you, and to report to me on the suitability

and the justifications, if any, for the implementation and enforcement of the said

findings, decisions and recommendations contained in the said Report of the

Presidential Commission of Inquiry, as well as for the adoption of any action in

respect thereof.25

Thus, it could be seen that His Excellency the President by the proclamation R5 had appointed

two Judges of this Court along with another Judge of the Court of Appeal in terms of Section

2 of the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry Law No. 07 of 1978 to inquire into and

report on the suitability and the justifications, if any, for the implementation and enforcement

of the findings / recommendations contained in the reports of the Commission of Inquiry

submitted to His Excellency by the 1st - 3rd Respondents with regard to the investigations that

it had conducted. The aforementioned four inquiries are amongst them.

It is common ground that His Excellency the President did not extend the time given to the

said Special Presidential Commission appointed by the said proclamation (R5) after its term

came to an end. This led to a situation where the said Special Presidential Commission of

Inquiry was unable to submit any report to His Excellency the President on the suitability and

justifications if any for the implementation and enforcement of the findings / decisions /

recommendations contained in the report prepared and submitted by the 1st -3rd Respondents

25 Portion marked X, page 49, annexure R5 of Volume IV.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 34 of 38

with regard to the inquiries it conducted. The aforesaid four inquiries against the Petitioner

were among them.

Learned Additional Solicitor General Mr. Milinda Gunatilleke PC who appeared for the Secretary

to the Cabinet of Ministers drew the attention of Court to the cabinet decision marked R8. It

is the 31st Respondent (Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers) who has produced this document

R8. The relevant part of this cabinet decision (R8) is as follows:

39. The Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed on 2020-01-09 to inquire into

Political Victimization and the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed on

2021-01-28 - the Secretary to the Cabinet tabled at this meeting, a letter dated 2022-

10-07 sent by the Attorney General addressed to him -

1. Informing the judgment of the Court of Appeal pertaining to C. A. (Writ)

Application No. 173/2021 in which the Court of Appeal has issued writs

quashing the recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry

appointed on 2020-01-09 and the relevant decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers

respectively, with regard to the Petitioner of the said Application Mr. Janaka

Bandara, an officer of the Attorney Generals Department, and the following

matters:

a) That, there are more than ten (10) other Applications pending before

the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, challenging the findings /

recommendations of the aforesaid Presidential Commission of Inquiry;

b) That, the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed on

2021-01-28 to further inquire into the recommendations of the said

Presidential Commission of Inquiry, has ceased to exist without

submitting its findings / recommendations; and

2. Requesting to bring the above matters to the cognizance of the Cabinet of

Ministers to take a policy decision as to whether any of the findings,

decisions and recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry

appointed on 2020-01-09 should be relied upon and consequential steps

taken thereon, in the aforesaid context.

The Secretary to the Cabinet further informed the Cabinet -

(I) That, the following institutions have confirmed that they have not taken

any action in terms of the Cabinet decision dated 2021-01-18 on CP No.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 35 of 38

21/0105/301/003 (as amended on 2021-02-15) to implement the

recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed

on 2020-01-09 :

The Public Service Commission by letter dated 2022-10-26;

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption by letter dated 2022-10-27;

The Attorney Generals Department by letter dated 2022-12-27;

and

(II) That, the Inspector General of Police by his letter dated 2022-10-27 has

submitted a Report on the progress of the investigations and court

cases referred to in the recommendations of the Presidential

Commission of Inquiry appointed on 2020-01-09.

After discussion, the Cabinet observed -

i. That, the relevant authorities referred to above, other than the Sri

Lanka Police, have confirmed that they have not taken any action to

implement the recommendations of the Presidential Commission of

Inquiry appointed on 2020-01-09; and

ii. That, since the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed on

2021-01-28 by the then President has ceased to exist without

submitting its findings / recommendations, the contention taken up by

Mr. Sanjeewa Jayawardena, Presidents Counsel on behalf of the

Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers in CA (Writ) Applications No.

173/2021 and No. 174/2021 and by the Attorney General on behalf of

the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers in other Applications before

the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court pertaining to this matter,

appears to have no further validity.

After further discussion, the Cabinet decided -

a. That, the Cabinet of Ministers should not further intervene in this

matter; and

b. To direct the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers to intimate the

decision referred to at (a) above to the Attorney General for necessary

action. 26

26 Paragraph 39, Page 58, 59, 60 of the English Version of the Cabinet decision marked R8 in Volume IV of the proceedings.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 36 of 38

Moreover, the learned Additional Solicitor General Mr. Dilan Rathnayake, PC, who appeared

for the 36th, 37th and 38th Respondents (CIABOC), drew the attention of Court to the decision

made by the CIABOC not to implement any of the recommendations made by the 1st - 3rd

Respondents subsequent to the inquiries made by them in respect of the aforesaid four

inquiries.

The above developments show clearly that all authorities concerned have by now decided to

ignore the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry which consisted of the 1st

3rd Respondents. Furthermore, I also observe that the Cabinet of Ministers as per R8, has also

decided against taking any further action on the recommendations made by the Commission

of Inquiry consisting of the 1st - 3rd Respondents subsequent to the inquiries they had

conducted.

8. CONCLUSION:

Thus, for the reasons I have stated above, I hold that there is no material to hold that the 1st

- 3rd Respondents have complied with Section 16 and Section 23 of the Commissions of Inquiry

Act before making the impugned adverse recommendations against the Petitioner. I am also

of the view that there is ample material before Court to conclude that the 1st - 3rd Respondents

have failed to conduct lawful inquiries in relation to the afore-stated four complaints. For the

foregoing reasons I hold that the Petitioner is entitled to succeed with her Petition.

In this judgment, I have held that the 1st - 3rd Respondents could never have entertained the

complaint made to it by the 32nd Respondent which triggered Inquiry No. 01 as the 32nd

Respondent does not fall within the category of persons whose alleged victimization could

lawfully have been the subject matter of any investigation or inquiry by the Commission of

Inquiry. I have also held that the 1st - 3rd Respondents, having unlawfully entertained the

complaint made to it by the 32nd Respondent, then arrived at the conclusion/recommendation

which was adverse to the Petitioner in the said Inquiry No. 01 without complying with the

mandatory requirements in law as per Sections 16 and 23 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act.

Therefore, with regard to Inquiry No. 01, I grant to the Petitioner, a declaration that the

fundamental right of the Petitioner guaranteed by Articles 12(1) of the Constitution, has been

infringed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents.

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 37 of 38

I proceed to quash the Final Report of Inquiry No. 01 (PCI/PV/01/Com./1807/2020) (also

identified as Item No. 9 XXXII - 1807/2020) produced by the Petitioner marked P4 (1) which

contains the findings, decisions and recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry conducted

by the 1st to 3rd Respondents.

I have held that the 1st - 3rd Respondents have conducted Inquiry No. 02

(PCI/PV/01/Com./77/2020) without complying with the specific mandatory requirements in

law as per Sections 16 and 23 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act before they arrived at the

conclusion/recommendation which was clearly adverse to the Petitioner. Therefore, with

regard to Inquiry No. 02, I grant to the Petitioner, a declaration that the fundamental right of

the Petitioner guaranteed by Articles 12(1) of the Constitution, has been infringed by the 1st,

2nd and 3rd Respondents. Therefore, I proceed to quash the Final Report of Inquiry No. 02

(PCI/PV/01/Com./77/2020) (also identified as Item No. 9 XLIV) produced by the Petitioner

marked P4 (2) which contains the findings, decisions and recommendations of the

Commission of Inquiry conducted by the 1st to 3rd Respondents.

In this judgment, I have held that the 1st - 3rd Respondents could never have entertained the

complaint made to it by the 34th Respondent which triggered Inquiry No. 03 as the 34th

Respondent does not fall within the category of persons whose alleged victimization could

lawfully have been the subject matter of any investigation or inquiry by the Commission of

Inquiry. I have also held that the 1st - 3rd Respondents, having unlawfully entertained the

complaint made to it by the 32nd Respondent, then arrived at the conclusion/recommendation

which was adverse to the Petitioner in the said Inquiry No. 03. Therefore, with regard to

Inquiry No. 03, I grant to the Petitioner, a declaration that the fundamental right of the

Petitioner guaranteed by Articles 12(1) of the Constitution, has been infringed by the 1st, 2nd

and 3rd Respondents. I proceed to quash the Final Report of Inquiry No. 03

(PCI/PV/01/Com./184/2020) (also identified as Item No. 9 XXXIV) produced by the Petitioner

marked P4 (3) which contains the findings, decisions and recommendations of the

Commission of Inquiry conducted by the 1st to 3rd Respondents.

In this judgment I have held that the 1st - 3rd Respondents could never have entertained the

complaint made to it by the 32nd Respondent which triggered Inquiry No. 04

(PCI/PV/01/Com./50/2020) as the 35th Respondent does not fall within the category of

persons whose alleged victimization could lawfully have been the subject matter of any

investigation or inquiry by the Commission of Inquiry. Thus, such an investigation or inquiry

[SC/FRA/33/2021] Page 38 of 38

relevant to Inquiry No. 04 (PCI/PV/01/Com./50/2020) is clearly outside the mandate given to

the Commission of Inquiry by His Excellency the President. Therefore, with regard to Inquiry

No. 04, I grant to the Petitioner, a declaration that the fundamental right of the Petitioner

guaranteed by Articles 12(1) of the Constitution, has been infringed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Respondents. Therefore, I proceed to quash the Final Report of Inquiry No. 04

(PCI/PV/01/Com./50/2020) (also identified as Item No. 9 XXXI) produced by the Petitioner

marked P4 (4) which contains the findings, decisions and recommendations of the

Commission of Inquiry conducted by the 1st to 3rd Respondents.
