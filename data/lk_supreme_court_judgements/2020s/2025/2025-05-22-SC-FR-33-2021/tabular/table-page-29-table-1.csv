"The 34th Respondent does not fall within the category of persons whose alleged victimization"
"could lawfully have been the subject matter of any investigation or inquiry by the Commission"
"of Inquiry. Therefore, the Commission of Inquiry could never have entertained the complaint"

"or  inquiry  is  clearly  outside  the  mandate  given  to  the  commission  by  His  Excellency  the"
"President."
