"M
oreover, the learned Additional Solicitor General Mr. Dilan Rathnayake, PC, who appeared"
"for the 36th, 37th and 38th Respondents (CIABOC), drew the attention of Court to the decision"
"made by the CIABOC  not  to implement any  of the recommendations made by the 1st  -  3rd"
"Respondents  subsequent  to  the  inquiries  made  by  them  in  respect  of  the  aforesaid  four"
"inquiries."
"T
he above developments show clearly that all authorities concerned have by now decided to"
"ignore the recommendations made by the Commission of Inquiry which consisted of the 1st â€“"
"3rd Respondents. Furthermore, I also observe that the Cabinet of Ministers as per R8, has also"
"decided against taking any further action on the recommendations made by the Commission"
"of  Inquiry  consisting  of  the  1st  -  3rd  Respondents  subsequent  to  the  inquiries  they  had"
"conducted."
"8.  CONCLUSION:"
"T
hus, for the reasons I have stated above, I hold that there is no material to hold that the 1st"
"- 3rd Respondents have complied with Section 16 and Section 23 of the Commissions of Inquiry"
"Act before making the impugned adverse recommendations against the Petitioner. I am also"
"of the view that there is ample material before Court to conclude that the 1st - 3rd Respondents"
"have failed to conduct lawful inquiries in relation to the afore-stated four complaints. For the"
"foregoing reasons I hold that the Petitioner is entitled to succeed with her Petition."
"I
n this judgment, I have held that the 1st - 3rd Respondents could never have entertained the"
"complaint  made  to  it  by  the  32nd  Respondent  which  triggered  Inquiry  No.  01  as  the  32nd"
"Respondent  does  not  fall  within  the  category  of persons  whose  alleged  victimization  could"
"lawfully have been the subject matter of any investigation or inquiry by the Commission of"
"Inquiry.  I  have  also  held  that  the  1st -  3rd  Respondents,  having  unlawfully  entertained  the"
"complaint made to it by the 32nd Respondent, then arrived at the conclusion/recommendation"
"which was adverse to the Petitioner in the said Inquiry No. 01 without complying  with  the"
"mandatory requirements in law as per Sections 16 and 23 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act."
"Therefore,  with  regard  to  Inquiry  No.  01,  I  grant  to  the  Petitioner,  a  declaration  that  the"
"fundamental right of the Petitioner guaranteed by Articles 12(1) of the Constitution, has been"
"infringed by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents."
