"A
s  has  been  pointed  out  by  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  the  above"
"paragraph taken from the report shows that the findings / conclusions arrived at by the 1st -"
"3rd Respondents against the Petitioner are adverse conclusions."
"T
hus, in the above circumstances, it is clear to me that the Commission of Inquiry consisting"
"of 1st - 3rd Respondents has failed to comply with the Rules of Natural Justice. This is despite"
"the presence of a specific requirement in law, namely, Sections 16 and 23 of the Commissions"
"of Inquiry Act. Therefore, I have to hold that the 1st - 3rd Respondents have failed to comply"
"with  those  provisions  of  law  in  the  Commissions  of  Inquiry  Act  before  they  arrived  at  the"
"conclusion/recommendation which was clearly adverse to the Petitioner. Thus, I hold that the"
"1st - 3rd Respondents in this instance have clearly acted outside law to make adverse findings"
"against the Petitioner due to their failure to follow mandatory steps specified in law."
"I
 have already mentioned above that the duty to  comply with the  Rules of Natural Justice"
"when conducting this inquiry against the Petitioner is on the 1st to 3rd Respondents. They have"
"not submitted any documentation pertaining to this inquiry. Moreover, the Commissioners in"
"their decision [P4 (2)] have not described the way in which they had complied with the Rules"
"of Natural Justice when conducting this inquiry against the Petitioner. Thus, the inference I"
"can draw from the above material is the fact that the 1st to 3rd Respondents have failed to"
"establish  that  they  have  complied  with  the  Rules  of  Natural  Justice  when  conducting  this"
"inquiry against the Petitioner."
"5.  INQUIRY No. 3 - (PCI/PV/01/Com./184/2020)"
"T
he Complainant with regard to this inquiry is the 34th Respondent, Mr. Rohitha Bogollagama."
"The  34th  Respondent  has  alleged  that  the  Chairman  of  CIABOC  was  instrumental  in  filing"
"charges against him at the Magistrate’s Court under and in terms of the Bribery Act."
"I
t is the position of the Petitioner that the CIABOC has initiated investigations against the 34th"
"Respondent in 2006 which is outside the time limit of the mandate given to the Commission"
"of  Inquiry.  The  Petitioner  also  submits  that  the  said  investigation  was  conducted  by  the"
"CIABOC well before the Petitioner assumed office as the Director General of CIABOC."
