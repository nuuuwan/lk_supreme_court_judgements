"of the Commission of Inquiry in relation to Inquiry No. 01, the 32nd Respondent had resigned"
"from  the  chairmanship  of  Rakna  Lanka  Ltd.  on  26-01-2015.  The  report  further  states  that"
"Rakna Lanka Ltd. is a company incorporated under Companies Act. Therefore, it does not fall"
"under the category of Public Corporation identified in the mandate. This clearly show that the"
"Commission  of  Inquiry  could  never  have  entertained  the  complaint  made  to  it  by  the  32nd"
"Respondent which triggered Inquiry No. 01. This is because the 32nd Respondent does not fall"
"within the category of persons whose alleged political victimization could lawfully have been"
"the subject matter of any investigation or inquiry by the Commission of Inquiry. Thus, such"
"an investigation or inquiry is clearly outside the mandate given to the Commission of Inquiry"
"by His Excellency the President."
