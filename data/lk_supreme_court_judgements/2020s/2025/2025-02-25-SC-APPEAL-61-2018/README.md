Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Balangoda seeking,

inter alia, a declaration that the contract entered into between the

plaintiff and the defendant university marked P9, regarding a

construction project at the university, was breached by the defendant;

the recovery of a sum of Rs. 23,804,815.00 based on the three bills

submitted by the plaintiff to the defendant marked P12, P14 and P15;

and damages in several forms. The defendant sought the dismissal of the

plaintiffs action and made a claim in reconvention to recover the excess

amount paid to the plaintiff. After trial, the District Court rejected the

claims of both parties predominantly on the basis that neither party had

sufficiently established their claims, and dismissed the action.

On appeal by the plaintiff to the High Court of Civil Appeal of Ratnapura,

the High Court set aside the judgment of the District Court and entered

judgment in favour of the plaintiff for a sum of Rs. 12,395,554.98. This

appeal with leave obtained by the defendant is against the judgment of

the High Court.

The High Court, after analysing the evidence, came to the finding that:

The facts stated above strongly suggest that the bills were a sham.

3

SC/APPEAL/61/2018

Having come to that strong finding, the High Court proceeded to enter

judgment for the plaintiff in a sum of Rs. 12,395,554.98 on the basis

that:

However, with regard to the 2nd bill, beside the lapse of the

defendants, there is an unequivocal admission made by the

defendants. As I have stated above, by P17 Registrar of the 1st

defendant university has unconditionally admitted bill No.2,

referring to its amount as well. Furthermore, he has undertaken the

payment of the said sum once funds are received. Hence, in my view,

defendants are not entitled to go back from their own admission and

challenge the bill later.

The claim of the plaintiff on the second bill is for a sum of Rs.

14,000,952.00. The High Court decided to grant the full sum of Rs.

14,000,952.00 based on P17 but, after deducting the amounts already

paid to the plaintiff, concluded that the balance payment due was Rs.

12,395,554.98.

For the reasons stated above I am of the view that the Defendants

are liable to pay the Plaintiff the sum of Rs. 14,000,952.00 in the 2nd

bill. However, Plaintiff has admitted that firstly he received Rs.

200,000/= for the bills tendered by him. Again he has received Rs.

300,000/= (pages 141 and 142 of the appeal brief). In re-

examination he has stated the exact amount as Rs. 305,400/=.

Therefore, an aggregate of Rs. 505,400/= has to be deducted from

the 2nd bill. Then the amount due is Rs. 13,695,552/=. The Plaintiff

himself has admitted in evidence that he received an advance

payment of Rs. 1,299,997.02, at the time the contract was awarded

(page 141 of the appeal brief). This amount has to be deducted and

then the amount due is Rs. 12,395,554.98.

SC/APPEAL/61/2018

In my view, the High Court did not analyse the evidence relating to P17

in its proper perspective. If I may reiterate, after making the strong

finding that the second bill was a sham, the High Court nevertheless

accepted the claim on the second bill solely on the basis that P17 contains

an unequivocal and unconditional admission by the defendant of bill

No. 2, referring to its amount as well. This constitutes a serious

misdirection of fact, which vitiates the judgment.

It is undisputed that the plaintiffs claim on the second bill is for a sum

of Rs. 14,000,952.00. However, P17 refers to bill No. 2 for a sum of Rs.

1,774,774.60, not Rs. 14,000,952.00 Thus, if at all, the defendant

admitted liability only for Rs. 1,774,774.60, not Rs. 14,000,952.00. The

claim in the second bill is significantly greater than the amount

mentioned in P17, which is over twelve million rupees. The High Court

gravely erred in fact when it stated that the defendant had admitted

payment of the full amount in the second bill by P17, referring to its

amount as well.

The next question is whether there is an unequivocal and unconditional

admission made by the defendant to pay Rs. 14,000,952.00 or Rs.

1,774,774.60 by P17. P17 reads as follows:

Dear Sir,

SC/APPEAL/61/2018

CONSTRUCTION OF THE APPLIED SCIENCE BUILDING FOR SUSL

This has reference to your bill No. 2 on the above construction for

Rs.1,774,774.60.

I regret to inform you that we are unable to settle the above bill due

to the financial constraints.

Since this matter has been referred to the Treasury and the

Authorities concerned we hope that we will get sum released from

the Treasury and once the money is received will be able to settle

the dues as soon as possible.

Sgd/T.K.W.T. Thalagune

Registrar

Copy: Bankers to the contractor

During cross-examination, the plaintiff was questioned about P17.

According to the plaintiff, P17 was issued by the Registrar of the

university at his request to present to the Bank in order to prevent the

Bank from taking action against the plaintiff for non-payment of dues. In

other words, it has been given for a different reason. Although P17 states,

Copy: Bankers to the Contractor, it lacks clarity. The plaintiff in the

evidence-in-chief stated that a copy of this letter was not sent to the Bank

by the university, but that he personally presented it to the Bank. The

letter has no reference number. It is undated. The sum mentioned in the

letter is an arbitrary sum, not based on the second bill, or any other bill

or document. The plaintiffs evidence on P17 makes this position clear:

: .17 ? (.17 )

The High Court did not consider this evidence at all which explains the

true nature of P17. I accept that if the defendant had unconditionally

accepted the full amount in the second bill by P17, the plaintiff would be

entitled to recover that sum from the defendant without further proof.

However, there is no unequivocal admission made by the defendant to

pay Rs. 14,000,952.00 or Rs. 1,774,774.60 to the plaintiff by P17. This

was the sole ground on which the High Court set aside the judgment of

the District Court and allowed the appeal of the plaintiff.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff sought to argue that P17 was not marked

subject to proof and therefore it cannot be given a different

interpretation at a later stage. P17 was marked from the proper custody.

7

SC/APPEAL/61/2018

There is no question about the authenticity of the document. The

defendant does not deny the issuance of P17, but the defendants position

is that it was issued for a different purpose. The defendant or this Court

does not intend to give a different interpretation to P17. It was the High

Court which gave a different interpretation to it.

On the other hand, merely because a document was marked without any

objection does not mean that the Court must accept it for all intents and

purposes. If Courts are to adopt such an approach, it would encourage

the prevailing unhealthy practice of some lawyers moving to mark every

document subject to proof as a routine. Similarly, merely because a

document is marked subject to proof does not mean that it cannot be

regarded as evidence unless it is proved by calling witnesses. For

instance, when a document is marked by the author himself, and the

opposite party moves to have it marked subject to proof, there is no need

to call witnesses to prove it. Whether or not a document is admissible in

evidence, and the extent of its admissibility, should not depend on

whether it was marked subject to proof. It should be decided at the

conclusion of the trial, taking into account all the facts and

circumstances of the case. I discussed this matter in Sanjeewa Fernando

v. Somawathie Perera (SC/APPEAL/1/2025, SC Minutes of 10.02.2025).

Leave to appeal in this case was granted on several questions of law and

the first of which is whether the High Court of Civil Appeal erred in law

by granting a sum of Rs. 12,395,554.98 based on the second bill. I

answer this question in the affirmative. As such, there is no need to

address the other questions of law. The judgment of the High Court

cannot be allowed to stand.

I set aside the judgment of the High Court dated 02.06.2016 and restore

the judgment of the District Court dated 03.06.2015 and allow the

appeal. Let the parties bear their own costs.
