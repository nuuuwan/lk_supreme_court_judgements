"Registrar"
"Copy: Bankers to the contractor"
"During  cross-examination, 
the  plaintiff  was  questioned  about  P17."
"According  to  the  plaintiff,  P17  was 
issued  by  the  Registrar  of  the"
"university at his request to present to the Bank in order to prevent the"
"Bank from taking action against the plaintiff for non-payment of dues. In"
"other words, it has been given for a different reason. Although P17 states,"
"“Copy:  Bankers  to  the  Contractor”,  it  lacks  clarity.  The  plaintiff  in  the"
"evidence-in-chief stated that a copy of this letter was not sent to the Bank"
"by the university, but that he personally presented it to the Bank.  The"
"letter has no reference number. It is undated. The sum mentioned in the"
"letter is an arbitrary sum, not based on the second bill, or any other bill"
"or document. The plaintiff’s evidence on P17 makes this position clear:"
