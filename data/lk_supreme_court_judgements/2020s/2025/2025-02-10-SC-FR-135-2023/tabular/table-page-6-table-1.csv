SC/FR/135/2023"
"The  petitioner  promptly  responded  to  this  notice  by  a 
letter  dated"
"04.05.2023 addressed to the 2nd respondent requesting “the grounds for"
"rejection”  of  its  bid  and  “a  debriefing”  in  terms  of  Clause  39.2  of  the"
"Instructions to Bidders contained in the Bidding Document marked P3."
"This letter written in amicable terms was tendered as P10. In reply, the"
"2nd  respondent  by  letter  dated  12.05.2023  marked  R5,  informed  the"
"petitioner that the details regarding the debriefing on the rejection of the"
"petitioner’s bid had already been communicated to the Secretary of the"
"Line Ministry who is the Chief Accounting Officer, and that the Secretary"
"would convey the reasons to the petitioner."
"The petitioner later changed its mind and wrote P11 dated 08.05.2023 to"
"the  same  2nd  respondent  in  a  hostile  tone.  In  this  letter,  the  petitioner"
"referred to paragraph 5 of the Notice of Award marked P9, which stated,"
"“All  appeals  should  be  submitted  on  or  before  12th  May  2023”,  and"
"requested  “strictly  without  prejudice”  that  P11  be  treated  as  its  formal"
"appeal against the rejection of its bid and the awarding of the tender to"
"another party."
"Before responding to P10 and P11, the petitioner filed this fundamental"
"rights application dated 09.05.2023 on 10.05.2023. The gravamen of the"
"complaint  of  the  petitioner  is  that  although  “its  bid  was  substantially"
"responsive in respect of all the criteria set out in the bidding documents,"
"and the bid price it offered was substantially lower than that of the 4th"
"respondent”, awarding the tender to the 4th respondent is violative of its"
"fundamental  rights  enshrined 
in  Articles  12(1)  and  14(1)(g)  of 
the"
"Constitution. In addition to the formal declarations, in the prayer to the"
"petition, the petitioner seeks as substantive reliefs directions on the 1st"
"respondent or any other respondent to accept the petitioner’s bid as the"
"substantially responsive and financially lowest bid and award the tender"
"to the petitioner."
