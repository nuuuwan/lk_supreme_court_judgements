"bids, which directly relates to substantial justice. Therefore, as there has"
"been  no  compromise  on  substantial  justice,  I  am  not  inclined  to  place"
"significant  weight  on  procedural 
irregularities,  particularly  as  no"
"prejudice  has  been  caused  to  the  petitioner,  as  evidenced  by  P10  and"
"P11."
"The petitioner contends that failure to give reasons is violative of the right"
"to  equal  protection  of  the  law  guaranteed  under  Article  12(1)  of  the"
"Constitution."

"as afterthoughts. The rationale is that reasons must precede the decision,"
"not follow it. In other words, the decision-maker should not arrive at a"
"decision based on extraneous factors first and then somehow attempt to"
"justify it by contriving reasons."

"Silva J. (as he then was) approved the tendering of reasons to the Court,"
"with  notice  to  the  petitioner,  when  a  judicial  review  of  the  order  is"
