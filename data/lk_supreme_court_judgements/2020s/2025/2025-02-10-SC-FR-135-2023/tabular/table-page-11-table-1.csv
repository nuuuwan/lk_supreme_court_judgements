"in exercising its writ or fundamental rights jurisdiction, this Court must"
"exercise  caution 
in  revisiting  decisions  that  are  highly  technical 
in"
"nature.  This 
restraint 
is  necessitated  by 
the  Courtâ€™s 
institutional"
"limitations."
"If the petitioner truly wishes to challenge the findings of those reports,"
"the petitioner would have to go before a different forum, and this cannot"
"practically be done within the context of a fundamental rights application"
"decided  on  limited  pleadings  without  oral  evidence,  and  meant  to  be"
"concluded within two months of its filing, as stipulated by Article 126(5)"
"of the Constitution. Those are statutory limitations."
"I am aware that the contours of the applicability of Article 12(1), the right"
"to  equality,  have  expanded  significantly  over  the  years  to  encompass"
"virtually  any  violation  under  its  purview.  However,  every  procedural  or"
"substantive  error  does  not  and  cannot  attract  the  invocation  of  the"
"fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court."
"In Wijesinghe v. Attorney General and Others [1978-79-80] 1 Sri LR 102,"
"the petitioner contended that her termination from service as a sub-post"
"mistress was effected without any charges being brought against her and"
"without being afforded an opportunity to be heard, thereby violating the"
"equal protection and non-discrimination guarantees under Articles 12(1)"
"and 12(2) of the Constitution. The Supreme Court, while recognizing that"
"the  petitioner  may  have  suffered  an 
injustice,  held  that 
it  did  not"
"constitute a violation of a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 12 of"
"the Constitution. Wanasundera J. at pages 105-106, quoting, inter alia,"
"Siddappa  v.  State  of  Mysore  &  Another  AIR  1967  (Mysore)  67,  Budhan"
