"liquidation  of  the  said  Gal  Oya  Valley  Multipurpose  Co-operative  Societies"
"Union Ltd, the appellant cannot claim any right to the said portion of land"
"unless it had obtained a new lease or an annual permit according to the law,"
"which the appellant has failed to obtain."
"Since  it  is  a  land  belonging  to  the  State  for  which  the  authority  to  issue  a"
"permit lies with the relevant Government Agent or the Divisional Secretary for"
"that matter, it is my considered view that the appellant has no status quo to"
"object as to the manner such a permit should be issued."
"Although the initial permit issued to the 5th respondent has been for an extent"
"of 17.6 perches only, having considered the location of the entire 24 perches"
"of land and the impracticability of allocating the balance portion of the same"
"to  another  party,  it  appears  that  the  2nd  respondent,  being  the  Divisional"
"Secretary of Ampara, has recommended that the entire piece of land should"
"be given on a permit to the 5th respondent, which I find the most appropriate"
"decision in relation to the land under dispute."
"Hence,  I  find  nothing  surreptitious  in  the  recommendation  made  by  the"
"Divisional Secretary of Ampara, which has been communicated to the relevant"
"Subject Minister by the letter marked P-17 (page 272 of the brief)."
"For  the  reasons  as  considered  above,  I  find  no  basis  to  disagree  with  the"
"judgment  pronounced  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Case  No.  2084/2004  on"
"31.05.2016, where the Writ Application filed by the appellant was dismissed"
"with costs."
"In  view  of  the  above  findings,  I  answer  the  questions  of  law  set  out  in"
"paragraph 7(a), (d) and (e) in the negative."
"In view of the answers provided as earlier, I am of the view that considering"
"the question of law set out in paragraph 7(b) would not be necessary for the"
"purpose of determining this appeal."
