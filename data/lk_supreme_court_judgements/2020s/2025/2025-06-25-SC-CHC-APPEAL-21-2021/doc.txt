Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff bank instituted this action against the defendant in the

Commercial High Court in 2012 seeking to recover term loan facilities

granted to the defendant in the nature of Trust Receipts for Goods for

Exportation, as reflected in Trust Receipts marked P3, P7, and P11. The

defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiff’s action. It must be

noted that the defendant did not raise any specific defence in the answer.

At the trial, inter alia, the following two admissions were recorded:

4. පැමිණිල්ල සමග පැ3, පැ7 සහ පැ11 වශයෙන් ලකුණු කර ඉදිරිපත් කර ඇති අපනෙන

බව පමණක් පිලිගනී.

The defendant did not reply to the Letter of Demand.

At the trial, several witnesses testified on behalf of the plaintiff, and

documents marked P1 to P16 were produced in evidence. At the close of the

plaintiff’s case, no objection was raised regarding the proper proof of those

documents.

On behalf of the defendant, no witnesses were called, nor were any

documents marked.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge delivered

judgment in favour of the plaintiff bank, permitting it to recover the

principal sum together with interest at 8% from the defendant.

The defendant appealed to this Court.

3 SC/CHC/APPEAL/21/2021

At the hearing of the appeal, the sole ground urged by the learned

President’s Counsel for the defendant was that the learned High Court

Judge had erred in the calculation of the interest component.

In the plaint, the plaintiff bank stated that it was entitled to recover interest

at the rate of LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum. However, in the Trust Receipts

marked P3, P7 and P11, clauses 1 and 3 expressly provide that the

defendant agreed to pay “8% above today’s current 3 months LIBOR rate”

as interest, along with 1% penal interest. I note that the plaintiff did not

satisfactorily explain the LIBOR rate at the trial. Nevertheless, as clearly

stipulated in P3, P7 and P11, the defendant undertook to pay interest at

“8% above today’s current 3 months LIBOR rate” together with 1% penal

interest on the capital sum. This means the plaintiff was contractually

entitled to recover 8% above the LIBOR rate in addition to penal interest.

However, the learned High Court Judge disregarded the LIBOR rate and

allowed the plaintiff to recover only 8% interest on the capital, without even

awarding the 1% penal interest. In view of, particularly, the fourth

admission recorded at the trial—where the defendant admitted to obtaining

loan facilities subject to the terms and conditions set out in P3, P7 and

P11—I am of the view that the calculation adopted by the learned High

Court Judge was fair.

Although the defendant did not dispute the principal sums borrowed and

only contested the interest recoverable, the principal sums have remained

unpaid for over 15 years.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the appeal. The plaintiff bank shall be

entitled to recover the taxed costs in this Court and the Court below.

In the connected appeal (SC/CHC/APPEAL/19/2021), the defendants are

the guarantors. As agreed before this Court, the parties to that appeal shall

be bound by this judgment.
