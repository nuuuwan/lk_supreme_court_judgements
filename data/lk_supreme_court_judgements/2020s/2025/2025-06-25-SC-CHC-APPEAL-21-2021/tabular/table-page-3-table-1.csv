 SC/CHC/APPEAL/21/2021"
"At  the  hearing  of  the  appeal,  the  sole  ground  urged  by  the 
learned"
"President’s  Counsel  for  the  defendant  was  that  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge had erred in the calculation of the interest component."
"In the plaint, the plaintiff bank stated that it was entitled to recover interest"
"at the rate of LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum. However, in the Trust Receipts"
"marked  P3,  P7  and  P11,  clauses  1  and  3  expressly  provide  that  the"
"defendant agreed to pay “8% above today’s current 3 months LIBOR rate”"
"as interest, along with 1% penal interest. I note that the plaintiff did  not"
"satisfactorily  explain  the  LIBOR  rate  at  the  trial.  Nevertheless,  as  clearly"
"stipulated in P3, P7 and P11, the defendant undertook to pay interest at"
"“8% above today’s current 3 months LIBOR rate” together with 1% penal"
"interest  on  the  capital  sum.  This  means  the  plaintiff  was  contractually"
"entitled to recover 8% above the LIBOR rate in addition to penal interest."
"However,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  disregarded  the  LIBOR  rate  and"
"allowed the plaintiff to recover only 8% interest on the capital, without even"
"awarding 
the  1%  penal 
interest. 
In  view  of,  particularly, 
the 
fourth"
"admission recorded at the trial—where the defendant admitted to obtaining"
"loan  facilities  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  set  out  in  P3,  P7  and"
"P11—I  am  of  the  view  that  the  calculation  adopted  by  the  learned  High"
"Court Judge was fair."
"Although the defendant did not dispute the principal sums borrowed and"
"only contested the interest recoverable, the principal sums have remained"
"unpaid for over 15 years."
"For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the appeal. The plaintiff bank shall be"
"entitled to recover the taxed costs in this Court and the Court below."
"In the connected appeal (SC/CHC/APPEAL/19/2021), the defendants are"
"the guarantors. As agreed before this Court, the parties to that appeal shall"
"be bound by this judgment."
