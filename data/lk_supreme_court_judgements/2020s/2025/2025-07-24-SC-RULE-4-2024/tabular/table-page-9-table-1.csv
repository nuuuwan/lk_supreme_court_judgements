"22.","The Respondent in his evidence claimed that he operated as a middleman in relation to"
"","the  sale  of  apportioned  plots  from  the  abovementioned  estate  and  that  he  acted  on"
"","behalf of and according to the instructions given by one Gunapala."
"23.","The  Respondent  claimed  that  the  monies  he  received  from  the  Complainant  were"
"","accepted  and  deposited  into  an  account  on  behalf  of  said  Gunapala.  Upon  being"
"","questioned by this Court, the Respondent conceded that monies were deposited into his"
"","personal account. When this Court inquired whether he maintained trust accounts for his"
"","clients, the Respondent claimed that he never maintained such accounts."
"24.","Regarding the fees he obtained from the Virtual Complainant for the preparation of a"
"","deed of transfer, it was admitted by the Respondent that he neither prepared a deed for"
"","the said Complaint nor returned the fees obtained for that purpose."
"25.","The Respondent further disputed the fact that he ever entered into an agreement to sell"
"","Lot 95 to the Virtual Complainant. It was his position that the Virtual Complainant visited"
"","his office on a random day and made a payment, which the Complainant claimed to be"
"","for  Lot  95.  Relying  on  the  Complainant’s  word,  without  doing  any  due  diligence,  the"
"","Respondent had noted down Lot 95 in the invoice marked “A5”. He claims that there is"
"","no fault on his part as he placed full confidence in what the Virtual Complainant said."
"26.","I  am  somewhat  reluctantly  inclined  to  note  the  irony  of  this  defence,  having  earlier"
"","attempted to find fault with the Complainant for not doing due diligence with respect to"
"","the ownership of the land."
