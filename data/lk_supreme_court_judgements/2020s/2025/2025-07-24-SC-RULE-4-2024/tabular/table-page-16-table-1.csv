"48.  Having heard and observed the witnesses, and especially considering the consistency of",""
"","testimonies and available documentary evidence, I am inclined to place more reliance on"
"","the evidence submitted by the Virtual Complainant."
"49.","The  agreement  between  the  Respondent  and  the  Complainant  for  the  sale  of  Lot  95,"
"","pursuant  to  which  the  Complainant  had  paid  Rs.  62,500/-  to  the  Respondent,  is  very"
"","clearly  established  by  the  evidence  before  this  Court.  Considering  the  totality  of  the"
"","evidence, I am also inclined to accept the Complainant’s allegation that the Respondent"
"","held himself out to be the owner of the land."
"50.","By the conduct aforementioned, the Respondent Attorney-at-Law has acted fraudulently"
"","and deceitfully towards the Virtual Complainant."
"","Misappropriation of Funds & the Failure to Maintain Trust Accounts"
"51.","It is also clearly established that the Respondent had taken Rs. 62,500/- pursuant to the"
"","agreement to sell Lot 95 to the Complainant, which he failed to honour. In addition to"
"","this, he has also obtained a sum of Rs. 3,500/- to prepare a deed of transfer, which the"
"","Complainant has not received to date, well over two decades later."
"52.","It is also apparent from Deed No. 296 dated 13th November 2012, marked “A8”, prepared"
"","by the Respondent himself, that the said Lot 95 has now been transferred to a third party."
"","Furthermore, the Respondent has not taken any steps to return the money he obtained"
"","for  the  above  purpose.  He  provided  various  excuses  as  to  why  he  did  not  attempt  to"
"","return the money."
"53.","If the Respondent was acting as an agent of the owner or as a middleman between the"
"","Complainant and any agent of the owner, he ought to have transferred the money so"
"","obtained to the owner or such agent, for the Respondent would have been holding the"
"","same in trust."
