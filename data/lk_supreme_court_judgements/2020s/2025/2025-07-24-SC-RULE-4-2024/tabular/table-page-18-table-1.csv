"attorney  or  his  firm  and  entries  with  regard  to  them  should  be  separately"
"recorded. There must be no ‘commingling’. Commingling of funds takes place when"
"a client’s money is intermingled with that of his attorney and its separate identity"
"lost so that it may be used for the attorney’s personal expenses or be subjected to the"
"claims of his creditors. Commingling is prohibited to provide against the probability"
"in  some  cases,  the  possibility in  many  cases,  and  the  danger  in  all  case  that  such"
"commingling will result in the loss of client’s money. [Black v. State Bar, 57 Cal. 2d"
