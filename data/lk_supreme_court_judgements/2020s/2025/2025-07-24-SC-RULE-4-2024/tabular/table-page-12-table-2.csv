"for it is an aspect generally misunderstood by most."
"In this regard, Amerasinghe J, in Daniel v. Chandradeva,9 observed as follows:"
"“…Where  the  conduct  of  an  attorney  is  in  question  in  disciplinary  proceedings,  it"
"requires as a matter of common sense and worldly wisdom the careful weighing of"
"testimony,  the  close  examination  of  facts  proved  as  a  basis  of  inference  and  a"
"comfortable  satisfaction  that  a  just  and  correct  decision  has  been  reached.  The"
"importance and gravity of asking an attorney to show cause makes it impossible for"
"the Court to be satisfied of the truth of an allegation without the exercise of caution"
"and unless the proofs survive a careful scrutiny. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is"
"not  necessary,  but  something  more  than  a  balancing  of  the  scales  is  necessary  to"
"enable the Court to have the desired feeling of comfortable satisfaction. A very high"
"standard of proof is required where there are allegations involving a suggestion of"
"criminality, deceit or moral turpitude…”"
