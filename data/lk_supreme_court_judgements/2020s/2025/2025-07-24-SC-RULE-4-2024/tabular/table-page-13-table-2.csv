"Mahes Moonesinghe,12 where an attorney was struck off the Roll for deceit, even in the"
"absence of a criminal prosecution. Amerasinghe J observed in this case as follows:"
"â€œConviction  for  an  offence  is  only  a  prima  facie  reason  why  this  Court  kay  act  in"
"matters of this kind. An attorney whose misconduct is criminal in character, whether"
"it  was  done  in  pursuit  of  his  profession  or  not,  (this  Court  has  wider  powers  than"
"those affirmed by section 4 of the Penal Code), may be struck off the roll, suspended"
"from practice, reprimanded, admonished or advised, even though he had not been"
"brought  by  the  appropriate  legal  process  before  a  court  of  competent  criminal"
