"","THE RESPONDENT’S DEFENCE"
"18.  During the cross-examination of the Virtual Complainant, the Counsel appearing for the",""
"","Respondent made several suggestions to the witness, essentially alluding that the Virtual"
"","Complainant  had  been  somewhat  imprudent  in  the  course  of  his  dealings  with  the"
"","Respondent."
"19.  During the cross-examination of the Virtual Complainant as well as the examination-in-",""
"","chief  of  the  Respondent  Attorney-at-Law,  referring  to  the  invoice  marked  “A1”,  the"
"","Counsel  for  the  Respondent  highlighted  a  condition  set  out  therein  empowering  the"
"","owner of the land to sell it to whomever in the event the full purchase price is not paid."
"","Repeated references were made to the fact that the purchase price was mentioned in the"
"","said invoice to be Rs. 125,000/-, despite the Virtual Complainant clearly explaining that"
"","the agreement was altered subsequently to purchase half an acre instead of an acre as"
"","originally intended. This variation to the original agreement is clearly recorded in writing"
"","at the back of said invoice, and the Respondent, too, conceded to this when inquired.4"
"20.","The learned Counsel further attempted to suggest that the Virtual Complainant had been"
"","imprudent, highlighting his failure to perform due diligence as well as the failure to file"
"","civil action vindicating his title and/or for breach of contract against the Respondent. It"
"","was suggested that the Complainant did not so vindicate his rights as he was aware of"
"","his defective title."
"21.","It was  also  highlighted repeatedly that the  invoices issued  by the  Respondent did not"
"","mention  his  name—or  any  other’s  name  for  that  matter—as  the  owner  of  the  land"
"","Poorana Estate."
