"","12.  The  Virtual  Complainant  claims  that  he  completed  the  full  payment  by  25th  February"
"","2006, and at that point, the Respondent Attorney-at-Law had taken Rs. 3,500/- to prepare"
"","a deed of transfer. At the time of completing this payment, the Virtual Complainant had"
"","already taken possession of and cultivated the plot in question."
"13.  While he was so in possession, in or around 2018, another party by the name of Linton",""
"","had  come  to  clear  out  the  adjacent  land  plot.  Sometime  later,  the  said  Linton  had"
"","informed that he also owns the aforementioned Lot 95, which included the portion that"
"","the Virtual Complainant purchased from the Respondent, and shown a deed as proof of"
"","ownership."
"14.","This Deed No. 296, dated 13th November 2012, along with the plan appurtenant thereto,"
"","has  been  produced  before  this  Court  marked  “A8(1)”.  This  Deed,  which  effects  a"
"","conveyance of several lots including Lot 95 in favour  of said Linton, evinces  beyond  a"
"","shadow of doubt that the same was prepared by the Respondent Attorney-at-Law."
"15.  Upon informing of the same to the Respondent, he had informed the Complainant that",""
"","the  owner  resides  abroad,  and  had  asked  him  not  to  panic,  promising  to  prepare  the"
"","deed as soon as the owner comes back. The Complainant claims to have visited and/or"
"","inquired from the Respondent numerous times as to the delay in preparing the deed."
"16.","Thereafter, following persistent inquiries, the Respondent had admitted that there had"
"","been a mistake and had undertaken to discuss with Linton and prepare the Complainant’s"
"","deed as previously promised. The Respondent has failed to stay true to this undertaking"
"","to date."
"17.","The  Complainant  further  testified  that  said  Linton  has  since  resold  the  land  to  one"
"","Karunadasa, who has been taking steps to evict the Complainant from the land, leaving"
"","the Respondent utterly helpless as he has no deed to his name."
