"58.","I must emphasise that keeping proper records of monies and other properties entrusted"
"","to an attorney by a client is not a mere nicety or a matter of convenience: It is an absolute"
"","bare minimum requirement expected of every attorney, irrespective of how experienced"
"","or inexperienced they might be."
"59.","As  Bertram  CJ  emphasised  in  The  Matter  of  an  Application  of  a  Proctor  to  be  Re-"
"","admitted and Re-enrolled as a Proctor of the Supreme Court,18 “…[t]here is no principle"
"","which it is more important to press upon persons entering the legal profession than a strict"
"","regard to the principles of trust accounts…”"
"60.","The subject of Ethics and Trust Accounts is  one often neglected by students, for most"
"","consider it a burden rather than an opportunity to learn an essential skill in the practice"
"","of  law.  It  is  also  concerning  how  most  law  students  today  have  fallen  victim  to  the"
"","outcome-based/results-oriented  education  culture  surrounding  such  subjects—a  sin"
"","most commonly perpetuated by the profiteers of so-called ‘legal’ education. While I see"
"","no need to say any more of it, I sincerely hope that this Rule, as well as many other similar"
"","proceedings before this Court, serve as a wake-up call to those prudent students of the"
"","law, compelling them to concern themselves  as much with acquiring essential skills as"
"","with the letter grades that may appear on their final transcripts."
"61.","It is amply clear that the Respondent Attorney-at-Law, having obtained monies from the"
"","Complainant for a specific purpose, has failed to carry out that purpose. He has failed in"
"","his duties to diligently handle monies entrusted to him by the Complainant and to keep"
"","proper records in this regard."
"62.","Considering the totality of the evidence I have adverted to above, I take the view that"
"","sufficient material is available to establish for the comfortable satisfaction of this Court"
