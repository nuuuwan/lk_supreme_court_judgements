"65.","The Respondent in the instant matter was admitted to the Bar on 31st March 1988. He"
"","has  over  thirty-seven  years  in  the  legal  practice.  Following  his  failure  to  provide  the"
"","services as promised, he has not taken any steps to repay the monies obtained from the"
"","Complainant 
for 
that  purpose.  Most 
importantly, 
throughout  his 
testimony, 
the"
"","Respondent displayed not an ounce of accountability or remorse."
"66.","Additionally,  he  completely  disregarded  several  notices  of  this  Court  and  completely"
"","failed to file his observations in time. If an attorney does not file documentation in time"
"","and act diligently with respect to his own disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme"
"","Court, one cannot expect him to be prudent when it comes to the affairs of his clients."
"","The  nobility  of  the  profession,  as  well  as  the  best  interest  of  society,  demand  stern"
"","disciplinary action against such persons."
"67.","The Counsel for the Respondent invited this  Court to consider his age and frailty as  a"
"","mitigatory factor. However, the Respondent has taken the monies from the Complainant"
"","between 2003 and 2006—almost over twenty years ago—and the Deed No. 296, marked"
"","“A8(1)”,  is  dated  13th  November  2012—well  over  a  decade  ago.  Therefore,  I  am  not"
"","inclined to show any leniency based on his advanced age and frailty."
