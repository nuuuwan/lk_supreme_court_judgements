"","previously  noted,  the  document  marked  “A5”  clearly  contains  evidence  of  such  an"
"","agreement.  The  Respondent’s  explanation  is  that  he  mentioned  ‘Lot  95’  in  the  said"
"","invoice marked “A5” merely because the Complainant said so."
"44.  What the Respondent Attorney-at-Law has conceived as a defence here, in my view, is",""
"","worse than the offence. If it is to be believed, he has, as an Attorney-at-Law, written down"
"","what was dictated by a client and placed his stamp and signature underneath, without"
"","giving a second thought as to the veracity of such dictation."
"45.","In addition to this, the Complainant very clearly testified that the Respondent presented"
"","himself as the owner of the land. But the Respondent vehemently denied ever carrying"
"","himself as the owner. It was highlighted throughout his evidence that the documentation"
"","provided to the Complainant did not mention the Respondent as the owner of the land."
"","However, it must be observed that said documentation bears no information as to the"
"","ownership of the property. Most such documents merely confirm the receipt of certain"
"","amounts 
from 
the  Complainant.  The  document  marked  “A1”,  however,  contains"
"","evidence of the initial agreement between the Respondent and the Complainant as well"
"","as the subsequent variation thereto, whereas “A5” makes reference to Lot 95."
"46.  While it may be true that the Virtual Complainant could have verified the ownership of",""
"","the  land  and/or  taken  civil  action,  his  failure  to  act  diligently  does  not  absolve  the"
"","Respondent from his duties as an Attorney-at-Law and Notary Public."
"47.","The evidence on behalf of the Virtual Complainant has been consistent throughout, from"
"","the initial Complaint itself to his testimony before this Court. The Respondent, in my view,"
"","appeared far from consistent or credible. While the nature of proceedings such as this,"
"","being a disciplinary inquiry, is fundamentally different to that of a civil or criminal trial,"
"","the test of consistency remains ever so relevant in assessing the veracity of evidence."
