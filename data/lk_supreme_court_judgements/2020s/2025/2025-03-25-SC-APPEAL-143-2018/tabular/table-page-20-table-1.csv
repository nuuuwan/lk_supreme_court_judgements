"contributory  negligence  and 
the  given  section  does  not  apply 
to  a"
"dependent  of  a  party  that  contributes  to  the  negligence,  who  file  a  case"
"on  a  cause  of  action 
that  has  caused  pecuniary 
loss 
to 
the  said"
"dependent. Thus, when a dependent of a party to contributory negligence"
"filed  a  case  as  a  Plaintiff  and  one  has  to  look  at  our  common  law,"
"Roman-Dutch  Law,  to  see  whether  compensation  has  to be apportioned"
"or reduced in accordance with the contribution for the negligence caused"
"made by the negligent party to whom the dependent is related."
"It must be noted, when the dependents filed an action against a party to"
"the  contributory  negligence,  they  filed  it  based  on  a  cause  of  action"
"accrued  to  them  due  to  the  pecuniary  loss  caused  to  them  by  said"
"negligence. 
It  must  be  differentiated 
from  a 
situation  where 
the"
"dependents are substituted as plaintiffs to a party deceased who was the"
"plaintiff  originally.  On  said  occasions,  they  step  into  the  shoes  of  the"
"original  plaintiff  who  is  a  party  to  the  contributory negligence. The case"
"at  hand  is  not  a  case  where  the  plaintiffs  have  been substituted for the"
"original plaintiffs who was a party to contributory negligence. In contrast,"
"the  present  case  at  hand  has  been  filed  by  the  dependents  of a person,"
"who  is  deceased  due  to  an  accident  caused  by  the  negligence  of  the"
"Defendant,  for  the  pecuniary  loss  caused  to  them.  The  deceased  might"
"have been a party to the contributory negligence but the dependents are"
"not  making  claims  for  a  cause  of  action  accrued  to  the  deceased  but"
"directly to them."
