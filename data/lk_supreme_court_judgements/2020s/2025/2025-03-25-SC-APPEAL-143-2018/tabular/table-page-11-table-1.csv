"usually  go  across  the  road,  or  at least a reasonable prudent man would"
"expect that a person would go across the road and not drive at excessive"
"speed."
"U
pon  perusal  of  the  record  of  the  cross  examination  of the Appellant in"
"the  District  court,  when  questioned  on  what  speed  the  Appellant  was"
"traveling  at  the  time  of  the  accident,  the  Appellant  answered  he  was"
"traveling  at  a  speed  of  40  kilometers  per  hour  (at page 154 of the brief)."
"However, as per the document marked P12 which is the Police statement"
"taken  from  the  Appellant,  a  few  hours  after  the  accident,  the  Appellant"
"stated  that  he  was  traveling  at  a  speed  of  50  to  55  kilometers  per hour"
"(at  page  155  of 
the  brief).  The  Appellant  during  cross  examination"
"concedes to the fact that he could have been traveling at the speed of 50"
"to 55 kilometers. In P12, the Appellant had further stated that one of the"
"front  tires of the vehicle had burst, owing to which he lost control of the"
"vehicle,  leading  to  the  accident.   However,  as  per  the  evidence  of  the"
"Government Analyst at page 110 of the brief, the tyre had burst after the"
"accident  had  occurred  and  not  before.  Further,  during 
the  cross"
"examination  of  the Appellant,the Appellant admitted that the vehicle did"
"not  come  to  a  halt  after  hitting  the  deceased  but  continued  on  and  hit"
"the  pavement,  which  led  to  the  tyre  to  burst  (at  pages  161-162  of  the"
"brief).  Therefore,  when  all  these 
factors  are  considered  in  total  it  is"
"obvious  that  the  Appellant  was  in  fact  traveling  at  an  excessive  speed"
"and a breach of duty of care has occurred."
"T
he  next  element  is  causation,  which  is  the  but-for  test,  in  considering"
"the facts above, if not for the negligent driving and excessive speed of the"
"Appellant, the accident would not have occurred. There is a direct nexus"
