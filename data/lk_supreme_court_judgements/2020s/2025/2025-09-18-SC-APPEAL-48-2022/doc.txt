K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J.

The Petitioners Appellants filed a Writ Application before the Court of Appeal, bearing No.

276/2021, which was with regard to a school application, dated 17th May 2021. On the 10th day of

December 2021, the Court of Appeal, having duly considered the submissions of the parties,

delivered its judgment dismissing the application of the PetitionersAppellants.

5

Aggrieved by which the Petitioners - Appellants came before this Court where Special Leave to

Appeal was granted on the following questions of law raised in paragraph 66 (b), (c) and (h) of the

Petition.

1. Did the Court of Appeal fail to take cognisance of the fact that the annotation made by the

6th Respondent - Respondent is not the collective decision of the Interview Board?

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to appreciate that the conduct of the 6th

Respondent - Respondent was in breach of the Rules of Natural Justice?

3. Did the Court of Appeal fall into substantial error by failing to appreciate the Respondent

- Respondents interpretation of the Circular was perfunctory?

As stated in the petition, the 1st Petitioner - Appellant, a minor born on the 22nd of August 2015,

was 5 years and 9 months old at the time of filing the application. The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant,

his father, is a police inspector attached to the Galle Police Headquarters and serves as the Officer

in Charge of Logistics. The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant sought appointment as the 1st Petitioner -

Appellants next friend, asserting his eligibility and lack of conflicting interests in representing the

minor.

The 1st Respondent - Respondent was the former Principal of Richmond College and chaired the

Interview Board responsible for admissions. The 2nd Respondent - Respondent served as the

Secretary of the Board, while the 3rd to 5th Respondents - Respondents were its members. The 6th

Respondent - Respondent was the current Principal at the time of filing, with the successors

subsequently added as the 6A Respondent - Respondent and thereafter as 6B Respondent -

Respondent. Additionally, the Appeals and Objections Investigations Board included the 7th

Respondent - Respondent as Chairman, the 8th Respondent - Respondents as Secretary, and the 9th

to 11th Respondents - Respondents as members. The 12th Respondent - Respondent was the

Secretary to the Ministry of Education, and the 13th Respondent - Respondent was the Director of

National Schools of the said Ministry.

The Petitioners - Appellants highlighted the Directive Principles of State Policy under Article

27(2) (h) of the Constitution, which ensures universal and equal access to education. The statutory

framework for general education is governed by the Education Ordinance No. 31 of 1939, as

6

amended, which empowers the Minister of Education to regulate school admissions. Furthermore,

the National Education Commission Act No. 19 of 1991 allows the President, based on

recommendations from the National Education Commission, to establish policies, including

criteria for student admissions.

The Petitioner - Appellants seeks to uphold these principles and statutory provisions, asserting that

the 1st Petitioner - Appellants right to education was unjustly denied due to improper decisions

made during the admission process.

The Ministry of Education, through Circular No. 29/2019 dated 24th May 2019, established

guidelines for admissions to Grade 1 from 2020 onward. Amendments to this circular were

introduced via Circulars No. 29/2019 (1) dated 11th July 2019 and No. 16/2020 dated 26th May

2020. These amendments addressed aspects such as measuring the distance between the residence

and the school by straight-line distance. The circulars also defined the allocation of admissions

among six categories.

According to Clause 7.0 of P1, the total number of students admitted to National Schools is

distributed among the various categories in the following proportions:

Category of students Percentage allocated

(i) Children of residents in close proximity to the school 50%

(ii) Children of parents who are past pupils 25%

(iii) Brothers/sisters of student already in the school 15%

(iv) Children of those on the staff of the institutions

directly involved in public school education under the Ministry of

Education

05%

(v) Children of officers in Government/Corporation/ Statutory

Board/ State Bank services on transfer on exigencies/ annual

transfer schemes

04%

7

(vi) Children of persons arriving after living abroad with the children 01%

As mentioned in the petition, the 2nd PetitionerAppellant, an Inspector of Police, was transferred

from Tangalle Division to Galle Division on 10th of February 2020 due to service exigencies, was

eligible to apply for his son (the 1st Petitioner - Appellant) under Category 5 of the admission

guidelines. Due to his transfer, the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant leased an apartment near Richmond

College. Although this apartment initially lacked separate utilities and an assessment number,

arrangements were made to provide temporary connections, enabling the Petitioners - Appellants

to prove residence near the school.

Clause 7.6 of P1 clearly outlines the eligibility criteria for applicants classified under the category

of Children of officers in Government/Corporation/ Statutory Board/

State Bank services on transfer on exigencies/ annual transfer schemes. The admission criteria

for applicants in this category include multiple factors such as:

I. Distance between the officers previous place of work and the new location of transfer

(measured along the shortest route with available public transport):

150 km or more 35 marks

100 km to less than 150 km 28 marks

50 km to less than 100 km 21 marks

25 km to less than 50 km 14 marks

(Maximum allocation: 35 marks)

II. Proximity to school: Maximum marks were awarded if no closer government school with

a primary section existed. For each closer school, three marks were deducted.

III. Service duration: Marks were awarded based on years of government service, capped at 10

marks.

IV. Previous service tenure: Service duration at the last station contributed up to 10 marks.

V. Time since transfer: A maximum of 5 marks were awarded for transfers within one year.

VI. Unused leave: Marks were granted for unutilized leave, with two marks for every 20

unused days in the five years preceding the application, up to 10 marks.

8

The 2nd PetitionerAppellant, being eligible under Clause 7.6, submitted an application on or about

the 25th of June 2020 to Richmond College, Galle, seeking admission for the 1st Petitioner

Appellant, along with the required supporting documents:

a) The 1st Petitioner - Appellant's birth certificate (marked as P5A and appears at pages 301

to 302).

b) Google map showing the distance from the residence to the school (550 meters by road and

305 meters aerially. The said map has been marked as P5B and appears at page 303).

c) Grama Niladhari's certificate dated 02/07/2020 confirming residence of the Petitioners -

Appellants (marked as P5C and appears at pages 304 to 305).

d) Letter issued by the Grama Niladhari and counter signed by the Divisional Secretary of

Kataragama confirming that the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant and his family were permanent

residents of the said grama sevaka division and that 2nd Petitioner - Appellant is no longer

serving in the said area (marked as P5D and appears at page 306).

e) Electoral registration details for 2018 and 2019 (marked as P5E and appears at pages 308

to 311).

f) Letters from police officials verifying the 2nd Petitioner - Appellants service history and

the nature of his transfer (marked as P5F and appears at page 312).

g) Copy of the Transfer Order dated 9.2.2020 issued by the Senior DIG Southern Province

(marked as P5G and appears at page 313).

h) Letter issued by the Senior Superintendent of Police, Galle confirming that the 2nd

Petitioner - Appellant was transferred on exigencies of service (marked as P5H and appears

at page 314).

i) Documentation from the Southern Provincial Transport Authority confirming the transfer

distance as 158 km (marked as P-5I and appears at page 315 to 316).

j) Letter of Appointment of the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant to the post of Sub-Inspector (marked

as P5J and appears at pages 317 to 318).

k) Letter issued by the Chief Inspector of the Kirinda Police Station confirming that the 2nd

Petitioner - Appellant was attached to the said station (marked as P5K and appears at page

319).

9

l) Verification from the Viharadhipathi of a pre-school attended by the 1st Petitioner -

Appellant in Kataragama (marked as P5L and appears at page 320).

m) A statement of unutilized leave certified by the Inspector of Police in Galle (marked as

P5M and appears at page 321).

As outlined in the petition, the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant complied with all requirements under the

guidelines and marking scheme for Category 5 admissions. The submitted documents collectively

substantiated his eligibility and justified the application for the 1st Petitioner - Appellants

admission to Richmond College. The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant received a letter from the 1st

Respondent - Respondent notifying him of his eligibility for his childs admission to Grade 1 at

Richmond College, Galle, for the year 2021. The letter instructed the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant to

attend an interview on 22nd October 2020 and informed him of a parents meeting scheduled for

22nd September 2020. The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant was assigned candidate number TR-038. The

letter also required the submission of specific documents, including proof of residency and official

documents for those applying under service transfer grounds.

In paragraph 22 of the Petition it is stated that the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant received the aforesaid

letter dated 8th August 2020 from the 1st Respondent - Respondent informing him of the

consideration of the application. It is further stated that a true copy of the said letter has been

annexed marked P6 and appears at pages 322 to 323 of the brief. However, upon examination of

the document marked P6, it is observed that the date appearing therein is 8th September 2020.

Accordingly, there exists a clear inconsistency between the date set out in the Petition and the date

appearing on the annexed document.

Referring to the petition, at the meeting held on 22nd September 2020, the 1st Respondent -

Respondent assured parents that Clause 7.4.2, which required a continuously registered lease valid

for at least one year beyond the application deadline, would not be strictly enforced. Subsequently,

the Petitioners - Appellants attended the interview on 22nd October 2020. The Interview Board

awarded the 1st Petitioner - Appellant 95 marks based on criteria including service transfer

distance, proximity of residence to the school, period of service, and unutilized leave. However,

the board retained the marks sheet for verification of unutilized leave, which was later confirmed

by the Inspector of Police, Galle, through a letter dated 5th November 2020.

10

As outlined in the petition, by January 2021, the 1st Respondent - Respondents had been

transferred, and the 6th Respondent - Respondent assumed duties as Principal of Richmond

College. The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant renewed his lease for another year, effective from 1st March

2021, and the lessor confirmed their agreement to lease the property for four years. Despite these

arrangements, no site visit was conducted to confirm the 1st Petitioner - Appellants' residence. On

17th January 2021, the school displayed the interim list of selected candidates, but the 2nd Petitioner

- Appellants childs name was not included, despite eight vacancies under the relevant category,

with only six applicants selected. Attempts by the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant to meet the 6th

Respondent - Respondent and obtain a copy of the marks sheet were unsuccessful. He was orally

informed that the application was rejected because the lease bond did not meet the one-year

validity requirement.

As per the petition, the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant addressed a letter under the Right to Information

Act, dated 24th January 2021, to obtain the marks sheet. Upon receiving it, the 2nd Petitioner -

Appellant discovered that the 6th Respondent- Respondent, who was not part of the Interview

Board, had arbitrarily nullified all previously awarded marks, citing non-compliance with Clause

7.4.2 regarding the lease bond validity. The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant filed an appeal on 26th

January 2021, submitting additional documentation to validate his residency, including the lease

agreement, lessors affidavit, utility connections, and the certificate of conformity. The Appeal and

Objection Investigation Board summoned the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant on 21st February 2021.

However, the board reportedly declined to review the submitted documents and relied solely on

the 6th Respondent - Respondents annotations.

For full disclosure, the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant stated that he had applied to three other schools:

Mahinda College, Vidyaloka College, and St. Aloysius Vidyalaya in Galle. At Mahinda College,

the 1st Petitioner - Appellant scored 89 marks but was placed fourth on the interim list and not

selected. At Vidyaloka College, he received 68 marks due to the number of nearby schools. At St.

Aloysius Vidyalaya, his application was not considered due to excessive demand.

Moreover, the Petitioner - Appellant highlighted that his youngest child, currently nine months

old, would also be eligible for admission to Richmond College if his elder sibling was admitted.

11

Based on the petition, the final list of students admitted to Grade 1 was published on 3rd of March

2021. Despite an appeal, the 1st Petitioner - Appellant was not selected, even though the Appeal

and Objection Investigation Board deemed the decision of the Interview Board acceptable. Only

seven students were admitted under the relevant category, leaving one vacancy. On 15th of March

2021, the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant received a rejection letter (P20), claiming the application

contravened the Ministry of Education Circular.

As outlined in the petition, The PetitionersAppellants states that Clause 7.4 pertains to the

category of "Brothers/Sisters of a student already in the school" and, therefore, is not applicable to

the PetitionersAppellants who have applied under a different category. In any case, applicants

under Clause 7.6 are not awarded any marks for proof of residency under Clause 7.4.2.

According to the petition, without conceding but merely assuming the position taken by the 6th to

the 11th Respondents - Respondents that the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant did not possess a lease valid

for a period of one year from the closing date of applications as required under Clause 7.4.2, it is

noted that the maximum number of marks allocated under that clause is only four. Accordingly,

even if four marks are deducted from the Petitioners total, they would still receive 91 marks. In

the final selection list, the last two students admitted had received 89 and 87 marks respectively.

Thus, the 1st Petitioner - Appellant would still qualify for admission.

The 2nd PetitionerAppellant appealed the rejection to the Human Rights Commission (HRC) and

later sought to add respondents to the complaint. However, no inquiry was conducted. It is

respectfully submitted that the Petition, at paragraph 51, states that the 2nd PetitionerAppellant

appealed to the Human Rights Commission on the 19th of March 2021, and that a true copy of the

said appeal has been annexed marked as P21. Upon perusal of the document marked P21, however,

it is observed that the date appearing therein is the 17th of May 2021. Thus, there exists a clear

inconsistency between the date set out in the Petition and the date appearing on the annexed

document.

Additionally, the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant had also submitted an appeal to the Honourable

Minister of Education. The then Minister of Education acknowledged that the relevant circular

was unjust and impracticable.

12

The petition cited media statements by the then Minister of Education acknowledging flaws in the

points system of the Circular used for admissions. These statements suggested the Circular was

impractical and unjust, necessitating revisions.

According to the petition, Clause 6.2.6 of the Circular (P1) empowers the Interview Board to

consider all relevant facts and make appropriate decisions. The Board is also required to maintain

records of its decisions, which must be communicated to the Director of National Schools. The

Petitioner Appellants argued that the rejection violated these provisions.

The Petitioners - Appellants contended that the rejection of their application was:

Arbitrary and beyond the 6th Respondent - Respondents jurisdiction.

Contrary to natural justice, as the 6th Respondent - Respondent was not part of the

Interview Board, and the Appeal Board failed to provide a proper hearing.

In violation of legitimate expectations and based on misinterpretation of the Circular.

Unreasonable, unsupported by evidence, and influenced by extraneous considerations.

Mala fide and prejudicial to the Petitioners - Appellants rights.

The Petitioners - Appellants sought a Writ of Mandamus from the Court of Appeal to compel the

6th Respondent - Respondent to admit the 1st Petitioner - Appellant to Grade 1, citing the existence

of a vacancy and the alleged illegality of the rejection decision. The Court of Appeal issued notice

on the respondents and allowed the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant to act as the 1st Petitioner -

Appellants next friend in the application. The respondents submitted their objections, and both

parties filed written submissions. On 10th December 2021, the Court of Appeal dismissed the

Petitioner - Appellants' application.

First question of law

I will now proceed to address the first question of law namely, did the Court of Appeal fail to take

cognizance of the fact that the annotation made by the 6th Respondent - Respondent is not the

collective decision of the Interview Board?

The interview for Grade 1 admissions was conducted on 22.10.2020, and the marks sheet (P11)

was signed on the same day by the 1st Respondent - Respondent, who was the Principal at the time

13

and served as the Chairman of the Interview Board, along with the other members of the board.

The marks sheet (P11) indicates that the 1st Petitioner - Appellant was awarded 95 marks by the

Interview Board. Since all members of the Interview Board signed the marks sheet (P11) on the

same day, it can be regarded as a collective decision of the Interview Board.

In order to determine whether the annotation made by the 6th Respondent - Respondent is a

collective decision of the Interview Board, we must examine whether the Circular provides any

procedure for reviewing or amending the marks awarded by the Interview Board as a collective

decision after the interview.

In Sesadi Subasinghe (Appearing Through Her Next Friend) v. Principal, Vishaka Vidyalaya

and 12 Others [2011] 1 Sri L.R. 75, the court held that;

The appellate panel and the selection board including the principal of the school is expected to

perform a public duty based on Circulars issued by the Education Department. Adopting a very

adhoc method is unsatisfactory to decide ones future in education which should be decided very

carefully.

This judicial observation underscores that all actions taken by the Interview Board must strictly

adhere to the procedures set out in the Circular.

Clause 9.2 of Circular P1 is outlined as follows:

.. 8.4

/

, ,

/

. "

The relevant section of the marks sheet format, as specified in the 2nd Schedule of Circular P1, is

as follows:

14

, /

/

.

( (

)

)

: .. ..

: ..

..

: ... ..

Additionally, the statement provided by the Petitioners - Appellants, as the applicant, in the Marks

Sheet P11 further supports the view that the Interview Board has the authority to review the marks

awarded during the interview. The relevant extract from the 2nd PetitionerAppellants statement

in P11 is as follows:

" :-

,

.

.

, ,

.

15

.

.

Accordingly, under Clause 7.4.2 of Circular P1, the Chairman or the Interview Board retains the

authority to verify the validity of Lease Agreement P4 post-interview, permitting reassessment of

the marks awarded.

The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant contends that the 6th Respondent - Respondent was not a member

of the Interview Board at the time of the interview and, therefore, lacked the authority to reduce

or nullify the marks awarded by the Interview Board when he received the marks sheet (P11) on

25.01.2021.

While the 6th Respondent - Respondent was not part of the Interview Board during the interview,

it is noted that under Clauses 6.2.1 and 6.2.4 of Circular P1, the Principal automatically assumes

the position of Chairman of the Interview Board ex officio. The Clause 6.2.4 of Circular P1 is as

follows;

,

/

. ,

.

According to the above provisions, the 6th Respondent - Respondent, upon assuming the position

of Principal of Richmond College, automatically becomes the Chairman of the Interview Board.

This is consistent with the requirements outlined in the Circular.

Clause 6.2.6 of Circular P1 grants the Interview Board the authority to make decisions on all

matters related to the admission of students to Grade 1. Since the 6th Respondent - Respondent, by

virtue of his position, serves as the ex officio Chairman of the Interview Board, he is empowered

to make annotations such as the one reflected in the marks sheet (P11).

16

As outlined in Clause 9.3.7 of Circular P1, the interim list of admissions must bear the signatures

of all members of the Interview Board before it can be published. This requirement ensures

collective approval of the list.

The specific text of Clause 9.3.7 of Circular P1 is provided below:

"

.

(9.3.5

) .''

It is noted that all members of the Interview Board, including the 6th Respondent - Respondent,

have signed the interim list P9. This demonstrates that the decision reflected in the annotation on

P11 was also an approved collective decision of the Interview Board.

Based on the foregoing, I am of the view that the Chairman of the Interview Board, or the Board

itself, holds the authority to examine the validity of the Lease Agreement P4, as stipulated in

Clause 7.4.2 of Circular P1, even after the conclusion of the interview. Consequently, it is evident

that the marks awarded during the interview may be subject to reassessment.

Accordingly, the 2nd Petitioner Appellants argument that the annotation made by the 6th

Respondent - Respondent does not represent a collective decision of the Interview Board lacks

merit. Therefore there is no valid basis to challenge the collective nature of the decision depicted

in P11.

Second question of law

I will now proceed to address the second question of law namely, did the Court of Appeal err in

law by failing to appreciate that the conduct of the 6th Respondent - Respondent was in breach of

the Rules of Natural Justice?

The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant asserts that he was not given an opportunity to explain or address

the issue before the Respondents - Respondents decided to deduct marks and make the

aforementioned annotation. The annotation in question reflects the decision of the Interview

17

Board. If so, it may constitute a breach of a fundamental principle of Natural Justice, namely the

right to be heard (Audi alteram partem).

In the case of Piyasena De Silva and Others v. Ven. Wimalawansa Thero and Another, [2006] 1

Sri LR 219, it is mentioned that according to the case of R v University of Cambridge [1723] 1

STR 557, the first hearing in human history took place in the Garden of Eden. As expressed by a

learned individual on such an occasion,

"I remember to have heard it observed by a very learned man upon such an occasion, that even

God Himself did not pass sentence upon Adam before he was called upon to make his defense.

'Adam,' says God, 'where art thou? Hast thou not eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that

thou should not eat?' And the same question was put to Eve also."

The statement emphasises that even in the earliest and most fundamental moral framework, the

right to be heard and the opportunity for defense were upheld, which has influenced the

development of legal principles across human history.

Clause 10.0 of Circular P1 explicitly guarantees the right to appeal against such decisions, a right

which the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant exercised by lodging an appeal with the Appeal/Objection

Investigation Board.

The Clause 10.0 of Circular P1 provides the procedure for appeals and objections.

During the appeal process, the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant appeared before the Board and submitted

an extended Lease Agreement (P8), covering an additional year from 01.03.2021, along with an

affidavit from the lessor of Lease Agreements P4 and P8 (P8A). The affidavit confirmed that the

lessor typically executes lease agreements on an annual basis. The other documents submitted were

marked as P13, P13A, and P13B.

Despite these submissions, the Petitioners - Appellants contend that the Appeal and/or Objection

Investigation Board, while affirming the decision of the Interview Board, failed to give due

consideration to the new documents submitted by the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant. However, it is

evident that all such documents presented to the Appeal and/or Objection Investigation Board were

new and had not been produced at the time of the interview.

18

Clause 9.2.6 of Circular P1 places a clear obligation on parents or legal guardians to provide all

necessary documents to the Interview Board at the time of the interview. Furthermore, Clause 11.8

of Circular P1 stipulates that the Appeal and/or Objection Investigation Board is restricted to

reinvestigating or reviewing only the documents submitted to the Interview Board during the

interview.

In light of these provisions, it is evident that the Appeal and/or Objection Investigation Board is

not legally authorised to consider any new documents. Accordingly, the 2nd Petitioner Appellants'

claim that the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant was denied a fair hearing prior to the final decision lacks

merit.

According to Satish Chandra in his article "Doctrine of Legitimate Expectation" published in the

Journal of the Indian Law Institute (62, no. 1), 2020, pp. 90101,

THERE ARE several principles of administrative law, which have been evolved by the courts for

the purpose of controlling the exercise of power so that it does notlead to arbitrariness or abuse

of power. These principles are intended to provide safeguard to the citizens against abuse or

misuse of power by the instrumentalities oragencies of the state. One of the latest and important

of these principles is the 'doctrine of legitimate expectation', which is an outcome of synthesis

between the principle of administrative fairness (a component of the principles of natural justice)

and the rule of estoppel.

In the case of R. v. Secretary of State for Transport Ex Parte Greater London Council [1985] 3

All ER 300, a legitimate or reasonable expectation may arise either from an express promise made

on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice that the claimant can

reasonably expect to continue.

David Foulkes (Administrative Law, 7th Edition, Butterworths,1990, pg.272) had expressed

the view that a promise or an undertaking could give rise to a legitimate expectation. Discussing

his position with regard to the concept, Foulkes had stated that;

The right to a hearing, or to be consulted, or generally to put ones case, may also arise out of

the action of the authority itself. This action may take one of two, or both forms; a promise (or a

statement or undertaking) or a regular procedure. Both the promise and the procedure are

19

capable of giving rise to what is called a legitimate expectation, that is, an expectation of the

kind which the Courts will enforce (emphasis added).

According to Vavuniya Solar Power (Private) Limited v Ceylon Electricity Board and Others SC

FR Application 172/2017 decided on 20th September, 2023;

Court cannot order public authorities to fulfil promises which are beyond their powers or

unlawful. In the event a court recognizes that a public body has made certain representations

which are ultra vires its powers, which have given rise to an expectation, it will not recognize the

existence of an enforceable substantive legitimate expectation and therefore will not require the

public authority to act contrary to law.

Such approach is founded on the following three reasons:

(i) a public body cannot enlarge its powers by making ultra vires representations. Thereby, the

principle of legality is respected and thereby, the rule of law;

(ii) requiring a public body not to be bound by its own unlawful representations would facilitate

the public body not acting contrary to law. Also, the public body will thereby not be forced to act

contrary to law;

(iii) by not requiring a public body to act contrary to law, wider public interests are protected.

The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant asserts that on 22.10.2020, the Interview Board informed him that

his son had scored 95 marks and was eligible for admission to Richmond College. As a result, the

petitioner argues that the subsequent refusal of admission constitutes a breach of his legitimate

expectation. However, it appears that the 95 marks awarded during the interview were based on

an oversight by the Interview Board, which failed to apply the correct eligibility criteria.

Nevertheless, the Interview Board took appropriate measures to rectify this mistake, and such a

correction does not equate to a failure to follow due process. Therefore, this erroneous decision

does not create a legitimate expectation.

In Rowland v. Environment Agency [2005] Ch 1 it was held that the fundamental principle is that

a legitimate expectation can only arise on the basis of a lawful promise.

20

Clauses 9.2 and 9.3 of Circular P1 authorize the Interview Board to conduct further investigations

and seek clarifications regarding the qualifications of applicants, as well as to amend the marks

awarded to an applicant during the interview, provided that such revisions occur prior to the

publication of the interim list. The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant is not entitled to rely on his

expectation unless the prescribed procedure is duly followed. The submission of a document that

does not meet the criteria for admissibility under Clause 7.4.2 of Circular P1 does not establish a

legitimate expectation for the Petitioners - Appellants. The protection of their expectations is

contingent upon adherence to the procedure outlined.

In R v. Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Behluli [1998] Imm. AR 407, at 415

Beldam LJ, observed that

although legitimate expectation may in the past have been categorized as a catchphrase not be

elevated into a principle, or as an easy cover for a general complaint about unfairness, it has

nevertheless achieved an important place in developing the law of administrative fairness. It is an

expectation which, although not amounting to an enforceable legal right, is founded on a

reasonable assumption which is capable of being protected in public law. It enables a citizen to

challenge a decision which deprives him of an expectation founded on a reasonable basis that his

claim would be dealt with in a particular way.

Therefore the mere fact that the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant was informed by the Interview Board at

the interview that he had obtained 95 marks does not confer upon the petitioners the benefit of a

legitimate expectation.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that the second question of law is devoid of merit and affirms

that the Court of Appeal did not err in law in this regard.

Third question of law

I will now proceed to address the third question of law namely, did the Court of Appeal fall into

substantial error by failing to appreciate the Respondent - Respondents interpretation of the

Circular way perfunctory?

Lord Diplock in the Duport Steels Ltd and Others v Sirs and Others [1980] UKHL J0201-1

defined the rule:

21

Where the meaning of the statutory words is plain and unambiguous it is not then for the judges

to invent fancied ambiguities as an excuse for failing to give effect to its plain meaning because

they consider the consequences for doing so would be inexpedient, or even unjust or immoral.

The 2nd Petitioner - Appellant sought to establish their residence by submitting Lease Agreement

P4 before the Interview Board. According to the requirements outlined in Clause 7.4.2 of Circular

P1, such a lease agreement can be deemed valid evidence only if it is valid for a period of one year

from the closing date for applications for admission to Grade 1.

The following is an extract from the relevant section of Clause 7.4.2 of Circular P1;

In this instance, the closing date for admission to Grade 1 at Richmond College, Galle, was

30.06.2020. The Lease Agreement P4, presented by the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant during the

interview, covered the period from 01.03.2020 to 28.02.2021. It is evident that the validity of Lease

Agreement P4 did not extend for one year from the closing date for applications.

In the case of Stassen Exports Limited. v. Brooke Bond (Ceylon) Limited and Another [1990] 2

Sri LR. Justice Amarasinghe states that;

"I do not wish to suggest that the technical meaning must always be given to words in an Act of

Parliament. What I do say is that where an enactment uses a term which has both an ordinary and

technical meaning the question of which meaning the term is intended to have is determined by the

context. If the content is technical, the presumption is that the technical meaning of the term is the

appropriate one unless the content warrants the wider meaning given to the word loquitur ut

22

vulgus, that is according to the common understanding and acceptance of the term in common

practice."

As a result, Lease Agreement P4 does not meet the requirements to be considered an admissible

document under Clause 7.6.2 in conjunction with Clause 7.4.2 of Circular P1 to support the

residency claim of the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant.

In CA (Writ) Application No: 30/2018 in (Ratnayake and Others vs C.D.Perera and others

[1982] 2 Sri LR 451.) states that;

In order to succeed with the Writ of Certiorari, the Petitioners must establish that the

Respondents have acted illegally, unreasonably or that there has been a procedural impropriety

in the decision making process. Similarly, for the Petitioners to succeed with the prayer for the

Writ of Mandamus, they must establish that they have a legal right to the performance of a public

duty by the Respondents.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that the 2nd PetitionerAppellants argument in respect of the

third question of law is answered in the negative.

Therefore, for reasons more fully adumbrated in this judgement, the appeal of the 2nd Petitioner -

Appellant is dismissed without cost. The Order of the Court of Appeal dated 10th December 2021

is affirmed.
