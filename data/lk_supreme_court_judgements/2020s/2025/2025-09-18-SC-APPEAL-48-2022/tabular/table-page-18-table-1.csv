"Clause 9.2.6 of Circular P1 places a clear obligation on parents or legal guardians to provide all"
"necessary documents to the Interview Board at the time of the interview. Furthermore, Clause 11.8"
"of  Circular  P1  stipulates  that  the  Appeal  and/or  Objection  Investigation  Board  is  restricted  to"
"reinvestigating  or  reviewing  only  the  documents  submitted  to  the  Interview  Board  during  the"
