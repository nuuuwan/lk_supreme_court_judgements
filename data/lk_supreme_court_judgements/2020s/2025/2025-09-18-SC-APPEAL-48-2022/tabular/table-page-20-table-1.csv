"Clauses 9.2 and 9.3 of Circular P1 authorize the Interview Board to conduct further investigations"
"and seek clarifications regarding the qualifications of applicants, as well as to amend the marks"
"awarded  to  an  applicant  during  the  interview,  provided  that  such  revisions  occur  prior  to  the"
"publication  of  the  interim  list.  The  2nd  Petitioner  -  Appellant  is  not  entitled  to  rely  on  his"
"expectation unless the prescribed procedure is duly followed. The submission of a document that"
"does not meet the criteria for admissibility under Clause 7.4.2 of Circular P1 does not establish a"
"legitimate  expectation  for  the  Petitioners  -  Appellants.  The  protection  of  their  expectations  is"
"contingent upon adherence to the procedure outlined."
"In R v. Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Behluli [1998] Imm. AR 407, at 415"
"Beldam LJ, observed that"
"“although legitimate expectation may in the past have been categorized as a catchphrase not be"
"elevated into a principle, or as an easy cover  for  a general  complaint about  unfairness,  it has"
"nevertheless achieved an important place in developing the law of administrative fairness. It is an"
"expectation  which,  although  not  amounting  to  an  enforceable  legal  right,  is  founded  on  a"
"reasonable assumption which is capable of being protected in public law. It enables a citizen to"
"challenge a decision which deprives him of an expectation founded on a reasonable basis that his"
"claim would be dealt with in a particular way”."
"Therefore the mere fact that the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant was informed by the Interview Board at"
"the interview that he had obtained 95 marks does not confer upon the petitioners the benefit of a"
"legitimate expectation."
"Accordingly, the Court concludes that the second question of law is devoid of merit and affirms"
"that the Court of Appeal did not err in law in this regard."
"Third question of law"
"I will now proceed to address the third question of law namely, did the Court of Appeal fall into"
"substantial  error  by  failing  to  appreciate  the  Respondent  -  Respondents’  interpretation  of  the"
"Circular way perfunctory?"
"Lord  Diplock  in  the  Duport  Steels  Ltd  and  Others  v  Sirs  and  Others  [1980]  UKHL  J0201-1"
