"Based on the petition, the final list of students admitted to Grade 1 was published on 3rd of March"
"2021. Despite an appeal, the 1st Petitioner - Appellant was not selected, even though the Appeal"
"and Objection Investigation Board deemed the decision of the Interview Board acceptable. Only"
"seven students were admitted under the relevant category, leaving one vacancy. On 15th of March"
"2021,  the  2nd  Petitioner  -  Appellant  received  a  rejection  letter  (P20),  claiming  the  application"
"contravened the Ministry of Education Circular."
"As  outlined  in  the  petition,  The  Petitioners–Appellants  states  that  Clause  7.4  pertains  to  the"
"category of ""Brothers/Sisters of a student already in the school"" and, therefore, is not applicable to"
"the Petitioners–Appellants who have applied under a different category. In any case, applicants"
"under Clause 7.6 are not awarded any marks for proof of residency under Clause 7.4.2."
"According to the petition, without conceding but merely assuming the position taken by the 6th to"
"the 11th Respondents - Respondents that the 2nd Petitioner - Appellant  did not possess a lease valid"
"for a period of one year from the closing date of applications as required under Clause 7.4.2, it is"
"noted that the maximum number of marks allocated under that clause is only four. Accordingly,"
"even if four marks are deducted from the Petitioners’ total, they would still receive 91 marks. In"
"the final selection list, the last two students admitted had received 89 and 87 marks respectively."
"Thus, the 1st Petitioner - Appellant would still qualify for admission."
"The 2nd Petitioner–Appellant appealed the rejection to the Human Rights Commission (HRC) and"
"later  sought  to  add  respondents  to  the  complaint.  However,  no  inquiry  was  conducted.  It  is"
"respectfully submitted that the Petition, at paragraph 51, states that the 2nd Petitioner–Appellant"
"appealed to the Human Rights Commission on the 19th of March 2021, and that a true copy of the"
"said appeal has been annexed marked as P21. Upon perusal of the document marked P21, however,"
"it is observed that the date appearing therein is the 17th of May 2021. Thus, there exists a clear"
"inconsistency  between  the  date  set  out  in  the  Petition  and  the  date  appearing  on  the  annexed"
"document."
"Additionally,  the  2nd  Petitioner  -  Appellant  had  also  submitted  an  appeal  to  the  Honourable"
"Minister of Education. The then Minister of Education acknowledged that the relevant  circular"
"was unjust and impracticable."
