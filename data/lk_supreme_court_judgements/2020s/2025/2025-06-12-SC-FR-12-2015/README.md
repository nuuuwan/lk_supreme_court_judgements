ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 12-06-2025

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J

We have heard the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner

and also the submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the

Respondents and concluded the argument.

The Petitioner at one point of time had served as a Police Constable attached to the

Eppawala Police Station.

Officers attached to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

(CIABOC) arrested the Petitioner on 23-04-2012. He was produced before the

Magistrates Court of Thambuttegama. Upon the Petitioner being produced before him,

the Magistrate of Thambuttegama had remanded the Petitioner. The allegation made

against the Petitioner for the said arrest was that the Petitioner had allegedly solicited

and accepted a gratification of Rs. 5000/- from R. A. Saman Kumara alias Jayantha

who has been named in this case as the 6th Respondent. Thereafter, CIABOC had taken

steps to indict the Petitioner in the High Court of Colombo under case No.

HCB/2130/2016. On 07-04-2022 the learned High Court Judge of Colombo relying upon

the Supreme Court Judgment in Anoma Polwatta v. L. Jayawickrema (SC Writ

Application No. 01/2011), had made order discharging the Petitioner from the charges

set out in the indictment on the basis that the decision to forward the said indictment

against the Petitioner had been signed only by one member of the Commission

(CIABOC) when the law requires that the Commission shall comprise three members.

Thus, we are of the view that the order pronounced by the learned High Court Judge

does not amount to an acquittal of the Petitioner from the charges in the indictment.

Indeed, the learned High Court Judge at the end of his Order dated (07-04-2022) has

[SC FR 12/2015] - Page 4 of 6

specifically mentioned that the said Order is not a bar for CIABOC to forward a

subsequent indictment on the same charges.

Subsequent to the afore-mentioned arrest, the Petitioner was issued a charge sheet

which the Respondents have produced marked 1R2. Thereafter, a formal disciplinary

inquiry proceeding was conducted. At the end of the disciplinary inquiry, the inquiring

officer by his report dated 29-04-2014 which the Respondent has produced marked (Y)

has found the Petitioner guilty of both charges in the charge sheet. It was in accordance

with the said finding of guilt that the Petitioner has been dismissed from service.

In this Petition, the Petitioner has alleged firstly that the said disciplinary inquiry was

held contrary to the general principals applicable to conduct of disciplinary procedures

and secondly that the charges were based on a false allegation. The Petitioner has

alleged that this was done with a view to wrongfully implicate him to the alleged

offence. The Respondents have submitted to this Court, a complete copy of the

disciplinary proceedings conducted against the Petitioner.

We have perused the evidence and the Disciplinary Order. The 6th Respondent who

was the Complainant against the Petitioner who has alleged that the Petitioner had

solicited and accepted a bribe of Rs. 5000/-, has given evidence before the inquiring

officer. The said witness has been cross examined by the representative who appeared

for the Petitioner.

As pointed out by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, we also observe that the

inquiring officer has explained the matters relating to the conduct of disciplinary

proceedings to the Petitioner in following terms;

This convinces us that the inquiring officer has taken all steps necessary to ensure the

smooth conduct of the disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner fairly.

Therefore, we are of the view that there is no merit in the complaint made by the

Petitioner that the disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner was conducted

contrary to the accepted legal principles relevant to the conduct of disciplinary

proceedings.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner also sought to argue that since there is

no pending criminal prosecution against the Petitioner, the Petitioner is entitled to be

reinstated in service. However, as pointed out by the learned Deputy Solicitor General,

we observe that this Court in SC/FR/No. 273/2014 decided on 04-06-2015 has taken

the view that such criminal proceedings would not be a relevant matter to decide on

the guilt of a person in a disciplinary proceeding. The relevant part in the said judgment

is as follows:

The learned Deputy Solicitor General with emphasis argues that the outcome

of the High Court case filed against the Petitioner has no bearing on the

disciplinary order made against the Petitioner by the Police Department after

a due inquiry. It is also said that a criminal prosecution and disciplinary

[SC FR 12/2015] - Page 6 of 6

proceedings are independent of one another. As contained in chapter XLVII

and Section 28.6 and 28.7 of the Establishment Code an acquittal or

discharge by a Court of Law will not be a ground to set aside a disciplinary

Order made in a disciplinary inquiry. The burden of proof defer in the above

two proceedings. The said Sections 28.6 and 28.7 reads thus:

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner also informs Court that at the moment,

an appeal lodged by the Petitioner against the finding of his guilt is pending before the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

We are of the view that the correctness of the Disciplinary Order could be decided in

that proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

Having considered the submissions made by the learned Counsel for both parties and

the material adduced before us, we see no basis to interfere in the final Disciplinary

Order made against the Petitioner in the above instance.

We also have no basis to hold with the Petitioner that there is an infringement of his

Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Therefore, we

refuse to grant the declaration prayed for, by the Petitioner in this Petition.

We decide to dismiss this Petition without costs.
