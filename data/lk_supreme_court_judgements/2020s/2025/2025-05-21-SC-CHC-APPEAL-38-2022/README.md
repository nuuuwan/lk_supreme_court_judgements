A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

1. The Plaintiff Appellant, a corporate entity, instituted this action in the

Commercial High Court against the Defendant Respondent, the National

Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), averring delay in the issuance of the

certificate of registration and the subsequent licences required for importation

of medical devices.

2. In other words, this was a suit against the National Medicines Regulatory

Authority for damages in a sum of Rupees 497,700,000 (Four Hundred and

Ninety-Seven Million Seven Hundred Thousand). The Plaintiff Appellant

(the Plaintiff) claimed that the failure of the Defendant-Respondent (the

Defendant) to issue, or to timely renew, the licences during the periods 2013-

2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 caused substantial

financial loss.

3. The Plaintiff alleged that this loss directly resulted from the malicious and

wrongful conduct of the Defendant in negligently delaying the grant of the

required licences.

4. Following the settlement of issues at a pre-trial conference, the matter

proceeded to trial in the Commercial High Court.

5. The learned Commercial High Court Judge by his judgment dated 11/11/2021

dismissed the Plaintiffs action. The reasons given by the learned Commercial

High Court Judge is that the delay in renewing the licences was caused not by

the Defendant but by the Plaintiff Company itself. The learned High Court

Judge states that the Plaintiff made belated applications for renewal of the

licences and it was itself at fault for not furnishing the required documents for

the purpose of obtaining the subsequent licences.

6. It is quite apparent from a perusal of the record that the licences are given by

virtue of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act No. 05 of 2015.

4

There was also a Gazette Notification that had been issued prescribing the

procedure for the grant of licences. The overriding and pervasive allegation

against the Defendant is one of malicious and mala fide conduct in prolonging

the grant of licences. It has to be borne in mind that the Defendant (NMRA)

is a statutory body or a legal entity which is created as a body corporate by the

aforesaid legislation.

7. Taking a look at the plaint and the issues, I would classify this action as

having been premised on malice (dolus). The action based on malice is founded

upon the basis that the NMRA maliciously delayed the grant of licenses so as

to contribute to the economic loss of the Plaintiff Company. In other words,

the NMRA is vested with a statutory discretion to grant or refuse a license

and the exercise of the discretionary power that took place in this case is

alleged to be malicious and mala fide. Simply put, the crux of the complaint

before the Commercial High Court was that while licenses for four years were

given belatedly, a license for the year 2017 - 2018 was not granted at all.

8. On the question of the availability of actions founded upon negligence (culpa)

and malice (dolus) in relation to the exercise of statutory power, I observe that

Sri Lankan jurisprudence recognizes the concurrent availability of both causes

of action under the principles of the Lex Aquilia - see David v. Abdul Cader1.

For causes of action founded upon malice or mala fides in the case of an invalid

exercise of discretionary power - see Corea v. Corea2.

9. Certainly the case filed by the Plaintiff in the instant appeal was not based

on negligence and I hasten to point out that Section 143 (2) of the National

Medicines Regulatory Authority Act No. 05 of 2015 impliedly takes away

the right of a person to file an action in negligence against the NMRA.

1 (1971) 77 NLR 18 - The Plaintiff succeeded in being awarded damages by the then Supreme Court on May 30, 1971. H.N.G. Fernando, C.J (p.23) said: "Wille (Principles of South African Law, 5th ed., 502) states that, 'legislation, by imposing a duty, positive or negative, on one person, may impliedly confer a right on another person ...and if the person subject to the duty commits a breach of the duty, his act or omission is equivalent to culpa and is an infringement of the right.' 2 (1925) 27 NLR 328

5

Section 143 of the NMRA makes this position patently clear and I will revert

to this matter more fully after having alluded to the facts immanent to this

case.

10. There is incontrovertible evidence before this Court that the Defendant

Authority was unable to issue the relevant licenses on the stipulated dates,

owing to the Plaintiffs failure to furnish all requisite information as called for

by the Authority. The testimony of a witness whose evidence remained

uncontroverted established that the Plaintiff, in submitting annual

applications, consistently failed to comply with the documentary requirements

in a timely manner. Such conduct amounted to a breach of the gazette

notifications issued under the Cosmetic, Devices and Drugs Act, No. 27 of

1980. While these notifications stipulated a time period for applications to be

made, a belated application outside the time limit causes administrative

inconvenience and it has to be borne in mind that the time limits for making

the applications are given so as to enable officials in a department or authority

to process the application and any applicant for a license who falls foul of the

time limits cannot complain of negligence or malice on the part of of officials

dealing with such applications.

11. The substance of the testimony thus clearly indicates that the delays in the

issuance of licenses were directly attributable to the Plaintiff Companys own

omissions.

12. The non-issuance of the import license for the year 2017/2018 has also been

satisfactorily explained. Evidence has been led to demonstrate that the

Defendant Authority had, in response to concerns regarding price disparities

of medical devices in the market, introduced regulatory requirements

mandating that applicants submit proof of pricing. The testimony of a key

witness established that the Plaintiff failed to comply with this requirement.

Further, there is unchallenged testimony that the Plaintiff had not obtained

a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), giving rise to a reasonable inference

6

that the relevant imports had not been processed through official customs

procedures but through alternative channels. On the totality of the evidence,

it appears that this non-compliance on the part of the Plaintiff constituted the

basis for the Defendant Authoritys refusal to issue the license for the said

period.

13. As I stated before, it is apposite now to draw attention to Section 143 (2) of the

National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act No. 05 of 2015 which reads as

follows:

No civil or criminal proceedings shall be instituted against a

person for any act which in good faith is done or purported to

be done by him under this Act or any regulation made

thereunder.

14. In terms of the aforesaid provision, it is manifestly clear that only actions

founded on mala fides (i.e malice or bad faith) are maintainable against the

NMRA, whilst any other action, including one predicated on negligence, is by

necessary implication excluded. Section 143 (2) further stipulates that in order

to succeed in an action grounded on malice (dolus), the Plaintiff must

establish that the impugned act was committed by a person with the requisite

intent of malice.

15. In other words, in the case of an invalid exercise of discretionary power, the

person who so acted wrongfully could be liable in delict only if he is proved to

have acted mala fide. Following the English Law, it has been held that,

"As a rule when the discharge of a public duty imposed by statute

upon a person or bodies of persons involves the exercise of a

discretion which is not a merely ministerial act, if the discretion

7

has been exercised erroneously, no action lies except upon proof

mala fides or indirect motive".3

..If a man is required in the discharge of a public duty to make

a decision which affects, by its legal consequences the liberty or

property of others, and he performs that duty and makes that

decision honestly and in good faith, it is, in my opinion, a

fundamental principle, of our law that he is protected. It is not

consonant with the principles of our law to require a man to make

such a decision in the discharge of his duty to the public, and then

to leave him in peril by reason of the consequences to others of that

decision, provided that he has acted honestly in making that

decision. 4

16. The word person in Section 143 (2) specifically imports the requirement of

identification of such a person in the plaint and proof of that person as having

acted in bad faith. A legal person, like a natural person, can be held to have

acted with malice, and could therefore become liable in damages or injuria

under the Actio Injuriarum;5 or in the alternative it can become vicariously

liable for an injuria committed with malice by its agent or servant. The issue

raised on malice against the NMRA has been answered in the negative and

that finding cannot in any way be struck down as perverse.

17. In Singer Sewing Machine Company v. Bowes6, it was held that where

malice is averred, it must be pleaded with particularity; the Defendant must

be identified with reasonable certainty, and malice must be specifically alleged

and proved against that Defendant. In the present matter, the allegation of

malice is directed ipso facto against the juridical person, namely, the National

3 See Jayawardene A.J., Corea v Corea (1925) 27 NLR 228 at 335. 4 Lord Moulton in the House of Lords, in Everett v Griffiths (1921) AC 631, 695-696, cited by Jayawardene A.J., in Corea v Corea (1925) 27 NLR 328, 335. 5 Kandasamy v. Municipal Council of Colombo (1905) 1 ACR 90. 6 4 CWR 78

8

Medicines Regulatory Authority, but no such mental element was established

against the NMRA or any of its servants, let alone their identification with

certainty.

18. No averment has been made in the pleadings, nor has any issue been raised,

identifying any particular individual within the Defendant's legal entity as

having maliciously or wrongfully caused the alleged delay in the grant of

licences. A bare allegation of malice directed at a corporate entity, without

specifying the individuals - the directing minds or agents who are said to have

committed the impugned acts, is insufficient. In the absence of such

identification and without establishing a delictual nexus between those

individuals and the statutory body, the claim cannot be sustained.

19. The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court, in addressing the issue of

malice and mala fides, correctly concluded that malice had not been

established. As I said before, that finding in the absence of an error of law,

must dispose of the allegation of malice. This Court finds no material on record

that specifically identifies or accuses any individual within the National

Medicines Regulatory Authority of having maliciously withheld or delayed the

grant or renewal of licences. In such circumstances, the imputation of malice

to the statutory body becomes unsustainable, as the requisite nexus between

any particular individual conduct and institutional liability has not been

demonstrated.

20. This is a case where malice and mala fides were directly attributed to the

statutory entity itself. The question is whether the alleged delay in granting

the licenses is referable to malice or mala fides of the Defendant Authority.

In other words, even though the Defendant issued licenses for the years

ranging from 2013 / 2014, 2014 / 2015, 2015 / 2016 to 2017 to import medical

devices, the Plaintiff averred that the delay contributed to the damages. In

regard to the year 2017 / 2018 the Defendant failed to issue any licences at all.

9

21. It would appear that this case suffers from want of a cause of action against

the statutory body and I see no reason to interfere with the finding and

conclusion of the learned Commercial High Court judge. De Sampayo, J.

articulated the following view in Lowe Vs. Fernando7

"The expression 'cause of action' generally imparts two things, viz,

a right in the plaintiff and a violation of it by the defendant, and

cause of action means the whole cause of action i.e. all the facts

which together constitute the plaintiff's right to maintain the

action, (Dicey's parties to an action Ch. XI Sec. A) or, as it has

been otherwise put, the media upon which the plaintiff asks the

court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour (Lord Watson's

judgement in Kaur vs Singh)

22. This was also emphasized in Narendra Vs. Seylan Merchant Bank8 and

reiterated by Dheeraratne, J. in Eksith Fernando Vs. Manawadu and

Others9.

23. No such person, as we have observed in the course of this judgment, has been

identified or established to have been the wrong doer in this case. It has to be

borne in mind by all trial judges that one cannot open the flood gates for

litigation in respect of allegedly incorrect or invalid administrative decisions

unless malice and mala fides are particularized with definite certainty. This

would be the effect of Section 143 (2) as aforesaid. Section 143 (2) predicates

only an action based on dolus and not an action premised on culpa.

24. In the circumstances, this Court holds no mala fides or bad faith has been

established and there is no evidence to counter the strong and compelling case

that it is the Plaintiff Company that contributed to the delay in the grant of

7 16 NLR 398 8 2003 2 Sri.LR 01 9 2001(4) Sri.LR 95

the licenses which it applied for. Accordingly, I affirm the judgement of the

Commercial High Court dated 11 November 2021 and proceed to dismiss this

appeal.
