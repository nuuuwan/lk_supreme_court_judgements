"16. The  word  person  in  Section  143  (2)  specifically  imports  the  requirement  of"
"identification of such a person in the plaint and proof of that person as having"
"acted in bad faith. A legal person, like a natural person, can be held to have"
"acted  with  malice,  and  could  therefore  become  liable  in  damages  or  injuria"
"under the Actio Injuriarum;5 or in the alternative it can become vicariously"
"liable for an injuria committed with malice by its agent or servant. The issue"
"raised on malice against the NMRA has been answered in the negative and"
"that finding cannot in any way be struck down as perverse."
