"A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J."
"1.  The  Plaintiff  –  Appellant,  a  corporate  entity,  instituted  this  action  in  the"
"Commercial  High  Court  against  the  Defendant  –  Respondent,  the  National"
"Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), averring delay in the issuance of the"
"certificate of registration and the subsequent licences required for importation"
"of medical devices."
"2.  In  other  words,  this  was  a  suit  against  the  National  Medicines  Regulatory"
"Authority  for  damages  in  a  sum  of  Rupees  497,700,000  (Four  Hundred  and"
"Ninety-Seven  Million  Seven  Hundred  Thousand).  The  Plaintiff  –  Appellant"
"(the  Plaintiff)  claimed  that  the  failure  of  the  Defendant-Respondent  (the"
"Defendant) to issue, or to timely renew, the licences during the periods 2013-"
"2014,  2014-2015,  2015-2016,  2016-2017,  and  2017-2018  caused  substantial"
"financial loss."
"3.  The  Plaintiff  alleged  that  this  loss  directly  resulted  from  the  malicious  and"
"wrongful  conduct  of  the  Defendant  in  negligently  delaying  the  grant  of  the"
"required licences."
"4.  Following  the  settlement  of  issues  at  a  pre-trial  conference,  the  matter"
"proceeded to trial in the Commercial High Court."
"5.  The learned Commercial High Court Judge by his judgment dated 11/11/2021"
"dismissed the Plaintiff’s action. The reasons given by the learned Commercial"
"High Court Judge is that the delay in renewing the licences was caused not by"
"the Defendant but by the Plaintiff Company itself.  The learned High Court"
"Judge states that the Plaintiff made belated applications for renewal of the"
"licences and it was itself at fault for not furnishing the required documents for"
"the purpose of obtaining the subsequent licences."
"6.  It is quite apparent from a perusal of the record that the licences are given by"
"virtue  of  the  National  Medicines  Regulatory  Authority  Act  No.  05  of  2015."
