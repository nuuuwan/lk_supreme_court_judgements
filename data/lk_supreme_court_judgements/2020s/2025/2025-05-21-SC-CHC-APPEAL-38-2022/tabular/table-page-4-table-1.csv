"There  was  also  a  Gazette  Notification  that  had  been  issued  prescribing  the"
"procedure  for  the  grant  of  licences.  The  overriding  and  pervasive  allegation"
"against the Defendant is one of malicious and mala fide conduct in prolonging"
"the grant of licences. It has to be borne in mind that the Defendant (NMRA)"
"is a statutory body or a legal entity which is created as a body corporate by the"
"aforesaid legislation."
