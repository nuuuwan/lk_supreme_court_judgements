THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. At the very root of the narrative which concerns the instant appeal is a lady by the name

of Weeralatha and her husband, B.S.A. Silva, who, claiming to be employees of M/s Laksiri

International Freight Forwarders Private Ltd. (the Appellant), had made a complaint to

the Commissioner General of Labour with regard to non-payment of their gratuity in

terms of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983 (as amended).

2. M/s Laksiri International Freight Forwarders Private Ltd is a business more commonly

known under the brand names Laksiri Seva and Laksiri International providing services

to Sri Lankans in the Middle East to ship their personal belongings when migrating.

SC Appeal 20/2024 & 21/2024 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 11

3. The Appellant states that it engages a network of foreign service providers, including

companies which provide shipping, freight as well as air cargo services. According to the

Appellant, such service providers use the Appellants branding Laksiri Seva or Laksiri

International in conducting their businesses in order to promote their own businesses in

their respective countries.

4. The complaint of the Virtual Complainant, P.G.I. Weeralatha, as already noted, is that she

was an employee of the Appellant from 01st April 1995 to 20th October 2011 in Dubai

and that the Appellant defaulted her EPF and gratuity payments. The position of the

Appellant with regard to this complaint had been a simple one throughoutthat is, they

never employed the said Weeralatha.

5. Following this complaint, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Respondent) had held an inquiry and the Appellant had

filed written submissions on 23rd January 2013 stating that they did not operate a branch

in Dubai or anywhere else in the world except within Sri Lanka. The Appellant states that

it requested the supporting documents and written submissions submitted by

Weeralatha be furnished to it. The Appellant had further reserved the right to file

additional written submissions after perusing these supporting documents. However, the

Labour Department had neither summoned the Appellant again nor informed the

Appellant of any finding against it.

6. The Appellant states that it did not get an opportunity to peruse and respond to the

documents submitted by the Virtual Complainant before the Labour Department.

Thereafter, on 02nd March 2016, the Respondent had filed a certificate in the Magistrate

Court of Colombo under Section 8(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983 (as

amended) seeking the enforcement of an order to recover Rs. 215,837.28 as gratuity and

a further Rs. 64,751.18 as surcharges with respect to the said payment of gratuity to the

SC Appeal 20/2024 & 21/2024 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 11

Virtual Complainant, P.G.I. Weeralatha. The Appellant states that it was not informed of

any decision taken against them and that a red notice was not sent to them, which is

contrary to the usual practice.

7. Upon receiving summons from the Magistrates Court, the Appellant had appeared

before the Court and made several objections. The Magistrates Court by Order dated

10th May 2018 has ordered the Appellant to pay the amount specified in the certificate

as a fine, as may be deemed in terms of the Act, and has imposed 3 months imprisonment

in default thereof.

8. Aggrieved by the said Order of the Magistrates Court, the Appellant had invoked the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of Colombo. The High Court, by Order

dated 10th August 2018, has refused to issue notices dismissing the application.

Aggrieved by said the Order, the Appellant had then appealed to the Court of Appeal,

simultaneously preferring a revision application to the Court of Appeal as well. In a single

consolidated Judgment, dated 14th July 2023, the Court of Appeal has dismissed the

appeal of the Appellant subject to costs.

9. Both parties have moved to deliver a single consolidated judgment in both SC Appeal

20/2024 and SC Appeal 21/2024, and this Court granted leave on the following question

of law:

Whether the Court of Appeal, Provincial High Court and the Magistrates Court erred

in law in awarding the payment of gratuity to P.G.I. Weeralatha (purported

workman) when there is insufficient evidence to establish an employer-employee

relationship between her and the Petitioner [Appellant]?

10. Accordingly, the only question this Court is confronted with is whether or not there is an

employer-employee relationship between the Virtual Complainant and the Appellant.

SC Appeal 20/2024 & 21/2024 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 11

11. The Appellant contends that any and all documents the Virtual Complainant has

presented before the Respondent, except for one document, which the Appellant claims

to be a forgery, are documentation that relates to foreign companies, some of which

were in the Appellants network of service providers.

12. The single document which relates to the Appellant, marked P1,1 which is a letter dated

28th July 2000 addressed to The Finance Co. Ltd., carries the letterhead of the Appellant

and is purportedly signed by its Chairman, one M.S.M. Ruwaisden. The contents of this

purported letter certify that Mrs. Pimidiya Gedera Irin Weeralatha has been employed as

a receptionist at the Appellants branch office in Ajman, United Arab Emirates from the

year 1995 and further state that a salary of 900 UAE Dirhams been paid by the said office

in Ajman.

13. It was the position of the Respondent that such a singular document was sufficient to

establish the employer-employee relationship, citing in support the judgment of

Samayawardhena, J. for the Court of Appeal (as His Lordship then was) in Cinnamon

Hotel Management Limited v. Commissioner General of Labour.2 While I agree with

this proposition, we must necessarily inquire into the genuineness as well as the

probative value of this document marked P1.

14. The Appellant alleges this letter to be a forgery. However, as the learned Deputy Solicitor

General contended, the Appellant did nought to support this allegation. The Appellant

did not make any complaints to the Criminal Investigation Department or the Fraud

Investigation Bureau regarding the alleged forgery. Moreover, they could have provided

2 SC Writ 284/2015, CA Minutes of 25th July 2019

SC Appeal 20/2024 & 21/2024 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 11

an affidavit from the author of the purported letter, Mr. Ruwaisden, speaking to the

authenticity of the letter. None of these things have been done.

15. The Appellant contended that it should not be required to prove a negative, citing the

recent judgment of this Court in Multi Form Chemicals Limited v. Adrian Machado3

wherein Janak De Silva, J. opined as follows:

Moreover, the Respondent cannot be asked to prove the negative, namely that the

purchase orders were not issued by him. In Laxmibai (Dead) Thru Lr'S. and

Another v. Bhagwanthbuva (Dead) Thru Lr'S. and Others [Civil Appeal No.

2058 of 2003, Decided on 29.01.2013] the Indian Supreme held (at para. 15) that

a negative fact cannot be proved by adducing positive evidence.

Nanda Senanayake in Legal Maxims and Phrases [1st ed. (Printed by author, 2023),

pages 434-436] states that a negative is usually incapable of proof. The decision in

New Indian Assurance Company Ltd. v. Nusli Neville Wadiya and Another

[Case No. Appeal (Civil) 5879 of 2007, Decided on 13.12.2007] is cited in

support. There, the Supreme Court of India referred (at para. 54) to the legal maxim,

ei incumbit probation qui dicit, non qui negat (The burden of proving a fact rest on

the party who substantially asserts the affirmative of the issue and not upon the party

who denies it; for a negative is usually incapable or proof).4

16. The authenticity of this letter is, in fact, questionable. Granted, the letter is printed on the

Appellants stationery, but it does not bear the Appellants seal. At no stage has this letter

been verified, nor has it been certified as a true copy. What is available is a mere

3 S.C. Appeal No. 183/2011, SC Minutes of 18th July 2024

4 ibid at 15

SC Appeal 20/2024 & 21/2024 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 11

photocopy of a letter which appears to carry the signature of the then-chairman. The

probative value of such a document, needless to say, is little.

17. The learned Magistrate as well as the judges of the High Court and the Court of Appeal

have placed heavy reliance on this document in arriving at their respective conclusions.

In this, they have erred. It must also be noted that the Appellant did not have an

opportunity to respond to this document until all such documents were filed before the

Magistrates Court.

18. Many other documents submitted by the Virtual Complainant are available in the

Magistrates Court Record. However, none supports the position that the Virtual

Complainant was an employee of the Appellant company. The document marked P2 is

purportedly a profit and loss account from April to July 2011. It carries not the name of

the Appellant company but of a company by the name of Capitol Freight Systems LLC

Ajman. This, too, is a mere photocopy which has not been authenticated. It contains an

expense entry of 3,600presumably UAE Dirhams, as the account itself does not indicate

the currencylabelled Salary Latha.

19. The name Capitol Freight Systems LLC appears once more in a document marked P5

in the Magistrates Court Record. More precisely, this document (labelled a sales report)

mentions the company name as Capitol Freight System LLC Cargo Services (Laksiri

Internationell). A near identical document, marked P4, relates to a company named Al

Robban Shipping, Tourism & Cargo Services. Dubai U.A.E. (Laksiri Internationell). Neither

of these documents has been certified as authentic. Although neither of the parties

pointed out, the Court observed that both have misspelt the word international as

internationell. This naturally leads any reasonable mind to doubt the authenticity of

these documents.

SC Appeal 20/2024 & 21/2024 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 11

20. More importantly, the Appellant contends that, even if they had any branches in the UAE

at the time, the Virtual Complainant could not have been employed with them as she

had not had work visas during such time she claimed to have been an employee of the

Appellant Company. None of the documents before us, but for one, speaks of her visa.5

This document indicates her profession as housewife as of 06th February 2010. This

clearly contradicts the position of the position of the Virtual Complainant that she was

employed by the Appellant from 01st April 1995 to 20th October 2011. In their judgments,

the learned Magistrate and the judges of the High Court as well as the Court of Appeal

have failed to take due cognisance of the aforementioned.

21. For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that sufficient evidence has not been adduced

to establish an employer-employee relationship between the Virtual Complainant and

the Appellant. Accordingly, the question of law is answered in the affirmative.

22. Having answered the question of law as such, I would be remiss if I said nothing of the

Commissioners function under Section 8(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act. As the

learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted, in an inquiry conducted by the

Commissioner under and in terms of this section, a court-like meticulousness cannot

reasonably be expected. However, it must not be forgotten that the Commissioner in

conducting such inquiries performs a quasi-judicial function.

23. Indeed, the employer-employee relationship is hardly one where there is equal

bargaining power and the power dynamic, axiomatically, is tilted towards the employer.

That is the very reason why the law empowers courts of law to use just and equitable

jurisdiction in adjudicating various aspects of labour relations. However that may be,

5 Supreme Court Brief of SC Appeal No. 20/2024 at p. 125; Supreme Court Brief of SC Appeal 21/2024 at p. 129

SC Appeal 20/2024 & 21/2024 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 11

courts of law, as well as all such authorities performing quasi-judicial functions, must

adhere to the principles of natural justice.

24. In the instant case, the Appellant ardently pointed out that they were not afforded an

opportunity to peruse the documents submitted by the Virtual Complainant to the

Commissioner. This is a serious violation of the principle audi alteram partem, which is a

cornerstone of fair and impartial administration of justice.

25. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed. The decisions of the Magistrates Court, the High

Court and the Court of Appeal as well as the certificate issued by the Commissioner of

Labour are hereby set aside. No orders as to costs.

Appeal Allowed.
