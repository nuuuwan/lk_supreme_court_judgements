"S.C. Appeal No.88/3034"
"It is clearly an instance of a Constitutional ouster of the jurisdiction"
"of  the  Courts  from  instituting  actions  before  them,  seeking  to  adjudicate"
"upon  the  “orders”  and  “decisions”  made  by  the  PSC.  Article  61A,  not  only"
"ousts  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Courts  of  First  Instance,  but  also  ousts  the"
"jurisdiction  conferred  on  the  Court  of  Appeal  under  Article  140,  as  that"
"Court, although a superior Court of record, must exercise that jurisdiction"
"subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution.  The  case  of  Ratnasiri  and"
"Others v Ellawala and Others (supra) was decided on this very point."
