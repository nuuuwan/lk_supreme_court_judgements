"5th Defendant, an immunity clause is a provision by which the Parliament"
"exempts 
certain 
individuals, 
entities 
or 
certain 
actions 
from 
legal"
"proceedings,  under 
specified 
circumstances,  whereas  a 
jurisdictional"
"ouster  clause  is  a  provision  of  law  that  specifically  limits  or  removes  the"
"authority of a Court or a tribunal to hear or determine a particular class of"
"disputes or issues. Therefore, such clauses operate as effective procedural"
"barrier to the very act of initiation of any adjudication process against such"
"disputes  or 
issues  and 
this 
is  achieved  by  declaring  certain  class  of"
"disputes or issues being non-justiciable or by vesting exclusive jurisdiction"
"over such matters in an alternative forum."
