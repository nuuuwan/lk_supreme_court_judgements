"S.C. Appeal No.88/3034"
"Learned Additional S.G., strongly contended that the Article 61A is"
"not an article that confer an immunity, whether qualified or otherwise, on"
"members of the PSC."
"What  was  meant  by  the  draftsmen  of  the  Constitution  by  inserting"
"the marginal notes that reads “kvq lghq;+ j,ska uqla;sh” or “immunity from legal"
"proceedings”  could  easily  be  understood,  if  one  makes  a  comparison  of"
"marginal  note  of  the  Article  61A  with  that  of  Article  35,  which  reads  in"
"Sinhala  “ckdêm;sjrhdg  úreoaOj  kvq  mejrsh  fkdyels  nj”  and 
in  English  as"
"“[I]mmunity  of  President  from  suit”.  The  difference  between  the  marginal"
"notes of Articles 35 and 111K and the others which were referred to above"
"is  obvious.  The  Sinhala  text  of  the  phrase  contained  in  Articles  35  that"
"reads  “Tyqg úreoaOj lsisu wêlrKhl fy` úksYaph wêldrhl lsisu kvq lghq;a;la"
"m
e
jrSu fy` mj;ajdf.k hdu fkdl< hq;a;f;ah” with the English translation “… no"
"civil  or 
criminal  proceedings 
shall  be 
instituted  or 
continued  against 
the"
"President…”  clearly  speaks  of  an  instance  of  immunity  conferred  on  the"
"President  of  the  Republic.  Similarly,  Article  111K  too  carries  the  almost"
"identical words in the Sinhala text “… Tyqg úreoaOj lsisu wêlrKhl fy` úksYaph"
"wêldrhl  lsisu  kvq  lghq;a;la  mjrkq  fkd,eìh  hq;a;f;ah”,  with 
the  English"
"instituted  or 
translation  that  “…  no  civil  or  criminal  proceedings  shall  be"
"continued  against  …”  and  thereby  conferring  the  members  and  certain"
"officials  of  the  Judicial  Service  Commission  referred  to  therein  with  an"
"immunity from legal proceedings against them."
"However,  the  common  and  almost  identical  phrase  that  appears  in"
"Articles  153E  and  155C  that  “… lsisu wêlrKhlg fy` úksYaph wêldrhlg n,h"
"fy` wêlrK n,h fkdue;af;ah” is clear in its  meaning that it must be taken as"
"33"
