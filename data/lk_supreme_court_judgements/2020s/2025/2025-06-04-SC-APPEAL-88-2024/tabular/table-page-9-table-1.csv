"S.C. Appeal No.88/3034"
"Learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Plaintiff,  during  the  hearing  of"
"the appeals, has presented his primary contention that the Article 61A only"
"confers,  what  he  termed  only  a  “qualified  immunity”  (as  opposed  to  an"
"absolute  immunity)  on  the  members  of  the  PSC,  who  therefore  cannot"
"claim any privilege that had been afforded by the Constitution, creating an"
"exception  to  the  fundamental  right  of  equality,  guaranteed  to  her  under"
"Article 12(1), if they act mala fide."
