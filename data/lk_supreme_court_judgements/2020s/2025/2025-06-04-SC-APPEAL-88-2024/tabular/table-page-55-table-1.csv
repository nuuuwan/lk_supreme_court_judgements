"S.C. Appeal No.88/3034"
"and  orders,  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  in  terms  of  Article"
"126(1) and also of the AAT."
"Having  dealt  applicable  Constitutional  provisions  and  the  relevant"
"jurisprudence that had developed around them in relation to the question"
"of law this Court must determine, it is time that a reference is made to the"
"judgments  of  the  Courts  below  and  consider  its  validity,  based  on  the"
"above determinations."
"Upon  being  served  with  summons  of  the  instant  action,  issued  by"
"the  District  Court,  the  2nd  Defendant  filed  a  Motion  in  that  Court  on"
"22.10.2021,  wherein  an  objection  to  the  invocation  of  the  jurisdiction  of"
"Court was raised under Article  61A. The 1st  and 3rd  to 8th Defendants  too"
"have  tendered  their  Statement  of  Objections  dated  16.11.2021.  They  have"
"specifically pleaded that the impugned decisions were taken as ‘decisions’"
"of  the  PSC  and  the  District  Court  has  no  jurisdiction  to  inquire  into  or"
"pronounce  upon  or  in  any  manner  call  in  question  any  such  order  or"
"decision."
"The  District  Court,  after  an  inquiry  into  the  objection  raised  on  its"
"jurisdiction, made an order rejecting the said objection. The rejection of the"
"said objection  was    primarily  made  on  the  footing  that no  “immunity”,  as"
"conferred  on  the  President  of  the  Republic  or  on  the  members  of  the"
"Judicial Service Commission, was conferred on any of the members of the"
"PSC  and,  since  the  “immunity”  conferred  on  the  members  of  the  Election"
"Commission is limited to the acts done in good faith, in this instance too,"
"an action could be instituted and maintained against the Defendants, when"
"55"
