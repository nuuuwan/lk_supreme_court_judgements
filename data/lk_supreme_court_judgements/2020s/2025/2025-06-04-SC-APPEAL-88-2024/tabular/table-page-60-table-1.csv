"It  is  of  relevance  at  this  point  to  quote  Wadugodapitiya  J,  in  Victor"
"Ivan v Hon. Sarath N. Silva and Others (supra) where his Lordship made a"
"pertinent observation  in  respect  of  a  matter,  somewhat  similar  to the  one"
"presented before this Court, in this instance. His Lordship stated (at p. 327)"
"“[I] am constrained to say that what the Petitioners are asking this Court to do, is"
"in effect to amend, by judicial action, Article 35 of the Constitution, by ruling that"
"the immunity enjoyed by the President is not immunity at all. This, of course, it is"
"not  within  the  powers  of  this  Court  to  do.  In  the  guise  of  judicial  decisions  and"
"rulings Judges cannot and will not seek to usurp the functions of the Legislature,"
"especially where the Constitution itself is concerned” (emphasis added)."
