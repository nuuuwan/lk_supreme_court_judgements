"S.C. Appeal No.88/3034"
"an instance of effectively taking away the jurisdiction of Courts, subject to"
"the  Constitutional  provisions  contained  therein.  Article  104A(a)  confers"
"immunity  to  the  members  of  the  Election  Commission  while  imposing  a"
"Constitutional ouster of jurisdiction by Article 104A(b)."
"In  view  of  the  above  considerations,  it  is  my  considered  view  that"
"the marginal note that reads “kvq lghq;+ j,ska uqla;sh” or “immunity from legal"
"proceedings”  does  not 
indicate 
the  position 
that 
the  Article  61A  was"
"intended to confer any ‘immunity’ on the PSC as such, but only imposes a"
"Constitutional  ouster  of 
jurisdiction  of  Courts 
to  adjudicate  upon 
its"
"decisions and orders which was sought to be achieved by taking away the"
"jurisdiction  already  conferred  by 
law  on  such  Courts. 
If 
it  was 
the"
"intention  the  draftsmen  of  the  Constitution  to  indicate  that  Article  61A"
"meant to confer immunity on the PSC, they could have used the marginal"
"note as they used in Article 35, namely, “[I]mmunity of … from suit” (“úreoaOj"
"kvq  mejrsh  fkdyels  nj”)  in  that  Article  as  well,  instead  of  the  marginal  note"
"that  has  commonly  been  used 
in  respect  of  other  public 
institutions"
"referred to above conferring with only an ouster of jurisdiction."
"If the Legislature intended to protect a person or a public body from"
"any  form  of  litigation,  such  objective  is  achieved  by  conferment  of  an"
"immunity on that entity by enactment of a positive provision of law to that"
"effect.  The  words  “…  no  civil  or  criminal  proceedings  shall  be  instituted  or"
"continued  …”, 
that  generally 
found 
in 
such  provisions 
that 
confer"
"immunity,  are  clear  in  what  they  mean.  In  must  also  be  noted  that  the"
"Article  61A,  however,  does  not  leave  the  Plaintiff  high  and  dry  without"
"34"
