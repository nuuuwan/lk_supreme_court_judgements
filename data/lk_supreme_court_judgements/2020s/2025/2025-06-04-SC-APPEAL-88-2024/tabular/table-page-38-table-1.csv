"S.C. Appeal No.88/3034"
"With the amended order of the AAT, both the decisions made by the"
"PSC, for which the Plaintiff claimed damages as decisions taken  mala fide,"
"were  rescinded  by  the  AAT.  In  the  absence  of  any  challenge  to  that"
"decision of the AAT on the part of the PSC, the legal validity of those two"
"decisions does not arise for consideration in these proceedings. However,"
"this fact becomes relevant in view of a particular contention advanced by"
"the Plaintiff."
