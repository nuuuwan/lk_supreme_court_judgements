"S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015"
"After having carefully perused the judgments of the High Court as well as"
"of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  I  am  of  the  firm  view  that  the  acceptance  of  Piyadasa’s"
"evidence  as  truthful  and  reliable  account  of  the  incident  during  which  his  son"
"suffered fatal injuries, could not be faulted as an erroneous decision."
"Moving on to the contention of the learned President’s Counsel for the 1st"
"and 2nd accused that the evidence presented by the prosecution failed to establish"
"the two of them were actuated by common murderous intention as, if at all, it has"
"to be formed at the spur of the moment, in the absence of a pre-arranged plan to"
"commit murder. Learned President’s Counsel for the 3rd accused also contended"
"that, in view of the admission made by the sole eyewitness that the involvement"
"of his client is restricted to calling out the name of the deceased and throwing a"
"piece of stick at him, and therefore imposition of criminal liability on the basis of"
"common  murderous  intention  by  the  High  Court  and  the  Court  of  Appeal,"
"affirming the said conviction are clearly erroneous decisions."
"In view of the contentions advanced by learned President’s Counsel for the"
"accused on imposition of criminal liability on the basis of Section 32 of the Penal"
"Code, it is convenient to consider the contention of the 1st and 2nd accused prior"
"to the consideration of the contention advanced on behalf of the 3rd accused."
"Learned High Court judge has relied on several items of evidence to satisfy"
"himself of the existence of a common murderous intention entertained by each of"
"the  three  accused  in  committing  the  murder  of  the  deceased.  These  items  of"
"evidence include the calling out the deceased by the 3rd accused, the place where"
"the attack on was carried out, the repeated use of a club to attack the deceased,"
"the manner in which multiple acts of stabbing were inflicted, the area of the body"
"19"
