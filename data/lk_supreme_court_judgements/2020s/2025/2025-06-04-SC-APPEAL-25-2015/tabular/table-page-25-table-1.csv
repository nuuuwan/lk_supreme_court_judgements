"S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015"
"created by the absence of any evidence as to the commencement of the attack is"
"filled by the medical evidence."
"It  is  the  opinion  of  the  medical  expert  that  injury  Nos.  1,2  and  3,  being"
"superficial  abrasions,  could  have  been  caused  by  pressing  the  blunt  end  of  a"
"pole/  club/stick  onto  the  skin  of  the  deceased,  but  quite  forcefully.  The  injury"
"No. 12, located in between shoulders, measured 22 inches in length and about 5"
"inches  in  its  width.  The  expert  witness  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  deceased"
"could have been assaulted with a club to cause that injury, repeatedly on almost"
"the same spot, causing that cluster of contusions. He was also of the opinion that"
"the  club,  produced  marked  “P1”,  if  used  for  about  four  or  five  times  to  assault"
"the  deceased,  could  have  caused  contusions,  in  the  manner  he  observed  on  the"
"body of the deceased."
"This  factor,  in  my  view  strongly  supports  the  role  of  all  three  accused  in"
"the attack on the deceased. The reason is that the deceased,  who was conscious"
"during the entire attack, would have tried to avoid being hit by the club. But the"
"several contusions  that are parallel to each other indicate that each blow by  the"
"club has landed on the same area of the body, because both the attacker and the"
"victim remained in the same positions throughout the attack using the club. This"
"is possible only if the deceased being held by others. The 1st and 2nd accused, who"
"only had knives with them, could not have assaulted the deceased with a single"
"club. They would have commenced their stabbing after the 3rd accused attacked"
"the deceased with a club."
"During  this  sustained  assault  with  a  club,  the  1st  and  2nd  accused  have"
"obviously held the deceased, facilitating the 3rd accused, to aim his blows to the"
"exact spot repeatedly, perhaps to weaken the deceased. The timing of the scream"
"25"
