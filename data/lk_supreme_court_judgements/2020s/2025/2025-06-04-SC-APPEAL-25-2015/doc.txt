The 1st and 2nd Accused-Appellants and the 3rd Accused-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the “1st , 2nd and 3rd accused” were indicted before the

High Court of Matara for committing the murder of Ganegoda Gamage Upali

Nishantha on 20.03.1998 at Denagama. The three accused opted for a trial without

a jury. The High Court, by its judgment pronounced on 16.10.2016, found the

three accused guilty of murder and imposed death sentence on them. The 1st and

2nd accused have preferred a joint appeal against their convictions while the 3rd

accused too preferred an appeal on his own by way of a separate petition of

appeal. Both these appeals were taken up for hearing before the Court of Appeal,

and by its judgment dated 11.12.2013, that Court proceeded to dismiss the

appeals after affirming the convictions and sentences imposed on the accused.

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

4

The 1st and 2nd accused sought special leave to appeal against the said

judgement of the Court of Appeal in SC Spl. LA No. 16 of 2014 whereas the 3rd

accused sought special leave to appeal in SC Spl. LA No. 15 of 2014. These two

applications were supported before this Court on 05.02.2014 and this Court was

pleased to grant special leave to appeal in SC Spl. LA No. 16 of 2014 (SC Appeal

No 14 of 2015) on following questions of law: –

a. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have failed to

analyse and evaluate the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution

and thereby the 1st and 2nd appellants have been deprived of a fair

trial?

b. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have misdirected

themselves when they held that the evidence led at the trial

disclosed a common murderous intention of the 1st and 2nd

appellants?

c. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have misdirected

themselves when they held that a common murderous intention was

formed on the spur of the moment considering the evidence led at

the trial?

In respect of SC Spl. LA No. 15 of 2014 (SC Appeal No 25 of 2015), special

leave to appeal was granted in respect of the following questions of law : –

d. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have misdirected

themselves when they held that the contradictions and omissions

marked in the evidence of Genegoda Gamage Piyadasa do not shake

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

5

the credibility of his evidence in as much as the contradictions go to

the root of the Prosecution case?

e. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have misdirected

themselves when they held that the evidence led at the trial

disclosed the 3rd appellant’s common murderous intention?

At the hearing of the two appeals before this Court on 16.07.2021, learned

President’s Counsel who represented 1st and 2nd accused, learned President’s

Counsel who represented the 3rd accused, as well as the learned Additional SG,

who represented the Attorney General, have consented to have these two

appeals amalgamated and pronouncement of a common judgment.

The contentions that were advanced by the learned President’s Counsel for

the accused before this Court were centred primarily on two grounds, as the

several questions of law on which leave was granted would indicate. While they

collectively challenged the acceptance of the evidence of the solitary eye witness

for the prosecution, as credible and reliable account of the incident, by both the

Courts below as an erroneous decision, learned President’s Counsel for the 1st

and 2nd accused further contended the fact there were altogether 12

contradictions and 4 omissions that were marked off the alleged eye witness’s

testimony in itself is sufficient to reject that evidence altogether as that witness

had demonstrably lied to Court and testified to an incident which he did not

witness.

While this contention was presented on the basis of an erroneous

assessment of the testimonial trustworthiness of the said eyewitness, in addition

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

6

learned President’s Counsel presented their other contention that it was upon on

erroneous imposition of criminal liability on the basis of sharing a common

murderous intention, that their clients were convicted, which, in view of the

evidence presented by the prosecution at the trial, appears to have formed on the

spur of the moment.

Learned President’s Counsel for the 3rd accused, particularly contended

that the evidence against his client is limited only to calling out the name of the

deceased person and throwing a stick at him at the end. He invited attention of

Court to the evidence of the eyewitness, who himself admits that the 3rd accused

did not cause any physical injury to the deceased and, contrary to the allegation

of a shared common murderous intention with other two, he actually acted as a

mediator by trying to diffuse the tense situation that had arisen earlier on that

evening.

In view of these submissions by learned Counsel, I now tun to the

evidence presented before the trial Court.

The deceased is the only son of the solitary eyewitness to the incident,

Ganegoda Gamage Piyadasa. The father and son operated a wayside boutique shop

built adjacent to their house, facing Matara – Walasmulla main road. The witness

Piyadasa lived in that house along with his wife, an unmarried daughter, and the

deceased son. The 1st and 2nd accused, who are brothers of the same family, lived

in the adjoining land. The 3rd accused also lived just across the street. The two

brothers and the 3rd accused are closely related to each other.

Referring to the sequence of events that culminated with the causing of the

death of the deceased, the witness Piyadasa said in his evidence that, in the

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

7

evening of 20.03.1998, his wife and daughter went out to a nearby house in order

to make a telephone call to their elder daughter who has just given birth. The

deceased has gone somewhere with his two-wheel tractor. Piyadasa was alone at

his boutique shop and, at about 5.30 p.m., the 1st accused, the 2nd accused, and his

wife have walked into that shop. Both the 1st and 2nd accused appeared to be

under the influence of liquor. The 1st accused, having walked up to the cashier’s

table where Piyadasa was standing, abused him for about five minutes and

threatened that both of them will be killed. He also attempted to smash up some

glass bottles on the floor. The 2nd accused, who was also with his brother,

however remained silent during this episode. The witness also observed a knife,

kept by the 2nd accused in his trouser pocket. After some time, the three of them

have left without causing any further trouble to the witness.

After about a half an hour since the three of them left, the deceased

returned to the boutique shop in his tractor, carrying a load of cement bricks.

Having parked the vehicle in front of the boutique, the deceased went into the

house, by walking through the shop. At that time, Piyadasa was serving two of

his customers and did not disclose the incident involving the 1st and 2nd accused

to his son. After a few minutes, Piyadasa saw the three accused walking past his

shop and continuing towards his house. He then heard the 3rd accused calling

out to the deceased “ u,a,S" u,a,S,”. He also heard the deceased shouting “nqÿ wïfu`”.

That sound came from the direction of his house. Since Piyadasa was serving one

of his customers at that time, after hearing the cries of his son, he looked through

the rear window of the shop, but could not see what was happening. He then ran

out of the shop through its rear door and saw the 1st and 2nd accused stabbing the

deceased.

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

8

The two accused, after having pinned the deceased to the earth

embankment at the rear of the house, were stabbing him. The witness described

the manner in which the two accused stabbed his son, as if the two accused

stabbed were in a contest (;rfÕg wekakd). He also said in evidence that he did not

count the number of stabs each accused has inflicted.

As Piyadasa rushed in shouting that his son is being stabbed and then the

deceased started running towards him. He was bleeding profusely from his

injuries. At that point, the 3rd accused threw a piece of stick at the running

deceased, on which he tripped over and fell on the ground face down. The 1st

accused thereafter stabbed the deceased once more on the back of his torso

(fldkao) and tried to lift him with the knife still inside the body. Thereafter, the

two accused have turned towards the witness threatening him that he too would

be ‘finished’ ( f;` bjr lrkjd). Thereafter, the three accused have dispersed and

the witness drove the tractor to bring his wife. Having met her and, after briefly

describing that the 1st and 2nd accused had “finished” their son, drove back to

taken the deceased to the hospital. On his way, Piyadasa met the 1st accused

coming in the opposite direction driving his car. The two vehicles met over a

culvert and when the 1st accused brandished his knife, Piyadasa ran off, leaving

his tractor in the middle of the road.

After transporting the deceased to the hospital, the witness complained of

the incident to Hakmana Police Station at about 7.30 p.m.

It is from this narrative provided by Piyadasa during the trial, the accused

were able to mark several contradictions and omissions, to which they invited

attention of this Court, in support of their contention that the High Court as well

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

9

as the Court of Appeal erred in its failure to afford them the benefit of doubt that

arise in the prosecution case due to them.

In these circumstances, it is incumbent upon on this Court to consider the

multiple contradictions and omissions that were particularly highlighted by the

learned President’s Counsel before this Court, along with the suggestions made

to the witness during cross examination, in order to consider the determination

made by the Courts below on the question whether the eye witness testimony is

a credible and reliable account of the incident, in the light of applicable principles

of law.

Of the multiple inconsistencies that were highlighted before the High

Court, learned President’s Counsel invited our attention to a set of

contradictions, forming the contradictions marked as “V1” to “V4”. These

inconsistencies relates to Piyadasa’s denial of stating to the police that the 1st

accused was abusing them from his house and the deceased has questioned the

reason for the said verbal assault (“V1”), denial of stating to police that the

deceased, by responding to the 1st accused’s verbal assault, said that they (the

accused) were harassing them for over 10 years and having assaulted Piyadasa,

they broke his shoulder (“V2”), denied of having stated at the inquest that the

deceased has questioned the 1st accused, why they continue to harass them for

over a period of 10 years (“V4”), denial of stating to police that the deceased had

a piece of stick in his hand and the 3rd accused told him to put that away (“V3”),

and were relied on by Counsel, in support of their aforesaid contention.

The effect of these inconsistencies, that arise out from the contents of the

statement made to police by Piyadasa and his testimony in the inquest, is that

the witness has made an attempt to downplay of any form of involvement on the

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

10

part of the deceased that could be construed as a contributory factor in the

escalation of the situation, that eventually lead to his death. If what Piyadasa said

in his statement is true, then, not only did he suppress the fact that his son’s

questioning of the 1st accused during his verbal assault, but also suppressed the

fact that the deceased had a piece of a stick in his hand. Similarly, Piyadasa has

also suppressed the fact that he too was assaulted by the accused and broke his

shoulder, along with the fact that the 1st and 2nd accused, have continuously

harassed them for no apparent reason for over a period of ten years.

The evidence of Piyadasa is that he made his statement to police soon after

he brought the deceased to the hospital, which point he was pronounced dead.

Naturally Piyadasa would have been distraught with the death of his only son

and in that mental state he has made the statement. Similarly, the inquest was

held on the following day, and even before the last rites of the deceased was

performed. Irrespective of the mental state of the witness at the time of making

the statement, the fact remained that he has made reference in that statement to

the fact that his son has enquired from the 1st accused, who was abusing them

even at that point of time, for a reason for their continuous harassment. He also

mentioned to the police of the fact that the deceased also had a piece of stick in

his hand, when he made enquiries from the 1st accused. These factors needed to

be considered in the light of the submissions made by the learned President’s

Counsel for the 3rd accused, who contended that the deliberate act on the part of

Piyadasa in the suppression of the ‘genesis’ of the incident, which ought to be

taken as a factor that casts a doubt on its acceptability as a truthful account.

Piyadasa, being an obviously interested witness, and for some unexplained

reason, has failed to divulge these details before the High Court and denied

having stated so to the police. However, it must also be noted that there are no

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

11

contradictions on any of these points marked through his testimony during the

non-summary proceedings as all of them relates to inconsistencies with his police

statement and his evidence at the inquest. This particular factor was noted by the

learned High Court Judge and considered and taken note during his evaluation

of the evidence of the sole eyewitness.

Except for the evidence that the 1st and 2nd accused have threatened

Piyadasa and his son with death, just half an hour before the actual stabbing has

taken place, the prosecution evidence makes no reference to any long-standing

enmity on the part of any of the accused. Considered in this light, the

suppression of the ‘genesis’ of the attack, as contended by the learned President’s

Counsel for the 3rd accused, has effectively denied the prosecution of any

evidence regarding this important factor. The only evidence is the threats issued

by the 1st and 2nd accused when they came into the shop earlier on, in the same

evening. In fact, the High Court has considered the contents of these highlighted

portions of the statement of Piyadasa that were presented before it as

contradictory statements, in spite of the fact that they could not be considered as

‘evidence’, in order to arrive at a finding whether there was a sudden fight that

erupted between the accused and the deceased.

In the light of the submissions made by Counsel, what should be

considered by this Court is whether the Courts below have erred in law by

accepting Piyadasa as a truthful and credible witness owing to these

inconsistencies.

The judgment of The Queen v Julis (1963) 65 NLR 505, reveals that one of

the questions presented before the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination

was, in a situation where two of the prosecution witnesses have admitted they

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

12

falsely implicated an accused, whether it was still open to the jury to act on their

evidence against the other accused. Basnayake CJ, after referring to the maxim;

falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, observed that ( at p. 519) “[I]n applying this maxim

it must be remembered that all falsehood is not deliberate. Errors of memory, faulty

observation or lack of skill in observation upon any point or points, exaggeration, or mere

embroidery or embellishment, must be distinguished from deliberate falsehood.” Thus,

even in an instance where a witness has admittedly lied under oath, his

testimony need not be blindly and automatically rejected for that reason alone.

Before a witness is found to have uttered a deliberate falsehood, the trier of fact

should consider whether any of the factors that referred to by Basnayaka CJ, have

contributed to the situation and then to arrive at a finding on the credibility of

that witness. That being the consistent approach adopted by the superior Courts

in dealing with a witness who uttered a falsehood under oath, in relation to

dealing with inconsistencies of an average witness’s testimony, who only denied

having stated something different, that do not affect the core of his primary

narrative, need not be given much of a significance, especially when that

narrative satisfies the test of probabilities.

In this context, it is relevant to consider at this point of the effect of the

three omissions that were marked off the evidence of Piyadasa on his credibility.

During cross-examination of the 1st and 2nd accused, Piyadasa admitted that the

incident of stabbing commenced with the deceased crying out loudly “ nqÿ wïfu`”,

which in turn had alerted the witness to rush out of his shop to investigate. The

witness failed to mention this fact in his police statement, in the inquest

proceedings or in the non-summary proceedings. Clearly, the assertion that

Piyadasa heard the cries of his son was presented in the High Court for the first

time, and that too after a lapse of nine years.

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

13

Perusal of the evidence of Piyadasa in its entirety, reveals that the said

witness also stated that, upon seeing the incident of stabbing, he shouted “nqÿ

wïfu`”. He also shouted that my son is being stabbed. According to the witness

the entire incident of stabbing has taken less than five minutes. This indicates the

words “nqÿ wïfu`” has featured in the evidence quite regularly, not as an item of

evidence that has been introduced into the narrative belatedly, but as a natural

reaction to the situation being unfolded before the witness.

The inconsistencies and omissions are, as it was submitted, in respect of

the ‘genesis’ of the incident. The narrative of the incident including what he saw

and did during the incident and its immediate aftermath is, according to learned

High Court Judge, is corroborated by other evidence.

This Court, in Dharmasiri v Republic of Sri Lanka (2012) 1 Sri L.R. 268,

was called upon to consider the issue whether the mere belatedness and failure

of the 1st witness to name the appellant in his statement, under the given

circumstances, does not render the witness's evidence unreliable or lacking in

testimonial creditworthiness; or the presence at the incident of the 1st and 2nd

eyewitnesses is doubtful. In answering the said issue in the affirmative, this

Court quoted a pronouncement made by Jayasuriya J, in Banda and Others v

Attorney General (1999) 3 Sri L.R. 168 (at p. 172) to the effect that “ [O]missions do

not stand in the same position as contradictions and discrepancies. Thus, the rule in

regard to consistency and inconsistency is not strictly applicable to omissions”, with

approval (at p. 277). Consideration of relative probabilities of the deceased

screaming “nqÿ wïfu`”, it need not be emphasised here that the said act attributed

to the deceased is clearly a natural reaction of a person, who was placed in such a

situation. This reasoning is further strengthened when the number of stabs and

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

14

blunt trauma injuries the deceased has sustained within an interval of few

minutes.

In the instant appeal too, in view of the circumstances under which the

witness made statements to police and given evidence at the inquest, his failure

to state that there was some reaction on the part of the deceased in his evidence,

does not support a conclusion that his evidence should be rejected on the

premise that he uttered a deliberate falsehood for denying that he stated so to the

investigators in those instances. This view is further strengthened by the fact that

the witness was neither questioned whether such an incident (the verbal

interaction of the deceased) never happened, nor was he questioned that he

stated so, in order to falsely implicate the accused to a crime they did not

commit. In this regard it is relevant to consider the suggestions put to the witness

by the three accused.

When the 1st and 2nd accused suggested to Piyadasa that he did not witness

the incident of stabbing, his replied that what he disclosed before Court was

what he saw with his own eyes. Similarly, when the 3rd accused also suggested

that he has given evidence on an incident which he himself imagined of, the

witness replied what he says now is exactly what he saw. The 3rd accused further

suggested to the witness that he did not see the assault by a stick, but the witness

asserted that it is a true fact.

It is to be expected that, Piyadasa, being the only eyewitness, asserting in

his evidence that he witnessed the incident of stabbing and the accused’s making

every attempt to challenge this claim. However, the suggestion put to Piyadasa

that he was not there at the scene is reduced to a mere proposition, when one

considers the fact that he operates a boutique shop for living. It is clear from the

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

15

police observations the incident of stabbing has taken place in front of the house

and close to the rear of the shop building. Piyadasa said in his evidence when he

heard cries of his son, which alerted him of the stabbing, while he was serving a

customer. If the shop was kept open, in fact it was, and with his wife being away,

it is undisputable that Piyadasa obviously remained there and therefore has

witnessed the incident by which the deceased came by his death.

The High Court has devoted significant space in its judgment to consider

the effect of these several inconsistencies and omissions, in assessing the

testimonial trustworthiness of the sole eyewitness for the prosecution. That

Court, in justifying its decision to accept Piyadasa’s evidence, concluded that

there was no reason, either apparent from the evidence presented before it or

from the suggestions put to the witness, that he falsely implicated any of the

three accused to the incident of stabbing. Thus, these suggestions put to the

witness has made no impact on his trustworthiness at all.

It is also to be noted that it was same trial Judge, who commenced the trial

and continued to preside over the trial, until its conclusion at which point that

the three accused were found guilty to the charge of murder. Learned High

Court Judge, having observed the demeanour deportment of the eyewitness,

particularly during cross- examination, has decided to accept his evidence as

credible and reliable account of the incident.

Hence, the opinion formed by the learned trial Judge upon consideration

of the demeanour and deportment of the only eyewitness in the witness box, is

entitled to be given its due weightage in the determination of the credibility of a

witness, essentially of being a question of fact.

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

16

It is noted earlier on that the High Court, in determining to accept

Piyadasa’s evidence as credible, found it corroborated by independent medical

evidence. The evidence is that the 1st and 2nd accused have stabbed the deceased,

as if there was a contest and, when the witness saw the stabbing, his son was

facing him while the two accused were facing the deceased. The medical

evidence reveals that the deceased suffered altogether 35 external injuries. Of

these injuries, there were 20 stab injuries that penetrated into the plural cavity of

the deceased, coupled with corresponding internal injuries to the larynx, lungs,

heart, liver and kidneys. According to the JMO, injury Nos. 5,6,7,9,10,11,23,26

and 24 were necessarily fatal injuries and it is highly unlikely that the deceased

would survive even for half an hour.

What is relevant in the present context is the fact that there were 12 stab

injuries observed by the JMO, on the front of the deceased’s chest area, and

thereby amply supporting the witness’s claim that he saw repeated acts of

stabbing by the 1st and 2nd accused, when the deceased was facing him. The

medical evidence also supports the witness’s claim that he saw the 1st accused

stabbing the deceased on his torso ( fldkao), after he tripped himself over a piece

of stick, that was thrown at him by the 3rd accused and fallen on the ground.

Injury No. 10 was located at the back of his chest, near the spinal cord and

penetrated into the abdominal cavity to cause a one-inch-long injury on the left

kidney of the deceased. Injury No. 30, a minor injury seen on the right knee of

the deceased, and injury No. 10, clearly supports the witness’s claim that the

deceased fell down while attempting to run away from his assailants and was

stabbed on his torso.

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

17

In addition, the conduct of the witness upon being threatened with a knife

near the culvert, is corroborative of conduct of a person who witnessed a

gruesome attack on a loved one. Piyadasa said in his evidence that on his way

back; after informing his wife of the stabbing, he met the 1st accused coming in

the opposite direction in a car and he stopped his tractor near a culvert and fled.

The fact that the witness’s tractor was found near the culvert is confirmed by his

wife, who walked pass it and by the police, as there was heavy traffic built up

caused by the tractor that had stalled on the middle of the road near a culvert.

What made Piyadasa to flee in such an unusual manner from the 1st

accused, who merely showed him a knife, whilst seated in his car?

The conduct of Piyadasa in this instance is quite unusual when compared

with another average person, who was threatened in a similar fashion and

qualified to be taken as an over-reaction. However, Piyadasa’s said conduct could

be understood, only if one considers the perspective of what he has witnessed a

few minutes before. This is a person whose only son was brutally stabbed to

death by the 1st and 2nd accused before his own eyes. The death threat issued by

the 1st accused, after coming into the shop, early in the evening became a reality

when the 1st and 2nd accused have stabbed the deceased to death. Piyadasa by

then believed for certain that his life too is under a serious threat. When Piyadasa

saw the 1st accused for the second time near the culvert with a knife, irrespective

of the latter’s restricted mobility to act immediately while being seated in a car,

but after having witnessed the manner in which his son was stabbed, he was not

prepared to take any chances. Thus, Piyadasa left his tractor on the middle of the

road and fled away from what he perceived as an imminent threat to his life.

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

18

In appeal, the three accused have apparently placed heavy reliance on the

ground of appeal that the trial Court has fallen into grave error when it decided

to accept Piyadasa’s evidence as credible evidence. The Court of Appeal, after

considering the process of evaluation of the testimonial trustworthiness of

Piyadasa undertaken by the High Court and after making a detailed references to

each of these inconsistencies, has arrived at the conclusion that the learned trial

Judge made no error in the determination of the said question of fact. In

considering the said ground of appeal, the Court of Appeal has guided itself

from the reasoning of the judgment by the Supreme Court of India in Uttar

Pradesh v M.K. Anthony AIR (1985) SC 48, where an approach, similar to the one

taken in the above cited local judicial precedents, was adopted. The apex Court

of India stated that:

“Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case,

hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or

there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error

committed by the investigating officer not going to the root of the matter

would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. … Even

honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some details unrelated to the

main incident because power of observation, retention and reproduction

differ with individuals”.

In Veerasamy Sivathasan v Attorney General (SC Appeal 208/2012 –

decided on 15.12.2021) and Chamila Perera v Republic of Sri Lanka (SC Appeal

No. 171/2012 – decided on 04.11.2024), this Court made references to the above

reproduced segment of the judgment of Court in Uttar Pradesh v M.K. Anthony

(ibid) .

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

19

After having carefully perused the judgments of the High Court as well as

of the Court of Appeal, I am of the firm view that the acceptance of Piyadasa’s

evidence as truthful and reliable account of the incident during which his son

suffered fatal injuries, could not be faulted as an erroneous decision.

Moving on to the contention of the learned President’s Counsel for the 1st

and 2nd accused that the evidence presented by the prosecution failed to establish

the two of them were actuated by common murderous intention as, if at all, it has

to be formed at the spur of the moment, in the absence of a pre-arranged plan to

commit murder. Learned President’s Counsel for the 3rd accused also contended

that, in view of the admission made by the sole eyewitness that the involvement

of his client is restricted to calling out the name of the deceased and throwing a

piece of stick at him, and therefore imposition of criminal liability on the basis of

common murderous intention by the High Court and the Court of Appeal,

affirming the said conviction are clearly erroneous decisions.

In view of the contentions advanced by learned President’s Counsel for the

accused on imposition of criminal liability on the basis of Section 32 of the Penal

Code, it is convenient to consider the contention of the 1st and 2nd accused prior

to the consideration of the contention advanced on behalf of the 3rd accused.

Learned High Court judge has relied on several items of evidence to satisfy

himself of the existence of a common murderous intention entertained by each of

the three accused in committing the murder of the deceased. These items of

evidence include the calling out the deceased by the 3rd accused, the place where

the attack on was carried out, the repeated use of a club to attack the deceased,

the manner in which multiple acts of stabbing were inflicted, the area of the body

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

20

which had the greatest number of stab injuries, coupled with the evidence of

subsequent conduct of the accused, particularly of the 1st accused.

The Court of Appeal considered the contention, presented before it by the

learned President’s Counsel for the 3rd accused that he did not share a common

murderous intention with the other two accused. It appears from the judgment

of that Court that neither the 1st and 2nd accused have presented a ground of

appeal based on common intention nor raised same in their joint petition of

appeal. In relation to the 1st and 3rd accused, the only ground considered by that

Court was the correctness of the assessment made by the High Court on

testimonial trustworthiness of Piyadasa.

In view of the questions of law on which this appeal was argued on, it is

necessary to devote some space in this judgment to consider this aspect in a more

detailed manner.

The evidence is clear that there was some animosity entertained by the 1st

and 2nd accused against the deceased and his father. Judging by their conduct, it

supports an inference that the said animosity was directed mostly towards the

deceased. Having had the opportunity to cause bodily harm to Piyadasa inside

his shop, the 1st and 2nd accused have resisted that temptation and have

withdrawn after issuing only death threats. When the deceased returned home

after about half an hour later, the situation changed drastically. Instead of the

two accused, who came earlier on, the 3rd accused also joined them, in search of

the deceased after seeing him returning home.

It was the 3rd accused who called out for the deceased “u,a,S" u,a,S” and

lured the latter out of his house. Then the attack on him commenced without a

warning and the deceased cried “nqÿ wïfu`”. The 1st and 2nd accused have

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

21

repeatedly stabbed the deceased mostly on his chest and chased after him

shouting “f;` bjr lrkjd” when the latter made an attempt to escape them. The 1st

accused stabbed the deceased once more while Piyadasa shouted “nqÿ wïfu`”. After a

while the 1st accused threatened Piyadasa once again near a culvert, making him

to flee after abandoning his tractor on the road.

The repeated acts of stabbing clearly justify an inference that there was a

prearranged plan of the accused as the two accused lost no time when the

deceased emerged out of his house to spring into action and, within a matter of

less than five minutes, have inflicted multiple deep stab and cut injuries, totalling

to almost 30 injuries, resulting in his death. The murderous intention entertained

by the persons who stabbed the deceased is easily established. It is the common

meeting of the minds of the two that is disputed before us, but the evidence,

taken in its totality, is clearly supportive of the conclusions reach on that point by

both Courts below. Hence, I am of the view that the said conclusion is well

supported by the evidence and in line with the applicable principles of law.

The High Court, after considering the evidence against the 3rd accused,

formed the view that his involvement with the incident was not to save the

deceased from attack but to contribute to the attack and has acted according to a

pre-arranged plan along with the other two accused. The Court of Appeal, in

affirming the conviction of the 3rd accused to the count of murder, has itemised

the evidence against him and considered them in the appliable principles on

Section 32 of the Penal Code. It then proceeded to reach the conclusion that the

evidence has established that the 3rd accused shared a common murderous

intention with the others. The appellate Court further added that “ … common

intention can come into existence without pre-arrangement. It can be formed on the spur

of the moment”

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

22

In limiting the complicity of the 3rd accused to the murder of the deceased,

learned President’s Counsel has relied strongly on the admission of Piyadasa that

he only heard him calling out “u,a,S" u,a,S” and saw him throwing a piece of club

at the deceased. Learned Counsel further submitted that the role played by the

3rd accused in the incident was therefore more akin to that of a mediator, who

tried to bring about a settlement between the two fighting parties. Hence, learned

Counsel argued that the prosecution, in these circumstances, has totally failed to

establish beyond reasonable doubt that the 3rd accused shared a common

murderous intention with the other two and, on that account alone, he ought to

have been acquitted from the count of murder.

In dealing with the contention that the 3rd accused was merely acting as a

mediator, it must be noted that the said position was taken up for the first time

before the Court of Appeal, except for a mentioning that before the trial Court in

passing, by a question put to Piyadasa. Learned Counsel who represented the 3rd

accused before the High Court, merely asked Piyadasa for his opinion, whether

the 3rd accused came there to mediate. The witness denied this indirect

suggestion with an emphatic denial and proceeded to clarify his answer by

clearly implicating the 3rd accused as the person who lured the deceased out

from his house by calling out “u,a,S" u,a,S”. The 3rd accused did not take up the

position that he was merely trying to mediate at that point in time, during his

statement made from the dock. Except for registering the denial of attacking the

deceased with a club, as he was somewhere else when the incident happened,

the 3rd accused’s only other claim made in his dock statement was Piyadasa’s

accusation against him is totally a lie.

When the sequence of events, as narrated by Piyadasa, is examined

carefully in its entirety, it could be observed that he did not claim to have

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

23

witnessed the point at which the attack on his son had commenced. The witness

only saw the three accused were walking past his shop. Within minutes he heard

the 3rd accused calling out for the deceased. Piyadasa heard the 3rd accused call

“u,a,S" u,a,S” from the direction of his house, just outside the rear entrance of his

shop, while attending to one of his customers. He became alarmed of the attack

and ran towards the back of his shop, only when he heard the deceased crying

out “nqÿ wïfu`”. What he saw at that point of time was the 1st and 2nd accused

were stabbing his son, as if they had a contest. The witness also saw the 3rd

accused stood by in the vicinity. When the deceased started running towards the

witness only the 3rd accused sprang into action. The 3rd accused, having picked

up a piece of a club/stick, threw it at the running deceased, who suffered

multiple stab injuries. The 1st and 2nd accused too were chasing after the

deceased. They shouted that the deceased that he would be finished off ( f;` bjr

lrkjd). The flying piece of club/stick, which the 3rd accused threw at the

deceased, hit one of the legs of the deceased. After tripping over that piece of

wood, the deceased fell on the ground. It was at that point the 1st accused has

stabbed the deceased on his torso, for the last time.

The totality of the evidence of the eyewitness is considered, it is reasonable

to conclude that the role played by the 3rd accused in this incident, is far from

being an innocent neighbour who intervened to mediate between two parties, or

an innocent bystander who happened to go past, but stopped to witness the

incident, but more of a co-conspirator, who acted on a pre-arranged plan,

intervening at the correct time. The 1st and 2nd accused had ample opportunity to

mount an attack on the witness when they abused him inside the shop. The

witness was alone and at least the 2nd accused had a knife with him. But for some

reason they did not. The fact that, prior to the incident of stabbing, the 1st and 2nd

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

24

accused have limited their actions only to a verbal abuse against Piyadasa,

supports the inference that their target in fact was the deceased and not the

witness.

Piyadasa admitted that the 3rd accused had no prior history of animosity

towards the deceased. If not for the act of the 3rd accused in calling out “u,a,S"

u,a,S”, the deceased would not have walked out of his house, given the animosity

that exists between him and the 1st and 2nd accused, and thereby exposed himself

to a great danger. By answering the call made by the 3rd accused, the deceased

has unsuspectingly exposed himself to a mortal danger. Piyadasa’s evidence is

clear on this aspect.

In the preceding part, whilst dealing with the common murderous

intention entertained by the 1st and 2nd accused, I have concluded that the two of

them lost no time when the deceased emerged out of his house to spring into

action and, within a matter of less than five minutes, have inflicted multiple deep

stab and cut injuries, totalling to almost 30 injuries. Since the 1st and 2nd accused

chased after the deceased, who started to run by stating “f;` bjr lrkjd ”, the 3rd

accused effectively prevented the heavily injured deceased, who was bleeding

profusely, from escaping his assailants, by throwing a piece of club at his legs. It

could be a co-incident that the deceased had tripped over it and fell down. But

the intention of the 3rd accused is clear that he wished to facilitate the other two

of their avowed tasks of finishing the deceased off.

Now I wish to deal with the admission made by Piyadasa limiting the role

played by the 3rd accused to calling out the deceased and throwing a stick at him.

It is already noted the number of injuries the deceased has suffered that resulted

in his death and Piyadasa only saw the latter part of the stabbing. The void

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

25

created by the absence of any evidence as to the commencement of the attack is

filled by the medical evidence.

It is the opinion of the medical expert that injury Nos. 1,2 and 3, being

superficial abrasions, could have been caused by pressing the blunt end of a

pole/ club/stick onto the skin of the deceased, but quite forcefully. The injury

No. 12, located in between shoulders, measured 22 inches in length and about 5

inches in its width. The expert witness was of the opinion that the deceased

could have been assaulted with a club to cause that injury, repeatedly on almost

the same spot, causing that cluster of contusions. He was also of the opinion that

the club, produced marked “P1”, if used for about four or five times to assault

the deceased, could have caused contusions, in the manner he observed on the

body of the deceased.

This factor, in my view strongly supports the role of all three accused in

the attack on the deceased. The reason is that the deceased, who was conscious

during the entire attack, would have tried to avoid being hit by the club. But the

several contusions that are parallel to each other indicate that each blow by the

club has landed on the same area of the body, because both the attacker and the

victim remained in the same positions throughout the attack using the club. This

is possible only if the deceased being held by others. The 1st and 2nd accused, who

only had knives with them, could not have assaulted the deceased with a single

club. They would have commenced their stabbing after the 3rd accused attacked

the deceased with a club.

During this sustained assault with a club, the 1st and 2nd accused have

obviously held the deceased, facilitating the 3rd accused, to aim his blows to the

exact spot repeatedly, perhaps to weaken the deceased. The timing of the scream

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

26

“ nqÿ wïfu`”, when considered in this perspective, coincide perfectly with this

attack. In this respect, it is very relevant to note that the expert witness has

further opined that it could well be that the deceased was assaulted with a club

during the initial stages of the attack, before being repeatedly stabbed. He further

stated that similarly it is more likely that several persons were involved with the

attack on the deceased. The JMO, who performed the post mortem examination

on the body of the deceased, has already performed over 1000 such examinations

and his opinions, based on scientific knowledge and experience, could

undoubtedly assisted the trial Court as well as the appellate Court, in the

determination of the guilt or innocence of the three accused on the charge

levelled against them.

In spite of the strong prima facie case being established against the 3rd

accused by the prosecution, he offered no explanation in his dock statement, at

least by stating why he came along with the other two accused in search of the

deceased. If the 3rd accused’s involvement is that of a mediator, as he now trying

to portray for himself, it could have presented for the consideration of the trial

Court. Thus, the presumptive evidence presented against him by the prosecution

through the eyewitness testimony became conclusive on his complicity in the

murder.

In view of these considerations, I answer the questions of law in SC Appeal No.

14 of 2015 are as follows:

a. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have failed to

analyse and evaluate the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution

and thereby the 1st and 2nd appellants have been deprived of a fair

trial? No.

S.C. Appeal No. 25/2015

27

b. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have misdirected

themselves when they held that the evidence led at the trial

disclosed a common murderous intention of the 1st and 2nd

appellants? No.

c. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have misdirected

themselves when they held that a common murderous intention was

formed on the spur of the moment considering the evidence led at

the trial ? No. There was pre-arranged plan.

The questions of law of SC Appeal No 25 of 2015 are answered as follows :

d. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have misdirected

themselves when they held that the contradictions and omissions

marked in the evidence of Genegoda Gamage Piyadasa do not shake

the credibility of his evidence in as much as the contradictions go to

the root of the Prosecution case? No.

e. Whether the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal have misdirected

themselves when they held that the evidence led at the trial

disclosed the 3rd appellant’s common murderous intention? No.

In view of the answers to the questions of law on which the two appeals

were heard, I affirm the judgment of the High Court convicting the three accused

for murder the sentences of death imposed on them along with the judgment of

the Court of Appeal in dismissing their appeals.
