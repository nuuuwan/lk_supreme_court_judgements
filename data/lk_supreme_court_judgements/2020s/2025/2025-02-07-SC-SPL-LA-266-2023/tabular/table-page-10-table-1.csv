"Order of Court"
"We have considered the sequence of events that transpired consequent to the issuance"
"of the Writ of Certiorari by the Court of Appeal and note with disdain, the steps taken by the"
"Respondents  namely,  the  Ceylon  Petroleum  Corporation,  the  Directors  and  the  Minister  to"
"enter into a fresh Dealership Agreement with the Petitioner, prior to even the Special Leave"
"to Appeal Application filed by the Petitioner was supported for granting of leave before the"
"Supreme Court."
"We are concerned with the speed at which the events have unfolded to grant a new"
"dealership to the Petitioner in the backdrop of invoking the jurisdiction of this Court by the"
"Petitioner."
"We are mindful that when the approval was granted by the Board of Directors of the"
"CPC on 15th November, 2023 that the guidelines pertaining to ‘minimum distance’ was still"
"in operation. (vide X6, annexed to the affidavit of the Managing Director the 3A Respondent"
"dated 21-03-2024) and that the CPC granted the go-ahead for the Petitioner’s fresh application,"
"within one month from the date of the Court of Appeal judgement, when the Petitioner had"
"filed an application for Special Leave to Appeal against the very same judgement."
"We also note that the CPC did not file a Special Leave to Appeal Application and the"
"Hon. Attorney General, being the Counsel for the CPC has advised the CPC that this is not a"
"fit and proper case to file appeal papers on behalf of the CPC."
"This  Court  further  observes,  that  though  by  letter  dated  08-12-2023  the  Secretary,"
"Ministry of Power and Energy had been informed that the Petitioner was granted approval to"
"commence  business  operations  on  12-12-2023,  (vide  X10,  annexed  to  3A  Respondent’s"
"further affidavit dated 29-04-2024), the Board approval did not refer to a date to commence"
"business."
"Moreover, when the Petitioner filed before this Court a motion, dated 12-02-2024 to"
"withdraw the Special Leave to Appeal application, the Petitioner failed to appraise this Court"
"and/or deliberality withheld from Court, that a new Dealership Agreement had already been"
"signed  between  the  Petitioner  and  the  CPC  on  12-12-2023  and  that  the  Petitioner  had"
"commenced  business  operations.  This  amply  demonstrate  the  Petitioner’s  conduct  and  the"
"willingness and the eagerness of the CPC to grant the license to the Petitioner at its earliest."
"This Court is very much mindful of the “strictures passed by the judges of the Court of"
"Appeal” in relation to the decision taken by the Respondents the CPC, its Directors and the"
"Minister to grant a dealership to the present Petitioner, B.S. Coorey and the issuance of the"
"license  being  decisions  tainted  with  bias  and  secondly,  the  failure  of  the  Respondents  to"
"consider  relevant  factors  at  the  first  instance,  in  the  issuance  of  a  new  Dealership  to  the"
"Petitioners which were the key arears challenged and adjudicated before the Court of Appeal"
"in the Writ application where writ of certiorari was issued."
"This Court abhors the above conduct of the Petitioner and the Respondents, the CPC,"
"its Directors and the Minister."
"This  Court  firmly  believes  and  advocates,  that  adherence  to  judicial  orders  and"
"directives is a basic norm in a just society. It is the foundation of the Rule of Law. The conduct"
