"-","that  the  arbitrary  instructions  given  by  the  9A  Respondent-Respondent  (“the"
"","Minister”)  at  the  meeting  held  on  12-09-2023  (within  4  working  days  after  the"

"-","the CPC has the authority to remove the minimum distance requirement, but such"
"","discretion must be expressed lawfully and in deference to procedural propriety;"
"-","hence  the  instructions  issued  by  the  Minister  in  an  arbitrary,  capricious  and"
"","egregious manner as reflected in X1, tantamount to contempt of the judgement of"

"-","even if a policy decision was made for change of rules, the CPC and the Minister"
"","ought to have adopted a process, wherein a rational and a data driven requirement"
"","was properly maintained and the failure to follow such process indicate the mala"
