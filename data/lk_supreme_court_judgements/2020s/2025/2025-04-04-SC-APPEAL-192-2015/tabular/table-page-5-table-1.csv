"It is also clear that the assessment No. 149 referred to in Case No. 8448/RE"
"is the ground floor,  and the assessment  No. 147/1/8,  which is the subject"
"matter of the Case No. 8449/RE, is the upper floor of assessment No. 149."
"This in effect shows that the action has been in relation to one building with"
"two assessment numbers."
"It appears from the case record that the 1st defendant has not taken part in"
"the case, and it was the 2nd defendant who has contested the action initiated"
"by the plaintiff.  Although there had been no admission recorded, it is clear"
"that both the assessment numbers had been occupied by the 2nd defendant."
"At the trial, the 2nd defendant has only formulated one issue on the basis that"
"the  District  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  to  hear  and  determine  the  cases,  for"
"which the learned District Judge has answered considering it as a preliminary"
"issue. It had been determined that the Court has jurisdiction."
"It  appears  that  the  position  taken  up  by  the  2nd  defendant  at  the  trial  had"
"been that he is not the sub-tenant of the 1st defendant, but a tenant under"
"the  plaintiff.  Since  it  has  been  claimed  by  the  2nd  defendant  that  the  sub-"
"tenancy  agreement  relied  on  by  the  plaintiff  was  a  fraudulent  document,  it"
"has been referred to the Examiner of the Questioned Document (EQD) where"
"it has been opined by the EQD that, in fact, the signatures in the said sub-"
"tenancy agreement belongs to the 2nd defendant."
"At the trial before the District Court, it had been the brother of the plaintiff"
"who has given evidence on behalf of him. He has stated that since his brother"
"and other family members are undereducated, it is he who looked after the"
"property in question. He has produced the agreement marked P-01 where the"
"plaintiff has let the premises No. 149, Maliban Street, Colombo 11 to the 1st"
"defendant on rent. It has been his evidence that subsequent to the agreement"
"marked P-01, since the 1st defendant requested the upper floor of the building"
"which bears the assessment No. 147/1/8 also on rent, it too was given to him"
"although no written agreement was executed in that regard."
