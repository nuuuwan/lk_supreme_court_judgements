"He  lamented  that  the  plaintiff  not  giving  evidence  in  the  case  cannot  be"
"considered as a valid reason to undermine the evidence led on behalf of the"
"plaintiff, which has proved the case on the balance of probability against the"
"two defendants. On that basis, he pleaded that the appeals should be allowed."
"When  considering  the  two  appellate  judgments  pronounced  by  the  learned"
"High  Court  Judges  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  the  Western  Province"
"holden in Colombo, it is clear that the judgment of the learned District Judge"
"of  Colombo  has  been  set  aside  for  similar  reasons.  It  has  been  determined"
"that the plaintiff has failed to establish to the satisfaction of the Court that he"
"is the landlord and there was a tenancy agreement between him and the 1st"
"defendant."
"When it comes to the judgment pronounced by the High Court in relation to"
"Case No. WP/HCCA/COL/44/2009/F, in addition to the above, it has been"
"determined that though there is a tenancy agreement in relation to premises"
"No. 149, Maliban Street, Colombo 11, that does not mean the existence of a"
"tenancy agreement between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant in relation to"
"the premises No. 147/1/8, although it was a part of the same building."
"It has also been held that since the plaintiff has failed to prove that he is the"
"landlord, considering the issue of sub-letting would not arise. Apart from that,"
"it has been determined that the evidence made available relating to the sub-"
"letting would not be sufficient for the Court to arrive at a conclusion in that"
"regard."
"This is a matter where the 1st  defendant has never contested the case filed"
"against him and the 2nd defendant on the basis of sub-letting of the premises"
"by  him  to  the  2nd  defendant.  There  has  been  no  denial  or  contest  that  the"
"plaintiff was the owner of the building, and it is he who let the building No."
"149, Maliban Street, Colombo 11 based on the written agreement marked P-"
"01 to the 1st defendant. When the document marked P-01 was produced in"
"Court, there had been no challenge to the said document, which becomes a"
"document that need not be further proved."
