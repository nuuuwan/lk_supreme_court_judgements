"(1) It is sufficient for a landlord to establish a prima facie case of sub-"
"letting and the burden then shifts to the tenant to explain the nature"
"of the occupation of the alleged sub-tenant."
"(2) Exclusive  possession  of  premises  by  a  sub-tenant  is  a  necessary"
"ingredient of sub-letting."
"(3) The  plaintiff  led  sufficient  prima  facie  evidence  of  a  sub-letting  by"
"proof of the fact that the 2nd defendant was in the premises doing"
"business and the 1st defendant appeared to have relinquished his"
"control of the premises. Consequently, the burden shifted to the 1st"
"defendant  to  explain  the  presence  of  the  2nd  defendant  on  the"
"premises doing business. This the 1st defendant failed to do."
