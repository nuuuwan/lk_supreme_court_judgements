"Although the learned High Court Judges of the Provincial High Court of the"
"Western Province holden in Colombo has held that the oral testimony of the"
"brother  of  the  plaintiff,  who  gave  evidence  on  behalf  of  him,  was  wholly"
"insufficient to prove that there was a tenancy agreement between the plaintiff"
"and the 1st defendant, it is abundantly clear that at the trial, it was not only"
"oral evidence, but also documentary evidence that has been led to establish"
"that the plaintiff was the landlord of the 1st defendant in the building under"
"litigation."
"I am of the view that the learned Judges of the High Court have erred on facts"
"and law after having stated that P-01 establishes that the 1st defendant is the"
"tenant of the plaintiff, but later deciding that such evidence was insufficient."
"When giving evidence, the witness called on behalf of the plaintiff has clearly"
"stated  that  his  brother  initially  gave  premises  No.  149  on  rent  to  the  1st"
"defendant based on the tenancy agreement marked P-01, and later, since the"
"1st defendant requested additional space, he orally agreed to give the upper"
"floor of the building, which has the assessment No. 147/1/8 also to the 1st"
"defendant. This was an uncontradicted and unchallenged evidence before the"
"District Court."
"The  2nd  defendant  has  never  denied  the  evidence  that  it  is  he  who  is  in"
"possession of both  the assessment  No. 149 and 147/1/8. His position had"
"been that he is the tenant of the plaintiff."
"The plaintiff has produced the document marked P-03 in this action, which"
"was  the  agreement  to  sub-let  the  premises  to  the  2nd  defendant  by  the  1st"
"defendant. Although the 2nd defendant has claimed that the signature in the"
"said  document  does  not  belong  to  him, the  plaintiff  has  clearly  established"
"that it was not so."
"The plaintiff has obtained a commission to the EQD through the Court, and"
"has  produced  the  relevant  Report  where  the  EQD  has  clearly  expressed  an"
"opinion that it was in fact the 2nd defendant who has signed the sub-letting"
"agreement marked P-03. The EQD has given evidence in Court to substantiate"
"his Report, and the learned District Judge, as he should, has independently"
