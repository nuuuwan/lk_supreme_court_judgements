"who  pronounced  the  judgments  in  both  the  cases  has  determined  that  the"
"oral testimony of the brother of the plaintiff was grossly insufficient to arrive"
"at a conclusion that there was a tenancy agreement between the plaintiff and"
"the 1st defendant. Therefore, it has been determined that since the tenancy"
"has not been proved, considering the question of sub-letting would not arise."
"However, it needs to be noted that in the same reasoning, the learned High"
"Court Judge has determined that the document marked  P-01, which is the"
"tenancy agreement between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant with reference"
"to the premises relating to Case No. 8448/RE, only establishes the fact that"
"the 1st defendant is the tenant under the plaintiff, which, as correctly pointed"
"out by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff was contrary to the earlier view"
"expressed by the learned High Court Judge where it was stated that tenancy"
"has not been proved."
"On the basis that tenancy has not been proved between the plaintiff and the"
"1st  defendant,  the  appeal  preferred  by  the  2nd  defendant  challenging  the"
"judgment of the learned District Judge has been allowed."
"Similarly,  in  Case  No.  WP/HCCA/COL/44/2009/F,  which  is  the  appeal  in"
"relation  to  the  District  Court  Case  No.  8449/RE,  the  learned  High  Court"
"Judge  has  determined  that  although  there  is  an  agreement  in  relation  to"
"premises  No.  149,  Maliban  Street,  Colombo  11,  which  is  the  agreement"
"marked  P-01,  it  does  not  mean  that  the  tenancy  or  sub-letting  has  been"
"proved in relation to assessment No. 147/1/8, although both the assessment"
"numbers relate to one building."
"It has been determined that bare statements adduced on behalf of the plaintiff"
"that  the  1st  defendant  is  the  tenant  of  the  plaintiff  and  he  has  sub-let  the"
"premises  to  the  2nd  defendant  is  insufficient  to  arrive  at  a  finding  in  that"
"regard. Accordingly, the judgment of the learned District Judge has been set"
"aside in relation to that case as well."
"When  this  matter  was  supported  for  Leave  to  Appeal  on  23-11-2015,  this"
"Court granted leave on the questions of law as set out in paragraph 17 (b), (c),"
"(d) and (e) of both the petitions."
