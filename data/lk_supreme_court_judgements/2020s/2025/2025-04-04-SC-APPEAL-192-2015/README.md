Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the plaintiff-respondent-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the plaintiff) on the basis of being aggrieved of the two separate

judgments pronounced by the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

holden in Colombo in Case Numbers WP/HCCA/COL/25/2009/(F) and

WP/HCCA/44/2009/(F), while exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction.

From the impugned judgments, the common judgment pronounced by the

learned District Judge of Colombo in District Court of Colombo Case No.

8448/RE and 8449/RE, where the judgments were in favour of the plaintiff

were set aside, and the two actions filed by him before the District Court was

dismissed.

The proceedings of the two cases filed before the District Court suggest that

it has been agreed by the parties to have one trial with regard to the above

mentioned two District Court cases and to have a common judgment, as the

parties in both cases, the causes of action, as well as the reliefs asked had

been the same.

This is a matter where the plaintiff filed an action against the 1st defendant of

both the cases and the 2nd defendant-appellant-respondent (hereinafter

referred as the 2nd defendant) seeking to evict the 2nd defendant from the

premises mentioned in the schedules of the two plaints. The action had been

instituted on the basis that the 1st defendant-respondent-respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the 1st defendant), who is his tenant of both

premises, has sub-let it to the 2nd defendant without authorization.

It was an admitted fact that the two premises were governed by the provisions

of the Rent Act and were business premises.

In Case No. 8448/RE, the relevant premises mentioned in the schedule had

been No. 149, Maliban Street, Colombo 11, while in Case No. 8449/RE, the

relevant premises had been No. 147/1/8, Maliban Street, Colombo 11.

Page 5 of 14

It is also clear that the assessment No. 149 referred to in Case No. 8448/RE

is the ground floor, and the assessment No. 147/1/8, which is the subject

matter of the Case No. 8449/RE, is the upper floor of assessment No. 149.

This in effect shows that the action has been in relation to one building with

two assessment numbers.

It appears from the case record that the 1st defendant has not taken part in

the case, and it was the 2nd defendant who has contested the action initiated

by the plaintiff. Although there had been no admission recorded, it is clear

that both the assessment numbers had been occupied by the 2nd defendant.

At the trial, the 2nd defendant has only formulated one issue on the basis that

the District Court lacks jurisdiction to hear and determine the cases, for

which the learned District Judge has answered considering it as a preliminary

issue. It had been determined that the Court has jurisdiction.

It appears that the position taken up by the 2nd defendant at the trial had

been that he is not the sub-tenant of the 1st defendant, but a tenant under

the plaintiff. Since it has been claimed by the 2nd defendant that the sub-

tenancy agreement relied on by the plaintiff was a fraudulent document, it

has been referred to the Examiner of the Questioned Document (EQD) where

it has been opined by the EQD that, in fact, the signatures in the said sub-

tenancy agreement belongs to the 2nd defendant.

At the trial before the District Court, it had been the brother of the plaintiff

who has given evidence on behalf of him. He has stated that since his brother

and other family members are undereducated, it is he who looked after the

property in question. He has produced the agreement marked P-01 where the

plaintiff has let the premises No. 149, Maliban Street, Colombo 11 to the 1st

defendant on rent. It has been his evidence that subsequent to the agreement

marked P-01, since the 1st defendant requested the upper floor of the building

which bears the assessment No. 147/1/8 also on rent, it too was given to him

although no written agreement was executed in that regard.

Page 6 of 14

Since, the 1st defendant has not contested both the actions, I do not see any

bar to accept the oral evidence led on behalf of the plaintiff in that regard.

The document marked P-01 has never been challenged in Court, which also

goes on to show that the learned District Judge has been correct in accepting

the said document and also the oral evidence led in that regard, to determine

that the 1st defendant was in fact, the tenant of the plaintiff.

It has been the evidence of the witness who gave evidence on behalf of the

plaintiff that few years after the agreement, they found the 2nd defendant in

occupation of the building, and when inquired from the 1st defendant, he

divulged to them that he sub-let the building to the 2nd defendant. It was the

1st defendant who has given the sub-letting agreement, which has been

marked as P-03, to the plaintiff. This was not a document marked subject to

proof.

Therefore, evidence adduced before the District Court amply supports the

contention of the plaintiff that although P-01 and P-03 relates to assessment

No. 149 only, the 1st defendant was his tenant in relation to assessment

No.147/1/8 as well, and the entire building has been sub-let to the 2nd

defendant by the 1st defendant.

It is abundantly clear from the judgment of the learned District Judge that

the learned District Judge has well considered the question of tenancy

between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant, and the question of sub-letting by

the 1st defendant to the 2nd defendant in relation to both the assessment

numbers.

Since it is an admitted fact that the premises in question is governed under

the terms of the Rent Act and is a business premises, there cannot be any

argument that a sub-letting by the tenant without the approval of the landlord

is a good ground where such a tenant can be evicted from the premises let to

him by the landlord.

Page 7 of 14

The relevant section 10(2) of the Rent Act reads as follows.

10. (2) Notwithstanding anything in any other law, the tenant of

any premises

(a) shall not, without the prior consent in writing of the

landlord, sublet the premises to any other person; or

(b) shall not sublet any part of the premises to any other

person

i. without the prior consent in writing of

the landlord; and

ii. unless prior to subletting he had applied

to the board to fix the proportionate rent

of such part of the premises and had

informed the board and the landlord the

name of the person to whom he proposes

to sublet such parts.

The learned District Judge has well considered the claim by the 2nd defendant,

that he is in occupation of the building as a tenant of the plaintiff, to conclude

that it has no basis. The learned District Judge has also considered the report

by the EQD not only on its face value, but by analysing his findings and also

the evidence placed before the Court to come to a firm finding that there is

documentary as well as oral evidence to justify a judgment in favour of the

plaintiff in both the matters.

It is on that basis; the learned District Judge has pronounced a common

judgment in relation to both the cases granting relief in favour of the plaintiff.

When this matter was appealed by the 2nd defendant to the Provincial High

Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo, exercising its civil appellate

jurisdiction, the learned Judges of the High Court has decided to pronounce

two separate judgments, although the matter has been argued as a single

appeal before the High Court.

In Case No. WP/HCCA/COL/25/2009(F), which was the judgment relating to

District Court of Colombo Case No. 8448/RE, the learned High Court Judge

Page 8 of 14

who pronounced the judgments in both the cases has determined that the

oral testimony of the brother of the plaintiff was grossly insufficient to arrive

at a conclusion that there was a tenancy agreement between the plaintiff and

the 1st defendant. Therefore, it has been determined that since the tenancy

has not been proved, considering the question of sub-letting would not arise.

However, it needs to be noted that in the same reasoning, the learned High

Court Judge has determined that the document marked P-01, which is the

tenancy agreement between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant with reference

to the premises relating to Case No. 8448/RE, only establishes the fact that

the 1st defendant is the tenant under the plaintiff, which, as correctly pointed

out by the learned Counsel for the plaintiff was contrary to the earlier view

expressed by the learned High Court Judge where it was stated that tenancy

has not been proved.

On the basis that tenancy has not been proved between the plaintiff and the

1st defendant, the appeal preferred by the 2nd defendant challenging the

judgment of the learned District Judge has been allowed.

Similarly, in Case No. WP/HCCA/COL/44/2009/F, which is the appeal in

relation to the District Court Case No. 8449/RE, the learned High Court

Judge has determined that although there is an agreement in relation to

premises No. 149, Maliban Street, Colombo 11, which is the agreement

marked P-01, it does not mean that the tenancy or sub-letting has been

proved in relation to assessment No. 147/1/8, although both the assessment

numbers relate to one building.

It has been determined that bare statements adduced on behalf of the plaintiff

that the 1st defendant is the tenant of the plaintiff and he has sub-let the

premises to the 2nd defendant is insufficient to arrive at a finding in that

regard. Accordingly, the judgment of the learned District Judge has been set

aside in relation to that case as well.

When this matter was supported for Leave to Appeal on 23-11-2015, this

Court granted leave on the questions of law as set out in paragraph 17 (b), (c),

(d) and (e) of both the petitions.

Page 9 of 14

The 2nd defendant who appealed against the District Court judgment, or the

1st defendant for that matter, never appeared before the Court or had legal

representation, although they were duly served with the relevant notices.

After the District Court judgment was pronounced in his favour, the plaintiff

has obtained writ pending appeal following due process to take possession of

the building under litigation, and it is he who is in possession of the building

as of now, which may explain the absence of the 2nd defendant from the appeal

proceedings before this Court.

When this matter was taken up for argument before this Court, having

considered the relevant facts and the circumstances, as well as the matters

urged in both the petitions, it was the view of the Court, as well as the learned

Counsel for the plaintiff, that in fact, the following questions of law commonly

stated in the petitions should be considered by this Court.

The said questions referred to in sub-paragraph (e) and (i) of paragraph 17 of

the petition reads as follows.

(e) The learned High Court Judge has seriously erred in facts by holding

that the petitioner has not adduced sufficient evidence to establish a

tenancy between the 1st respondent and the petitioner.

(i) The learned High Court Judge has erred in law in failing to consider

the document marked P-03, which was not marked subject to proof and

/or in ignorance of the said document produced to prove sub-letting.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the plaintiff that the learned

Judges of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo, exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction, erred when determining

that the plaintiff has failed to prove the fact that he is the landlord of the

premises. He pointed out that there was ample evidence before the Court,

both documentary and orally, that the plaintiff has given premises No. 149,

as well as No. 147/1/8 to the 1st defendant on rent. It was his position that

the evidence also shows that the said premises has been subsequently sub-

let to the 2nd defendant by the 1st defendant without the permission of the

plaintiff, who is the landlord.

Page 10 of 14

He lamented that the plaintiff not giving evidence in the case cannot be

considered as a valid reason to undermine the evidence led on behalf of the

plaintiff, which has proved the case on the balance of probability against the

two defendants. On that basis, he pleaded that the appeals should be allowed.

When considering the two appellate judgments pronounced by the learned

High Court Judges of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

holden in Colombo, it is clear that the judgment of the learned District Judge

of Colombo has been set aside for similar reasons. It has been determined

that the plaintiff has failed to establish to the satisfaction of the Court that he

is the landlord and there was a tenancy agreement between him and the 1st

defendant.

When it comes to the judgment pronounced by the High Court in relation to

Case No. WP/HCCA/COL/44/2009/F, in addition to the above, it has been

determined that though there is a tenancy agreement in relation to premises

No. 149, Maliban Street, Colombo 11, that does not mean the existence of a

tenancy agreement between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant in relation to

the premises No. 147/1/8, although it was a part of the same building.

It has also been held that since the plaintiff has failed to prove that he is the

landlord, considering the issue of sub-letting would not arise. Apart from that,

it has been determined that the evidence made available relating to the sub-

letting would not be sufficient for the Court to arrive at a conclusion in that

regard.

This is a matter where the 1st defendant has never contested the case filed

against him and the 2nd defendant on the basis of sub-letting of the premises

by him to the 2nd defendant. There has been no denial or contest that the

plaintiff was the owner of the building, and it is he who let the building No.

149, Maliban Street, Colombo 11 based on the written agreement marked P-

01 to the 1st defendant. When the document marked P-01 was produced in

Court, there had been no challenge to the said document, which becomes a

document that need not be further proved.

Page 11 of 14

Although the learned High Court Judges of the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province holden in Colombo has held that the oral testimony of the

brother of the plaintiff, who gave evidence on behalf of him, was wholly

insufficient to prove that there was a tenancy agreement between the plaintiff

and the 1st defendant, it is abundantly clear that at the trial, it was not only

oral evidence, but also documentary evidence that has been led to establish

that the plaintiff was the landlord of the 1st defendant in the building under

litigation.

I am of the view that the learned Judges of the High Court have erred on facts

and law after having stated that P-01 establishes that the 1st defendant is the

tenant of the plaintiff, but later deciding that such evidence was insufficient.

When giving evidence, the witness called on behalf of the plaintiff has clearly

stated that his brother initially gave premises No. 149 on rent to the 1st

defendant based on the tenancy agreement marked P-01, and later, since the

1st defendant requested additional space, he orally agreed to give the upper

floor of the building, which has the assessment No. 147/1/8 also to the 1st

defendant. This was an uncontradicted and unchallenged evidence before the

District Court.

The 2nd defendant has never denied the evidence that it is he who is in

possession of both the assessment No. 149 and 147/1/8. His position had

been that he is the tenant of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff has produced the document marked P-03 in this action, which

was the agreement to sub-let the premises to the 2nd defendant by the 1st

defendant. Although the 2nd defendant has claimed that the signature in the

said document does not belong to him, the plaintiff has clearly established

that it was not so.

The plaintiff has obtained a commission to the EQD through the Court, and

has produced the relevant Report where the EQD has clearly expressed an

opinion that it was in fact the 2nd defendant who has signed the sub-letting

agreement marked P-03. The EQD has given evidence in Court to substantiate

his Report, and the learned District Judge, as he should, has independently

Page 12 of 14

analysed whether the expert opinion can be accepted or not, before deciding

to accept the expert opinion as relevant.

It is my considered view that the plaintiff, being the landlord, has established

on balance of probability, a prima facie case of sub-letting of the premisses

bearing both the assessment numbers by the 1st defendant to the 2nd

defendant without permission. I find that the learned High Court Judges of

the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo had no

legally tenable basis to hold that the plaintiff has failed to prove the tenancy

between himself and the 1st defendant, and to hold that considering the

question of sub-letting would not arise.

It is well settled law that once the sub-letting is established, the burden shifts

to the tenant to explain the nature of the occupation by the alleged sub-

tenant.

In the case of Sangadasa Vs. Hussain and Another (1999) 2 SLR 395, the

plaintiff filed an action to have the defendants ejected from the business

premises let to the 1st defendant on the ground that the 1st defendant tenant

has sub-let the premises to the 2nd defendant. The defendants, whilst denying

sub-letting, pleaded that by virtue of a notarial agreement, they had entered

into a partnership to run a business at the premises.

Held:

(1) It is sufficient for a landlord to establish a prima facie case of sub-

letting and the burden then shifts to the tenant to explain the nature

of the occupation of the alleged sub-tenant.

(2) Exclusive possession of premises by a sub-tenant is a necessary

ingredient of sub-letting.

(3) The plaintiff led sufficient prima facie evidence of a sub-letting by

proof of the fact that the 2nd defendant was in the premises doing

business and the 1st defendant appeared to have relinquished his

control of the premises. Consequently, the burden shifted to the 1st

defendant to explain the presence of the 2nd defendant on the

premises doing business. This the 1st defendant failed to do.

Page 13 of 14

(4) The partnership agreement was demonstrably a sham. The

inference could, therefore, be drawn that the 2nd defendant was in

exclusive possession of the premises, managing a business which

admitted no owner but himself. On a balance of probability, the only

inference the Court could draw was that the 1st defendant had

rented out the premises to the 2nd defendant hence the plaintiff was

entitled to judgment.

In the case of A.Z.M Azhar Vs. S. M. Fernando 76 NLR 118, it was held,

Where, in an action instituted by a landlord to eject his tenant on the

ground that the tenant has sub-let a portion of the rented premises, the

landlords evidence is sufficient to establish a prima facie case of sub-

letting. The burden is then on the tenant to furnish evidence in rebuttal.

In the case under appeal, the 1st defendant who is the tenant, has not

contested the cases filed against him by the plaintiff who is his landlord, and

it had been the 2nd defendant who is the alleged sub-tenant of the 1st

defendant who has contested the cases. It has been proved that it is the sub-

tenant who is in possession of the premisses bearing the two assessment

numbers.

It is abundantly clear that the plaintiff has established the facts stated in both

the cases to prove the sub-letting. Under the circumstances, neither the 1st

defendant nor the 2nd defendant has led sufficient evidence to rebut the

evidence led on behalf of the plaintiff.

For the reasons as considered above, I answer both the questions of law

formulated at the hearing of this appeal in the affirmative.

Accordingly, I set aside the two judgments pronounced by the learned High

Court Judges of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo, on 25-08-2014 while exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction in

Case No. WP/HCCA/COL/25/2009/(F) and WP/HCCA/44/2009/(F) as both

the judgments cannot be allowed to stand.

Page 14 of 14

Hence, I affirm the judgment dated 07-01-2009 pronounced as a single

judgment by the learned District Judge of Colombo with the agreement of the

parties in relation to the District Court of Colombo Case No. 8448/RE and

8449/RE.

The appeal is allowed. There will be no costs of the appeal.
