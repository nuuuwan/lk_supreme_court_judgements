"agreement on the basis of which the sum is claimed.” The implication of this"
"observation  in  the  special  determination  is  that,  if  there  is  no  written"
"promise  or  agreement,  an  action  under 
the  Debt  Recovery 
(Special"
"Provisions) Act cannot be filed."
"In this regard, let me first state the following. The aforesaid Bill, brought in"
"2003, has not become law as an Act of Parliament. In Ukwatte v. DFCC Bank"
"[2004] 1 Sri LR 164, Sripavan J. (as His Lordship then was) stated at 167"
"that  in  Supreme  Court  Special  Determinations  what  is  examined  by  the"
"Supreme Court is the constitutionality of a Bill and not the constitutionality"
"of  the  provisions  contained  in  an  Act  already  in  force.  The  constitutional"
"jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is distinct and different from the appellate"
"jurisdiction  it  exercises.  Supreme  Court  Special  Determinations  have  no"
"binding effect as they are advisory in character."
"If  this  Court  were  to  hold  that  the  special  procedure  under  the  Debt"
"Recovery  (Special  Provisions)  Act  applies  only  where  there  is  a  written"
"promise or agreement,  such an interpretation would be inconsistent with"
"section 4(1) of the Act, which requires the plaintiff to file with the plaint the"
"“instrument,  agreement  or  document  sued  upon,  or 
relied  on  by 
the"
"institution”.  The  term  “or”  is  a  coordinating  conjunction  used  to  present"
"alternatives. The words “instrument” and “document” in section 4(1) cannot"
"be rendered meaningless and redundant. The legislature does not employ"
"words in vain, and every word in a statute must be given meaning. A written"
"agreement and a document are not the  same.  All written agreements are"
"documents  but  all  documents  are  not  written  agreements.  Therefore,  the"
"proposition  that  an  action  under  this  Act  can  only  be  filed  on  a  written"
"promise or agreement is not acceptable."
"If the intention of the legislature were to restrict the institution of actions"
"under this Act solely to cases where there is a written promise or agreement,"
"the legislature, in section 4(1), instead of stating that the plaintiff shall file"
