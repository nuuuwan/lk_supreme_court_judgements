"money should be ‘ascertainable’ at the time of institution of the action"
"and  alleged  by  a  lending  institution  to  have  arisen  from  ‘a  banking,"
"lending,  financial  or  other  allied  business  activity’  of  the  institution."
"This term ‘debt’ has been considered by the Appellate Courts on many"
"an  instance  and  given  a  wide  meaning  to  include  ‘overdrafts’  and"
"‘guarantees’ as well."
"In Kiran Atapattu v. Pan Asia Bank Ltd [2005] 2 Sri LR 276 at 279, the"
"Court of Appeal held whether one calls the sum borrowed ‘an overdraft"
"or a loan’ if it is capable of being ascertained it falls within the meaning"
"of ‘debt’ under section 30 of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act"
"preponing the theory that what is material is the sum being capable of"
"being ascertained at the time of institution of the case."
"Similarly, in Dharmaratne v. People’s Bank [2003] 3 Sri LR 307, a case"
"filed  under  the  Debt  Recovery  Act,  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  an"
"‘overdraft’  falls  within  the  definition  of  ‘debt’  as  the  overdraft  arises"
"from a transaction relating to banking. In  that case the contention of"
"appellant, that the ‘overdraft’ was not a ‘debt’ or a ‘loan’ was rejected"
"by the Court of Appeal."
"In Eassuwaran and others v. Bank of Ceylon [2006] 1 Sri LR 365, a"
"case decided by this Court, Raja Fernando, J. (with S.N. Silva, C.J. and"
"Thilakawardena, J. agreeing) held that a ‘guarantee’ provided by the"
"appellants falls within the definition of ‘debt’ and a lending institution"
"could  have  recourse  to  the  provisions  of  the  Debt  Recovery  (Special"
"Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990 as amended. In this case the contention"
"that the provisions of the Act apply only to a ‘fixed term loan’ and not"
"to any ‘credit or overdraft facility’ and that if the ‘debt’ was a ‘credit"
"facility  or  an  overdraft  facility’,  the  provisions  of  the  Debt  Recovery"
"(Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990 as amended does not apply was"
"overruled by this Court."
