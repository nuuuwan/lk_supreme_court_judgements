"There is no law requiring a board resolution for a bank to grant an overdraft"
"facility  to  a  company.  P2  is  not  a  decisive  document  for  the  plaintiff  to"
"establish its case. If the District Judge thought P2 is not relevant, she could"
"have  disregarded  that  document  and  examined  the  other  documents  to"
"consider whether there is a sum of money which is ascertainable or capable"
"of being ascertained at the time of the institution of the action. Although"
"the  District  Judge  highlighted  P2,  she  failed  to  address  her  mind  to  P6,"
"which is the resolution passed by the board of directors of the defendant"
"company  explicitly  acknowledging  the  overdraft  facility  obtained  through"
"the relevant current account."
"The defendant admitted the issuance of cheques and payment by the bank"
"but  conspicuously  failed  to  explain  how  the  overdrawn  amounts  were"
"repaid. This is the crux of the matter. The defendant must explain how the"
"overdraft  was  settled,  either  in  full  or  in  part,  rather  than  advancing"
"convoluted arguments spanning several pages in the written submissions"
"filed before both the District Court and this Court, which do not assist the"
"Court  but  only  serve  to  obfuscate  the  issue  before  the  Court.  As  I  have"
"already stated, in actions filed under this Act, defendants cannot raise high-"
"flown technical objections designed to prolong the proceedings to defeat the"
"purpose of the Act."
