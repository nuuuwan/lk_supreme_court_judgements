"SC/APPEAL/148/2019"
"18"
"Before  section  4(1)  was  amended  by  Act  No.  9  of  1994,  the  plaintiff  was"
"required  to  tender  the  original  instrument,  agreement  or  document  sued"
"upon or relied on by the plaintiff. However, after the said amendment, it is"
"sufficient to file copies of them with the plaint."
"This is further confirmed by section 8, as amended, which provides that, at"
"the  stage  of  support,  the  Court  may  direct  the  plaintiff  to  produce  the"
"original documents for its perusal and return."
