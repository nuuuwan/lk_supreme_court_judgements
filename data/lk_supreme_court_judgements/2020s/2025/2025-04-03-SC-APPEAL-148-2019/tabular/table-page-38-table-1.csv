"by  affidavits  with  other  documents  in  order  to  seek  leave  to  appear  and"
"show  cause.  This  can  be  considered  as  objections 
to 
the  plaintiff’s"
"application.  Hence,  there  is  no  necessity  to  serve  copies  of  them  on  the"
"plaintiff  forty-eight  hours  before  the  date  of  the  main  inquiry,  if  those"
"documents had already been served on the plaintiff at the leave inquiry."
"It is noteworthy that section 384 uses the phrase “read such affidavits”. The"
"provision does not specify from where or how the respondent shall read the"
"affidavits. If the respondent merely reads the affidavits, it does not amount"

"evidence” are separated by the coordinating conjunction “or”, which is used"
"to present alternatives."
"One  cannot  argue  that  it  is  unfair  to  allow  the  respondent  to  read  the"
"affidavits  without  being  subject 
to  cross-examination,  as

"examination when he supported the application for the order nisi or decree"
"nisi, as the case may be."
"However, if the respondent chooses to adduce oral evidence in support of"
"his objections or to rebut the evidence of the petitioner, he can be subject"
"to  cross-examination.  I  must  stress  that  the  respondent  can  adduce  oral"
"evidence only with the leave of the Court, and not as a matter of right."
"Section 385 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:"
