"If the defence is not prima facie sustainable, can the Court make the"
"decree nisi absolute?"
"If  the  Court  decides  that  the  defence  is  not  prima  facie  sustainable,  the"
"Court  cannot  make  the  decree  nisi  absolute.  In  such  circumstances,  the"
"Court  cannot  act  under  section  6(2)(c)  but  shall  proceed  under  section"
"6(2)(a) and allow the defendant to appear and show cause by depositing the"
"entire sum mentioned in the decree nisi. However, depending on the nature"
"of the defence, the Court may proceed under section 6(2)(b) and allow the"
"defendant  to  appear  and  show  cause  by  furnishing  security.  If  the  Court"
"proceeds  under section 6(2)(b), the security ordered shall not be nominal"

"absolute, even if the defence is not prima facie sustainable, is justified on"
"several grounds."
"In the first place, what section 6(2) states is that “The court shall upon the"
"filing of the defendant of an application for leave to appear and show cause"
"supported by affidavit....grant leave to appear and show cause against the"
"decree nisi”, by directing the defendant (a) to deposit the entire sum; or (b)"
"to furnish reasonable and sufficient security; or (c) to furnish security or"
"otherwise as the Court thinks fit. The District Judge shall select one of the"
"three alternatives. Making the decree nisi absolute is not one of them."
"At  the  stage  of  seeking  leave  to  appear and  show  cause,  while  the  Court"
"seriously considers whether a prima facie sustainable defence exists, it does"
"not necessarily adjudicate the main case on its merits."
"One may wonder why the Court should grant the defendant an opportunity"
"to defend the plaintiff’s case if the defendant fails to satisfy the Court at the"
"leave stage that he has a prima facie sustainable defence. When something"
