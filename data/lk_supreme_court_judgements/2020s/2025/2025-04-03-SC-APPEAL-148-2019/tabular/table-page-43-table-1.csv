"තපාතරාන්තුවක් ත ෝ එකතුවීමක් ඉදිරිපේ කර තනාමැේතේද?"
"3.  එකි විසදිය යුතු ප්‍ර ේන තදකෙ වග උේතරකාර පාර් වතේ වාසියෙ පිලිතුරු  ලැතෙන්තතන්ත"

"The District Judge answered them as follows and dismissed the plaintiff’s"
"action."
"1.  නැත."
"2.  නැත."
"3.  එතසේය."
"The term “එකතුවීමක්” has no meaning in this context. These questions lack"
"clarity."

"could not have been answered in the affirmative."
"It  appears  that  what  was  meant  by  ලිඛිත  තපාතරාන්තුවක්  ත ෝ  එකතුවීමක්  is  a"
"written promise or agreement.  I have previously addressed this matter in"
"this  judgment.  The  action  does  not  become  bad  in  law  merely  because  a"
"written promise or agreement is not filed with the plaint.  The preliminary"
"objections are unsustainable in law."
"The argument advanced before this Court is somewhat different.  It is the"
"position of the counsel for the defendant before this Court that the plaintiff"
"did not tender with the plaint an instrument, agreement or document as"
"required by section 4(1) of the Act and therefore the action of the plaintiff"
"has  been  instituted  in  violation  of  the  mandatory  provisions  of  the  Debt"
"Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 1990. Leave to appeal against the"
"judgment of the High Court was granted to the defendant on that basis. I"
"have previously addressed this matter also in this judgment."
