"and show cause against the decree nisi…upon the court being satisfied on"
"the contents of the affidavit filed, that they disclose a defence which is prima"
"facie sustainable and on such terms as to security, framing and recording of"
"issues, or otherwise as the court thinks fit.”"
"The phrase in section 6(2)(c) of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act,"
"“on such terms as to security, framing and recording of issues, or otherwise"
"as the court thinks fit” was borrowed from section 706 of the Civil Procedure"
"Code in regard to summary procedure on liquid claims. Section 706 reads"
"as follows: “The court shall, upon application by the defendant, give leave to"
"appear  and  to  defend  the  action  upon  the  defendant  paying  into  court  the"
"sum mentioned in the summons, or upon affidavits satisfactory to the court"
"which disclose a defence or such facts as would make it incumbent on the"
"holder  to  prove  consideration,  or  such  other  facts  as  the  court  may  deem"
"sufficient to support the application and on such terms as to security, framing,"
"and recording issues, or otherwise, as the court thinks fit.” In Ramanayake"
"v. Sampath Bank (supra) at page 150 it was observed that “The procedure"
"under  this  Act  is  very  similar  to  the  summary  procedure  on  liquid  claims"
"provided in Chapter 53 (sections 703 to 711) of the Code.” In  Sebastian v."
"Kumarajeewa (supra), this Court, reviewed the previous authorities on the"
"applicability  of  section  706  regarding  ordering  security  in  greater  detail."
"Whilst holding that “In an application for leave to appear and defend, even"
"if  the  affidavit  of  the  defendant  is  satisfactory,  the  court  can  exercise  its"
"discretion under section 706 and order the defendant to deposit part of the"
"sum  claimed  in  the  plaint  as  a  condition  to  defend  the  action”,  the  Court"
"further stated at page 269 that “Needless to state however is the position,"
"that when the defence outlined is very ‘satisfactory’ the learned Judge may"
"well exercise his discretion in terms of section 706 and permit the Defendant"
"to appear and defend unconditionally.”"
