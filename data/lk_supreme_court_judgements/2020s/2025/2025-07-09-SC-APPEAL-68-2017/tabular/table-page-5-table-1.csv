"","7.  The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the petition filed"
"","before  the  District  Court  of  Monaragala  reveals  that  the  1st  and  2nd"
"","respondents  were,  in  essence,  seeking  to  renegotiate  the  terms  of  a"
"","settlement  to  which  they  had  previously  consented.  They 
further"
"","contended  that  respondents'  claim  of  lack  of  consent  is    simply  an"
"","excuse that seems to have been made up just to question the validity"
"","of the settlement order."
"8.","It  is  the  contention  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  that  the"
"","answer filed in the District Court proceedings was jointly tendered on"
"","behalf of both the 1st and 2nd respondents by the same Attorney-at-"
"","Law.  On  that  basis,  it  was  argued  that  the  respondents  cannot  now"
"","disclaim the settlement, as they have been jointly represented and have"
"","actively participated in the proceedings up to the point of settlement."
"","The learned Counsel further stated that, the mere absence of the 2nd"
"","respondent from Court does not render the order invalid, particularly"
"","as the Counsel representing the respondents was present at the time"
"","the order was made."
