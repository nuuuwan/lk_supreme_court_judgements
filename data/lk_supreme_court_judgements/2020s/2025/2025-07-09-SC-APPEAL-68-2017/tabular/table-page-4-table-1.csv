"The respondents also took the position that, as the 2nd respondent was"
"not  present  in  Court  on  the  date  of  the  settlement,  she  is  not  legally"
"bound to act in terms of the settlement. It was further submitted that"
"the  2nd  Respondent  is  in  fact,  the  true  owner  of  the  corpus.  The"
"respondents  also  contended  that,  although  the  1st  Respondent  was"
"present  in  Court  at  the  time  the  settlement  was  recorded,  he  did  not"
"fully comprehend the significance and implications of the terms of the"
"settlement, owing to his advanced age."
