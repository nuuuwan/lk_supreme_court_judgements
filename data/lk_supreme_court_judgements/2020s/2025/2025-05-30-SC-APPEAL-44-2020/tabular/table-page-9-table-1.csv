"It had been her contention that the partition action should be dismissed since"
"there was no basis to partition the land."
"It is clear from the learned District Judgeâ€™s judgment that the learned District"
"Judge has correctly identified the law relating to a partition action. It has been"
"determined  that  the  plaintiffs  have  failed  to  follow  the  necessary  provisions  of"
"Partition  Law  when 
instituting  the  partition  action,  and  that  there 
is  no"
"possibility for the Court to partition only a portion of a land as claimed by the"
"plaintiffs. It has also been determined that the real purpose of  instituting this"
