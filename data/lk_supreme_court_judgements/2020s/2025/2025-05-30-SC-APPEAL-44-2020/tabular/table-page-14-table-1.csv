"action pleading his title for an undivided 1/3 share of the corpus sought to be"
"partitioned and stating that although he is aware that the defendants are also"
"entitled to rights from the corpus, he is unaware as to how they derive title. He"
"has also disclosed the fact of existence of several deeds pertaining to the land,"
"but has stated that he could not ascertain rights based upon them."
"The defendants have pleaded their title to the land sought to be partitioned and"
"had  claimed  rights  although  they  have  sought  either  the  partitioning  of  the"
"land or the dismissal of the action."
"The 
learned  trial  Judge  has 
investigated  the  title  of  each  party  and  has"
"pronounced  his  judgment  ordering  the  partitioning  of  the  land,  but  when  the"
"matter  was  appealed  to  the  Provincial  High  Court,  the  learned  Judges  of  the"
"High Court has thought it fit to  dismiss the partition action on  the basis that"
"the plaintiff of the District Court action has only set up his rights for 1/3 share"

"learned Counsel for the plaintiffs."
"Therefore,  it  is  my  considered  view  that  the  learned  Judges  of  the  Provincial"
"High Court  of the  Western Province Holden  in Mount Lavinia  was misdirected"
"in  deciding  to  order  the  partitioning  of  the  land  based  on  the  evidence  placed"
"before  the  trial  Court.  I  find  that  that  learned  Judges  of  the  Provincial  High"
