"looks at the original plan  No. 693 dated 20-08-1942, as I said previously, the"
"road  reservation  was  not  a  part  of  lot  A  and  B  mentioned  in  the  plan.  It  has"
"been  kept  as  a  road  reservation  from  the  Southern  boundary  of  the  land  to"
"have access to the main road."
"The plan of the Commissioner of the case shows that the said access has been"
"provided to enter Anderson Road. There is no basis for the plaintiffsâ€™ claim that"
"they  are  entitled  to  a  10-foot-wide  access  road  from  the  Western  boundary  of"
"the  land  as  claimed  by  them.  It  is  clear  from  the  preliminary  survey  plan"
"prepared  by  the  Commissioner  K.A.  Perera  (plan  No.  659  dated  27-03-2010),"
"that the road access marked lot 02 is an access with a width of 5 feet,  which"
"has provided access to the portion of the land held and possessed by the two"
"plaintiffs.  The  said  lot  02  is  clearly  in  line  with  the  title  deed  relied  on  by  the"
"defendant to claim title to the undivided 15 perches of land where the original"
"owner  has  clearly  kept  a  5  feet  wide  path  from  the  Eastern  boundary  of  the"
"land  to  gain  access  to  the  balance  portion  of  the  land,  which  she  has  later"
"gifted to the plaintiffs."
"For  the  reasons  as  considered  above,  I  find  that  the  learned  District  Judge  of"
"Mount Lavinia was correct in deciding to dismiss the partition action as it was"
"the only option available under the given circumstances."
"I  find  that  the  learned  Judges  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  the  Western"
"Province  Holden  in  Mount  Lavinia  erred  in  setting  aside  the  judgment  of  the"
"learned  District  Judge  of  Mount  Lavinia  and  deciding  to  order  partitioning  of"
"the land when there was no basis for such a pronouncement."
"Accordingly,  I  answer  the  question  of  law  in  the  affirmative  and  set  aside  the"
"judgment  dated  15-10-2019  pronounced  by  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  the"
"Western  Province  Holden  in  Mount  Lavinia,  while  exercising  its  civil  appellate"
"jurisdiction."
