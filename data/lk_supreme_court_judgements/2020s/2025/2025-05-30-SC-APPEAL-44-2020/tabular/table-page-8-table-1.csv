"In paragraph 11 of the amended plaint, they have set out what they claimed as"
"their right to obtain a 10-foot-wide road access from the Western boundary of"
"the plan No. 693 dated 20-08-1942, and has stated that accordingly, a cause of"
"action  has  accrued  to  them  to  get  the  land  described  in  the  schedule  of  the"
"amended plaint to be partitioned in terms of Partition Law No. 21 of 1977."
"It is quite apparent from the prayer of the plaint that the plaintiffs have prayed"
"to partition only 11 perches out of the land depicted in plan No. 693 dated 20-"
"08-1942, and for other incidental reliefs."
"At the trial, there had been no disputes as to the facts that the original owner"
"of  the  land  was  the  earlier  mentioned  Sisiliyana  Hamine  Perera,  and  that  she"
"has gifted an undivided 11 perches of land by deed No. 687 dated 19-07-1983"
"to the plaintiffs, and that they are the owners of the said undivided portion of"
"land  along  with  the  road  access  mentioned,  and  that  they  have  acquired"
"prescriptive rights to the said portion of land as well."
"There  had  been  no  dispute  that  the  plaintiffs  are  in  possession  of  the  house,"
"which bears assessment No. 128/5, situated towards the Western boundary of"
"the land."
"The  points  of  contest  raised  by  the  plaintiffs  clearly  show  that  their  intention"
"had  been  only  to  partition  their  undivided  rights,  and  to  have  a  10-foot-wide"
"access  road  to  the  said  land  on  the  basis  that  the  original  plan  relied  on  by"
"them  have  given  such  an  access  road  to  them,  and  accordingly,  they  are"
"entitled to the said access road."
"The  defendant  had  raised  her  points  of  contest  on  the  basis  that  she  is  the"
"owner of an undivided 15 perches of land based on deed No. 2768 dated 07-04-"
"1974,  and  the  plaintiffs  can  only  have  rights  to  a  5-foot-wide  access  road  to"
"their land and nothing more. She has also taken up the position that after the"
"original  survey  plan  relied  on  by  the  plaintiffs,  another  amicable  plan  was"
"prepared  by  the  same  surveyor,  and  accordingly,  plaintiffs  have  prepared  a"
"partition deed as well, and the parties are possessing the land as separate lots."
