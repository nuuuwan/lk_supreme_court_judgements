"They have claimed that the original owner of the land sought to be partitioned"
"was  one  Wijesekara  Gama  Arachchige  Sisiliyana  Hamine  Perera,  and  has"
"stated  that  the  said  Sisiliyana  Hamine  gifted  an  undivided  11  perches  of  the"
"land  by  deed  No.  687  dated  19-07-1983  to  them.  Accordingly,  they  have"
"claimed title to an undivided 11 perches of land depicted in plan No. 693 dated"
"20-08-1942 by Surveyor I.W.W. Indatissa, where the said land has been shown"
"as lot A and B, together with a right of way adjacent to the Southern boundary"
"of the land."
"It  has  been  pleaded  that  the  said  Sisiliyana  Hamine,  who  was  the  original"
"owner, passed away on 04-09-1996, unmarried and without issues, and hence,"
"it  has  become  necessary  for  the  plaintiffs  to  set  apart  the  11  perches  of  land"
"owned  by  them,  including  the  right  of  way  as  mentioned,  from  the  land  the"
"defendant is possessing."
"On that basis, the plaintiffs have only set out their entitlement to a portion of"
"the land sought to be partitioned. It is clear that their intention had been to get"
"a partition judgment only in relation to the said portion, and not for the entire"
"land."
"The relevant paragraph 08 and 10 of the amended plaint reads as follows;"
