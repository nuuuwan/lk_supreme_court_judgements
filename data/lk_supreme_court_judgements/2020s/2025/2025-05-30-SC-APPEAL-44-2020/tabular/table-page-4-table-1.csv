"After  trial,  the 
learned  District  Judge  of  Mount  Lavinia,  pronouncing  her"
"judgment  on  12-10-2017,  has  determined  among  other  matters  that, 
the"
"plaintiffs  have  only  sought  to  partition  a  portion  of  a  larger  land  without"
"disclosing  the  rights  of  the  defendant,  which  cannot  be  allowed  in  terms  of"
"Partition Law. It has also been determined that there is no basis for the Court"

"civil  appellate  jurisdiction,  has  determined  that  there  was  sufficient  basis  for"
"the  learned  District  Judge  to  order  the  partitioning  of  the  land  sought  to  be"
"partitioned.  It  has  been  determined  that  since  it  is  the  duty  of  the  Court  to"

learned  District  Judge  could  have"
"examined  the  title  of  the  defendant  as  well,  although  the  plaintiffs  have  not"
"sought a partition decree against the defendant."
"Accordingly, it has been determined that the plaintiffs and the defendants are"
"co-owners of the land sought to be partitioned, and the land should be divided"
"based on the preliminary plan prepared for the purposes of the partition action"
"in the following manner;"
