"No. 693 by Surveyor Indatissa."
"Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  for  some  reason,  plaintiffs  had  suppressed  or  had"
"decided  to  ignore  the  rights  of  the  defendant  when  they  filed  the  partition"
"action  in  relation  to  the  portion  of  the  land  mentioned  in  the  schedule  of  the"
"plaint."
"It is clear from the  plan marked as V-01 on behalf of the defendant,  which is"
"the  plan  No.  3555  dated  13-12-1983  by  Surveyor  I.W.W  Indatissa,  which  has"
"been  referred  to  in  the  partition  deed  marked  as  V-02,  namely  deed  No.  709"
"dated  12-02-2002  by  Notary  Public  S.P.K.  Samarathunga,  the  said  plan  had"
"been used for the purpose of an apparent amicable partition plan between the"

"between all the co-owners which should include the defendant, what is clear is"
"that  the  plaintiffs  have  been  using  a  5-foot-wide  foot  path  right  throughout"
"after they received the deed of gift upon which they claimed title to the land."
"In  the  case  of  Girigoris  Appuhami  Vs.  Maria  Nona  60  NLR  330,  it  was"
"determined that;"
