RESPONDENTS

BEFORE : P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

COUNSEL : Samhan Munzir instructed by Prinath Fernando for the

Petitioners.

Fazly Razik, DSG for the 1st – 47th Respondents.

[SC FR 292/2021] - Page 14 of 18

ARGUED ON : 05-12-2024

DECIDED ON : 03-07-2025

P. PADMAN SURASENA J.

The Petitioners are Police officers of the rank of Chief Inspector of Police. They claim that

their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been

violated by the decision (P 2) to backdate the promotion of the 48th Respondent. The

Petitioners claim that the 48th Respondent is only yet another Police Officer who is similarly

circumstanced with them.

It is a committee comprising of the 1st to 4th Respondents named as “the Political Victimization

Committee” (hereinafter referred to as PVC) which has made the recommendation to backdate

the promotion of the 48th-51st Respondents with effect from 01-01-2014 and the 52nd

Respondent’s promotion with effect from 26-07-2015. This recommendation is contained in

the document marked 46R 3.

The Hon. Minister of Public Security then placed the said recommendation by the PVC before

the Cabinet of Ministers by way of the Cabinet Memorandum titled ‘Providing Relief to

Government and Semi-government Employees who were subjected to political vendetta’. This

Cabinet Memorandum is dated 01-04-2021 and produced in this proceeding marked 46R 2

(a) and 46R 2 (b). The Cabinet of Ministers (5th to 32nd Respondents), having considered

the said Cabinet Memorandum, has approved the implementation of the said recommendation

by the PVC. It can be seen that the Cabinet of Ministers (5th to 32nd Respondents) by their

Cabinet Decision dated 28-06-2021 (marked 46R 1) having considered the afore-said Cabinet

Memorandum has decided as follows:

After discussion, Cabinet was of the view that it is justifiable to grant redress to the

Police Officers who had been subjected to victimization administratively as found by

the above Committee and accordingly the Cabinet concurred with the

recommendations in the Report of the said Committee attached to the Memorandum,

other than the recommendation at No.26 therein.

At the ensued discussion, it was decided to request the Public Service Commission to

take expeditious action to implement the recommendations in the Report of the

Committee attached to the Memorandum, other than the recommendation at No.26

[SC FR 292/2021] - Page 15 of 18

therein, giving due consideration to the matters stated in sub-paragraphs 2.2, 2.3 and

2.4 in paragraph 02 of the Memorandum.

It was also decided to treat this decision as confirmed and to authorize the Secretary

to the Cabinet of Ministers to convey the same to the relevant authorities for necessary

action accordingly.1

It is pursuant to the above Cabinet Decision that the Public Service Commission (33rd to 43rd

Respondents) by its letter dated 20-08-2021 bearing No. PSC/EST/05-03/04/2021 (marked

46R 4), informed the Ministry of Public Security to implement the said recommendation by

the PVC. The 46th Respondent who is the Inspector General of Police has annexed to his

affidavit, the above documents, i.e., the Cabinet Memorandum; the decision of the Cabinet of

Ministers; report of the PVC; the letter by the Public Service Commission; and all the other

documents relevant thereto.

Thereafter, the Ministry of Public Security, by its letter dated 20-08-2021 bearing No.

MPS/PVC/CAB/01/2021 (marked 46R 5), informed the Inspector General of Police (46th

Respondent) to take steps to implement the above recommendations.

Thus, it was the above sequence of events which has prompted the 46th Respondent (IGP) to

give effect to the recommendations of the said PVC by way of RTM-761 CRTM 389 dated 26-

08-2021 (marked P 2), which ordered the afore-stated backdating of the promotions of the

48th to 52nd Respondents, according to the recommendation made by the PVC. Although there

are five Police Officers (the 48th to 52nd Respondents) in favour of whom the said PVC

recommendation operates, the primary concern of the twelve Petitioners who filed this case

is to get the backdating of the promotion of the 48th Respondent to operate with effect from

01-01-2014, quashed. It is this action that the Petitioners complain as the infringement of

their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Further, the 46th Respondent, by RTM 128 CRTM 53, dated 04-09-2021 (marked P 5), called

for interviews for the posts of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), for which the 48th

Respondent has become eligible following the impugned backdating. It was the position of

the Petitioners that if a promotion is granted to the 48th Respondent as an ASP, it would cause

the Petitioners grave and irreparable injustice. When Court granted the Petitioners Leave to

Proceed against the Respondents on 09-05-2022 in respect of the alleged infringement of

their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution, Court has also

1 Paragraph 35, Decision of the Cabinet Meeting held on 28-06-2021, marked 46R 1.

[SC FR 292/2021] - Page 16 of 18

granted an interim order as prayed for, in prayer (f) of the Amended Petition dated 24-06-

2022 and restrained the Respondents from promoting the 48th – 51st Respondents to the rank

of ASP.

It is the position of the Petitioners that the Petitioners and the 48th Respondent are similarly

circumstanced and therefore the implementation of the Cabinet decision (46R 1) in respect

of the 48th Respondent by the Inspector General of Police is discriminatory against them and

therefore amounts to an unequal treatment violating the Fundamental Rights of the

Petitioners, guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

Let me now consider whether the backdating of the promotion of 48th Respondent to operate

with effect from 01-01-2014, is justifiable.

Both the Petitioners and the 48th Respondent have joined the police service as Sub Inspectors

on the same day (on 13-06-1999); they have been promoted to the rank of Inspector of Police

on the same date (on 25-09-2007); they have become eligible for the promotion to the rank

of Chief Inspector of Police on the same date (on 01-01-2020).2 The Petitioners have produced

the relevant documents3 as evidence of this claim.

The Petitioners further state that the 48th Respondent has not been politically victimized so as

to warrant his being treated over the Petitioners. Moreover, it is the position of the Petitioners:

a) that the 48th Respondent has neither been served with a charge sheet at any time

nor any disciplinary inquiry has been conducted against him;

b) that the 48th Respondent has never been interdicted nor served with a vacation

of post at any time;

c) that the 48th Respondent has never been in a rank lower to that of the Petitioners

and therefore there was no manifestation that the 48th Respondent is an officer

who has been politically victimized at the time the PVC had made the

recommendation.

The 48th Respondent has not countered any of the above positions. The 46th Respondent (IGP)

has only relied on the concise report of the PVC which he has submitted to Court marked 46

R 3. That is only a table from which one can discern the following reason as the basis for the

2 Paragraphs 3 and 5 of the Amended Petition dated 24-06-2022. 3 Order by the IGP dated 13-01-2000 (P 1(a)); RTM 330 (CRTM 738) of the IGP dated 11-01-2019 (P 1(b)); RTM 153 (CRTM 271) by the IGP dated 04-06-2020 (P 1(c)).

[SC FR 292/2021] - Page 17 of 18

conclusion by the PVC in favour of the 48th Respondent for the backdating of his promotion

to operate with effect from 01-01-2014.

The above chart shows clearly that the sole reason for the recommendation by the PVC is the

fact that the 48th Respondent has had to serve in the Kalkuda Police Station. Obviously, the

Petitioners also must have served in some Police Station during the relevant time and so as

any other Police Officer. I am unable to understand how the 48th Respondent could have been

treated as politically victimized when he was directed to serve in a Police Station upon a

transfer. The backdating of the promotion of the 48th Respondent to operate with effect from

01-01-2014 would make the 48th Respondent about six years senior to the Petitioners. This is

because both the Petitioners and the 48th Respondent have been promoted to the rank of

Chief Inspector of Police on the same day i.e., with effect from on 01-01-2020. Thus, I am

unable to accept the fact that the 48th Respondent has been politically victimized and I am

also unable to accept that as a ground to justify the backdating of his promotion. Therefore,

I am of the view that the Cabinet of Ministers could not have lawfully approved the

implementation of the backdating of the promotion of the 48th Respondent to operate with

effect from 01-01-2014.

There are other issues regarding the legality of the very establishment of the committee

comprising of the 1st to 4th Respondents to form themselves as “the Political Victimization

Committee.” However, as the Petitioners have restricted their case particularly at argument

stage only to challenge on the above basis, the backdating of the promotion of the 48th

Respondent to operate with effect from 01-01-2014, I will not endeavour to engage in further

discussion with regard to the legality of this Committee.

For the foregoing reasons, the Petitioners are entitled to succeed in their endeavour to have

the backdating of the promotion of the 48th Respondent to operate with effect from 01-01-

2014 quashed. I therefore grant a declaration that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners

[SC FR 292/2021] - Page 18 of 18

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been infringed by the action of the

executive to backdate the promotion of the 48th Respondent to operate with effect from 01-

01-2014. I quash the recommendation of the PVC to backdate the promotion of 48th

Respondent to operate with effect from 01-01-2014; I quash the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers thereto; I quash the decision of the PSC to implement it; and I quash its

implementation by the IGP.

This Court on the date it concluded the argument of this case also decided to grant Leave to

Proceed to the Petition in SC FR 159/2022. The Court on that day observed that both these

cases (SC FR 292/2021 and SC FR 159/2022) have been listed together right through to be

taken up together before one Bench. This was pursuant to previous orders made by Court.

When the learned Counsel for the Petitioners in SC FR 159/2022 supported that case for Leave

to Proceed, the learned Deputy Solicitor General at the outset informed Court that he would

not object to granting of Leave to Proceed in that case on the basis that this Court in SC FR

404/2016,4 had decided the issue with regard to the legality of such Committees.

Having considered the above submissions, the Court on 05-12-2024, decided to grant Leave

to Proceed to the Petitioners in SC FR 159/2022 and thereafter with the concurrence of all

Counsel present in Court, decided to amalgamate both these cases (SC FR 292/2021 and SC

FR 159/2022). Learned Counsel for all the parties in both these cases thereafter concurred

that the Court can pronounce one judgment in respect of both these cases. In the above

circumstances, I direct that this judgment must also apply to the case SC FR 159/2022.
