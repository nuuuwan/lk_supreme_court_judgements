"action accordingly.1"
"It is pursuant to the above Cabinet Decision that the Public Service Commission (33rd to 43rd"
"Respondents)  by  its  letter  dated  20-08-2021  bearing  No.  PSC/EST/05-03/04/2021  (marked"
"46R 4), informed the Ministry of Public Security to implement the said recommendation by"
"the  PVC.  The  46th  Respondent  who  is  the  Inspector  General  of  Police  has  annexed  to  his"
"affidavit, the above documents, i.e., the Cabinet Memorandum; the decision of the Cabinet of"
"Ministers; report of the PVC; the letter by the Public Service Commission; and all the other"
"documents relevant thereto."
"Thereafter,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Security,  by  its  letter  dated  20-08-2021  bearing  No."
"MPS/PVC/CAB/01/2021  (marked  46R  5),  informed  the  Inspector  General  of  Police  (46th"
"Respondent) to take steps to implement the above recommendations."
"Thus, it was the above sequence of events which has prompted the 46th Respondent (IGP) to"
"give effect to the recommendations of the said PVC by way of RTM-761 CRTM 389 dated 26-"
"08-2021 (marked P 2), which ordered the afore-stated backdating of the promotions of the"
"48th to 52nd Respondents, according to the recommendation made by the PVC. Although there"
"are  five  Police  Officers  (the  48th  to  52nd  Respondents)  in  favour  of  whom  the  said  PVC"
"recommendation operates, the primary concern of the twelve Petitioners who filed this case"
"is to get the backdating of the promotion of the 48th Respondent to operate with effect from"
"01-01-2014,  quashed.  It  is  this  action  that  the  Petitioners  complain  as  the  infringement  of"
"their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"Further, the 46th Respondent, by RTM 128 CRTM 53, dated 04-09-2021 (marked P 5), called"
"for  interviews  for  the  posts  of  Assistant  Superintendent  of  Police  (ASP),  for  which  the  48th"
"Respondent has become eligible following the impugned backdating. It was the position of"
"the Petitioners that if a promotion is granted to the 48th Respondent as an ASP, it would cause"
"the Petitioners grave and irreparable injustice. When Court granted the Petitioners Leave to"
"Proceed  against  the  Respondents  on  09-05-2022  in  respect  of  the  alleged  infringement  of"
"their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution, Court has also"
