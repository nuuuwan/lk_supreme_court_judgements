ARGUED ON : 29-04-2024

DECIDED ON : 30-01-2025

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J. Out of the three Petitioners mentioned in the caption, the 1st Petitioner is the Attorney-

at-Law who had filed this Petition on behalf of the 2nd Petitioner who was in detention

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 3 of 19

at the time of filing this Petition. The 2nd Petitioner is a Police Sergeant attached to

the Police Narcotics Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the PNB). The 3rd Petitioner is

the wife of the 2nd Petitioner.

The 2nd Petitioner alleges that he was arrested on 23-06-2020, by the officers of the

Criminal Investigations Department (hereinafter referred to as the CID). The 2nd

Petitioner further alleges that the CID officers gave no reason for his arrest. The 2nd

Petitioner has also alleged that he was thereafter detained under the Prevention of

Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979 as amended (hereinafter referred to as PTA), under

three consecutive Detention Orders each of which was for ninety days. The Petitioners

have stated in the amended Petition dated 18th May 2021, that they have produced

these three consecutive Detention Orders marked P 13(a), P 13(b) and P 13(c).

The 3rd Respondent has produced the same Detention Orders marked 3 R 5, 3 R 6,

3 R 7 and the subsequent Detention Order marked 3 R 8.

In contradistinction to the Petitioners version, the position taken up by the 3rd

Respondent is that it was on 25-06-2020, that the CID had arrested the 2nd Petitioner

and brought the 2nd Petitioner to the premises of the CID on 26-06-2024 for the

purposes of questioning. It is also the position of the 3rd Respondent that the CID

arrested the 2nd Petitioner on 25-06-2020 upon reasonable suspicion of his

involvement in certain crimes.

Upon this Petition being supported, this Court by its Order dated 23-11-2022, had

granted Leave to Proceed in respect of the alleged infringements of the Fundamental

Rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1), 13(2), 13(3),

13(5), 14(1)(g) and 14(1)(h) of the Constitution.

In light of the above assertions, the primary issue I have to address in this proceeding

is the issue as to whether the claim by the 2nd Petitioner that he was arrested by the

CID on 23-06-2020 has been established. It is to the said issue that I would now

turn.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 4 of 19

It is the position of the 2nd Petitioner that he was suddenly placed under arrest,1 along

with four other police officers attached to the PNB, by the 3rd Respondent who had

accompanied several individuals clad in civil attire claiming to be from the CID. The

submission of the learned Counsel who appeared for the Petitioners in the course of

the hearing was that the 2nd Petitioner was arrested on 23-06-2020, while in the

premises of PNB which is his own workplace as averred by the 2nd Petitioner himself

at paragraph 08 of the Written Submissions of the Petitioners.

In order for the Respondents to make an arrest of an officer of the PNB within the

premises of the PNB itself as alleged by the Petitioners, it would undoubtedly follow

that such superior officers of the PNB as required would have been made aware of

the intention to carry out such an arrest and consequently it would only be on the

granting of permission by such superior officers that the 2nd Petitioner would be

arrested. In such circumstances it would be prudent that the Petitioner names such

superior officers of the PNB as Respondents in the instant petition.

However, I observe that the Petitioners have chosen not to name any PNB officer as

a Respondent and also chosen not to attribute any responsibility to any PNB officer

for placing the 2nd Petitioner under arrest inside the PNB premises itself.

As stated above, it is the 2nd Petitioners stated position in this case that he was

arrested while carrying out his duties in the premises of the Police Narcotics Bureau.

Therefore, whoever who was instrumental in placing the 2nd Petitioner under arrest,

had physically kept him in custody within the PNB premises. In such a scenario, the

primary responsibility or at its least, a considerable amount of some shared

responsibility for such illegal act must be placed in the hands of those who are

responsible for the administration of the PNB premises for it is not the case of the

Petitioners that the PNB is a part of the CID. If that is the case, why didnt the

Petitioners make/name any or all officers responsible for the affairs of the PNB as

persons who are responsible for arresting the 2nd Petitioner within the PNB premises.

1 Paragraph 08 of the Written Submissions dated 04th April 2023.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 5 of 19

This lapse on the part of the Petitioners in my view, is fatal to the maintainability of

this Petition. This is because it is those responsible for running the affairs of the PNB

who would not only become responsible for such an act but would also be the best

persons to explain (if such an incident had in fact taken place), the circumstances

under which such incident had occurred within the precincts of the PNB. This is further

aggravated by the fact that the 3rd Respondent has denied that the CID had arrested

the 2nd Petitioner within the PNB premises on 23-06-2020. On the above material, I

am unable to hold that the Petitioners have succeeded in establishing that the 2nd

Petitioner was arrested on 23-06-2020, in the premises of PNB which is his own

workplace.

As a result of the above conclusion, what prevails before me now, is only the position

taken up by the CID that it had arrested the 2nd Petitioner on 25-06-2020 and

subsequently brought the 2nd Petitioner on the next day i.e., on 26-06-2020 to the

CID for questioning. Thus, the next issue I have to decide in this proceeding is the

issue as to whether there was any justification for the CID to cause the arrest of the

2nd Petitioner on 25-06-2020.

Although the CID has arrested the 2nd Petitioner under the provisions of the PTA, let

me first consider the power to arrest a person conferred on a Police officer under the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. Under Section 32(1)(b) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act, a Police Officer is authorized to arrest without a warrant,

any person:

i. who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or

ii. against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or

iii. against whom a credible information has been received or

iv. against whom a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned.

Suffice it to state here at this stage that one CI Ruwan Kumara of the PNB had made

a complaint to the CID disclosing that the 2nd Petitioner, with some other officers of

the PNB were complicit in illicit drug trafficking which is prima facie, a ground to cause

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 6 of 19

the arrest of the 2nd Petitioner even in terms of Section 32(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

As would be shown shortly in this Judgment, the power of arrest under the PTA is

wider than that under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Section 6(1) of the PTA

which is found in its Chapter Investigation of Offences and which is reproduced

below, would show this difference.

Section 6(1) of the PTA.

Any police officer not below the rank of Superintendent or any other police

officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector authorized in writing by him in that

behalf may, without a warrant and with or without assistance and

notwithstanding anything in any other law to the contrary-

(a) arrest any person;

(b) enter and search any premises;

(c) stop and search any individual or any vehicle, vessel, train or

aircraft; and

(d) seize any document or thing,

connected with or concerned in or reasonably suspected of being

connected with or concerned in any unlawful activity.

The phrase emphasized above shows that while Section 32(1)(b) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act has specified the threshold requirement to be a suspicion or

being concerned in any cognizable offence, Section 6 of the PTA has specified

the threshold requirement to be a suspicion or being concerned in a different category

of things identified as an unlawful activity".

The Interpretation Section of the PTA (Section 31) has defined this term in the

following manner.

Section 31 of the PTA.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 7 of 19

unlawful activity" means any action taken or act committed by any means

whatsoever, whether Within or outside Sri Lanka, and whether such action was

taken or act was committed before or after the date of Coming into operation

of all or any of the provision of this Act in the commission or in connection

with the commission of any offence under this Act or any act committed

prior to the date of passing of this Act, which act would, if committed after such

date, constitute an offence under this Act.2

This means that any action taken or act committed, in connection with the commission

of any offence under this Act, would be an unlawful activity. Thus, such action taken

or act committed although on its own may not constitute an offence (therefore would

not constitute a cognizable offence in any case), would still fall under the definition of

an Unlawful Activity, if such action taken or act committed, was done in connection

with the commission of any offence under PTA.

In the case of Dissanayaka v Superintendent Mahara Prison and others,3 Kulatunga,

J. held as follows:

"The expression "unlawful activity" as defined in Section 31 of the (Preven-

tion of Terrorism) Act is of wide import and encompasses any person

whose acts "by any means whatsoever" are connected with "the commis-

sion of any offence under this Act". This would include a person who

has committed an offence under the Act".4

Therefore, one could observe that the threshold requirement under Section 32(1)(b)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act for the existence of a reasonable suspicion or

being concerned of any cognizable offence has been reduced under Section 6(1) of

the PTA to a threshold requirement of the existence of a reasonable suspicion or being

connected with or concerned in any unlawful activity. The said unlawful activity"

2 Emphasis added. 3 1991 (2) SLR 247, 248-249. 4 Emphasis added.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 8 of 19

could be any action taken or act committed by any means whatsoever, in the

commission or in connection with the commission of any offence under this Act.

Let me now consider whether the decision of the 3rd Respondent to proceed to arrest

the 2nd Petitioner, in terms of Section 6(1) of the PTA could be justified.

In Dissanayakas case,5 Kulatunga, J. stated the following to highlight the importance

of examining the material to decide the validity of the arrest.

Nevertheless, it is for the Court to determine the validity of the arrest

objectively. The Court will not surrender its judgement to the executive

for if it did so, the fundamental right to freedom from arbitrary arrest

secured by Article 13(1) of the Constitution will be defeated. The executive

must place sufficient material before the Court to enable the Court to make

a decision, such as the notes of investigation, including the statements of

witnesses, observations etc. without relying on bare statements in

affidavits".

Having that in mind, let me now turn to some of the material placed before Court, by

the 3rd Respondent who was the Officer-in-Charge of the Special Unit of the Criminal

Investigation Department. He is the officer who had conducted the investigation into

the complaint received, from Chief Inspector Ruwan Kumara of the PNB. He has filed

an affidavit explaining the circumstances which led to the arrest of the 2nd Petitioner.

He has also annexed all relevant documentation marked from 3 R 1 to 3 R 11.

Let me now refer to the circumstances which led to the arrest of the 2nd Petitioner. It

was CI Ruwan Kumara of the PNB who had disclosed that the 2nd Petitioner, a Police

Sergeant attached to the PNB who with some other officers of the PNB were complicit

in illicit drug trafficking. It was on that basis that the CID had brought the 2nd Petitioner

to the CID on 26-06-2020. This was because the CID had found the contents revealed

5 Supra.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 9 of 19

from CI Ruwan Kumaras statement credible. It was on that basis that the CID had

proceeded to arrest the 2nd Petitioner as the CID officers had entertained a reasonable

suspicion that the 2nd Petitioner was involved in some unlawful activities within the

meaning of the PTA.

As per the Affidavit of the 3rd Respondent, dated 03rd March 2023, following the arrest

of one Chaminda Daya Priyankara Mallawaratchi alias Tile Chaminda for the possession

of Heroin, preliminary investigations in to the matter gave rise to suspicion that the

2nd Petitioner was involved in drug trafficking, thereby committing an offence under

Section 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. It was further

revealed that the 2nd Petitioner had ties with one Gihan Fonseka (a close associate of

Makadura Madush, whom he says is an infamous member of an organized crime

group) and other drug traffickers in remand. The 3rd Respondent has further averred

in his Affidavit, that the preliminary investigations had disclosed that apart from large

scale drug trafficking, the Petitioner was involved in/concerned with several unlawful

activities including collecting weapons, sale of weapons to members of organised

crime groups, collecting weapons through organised crime groups, promotion of

terrorism, financing or abetting to finance terrorism. It was on that material that the

CID had proceeded to obtain Detention Orders in terms of Section 7 of the PTA. The

3rd Respondent has produced the first Detention Order to detain the 2nd Petitioner for

ninety days from 29-06-2020, marked 3 R 5.

The 3rd Respondent proceeds to detail events of the Petitioners involvement in drug

trafficking and weapons dealings at paragraph 16 of the Affidavit dated 03-03-2023,

which were revealed in the course of the further investigations. The investigating

officers, following such investigations, had recovered a sum of thirty-one million one

hundred and forty-five thousand upon a statement made by the 2nd Petitioner (as

evident through the notes, marked 3 R 3). The said sum of money was found upon

the 2nd Petitioners directions, and is said to be the proceeds from the unlawful activity

which the 2nd Petitioner is alleged to have carried out. The investigations have revealed

that the Petitioner was involved in or has carried out numerous unlawful activities

which include the following:

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 10 of 19

Loading into a vehicle, several bags of Heroin, belonging to one Sub Inspector

of Police, on 30-04-2020 at Matara. The Petitioner is alleged to have distributed

the said bags of Heroin to traffickers at various locations.

Stealing and trafficking of narcotics, which were taken into custody by the SL

Navy and handed over to the PNB.

Selling to organised criminal groups, several hundreds of kilos of Heroin and

five pistols which were taken in to custody by the PNB on 15-05-2020.

Dealing 60-70 kilograms of Heroin with the aforementioned Tile Chaminda and

hiding the said Heroin in his (2nd Petitioners) residence in Daladagama which

was said to have been delivered to a person named Rajitha Asanka.

Substitution of foreign substances in place of Heroin which was taken into

custody by the PNB, and selling the removed Heroin to criminal groups locally

and abroad.

Collecting of weapons (namely T-56 rifles, pistols, bullets, revolvers) with the

involvement of criminal groups.

As per the B-report filed, in case No. B 35602/01/2020 before the Magistrates Court

of Colombo, marked 3 R 9, the investigating officers, apart from the sum of monies

mentioned above, had recovered the following items from the possession of the

suspects including the 2nd Petitioner;

Three T-56 rifles,

Six magazines for T-56 rifles,

Five pistols,

One 0.38 Caliber revolver,

Eighty-one bullets used for T-56 rifles,

Forty 9 mm live ammunition rounds,

Heroin amounting to 11 kilos, 888 grams and 256 milligrams,

Two electronic scales.

The said report shows that the investigations were ongoing with regard to a property

purchased in the name of the 3rd Petitioner (2nd Petitioners wife) for a sum of Rupees

Eight Million, their residence and bank accounts worth Rupees Ten Million. This fact is

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 11 of 19

also evident through examining the B-report relevant to case No. 36128/01/20 before

the Magistrates Court of Colombo produced by the 2nd Petitioner, marked P 10.

It is the position of the 2nd Petitioner (as averred in Paragraphs 22-24 of the Amended

Petition) that his wife financed the above properties using the proceeds from a papaya

plantation run independently by her and also that their residential premises was

obtained by way of a government grant.

However, the only explanation afforded by the 2nd Petitioner as to the manner in which

his wife (3rd Petitioner) came into possession of the above properties is limited to bare

averments in their respective Affidavits. The Petitioners have failed to support these

averments with any other documentary evidence. Further, there is no explanation

given as to origins of the sum of thirty-one million one hundred and forty-five thousand

recovered from the possession of the 2nd Petitioner.

In Dissanayakas case,6 Kulatunga, J. stated that it is not the duty of the Court to

determine whether on the available material the arrest should have been made or

not. This statement is included in the following excerpt taken from that Judgment.

. Where the power to arrest without a warrant is couched in the

language of Section 6(1) of the PTA it is well settled that the validity of

the arrest is determined by applying the objective test. This is so whether

the arrest is under the normal law....., under the Emergency

Regulations..... or under the P.T.A. However, it is not the duty of the Court

to determine whether on the available material the arrest should have

been made or not. The question for the Court is whether there was

material for a reasonable officer to cause the arrest.... Proof of the

commission of the offence is not required; a reasonable suspicion or a

reasonable complaint of the commission of the offence suffices.....

6 Supra.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 12 of 19

In my view, having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, the explanation

offered by the 2nd Petitioner and his wife as to why so much of cash and valuable

properties were found in their possession by the CID team, is not strong enough to

dispel the existence of the reasonable suspicion entertained by the 3rd Respondent

that the 2nd Petitioner could be reasonably suspected of or be concerned in any

unlawful activity. Moreover, I must also be mindful that the time at which the 3rd

Respondent had entertained the afore-said reasonable suspicion was the time of the

arrest of the 2nd Petitioner and the said reasonable suspicion was confirmed by the

subsequent investigations conducted and the recoveries from the possession of the

2nd Petitioner.

While the credibility of the witnesses must be left for the trial Court, I am unable at

this stage, to accept the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners that the

CID or PNB had fabricated evidence against the Petitioner. As has already been stated

above, the Petitioners have not made PNB officers as Respondents in their Petition. I

have no reason not to allow the law to take its own course in this instance. In these

circumstances, I hold that the arrest of the 2nd Petitioner caused by the CID is justified

in terms of Section 6(1) of the PTA.

Another argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners is that it was

unlawful for the CID not to have produced the 2nd Petitioner before any Court of law

up until the filing of the Amended Petition dated 18-05-2021.7 This is, therefore, the

submission made by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners that the CID had failed to

produce the 2nd Petitioner before a competent Court within the time limits specified

either under the PTA or ordinary law (Section 37, CCPA).

It is necessary first to reproduce here, Section 7 of the PTA which deals with the

applicable law pertaining to the stage at which a person arrested under Section 6(1)

of the PTA must be produced before a Magistrate.

7 Para 40 of the Amended Petition dated, 18-05-2021.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 13 of 19

Section 7 of the PTA:

(1) Any person arrested under subsection (1) of section 6 may be kept in

custody for a period not exceeding seventy-two hours and shall, unless a

detention order under section 9 has been made in respect of such person,

be produced before a Magistrate before the expiry of such period and the

Magistrate shall, on an application made in writing in that behalf by a

police officer not below the rank of Superintendent, make order that such

person be remanded until the conclusion of the trial of such person :

Provided that, where the Attorney-General consents to the release, of such

person from custody before the conclusion of the trial, the Magistrate shall

release such person from custody.

(2) Where any person connected with or concerned in or reasonably

suspected to be connected with or concerned in the commission of any

offence under this Act appears or is produced before any court other than

in the manner referred to in subsection (1), such court shall order the

remand of such person until the conclusion of the trial:

Provided that, if an application is made under the hand of a police officer

not below the rank of Superintendent to keep such person in police

custody for a period not exceeding seventy-two hours, the Magistrate shall

authorise such custody and thereupon the order of remand made by the

Magistrate shall remain suspended for the period during which such

person is in police custody.

(3) A police officer conducting an investigation under this Act in respect

of any person arrested under subsection (1) of section 6 or remanded

under subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section-

(a) shall have the right of access to such person and the right to take such

person during reasonable hours to any place for the purpose of

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 14 of 19

interrogation and from place to place for the purposes of investigation;

and

(b) may obtain a specimen of the handwriting of such person and do all such

acts as may reasonably be necessary for fingerprinting or otherwise

identifying such person;

In the case of Weerawansa v The Attorney-General and others,8 Fernando, J. held

that if a Detention Order under section 9(1) is obtained within 72 hours of arrest,

there is no necessity to produce the detainee before the Magistrate. In Fernando Js

words, it is as follows:

If a Detention Order under section 9(1) is obtained within 72 hours of

arrest, non-production before a judicial officer is excused by section 7(1).

However, I must also mention here for the sake of completeness that in Weerawansas

case, Fernando, J. went on to hold that the CID had no right to keep the Petitioner in

that case in custody without producing him before a Magistrate, in terms of Section

7(1) as Court had not accepted the assertion by the Respondent in that case that the

Petitioner had been arrested by the CID in accordance with Section 6(1) of the PTA.

As stated above, the CID had arrested the 2nd Petitioner on 25-06-2020. The CID as

per Section 7(1) of the PTA has kept the 2nd Petitioner in custody for a period not

exceeding seventy-two hours. Thereafter, the CID had kept him in custody till the

Detention Order dated 29-06-2020 (3 R 5) was made in terms of Section 9 of the

PTA. Thus, the said period of custody in CID has not exceeded seventy-two hours as

per Section 6(1) of the PTA. Therefore, there is no violation of law by the CID in that

instance.

Another argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners is that some

of the Detention Orders issued against the 2nd Petitioner are not valid. The 2nd

8 2000 (1) SLR 387.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 15 of 19

Petitioner was detained under four consecutive Detention Orders, i.e., the detention

orders dated 28-06-2020 (3 R 5); the detention order dated 25-09-2020 (3 R 6); the

detention order dated 25-12-2020 (3 R 7); the detention order dated 25-03-2021 (3

R 8) produced by the 3rd Respondent.9

Let me now reproduce below, Section 9 of the PTA which empowers the Minister to

order the detention of a person connected with or concerned in any unlawful activity.

Section 9 of the PTA (Detention Orders)

1) Where the Minister has reason to believe or suspect that any person is

connected with or concerned in any unlawful activity, the Minister may order

that such person be detained for a period not exceeding three months in the

first instance, in such place and subject to such conditions as may be

determined by the Minister, and any such order may be extended from time to

time for a period not exceeding three months at a time:

Provided, however, that the aggregate period of such detention shall not

exceed a period of eighteen months.

2)

(a) At any time after an order has been made in respect of any person under

subsection (1), the Minister may direct that the operation of such order be

suspended and may make an order under subsection (1) of section 11.

(b) The Minister may revoke any such direction if he is satisfied that the person in

respect of whom the direction was made has failed to observe any condition

imposed or that the operation of the order can no longer remain suspended

without detriment to public safety.

9 The 2nd Petitioner has purported to have produced these Detention Orders, marked P 13(a), P 13(b)

and P 13(c).

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 16 of 19

In Weerawansas case10, Fernando, J. took the following view:

"Not only must the Minister of Defence, subjectively, have the required

belief or suspicion, but there must also be, objectively, 'reason' for

such belief.

I have already adverted to above, the material placed against the 2nd Petitioner. I am

of the view that the said material is sufficient to pass on the objective test, the decision

made by the Minister of Defence that there was sufficient basis for the issuance of the

Detention Order.

The leaned Counsel for the 2nd Petitioner also advanced another argument with regard

to the validity of the Detention Orders marked 3 R 5, 3 R 6, 3 R 7 and 3 R 8. It is

the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners that it is only the Minster of

Defence who has been empowered in terms of Section 9(1) of the PTA, to make

Detention Orders. It is also his submission that some of the Detention Orders [marked

3 R 5, 3 R 6] issued to detain the 2nd Petitioner have been signed by the President

and therefore not valid in law.

I observe that the designation of the signatory of the Detention Orders marked 3 R 5

and 3 R 6, has been mentioned on those two Detention Orders as President and

the designation of the signatory of the Detention Orders marked 3 R 7 and 3 R 8 has

been mentioned therein as President and Minister of Defence.

While it is correct that Section 9(1) of the PTA empowers the Minster of Defence to

issue detention orders I cannot forget the fact that in terms of Article 44(3) of the

Constitution it is always the President who must hold the portfolio of the Minister of

Defence in this country.

10 Supra at page 378.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 17 of 19

Further, Article 44(3) of the Constitution requires that the position of the Minister in

charge of the subject of Defence be filled by the President. It is as follows:

(3) The President shall be the Minister in charge of the subject of

Defence and may exercise, perform and discharge the powers, duties and

functions of any Minister of the Cabinet of Ministers or any Minister who is

not a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, subject to the provisions of the

Constitution, for not exceeding fourteen days during a period within which

any subject or function is not assigned to any such Minister under the

provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article or under paragraph (1) of Article

45 and accordingly, any reference in the Constitution or any written law to

the Minster to whom such subject or function is assigned, shall be read and

construed as a reference to the President:

Provided however, preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not

preclude the President from assigning any subject or function to himself in

consultation with the Prime Minister and accordingly, any reference in the

Constitution or any written law to the Minister to whom such subject or

function is assigned, shall be read and construed as a reference to the

President. [emphasis added]

In SC/SD/06/2001, this Court in determining the Constitutionality of the Seventeenth

Amendment to the Constitution, stated obiter regarding the exercise of the functions

of Minister of Defence, which is as follows:

The relevant provision as to the exercise of the sovereignty of the People in

relation to executive power is contained in Article 4(b), which reads thus:

executive power of the People, including the defence of Sri Lanka, shall

be exercised by the President of the Public elected by the People,

Therefore the executive power of the People including defend [sic] is exercised

[by] the president of [the] Republic who is elected by the People.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 18 of 19

Therefore, I am satisfied that the Detention Orders have been issued by the Minster

of Defence who was also the President of the Country at that time.

The condition precedent to the issuance of the Detention Order is that the issuer, the

Minister of Defence, must have been satisfied that there were adequate grounds to

detain the 2nd Petitioner. In the instant case, it was just the same individual who held

the posts of both the President and the Minister of Defence of the country. Therefore,

irrespective of the designation written underneath the signature, it was the same

individual who had signed. The said individual should have signed the Detention

Orders after being satisfied that there were adequate grounds to detain the 2nd

Petitioner. Therefore, the main issue for the validity of the Detention Orders would be

whether there were such grounds for the issuer to detain the 2nd Petitioner in custody.

This is because the person who had signed the Detention Orders was indeed the

Minister of Defence. I have no basis or justification to hold the Detention Orders,

marked 3 R 5 and 3 R 6, are invalid merely because the designation of the issuer

has been mentioned as the President and not as the Minister of Defence in the

Detention Orders, marked 3 R 5 and 3 R 6. Moreover, I am of the view that this

argument is so technical in nature and is not capable of persuading me to declare

these Detention Orders invalid on that basis, particularly in view of the material

available against the 2nd Petitioner calling for the necessity to detain him in custody

pending investigation into very serious crimes.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Respondents have not infringed any of the

Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners guaranteed by the Constitution. In the above

circumstances, the Petitioners are not entitled to succeed with their Petition. I proceed

to dismiss this Petition with costs.

The Petitioner in this Petition has stated that he was placed under interdiction on the

allegations some of which were discussed in the course of this Judgment.11 However,

in the course of the argument, Court was informed by the learned counsel who

11 Paragraph 20 of the Petition dated 04-03-2021.

[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 19 of 19

appeared for the Petitioner that the Petitioner has been reinstated and therefore has

resumed working as a Police officer but neither the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

nor the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General has offered any explanation acceptable

to Court as to how a person who is suspected to be concerned with offences of that

magnitude came to be re-employed as a Police officer. I cannot forget the fact that

the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General resisted this application against granting

relief to the Petitioner on the basis that there is evidence to justify both his arrest and

detention. I cannot turn a blind eye to the above situation. Therefore, I direct the

Inspector General of Police to look in to those matters with a view of deciding the

legality/ suitability of allowing the Petitioner to continue to be employed as a Police

officer. The 6th Respondent is also directed to examine the relevant facts pertaining

to the aforesaid aspects and consider giving necessary advices to the Inspector

General of Police.
