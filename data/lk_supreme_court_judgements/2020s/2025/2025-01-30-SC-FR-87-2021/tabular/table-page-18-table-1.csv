"[SC FR 87/2021] - Page 18 of 19"
"Therefore, I am satisfied that the Detention Orders have been issued by the Minster"
"of Defence who was also the President of the Country at that time."
"T
he condition precedent to the issuance of the Detention Order is that the issuer, the"
"Minister of Defence, must have been satisfied that there were adequate grounds to"
"detain the 2nd Petitioner. In the instant case, it was just the same individual who held"
"the posts of both the President and the Minister of Defence of the country. Therefore,"
"irrespective  of  the  designation  written  underneath  the  signature,  it  was  the  same"
"individual  who  had  signed.  The  said  individual  should  have  signed  the  Detention"
"Orders  after  being  satisfied  that  there  were  adequate  grounds  to  detain  the  2nd"
"Petitioner. Therefore, the main issue for the validity of the Detention Orders would be"
"whether there were such grounds for the issuer to detain the 2nd Petitioner in custody."
"This  is  because  the  person  who  had  signed  the  Detention  Orders  was  indeed  the"
"Minister  of  Defence.  I  have  no  basis  or  justification  to  hold  the  Detention  Orders,"
"marked 3 R 5 and 3 R 6, are invalid merely because the designation of the issuer"
"has  been  mentioned  as  the  President  and  not  as  the  Minister  of  Defence  in  the"
"Detention Orders, marked 3 R 5 and 3 R 6. Moreover, I am of the view that this"
"argument  is  so  technical  in  nature and  is  not  capable  of  persuading  me  to  declare"
"these  Detention  Orders  invalid  on  that  basis,  particularly  in  view  of  the  material"
"available against the 2nd Petitioner calling for the necessity to detain him in custody"
"pending investigation into very serious crimes."
"For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Respondents have not infringed any of the"
"Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners guaranteed by the Constitution. In the above"
"circumstances, the Petitioners are not entitled to succeed with their Petition. I proceed"
"to dismiss this Petition with costs."
"T
he Petitioner in this Petition has stated that he was placed under interdiction on the"
"allegations some of which were discussed in the course of this Judgment.11 However,"
"in  the  course  of  the  argument,  Court  was  informed  by  the  learned  counsel  who"
"11 Paragraph 20 of the Petition dated 04-03-2021."
