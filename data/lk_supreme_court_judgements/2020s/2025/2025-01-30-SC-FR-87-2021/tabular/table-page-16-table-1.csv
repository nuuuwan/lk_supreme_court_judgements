"belief or suspicion, but there must also be, objectively, 'reason' for"
"such belief.‚Äù"
"I have already adverted to above, the material placed against the 2nd Petitioner. I am"
"of the view that the said material is sufficient to pass on the objective test, the decision"
"made by the Minister of Defence that there was sufficient basis for the issuance of the"
"Detention Order."
"The leaned Counsel for the 2nd Petitioner also advanced another argument with regard"
"to the validity of the Detention Orders marked 3 R 5, 3 R 6, 3 R 7 and 3 R 8. It is"
"the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners that it is only the Minster of"
"Defence  who  has  been  empowered  in  terms  of  Section  9(1)  of  the  PTA,  to  make"
"Detention Orders. It is also his submission that some of the Detention Orders [marked"
"3 R 5, 3 R 6] issued to detain the 2nd Petitioner have been signed by the President"
"and therefore not valid in law."
