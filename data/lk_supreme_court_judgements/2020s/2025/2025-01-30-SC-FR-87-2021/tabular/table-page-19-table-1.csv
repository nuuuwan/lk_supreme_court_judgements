"appeared for the Petitioner that the Petitioner has been reinstated and therefore has"
"resumed working as a Police officer but neither the learned Counsel for the Petitioner"
"nor the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General has offered any explanation acceptable"
"to Court as to how a person who is suspected to be concerned with offences of that"
"magnitude came to be re-employed as a Police officer. I cannot forget the fact that"
"the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General resisted this application against granting"
"relief to the Petitioner on the basis that there is evidence to justify both his arrest and"
"detention.  I  cannot  turn  a  blind  eye  to  the  above  situation.  Therefore,  I  direct  the"
"Inspector General of Police to look in to  those matters with a view of deciding the"
"legality/ suitability of allowing the Petitioner to continue to be employed as a Police"
"officer. The 6th Respondent is also directed to examine the relevant facts pertaining"
"to  the  aforesaid  aspects  and  consider  giving  necessary  advices  to  the  Inspector"
"General of Police."
