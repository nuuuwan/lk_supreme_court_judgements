"I","n the case of Weerawansa  v The Attorney-General and others,8  Fernando, J. held"
"","that  if  a  Detention  Order  under  section  9(1)  is  obtained  within  72  hours  of  arrest,"
"","there is no necessity to produce the detainee before the Magistrate. In Fernando J’s"

"","Detention Order dated 29-06-2020 (3 R 5) was made in terms of Section 9 of the"

"","per Section 6(1) of the PTA. Therefore, there is no violation of law by the CID in that"

"A","nother argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners is that some"
