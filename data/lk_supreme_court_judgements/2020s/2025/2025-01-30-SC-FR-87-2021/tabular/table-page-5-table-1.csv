"This lapse on the part of the Petitioners in my view, is fatal to the maintainability of"
"this Petition. This is because it is those responsible for running the affairs of the PNB"
"who would not only become responsible for such an act but would also be the best"
"persons  to  explain  (if  such  an  incident  had  in  fact  taken  place),  the  circumstances"
"under which such incident had occurred within the precincts of the PNB. This is further"
"aggravated by the fact that the 3rd Respondent has denied that the CID had arrested"
"the 2nd Petitioner within the PNB premises on 23-06-2020. On the above material, I"
"am  unable  to  hold  that  the  Petitioners  have  succeeded  in  establishing  that  the  2nd"
"Petitioner  was  arrested  on  23-06-2020,  in  the  premises  of  PNB  which  is  his  own"
"workplace."
