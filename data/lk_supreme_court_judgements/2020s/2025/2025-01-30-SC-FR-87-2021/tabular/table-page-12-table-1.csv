"In my view, having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, the explanation"
"offered by the 2nd  Petitioner and his  wife as to why so much of cash and  valuable"
"properties were found in their possession by the CID team, is not strong enough to"
"dispel the existence of the reasonable suspicion entertained by  the 3rd Respondent"
"that  the  2nd  Petitioner  could  be  reasonably  suspected  of  or  be  concerned  in  any"
"unlawful  activity.  Moreover,  I  must  also  be  mindful  that  the  time  at  which  the  3rd"
"Respondent had entertained the afore-said reasonable suspicion was the time of the"
"arrest of the 2nd Petitioner and the said reasonable suspicion was confirmed by the"
"subsequent investigations conducted and the recoveries from the possession of the"
"2nd Petitioner."
