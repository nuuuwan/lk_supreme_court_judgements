Before: Hon. S. Thurairaja, PC, J.

Hon. Janak De Silva, J. Hon. K. Priyantha Fernando, J.

Counsel:

Saliya Pieris PC with Thanuka Nandasiri for the Petitioner

Sureka Ahmed SSC for the 1st, 2nd, 17th, 27th and 28th Respondents

Written Submissions tendered on: 27.03.2025 by the Petitioner 03.05.2023 by the Respondents Argued on: 11.03.2025 Decided on: 30.05.2025

Janak De Silva, J. The Petitioner is a Trade Union registered under Section 10 of the Trade Union Ordinance

No. 14 of 1935 as amended (Ordinance). It claims to represent Development Coordinators

recruited under the 1999 Graduate Scheme.

The Petitioner claims that Development Coordinators were recruited along with Child

Rights Promotion Officers and Social Services Officers and others as more fully set out in

the petition.

The core complaint of the Petitioner is that despite having identical qualifications and

appointed under the same scheme, the Development Coordinators were placed on MN-

4 salary scale while the others were placed on the higher salary scale MN-5.

The Petitioner complains that the fundamental rights of the Petitioner and that of its

members guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been infringed for one or

more of the following reasons:

1. Failure to formulate an acceptable Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion for the

Development Coordinators;

Page 10 of 25

2. Failure to place Development Coordinators in the category of "Field/Office Based

Officers";

3. Failure to place them in salary code MN-5 or MN-6 in the new Scheme of

Recruitment;

4. Failure to place them in the same salary code as the one applicable to Child Rights

Promotion Officers; and

5. Failure to allow the Development Coordinators to apply for the Limited

Competitive Examination to the Sri Lanka Planning Service Class II/II or to the Sri

Lanka Administrative Service Class III.

The Respondents deny any violation of the fundamental rights of the Development

Coordinators and have set out in some detail the steps taken to formulate a scheme of

recruitment and promotion for them as well as opening of other promotional prospects.

The Respondents have in addition raised a preliminary objection that the Petitioner has

no locus standi to have and maintain this application.

I will first address the preliminary objection as an answer in the affirmative negates the

need to consider the merits of this application.

Article 126 (2) of the Constitution reads as follows:

“Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language right

relating to such person has been infringed or is about to be infringed by executive

or administrative action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law on his behalf,

within one month thereof, in accordance with such rules of Court as may be in force,

apply to the Supreme Court by way of a petition in writing addressed to such

Court…” (emphasis added)

It is a trite rule of interpretation that when the words of the Constitution are clear, precise

and unambiguous and there is no absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of

the Constitution, the words themselves most accurately declare the intention of the

designers of the Constitution.

The intention of the framers of the Constitution is clear. The locus standi for filing a

fundamental rights application was limited to any person whose fundamental rights or

language rights has been or about to be infringed or an attorney-at-law on his behalf.

Page 11 of 25

The Court has not been dogmatic in its approach to constitutional interpretation. It has

followed a pragmatic approach and resorted to several interpretative rules in interpreting

the Constitution. Some of them are:

(1) Original intent [See Somawathie v. Weerasinghe (1990) 2 Sri LR 121].

(2) Textualist [See Somawathie (supra. at 128), S.C. Reference No. 3/2012; Attorney

General v. Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake and Others (S.C. Appeal 67/2013, S.C.M.

21.02.2014). For US approach, see Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S.

871 (1990), where the US Supreme Court insisted standing must satisfy Article III’s

literal requirements, narrowing associational suits absent direct member injury.

See also Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330 (2016)].

(3) Organic [See Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill [Decisions of the Supreme

Court on Parliamentary Bills (1991-2003) Vol. VII page 389. For US approach see

Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167

(2000)].

(4) Hybrid [See R. Sambanthan and Others v. Attorney General and Others (S.C. (F/R)

Nos. 351-356, 358-361/2018, S.C.M. 13.12.2018 at page 64)].

(5) Structuralism [See Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution (2002) [Decisions

of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (1991-2003) Vol. VII page 311;

Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution (2015) [Decisions of the Supreme

Court on Parliamentary Bills (2014-2015) Vol. XII page 26; R. Sambanthan (supra);

Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake (supra) at 18].

(6) Consequences/Prudence [See Sriyani Silva v. Iddamalgoda, Officer-in-Charge,

Police Station, Payagala and Others (Sriyani Silva 2) (2003) 2 Sri LR 63 at 76].

(7) Practices [See Edward Francis William Silva PC and three others v. Shirani

Bandaranayake and three others [(1997) 1 Sri LR 92 at page 94].

(8) Rule of Law [See R. Sambanthan (supra) at 66].

Original intention is an accepted rule of constitutional interpretation. By its application, a

court seeks to ascertain the original meaning ascribed to constitutional provisions by its

framers.

Page 12 of 25

In Somawathie [supra] the petitioner complained of the infringement of the fundamental

rights guaranteed by Articles 11 and 13 of the Constitution. The complaint was not based

on the violation of the petitioner's own rights. It was based on the violation of the rights

of her husband who was alive but in custody at the time the proceedings were instituted.

Although the petitioner in that application was the wife of the detainee, the petition was

accompanied by an affidavit of the detainee.

Amarasinghe, J. (with T.D. Bandaranayake, J. agreeing) held (at page 124):

““How should the words of this provision of the Constitution be construed? It

should be construed according to the intent of the makers of the Constitution.

Where, as in the Article before us, the words are in themselves precise and

unambiguous and there is no absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency with the rest

of the Constitution, the words themselves do best declare that intention. No more

can be necessary than to expound those words in their plain, natural, ordinary,

grammatical and literal sense.” (emphasis added)

Amarasinghe, J. went on to hold (ibid.) that:

“… Article 126 (2) confers a recognized position only upon the person whose

fundamental rights are alleged to have been violated and upon an attorney-at-

law acting on behalf of such a person. No other person has a right to apply to the

Supreme Court for relief or redress in respect of the alleged infringement of

fundamental rights.” (emphasis added)

However, Kulatunga, J. dissented and held (at page 133) that a strict construction of

Article 126(2) is not warranted at all in the circumstances of the case. He went on to hold

that if fundamental rights are to have any meaning particularly to the weak and the

helpless person whose freedom to have prompt recourse to this Court by himself or by an

Attorney-at-Law is impeded due to circumstances beyond his control, it is the duty of this

Court to construe Article 126(2) purposively and not literally.

Kulatunga, J. was of the view that this would not do violence to the intention of the

legislature and even if there be a doubt in that regard, he would resolve it in favour of a

construction which would advance the remedy for violation of fundamental rights,

provided by Article 17 of the Constitution. However, it must be added that Kulatunga, J.

Page 13 of 25

(at page 132) was of the view that Article 126(2) did not allow the Court to entertain public

interest petitions.

Nevertheless, in Sriyani Silva v. Iddamalgoda, Officer-in-Charge, Police Station,

Payagala and Others [(2003) 1 Sri LR 14 at 21] (Sriyani Silva 1), Shirani Bandaranayake,

J. (as she was then) (with S.N. Silva, C.J. agreeing) took a slightly different view in the

circumstances of the case and went on to hold that:

“[…] when there is a casual link between the death of a person and the process

which constitutes the infringement of such person’s fundamental rights, any one

having a legitimate interest could prosecute that right in a proceeding instituted

in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution. There would be no objection in limine

to the wife of the deceased instituting proceedings in the circumstances of this

case.” (emphasis added)

The factual position in that case was that on 12.6.2000 the husband of the petitioner was

arrested and kept in custody at the Payagala Police Station where he remained in custody

until he was produced before the Magistrate on 17.06.2000 when he was remanded to

prison. On 20.6.2000 he died at the Remand Prison. There was prima facie evidence

including medical evidence that the deceased was assaulted whilst in prison custody and

his death resulted by reason of such assault.

A petition was filed on 18.7.2000 on behalf of the petitioner (the deceased detainee). On

23.8.2000, the day it was for support, the Court allowed counsel to amend the petition by

substituting the widow of the deceased as the petitioner.

At the hearing of the application two preliminary objections were raised on behalf of the

respondents. One was that the petitioner had no locus standi to make the application in

view of Article 126(2) of the Constitution which provides that the person whose rights are

infringed may by himself or by an attorney-at-law apply for relief. The right is personal to

the aggrieved person. A legal representative cannot initiate proceedings under Article

126(2) on behalf of a deceased.

The majority in overruling the preliminary objection, disregarded the original intent as

ascribed by Amerasinghe J. in Somawathie (supra) and sought to provide an expansive

Page 14 of 25

interpretation to Article 126(2) of the Constitution having regard to the consequences of

adopting an original intent or textual interpretation.

Shirani Bandaranayake, J. sought to explain (at page 21) the reasoning for her conclusion

as follows:

“Consequently, the deceased detainee, who was arrested, detained and allegedly

tortured, and who met with his death subsequently, had acquired a right under the

Constitution to seek redress from this Court for the alleged violation of his

fundamental rights. It could never be contended that the right ceased and would

become ineffective due to the intervention of the death of the person, especially in

circumstances where the death in itself is the consequence of injuries that

constitute the infringement. If such an interpretation is not given it would result in

a preposterous situation in which a person who is tortured and survives could

vindicate his rights in proceedings before this Court, but if the torture is so intensive

that it results in death, the right cannot be vindicated in proceedings before this

Court. In my view a strict literal construction should not be resorted to where it

produces such an absurd result. Law, in my view, should be interpreted to give effect

to the right and to suppress the mischief.”

Edussuriya, J. dissented and held (at page 27) that the intention of the legislature under

Article 126(2) was to grant relief only to the person whose fundamental rights had been

violated. He further held that Article 17 read with Article 126(2) provides a remedy to

those whose fundamental rights have been infringed and Article 126(2) categorically

states that the person whose fundamental rights have been infringed, himself or by an

attorney-at-law on his behalf should make an application for redress. He was of the view

that there is nothing therein which even remotely suggests that a widow has such a right

or that such right devolves on a widow or heirs of a person whose fundamental rights

have been infringed. In the circumstances he concluded that it would be preposterous on

the part of Court to hold that the legislature intended that the right to apply for redress

should pass to the heirs or that the heirs of a deceased whose fundamental rights had

been infringed were entitled to apply for relief under Article 126 (2).

Page 15 of 25

I am in respectful agreement with the majority judgment and reasons given therein for

resorting to an expansive or liberal interpretation of Article 126(2) rather than an original

or textual interpretation as such an approach would have led to an absurd interpretation.

All what law enforcement officers have to do to avoid a challenge to their unlawful acts is

to ensure that the person whose fundamental rights they infringed is not alive to

prosecute such an application.

However, it must be noted that Shirani Bandaranayake, J. did not attempt to lay down a

broad principle in allowing any person to institute a fundamental rights application on

behalf of a third party. Instead, much reliance was placed on the circumstances of the

case in holding that the wife of the deceased was entitled to prosecute the fundamental

right of the deceased where there is a casual link between the death of a person and the

process which constitutes the infringement of such person’s fundamental rights.

The locus standi of the wife of the deceased in Sriyani Silva 1 (supra) was revisited by a

different bench when the merits of the fundamental rights application were examined in

Sriyani Silva v. Iddamalgoda, Officer-in-Charge, Police Station, Payagala and Others

[(2003) 2 Sri LR 63] (Sriyani Silva 2). Fernando, J. justified a broad interpretation to Article

126(2) of the Constitution to permit the lawful heirs and/or dependents of the deceased

to institute proceedings for the following reasons:

1. Articles 11 and 13(4) by necessary implication recognize the right to life. Hence if a

person died by reason of torture or unlawful death (by the executive) the right of

any person to complain against violation of a fundamental right guaranteed by

Article 17 read with Article 126(2) should not be interpreted to make the right

illusory. Article 126(2) should be interpreted broadly especially in view of Article

4(d) which requires the court to "respect, secure and advance" fundamental rights.

2. The deceased's fundamental rights under Articles 11, 13(2) and 17 were infringed

by the 2nd respondent and by the 1st respondent on the ground of culpable inaction

to monitor the activities of his subordinates. The deceased's rights accrued or

devolved on the petitioner and their minor child. The deceased was put to death

"in order to prevent him totally and permanently from complaining." On that

ground also Article 126(2) should be interpreted expansively.

Page 16 of 25

3. Article 11 guarantees freedom from torture and from cruel and inhuman treatment

or punishment. Unlawfully to deprive a person of life, without his consent or

against his will, would certainly be inhuman treatment, for life is an essential pre-

condition for being human. In any event, if torture or cruel treatment or

punishment is so extreme that death results, to hold that no one other than the

victim can complain will result in the same anomalies, inconsistencies and injustice

as in the case of Articles 13(4) and 17.

4. Article 11 [read with Article 13(4)], recognises a right not to deprive of life, whether

by way of punishment or otherwise and, by necessary implication, a right to life.

That right must be interpreted broadly, and the jurisdiction conferred by the

Constitution on this Court for the sole purpose of protecting fundamental rights

against executive action must be deemed to have conferred all that is reasonably

necessary for this Court to protect those rights effectively.

I have no doubt that the reasons given for a broad interpretation of Article 126(2) is well

founded in the circumstances of the case. Nevertheless, I do not read Sriyani Silva 2 to

have expanded the test of locus standi beyond Sriyani Silva 1. The conclusions in both

cases are specific to the circumstances where the death of the deceased, resulting from

the actions or inactions of the executive, prevented him from impugning such executive

actions or inactions. In such circumstances, the lawful heirs and/or dependents of the

deceased have a right to institute fundamental rights proceedings to vindicate the rights

of the deceased.

The liberal interpretation of Article 126(2) adopted in Sriyani Silva 1 (supra) and Sriyani

Silva 2 (supra) was reaffirmed in Lama Hewage Lal (deceased) & Rani Fernando (wife of

deceased Lal) v. OIC, Minor Offences, Seeduwa Police Station & Others [(2005) 1 Sri LR

40]. In that case, the deceased suffered fatal injuries due to an assault whilst he was in

the custody of the prison authorities. The petition was filed by the wife and his three

minor children.

Shirani Bandaranayake, J. held (at page 45) as follows:

“The question on ‘locus stand’ has been considered by this Court not only in the

decision which considered the preliminary objection in Kotabadu Durage Sriyani

Page 17 of 25

Silva (Supra), but also in the final hearing of the same case (Supra). It is therefore

settled law that the lawful heirs and/or dependents of a person who is deceased

as a result of an act of torture should be entitled to a declaration of the violation

and compensation.” (emphasis added)

Moreover, in Mohammed Rashid Fathima Sharmila v. K.W.G. Nishantha & Others [S.C.

F.R. Application No. 398/2008, S.C.M. 03.02.2023 at page 5), Aluwihare, P.C., J.

reaffirming the same liberal interpretation for Article 126(2), held that:

“ Earlier, the position pertaining to locus standi was that a Petitioner can complain

only of the violation of his or her own fundamental rights. Action could only be filed

by the Petitioner or by an Attorney-at-law acting on the Petitioner’s behalf, as per

a “plain, natural, ordinary, grammatical and literal” reading of Article 126(2)

(Somawathie v Weerasinghe (1990) 2 Sri LR 121 at 124). Subsequently, however,

with the pronouncement of the principles laid down by Fernando J. in the case of

Kotabadu Durage Sriyani Silva v Chanaka Iddamalgoda, Officer-in-Charge, Police

Station Payagala (2003) 1 Sri LR 14, it is now well-established and solidified law

that the next of kin has a right to sue on behalf of the deceased, in order to uphold

the right to life implicit in Article 13(4).” (emphasis added)

Hence where the death of the deceased was brought about by executive or administrative

actions or inactions of persons responsible for the violation of the fundamental rights of

the deceased, the right of the next of kin to institute a fundamental rights application to

vindicate such rights of the deceased is now firmly established. However, this principle

does not assist the Petitioner in establishing its locus standi in this application.

Similarly, it is now firmly established that public interest litigation has been recognized by

the Supreme Court in the exercise of its fundamental rights jurisdiction [See Bulankulama

& Others v. Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development & Others (2000) 3 Sri LR 243;

Vasudeva Nanayakkara v. Choksy & Others (John Keells Case) (2008) 1 Sri LR 134;

Sugathapala Mendis & Another v. Chandrika Kumaratunga & Others (2008) 2 Sri LR 339;

Ravindra Gunawardena Kariyawasam v. Central Environment Authority & Others

(S.C..F.R. Application No. 141/2015, S.C.M. 04.04.2019), Ceylon Electricity Board

Page 18 of 25

Accountants’ Association v. Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka & Others (S.C.F.R.

Application No. 18/2015, S.C.M. 03.05.2016 at 14-15].

However, one must bear in mind that the acceptance of public interest litigation is not an

acknowledgment of the right of any person to vindicate the fundamental rights of a third

party. On the contrary, it is an acknowledgment of the right of any person to institute a

fundamental rights application to vindicate a fundamental right he enjoys with the rest of

the community.

Nevertheless, the present application is not framed as a public interest litigation and

indeed cannot be so characterized anyway. The Petitioner claims that due to the

impugned actions and inactions, the fundamental rights of the Petitioner Trade Union as

well as that of its members have been violated. None of the members of the Trade Union

have been included as Petitioners. I do not find any material to support the claim that the

fundamental rights of the Petitioner have been infringed. Its claim arises from the

allegation that the fundamental rights of its members, namely Development Coordinators

have been infringed.

I must add in passing that the recognition by the Supreme Court of the availability of public

interest litigation to espouse fundamental rights is in harmony with comparative

developments in India and England.

The Supreme Court of India has adopted a liberal interpretation to recognize the

availability of public interest litigation to advance fundamental rights enjoyed by the

citizenry [See Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (A.I.R. 1984 S.C. 802); Maharaj

Singh v Uttara Pradesh (A.I.R. 1976 S.C. 2602); S.P. Gupta v Union of India (A.I.R. 1982

S.C. 149)].

The English Courts have invoked the remedy of actio popularis, which derives from Roman

Law, to broaden the status of standing in suitable cases [See R v. Inland Revenue

Commissioners’ ex-parte National Federation of Self-Employment and Small Businesses

Our jurisprudence has also evolved to the point of allowing incorporated bodies with legal

personality to vindicate fundamental rights guaranteed to the legal entity by Article 12(1)

of the Constitution [See Janatha Finance & Investments Ltd v. Liyanage & Others (1983)

2 Sri LR 111; Smithkline Beecham Biological S. A. & Another v. State Pharmaceutical

Corporation of Sri Lanka & Others (1997) 3 Sri LR 20; Leader Publications (Pvt) Ltd v.

Ariya Rabasinghe, Director of Information & Competent Authority & Others (2000) 1 Sri

LR 265; Environmental Foundation Limited v. Urban Development Authority of Sri Lanka

(2009) 1 Sri LR 123].

In a long line of cases, it has been clearly held that a corporation sole must be expressly

created by a legislative act [See Land Commissioner v. Ladamuttu Pillai (62 NLR 169 at

174, 182-183); M.R. Singho Mahatmaya v. The Land Commissioner (66 NLR 94); The

Superintendent, Deeside Estate, Maskeliya v. Ilankai Thozhilar Kazhakam (70 NLR 279 at

281); The Superintendent, Nakiadeniya Group, Nakiadeniya v. Cornelishamy (71 NLR

142 at 143); Sri Lanka Transport Board v. Colombo Metropolitan Bus Company and

Others (2008) 1 Sri LR 1 at 7].

The question is whether a registered Trade Union such as the Petitioner has been vested

with legal personality.

In examining this issue, it must be borne in mind that Section 30 of the Ordinance declares

that a registered Trade Union may sue or be sued in its registered name. Moreover,

Section 42 of the Ordinance empowers a registered Trade Union to own property through

its trustees. One may contend that these provisions point to an intention on the part of

the legislature to vest legal personality on a registered Trade Union. Nevertheless, there

is no express provision in the Ordinance vesting legal personality on a registered Trade

Union.

In Ceylon Mercantile Union v. The Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka (80 NLR 309 at 313)

Sharvananda, J. (as he then was) held that although a registered Trade Union has been

endowed by the legislature with many rights characteristic of a Corporation, rights which

an unincorporated Corporation does not possess, a registered Trade Union is not a legal

Page 20 of 25

person. He went on to hold (at page 314) that the legislature has not made any provision

giving legal sanction for a registered Trade Union to institute an action on behalf of its

members in a Court of law.

This decision was cited with approval and followed in Ceylon Electricity Board

Accountants’ Association (supra) where a fundamental rights application was made by a

registered Trade Union on behalf of its members. Sripavan, C.J. went on to hold (at page

15) that in the absence of a specific provision permitting a Trade Union to institute action

on behalf of its members, the petitioner Union (the Trade Union in that case) cannot have

and maintain the application on behalf of its members in terms of Article 17 read with

Article 126(2) of the Constitution and dismissed the application. In doing so, Sripavan, C.J.

emphasized that the application is not a public interest litigation nor has it been filed on

behalf of a group of persons who are in a disadvantaged position by reasons of poverty or

some disability.

In Krishantha Kumara and Others v. Dissanayake and Others [S.C.F.R. Application No.

460/2017, S.C.M. 01.03.2023] a similar objection was raised. There the 4th petitioner was

a registered Trade Union under Section 10 of the Ordinance. The 1st to 3rd petitioners

were office bearers and members of the 4th Trade Union. Court having considered the

decisions in Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants’ Association (supra) and Environmental

Foundation Limited (supra) held (at pages 20-21) that it is clear that the locus standi of

an unincorporated body that comes before Court in an application filed under Article 17

read with Article 12692) is now settled and the Court has permitted the members of the

unincorporated body to pursue the application in the instances when their rights

guaranteed under the Constitution has been violated by the conduct of the respondents.

I observe that the Court has at the end made a declaration that the fundamental rights of

the petitioners have been violated. However, the declaration made in favour of the 4th

petitioner is inconsistent with the conclusion of Court on the preliminary objection. The

ratio of Krishantha Kumara and Others (supra) does not in anyway seek to disturb the

principle established in Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants’ Association (supra). On the

contrary it reaffirms it.

Page 21 of 25

This position was revisited in Engineering Diplomates Association and Others v.

Abeygunasekara and Others [S.C.F.R. Application No. 531/2011, S.C.M. 20.07.2023]

where the 1st and 2nd petitioners were registered Trade Unions and the 3rd to 8th

petitioners were members of these two Trade Unions. An objection was raised on the

locus standi of the 1st and 2nd petitioners to maintain the application. Court re-affirmed

the position expounded in Krishantha Kumara and Others (supra). I am mindful that in

this instance also the Court has at the end made a declaration that the fundamental rights

of the petitioners have been violated. However, the declaration made in favour of the 1st

and 2nd petitioners is inconsistent with the conclusion of Court on the preliminary

objection. The ratio of Engineering Diplomates Association and Others (supra) does not

in any way seek to disturb the principle established in Ceylon Electricity Board

Accountants’ Association (supra). Once again the principle was reaffirmed.

I am firmly of the view that the principle expounded in Ceylon Electricity Board

Accountants’ Association (supra) is correct upon an original intent interpretation.

In Budgetary Relief Allowance of Workers Bill [Decisions of the Supreme Court on

Parliamentary Bills (2016-2017) Vol. XIII page 31 at 32] Court held:

“It must be noted that the Constitution uses the word ‘citizen’ and ‘person’ in

several of its Articles. In Chapter III dealing with Fundamental Rights a ‘citizen’

has been guaranteed the Fundamental Rights set out in Articles 12 (2) and 14 (1)

whereas a ‘person’ has been guaranteed the Fundamental Rights in Articles 10,

11, 12 (1) and 13. This clearly shows that the legislature has used different words

with a specific distinction in mind.”

In my view, the word “person” in Article 126(2) of the Constitution must be given the same

meaning as “person” appearing in Articles 10, 11, 12(1), 12(3), 13 and 17. This is because

Article 17 read with 126(2) provides the remedy for any infringement of the fundamental

rights guaranteed in Articles 10, 11, 12(1), 12(3) and 13 of the Constitution.

The word “person” was not defined in the Constitution when enacted. It continues to be

the same. Nevertheless, Article 158 as enacted states that in that Article “person” includes

any body of persons or any authority. This provides cogent evidence of the intention of

the framers of the Constitution to provide an expansive definition to the word “person”

Page 22 of 25

in Article 158 whilst not doing so for the same word where it appears elsewhere. There

was no need for the definition of “person” in Article 158 to include any body of persons if

such body of persons came within the word “person” as used in other parts of the

Constitution.

Moreover, the word “citizen” in Article 14A and 121(1) has been defined to include, for

the purposes of those Articles, a body, whether incorporated or unincorporated, if not

less than three-fourths of the members of such body are citizens [See 19th Amendment to

the Constitution, 20th Amendment to the Constitution].

The amendment indicates that the legislative intent was to expand the meaning of the

term “citizen” in Articles 14A and 121(1) to include a body, whether incorporated or

unincorporated, if not less than three-fourths of the members of such body are citizens.

This brings a Trade Union within the term “citizen” for the purposes of Article 14A and

121(1).

Nevertheless, the legislature did not deem it fit to provide a similar expansive

interpretation to “person” in Article 17 read with Article 126(2) of the Constitution. In

Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Bill [Decisions of the Supreme Court on

Parliamentary Bills (1991-2003) Vol. VII page 389 at 394] it was held that the Constitution

has to be looked at as an organic whole and its terms cannot be fixed to meanings they

may have had at the time of the enactment. Even if I am to adopt this rule of constitutional

interpretation, the amendments referred to above will apply more forcefully in such

context in preventing the word “person” in Article 17 and 126(2) being interpreted to

include an unincorporated body.

The inclusion of freedom of association [Art. 14(1)(c)] and union formation [Art. 14(1)(d)]

as fundamental rights suggest a structural imperative to enable collective enforcement

thus validating a structural interpretation leading to interpreting “person” in Article

126(2) to include a registered Trade Union. In National Association for the Advancement

of Colored People v. Alabama [357 U.S. 449 (1958)] the United States Supreme Court

used structural First Amendment norms to protect organizational standing.

Page 23 of 25

However, structuralism cannot overlook other parts of the Constitution which impinges

on the interpretation arising for consideration. The original intent reflected in the

definition of “person” in Article 158 which has not been adopted in Article 126(2) negates

a structuralist interpretation over an original intent. The subsequent amendments of

Articles 14A and 121(1) referred to above puts the issue beyond any debate.

Mr. Pieris urged Court to be mindful of Article 4(d) of the Constitution which states that

the fundamental rights which are by the Constitution declared and recognised shall be

respected, secured and advanced by all the organs of government. A purposive

interpretation is what Mr. Pieris urges us to adopt. A purposive interpretation will require

an interpretation by intended remedial objectives and broad rights-protection aims. A

purposive reading of Article 126(2) would facilitate collective remedies, mirroring U.S.

citizen-suit statutes like the Endangered Species Act 1973, where courts construed “any

person” broadly to advance enforcement [See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997)].

I am not averse to adopting a purposive interpretation of the Constitution to advance

collective remedies. Court must always strive to exercise its just and equitable jurisdiction

in accordance with the constitutional directive enshrined in Article 4(d).

Nevertheless, Court cannot disregard the plain meaning in Article 126(2) of the

Constitution and give it an expanded meaning taking refuge behind Article 4(d). The

original intent as well as subsequent amendments made by the legislature clearly

indicates that “person” in Article 126(2) of the Constitution does not cover an

unincorporated body such as a registered Trade Union.

In Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants’ Association (supra. at page 12) Sripavan, C.J.

held:

“Where the scheme of the Constitution clearly shows that certain words or phrases

were deliberately omitted by the legislature for a particular purpose or motive, it is

not open to the Court to add those words either by conforming to the supposed

intention of the legislature or because the insertion suits the ideology of the Judges

deciding the case.”

Page 24 of 25

I must hasten to add that had the petition named one or more of the members of the

Petitioner society as a petitioner, the objection raised by the Respondents must be

dismissed by allowing such members to proceed with this application. [See Krishantha

Kumara and Others (supra), Engineering Diplomates Association and Others (supra)].

My attention has been drawn to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Lanka Viduli Podu

Sevaka Sangamaya v. Electricity Board [(2019) 2 Sri LR 91 at 102] where Court appears

to take the view that Section 2(s) of the Interpretation Ordinance may enable a Trade

Union to file a fundamental rights application.

Section 2(s) of the Interpretation Ordinance reads as follows:

“In this Ordinance and in every written law. whether made before or after the

commencement of this Ordinance, unless there be something repugnant in the

subject or context –

"person" includes any body of persons corporate or unincorporate;”

This interpretation has no application to Article 126(2) for two reasons.

Firstly, the Interpretation Ordinance has no application in the interpretation of

constitutional provisions. In S.C. Reference No. 01/2014, S.C.M. 10.11.2014 at page 13

Court in its Opinion held that the principles and assumptions involved in the interpretation

of a Constitution are different from those which apply when interpreting a statute or an

ordinary piece of legislation. In this regard I must emphasize that Opinions and

Determinations of the Supreme Court have the same status as that of its judgments [See

Bandaranaike v. Attorney-General (1982) 2 Sri LR 786 at 792]. Sharvananda

[Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka, Arnold’s International Printing House, 1993, page 43]

states that the Interpretation Ordinance does not apply to the interpretation of the

provisions of the Constitution, as the Constitution was enacted in the exercise of

Constitutional power and not in the exercise of the legislative power of Parliament [See

also Sri Lanka Telecommunications Bill (Decisions of the Supreme Court on

Parliamentary Bills (1991-2003) Vol. VII page 23].

Page 25 of 25

Secondly, Although Sharvananda (ibid. pages 43-44) states that Section 2 of the

Interpretation Ordinance may legitimately be referred to appreciate the concept of

“person”, Section 2 has no application in the context of Article 126(2) of the Constitution

for the reasons expounded above.

In summary, the original intent rule of interpretation clearly shows that the framers of the

Constitution intended the word “person” in Article 126(2) of the Constitution to have a

narrow textualist meaning. It did not include unincorporated bodies such as a registered

Trade Union. Article 158 makes this quite clear. The subsequent amendments made to

Articles 14A and 121(1) reflects that this original intent was maintained although the word

“citizen” was given an expanded meaning to include a body, whether incorporated or

unincorporated.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioner does not have locus standi to

maintain this application. The preliminary objection is upheld.

The application is dismissed without costs.
