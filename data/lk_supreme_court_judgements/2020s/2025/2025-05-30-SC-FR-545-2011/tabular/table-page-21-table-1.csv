"This  position  was  revisited 
in  Engineering  Diplomates  Association  and  Others  v."
"Abeygunasekara  and  Others  [S.C.F.R.  Application  No.  531/2011,  S.C.M.  20.07.2023]"
"where  the  1st  and  2nd  petitioners  were  registered  Trade  Unions  and  the  3rd  to  8th"
"petitioners were  members of these two Trade Unions. An objection was raised on  the"
"locus standi of the 1st and 2nd petitioners to maintain the application. Court re-affirmed"
"the position expounded in Krishantha Kumara and Others (supra). I am mindful that in"
"this instance also the Court has at the end made a declaration that the fundamental rights"
"of the petitioners have been violated. However, the declaration made in favour of the 1st"
"and  2nd  petitioners 
is 
inconsistent  with  the  conclusion  of  Court  on  the  preliminary"
"objection. The ratio of Engineering Diplomates Association and Others (supra) does not"
"in  any  way  seek 
to  disturb 
the  principle  established 
in  Ceylon  Electricity  Board"
"Accountants’ Association (supra). Once again the principle was reaffirmed."
"I  am  firmly  of  the  view  that  the  principle  expounded 
in  Ceylon  Electricity  Board"
"Accountants’ Association (supra) is correct upon an original intent interpretation."
"In  Budgetary  Relief  Allowance  of  Workers  Bill  [Decisions  of  the  Supreme  Court  on"
"Parliamentary Bills (2016-2017) Vol. XIII page 31 at 32] Court held:"
"“It  must  be  noted  that  the  Constitution  uses  the  word  ‘citizen’  and  ‘person’  in"
"several of its Articles. In Chapter III dealing with Fundamental Rights a ‘citizen’"
"has been guaranteed the Fundamental Rights set out in Articles 12 (2) and 14 (1)"
"whereas a ‘person’ has been guaranteed the Fundamental Rights in Articles 10,"
"11, 12 (1) and 13. This clearly shows that the legislature has used different words"
"with a specific distinction in mind.”"
"In my view, the word “person” in Article 126(2) of the Constitution must be given the same"
"meaning as “person” appearing in Articles 10, 11, 12(1), 12(3), 13 and 17. This is because"
"Article 17 read with 126(2) provides the remedy for any infringement of the fundamental"
"rights guaranteed in Articles 10, 11, 12(1), 12(3) and 13 of the Constitution."
"The word “person” was not defined in the Constitution when enacted. It continues to be"
"the same. Nevertheless, Article 158 as enacted states that in that Article “person” includes"
"any body of persons or any authority. This provides cogent evidence of the intention of"
"the framers of the Constitution to provide an expansive definition to the word “person”"
