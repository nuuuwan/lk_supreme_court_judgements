"However, structuralism cannot overlook other parts of the Constitution which impinges"
"on  the 
interpretation  arising  for  consideration.  The  original 
intent  reflected 
in  the"
"definition of “person” in Article 158 which has not been adopted in Article 126(2) negates"
"a  structuralist  interpretation  over  an  original  intent.  The  subsequent  amendments  of"
"Articles 14A and 121(1) referred to above puts the issue beyond any debate."
"Mr. Pieris urged Court to be mindful of Article 4(d) of the Constitution which states that"
"the fundamental rights which are by the Constitution declared and recognised shall be"
"respected,  secured  and  advanced  by  all 
the  organs  of  government.  A  purposive"
"interpretation is what Mr. Pieris urges us to adopt. A purposive interpretation will require"
"an  interpretation  by  intended  remedial  objectives  and  broad  rights-protection  aims.  A"
"purposive  reading  of  Article  126(2)  would  facilitate  collective  remedies,  mirroring  U.S."
"citizen-suit statutes like the Endangered Species Act 1973, where courts construed “any"
"person” broadly to advance enforcement [See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154 (1997)]."
"I am not averse to adopting a purposive  interpretation of the Constitution to advance"
"collective remedies. Court must always strive to exercise its just and equitable jurisdiction"
"in accordance with the constitutional directive enshrined in Article 4(d)."
"Nevertheless,  Court  cannot  disregard 
the  plain  meaning 
in  Article  126(2)  of 
the"
"Constitution  and  give  it  an  expanded  meaning  taking  refuge  behind  Article  4(d).  The"
"original 
intent  as  well  as  subsequent  amendments  made  by  the 
legislature  clearly"
"indicates 
that  “person” 
in  Article  126(2)  of 
the  Constitution  does  not  cover  an"
"unincorporated body such as a registered Trade Union."
