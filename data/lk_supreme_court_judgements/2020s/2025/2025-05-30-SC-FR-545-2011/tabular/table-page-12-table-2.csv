"Although the petitioner in that application was the wife of the detainee, the petition was"
"accompanied by an affidavit of the detainee."
"Amarasinghe, J. (with T.D. Bandaranayake, J. agreeing) held (at page 124):"
"““How  should  the  words  of  this  provision  of  the  Constitution  be  construed?  It"
"should be construed according to the intent of the makers of the Constitution."
"Where,  as 
in  the  Article  before  us,  the  words  are 
in  themselves  precise  and"
"unambiguous and there is no absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency with the rest"
"of the Constitution, the words themselves do best declare that intention. No more"
"can  be  necessary  than  to  expound  those  words  in  their  plain,  natural,  ordinary,"
"grammatical and literal sense.” (emphasis added)"
"Amarasinghe, J. went on to hold (ibid.) that:"
"“…  Article  126  (2)  confers  a  recognized  position  only  upon  the  person  whose"
"fundamental rights are alleged to have been violated and upon an attorney-at-"
"law acting on behalf of such a person. No other person has a right to apply to the"
"Supreme  Court  for  relief  or  redress 
in  respect  of  the  alleged 
infringement  of"
"fundamental rights.” (emphasis added)"
