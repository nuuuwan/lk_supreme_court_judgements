"However, one must bear in mind that the acceptance of public interest litigation is not an"
"acknowledgment of the right of any person to vindicate the fundamental rights of a third"
"party. On the contrary, it is an acknowledgment of the right of any person to institute a"
"fundamental rights application to vindicate a fundamental right he enjoys with the rest of"
"the community."
"Nevertheless,  the  present  application  is  not  framed  as  a  public  interest  litigation  and"
"indeed  cannot  be  so  characterized  anyway.  The  Petitioner  claims  that  due  to  the"
"impugned actions and inactions, the fundamental rights of the Petitioner Trade Union as"
"well as that of its members have been violated. None of the members of the Trade Union"
"have been included as Petitioners. I do not find any material to support the claim that the"
"fundamental  rights  of  the  Petitioner  have  been 
infringed. 
Its  claim  arises  from  the"
"allegation that the fundamental rights of its members, namely Development Coordinators"
"have been infringed."
"I must add in passing that the recognition by the Supreme Court of the availability of public"
"interest 
litigation 
to  espouse 
fundamental  rights 
is 
in  harmony  with  comparative"
"developments in India and England."
