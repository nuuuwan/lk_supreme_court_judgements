"126(2) of the Constitution to permit the lawful heirs and/or dependents of the deceased"
"to institute proceedings for the following reasons:"
"1.  Articles 11 and 13(4) by necessary implication recognize the right to life. Hence if a"
"person died by reason of torture or unlawful death (by the executive) the right of"
"any  person  to  complain  against  violation  of  a  fundamental  right  guaranteed  by"
"Article  17  read  with  Article  126(2)  should  not  be  interpreted  to  make  the  right"
"illusory. Article 126(2) should be interpreted broadly especially in view of Article"
"4(d) which requires the court to ""respect, secure and advance"" fundamental rights."
"2.  The deceased's fundamental rights under Articles 11, 13(2) and 17 were infringed"
"by the 2nd respondent and by the 1st respondent on the ground of culpable inaction"
"to  monitor  the  activities  of  his  subordinates.  The  deceased's  rights  accrued  or"
"devolved on the petitioner and their minor child. The deceased was put to death"
"""in  order  to  prevent  him  totally  and  permanently  from  complaining.""  On  that"
"ground also Article 126(2) should be interpreted expansively."
