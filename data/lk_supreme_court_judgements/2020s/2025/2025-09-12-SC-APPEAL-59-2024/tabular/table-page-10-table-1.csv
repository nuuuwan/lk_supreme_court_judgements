"Upon consideration of the material placed by the parties, the Court"
"of  Appeal  has  formed  the  view  that 
it  should  exercise 
its  powers  of"
"revision /restitutio in integrum in favour of the Defendant and proceeded to"
"set  aside  the  order  of  the  District  Court.  The  appellate  Court  considered"
"the  undisputed  fact  that  the  Defendant  was 
in  remand  custody  from"
"06.09.2023  to  20.09.2023.  It  also  considered  the  application  made  by  his"
"Attorney  to  the  District  Court  to  grant  “further  time”  of  two  weeks  to  file"
"petition and affidavit seeking to obtain leave of Court to appear and show"
"cause, 
in  terms  of  the  provisions  contained 
in  Section  12  of  the  Act."
"Thereupon, after referring to the statutory provisions of    Section 11(2) of"
"the  said  Act,  the  appellate  Court,  decided  that  it  “…  was  the  main  reason"
"which led to the learned Additional District Judge to refuse to grant time. Whereas"
"she  was  not  at  fault  on the  face  of  the  Section, under the  powers  of  revision  and"
"restitutio  in  integrum  this  Court  can  consider  whether  the  Legislature  intended"
"the  abrogation  of  the  Rules  of  Natural  Justice,  in  that  the  Rule  “Audi  Alteram"
