"rule  of  audi  alteram  partem  is  completely  incorrect  and  wrong  in  law  for",""
"following reasons:",""
"(1).","the  Court  of  Appeal 
incorrectly  applied 
the  principles  of"
"","natural 
justice  audi  alteram  partem,  which 
is  not  a  rule  of"
"","interpretation  and  also 
failed 
to  note 
that 
the 
statutory"
"","provisions  that  contain 
in  Section  11  and  16  were 
in  fact"
"","drafted in recognition of that principle,"
"(2).","the  Court  of  Appeal  erred  in  resorting  to  any  other  rule  of"
"","interpretation before proceeding to interpret the provisions of"
"","Section  11(2)  on 
literal 
rule,  being 
the  primary 
rule  of"
"","interpretation,  without  any  reason  as  to  why  the  plain  literal"
"","meaning of that Section cannot be applied,"
"(3)","the Court of Appeal incorrectly referred to principles outlined"
"","in  the  preamble  to  the  Constitution  to  establish  the  intention"
"","of  the  Legislature  and  it  failed  to  peruse  the  Hansard  for  the"
"","purpose  of  ascertaining  the  intention  of  the  Legislature,  in"
"","order to interpret the legislation,"
"(4)","the Court of Appeal erred when it held that “…  a proxy could"
"","be  sent  to  the  remand  prison  for  the  signature  …”  and  also  by"
"","adding “… it is not only a difficult thing but an almost impossible"
"","thing to obtain meaningful instructions while the Defendant was in"
"","remand  custody”  whereas  the  proxy  of  the  Defendant  itself"
"","confirms that it was signed in the presence of an Attorney-at-"
"","Law."
