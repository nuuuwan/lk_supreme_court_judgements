"S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024"
"these two determinations must be made by the original Court and not by"
"an appellate Court."
"Lastly,  I  wish  to  highlight  another  error  made  by  the  Court  of"
"Appeal  in  its  determination  to  interfere  with  the  order  of  the  District"
"Court. It is well settled since the pronouncement of Rustom v Hapangama"
"&  Co., 
(1979)  1  Sri  L.R.  352, 
that 
the 
insistence  on 
the  existence  of"
"exceptional  circumstances,  is  a  pre-requisite  that  warrants  the  exercise  of"
"the  discretion  conferred  on  the  Court  of  Appeal,  in  favour  of  a  petitioner"
"who  opted 
to 
invoke 
its 
jurisdiction  conferred  by  Article  138  of 
the"
"Constitution,  when  he  failed  to  seek  an  alternative  remedy  available  to"
"him."
"Section  16(1)  of  the  Act  states  that  no  appeal  shall  lie  against  the"
"decree nisi, which has been made absolute due to the failure of a defendant"
"to  make  an  application  in  terms  of  Section  15(a).  However,  the  Act  itself"
"offers an alternative remedy to a defendant who is aggrieved by an order"
"made under Section 12 of the Act. Section 16 confers power on the District"
"Court  to  entertain  an  application  by  a  defendant,  against  whom  a  decree"
"nisi has been made absolute, if such a defendant satisfies the original Court"
"of  either  of  the  grounds  that  has  been  specified  in  Section  16(1)(a)  and"
"16(1)(b), and he is therefore entitled to have that decree absolute set aside"
"subject to imposing security, provided that such an application was made"
"not later than one year from the date on which the decree  nisi  was made"
"absolute.  Therefore, the Defendant was required to satisfy the existence of"
