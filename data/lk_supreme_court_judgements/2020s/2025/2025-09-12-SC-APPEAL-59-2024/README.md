ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal by which the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (a

company duly incorporated in Sri Lanka and hereinafter referred to as

the Plaintiff Company) sought Special Leave to Appeal from this Court,

against a judgment pronounced by the Court of Appeal on 19.12.2023.The

Court of Appeal, by pronouncement of the said judgement, revised or

acted in restitutio in integrum, in respect of an order made by the District

Court on 14.09.2023 under Section 11(2) of the Recovery of Possession of

Premises Given on Lease Act No. 1 of 2023, (hereinafter referred to as the

Act). The original Court, by its order made the decree nisi which had

already been issued against the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Defendant) absolute, after refusing his

application to grant him further time to. show cause against the said

decree nisi.

After the said application was supported by the Plaintiff Company

on 17.05.2024 and, upon hearing the Defendant in opposing the same, this

Court decided to grant Special Leave to Appeal on the following question

of law:

Have the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal given an

incorrect interpretation to Section 11(2) of the Recovery of

Possession of Premises Given on Lease Act No. 1 of 2023?

In view of the request made by the Plaintiff Company to have this

matter taken up for hearing urgently, the appeal was taken up for hearing

on 27.06.2024. Parties were afforded an opportunity to supplement their

oral submissions that were presented before this Court, if they so wish, by

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

5

way of written submissions. The parties have availed themselves of this

opportunity and tendered comprehensive written submissions.

It would be pertinent to make a brief reference to the relevant factual

matters before proceeding to consider the submissions of the learned

Counsel for the Plaintiff Company for its acceptability in the determination

of the said question of law.

The parties have entered into an Agreement of Lease No. 23, attested

by T.S. Gunasekera, Notary Public on 23.07.2019, in relation to a premises

bearing assessment Nos. 18/1 and 18/2 of Sellamuttu Avenue, Kollupitiya

for a period of five years, commencing from 01.10.2019 and ending on

30.09.2024. The parties also agreed with a pre-determined quantum of

monthly rental, with a proportionate increment for each year of occupation

of the premises. The Defendant who came into possession of the premises

on 22.07.2019, thereafter fallen into arrears after the month of February

2020, in breach of the conditions that are stipulated in the said agreement.

On 08.08.2023, the Plaintiff Company instituted action against the

Defendant before the District Court of Colombo invoking its jurisdiction

under the said Act, seeking inter alia a judgment and decree to evict the

Defendant and his agents from the premises described in the schedule to

its Plaint, a judgment and decree to recover a sum of Rs. 11,795,506.00, as

arrears of lease rentals. The Plaintiff Company also sought the issuance of

an order nisi against the Defendant in the first instance, in terms of the said

Act.

That being the general background to the primary dispute that

erupted between the parties, I now set out the relevant factors that had

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

6

taken place in a more detailed manner since the said alleged breach and

would make an attempt to arrange them in a chronological sequence, as

they assume a greater importance in the task of determining the solitary

question of law presented before this Court.

After instituting an action in terms of the said Act, the Plaintiff

Company supported its application before the District Court of Colombo on

11.08.2023, seeking issuance of a decree nisi. The Court, by its order made

on the same day, issued the decree nisi against the Defendant. It further

ordered that the said decree nisi be served on the Defendant through the

Fiscal of that Court on a day specified in that decree, in addition it being

served under registered cover. The District Judge signed the decree nisi on

23.08.2023 and ordered that the decree be served on the two given

addresses of the Defendant, as disclosed by the Plaintiff Company in its

Plaint.

On 02.09.2023, the Defendant was arrested by Borella Police along

with several others, in relation to an allegation of committing certain

offences against a third party. He was produced before the Magistrates

Court of Colombo in Case No. B 98183/02/23 on the same day and was

remanded. In the meantime, the decree nisi issued against the Defendant

was affixed on the building situated at the Kollupitiya address by the Fiscal

of the District Court of Colombo on 07.09.2023. The decree nisi that was

served to the other address through the Fiscal of the District Court of

Nugegoda, was accepted by a representative of the Defendant on

08.09.2023.

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

The Defendant signed a Proxy on 13.09.2023 in the presence of his

Attorney-at- Law and thereby authorised the latter to represent him in the

instant action, instituted by the Plaintiff Company. On 14.09.2023, being

the date specified in the decree nisi as the date on which the Defendant

could make an application seeking leave of Court to appear before it and

to show cause, the said Attorney appeared in Court tendered the proxy

and, after informing Court that his client is in remand custody, moved

Court for two weeks time to tender a petition supported by an affidavit.

The reason indicated to the Court by the said Attorney was, that it was not

possible to obtain proper instructions (ksis Wmfoia) from his client, the

Defendant.

The Plaintiff Company strongly objected to that application, and

citing statutory provisions contained in Section 11(2) of the said Act, it

moved Court for an order for making the decree nisi, absolute. After

considering the submissions of Counsel, the District Court made order on

14.09.2023, refusing the Defendants application. The Court stated that in

terms of Section 11(2) of the Act, no provision was made by the Legislature

to grant any further time to file petition and affidavit. Accordingly, the

decree nisi was made absolute.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Defendant (who by then was

enlarged on bail by the Magistrates Court on 20.09.2023), had taken a

rather an unusual step. He decided to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court

of Appeal, conferred under Article 138 of the Constitution, by filing an

application for revision and/or restitutio in integrum against the said order

of the District Court on 01.10.2023. The primary relief prayed for by the

Defendant in that application was the intervention of the appellate Court

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

8

by setting aside the said order. He also sought the dismissal of the Plaint of

the Plaintiff Company.

In that application for revision and/or restitutio in integrum, the

Defendant had highlighted several exceptional grounds on which he has

prayed for the discretionary remedy. These exceptional grounds are listed

below in the order they were presented by the Defendant:

a. the trial Court failed to ascertain as to whether the Plaintiff

Company has no locus standi to institute an action against the

Defendant,

b. the trial Court failed to ascertain as to whether the amount of

money claimed by the Plaintiff Company is justly due,

c. the Decree nisi and the Order of Refusal were issued arbitrarily

and against the law by the trial Court,

d. Order of Refusal made by the trial Court violates Rules of

Natural Justice,

e. the trial Court failed to consider the reasons adduced by the

Defendant seeking permission to file his objections at a later

date,

f. the institution of the action by the Plaintiff Company is per se

erroneous since the relief sought in terms of prayer to the Plaint

is violative of the provisions contained in Section 6 of the said

Act.

The Plaintiff Company, in his Statement of Objections, stated inter

alia that since an alternative remedy available for the Defendant to seek

redress from the impugned order, he cannot invoke jurisdiction conferred

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

9

under Article 138, being it is an extraordinary jurisdiction. In addition, the

Plaintiff Company challenged the factual assertion of the Defendant by

stating that filing of the proxy through an Attorney-at-Law is ex facie proof

that he (the Defendant) was in a position to give instructions to his

Attorney and therefore moved the appellate Court to dismiss the said

application for revision/ restitutio in integrum.

The contentions that were advanced by the Defendant in support of

his application before the Court of Appeal are as follows:

a. in the absence of a board resolution of the Plaintiff Company the

institution of an action is bad in law,

b. in the absence of a resolution empowering E Lin, a director of the

Plaintiff Company, to execute the said Lease Agreement, it had

not been properly executed,

c. the affidavit by one of the directors of the Plaintiff Company

along with the Plaint cannot be taken into consideration

according to law,

d. the Plaintiff Company failed to prove that the premises given on

lease is lawfully due to the Plaintiff Company in terms of Section

4(1)(a) of the said Act,

e. the Plaintiff Company failed to disclose a proper cause of action

and comply with Section 46(2)(d) of the Civil Procedure Code as

required in terms of Section 4(1) of the said Act,

f. the Plaintiff Company failed to properly plead its cause and thus

failed to comply with Section 40(d) of the Civil Procedure Code

and as such there was total want of jurisdiction,

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

10

g. the Order of Refusal is arbitrary and against the law as it violates

the Rules of Natural Justice.

Upon consideration of the material placed by the parties, the Court

of Appeal has formed the view that it should exercise its powers of

revision /restitutio in integrum in favour of the Defendant and proceeded to

set aside the order of the District Court. The appellate Court considered

the undisputed fact that the Defendant was in remand custody from

06.09.2023 to 20.09.2023. It also considered the application made by his

Attorney to the District Court to grant further time of two weeks to file

petition and affidavit seeking to obtain leave of Court to appear and show

cause, in terms of the provisions contained in Section 12 of the Act.

Thereupon, after referring to the statutory provisions of Section 11(2) of

the said Act, the appellate Court, decided that it was the main reason

which led to the learned Additional District Judge to refuse to grant time. Whereas

she was not at fault on the face of the Section, under the powers of revision and

restitutio in integrum this Court can consider whether the Legislature intended

the abrogation of the Rules of Natural Justice, in that the Rule Audi Alteram

Partem in enacting the above provision.

In view of the fact that the Act did not specifically abrogate the

principles of natural justice, that Court proceeded to hold that a

legislation would not be interpreted to shut out a party from legal proceedings

pending against him when he has a valid and reasonable reason to move for

further time.

During the hearing of the instant appeal, learned Counsel for the

Plaintiff Company contended that the process of reasoning, adopted by the

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

11

Court of Appeal and the interpretation given to Section 11(2) of the Act on

rule of audi alteram partem is completely incorrect and wrong in law for

following reasons:

(1). the Court of Appeal incorrectly applied the principles of

natural justice audi alteram partem, which is not a rule of

interpretation and also failed to note that the statutory

provisions that contain in Section 11 and 16 were in fact

drafted in recognition of that principle,

(2). the Court of Appeal erred in resorting to any other rule of

interpretation before proceeding to interpret the provisions of

Section 11(2) on literal rule, being the primary rule of

interpretation, without any reason as to why the plain literal

meaning of that Section cannot be applied,

(3) the Court of Appeal incorrectly referred to principles outlined

in the preamble to the Constitution to establish the intention

of the Legislature and it failed to peruse the Hansard for the

purpose of ascertaining the intention of the Legislature, in

order to interpret the legislation,

(4) the Court of Appeal erred when it held that a proxy could

be sent to the remand prison for the signature and also by

adding it is not only a difficult thing but an almost impossible

thing to obtain meaningful instructions while the Defendant was in

remand custody whereas the proxy of the Defendant itself

confirms that it was signed in the presence of an Attorney-at-

Law.

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

12

What lies at the very core of the contention is the statutory

provisions contained in Section 11(2), which reads as follows:

The Court shall not grant the defendant any further time to make

an application to enable the defendant to seek leave to appear and

show cause against such decree nisi.

It is this particular Section that the Court of Appeal has found

to be in violation of the rule Audi Alteram Partem, and therefore held that

under the powers of revision and restitutio in integrum this Court can

consider whether the Legislature intended the abrogation of the Rules of Natural

Justice, in that the Rule Audi Alteram Partem in enacting the above provision.

Thus, the Court of Appeal has undertaken an investigation whether the

Legislature, in enacting Section 11(2) of the Act, has intended the

abrogation of the Rules of Natural Justice, in that the Rule Audi Alteram Partem

.

After inserting a number of quotations from judicial precedents in

its impugned judgment which defined its revisionary jurisdiction, the

Court of Appeal has thereupon arrived at its final conclusion, that [O]n

the basis of audi alteram partem referred to and explained above, this Court sets

aside the order of the learned Additional District Judge dated 14.09.2023 and set

aside the decree absolute, exercising the powers of revision and restitutio in

integrum and allows the defendant petitioner to file papers in terms of Section

12(2) of the Act within 06 weeks from the date of this judgment , subject to the

depositing in the District Court of a sum of Rs.11,975,506.00 either in cash or

upon a bank guarantee or an acceptable security.

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

13

It appears that, in the assessment of the Court of Appeal, the only

exceptional ground that merited its intervention with the impugned order

of the original Court is the ground urged by the Defendant that the Order

of Refusal made by the lower Court is arbitrary and against the law, as it

violates the Rules of Natural Justice. In doing so, the Court of Appeal

concluded that Section 11 (2) is explicit in laying down the applicable law

in this regard and therefore, the trial Court could not be faulted for making

such an order. Hence, the decision of the Court of Appeal to intervene

with the legally valid order was made not because an error of law

committed by the District Court, but because the Act and the provisions of

Section 11(2) do not specifically abrogate the principles of natural justice,

and therefore a legislation would not be interpreted to shut out a party from

legal proceedings pending against him when he has a valid and reasonable reason

to move for further time.

The Court of Appeal reached the said conclusion purely on the

premise that the statutory provisions contained in the Act did not abrogate

the applicability of the Rules of Natural Justice and therefore it had the

power under Article 138 to remedy an injustice that resulted in due to

strict adherence by the District Court to the statutory provisions contained

in Section 12(1), which it taken to be contrary to the rule, audi alteram

partem.

With due respect to the appellate Court, it is my considered view

that it proceeded to act on that premise upon after undertaking evaluation

of the statutory provisions contained in the Act, particularly of Section

12(1) and reaching a totally erroneous conclusion.

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

14

Let me set out the many reasons for my view in a more detailed

manner.

It is critical to bear in mind an important principle of interpretation

of Statutes in this regard, because it spells out the boundaries within which

a Court could undertake such an exercise. At page 1 of his work, on

Interpretation of Statutes, Maxwell quoted the judgment of Lord Greene

MR in Re A Debtor [1948] 2 All E.R. 533 (at p. 536) that [I]f there is one rule

of construction for statutes and other documents, it is that you must not simply

imply anything in them which is inconsistent with the words expressly used.

This rule is described as the literal rule and accepted as the primary rule of

interpretation of Statutes.

The text of Section 11(2) of the Act reads, [T]he Court shall not grant

the defendant any further time to make an application to enable the defendant to

seek leave to appear and show cause against such decree nisi, and as such it

effectively prevented a Court from granting any further time to a

defendant, who was already served with a decree nisi and directed to

obtain leave of Court to appear and show cause on a special date. What is

important to note in the imposition of this restriction, the Section 12(1)

only prohibits a defendant seeking any further time to make an

application (emphasis added).

It is clear from the word further contained in Section 12(1), that it is

an indication that the Legislature was alive to the fact that such a

defendant had already been granted time to do so by the District Court.

That Court did so by specifying the date which it thought as reasonable,

after allowing reasonable time period by enabling him to make an

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

15

application to seek leave of Court to appear and show cause against that

decree nisi, in terms of Section 12(1).

Therefore, the statutory prohibition imposed by Section 11(2) is an

important step in the procedure prescribed by the Act, applicable to a

defendant, when he seeks leave of that Court to appear and show cause

against the decree nisi. The Act specifies the procedure that should be

followed in the issuance of a decree nisi as well as to ensure its prompt

service on a defendant. Particularly, a defendant who was served with a

decree nisi issued under this Act, cannot present himself in Court at his

convenience. He is expected to follow the specific procedure set out in the

Act, by which he could appear before Court and, that too after obtaining

leave of Court, in order to show cause against the decree nisi. In order to

illustrate the point, I shall make a refence to the other Sections that set out

the procedural steps the District Court is expected to follow, in relation to

an action instituted before it under Section 3 of the Act.

After the plaint is filed and if it appears to the District Court that the

requirements of Section 5(1)(a) and (b) have been satisfied, it shall enter a

decree nisi. The decree nisi then should be served on the defendant within

a period not less than three days, in terms of the statutory provisions

contained in Part II of the Act. Section 11(1) imposes a duty on the issuing

Court to specify the date, in the decree nisi itself, on which the defendant

should appear before it and to make an application seeking leave of Court

to appear and to show cause, if he so wishes. Section 11(1) further requires

the District Court to specify the said date, after having due regard to the

distance from the defendants residence to Court. Section 8(1) imposes a

duty on a plaintiff to serve the decree nisi and thereby giving a

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

16

defendant a reasonable opportunity to make an application to seek leave to appear

and show cause. Thus, the Parliament, by enacting these specific statutory

provisions, had thereby ensured the availability of a reasonable

opportunity for a defendant, that enable him to appear before the Court

and effectively put up a challenge to the decree nisi that was served on

him. It is relevant to note here that the Defendant never made any claim

before the District Court either to the effect that he had not been served

with a decree nisi at all or had served but at a very late stage, depriving

him of any reasonable opportunity to show cause against the same.

Section 12(1) sets out the specific procedure by which such a

defendant should show cause against the decree nisi issued against him.

That Section, whilst recognising the defendants entitlement to show cause

against the already issued decree nisi against him, also imposes a pre-

condition him by stating that he first obtains leave to appear and show

cause from the Court which issued the decree nisi.

The Court of Appeal, in coming to a finding that Section 11(2)

prevented the Defendant from challenging the decree nisi, by refusing to

grant further time, has failed to consider the Act as a whole and the

statutory scheme that has been put in by Parliament. It has confined its

attention solely to that Section. Maxwell states (ibid, at p. 28) it is an

elementary rule that construction is to be made of all the parts together, and not of

one part only by itself. This principle was once more repeated by the

learned author (at p. 62) when he states the meaning of a section may be

determined, not so much by reference to other individual provisions of the statute,

as by the scheme of the Act regarded in general.

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

17

It is very evident from the approach of the Court of Appeal adopted

in dealing with the Defendants application under Article 138, it was

moved by the perception created in its mind of an injustice caused to him.

This was the main factual point urged before this Court by the learned

Counsel who represented the Defendant in this Court, when he submitted

that his client was unable to give meaningful instructions to his Attorney

due to his continued incarceration. He successfully convinced the Court of

Appeal of the validity of his submission on this point. Undoubtedly, it is

this very factor that influenced the Court of Appeal in granting relief as

prayed for by the Defendant. Whether the finding of fact reached by that

Court to the effect that the Defendant was unable to give such meaningful

instructions to his Attorney was correctly reached upon by the Court of

Appeal on the material placed before that Court is another factor that

requires consideration and shall be re-visited further down in this

judgment.

It is to remedy this injustice as perceived by the Court of Appeal,

that it had undertaken a long journey and traversed through the entire

scope of its jurisdiction conferred under Article 138, in order to arrive at a

finding that the Defendant was denied of an opportunity to present his

position which, in its view, was obnoxious to the rules of natural justice.

Therefore, the Court of Appeal proceeded to exercise its discretion by

setting aside the impugned order of the District Court made in terms of the

provisions contained in Section 11(2) of the Act, by adopting an

interpretation to that Section by stating that a legislation would not be

interpreted to shut out a party from legal proceedings pending against him when

he has a valid and reasonable reason to move for further time.

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

18

In view of this specific finding made by the Court of Appeal which

made it to provide an interpretation to Section 11(2) seeking to avert an

injustice that results in applying literal interpretation to that Section, it is

necessary to refer to the relevant rules of interpretation of Statutes that are

applicable in such a situation.

It is noted that among several issues on which this Court was

required to make determinations in the judgment of Stassen Exports Ltd.,

v Brooke Bond (Ceylon) Ltd., and another (1990) 2 Sri L.R. 63, there is one

that stands out from the rest, which has a direct relevance to the issue

under consideration in the instant appeal. In that, Court noted that it

was for this Court to provide an interpretation, whether the word rules in Article

182 (3) of the Code of Intellectual Property should, as the respondent suggests, be

given its wider, ordinary meaning, or whether, as the appellant says, it should be

given a narrower, technical meaning. Amerasinghe J, before arriving at a

determination of this particular issue has considered a significant number

of judicial precedents and quoted them extensively. Of these multitude of

quotations referred them, the principle of interpretation of Statutes, in

relation to instances where the meaning of a statutory provision is clear

and free from any ambiguity was highlighted.

Pollock, J in Miller v. Salomans (1852) 7 Ex. 475, (at p. 560) said: ... I

think, where the meaning of a statute is plain and clear, we have nothing to do

with its policy or impolicy, its justice or injustice, its being framed according to

our views of right or the contrary. If the meaning of the language used by the

legislature be plain and clear, we have nothing to do but to obey it - to administer

it as we find it; and I think, to take a different course is to abandon the office of

Judge, and to assume the province of legislation. A similar view was

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

19

expressed by Finnemore J, in Holmes v. Bradfield Rural District Council

(1949) 2 KBD 1, (at p. 7), by stating that: [O]f course the mere fact that the

results of applying a statute may be unjust or even absurd does not entitle a Court

to refuse to put it into operation.

In comparatively a recent pronouncement, Lord Diplock declared

that (vide judgment of Duport Steels Ltd and Others v. Sirs and Others

[1980] 1 All ER 529, at p. 541) if judges under the guise of interpretation,

provide their own preferred amendments to statutes which experience of their

operation has shown to have had consequences that members of the Court before

whom the matter comes consider to be injurious to the public interest.

Amerasinghe J, in encapsulating the essence of these multiple

pronouncements, held that (at p. 74) although in our Republic

sovereignty is, in terms of Article 3 of the Constitution, in the People, effect must

be given to the meaning intended by Parliament which, in terms of Article 4 (a) of

the Constitution exercises the power of the People, even though the Court (which

in terms of Article 4 (c) of the Constitution is an instrument through which the

judicial power of the People is exercised by Parliament) may believe that such a

meaning was opposed to the consciousness of the people.

This principle is also found in Maxwell (at p. 536) as [I]f language is

clear and explicit, the Court must give effect to it, for in that case the words of the

statute speak the intention of the Legislature. And in so doing it must bear in

mind that its function is jus decree, not jus dare: the words of a statute must not

be overruled by the judges, but reform of the law must be left in the hands of

Parliament. (emphasis added)

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

20

I am in respectful agreement with the pronouncement made by

Amerasinghe J, which was referred to above. Therefore, it is clear that when

the Court of Appeal determined that a legislation would not be interpreted

to shut out a party from legal proceedings pending against him when he has a

valid and reasonable reason to move for further time it has fallen into a serious

error, when it adopted an approach that had all the attributes of a post

enactment review of legislation, presented in the guise of providing a

remedy to an injustice caused by a statutory provision.

What remains now is to deal with the factual consideration, which I

kept aside earlier on in this judgment, namely that the acceptance by the

Court of Appeal that the Defendant has a valid and reasonable reason to

move for further time.

When the Defendant appeared before the District Court on

14.09.2023, through his Attorney, who had been appointed by way of a

valid proxy, and possessed the authority to represent him in Court, the

former was well aware of the fact that he had already been ordered to

appear before that Court on that specific day and make an application

seeking leave from Court to appear and show cause, if any, why this decree nisi

should not be made absolute. This is because, Section 11(1) states that the

date to be specified in the decree nisi as the date on which the defendant is to

make an application seeking leave to appear and show cause. These factors,

taken in conjunction with the prohibition imposed by Section 11(2) of the

Act with the words Court shall not grant the defendant any further time to

make an application to enable the defendant to seek leave to appear and show cause

against such decree nisi, results in a position that the Defendant, who failed

to utilise the opportunity provided by the Act to seek leave of the Court to

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

21

appear and show cause against the decree nisi, by operation of law is not

entitled at all to be granted any further time for that purpose.

The oral application of the Defendant seeking further time was

made to Court not on the premise that it was not possible to obtain any

instructions from him at all due to his incarceration, but because it was not

possible to obtain proper instructions. Although the Defendant was

detained in Fiscal custody, he was not held incommunicado or was under

a prohibition for an Attorney-at-Law to interview him after obtaining due

approval. The mere inconvenience for the Attorney to obtain proper

instructions from a client who was incarcerated, surely could not be

considered as a valid basis to put the process of litigation constituted

under the Act on hold. This contention is fundamentally flawed as what

guarantee the Defendant had that he would be enlarged on bail within the

next two weeks for his Attorney to obtain proper instructions.

Should the Defendant be entitled to succeed on this point, then the

action has to abated, awaiting the release of the Defendant. If after trial, he

was convicted and ordered to serve a term of imprisonment, then the

Court is compelled to await for his release after the completion of his term

as well.

The finality of the date specified in the decree to make an

application seeking leave of Court to appear is clearly evident, if one were

to examine the statutory provisions contained in Section 15(a) of the Act.

Section 15(a) states where a defendant, fails to make an application for

leave to appear and show cause on the date specified in the decree nisi under

subsection (1) of Section 11, the Court shall make the decree nisi absolute

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

22

(emphasis added). The literal meaning of this subsection is clear that, on

or before the date specified in the decree, only a Defendant could make an

application seeking to appear before the Court.

The question whether the Defendant utilised the reasonable time

interval provided by the Court in terms of the Act to make his application

should in the circumstances be answered in the negative. The District

Court could have granted the Defendants application for further time,

provided the Plaintiff Company consented, in terms of the proviso to

Section 15. However, in this instance, understandably the Plaintiff

Company strongly resisted granting of any further time to the Defendant

to make an application to leave of Court to appear. That objection left the

District Court with no discretion but to refuse the application of the

Defendant, as specifically stated by Section 11(2) of the Act.

The Court of Appeal, in its impugned judgment made another error

when it held that the Defendant should be allowed to file papers in

terms of Section 12(2) of the Act within 06 weeks from the date of this judgment,

subject to the depositing in the District Court of a sum of Rs. 11,795,506.00 either

in cash or upon a bank guarantee or an acceptable security.

In terms of Section 12(1), the Defendant is expected to obtain leave

of Court to appear before it as the first step and then only could show

cause against the decree nisi, as the second step. Since the Court of Appeal

ordered six weeks time to the Defendant to make that application ex mere

motu, it could be understood that the said part of the judgment of that

Court was meant to facilitate the request for further time. However, the

Court of Appeal also ordered the Defendant to make that application after

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

23

depositing in the District Court of a sum of Rs. 11,795,506.00 either in cash or

upon a bank guarantee or an acceptable security.

Section 12(3) states [U]on the filing of the petition and affidavit referred

to in subsection (2), if the Court is satisfied that the contents of the petition and

affidavit disclose a defence which is prima facie sustainable against the action of

the plaintiff for recovery of possession of the premises, the Court may grant the

defendant leave to appear and show cause against the decree nisi, subject to

security. Section 13 (a) to 13(c) in turn provides for the manner in

determining the quantum of the security that should be provided. Thus,

the question of making a deposit arises only if the application of the

Defendant satisfies the requirements as imposed by Section 12(3).

Since the provisions of Section 12(3) imposes a duty on Court to

satisfy itself of the contents of the petition and affidavit discloses a defence

which is prima facie sustainable against the action of the plaintiff . If it does,

then the Court should allow the Defendant to appear and show cause, of

course subject to the condition of depositing security in terms of that

Section. The District Court made no finding as to the disclosure of a prima

facie sustainable defence as the proceedings did not proceed to that point.

Therefore, when the Court of Appeal ordered the Defendant to deposit

security without first making a determination whether he should be

granted leave of Court to appear and show cause against the decree nisi

and without a determination whether he discloses a defence which is prima

facie sustainable against the action of the plaintiff, it had obviously acted

contrary to the provisions of the Act. It need not be emphasised here that

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

24

these two determinations must be made by the original Court and not by

an appellate Court.

Lastly, I wish to highlight another error made by the Court of

Appeal in its determination to interfere with the order of the District

Court. It is well settled since the pronouncement of Rustom v Hapangama

& Co., (1979) 1 Sri L.R. 352, that the insistence on the existence of

exceptional circumstances, is a pre-requisite that warrants the exercise of

the discretion conferred on the Court of Appeal, in favour of a petitioner

who opted to invoke its jurisdiction conferred by Article 138 of the

Constitution, when he failed to seek an alternative remedy available to

him.

Section 16(1) of the Act states that no appeal shall lie against the

decree nisi, which has been made absolute due to the failure of a defendant

to make an application in terms of Section 15(a). However, the Act itself

offers an alternative remedy to a defendant who is aggrieved by an order

made under Section 12 of the Act. Section 16 confers power on the District

Court to entertain an application by a defendant, against whom a decree

nisi has been made absolute, if such a defendant satisfies the original Court

of either of the grounds that has been specified in Section 16(1)(a) and

16(1)(b), and he is therefore entitled to have that decree absolute set aside

subject to imposing security, provided that such an application was made

not later than one year from the date on which the decree nisi was made

absolute. Therefore, the Defendant was required to satisfy the existence of

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

25

exceptional circumstances, if the Court of Appeal were to exercise its

powers of revision.

Despite the Defendant placed reliance on several exceptional

circumstances pleaded in his petition, the appellate Court considered

only one. The exceptional circumstance on which the Court of Appeal

acted in revising the order of the District Court was the deprivation of an

opportunity for the Defendant to show cause against the decree nisi. In the

process of reasoning adopted by that Court to arrive at the said finding, it

had failed to observe that the reason on which the Defendant could not be

granted any further time to show cause against the decree nisi was due to

operation of law. Since the impugned order made by the Court of Appeal,

being a legally valid order as held by the appellate Court itself, cannot be

considered as an error in fact or of any law committed by an original

Court which could be corrected in terms of jurisdiction conferred by

Article 138 on that Court. In any event, a situation that resulted in due to

operation of a statutory provision could not be taken as a one that has

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice

of a party in terms of the proviso to Article 138.

Thus, the question of law on which this appeal was heard, namely

[H]ave the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal given an incorrect

interpretation to Section 12(1) of the Recovery of Possession of Lease Premises Act

No. 01 of 2023? is accordingly answered in the affirmative.

S.C. Appeal No. 59/2024

26

The appeal of the Plaintiff Company is therefore entitled to succeed.

The impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal is accordingly set aside.

The order of the District Court is restored and affirmed.

The Plaintiff Company is entitled to the costs of this appeal.
