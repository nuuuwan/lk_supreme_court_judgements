On 27.03.1986, the first instance of disturbance as per Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents, they have made a complaint to the police whereby the hut has been removed by the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant. This police complaint is marked \u201cP 9\u201d 17. The next disturbance to their possession as per the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents was on 14.12.1995 where the Defendant \u2013 Appellant had forcefully attempted to divide the land. A complaint regarding the same was made to the Police whereby the attempt has been abandoned. This police complaint is marked \u201cP 10\u201d. 18. The document marked \u201cP 11\u201d is a further police complaint made by the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents to the Mirigama Police when the Defendants had attempted to fence a portion of the property on 27.01.1996. These complaints demonstrate that the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents have intended to possess the land as their own and have objected any disturbance by the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant in years 1986, 1995, and 1996 thereby asserting their possession. 19.

However, I am unable to find any material to conclude that there was any objection by way of complaints to Police by the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant to assert his ownership vis-\u00e0-vis this disturbance, which is an anomalous position for someone allegedly in possession, more so given the extent of damages allegedly suffered. 20. Further, the action bearing No 32505 instituted by the father of the Defendant \u2013 Appellant against one Namasekara for destroying rubber plantation in this land in 1989 too has not been pursued and thereby withdrawn by the father of the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant.

    "text": "21. Further, I note that the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant has submitted the following position to establish his possession in the land in suit. He takes up the stance that his predecessors had rubber plantations in this land. In this regard, the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant has submitted documents marked \u201cV3\u201d which is a document granting B. Daniel Fernando (grandfather of the Substituted Defendant - Appellant) to replant rubber in the land in suit (at page 436 of the brief), \u201cV4\u201d which also is a rubber replanting subsidy scheme for the year 1963 (at page 437 of the brief), \u201cV5\u201d and \u201cV6\u201d which are also in relation to rubber plantation in the land. I observe that all these documents are submitted subject to proof (see page 313 of the brief). While it is submitted by the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant that documents \u201cV3\u201d and \u201cV4\u201d are presumed to be proved as per S. 90 of the Evidence Ordinance, owing to the fact that all of the documents aforementioned are subject to proof, I find it difficult to accept the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant\u2019s position. 22. The Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant has further submitted that Deed No.148 dated 01.07.1964 was executed by Daniel Fernando transferring 1/4th of the land described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint, which they rely on as a further assertion of possession. In response to this, the Plaintiffs- Respondents state that Daniel Fernando did not have a beneficial interest in the land as the evidence of the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant in page 264 of the brief states that possession has not been handed over to them by the aforementioned Kadija Umma. Nonetheless, since the question at hand is prescriptive possession from the period of 1986 \u2013 1996, I am of the opinion that this position is complementary evidence at best and is therefore not capable of establishing the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant\u2019s possession on its own. 23. The Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant has also submitted document marked \u201cV9\u201d which states that the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant had rented out a house situated in the land in suit from March 1994 until August 1994, this document too, is submitted subject to proof. 24. Document \u201cV10\u201d submitted by the Substituted Defendant \u2013 Appellant which has been issued by the Regional Office for Rubber Development in Kegalle contains holding details in respect of rubber plantations in the land in suit.

    "text": "case at hand, 1986 \u2013 1996, this document only reflects a receipt of a certain amount as a subsidy for replanting of rubber for only 3 acres and 3 roods under Mr. B. Amaradasa, the Defendant \u2013 Appellant which this Court cannot take as conclusive evidence of possession. It must be noted that this area amounts to about a half of the extent of land claimed by the Defendant \u2013 Appellant as a joint owner in his answer to the Plaint as he has initially prayed to be declared a joint owner of the land described in the 3rd schedule to the plaint which amounts to 7 acres. 25. If this Court is to accept document marked \u201cV - 10\u201d as valid evidence, the required period of possession falling within the scope of the case at hand would shift and start from 1991 and end in 2001 which would be affected by the institution of action by the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents in 1996. Nonetheless, I am of the opinion that it is irrational to establish prescriptive title merely based on one proved document to the effect that he has received subsidies to replant rubber in the absence of any further affirmative action to assert such possession against outsiders, more so given the circumstances of this case where the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents have repeatedly asserted their possession. 26. Looking at cases decided by this Court on similar matters, I observe that the case facts of Carolis Appu v. Anagihamy [1949 51 NLR 355] are quite identical to the facts of the case at hand. In Carolis Appu v. Anagihamy (supra) even after the land of Carolis Appu was mortgaged and thereafter sold by the mortgagee to a third party, Carolis Appu has continued to possess the land up till action was instituted by the third party holding title to the land. The Court has held that although the third party has title by way of deed, Carolis Appu has established prescriptive rights to the land by way of continuous possession. 27. In these circumstances, I am of the opinion that the Plaintiffs- Respondents have held their possession in a way that is incompatible with that of another and have acted in order to assert such possession against any disturbance both during the period of possession by their mother K.L.M.J.S. Kadeeja Umma and after her death in 1985 until the institution of this action.",

In contrast, I observe that the position maintained by the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents to be quite consistent. One Don Susilawathi who occupies the neighboring land, giving evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents has stated that B. Daniel Fernando and Defendant \u2013 Appellant were not occupying the land in suit and that her brother, one Karunarathna Denipitiya was employed by the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents to take care of the land in suit and to work on the rubber plantations. I observe that this position is consistently reflected in the police complaint marked \u201cP 10\u201d and further affirmed through the evidence of Delanka Karunadasa (vide page 220 of the brief). Whereby I am inclined to accept the factual version of the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents. 32. In these circumstances, I observe that the affirmative action taken by the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents prove that they have held",

Therefore, the question of law in subparagraph (b) of paragraph 15 in the Petition dated 27.08.2018 is answered in the negative as this Court is satisfied that the Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents have adversely possessed the land in suit and have asserted such possession repeatedly in the face of any disturbances to the same. The judgment of the District Court dated 03.03.2011 and the High Court judgment dated 16.07.2018 are therefore upheld. 34. Appeal is dismissed, Plaintiffs \u2013 Respondents are entitled to costs.",
