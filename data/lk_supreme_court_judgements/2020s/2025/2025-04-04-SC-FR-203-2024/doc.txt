INQUIRY ON : 29th January, 2025

ORDER ON : 04th April, 2025

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J

When the Petitioners of these three Fundamental Rights Applications

supported their petitions seeking leave to proceed on 13.09.2024, this Court,

having considered the submissions of all Counsel, decided to grant Leave to

Proceed against the 1st to 25th Respondents in respect of the alleged

infringements of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the said Petitioners

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

SC FR 203/2024, 204/2024 & 205/2024

11

On that date, this Court granted several Interim Orders. The following

Interim Order was amongst them:

An Interim Order directing the 1st to 25th Respondents as well as the 27th to 28th

Respondents their servants, agents, successors or assigns or any other relevant

State functionary to take all steps to maintain the status quo ante that prevailed

as at 16-04-2024, which is the date of discontinuation of the previously prevailed

ETA system.

Thereafter, the Attorney-at-Law who represented the 1st Respondent-

Accused-Petitioner then, has filed the Motion dated 13.08.2024 followed by the

Motion dated 15.08.2024 to which the affidavit of the 1st Respondent-Accused-

Petitioner dated 14.08.2024 was found attached. These two Motions and the

affidavit revealed that the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner has admittedly

failed to give effect to the afore-stated Interim Order made by this Court on

13.09.2024. Thereafter, pursuant to an inquiry, Court decided to take

cognizance of the commission of a prima facie offence of contempt of Court,

alleged to have been committed against this Court or in disrespect of its

authority by the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner. Thereafter, the Court,

having directed the Petitioners to submit a draft rule in terms of Section 9(7)(a)

of the Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act No. 08 of 2024, also

directed the Registrar of Court to mention the case on 25.09.2024.

On 25.09.2024, Court served the Rule under the hand of the Registrar of

this Court on the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner. This Court, through its

Registrar, read over the said rule to the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner. On

the same day Court made an order under Section 9(7)(a) of the Contempt of a

Court, Tribunal or Institution Act No. 08 of 2024, detaining the 1st Respondent-

SC FR 203/2024, 204/2024 & 205/2024

12

Accused-Petitioner under fiscal custody until the conclusion of the inquiry

relating to the alleged offence of contempt of Court. In consequence to the said

Order of Court the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner has filed the instant

Petition dated 01.11.2024, praying for an order of Court releasing him on bail.

This Court inquired into the said application for bail on 29.01.2025 and

concluded the same. The Court heard Mr. Saliya Peiris PC, in support of the said

application as per the Petition dated 01.11.2024, and also heard the submissions

of the Petitioners, submissions of the learned ASG and the submissions of the

learned Counsel for the other parties. Since the 1st Respondent-Accused-

Petitioner filed similar petitions in SC FR No.204/2024 and SC FR No.205/2024

and sought identical reliefs as he did in the instant application, a consolidated

order is hereby pronounced in respect of SC FR No. 203/2024, which should

also be applicable to the other two applications, i.e., SC FR No.204/2024 and SC

FR No.205/2024.

The several grounds on which the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner seeks

an order releasing him on bail are set out from paragraph 18 to paragraph 28 of

his Petition dated 01.11.2024. They could be reproduced in summarised form to

read as follows:

His wife is a special education teacher who is currently working at a

reputed school;

His eldest daughter who is 25 years of age is currently in the United

Kingdom, reading for a Masters Degree and therefore he has to bear her

expenses;

His second daughter who is 22 years of age is currently pursuing a

Bachelor of Arts degree in fashion designing at the National Institute of

Business Management and therefore he has to bear her expenses.

SC FR 203/2024, 204/2024 & 205/2024

13

His youngest son who is 15 years of age also studies in a reputed school

who is due to sit for the GCE Ordinary Level examination.

His mother-in-law who is 79 years of age needs special care and

treatment due to her age and it is the Petitioner who takes care of her.

He has sold his personal vehicle for a sum of rupees, 7.3 Million in order

to provide the course fee and other expenses of his eldest daughter who

recently went abroad for higher studies.

We have carefully considered the set of circumstances urged by the

learned Presidents Counsel in support of the instant application for bail.

However, we are of the view that these grounds are common grounds that are

applicable to almost all the accused, if not for most, of those who are accused

of committing offences. Further, we are also of the view that these grounds are

of a very general in nature and vague.

In addition to the above grounds, the petitioner also has stated that he is

suffering from an asthmatic condition and therefore has been advised to use an

inhaler on a daily basis. Admittedly, the Petitioner has received treatment from

the Welikada Prison hospital as per paragraph 20 of his Petition dated 01.11.2024.

Since the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner has already received

treatment from Welikada Prison Hospital, we are not inclined to accept this as a

valid ground to release him on bail at this stage, particularly in view of the

Order this Court has made detaining him until the conclusion of the inquiry

into the contempt of the Court charge.

In paragraph 21, the Petitioner has relied on a diagnosis of certain

medical condition of his wife. However, this diagnosis is in respect of his wife

and not in respect of the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner.

SC FR 203/2024, 204/2024 & 205/2024

14

Although there are other grounds put forward by the 1st Respondent-

Accused-Petitioner in paragraph 21-23, we are unable to accept any one of those

grounds as serious conditions, which are in the circumstances of this case,

would warrant releasing the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner on bail.

In these proceedings Court has taken serious note of the alleged act of

wilful default by the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner to comply with the said

interim order made by this Court.

We have to take note of the fact that by the Order dated 25.09.2024, this

Court has made an order detaining the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner until

the conclusion of the inquiry. It appears to us that although the Court is ready

to commence and conclude the inquiry into the alleged contempt of court

charge, the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner is more concerned about

changing the direction of the case to that of an inquiry for bail rather than taking

interest and all steps to commence and conclude the inquiry into the contempt

of court charges. The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Respondent-

Accused-Petitioner informed this Court that the 1st Respondent-Accused-

Petitioner has already filed his show cause. Therefore, what remains is for this

Court to proceed with an inquiry. That could be done without delay.

The 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner is the Controller General of

Immigration and Emigration. The evidence against him in relation to the charge

of contempt of court is expected to come from the officials who are working

directly under him. It is not realistic to presume that the 1st Respondent-

Accused-Petitioner who is facing a serious charge, i.e. contempt of the apex

Court, would not do anything to escape from the said criminal responsibility

by employing whatever the tactics under his control to manipulate those

SC FR 203/2024, 204/2024 & 205/2024

15

witnesses, who are compelled to work under him, and thereby interfering with

the course of justice.

In view of the fact that the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner had failed

to comply with the aforementioned interim order issued by this Court, the

Petitioners of the Fundamental Rights Petition making submissions before this

Court on 13.09.2024 brought to the notice of Court that the 1st Respondent-

Accused-Petitioner had wilfully disobeyed the aforesaid interim order. It was

thereafter, acting on the submissions of the Petitioners of the Fundamental

Rights Petition who stated that the aforesaid alleged defiance on the part of the

1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner would lead to the collapse of the tourism

industry of the Country which is struggling to come out of a serious financial

crisis which prevailed in the recent past, that this Court has decided to examine

two officials who were present in Court under oath.

This course of action was adopted by this Court with a view to ascertain

the correct position in detail with regard to the alleged non-compliance of afore-

said interim order, before it proceeded to make its decision with regard to the

application of the Petitioners of the Fundamental Rights Petition to initiate

action against the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner for contempt of Court.

The said officials are, Herath Mudiyanselage Indika Kumara Herath (Controller IT,

Immigration and Emigration Department) and Hasantha Dodampegama

(Manager Special Business Solution & Sell, Special Project, Mobitel Pvt. Ltd.).

Moreover, we are also mindful that if his application seeking bail is

considered favourably, the probability of the 1st Respondent-Accused-

Petitioners continued participation in the inquiry relating to the charge of

contempt of Court pending against him, would greatly be reduced, given the

fact that he was functioning as the Controller General of Immigration. Thus, the

SC FR 203/2024, 204/2024 & 205/2024

16

flight risk that he poses in such circumstances is a realistic one and therefore

could not be ignored by this Court altogether.

By enlarging the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner on bail at this stage,

this Court would only facilitate the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner to take

control of the key witness whose evidence was recorded before this Court. One

such witness is the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioners immediate subordinate

officer, who functioned directly under his instructions. The facts of this case

being somewhat highly technical in nature, the Court cannot exclude the

possibility of such evidence being altered or tampered with by an interested

party. Such an exercise by a person with vested interest, can be facilitated only

with the blessing of the Head of the relevant Department.

Although the Petitioners who appeared in person informed Court that

they would leave the issue of granting of bail in the hands of the Court, we are

unable to purely act on that concession granted by them in view of the above

reasons.

In the above circumstances, we are convinced that there are sufficient

grounds for this Court not to release the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner on

bail before the conclusion of the inquiry. The Court has already made an Order

detaining the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner until the final determination

of the contempt of court inquiry. Hence, in view of the above reasoning, this

Court is not inclined to vary its order made on 25.09.2024. Furthermore, this

Court is of the view that it should desist from enlarging the 1st Respondent-

Accused-Petitioner on bail. Therefore, the Order made by this Court on

25.09.2024, must remain unaltered.

SC FR 203/2024, 204/2024 & 205/2024

17

Accordingly, the applications of the 1st Respondent-Accused-Petitioner

contained in his petition dated 01.11.2024, through which he sought to vary the

order made on 25.09.2024 and also for an order of Court releasing him on bail

pending inquiry of contempt of Court charge, are hereby refused.

The inquiry into the Contempt of Court Charges and the argument of

the main cases are already fixed for 08.05.2025. That date will stand.
