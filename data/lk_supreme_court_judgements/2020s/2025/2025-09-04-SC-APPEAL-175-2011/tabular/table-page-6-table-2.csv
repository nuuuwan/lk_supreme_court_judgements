"Hence, the current appeal has been lodged against the said judgment and leave"
"had been granted by this Court on the following questions of law,"
"1.  Did the Court of Appeal err in law, in failing to appreciate that in"
"terms of Section 17(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Arbitrator is"
"required to make ""such award as may appear to him just and"
"equitable"" and that the 4th Respondent-Respondent Arbitrator had"
"correctly held that the 5th Respondent-Petitioners' claim to a pension"
"was ""justified and consequently the award was within the jurisdiction"
"conferred upon the said Arbitrator""?"
"2.  Did the Court of Appeal misdirect itself in failing to consider that the"
"Arbitrator is required to make a ""just and equitable order"" and that"
"his jurisdiction is untrammeled by the Rules and Regulations of the"
"Pension Fund?"
"3.  Did the Court of Appeal fail to appreciate that the Management of the"
"Petitioner-Respondent Bank had acted unfairly by failing to place the"
"5th Respondent-Petitioner's claim before the Board of Directors which"
"had exercised its discretion in favour of the workman in the instances"
"cited by the Petitioner-Respondent Bank?"
"4.  Did the Court of Appeal misdirect itself in the application of Rule 5 of"
"the Rules and Regulations of the Pension Fund to the facts and"
"circumstances of the instant case?"
