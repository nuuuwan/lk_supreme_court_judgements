"The appellant, after not adhering to the decision of the bank regarding his"
"transfer, had submitted medical certificates to show that he was not in the best"
"of health and the bank had appointed a medical board and the board had"
"declared that he was fit to work."
"As he had not reported to work, the disciplinary inquiry had begun and he had"
"been cautioned by the committee."
"Therefore, the appellant does not fall in to the category who is fit to retire on"
"medical grounds or who had been found guilty upon a disciplinary inquiry."
"It is my opinion that the board of directors of the bank cannot use their"
"discretion in accepting the retirement of the appellant under rule 5 of the"
"scheme."
"Therefore, I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeal has not erred when it"
"has decided to quash the award of the arbitrator in view of the above-"
"mentioned facts. Hence, I answer the questions of law raised by the appellant"
"in the negative and dismiss the instant appeal and affirm the judgment of the"
"Court of Appeal."
