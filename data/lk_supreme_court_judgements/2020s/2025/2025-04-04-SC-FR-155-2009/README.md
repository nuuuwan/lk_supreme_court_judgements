THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The Petitioners, who were students of the University of Kelaniya (hereinafter the

University) at the time, invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court, alleging

violations of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 11 and 12(1) of the

Constitution. Leave to proceed was granted against all the Respondents on both Article

11 and Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

2. 1st to 3rd Respondents are members of the Sri Lanka Police and are some of the police

personnel who had arrived at the Kelaniya University premises on the 5th February 2009,

at the Vice Chancellors request and as directed by the Inspector General of Police.

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 37

FACTUAL MATRIX

3. The instant application relates to a state of turmoil involving violent clashes between two

rival student groups which left one student with stab injuries. As the application is heavily

dependent upon the volatility of this factual context, I have set out hereinbelow the

circumstances leading up to the application in better detail.

The Petitioners Narration of the Events

4. The Petitioners state that their second semester at the Kelaniya University commenced on

26th January 2009 and that some religious ceremonies including a Pirith Chanting

ceremony were held in the University during this period. It is as this Pirith Ceremony was

ongoing that the aforesaid clash between the two student groups had ensued.

5. The resulting tension within the University had culminated in yet another clash on or

about 5th February 2009 between student cohorts from the Art and Science faculties,

leading to absolute disorder within the University. In video recordings available before

the Court, students can be seen behaving in an absolutely unruly manner, pelting stones

at each other as well as the Police.

6. In the wake of this turmoil, a significant number of students who were not involved in the

violence had found themselves stranded within the University, particularly near the

University Library. The Petitioners state that police groups led by the 1st Respondent that

arrived to control this unrest suddenly started firing tear gas and rubber bullets

indiscriminately towards the University premises causing the students, including the

Petitioners, to be trapped inside the campus.

7. Amidst this chaos, two lecturers who happened to be present at the University premises

had requested the 2nd Respondent to facilitate the students so trapped to line up and

proceed towards the hostel and away from the unrest.

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 37

8. According to the Petitioners, as the students were heading towards their hostel, the police

team had erratically instigated a capricious assault on the students, apprehending a

number of them. The 1st Petitioner alleges that she was dragged by her locks on full

display to the public and manhandled into a police vehicle by a male officer whilst the 2nd

Petitioner, too, was apprehended and assaulted by a police officer after he walked up to

the police to mediate the sudden violence unleashed against the students. The lecturers

present had also been dragged by their collars and thrown into police vehicles by the

officers.

9. The Petitioners further assert that the incident was widely reported in television and

printed media causing intense humiliation and public shame to the Petitioners.

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd 4A and 5th Respondents Version of Events

10. The 1st Respondent, Senior Superintendent of Police of Kelaniya Division at the time

material, is now retired having reached the age of retirement.

11. The counter-narrative offered by the 1st Respondent, explained that he visited the

University of Kelaniya on 5th February 2009 as directed by the Inspector General of Police

pursuant to a request from the Vice Chancellor of the University of Kelaniya to

recommence an abruptly concluded meeting relating to the stabbing incident at the

University.

12. In the aftermath of the aforementioned stabbing incident, which took place on or about

3rd February 2009, the police had stationed officers within the University to prevent further

sporadic clashes among the students as there had been various altercations and breaches

of peace following the stabbing. According to the Respondents, the University had ceased

all academic activities during this period owing to the hostile conditions.

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 37

13. There had been occasional gatherings of students as well as large quantities of stones of

various sizes found scattered around the University premises and on the road running

through the University. As a precautionary measure, as specifically requested by the Vice

Chancellor, riot squads of neighbouring police stations had been summoned to keep

peace around the University and stay on top of any unforeseen incidents that may ensue.

14. On 5th February 2009, while the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents were at the meeting with the

Vice Chancellor, they had observed an assembly of students of the Arts faculty and the

Science faculty attempting to break through the gates to enter the Vice Chancellors

compound. They had subsequently received information of students throwing sand-filled

bottles and stones at the police officers who were on duty on the University premises and

on the public road, causing injuries to several of the officers.

15. Owing to the unrest within the University premises and the blockage of the public road

that runs through the University, the police had taken immediate steps to disperse the

studentsstarting with verbal warnings in all three languages. Thereafter, the failure of

the student gathering to heed such warnings had led to the firing of tear gas to disperse

the crowd.

16. Officers had proceeded to arrest about 13 students, both male and female, on the

grounds of, inter alia, instigating or physically participating in riots, unlawful assembly,

engaging in assault, causing mischief as well as attempting to take the Vice Chancellor

hostage. The arrestees had then been produced before the Magistrate of Colombo under

the due procedure established by law. The 1st and 2nd Petitioners were also among the

students so produced.1

1 As evidenced by Magistrates Court Record B/2711/05 marked P6

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 37

17. The Respondents further submit that all the police officers on duty, including those who

had been summoned to restore peace within the University premises, acted bona fide in

their official capacity to ensure the safety of persons, restore peace, minimise damages to

the students as well as to the public and state property, with no malicious intention or

ulterior motives towards any student, including the Petitioners.

ANALYSIS

Article 11 of the Constitution and Its Ambit

18. Article 11 of the Constitution states in the most absolute and unambiguous terms that,

No person shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or

treatment.

19. Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7 of the International

Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as Article 3 of the European Convention on

Human Rights (which happens to not contain the word cruel) all espouses the prohibition

against torture in near identical terms.2

20. Article 1(1) of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or

Degrading Treatment or Punishment (hereinafter Convention Against Torture), defines

torture in the following manner:

For the purposes of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which

severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on

a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a

confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is

suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or

for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is

2 See also Ratnapala v. Dharmasiri [1993] 1 Sri L.R. 224, at p. 234 (Kulatunga, J)

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 37

inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public

official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or

suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.3

21. The Section 12 of the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading

Treatment or Punishment Act, No. 22 of 1994 (hereinafter Torture Act) defines torture as

follows;

"torture" with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means any act

which causes severe pain, whether physical or mental, to any other person,

being an act which is

(a) done for any of the following purposes that is to say

(i) obtaining from such other person or a third person, any

information or confession; or

(ii) punishing such other person for any act which he or a third

person has committee [sic], or is suspected of having committed;

or

(iii) intimidating or coercing such other person or a third person; or

(b) done for any reason based on discrimination,

and being in every case, an act which is done by, or at the initiation of, or with the

consent or acquiescence of, a public officer or other person acting in an official

capacity.4

22. It is well understood that Article 11 contains an entrenched right that is absolute and non-

derogableone that is available to all, from the best of men to the worst, and one that

cannot be abridged even in times of war or absolute emergency.

3 Emphasis added

4 Emphasis added

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 37

23. As this Court held in Amal Sudath Silva v. Kodituwakku, Inspector of Police and

Others,5

It prohibits every person from inflicting torturesome, cruel or inhuman treatment

on another. It is an absolute fundamental right subject to no restrictions or limitations

whatsoever. Every person in this country, be he a criminal or not, is entitled to this

right to the fullest content of its guarantee

24. As Priyantha Fernando, J observed more recently in Wasana Niroshini Wickrama v.

Nalaka and Others,6

it is evident that the protection provided under Article 11 of the Constitution,

unlike other fundamental safeguards, provides for absolute protection to an

individual. It is recognized as an absolute right, which guarantees absolute

protection. This means that, the freedom from torture cannot be tampered with,

limited, or restricted under any circumstances. As it is observed in the case of Amal

Silva(supra) the Courts of Sri Lanka have acted as guardians to ensure that this right

is protected to its fullest measure.

25. It is well understood that no restriction on Article 11 can be found in the Constitution

itself or any other law. The absolute and non-derogable nature of the right is also

apparent in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading

Treatment or Punishment as well as the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel,

Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act, No. 22 of 1994.

26. Article 2(2) of the Convention Against Torture provides that [n]o exceptional circumstances

whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any

5 [1987] 2 Sri L.R. 119, at p. 126

6 SC FR 349/2014, SC Minutes of 16th October 2023 [29] (Emphasis omitted)

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 37

other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture, whereas Section 3 of

the Torture Act provides the fact that any act constituting an offence under this Act was

committed(a) at a time when there was a state of war, threat of war, internal political

instability or any public emergency; (b) on an order of a superior officer or a public

authority to not be tenable defences to any offence under the Act.

27. As this right is so clearly unqualified, there can be no defence, justification or excusable

rationale for torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

28. In applications of this nature, this Court is then left with a direct yet difficult question:

Whether a person has been subject to such treatment that may constitute torture,

inhuman or degrading treatment under the unique circumstances of each such

application.

29. The instant case leaves no doubt that the 1st Petitioner was apprehended by grabbing her

hair and that she was manhandled in to the police vehicle as she was arrested. These facts

are amply clear from the audio-visual recordings available before the Court. However,

insofar as the factual backdrop of this application is concerned, what those recordings

further make clear is that the Petitioners narratives do not reveal the full picture. This, I

shall examine in greater detail later in the judgment.

The Prohibition of Torture: A Matter of Dignity

30. The conduct complained of in the case at hand, as I have already noted, is one that

involves an element of physical force. However, the Petitioners grievances, especially that

of the 1st Petitioner, were hardly limited to the physical force used or any physical pain

thereby caused. In addition to the corporeal pain and suffering alleged, her submissions

also related to her dignity, as she claims to be aggrieved by how her image and reputation

came to be scathed from the treatment she endured for the world to see.

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 37

31. In H.M. Punchimenike and Another v. D. M. Bandula Saman Dissanayake and

Others,7 Obeyesekere, J began His Lordships analysis of Article 11 with the following

reminder with reference to the Svasti to our Constitution:

It is clear that human dignity underpins the application of all fundamental rights,

and is the fundamental virtue sought to be protected through the securement of

fundamental rights and the Rule of Law, as demonstrated by the Svasti to our

Constitution.

32. I see this proposition as undeniable insofar as the prohibition of torture is concerned, for

it is a right entrenched in one of the most rudimentary aspects of human characterthe

natural aversion to pain, whatever form it may come in. As the European Court of Human

Rights (ECtHR) observed in Bouyid v. Belgium,8 the prohibition of torture and inhuman

or degrading treatment or punishment is a value of civilisation closely bound up with respect

for human dignity.9

33. For much of human history, the device of torture was considered a useful tool for various

ends by those unconcerned with righteousness. The term righteousness may well sound

anomalous here, as torture was even regarded a tool of justice for a significant portion of

history, both as a mode of trial and a form of punishment.10 The notion of Judgment of

God, which manifested in various forms of trial by ordeal, was such a barbarous form of

inquiry prevalent in most parts of the world and can be seen as a precursor to the judicial

use of torture.11 Although torture, as a mode of extracting truth in judicial forums, survived

for more than twenty-five centuries among most civilisations, from the Greeks, Romans

to the British, among others,12 some observe the common law of England to have been

firmly against the use of torture from its very early days.13

34. In A (FC) and others (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department,14 Lord

Bingham for the House of Lords recounted how early English jurists sung praises of the

common law rejection of torture:

It is, I think, clear that from its very earliest days the common law of England set its

face firmly against the use of torture. Its rejection of this practice was indeed hailed

as a distinguishing feature of the common law, the subject of proud claims by English

jurists such as Sir John Fortescue (De Laudibus Legum Angliae, c. 1460-1470, ed S.B.

10 See generally A. Lawrence Lowell, The Judicial Use of Torture (1897) 11:4 Harvard Law Review 220. See also Danny Friedman, Torture and the Common Law (2006) Issue 2 E.H.R.LR. 180, at pp. 181-4

13 Cf. Friedman op. cit., at pp. 184-187 Friedman notes that torture was in fact used despite the common law prohibition in certain cases (See at 187-189); A (FC) and others (FC) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] UKHL 71 [12-13]

Chrimes, (1942), Chap 22, pp 47-53), Sir Thomas Smith (De Republica Anglorum, ed

L Alston, 1906, book 2, chap 24, pp 104-107), Sir Edward Coke (Institutes of the Laws

of England (1644), Part III, Chap 2, pp 34-36). Sir William Blackstone (Commentaries

on the Laws of England, (1769) vol IV, chap 25, pp 320-321), and Sir James Stephen

(A History of the Criminal Law of England, 1883, vol 1, p 222). That reliance was

placed on sources of doubtful validity, such as chapter 39 of Magna Carta 1215 and

Feltons Case as reported by Rushworth (Rushworths Collections, vol (i), p 638) (see

D. Jardine, A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England Previously

to the Commonwealth, 1837, pp 10-12, 60-62) did not weaken the strength of

received opinion. The English rejection of torture was also the subject of admiring

comment by foreign authorities such as Beccaria (An Essay on Crimes and

Punishments, 1764, Chap XVI) and Voltaire (Commentary on Beccarias Crimes and

Punishments, 1766, Chap XII). This rejection was contrasted with the practice

prevalent in the states of continental Europe who, seeking to discharge the strict

standards of proof required by the Roman-canon models they had adopted, came

routinely to rely on confessions procured by the infliction of torture: see A L Lowell,

The Judicial Use of Torture (1897) 11 Harvard L Rev 220-233, 290-300; J Langbein,

Torture and the Law of Proof: Europe and England in the Ancien Regime (1977); D.

Hope, Torture [2004] 53 ICLQ 807 at pp 810-811. In rejecting the use of torture,

whether applied to potential defendants or potential witnesses, the common law was

moved by the cruelty of the practice as applied to those not convicted of crime, by

the inherent unreliability of confessions or evidence so procured and by the belief

that it degraded all those who lent themselves to the practice.

35. Today, the prohibition against torture is a norm so well grounded that it is ubiquitous in

international as well as domestic legal systems, having become a peremptory norm in

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 37

customary international law.15 From the judicial use of torture to its absolute and non-

derogable prohibition, the morality of law in this aspect has evolved considerably. We

have now come to reject not only those abhorrent forms of corporeally torturous acts but

also the more subtle forms of mistreatment that wounds the human dignity.

36. As I see it, the judicial and academic emphasis on the sanctity of human dignity marks

one of the key steps in the evolutionary journey of our human rights jurisprudence. This

Court has more than once accepted the proposition that human dignity underpins the

right against torture as well as all other fundamental rights.16 It is also a notion that finds

support in a vast body of traditional knowledge, both religious and secular.

37. Commenting on the influence of Buddhism in governance, in his treatise An Invitation

to the Law,17 Justice Weeramantry observes the following:

The Buddhist concept of right conduct became integral to Buddhist governments

and legal systems (C2). Buddhism forbade the taking of life and many a Buddhist

monarch emptied the jails of convicted prisoners and refused to countenance capital

punishment

The highest embodiment of Buddhistic principles in law and government occurred in

India in the third century BC during the reign of Emperor Asoka, which has been

Sweden, Application No. 35950/20, 06th March 2025 (ECtHR First Section) [75] where the Strasbourg Court opined respect for human dignity and human freedom to be the very essence of the European Convention on Human Rights

17 C.G. Weeramantry, An Invitation to the Law (Stamford Lake 2015) at p. 23 (Endnotes omitted)

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 37

described by H G Wells as one of the brightest interludes in the troubled history of

mankind. His rock edicts (C4) ordered the affairs of the entire country on principles

of compassion towards all beings. Censors of piety were appointed expressly charged

with the duty of enforcing throughout the community what we would today call

human rights.

38. Dasavidha-rjadhamma or the Ten Royal Virtues in Buddhism espouses ten qualities any

righteous ruler must possess. Among them are the concepts of Dna (charity, generosity

or liberality), Sla (morality), Pariccga (altruism), Maddava (kindness and gentleness),

Akkodha (freedom from hatred, ill-will or enmity), Avihimsa (non-violence),

Khanti (forbearance, understanding and tolerance) and Avirodhana (non-obstruction or

non-opposition).18

39. As it is abundantly clear, these concepts require the rulers to have a high level of respect

towards the people and their dignity. Sla, or morality, specifically directs that he must

never destroy life or exploit others, whereas the Avihimsa requires not only that he harms

no one but also that he must prevent harm and all that involves violence or destruction

of life.19

40. Additionally, Buddhism also advocates that one must treat others with the same dignity

and respect he expects towards himself from others. This principle known as the

Aththupanayaka Dhamma Pariyaya is poetically indorsed in the revered Dhammapada as

follows:

Sabbe tasanti daassa/ ,

sabbesa jvita piya/ ,

18 ibid at pp. 247-8

19 ibid

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 37

attna upama katv/ ,

na haneyya na ghtaye/ .

[all fear the stick/punishment

all hold their lives dear

putting oneself in another's place

one must not commit violence nor kill]20

41. As I have adverted to, Buddhism, in its most profound and benevolent philosophy, insisted

that rulers respect not only the dignity of its human subjects but also the dignity of all

living beings.

42. In Hindu philosophy, justice and governance are deeply rooted in the principles of

Dharma (righteous duty) as reflected in ancient scriptures. Among the most profound

expositions of just and moral governance is found in the Ramayana, where Lord Rama is

depicted as the ideal ruler, embodying the highest ethical and leadership values. His reign,

often referred to as Rama Rajya, is regarded as a model of righteous governance, ensuring

justice, peace, and prosperity for all.

43. Like with Buddhism, the concept of Rajadharma (duty of a ruler) is central to governance

in Hindu thought. A righteous ruler, as outlined in the Ramayana, must embody key

virtues, including Nyaya (justice), Karuna (compassion), Satya (truthfulness), Kshama

(forgiveness), and Loka Sangraha (welfare of society). Governance, according to this

philosophy, is not merely about ruling but about fostering harmony, inclusivity, and social

equity.

20 Dhammapada, Ch X: Dhandavagga, Verse 130

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 37

44. Hinduism strongly advocates for non-violence (Ahimsa) as a guiding principle of

governance. The Mahabharata declares, "Ahimsa paramo dharmah"non-violence is the

highest religious duty. A ruler is expected not only to refrain from harming others but also

to actively prevent harm, ensuring that governance does not rely on cruelty, oppression,

or unnecessary conflict. Even in battle, he is to uphold honour, treating his enemies with

dignity, offering them paths to redemption.

Article 11: Different Thresholds and the Minimum Level of Severity Required

45. The existing jurisprudence of this Court makes it amply clear that both physical and

psychological acts can amount to torture.21 This position is stronger yet for pleas of cruel,

inhuman or degrading treatment for the threshold a petitioner is required to meet in

such a plea is lower by comparison to a plea of torture per se.

46. What constitutes torture and/or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is difficult to

define, and I do not think more precise definitions than those already available are

warranted. As Samarakoon, CJ held in Wickramanayake v. The State,22 the Article must

draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a

maturing nation.

21 See Mrs. W.M.K. De Silva v. Chairman, Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation [1989] 2 Sri L.R. 393, at pp. 403-4 (Amerasinghe, J); Adhikari v. Amarasinghe [2003] Sri L.R. 270, at p. 274; Channa Pieris and Others v. Attorney-General and Other (Ratawesi Peramuna Case)[1994] 1 Sri L.R. 1, at p. 107; Puwakketiyage Sajith Suranga v.

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 37

47. However, to come to a finding of Article 11 violation, as Amerasinghe, J observed in

Channa Pieris and Others v. Attorney-General and Other (Ratawesi Peramuna

Case),23

the acts or conducts complained of must be qualitatively of a kind that the

Court can take cognizance of. Where it is not so, the Court will not declare that

Article 11 has been violated

As to whether a particular act satisfies the relevant criteria is not an easy matter to

determine. The assessment is in the nature of things, relative and depends on

all the circumstances of the case including the nature and context of the act

and the manner and method of its commission. (Cf. the decision of the European

Court of Human Rights in the Tyrer case. [European Court of Human Rights Decision

of 25.04.1978] As it was observed in Gunasekera v. Kumara and Other (supra),

adopting dicta from Hobbs v. London & S.W. Railway [(1875) LR 10 QB 111, 121],

the decision whether an act is qualitatively of the kind that contravenes Article 11 is

something like having to draw a line between night and day; there is a great duration

of twilight when it is neither night nor day; but on the question now before the Court,

though you cannot draw the precise line you can say on which side of the line the

case is.

48. The case at hand, in my view, is one that falls on this twilight zone. While all forms of

violence and force against any person by the State must only be met with the strongest

reproach, different rights established under the fundamental rights chapter of our

Constitution require the meeting of different thresholds. For instance, to establish a

violation of Article 13(1), even the slightest use of force beyond that which is permitted

23 [1994] 1 Sri L.R. 1, at p. 105

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 37

under Section 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act may be sufficient. Where Article

11 is considered, that is far from the case.

49. Article 11 itself contains several thresholds. It prohibits torture, which is of the highest

severity, as well as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, which are at lower

thresholds of severity by comparison.24 Whether an act is torturous, cruel, inhuman or

degrading would most certainly depend on the facts and circumstances of each individual

case.25 As ECtHR expounded in Ireland v. The United Kingdom,26

In order to determine whether the techniques should also be qualified as torture,

the Court must have regard to the distinction, embodied in Article 3 (art. 3), between

this notion and that of inhuman or degrading treatment. In the Courts view, this

distinction derives principally from a difference in the intensity of the

suffering inflicted.

The Court considers in fact that, whilst there exists on the one hand violence which

is to be condemned both on moral grounds and also in most cases under the

domestic law of the Contracting States but which does not fall within Article 3 (art.

3) of the Convention, it appears on the other hand that it was the intention that the

Convention, with its distinction between "torture" and "inhuman or degrading

treatment", should by the first of these terms attach a special stigma to

deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering.

24 Wasana Niroshini Wickrama v. Nalaka and Others, SC FR 349/2014, SC Minutes of 16th October 2023 [19]

25 Janidhu Charuka Daham v. Sub Inspector Nelumdeniya, Police Station, Mount Lavinia and Others, SC (FR) Application No: 402/2015, SC Minutes of 21st May 2021, at p. 7

26 Application No. 5310/71, 18th January 1978 (ECtHR Plenary) [167] (Emphasis added)

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 37

Moreover, this seems to be the thinking lying behind Article 1 in fine of Resolution

3452 (XXX) adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 9 December

1975, which declares: "Torture constitutes an aggravated and deliberate form

of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment".

50. While the Strasbourg Court, too, has clearly recognised a distinction between torture,

inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment based on severity, it also

acknowledges the difficulty in grasping a threshold in such differentiation, taking a

considerably flexible approach which enables case-by-case decision making.27

51. In Gfgen v. Germany,28 the Strasbourg Court observed,

In order for ill-treatment to fall within the scope of Article 3 it must attain a minimum

level of severity. The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances

of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and,

in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United

Kingdom, 18 January 1978, 162, Series A no. 25, and Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no.

54810/00, 67, ECHR 2006-IX). Further factors include the purpose for which the

treatment was inflicted together with the intention or motivation behind it (compare,

inter alia, Aksoy v. Turkey, 18 December 1996, 64, Reports 1996-VI; Egmez v.

Cyprus, no. 30873/96, 78, ECHR 2000XII; and Krastanov v. Bulgaria, no. 50222/99,

53, 30 September 2004), as well as its context, such as an atmosphere of heightened

tension and emotions (compare, for instance, Selmouni, cited above, 104, and

Egmez, loc. cit.).

27 R.L. Hassanova, The Prohibition of Torture and its Implications in the European Legal Sphere (2023) 5:1 Central European Journal of Comparative Law 51, p. 62-63

28 Application No. 22978/05, 01st June 2010 (ECtHR GC) [88-89]

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 37

The Court has considered treatment to be inhuman because, inter alia, it

was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual

bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering (see Labita, cited above,

120, and Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, 118). Treatment has been held to be

degrading when it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear,

anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and

possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance, or when it was such as to

drive the victim to act against his will or conscience (see, inter alia, Keenan v.

the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, 110, ECHR 2001-III, and Jalloh, cited above,

68).29

52. Clearly, while a finding of inhuman and degrading treatment does not require the

establishment of a threshold of suffering so high as it does with a finding of torture; even

then, the maltreatment must result in a particular level of humiliation and debasement.

53. In X and Others v. Bulgaria,30 the ECtHR opined with reference to Article 3 of ECHR and

the requirement of the minimum level of severity the following:

Article 3 of the Convention enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic

society. It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or

punishment. Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall

within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of that level is, in the nature of

things, relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, principally

the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some

cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other

authorities, Nicolae Virgiliu Tnase v. Romania [GC], no. 41720/13, 116, 25 June

2019)31

54. As the ECtHR elucidated in Clipea and Grosu v. The Republic of Moldova,32 in

determining whether ill-treatment attains the required minimum level of severity,

the Court also takes other factors into consideration, in particular (Khlaifia and

Others v. Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, 160, 15 December 2016):

(a) The purpose for which the ill-treatment was inflicted, together with the intention

or motivation behind it, although the absence of an intention to humiliate or

debase the victim cannot conclusively rule out its characterisation as degrading

and therefore prohibited by Article 3.

(b) The context in which the ill-treatment was inflicted, such as an atmosphere of

heightened tension and emotions.

(c) Whether the victim is in a vulnerable situation.

31 Emphasis added.

55. In this regard, this Court has taken the view that use of force per se does not amount to

cruel inhuman or degrading treatment, consistently insisting upon a minimum level of

severity.33

56. Subasinghe v. Police Constable Sandun and Others,34 is one case where this Court

specifically arrived at a finding of degrading treatment. The petitioner, who was arrested

and assaulted with hands, kicked and beaten with a belt, was thereafter handcuffed and

taken to the Dankotuwa junction in a private bus and paraded around. The Court held

that,

The fact that the petitioner was taken handcuffed in a private vehicle to the

Dankotuwa town and exhibited in the manner spoken to by the petitioner in my

view, is an affront to the petitioners dignity as a human being and amounts to

degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 11.

57. In Mrs. W.M.K. De Silva v. Chairman, Fertilizer Corporation,35 Jameel, J observes

generally that ill-treatment per se, whether physical or mental, is not enough; a very

high degree of maltreatment is required. In this case, the petitioner, who was secretary

to the Chairman of the Fertilizer Corporation had made a statement to the CID with

respect to a potential impropriety which resulted in the latter being put under

investigation. The sour relations so began, first caused the petitioner to be sent on

compulsory leave. When she was eventually recalled, she was not given her old cubicle or

allocated any work. She was given a broken table and a broken chair and made to sit in

the verandah and even locked out at times. The Court found that, while the conditions

were humiliating and intolerable, and did certainly amount to grossly unfair labour

practice, it fell short of the degree of mental or physical coerciveness or viciousness

required to be categorised as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.36

58. As Dr. Amerasinghe, J observes in Our Fundamental Rights of Personal Security and

Physical Liberty,

"'Torture' implies that the suffering occasioned must be of a particular intensity or

cruelty. In order that ill-treatment may be regarded as inhuman or degrading it must

be 'severe'. There must be the attainment of a 'minimum level of severity'. There must

(be) the crossing of the 'threshold' set by the prohibition. There must be an

attainment of 'the seriousness of treatment envisaged by the prohibition in order to

sustain a case based on torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or

punishment."37

59. In Wijayasiriwardena v. Kumara, Inspector of Police, Kandy and Two Others,38 the

petitioner, a 16-year-old student, with a split lip and an injury on the cheek complained

of police assault and alleged that he was subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading

treatment. Even having found that the police had used excessive force in effecting the

arrest of the petitioner, wherein one of the respondents had dealt the schoolboy a blow

on the face, Mark Fernando, J found that this excessive force did not amount to cruel

inhuman or degrading treatment.

60. In deciding so, His Lordship reasoned as follows:

Police are not entitled to lay a finger on a person being arrested, even if he be a

hardened criminal, in the absence of attempts to resist or to escape. In the difficult

situation that existed at 11.30 a.m. that day, I hold that the 1st Respondent restrained

the Petitioner, holding him by the waist, while arresting him; upon the Petitioner

attempting to go back to the sanctuary of the school premises, the 1st Respondent

dealt him a blow on his face. While the use of some force was justified in the

circumstances, this was a quite excessive use of force. The use of excessive force

may well found an action for damages in delict, but does not per se amount

to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: that would depend on the person

and the circumstances. A degree of force which would be cruel in relation to a frail

old lady would not necessarily be cruel in relation to a tough young man; force

which would be degrading if used on a student inside a quiet orderly

classroom, would not be so regarded if used in an atmosphere charged with

tension and violence The 1st Respondents conduct in striking a single blow, does

not show any element of indifference or pleasure in causing pain and suffering, or of

intentional humiliation, or of brutal and unfeeling conduct. It is often easy after

an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet

it, but such criticism does not come well from those who have themselves

created the emergency. Banco de Portugal v. Waterlow & Sons [[1932] A.C. 452,

506]39

61. This approach taken by our courts is one that is very much consistent with that of the

European Court of Human Rights, which I have already referred to hereinabove. Differing

schools of thought exist as to the extent to which instruments such as the ECHR and

39 ibid at pp. 318-9 (Emphasis added)

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 26 of 37

related decision of foreign courts should influence our legal thinking. While I do not think

such instruments and judgments should dictate our legal thought, we may carefully derive

therefrom such guidance as appropriate with due regard to jurisdictional dissimilarities

and distinguishing features40 of our own legal cultureespecially so with jus cogens and

erga omnes norms of international law that receives constitutional recognition, such as

the prohibition of torture, for their universal relevance. In any event, this Court has oft

been guided by jurisprudence of international courtsespecially that of Strasbourg.

62. It is Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) that sets out the

prohibition of torture. The exact words of the provision states that No one shall be

subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. This provision

as can be seen, is nearly identical to Article 11 of our Constitution; however, with the

notable absence of the term cruel. The ECtHR as well as the English courts have

interpreted Article 3 of the ECHR to impose a positive obligation on the state to prevent

and investigate incidents of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in

addition to the negative obligation to refrain from subjecting persons to torture, inhuman

or degrading treatment or punishment.41 Similarly, under Article 11 of the Sri Lankan

40 One key dissimilarity between Strasbourg jusrisprudence and our own is the standard of proof applied in matters of this nature. While ECtHR has generally applied the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt when assessing evidence, this Court has consistently applied the standard of proof by a preponderance of probabilities as in a civil case.

For the standard of proof in Sri Lanka, see Goonewardene v. Perera [1983] 1 Sri L.R. 305, at p. 313; Kapugeekiyana v. Hettiarachchi and Others [1984] 2 Sri L.R. 153, at p. 165; Hettiarachchige Gemunu Tissa v. W. Lionel Jayaratne, Sub Inspector of Police, SC (FR) Application No: 417/2016, SC Minutes of 28th May 2024, at pp. 11-13

41 See among other authorities, for the English law position OOO (and others) v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis [2011] EWHC 1246 (QB) [143-49]; and for Strasbourg jurisprudence Z and Others v. The United Kingdom, Application No. 29392/95, 10th May 2001 (ECtHR GC)[72-73]; M.C. v. Bulgaria, Application No. 39272/98, 04th December 2003 (ECtHR) [151]; X and Others v. Bulgaria, Application No. 22457/16, 02nd February 2021 (ECtHR GC) [178]

Constitution, the State is enjoined to actively strive towards preventing incidents of

torture, inhuman or degrading treatment just as it is required to refrain from doing such

things that may constitute torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment: A

duty so clearly recognised in Article 4(d) of the Constitution.

63. Be that as it may, I find the Strasbourg jurisprudence particularly persuasive with respect

to its direction towards understanding the terms 'torture,' 'inhuman,' and 'degrading,' as

well as in setting a general standard against which a qualitative threshold may be set for

establishing torture, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment.

64. The definition of torture set out in the Convention Against Torture (cited hereinabove),

too, provides vital guidance in the instant case. The definition of torture in the

Convention is almost exactly adopted in the interpretation section in the Torture Act.

While slight variations are observable, the latter was clearly influenced by the formerfor

the Act was brought to fore for the very purpose of giving effect to Sri Lankas obligations

under the Convention. One striking variation is that the Torture Act has omitted in its

interpretation a vital explanation set out in the Convention text that [torture] does not

include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful

sanctions. However, this aspect was reflected in the recent judgment of Priyantha

Fernando, J in Wasana Niroshini Wickrama v. Nalaka and Others(supra):42

the petitioner has resisted lawful arrest Accordingly, when the husband of the

petitioner has asked the petitioner to go to the police station with the police officers,

OKeeffe v. Ireland, Application No. 35810/09, 28th January 2014 (ECtHR GC) [144-152] emphasised crucially, at 144 that This positive obligation to protect is to be interpreted in such a way as not to impose an excessive burden on the authorities, bearing in mind, in particular, the unpredictability of human conduct and operational choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources

42 SC FR 349/2014, SC Minutes of 16th October 2023 [33]

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 28 of 37

she has resisted stating that, she cannot get into to the police jeep unless a woman

police officer accompanies her. When a warrant has been issued, the person against

whom the warrant is issued is expected to comply with such warrant. The petitioner

could have avoided this entire course of events that allegedly caused her immense

psychological torture if she had complied with the said police officers who were

engaging in their official duty. One cannot make allegations of mental torture

for the acts which are incidental to lawful actions of officials acting within

their power.43

65. The ECtHR, too, has consistently stressed that, to come to a finding of torture or inhuman

or degrading treatment, the suffering and humiliation involved must go beyond that

inevitable element of suffering and humiliation connected with legitimate treatment or

sanctions in terms of the law.44

What the Video Footage Indicates

66. Returning to the circumstances of the application before us, this Court had the benefit of

carefully perusing certain video recordings. Among those videos were three news

coverages by two separate private media channelsone clearly capturing the very

moment the 1st Petitioner was arrested.

43 Emphasis added

44 See, among other authorities, Kudla v. Poland, Application No. 30210/96, 26th December 2000 (ECtHR GC) [92]; Jalloh v. Germany, Application No. 54810/00, 11th July 2006 (ECtHR GC) [68]; Muri v. Croatia, Application No. 7334/13, 20th October 2016 (ECtHR GC) [99]; Roth v. Germany, Application Nos. 6780/18 and 30776/18, 22nd December 2020 (ECtHR Fifth Section) [64]; Adamo v. Slovakia (No. 2), Application No. 55792/20, 12th December 2024 (ECtHR First Section) [81]; Ribar v. Slovakia, Application No. 56545/21, 12th December 2024 (ECtHR First Section) [94]

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 29 of 37

67. These videos clearly display an atmosphere charged with tension, violence and volatility.

Students can be seen pelting stones at the police as the police throw teargas and clenched

fists in return. The recordings also demonstrate a long line of students moving away from

the site of violence, just as the Petitioners described, but without any obstruction from

police officers. The officers can, in fact, be seen standing aside, allowing the students to

move away from violence.

68. The video footage further went on to show the adjoining road being used by pedestrians

including school children whilst the police were standing guard outside the University

premises.

69. While many students were seen moving away from the violence, it could be observed that

the 1st Petitioner had moved well towards the police and the site of tension. From the

footage the 1st Petitioner also appears to be hurling something towards the police, before

hasting back towards the University premises. It is at this point the police move to arrest

the said Petitioner.

70. The force used in effecting her arrest, grabbing her by the locks and the general

manhandling once arrested, is no doubt intense. The question is, however, is it so severe

that it amounts to torture. cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Considering the

specific circumstances of the instant application, I am inclined to answer this question in

the negative.

71. I am mostly guided by the volatility of the surrounding circumstances associated with the

events complained of. Had the circumstances been differentfor instance, if the students

were engaged in a peaceful protest or a vigil of sortsmy answer may have been

different.

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 30 of 37

72. The Respondents were tasked with keeping peace when such tension that could escalate

into a warzone in a split second prevailed. The circumstances did, in fact, result in the

hospitalisation of many officers. When we now critique the conduct of these officers in

retrospect, we must necessarily take cognisance of this tension and the anxiousness

associated with the atmosphere.

73. While I am sympathetic to her plight, clearly, the whole ordeal could have been avoided

if not for the questionable behaviour on the part of the 1st Petitioner herself.

74. The video footage also makes it clear that the Petitioners have not made a full and honest

disclosure before this Court, which compels me to take their narration of events with grain

of salt. The 1st Petitioner, especially, asserted that she was unable to leave the University

premises due to the commotion. I am at a loss to understand, then, as to why she would

move towards the commotion, as the video footage indicates.

What is Alleged with Respect to the 2nd Petitioner

75. With respect to the 2nd Petitioner, not much material has been placed before this Court

except for the assertion that he was severely assaulted and manhandled when he walked

up to the police as well as on their way to the police station and later at the police station.

76. The Petitioners specifically assert that the 2nd Petitioner was assaulted brutally with batons

at the time of arrest45 and that he was further assaulted at night by drunken police officers

while being kept at the police station.46

77. As the Petitioners do not complain of a violation of Article 13(2), it is clear that they have

been procedure before the Magistrate within twenty-four hours. Moreover, the

45 Petitioner of the Petitioner, para 17

46 Petition of the Petitioner, paras 19 and 20

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 31 of 37

Magistrates Court record of Case No. B/2711/05 produced before this Court indicates

two entries, one on 05th February 2009, on the day of the incident itself and another on

06th February 2009, at which point the learned Magistrate had made an order remanding

the Petitioners.

78. The alleged assaults are of such a nature that they should, in the ordinary course of things,

manifest themselves in the form of physical injuries. However, there is no indication that

any complaint was made to, or that any observation was made by, the Magistrate before

whom they were produced with respect to any such injuries. Moreover, the Petitioners,

including the others who were produced before the Magistrate, were all remanded for

seven days. Despite this, there is no indication of the 2nd Petitioner receiving treatment at

the prison, nor has he made any claim that such treatment was denied.

79. A medical report by an ENT Surgeon from the General Hospital of Kandy is attached,

marked P2, which indicates apparent injuries to his eardrum.47 There is no indication

therein corroborating the fact that he was assaulted in any way, other than an injury to

his eardrum. The date on this report appears to be either 14th or 19th February 2009, which

is a reasonable time after the alleged assault. It does not indicate with certainty that the

2nd Petitioner suffered this injury at the hands of the Respondent or while in police

custody.

80. It is trite law that, where Article 11 is concerned, some cogent proof with a high degree

of certainty must be placed before this Court before the balance of probabilities could be

said to tilt in favour of a petitioner.48 For the reasons I have adverted to above, I am of the

view that the Petitioners of the instant application have failed to produce sufficient proof

47 Marked P2 appended to the Petition of the Petitioners

48 Channa Pieris and Others v. Attorney-General and Other (Ratawesi Peramuna Case) [1994] 1 Sri L.R. 1, at p. 108

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 32 of 37

of such treatment that meet the severity threshold to establish torture or cruel, inhuman

or degrading treatment or punishment.

81. The humiliating and degrading treatment the Petitioners claimed to have gone through

is the inevitable and incidental suffering and humiliation associated with their arrest for

allegedly being members of an unlawful assembly under the chaotic circumstances which

prevailed at the time material. This, as already discussed, cannot be the basis of a finding

of degrading treatment.

82. As such, I am of the view that Petitioners have failed to establish any violations of their

rights guaranteed under Article 11 of the Constitution by the 2A Respondent or any other

Respondents.

Alleged violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

83. In addition to Article 11, the Petitioners also alleged violations of their rights guaranteed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Article 12(1) states that; All persons are equal

before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law

84. Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution can be violated by

discriminatory and unequal treatment as against those similarly circumstanced, in the

narrower sense, or by unlawful, arbitrary or mala fide actions and/or inactions that stands

obnoxious to the Rule of Law,49 in the wider and more complete sense.

85. As I have already adverted to, the Respondents were tasked with maintaining peace in

and around the University at a time when hostilities were at an all-time high, with an

unlawful assembly literally afoot.

86. Section 23 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 sets out the general

procedural provisions on how an arrest must be made:

(1) In making an arrest the person making the same shall actually touch or confine

the body of the person to be arrested unless there be a submission to the custody

by word or action

(2) If such person forcibly resists the endeavour to arrest him or attempts to evade

the arrest, the person making the arrest may use such means as are reasonably

necessary to effect the arrest

87. Section 95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 provides for the dispersal

of an unlawful assembly as follows:

(1) Any Magistrate or police officer not below the rank of Inspector of Police may

command any unlawful assembly or any assembly of five or more persons likely

to cause a disturbance of the public peace to disperse, and it shall thereupon be

the duty of the member of such assembly to disperse accordingly.

(2) If upon being so commanded any such assembly does not disperse or if without

being so commanded it conducts itself in such a manner as to show a

determination not to disperse, the Magistrate or the police officer may proceed

to disperse such assembly by the use of such force as is reasonably

necessary to disperse the assembly and may require the assistance of any person

(not being a member of the Army, Navy or Air Force, whether of Sri Lanka or of

any other country, acting as such) for the purpose of dispersing such assembly

and if necessary arresting and confining the persons who form part of it in

order to disperse such assembly or that they may be punished according to law

88. As it is apparent, the Code of Criminal Procedure Act empowers police officers not below

the rank of Inspector of Police to command the dispersal of an unlawful assembly, as the

Respondents have done in the instant case, and proceed to use such force as is

reasonably necessary for the dispersal where such commands for dispersal are to no avail.

89. As I have noted earlier in the judgment, the Petitioners were not able to establish much

of the mistreatment complained of with evidence of sufficient cogency. In addition to this,

the improbabilities in the Petitioners pleadings undermine their credibility and leave me

reluctant to place full confidence in their statements or accept them at face value. As such,

this Court can only take cognisance of such mistreatment that has been established by

evidence. What the Petitioners have satisfactorily established is that they were treated

very harshly and that they were manhandled, as the Petitioners described, at the time of

arrest. The 1st Petitioner particularly complained of being grabbed by her hair.

90. I cannot, for a moment, condone the use of such force in effecting arrests in general. The

use of such force must not be the norm but the exception, to be deployed only when

strictly necessary. No amount of force, howsoever small, is justified against those who are

compliant and do not resist. While that may be so, whether the use of force was done as

is reasonably necessary must necessarily be considered with reference to the

circumstances. In the instance case, the arrested were effected when the atmosphere was

SC FR 155/2009 JUDGMENT Page 35 of 37

charged with such violence that resulted in the hospitalisation of several police officers as

well as many University students.

91. In these circumstances, I take the view that the Respondents have acted within the bounds

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Moreover, the facts, in my view, do not disclose

any mala fide treatment or treatment ad hominem with respect to any of the Petitioners

on the part of the 2A Respondent or any of the other Respondents.

CONCLUSION

92. The Petitioners case, first and foremost, related to Article 11 of the Constitution, which

prohibits torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. No other allegation under

fundamental rights jurisdiction carries a greater stigma. This severity has long compelled

this Court to insist upon a high degree of proof before a violation can satisfactorily be

found.

93. Though evocative, the Petitioners narration of events itself, for its many inconsistencies

and improbabilities, failed to meet this high threshold. In the video footage, the 1st

Petitioner could be seen possibly hurling something at the policecertainly having

moved towards themwhen other students were peacefully moving away from the chaos

without any obstructions from the officers present. This stands in stark contrast to what is

averred in her affidavit.

94. While it was apparent that she was dealt a firm hand as she was apprehended, the

precedent of this Court reveals that the mere use of force, and the suffering or humiliation

inherent and incidental to lawful sanctions, cannot serve as the basis for a finding under

Article 11. The revelation that she had played a part in the humiliating circumstances

complained of, and that she had not been entirely truthful the Court, led this Court to

consider her submissions with caution.

95. The evidence relied upon by the 2nd Petitioner was even less reliable. While physical

injuries are by no means a sine qua non for establishing violations of Article 11, it is

unimaginable that such severe assaults as the 2nd Petitioner complained of would leave

no physical clues. Although he was produced before a Magistrate and remanded within

twenty-four hours, he was not observed to have, nor has he complained of, any injuries

or symptoms that should ordinarily result from such assaults he described.

96. While medical reports, especially from government institutions, ordinarily bear great

probative value in cases of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the report

produced by the 2nd Petitioner indicated no injuries other than damage to his eardrum.

This injury, too, could not be incontestably attributed to the events in question, as the

report was obtained a reasonable time after the said event.

97. As such, I am of the view that the Petitioners have failed to establish any violations of

Article 11 of the Constitution with respect to either of the Petitioners by the 2nd

Respondent or any of the other Respondents.

98. Insofar as Article 12(1) is concerned, Sections 23 and 95 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, No. 15 of 1979 authorise police officers to use such force as may be reasonably

necessary in order to arrest a person who forcibly resists and to disperse an unlawful

assembly under certain specific conditions.

99. It was evident that the instant case is one that fall within such conditions. I am of the view

that Respondents have acted in good faith within the limits of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

100. As such, I find no violations of Article 12(1) of the Constitution with respect to any of the

Petitioners by the 2A Respondent or any one of the other Respondents.

101. Since I have found no violations of Article 11 or Article 12(1) of the Constitution

hereinabove, the Petition is accordingly dismissed.

Application Dismissed.
