"","Magistrate’s  Court record  of  Case No. B/2711/05 produced  before  this  Court  indicates"
"","two entries, one on 05th February 2009, on the day of the  incident  itself and another on"
"","06th February 2009, at which point the learned Magistrate had made an order remanding"
"","the Petitioners."
"78.  The alleged assaults are of such a nature that they should, in the ordinary course of things,",""
"","manifest themselves in the form of physical injuries. However, there is no indication that"
"","any complaint was made to, or that  any observation was made by, the Magistrate  before"
"","whom they  were produced  with respect  to  any such injuries. Moreover, the  Petitioners,"
"","including  the  others  who  were  produced  before  the  Magistrate,  were  all remanded  for"
"","seven days. Despite this, there is no indication of the 2nd Petitioner receiving treatment at"
"","the prison, nor has he made any claim that such treatment  was denied."
"79.  A  medical  report  by  an  ENT Surgeon  from the  General  Hospital  of  Kandy  is  attached,",""
"","marked  ‘P2’, which  indicates  apparent  injuries to  his eardrum. 47  There  is no indication"
"","therein corroborating  the fact  that he  was assaulted  in any way, other than  an  injury to"
"","his eardrum. The date on this report appears to be either 14th or 19th February 2009, which"
"","is a reasonable time after the alleged  assault. It  does not indicate  with certainty  that the"
"","2nd  Petitioner  suffered  this  injury  at  the  hands  of  the  Respondent  or  while  in  police"
"","custody."
"80.","It is trite law that, where Article 11 is concerned,  some cogent  proof  with a high degree"
"","of certainty  must be placed before this Court before the balance of probabilities could be"
"","said to tilt in favour of a petitioner.48 For the reasons I have adverted to above, I am of the"
"","view that the Petitioners of the instant application have failed to produce sufficient proof"
