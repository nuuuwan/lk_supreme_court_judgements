"","cruel inhuman or degrading  treatment,  consistently  insisting upon a ‘minimum level of"

"56.  Subasinghe v.  Police  Constable  Sandun and Others,34  is one  case  where  this Court",""
"","specifically arrived at a finding of ‘degrading treatment’. The petitioner, who was arrested"
"","and assaulted with hands, kicked and beaten  with a  belt, was thereafter  handcuffed  and"
"","taken  to the  Dankotuwa  junction  in a private bus and  paraded  around. The  Court  held"
"","that,"
"","“The  fact  that  the  petitioner  was  taken  handcuffed  in  a  private  vehicle  to  the"

"","view, is  an affront to the  petitioner’s  dignity as  a  human being and amounts  to"
"","“degrading treatment” within the meaning of Article 11.”"

"","compulsory leave. When she was eventually recalled, she was not given her old cubicle or"
