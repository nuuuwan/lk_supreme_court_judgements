"95.  The  evidence  relied  upon  by  the  2nd  Petitioner  was  even  less  reliable.  While  physical"
"injuries are  by  no  means  a  sine  qua non  for  establishing  violations  of  Article  11, it  is"
"unimaginable that  such severe assaults as the  2nd Petitioner  complained  of would  leave"
"no physical clues. Although  he was produced  before  a Magistrate  and remanded  within"
"twenty-four hours, he was not observed to have, nor has he  complained  of, any injuries"
"or symptoms that should ordinarily result from such assaults he described."
