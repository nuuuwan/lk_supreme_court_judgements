"In deciding so, His Lordship reasoned as follows:",""
"","“…Police are not entitled to lay a finger on a person being arrested, even if he be a"

"","may well found an action for damages in delict, but does not per se amount"
"","to cruel,  inhuman or degrading treatment: that would depend on the person"
"","and the circumstances. A degree of force which would be cruel in relation to a frail"
"","old lady would not  necessarily be cruel in  relation to  a tough young man;  force"
"","which  would  be  degrading  if  used  on  a  student  inside  a  quiet  orderly"
"","classroom, would not be so regarded if used in an atmosphere charged with"
"","tension and violence… The 1st Respondent’s conduct in striking a single blow, does"
"","not show any element of indifference or pleasure in causing pain and suffering, or of"
"","intentional humiliation, or of brutal and unfeeling conduct. “It is often easy after"
"","an emergency has passed to criticize the steps which have been taken to meet"
