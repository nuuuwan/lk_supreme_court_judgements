"Channa  Pieris  and  Others  v.  Attorney-General  and  Other  (Ratawesi  Peramuna"
"“…the acts or conducts complained of must be qualitatively of a kind that the"
"Court can take cognizance of. Where it is not so, the Court will not declare that"
"Article 11 has been violated…"
"…As to whether a particular act satisfies the relevant criteria is not an easy matter to"
"determine. The assessment is in the nature of things, relative and depends on"
"all the circumstances of the case including the nature and context of the act"
"and the manner and method of its commission. (Cf. the decision of the European"
"Court of Human Rights in the Tyrer case. [European Court of Human Rights Decision"
"of  25.04.1978] As  it  was  observed in  Gunasekera v.  Kumara and  Other  (supra),"
"adopting dicta from Hobbs v. London & S.W. Railway [(1875) LR 10 QB 111, 121],"
"the decision whether an act is qualitatively of the kind that contravenes Article 11 “is"
"something like having to draw a line between night and day; there is a great duration"
"of twilight when it is neither night nor day; but on the question now before the Court,"
"though you cannot draw the precise line you can say on which side of the line the"
"case is.”"
