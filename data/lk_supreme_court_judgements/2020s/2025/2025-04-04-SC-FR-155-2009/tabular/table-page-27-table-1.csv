"","to its direction  towards understanding  the terms 'torture,' 'inhuman,' and 'degrading,' as"
"","well as in setting  a general standard against  which a qualitative threshold may be set for"

"64.  The definition  of  ‘torture’ set out in the  Convention Against Torture (cited  hereinabove),",""
"too,  provides  vital  guidance","in 
the 
instant  case.  The  definition  of 
‘torture’ 
in  the"
"Convention  is  almost  exactly  adopted","in  the  interpretation  section  in  the  Torture  Act."
"","While slight variations are observable, the latter was clearly influenced by the former—for"
"","the Act was brought to fore for the very purpose of giving effect to Sri Lanka’s obligations"
"","under  the  Convention.  One  striking  variation is that  the  Torture Act  has  omitted  in its"
"","interpretation  a vital explanation set out in the Convention text  that “…[torture] does not"
"","include  pain or  suffering  arising  only  from,  inherent  in  or  incidental  to  lawful"
"sanctions”.  However,  this  aspect  was  reflected","in  the 
recent 
judgment  of  Priyantha"
