"The Court  has considered  treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter  alia, it"
"was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual"
"bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering (see Labita, cited above,"
"§ 120, and Ramirez Sanchez, cited above, § 118). Treatment has been held to be"
"“degrading” when it  was  such  as  to  arouse  in  its  victims  feelings  of  fear,"
"anguish  and  inferiority  capable  of  humiliating  and  debasing  them  and"
"possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance, or when it was such as to"
"drive the victim to act against his will or  conscience (see, inter alia, Keenan v."
"the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, § 110, ECHR 2001-III, and Jalloh, cited above, §"
"68).”29"
