Argued on: 30.04.2025

Written submissions:

By the Petitioner on 4.6.2025.

By the 1st to 11th, 13th and 14th Respondents on 2.6.2025.

By the 15th to 18th Respondents on 11.6.2025.

Decided on: 07.07.2025

Samayawardhena, J.

The three petitioners filed this application on 04.10.2019, alleging that their

fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution were violated by the respondents through the appointment of

the 15ᵗʰ to 18ᵗʰ respondents to the post of Technical Administrator, pursuant

to the board decision dated 31.07.2019, marked P17. This Court granted

leave to proceed on the alleged violation of Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution.

10

SC/FR/382/2019

The petitioners and the 15ᵗʰ to 18ᵗʰ respondents are employees of the 1ˢᵗ

respondent, the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. Applications were

called for internal promotions to the post of Technical Administrator, Grade

JM 1-1, in respect of 20 vacancies. Following the interviews, candidates who

secured 80 marks or more were promoted to the said post, and the

vacancies were accordingly filled. This process took place in 2014. The

petitioners were not among those selected at that time.

The complaint of the petitioners is that the promotion of the 15ᵗʰ to 18ᵗʰ

respondents in 2019 to the said post is in violation of Articles 12(1) and

14(1)(g) of the Constitution. Their contention is that, according to the

“waiting list” tendered by the petitioners marked P7, they ought to have

been promoted to the said post.

According to P7:

The 1ˢᵗ petitioner is listed at No. 24 on the waiting list and had

obtained 79 marks at the interview.

The 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ petitioners are placed at Nos. 29 and 30, respectively,

and had each secured 77 marks.

The 15ᵗʰ respondent is listed at No. 23 on the waiting list, with 79

marks at the interview.

The 16ᵗʰ, 17ᵗʰ, and 18ᵗʰ respondents are placed at Nos. 26, 27, and 28,

respectively, and had each obtained 77 marks.

If I may go by the waiting list tendered by the petitioners themselves, it was

unjustifiable to have promoted the 16ᵗʰ, 17ᵗʰ, and 18ᵗʰ respondents over the

1ˢᵗ petitioner, as the 1ˢᵗ petitioner had obtained higher marks than each of

them.

11

SC/FR/382/2019

On the other hand, although the 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ petitioners obtained the same

marks as the 16ᵗʰ, 17ᵗʰ, and 18ᵗʰ respondents, they were ranked lower on the

waiting list. Moreover, the 16ᵗʰ, 17ᵗʰ, and 18ᵗʰ respondents are far senior in

service when compared to the 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ petitioners.

I declare that the fundamental rights of the 1ˢᵗ petitioner guaranteed under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution has been violated. Accordingly, I direct the

1ˢᵗ and 2ⁿᵈ respondents—the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and its

Chairman—to appoint the 1ˢᵗ petitioner U.P.E. Wijesuriya (Service No. 1423)

to the post of Technical Administrator, with effect from 01.08.2014, without

payment of arrears of salary, in the same manner as was done in respect of

the 15ᵗʰ to 18ᵗʰ respondents.
