"Therefore, the English Law clearly lays down that a demand made on a Guarantee"
"Bond which is commonly called demand guarantee is an autonomous contract. It’s not a"
"part of the underlying contract. Thus, there is no doubt that a cause of action, can be raised"
"on the demand guarantee."
"Ref:  Edward  Owen  Engineering  Ltd  v  Barclays  Bank  International  Ltd  [1978]"
"1 Q.B.159;    Standard Bank London Ltd v Canara Bank [2002] EWHC 1032 (Comm)."
"In order to sue or litigate on a guarantee, the most essential factor is that a demand"
"should  be  made.  That  too,  in  the  first  instance.  When  a  demand  is  made  and  it  is  not"
"honoured  only,  a  cause  of  action  accrues  for  a  creditor  to  sue  the  debtor  and  where"
"necessary the guarantor."
"Ref:  Sivasubramanium  v  Alagamuttu  53  NLR  150;      Seylan  Bank  Limited  v"
"Intertrade Garments Private Limited (2005) 1 SLR 80;  Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka v"
"Budhadasa and another  2002 BALR 64   and   L.B. Finance Ltd. v Manchanayake  (2000)"
"2 SLR 142."
"If  I  may  apply  the  above  principles  to  the  present  case,  the  Guarantee  Bond  P9"
"(which  was  for  USD  One  Million)  in  Clause  1  (vii)  defines  ‘monies’  to  include  monies"
"which may now and which shall from time to time become due, and remain unpaid to the"
"Bank and also any advances, overdraft or any transaction whatsoever. As per Clause 3,"
"the guarantee is a continuing security. Clause 4 refers to a termination of guarantee."
"In the instant case, while no evidence was led by the Appellant that the continuing"
"guarantee has been cancelled and / or discharged as per Clause 4 of the Guarantee Bond"
"the contention of the Bank before this Court was that the most important feature of the"
"Guarantee Bond P9, was that the Appellant, being a Director and Managing Director of"
"the 1st Defendant Company had guaranteed the re-payment of sums overdue, and interest"
"thereon  upon a cafeteria of facilities given  by the Bank,  to the 1st Defendant Company,"
"subject however, to a limit viz.,  USD One Million being the sum guaranteed."
"Having examined the Clauses of the Guarantee Bond, I see merit in the contention"
"of the Bank, that the Guarantee Bond P9 is a continuing security and covers loans, facilities"
"and all borrowings made by the 1st Defendant Company. It will not get discharged upon"
"one such facility of the cafeteria of facilities and / or a loan being re-paid."
"I  also  observe  that  the  Appellant,  who  is  the  Guarantor,  has  failed  to  lead  any"
"evidence to establish that the guarantee lapsed prior to signing of the Loan Agreement P5"
"and / or that the Guarantor, being the Managing Director of the 1st Defendant Company"
"was  completely  unaware  of  the  Loan  Agreement  executed  in  the  year  2003.  The  Loan"
"Agreement is the underlying contract upon which the  Bank has sued the 1st Defendant"
"Company. Though it would have been desirable to have referred to the Guarantee Bond"
