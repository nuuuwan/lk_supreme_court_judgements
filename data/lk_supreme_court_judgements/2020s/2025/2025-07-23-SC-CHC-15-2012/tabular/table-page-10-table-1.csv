"when the facility P5 was granted in the year 2003, non- reference in my view, does not"
"necessarily mean that the security or the guarantee is not applicable."
"I reiterate that the principle that underlies a demand guarantee is that each contract"
"is autonomous. Thus, when a demand is made on the guarantee and if the guarantor has"
"failed  to  honour  such  demand,  a  cause  of  action  arises.  Even  if  a  guarantor  fails  to"
"acknowledge or fails to respond, a cause of action arises. These contentions are based on"
"the principle that in business matters if a party receiving a letter disputes certain assertions"
"contained in it, he must reply henceforth and failure to do so, amounts to an admission of"
"the claim made therein."

"and Lighting Co. Ltd v  Pereira 25 NLR 193 and   Seneviratne and another v Lanka Orix"

"Based upon the aforeatsted principles, the failure of the Appellant, in the present"
"case,  to  respond  to  the  Letter  of  Demand,  in  my  view,  heightens  the  liability  of  the"
"Appellant, with regard to the sum claimed."
"Coming back to the autonomous nature of a demand guarantee, which is the crux"
"of this case, it is evident that the rationale for honouring of a guarantee is paramount. It is"
"an irrevocable obligation assumed by the guarantor. The reason for these principles to be"
"embedded in our law is because the demand guarantees are the lifeblood of international"
"trade and commerce. Such obligations are regarded as collateral to the underlying rights"
"and  obligations,  free  from  interference  by  courts.  The  courts  will  intervene,  in  these"
"relationships only in the case of a clear fraud."

"Moreover, in the instant case in Clause 18 and 19 of the Guarantee Bond P9 parties"
"i.e., the Bank and the Appellant, have agreed upon the Bank’s right and liberty to proceed"
"against the guarantor in the first instance, since the guarantor has enunciated all privileges"
"which were encapsulated in the legal maxim Beneficium Ordinis. Such right of the Bank to"
"proceed against a particular party first, is accepted by consent and is referred to as the"
"‘absolute discretion of the Bank’ in the said clauses."
