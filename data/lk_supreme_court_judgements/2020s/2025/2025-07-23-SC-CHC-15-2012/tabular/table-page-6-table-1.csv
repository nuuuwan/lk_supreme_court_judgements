"The Appellant further put forward the contention that the Respondent Bank cannot"
"claim on the Guarantee Bond since in the instant case too, as in Rumeco Case, the cause"
"of action was based on a facility granted in 2003 and the guarantee bond was executed in"
"the year 1999."
"Responding  to  same,  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Bank  argued,  that  the  said"
"Rumeco case can be distinguished from the Appeal before this Court."
"Hence, I wish to advert to the facts of the Rumeco case."
"In the said case, the Hatton National Bank granted a term loan to the 1st defendant"
"Rumeco Ltd., in 1995. This term loan was secured by the 1st defendant company and the"
"2nd  defendant,  by  two  mortgage  bonds  executed  in  the  year  1987  and  1993.  Upon  the"
"company, failing to re-pay the loan, the bank sued the 1st, 2nd and the 3rd defendants. The"
"1st  defendant  and  the  2nd  defendant  failed  to  present  themselves  before  court  and  trial"
"proceeded ex-parte against the said 1st and 2nd defendants and judgement was obtained."
"H
owever, the evidence presented by the bank against the 3rd defendant, was on a"
"different basis, viz, re-scheduling of a loan originally given to the 1st defendant in 1992 and"
"guaranteed by the 3rd defendant also in 1992. Upon non-payment of this loan the facility"
"was re-scheduled in 1995. That is the facility that was secured by the 1st and 2nd defendants."
"Non honouring of the said facility was the cause of action pleaded by the bank against the"
"1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants. The reference to the 1992 facility was not pleaded in the plaint."
"The guarantee given by the 3rd defendants in 1992 and the re-scheduling of the facility was"
"not a part of the pleadings. The trial judge dismissed the case against the 3rd defendant"
"holding that the transaction sued was the term loan granted in 1995 and not the  facility"
"given in 1992 and therefore there was no guarantee given by the 3rd Respondent nor the"
"guarantee  given  in  1992  can  be  considered  a  continuing  guarantee.  The  trial  Judges"
"findings  were  upheld  by  the  High  Court  referring  also  to  the  principle  of  novation  of"
"contract."
"From the aforesaid, I see merit in the contention of the Counsel for the Respondent"
"Bank,  that  Rumeco  case  can  be  distinguished  from  the  facts  of  the  Appeal  before  this"
"Court. Furthermore, there is no dispute that a novation discharges the original obligation"
"and the obligations accessory to it. In my view the facts of the instant Appeal do not fall"
"within the realm of ‘novation’ and on such ground too, Rumeco case can be distinguished."

egal submissions"
"In the case of Union Bank of Colombo Ltd. v Emm Chem Pvt Ltd.  SC/App/CHC"
"22/2011, 07.03.2019 the contention of the appellant was that the guarantee bonds cannot"
"be  enforced  for  future  and  antecedent  debts.  This  Court  referring  to  Paget’s  Law  of"
"Banking 12th Ed, and having considered the dicta in the aforesaid Hatton National Bank"
