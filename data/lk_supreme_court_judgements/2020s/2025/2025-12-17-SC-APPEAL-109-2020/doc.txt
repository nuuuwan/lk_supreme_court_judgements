Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted action in the District Court of Polonnaruwa seeking

a declaration of title to the land described in Schedule A to the plaint,

ejectment of the defendant from the land described in Schedule B thereto,

which forms part of Schedule A, and damages. The defendant filed answer

praying for the dismissal of the plaintiff’s action and made a cross-claim for

compensation in respect of improvements, in the event the Court were to

hold in favour of the plaintiff. Upon conclusion of the trial, the District Court

entered judgment in favour of the plaintiff and dismissed the defendant’s

cross-claim.

On appeal by the defendant, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Anuradhapura

set aside the judgment of the District Court and allowed the appeal on the

ground that the plaintiff had failed to succeed to the land as required by

section 68(2) of the Land Development Ordinance.

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the High Court, the plaintiff

preferred this appeal with leave obtained. This Court had granted leave to

appeal on the following two questions of law:

(a) Did the High Court fail to appreciate that the defendant did not raise

an issue in the District Court in regard to the failure of the plaintiff

to comply with section 68(2) of the Land Development Ordinance?

3

SC/APPEAL/109/2020

(b) Did the High Court fail to appreciate that the defendant did not lead

evidence to the effect that the plaintiff did not enter into possession

of the land?

The plaintiff is the younger brother of the defendant. In terms of section 19

of the Land Development Ordinance, their father was issued a Grant in

respect of the land described in Schedule A to the plaint in 1982. The father

nominated the plaintiff as the successor to the land. The father died on

20.11.1994 and the mother on 18.12.2011. The plaintiff instituted action

in the District Court on 03.10.2012 on the basis that he is the lawful owner

of the entire land as the duly nominated successor.

In terms of section 48 of the Land Development Ordinance, upon the death

of a permit-holder or owner of a holding (grantee), the spouse is entitled to

succeed to the land or holding, whether or not such spouse has been

nominated as a successor.

48A(1). Upon the death of a permit-holder who at the time of his or her

death was required to pay any annual instalments by virtue of the

provisions of subsection (2) of section 19, notwithstanding default in

the payment of such instalments, the spouse of that permit-holder,

whether he or she has or has not been nominated as successor by that

permit-holder, shall be entitled to succeed to the land alienated to that

permit-holder on the permit and the terms and conditions of that permit

shall be applicable to that spouse.

(2) If, during the lifetime of the spouse of a deceased permit-holder who

has succeeded under subsection (1) to the land alienated on the permit,

the terms and conditions of the permit are complied with by such

spouse, such spouse shall be entitled to a grant of that land subject to

the following conditions:-

4

SC/APPEAL/109/2020

(a) such spouse shall have no power to dispose of the land alienated

by the grant;

(b) such spouse shall have no power to nominate a successor to that

land;

(c) upon the death of such spouse, or upon his or her marriage, the

person, who was nominated as successor by the deceased

permit-holder or who would have been entitled to succeed as his

successor, shall succeed to that land:

Provided that the aforesaid conditions shall not apply to a grant of any

land to be made to a spouse who has been nominated by the deceased

permit-holder to succeed to the land alienated on the permit.

(3) Any disposition or nomination made by a spouse in contravention of

the provisions of subsection (2) shall be invalid.

48B(1). Upon the death of the owner of a holding, the spouse of that

owner shall be entitled to succeed to that holding subject to the

following conditions:-

(a) upon the marriage of such spouse, title to the holding shall

devolve on the nominated successor of the deceased owner or, if

there was no such nomination, on the person who was entitled

to succeed under rule 1 of the Third Schedule;

(b) such spouse shall have no power to dispose of that holding;

(c) such spouse shall have no power to nominate a successor to that

holding:

Provided that the aforesaid conditions shall not apply to a spouse who

has been nominated by the deceased owner of the holding to succeed

to that holding.

5

SC/APPEAL/109/2020

(2) Any disposition or nomination made by a spouse in contravention of

the provisions of subsection (1) shall be invalid.

In terms of section 49 of the Land Development Ordinance, where the

spouse fails to succeed to the land or holding, or where the spouse has

succeeded and subsequently dies, the person nominated as successor by

the permit-holder or grantee shall succeed to such land or holding.

49. Upon the death of a permit-holder who at the time of his or her

death was paying an annual instalment by virtue of the provisions of

section 19, or of an owner of a holding, without leaving behind his or

her spouse, or, where such permit-holder or owner died leaving behind

his or her spouse, upon the failure of such spouse to succeed to the

land alienated to that permit-holder on the permit or holding or upon

the death of such spouse, a person nominated as successor by such

permit-holder or owner shall succeed to that land or holding.

In terms of section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance, where both the

spouse and the nominated successor fail to succeed, succession to the land

or holding shall take place in the manner prescribed in Rule 1 of the Third

Schedule to the Ordinance.

72. If no successor has been nominated, or if the nominated successor

fails to succeed, or if the nomination of a successor contravenes the

provisions of this Ordinance, the title to the land alienated on a permit

to a permit-holder who at the time of his or her death was paying an

annual instalment by virtue of the provisions of section 19 or to the

holding of an owner shall, upon the death of such permit-holder or

owner without leaving behind his or her spouse, or, where such permit-

holder or owner died leaving behind his or her spouse, upon the failure

of such spouse to succeed to that land or holding, or upon the death of

such spouse, devolve as prescribed in rule 1 of the Third Schedule.

6

SC/APPEAL/109/2020

Section 68 of the Land Development Ordinance defines the meaning of the

term “failure to succeed”. In terms of section 68(1), a spouse fails to succeed

where such spouse refuses to succeed to the land or holding, or fails to

enter into possession of the land or holding within a period of six months

reckoned from the date of death of the permit-holder or grantee. In terms of

section 68(2), a nominated successor fails to succeed where such

nominated successor refuses to succeed to the land or holding, or fails to

enter into possession of the land or holding within a period of six months

reckoned from the date of death of the permit-holder or grantee where the

permit-holder or grantee dies without leaving a spouse, or, where the

permit-holder or grantee dies leaving a spouse, from the date of the failure

of such spouse to succeed or from the date of death of such spouse.

68(1). The spouse of a deceased permit-holder, who at the time of his

or her death was paying an annual instalment by virtue of the

provisions of section 19, or the spouse of an owner, fails to succeed to

the land held by such permit-holder on the permit or to the holding of

such owner, as the case may be—

(a) if such spouse refuses to succeed to that land or holding, or

(b) if such spouse does not enter into possession of that land or holding

within a period of six months reckoned from the date of the death of

such permit-holder or owner.

(2) A nominated successor fails to succeed to the land held on a permit

by a permit-holder who at the time of his or her death was paying an

annual instalment by virtue of the provisions of section 19 or to the

holding of an owner if he refuses to succeed to that land or holding, or,

if the nominated successor does not enter into possession of that land

or holding within a period of six months reckoned—

7

SC/APPEAL/109/2020

(i) where such permit-holder or owner dies without leaving behind his

or her spouse, from the date of the death of such permit-holder or

owner; or

(ii) where such permit-holder or owner dies leaving behind his or her

spouse, from the date of the failure of such spouse to succeed, such

date being reckoned according to the provisions of paragraph (b) of

subsection (1), or of the death of such spouse, as the case may be.

It is necessary to state at this stage that possession is mainly of two kinds,

namely actual possession and constructive possession. Section 68 shall be

construed as encompassing both forms of possession. To hold otherwise

would defeat the statutory scheme and place a surviving spouse,

particularly one of advanced age, at an unfair disadvantage, as such a

spouse may be incapable of entering into physical possession of the land

upon the death of the permit-holder or owner.

In the plaint, the plaintiff himself pleaded that the defendant had forcibly

entered into possession of the portion of land described in Schedule B while

the father was still alive. In cross-examination, the plaintiff unequivocally

admitted that the defendant had been in possession of that portion since

1980. The defendant in his evidence stated that he had been residing there

with his family from 1978. The action was instituted in the District Court

on 03.10.2012. These facts, which emerged both from the pleadings and

from admissions made in evidence, were never in controversy at any stage

of the trial. Accordingly, the submission of learned counsel for the plaintiff

that the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained on the ground

that no issue was raised at the trial on succession in terms of section 68(2)

is without merit.

In Nevil Fernando v. Sanath Fernando [2024/25] BLR 78, I had occasion to

explain the law on the impermissibility of shifting positions from pleadings

8

SC/APPEAL/109/2020

to trial and thereafter on appeal, subject to strictly limited exceptions, in

the following terms:

A party to an action is subject to specific constraints in presenting his

case before Court. There must be consistency in how the case is

presented from the original Court to the final Court. He cannot keep

changing his position to suit the occasion. There must be an end to

litigation. Firstly, a party cannot, by way of issues, present a case

different from what was pleaded in his pleadings. Secondly, once

issues are raised and accepted by Court, a party cannot present a

different case at the trial from what was raised by way of issues.

Thirdly, once the judgment is pronounced by Court, the losing party

cannot present a different case before the appellate Court from what

was presented in the Court below, unless the new ground is a pure

question of law and not a question of fact or a mixed question of fact

and law. However, a practice has developed in our Courts to entertain

questions of fact for the first time on appeal subject to strict conditions,

which have been discussed in The Tasmania (1890) 15 App. Cases 223

and Appuhamy v. Nona (1912) 15 NLR 311. The cumulative effect of

these two leading decisions is that a question of fact can be raised for

the first time in appeal if:

(a) “it might have been put forward in the Court below under some

one or other of the issues framed”; and

(b) “if it is satisfied beyond doubt” that

(i) “it [the appellate Court] has before it all the facts bearing upon

the new contention, as completely as would have been the case

if the controversy had arisen at the trial”; and

(ii) “no satisfactory explanation could have been offered by those

whose conduct is impugned, if an opportunity for explanation

had been afforded them when in the witness box”.

9

SC/APPEAL/109/2020

On the unique facts and circumstances of this case, I am satisfied that all

facts bearing upon the contention relating to failure to succeed in terms of

section 68(2) of the Land Development Ordinance were before the High

Court and, as stated earlier, those facts were never in dispute. The case

therefore falls within the recognised exception permitted by law. In these

circumstances, the High Court was well within its jurisdiction in

entertaining and deciding that issue.

Accordingly, I answer the questions of law upon which leave to appeal was

granted in the negative and dismiss the appeal. I make no order as to costs.
