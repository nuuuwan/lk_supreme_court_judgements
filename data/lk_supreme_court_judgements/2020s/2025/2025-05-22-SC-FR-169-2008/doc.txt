Argued on: 30.05.2023

Decided on: 05.10.2023

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

151 Co-operative Inspectors attached to the Department of Co-operative Development of the

Western Province, had complained of the violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed under

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution by the Executive or Administrative action taken by the 1st to the 7th

Respondents.

When the matter was supported for leave on the 26th of August 2008, this Court having considered

the material placed before the Court had granted leave to proceed for alleged infringement of Article

12 (1) of the Constitution. After the leave to proceed was granted and the matter was fixed for

hearing, on 30th April 2009, an application was supported on behalf of 17 Intervenient Petitioners.

The Petitioners did not object to the said intervention, and the request for intervention was permitted

by this Court. The Intervenient Petitioners were named as 16th -32nd added respondents to the instant

application.

As revealed before us the main grievance that was complained by the Petitioners, was the decision

by the Western Provincial Council to place a group of Co-operative Inspectors at a higher salary step

against the scheme of Recruitment (hereinafter referred to as SOR) applicable to the Co-operative

Inspectors Service.

14 At the time the alleged violation took place the SOR to the post of Co-operative Inspectors Service

consisted of 3 grades namely Class II-B, Class II-A, and Class I. In terms of the SOR, the recruitment

Grade was Class II-B and the basic requirement for entry into Class II-B was Four passes at the GCE

(Advance Level) Examination and a pass at the Co-operative Employees Certificate (Advance)

Examination conducted by the Co-operative School Polgolla was considered as an added qualification.

As per the SOR Co-operative Inspectors in Class II-B who have been confirmed in that grade and have

five years of satisfactory service and successfully completed the Second Examination held for Co-

operative Inspectors by Co-operative College were eligible to be promoted to Class II- A of the Co-

operative Inspectors Service.

Promotions to Class I was made on the availability of vacancies based on seniority from among Co-

operative Inspectors who have completed 5 years of satisfactory service and successfully completed

the 1st Examination held for Co-operative Inspectors by the Co-operative College.

As submitted before this Court, the Co-operative Inspectors considered their service above the

Government Clerical Service or the Management Assistant Service that was introduced after Public

Administration Circular 06/2006 since the basic qualification was the four passes at the G.C.E.

(Advance Level) as against G.C.E. (Ordinary Level) for the Management Assistants. However Public

Administration Circular 06/2006 placed the Co-operative Inspectors salary at MN I-2006 scale,

whereas the Management Assistants were placed at MN 2 -2006 scale.

The Co-operative Inspectors were agitating against the said placement to the National Salaries and

Cadre Commission and by letter dated 04.01.2008, their recommendation was communicated to the

Secretary of the relevant Ministry by the said commission to place Co-operative Inspectors at MN 3-

2006.

As further submitted by the Petitioners, the subject of Co-operative being a devolved subject under

the 13th amendment to the Constitution, Provincial Co-operative Departments were functioning in

the provinces with the implementation of the 13th Amendment and the Petitioners belonging to the

Western Province Co-operative Department.

The Western Provincial Council had granted the MN I-2006 scale to the co-operative Inspectors in the

Western Province prior to the salary revision recommended by the National Salaries and Cadre

Commission and Placed Co-operative Inspectors in Class II-B at step-I, Class II-A at step 12 and Class I

at step 23.

15 According to the Petitioners, although the entry-level qualifications for Co-operative Inspectors were

G.C.E. (Advance Level) there were graduates serving as Co-operative Inspectors and at the time the

instant application was filed, there were about 85 graduates serving as Co-operative Inspectors in the

Department of Co-operative Development of the Western Province at different levels (i.e., Class II-B,

II-A, and I) including 37th, 38th, 42nd, 93rd to 102nd, 135th and 138th Petitioners.

The Petitioners were unaware of any decisions by the Western Provincial Council or by the National

Salaries and Cadre Commission to place a group of Co-operative Inspectors serving in the Western

Provincial Council at MN4-2006 from April 2008, but they were surprised when they got to know that

approximately 20 Co-operative Inspectors receiving a salary higher than the others for the month of

April 2008, which they have subsequently complained to this Court by the instant application.

As further submitted by the Petitioners, the said salary increase was granted ignoring the class under

which the recipient of the said increment was serving at that time but the only basis was that the

recipient was a graduate employed after 1977 and had served for 15 years or more as a Co-operative

Inspector. The said ad hoc increment granted to a small number of Co-operative Inspectors serving

in the Western Province had created a salary anomaly among the Co-operative Inspectors since even

a class I officer of the Co-operative Inspectors Service was entitled to an MN 3 salary.

The Petitioners when invoking the Jurisdiction of this Court had made the Chief Minister, the Board

of Ministers of the Western Provincial Council, the Governor, the Secretary to the Co-operative

Ministry- Western Province, and the Attorney General as Respondents. Among the Respondents, only

the 7th Respondent the Secretary to the Co-operative Ministry Western Province filed objections

before this Court justifying the decision impugned before this Court.

According to the 7th Respondent, graduate employment schemes were implemented as far back as

year 1971 and before, but their grievances were not looked into until 1994. For the first time, Public

Administration Circular 20/94 was issued in granting relief to certain categories of under-employed

graduates identified by the circular as rdcH fiajfha ,smsldr yd iudka;r fiajdjkays W!k fiajd

kshqla; WmdOdkag iyk ie,iSu iy 1971-1976 olajd ld,h ;=, WmdOd wNHdi fhdackd l%uh

hgf;a n|jd .kq ,enQ ks,Odkag iyk ie,iSu and as per the said circular (7R10) it was applicable

to,

a) graduates who joined the Public Service under the graduate training scheme between

1971-1976

16

b) graduates who joined prior to 1971 to positions allied to plan implementation officers

c) graduates who joined outsides the graduate training scheme between 1971-1977

d) graduates who joined under the graduate placement scheme subsequent to 1977 and

have completed 15 years of service in the Public Service

The next document the 7th Respondent relied upon in his objection was the Public Administration

Circular 20/94 (II) issued on 15.07.2005, (7R 11) extending the relief granted to under-employed

graduates in clerical and allied services who joined those services after 1977. The said circular was

applicable to those who joined clerical and allied serviced between 01.01.1978 and 31.12.1980 and

obtained the degree during this period or prior and served in the same capacity for 15 years as of

01.06.1994

Whilst referring to the above two circulars, the 7th Respondent had tried to explain that, even though

there is no specific reference that, those circulars are applicable to the Co-operative Inspectors

Service, those circulars apply to the Co-operative Inspectors service as well. In paragraph 16 of his

affidavit the 7th Respondent referred to the above as follows;

16. Answering the averments contained in paragraph 12 of the said petition I admit that

PA Circular 29/94 does not include Co-operative Inspectors as an allied service for the

clerical service. However, I state that until the circular No. 06/2006 the Co-operative

Inspectors were placed on the same salary scale as of the clerical and allied services.

Accordingly, they were considered employees of a similar category until circular No.

6/2006. Further, I state that circular No. 2/97 classified the public service according to

the salary scale, and accordingly, Co-operative Inspectors were also categorized among

others, along with the clerical service according to their salary scale Rs. 45,900-14x320-

6x 1,560-73,740 (salary Code T.2.1.-T.2.5) until the circular No. 6/2006 was

implemented. The preamble to circular No. 2/97 is annexed herewith marked 7R4.

However, the above position is contradicted by his own document which was produced by him

marked 7R 7(a). The above document is a memorandum submitted to the Provincial Board of

Ministers of the Western Province to obtain approval to extend the relief granted to the under-

employed graduates in clerical and allied service by Public Administration Circular 20/94 (original

Circular) to the Co-operative Inspectors with similar qualification.

In the said provincial memorandum, the reason to obtain special approval was explained as follows;

As revealed before us the provincial Board of Ministers has approved the said memorandum and the

Co-operative Inspectors who were eligible to come under the said decision were paid salaries

according to the Public Administration Circular 20/94, even though the Director Establishment had

taken a different view. However, there was no challenge to the implementation of the said decision

by the rest of the Co-operative Inspectors at that time.

With regard to the implementation of the second circular issued in the Year 2005 (Public

Administration Circular 20/94 (ii)), the 7th Respondent had taken up the position that Public

Administration Circular 20/94 (ii) was issued in the year 2005 expanding the coverage of the original

circular and the Governor of the Western Province, the 6th Respondent had approved the decision of

the Board of Ministers to place the Underemployed graduate Co-operative Inspectors those who

joined the service after 1977 and completed 15 years of service to be placed on a salary scale as

referred to in the circular.

Even though the 7th Respondent had taken up the above position in his affidavit filed before this Court,

he has failed to submit before this Court the decisions of the Board of Ministers and/or the Governor

Western Province as referred to above. However, the justification he submitted before this court was

twofold.

Firstly, he took up the position that it is correct to consider the graduate Co-operative Inspectors along

with clerical and allied services since the Co-operative Inspectors were also drawing a salary equal to

those grades and secondly, he justified the implementation of circular 20/94(ii) since the original

circular 20/94 too was implemented without any objection in the Western Province in order to give

effect to the state policy on resolving grievances of the underemployed graduates.

18 However, he was silent on the decision communicated to the provincial Co-operative Commissioner

by the Director Establishment ruling out that Graduate Co-operative Inspectors were not belonging

to clerical and allied services in order to get the benefit of the circular 20/94. In other words, the

state policy implemented by circular 20/94 was to give relief only to under-employed graduates in

clerical and allied services only and therefore those who do not belong to clerical and allied services

are not entitled to the same benefit.

The same officer who issued the 20/94 circular in the year 1994, namely the Secretary to the Ministry

of Public Administration had issued another circular subsequently bearing number 29/94, and in the

said circular the clerical and allied services were identified as follows;

The Co-operative Inspectors Service was not included in the said circular. The Petitioners whilst

referring to the above circular had taken up the position that the said interpretation was the result of

the long-standing grievance complained on behalf of the Co-operative Inspectors.

Even though it was argued on behalf of the 7th Respondent that both Public Administration Circulars

which provided relief to under-employed graduates in clerical and allied services had equally

applicable to the under-employed graduates in the Co-operative Inspectors Service, Public

Administrative Circular 29/1994 clearly leave out the Co-operative Inspectors from the clerical and

allied services and therefore a question will arise as to the applicability of those circulars to a group

of graduates outside the clerical and allied services.

As already observed in this judgment the wording of the two circulars (7R10 and 7 R 11) are very

specific and the circulars do not provide provisions in grating any relief to other groups except those

who are covered by the circulars.

19 As further observed by this Court the grievances and the anomalies complained by the Co-operative

Inspectors were resolved by the National Salaries and Cadre Commission and the said decision was

communicated by letter dated 04.01.2008 placing the Co-operative Inspectors at MN3-2006 scale. In

those circumstances treating the Graduate Co-operative Inspectors on par with the underemployed

Graduates in clerical and allied services and granting MN 4-2006 scale had created an anomaly in the

Co-operative Inspectors Service by giving a wrong interpretation to the state policy in granting relief

to underemployed graduates in clerical and allied services.

As already referred to by me the two circulars relied by the 7th Respondent are specific on their

applicability and Circular 20/94 (ii) specifically identified the graduates to whom the said circular is

applicable.

For clarity, I would like to once again refer to the second paragraph of the circular which clearly

identifies the applicable groups as,

2. 1978.01.01. osk yd 1980.12.31. osk w;r ld,mfoh ;=, ,smslre yd iudka;r fiajd j,g

The two highlighted areas in the said paragraph require the graduate to obtain the degree either

before or during the period relevant to the circular and should work for 15 years after obtaining the

degree. If the degree was obtained in 1978, he needs to wait until 01.06.1994 and in those

circumstances, the graduate will have to wait nearly 16 years to become eligible under the said

circular.

A group of Graduate Co-operative Inspectors sought intervention in the instant application and as

already referred to by me, the Petitioners did not object to the intervention, and the Intervenient

Petitioners were added as 16th -32nd added Respondents. The papers that were filed by the

Intervenient Petitioners before this Court includes the details of the Intervenient Petitioners and

according to them, they were among the recipients who received the salary increment that was

challenged before this Court. The details provided by the Intervenient Petitioners Respondents can

be summarized as follows;

Out of the seventeen Intervenient Petitioners Respondents, only two had joined the Co-operative

Inspectors Service (26th and 29th Respondents) between 01.01.1978 and 31.12.1980. But they were

not degree holders at the time they joined the service. 26th had obtained the degree seven years after

he joined the service and the 29th after five years. However as already observed above the under-

employed graduates should possess the degree within the period referred to in the circular and the

21 above Respondents does not come within the circular even if the circular is applicable to Co- operative

Inspectors Service.

All the other Respondents had joined the Co-operative Inspector Service between 1981 and 1988 and

except for six Respondents (17th, 19th, 25th, 28th, 31st, and 32nd), others were not degree holders at the

time they joined the service. 21st Respondent had obtained the degree in 2001, 19 years after joining

the service, and had completed only 07 years of service after obtaining the degree when he was given

the salary increment. The 18th and 22nd Respondents were not degree holders but were holding

diplomas obtained from Galle and Kandy Technical Colleges and there is no material to show that the

Diplomas they possess are equal to a degree.

Even if the argument made on behalf of the 7th Respondent that 1994/20 (ii) circular is applicable to

the under-employed Co-operative Inspectors who complete 15 years serving; as identified in the

circular the 15 years period will only be applicable after obtaining the degree, and the officer should

complete 15 years of service by 31.12.1995. In those circumstances, a further question arises as to

the applicability of the said circular to the Intervenient Petitioners Respondents.

When considering the above matters, it is clear that no proper scheme was followed when granting

the increments to a group of Co-operative Inspectors and the seventh Respondent had failed to

produce before the Supreme Court the decision taken by the Board of Ministers of the Western

Provincial Council or the directive said to have been signed by the 6th Respondent, Governor, Western

Province.

In the absence of a specific decision, the 7th Respondent had heavily relied on the board paper and

the decision by the Board of Ministers in implementing the provisions of the main circular, 20/1994

in favour of the Co-operative Inspectors Service in the year 1998 but as already referred to in this

Judgment, the said decision was contrary to the state policy on granting relief to the under Employed

Graduates in clerical and allied services.

The failure of the North-Western Provincial Public Service Commission to give effect to the National

Teachers Transfer Policy identified in Circular 95/11 issued by the Ministry of Education and Higher

Education was complained about in the case of Kamalawathy V. Provincial Public Service

Commission of the North -Western Province [2001] 1 Sri LR 1 at 5 Mark Fernando (J) held, while

powers in respect of education have been devolved to Provincial Councils, those powers must be

22 exercised in conformity with national policy. Once national policy has been duly formulated in respect

of any subject there cannot be any conflicting provincial policy on the same subject.

When considering the material already discussed in this judgment, I hold that the Petitioners before

this Court were successful in establishing the violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed under

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. Neither the Petitioners nor the 7th Respondent who filed an affidavit

before this Court had been able to produce the impugned decision but it is admitted that a small

group of Co-operative Inspectors belonging to the Western Provincial Council were placed at a higher

salary scale based on a decision said to have taken by the Board of Ministers of the Western Provincial

Council and approved by the Governor, which is implemented by the 7th and 8th Respondents.

In the said circumstances, I hold that the 1st to the 7th Respondents and the 8th Respondent have acted

in violation of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

We further direct the said Respondents or their successors to take necessary steps to alleviate the

effects caused to the Petitioners by the impugned decision arrived in violation of the fundamental

rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.
