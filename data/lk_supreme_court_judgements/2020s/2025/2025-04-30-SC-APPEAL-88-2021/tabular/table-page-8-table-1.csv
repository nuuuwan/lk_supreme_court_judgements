"12.  The Appellant has sought to contend that Rule 3(1)(b) is distinct from Rule 3(1)(a) and"
"that, as a revision application, the former applies independently. The Appellant argues"
"that  Rule  3(1)(b)  merely  requires  “copies  of  the  relevant  proceedings”  and  does  not"
"explicitly  mandate  “duly  certified  copies”  as  stated  in  Rule  3(1)(a).  The  Appellant’s"
"reasoning is that, therefore, non-certified copies should suffice for compliance with the"
"Appellant Procedure Rules."
