"","of Rules 3(1) (a) and 3(1)(b) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules.”"
"17.  A perusal of the impugned Court of Appeal judgment dated 25th January 2018 confirms",""
"","that the learned Court of Appeal Judge adopted the same view. His Lordship Surasena,"
"","J.  (as  he  was  then)  held  that  the  Appellant’s  failure  to  annex  a  certified  copy  of  the"
"","impugned  proceedings  left  the  Court  with  no  material  upon  which  to  consider  the"
"","application. Furthermore, in the absence of a legitimate justification excusing the failure"
"","to  furnish  certified  copies  in  accordance  with  Rule  3(1)(a),  the  Court  ruled  that  the"
"","application must be dismissed."
"18.","I see no reason to depart from the reasoning set out above. Adherence to the rules of"
"","appellate courts, particularly the duty of a petitioner to tender certified copies, is essential"
"","to  ensuring  both 
the  authenticity  of  documents  and 
the 
responsibility 
for  such"
"","authenticity."
"19.","In  the  written  submission  of  the  Respondent  dated  29th  March  2022,  an  attempt  was"
"","made to establish a discrepancy between the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal"
"","and the case of Attorney General v Ranjith Weerawickrama,7 which, the Respondent"
"","pointed out, was also delivered by His Lordship Surasena, J. in the Court of Appeal a few"
"","months 
prior 
to 
the 
impugned 
judgment. 
In  Attorney  General 
v 
Ranjith"
