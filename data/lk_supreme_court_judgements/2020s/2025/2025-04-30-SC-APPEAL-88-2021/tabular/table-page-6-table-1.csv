"5.","The Appellant subsequently invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, seeking, inter alia, to"
"","set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the preceding order of the High Court"
"","of Colombo. Notably, rather than filing a singular appeal, the Appellant submitted no"
"","fewer than four separate petitions to this Court. The first such petition, dated 2nd March"
"","2018, was filed along with an affidavit and was assigned Case No. SC/SPL/Leave to Appeal"
"","No.  37/2018.  However,  by  order  dated  05th  April  2018,  this  Court  dismissed  the"
"","application  due  to  the  non-appearance  of  either  the  Appellant  or  his  Counsel  at  the"
"","hearing."
"6.","As per journal entry  dated 16th May 2018, the Appellant filed motion dated 27th April"
"","2018, explaining, in my view, rather unconvincingly, that the want of appearance when"
"","the  first  petition  was  taken  up  before  this  Court  was  ascribed  to  the  Counsel  being"
"","present in the wrong Court. The listing judge, therefore, directed the Appellant to file a"
"","proper application to the Court."
"7.","In compliance with this directive, the Appellant filed a subsequent petition and affidavit"
"","by motion dated 24th June 2018. However, when the matter was taken up on 04th July"
"","2018, the petition was found to be defective. By order dated 24th June 2018, this Court"
"","dismissed the application, having observed, inter alia, that the petition was undated and,"
"","critically, lacked a prayer— an essential component without which a petition cannot be"
"","entertained.  In  dismissing  the  application,  the  Court,  displaying  remarkable  latitude,"
"","granted the Appellant yet another opportunity to file a fresh petition."
"8.","Subsequently, the Appellant filed a third petition and affidavit dated 6th August 2018."
"","However,  at  the  hearing  on  18th  September  2018,  this  Court  once  again  identified"
"","fundamental deficiencies. Specifically, the petition failed to annex certified copies of the"
"","journal entries and the Supreme Court case record, documents essential to the proper"
"","constitution of the application. Perhaps as a testament only to this Court’s generosity"
