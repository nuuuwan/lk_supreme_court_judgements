"25. In Supramanium v. Symons,9 Wood Renton CJ stated,"
"“People may do what they like with their disputes as long as they do not invoke the"
"assistance  of  the  Courts  of  Law.  But  whenever  that  step  has  been  taken  they  are"
"bound to proceed with all possible and reasonable expedition, and it is the duty of"
"their legal advisors and of the Courts themselves to seek that this is done. The work"
"of the Courts must be conducted on ordinary business principles, and no Judges is"
"obliged,  or  is  entitled  to  allow  the  accumulation  upon  is  cause  list  of  a  mass  of"
"inanimate or semi animate actions.”"
