"on two questions of law:"
"(a) Did  the  High  Court  err  in  law  in  holding  that  the  plaintiffs  have"
"failed to prove title and identity of the corpus when the defendants"
"in their answer as well as admissions specifically admitted title and"
"identity of the land in dispute?"
"(b) In  any  event,  was  there  sufficient  evidence  to  prove  the  contrary"
"position taken up by the defendants where none of the defendants"
"gave evidence of the use of the roadway?"
