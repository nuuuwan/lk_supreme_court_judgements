"14   
SC/APPEAL/5/2021"
"no  waiver  of  objection  or  acquiescence  can  cure 
the  want  of"
"jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to permit parties by their"
"conduct to confer jurisdiction on a tribunal which has none would be"
"to admit a power in the parties to litigation to create new jurisdictions"
"or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits, both of which"
"are within the exclusive privilege of the legislature; the proceedings"
"in cases within this category are non coram judice and the want of"
"jurisdiction is incurable. In the other class of case, where the want"
"of jurisdiction is contingent only, the judgment or order of the Court"
"will  be  void  only  against 
the  party  on  whom 
it  operates  but"
"acquiescence,  waiver  or  inaction  on  the  part  of  such  person  may"
"estop him from making or attempting to establish by evidence, any"
"averment  to  the  effect  that  the  Court  was  lacking  in  contingent"
"jurisdiction."
