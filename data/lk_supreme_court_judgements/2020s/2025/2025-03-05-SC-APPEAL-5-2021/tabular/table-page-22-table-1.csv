"the words differently on the basis that the literal interpretation does not"
"reflect  the  real  intention  of  Parliament.  If  the  wording  of  a  charging"
"provision is ambiguous, permitting one interpretation favourable to the"
"taxpayer  and  another  to  the  tax  collector,  the  Court  should  adopt  the"
"interpretation that favours the taxpayer until such ambiguity is resolved"
"by 
legislative  amendment.  Conversely,  when 
interpreting  machinery"
"provisions,  a  more  liberal  approach  is  warranted  to  give  effect  to  the"
"legislative 
intent.  Machinery  provisions  are  not 
subject 
to 
strict"
"construction where such interpretation would defeat the purpose of the"
"statute. 
If 
the 
language  of  a  machinery  provision 
is  ambiguous,"
"permitting  one 
interpretation 
favouring 
the 
taxpayer  and  another"
"favouring  the  tax  collector,  the  Court  should  adopt  the  interpretation"
"favouring  the  tax  collector  until  the  legislature  resolves  the  ambiguity"
"through an amendment."
