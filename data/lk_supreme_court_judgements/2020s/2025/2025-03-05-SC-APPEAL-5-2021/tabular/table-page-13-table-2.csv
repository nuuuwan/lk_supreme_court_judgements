"Tennekoon C.J. articulated this principle in the following manner:",""
"","Lack  of  competency  in  a  Court  is  a  circumstance  that  results  in  a"
"","judgment or order that is void. Lack of competency may arise in one"
"","of two ways. A Court may lack jurisdiction over the cause or matter"
"","or over the parties; it may also lack competence because of failure to"
"","comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the"
"","exercise of power by the Court. Both are jurisdictional defects; the"
"","first mentioned of these is commonly known in the law as a ‘patent’"
"","or  ‘total’  want  of  jurisdiction  or  a  defectus  jurisdictionis  and  the"
"","second  a  ‘latent’  or  ‘contingent’  want  of  jurisdiction  or  a  defectus"
"","triationis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or"
"","orders  which  are  void.  But  an  important  difference  must  also  be"
"","noted. In that class of case where the want of jurisdiction is patent,"
