"nominated him to exercise the jurisdiction of the High Court in terms"
"of the Arbitration Act, No. 11 of 1995."
"In the circumstances the Judge who made the impugned order and"
"the Court in which he presided was amply seized with jurisdiction"
"to  hear  and  determine  the  application  for  the  enforcement  of  the"
"arbitral  award.  The  proceedings  of  14.11.1997  referred  to  above"

this 
jurisdiction  being  described  as 
the  “Commercial"
"Court”. The appendage “Commercial” should be taken merely as a"
"reference to the administrative arrangements referred above and no"
"more. The Petitioner was in error when he described the Court in the"

"above. However, immediately beneath that description the Petitioner"
"has recited that the application is being made in terms of Parts 7 and"
