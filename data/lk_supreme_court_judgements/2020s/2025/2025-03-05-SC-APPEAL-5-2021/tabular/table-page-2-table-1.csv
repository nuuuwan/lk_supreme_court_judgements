"The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue filed a certificate of tax in"
"default  dated  30.06.2016  in  the  District  Court  of  Colombo  seeking  to"
"recover a sum of Rs. 53,632,639 from the appellant under section 43(1)"
"of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002."
"Upon  service  of  summons,  the  appellant  taxpayer  took  up  three  main"

learned"
"Additional  District  Judge  of  Colombo  by  order  dated  06.09.2018"
"overruled them and decided to recover the aforesaid tax in default as a"
"fine. He also imposed a six-month term of imprisonment in the event of"
"default in payment and granted a date to pay the fine."
"The  revision  application  filed  against  this  order  was  dismissed  by  the"
"High Court of Civil Appeal of Colombo by judgment dated 16.07.2020."
"This  appeal  with  leave  obtained  is  against  the  judgment  of  the  High"
"Court.  In  essence,  the  question  of  law  on  which  leave  to  appeal  was"
"granted  by  this  Court  is  whether  the  District  Court  of  Colombo  lacked"
"jurisdiction to entertain and decide on an application filed under section"
"43(1) of the VAT Act, which explicitly confers such jurisdiction upon the"
"Magistrateâ€™s Court."
"Provisions  similar  to  section  43(1)  of  the  VAT  Act  are  found  in  several"
"other  tax  statutes.  The  same  argument  has  been  repeatedly  taken  up"
"since at least 1986, when it was addressed and answered in the negative"
"in Y.C. Costa v. Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1986) Vol. IV,"
"Reports of Sri Lanka Tax Cases 268. Despite being raised continuously"
