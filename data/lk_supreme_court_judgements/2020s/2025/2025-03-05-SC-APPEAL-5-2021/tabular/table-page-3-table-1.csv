"for nearly 40 years, I have not come across a single judgment where this"
"issue has been answered in the affirmative. All the Courts have answered"
"the  question  in  the  negative,  ruling  in  favour  of  the  Commissioner"
"General  of  Inland  Revenue.  To  bring  finality  to  this  issue,  the  Chief"
"Justice appointed a Divisional Bench to hear this appeal."
"The  argument  advanced  by  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  can  be"
"summarised as follows: The recovery of tax in default is mainly governed"
"by  two  distinct  regimes—one  through  the  District  Court  and  the  other"
"through the Magistrate’s Court. If the  Commissioner General of Inland"
"Revenue decides to recover tax in default through the District Court, the"
"District Judge is empowered to make only those orders authorised under"
"the relevant statute (in this instance, section 42(6) of the VAT Act) and"
"cannot exercise powers that are exclusively reserved for a Magistrate (in"
"this instance, section 43(1) of the VAT Act). The Commissioner General"
"could  not  have  filed  the  certificate  under  section  43(1)  of  the  VAT  Act"
"before  the  District  Court,  and  the  Additional  District  Judge  lacked  the"
"jurisdiction  to  make  orders  to  recover  the  tax  in  default  as  a  fine.  The"
"jurisdiction  to  recover  the  tax  in  default  as  a  fine  is  vested only  in  the"
"Magistrate’s Court."
"The Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, was the predecessor"
"to the Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978. As evidenced by sections 25 to 27"
"of  the  Administration  of  Justice  Law,  at  that  time,  District  Courts"
"exercised  both  civil  and  criminal 
jurisdiction  and  had  concurrent"
"jurisdiction  with  Magistrates’  Courts.  The  revenue  jurisdiction  of  the"
"District Court was separately recognised by section 28."
"Concurrent 
25. Every District Judge shall have concurrent jurisdiction"
"jurisdiction.  
with every Magistrate of divisions situated within the limits"
