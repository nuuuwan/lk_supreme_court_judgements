"procedure would have been under section 65. Sansoni J. (as he then was)"
"stated at page 458:"
"It  is  well-settled  that  an  exercise  of  a  power  will  be  referable  to  a"
"jurisdiction  which confers validity upon  it  and not  to  a jurisdiction"
"under which it will be nugatory. This principle has been applied even"
"to cases where a Statute which confers no power has been quoted"
"as  authority  for  a  particular  act,  and  there  was  in  force  another"
"Statute which conferred that power."
