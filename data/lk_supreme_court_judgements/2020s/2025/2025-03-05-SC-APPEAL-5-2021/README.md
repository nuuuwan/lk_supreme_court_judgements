Samayawardhena, J.

The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue filed a certificate of tax in

default dated 30.06.2016 in the District Court of Colombo seeking to

recover a sum of Rs. 53,632,639 from the appellant under section 43(1)

of the Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002.

Upon service of summons, the appellant taxpayer took up three main

objections to the maintainability of the application but the learned

Additional District Judge of Colombo by order dated 06.09.2018

overruled them and decided to recover the aforesaid tax in default as a

fine. He also imposed a six-month term of imprisonment in the event of

default in payment and granted a date to pay the fine.

The revision application filed against this order was dismissed by the

High Court of Civil Appeal of Colombo by judgment dated 16.07.2020.

This appeal with leave obtained is against the judgment of the High

Court. In essence, the question of law on which leave to appeal was

granted by this Court is whether the District Court of Colombo lacked

jurisdiction to entertain and decide on an application filed under section

43(1) of the VAT Act, which explicitly confers such jurisdiction upon the

Magistrates Court.

Provisions similar to section 43(1) of the VAT Act are found in several

other tax statutes. The same argument has been repeatedly taken up

since at least 1986, when it was addressed and answered in the negative

in Y.C. Costa v. Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1986) Vol. IV,

Reports of Sri Lanka Tax Cases 268. Despite being raised continuously

3

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

for nearly 40 years, I have not come across a single judgment where this

issue has been answered in the affirmative. All the Courts have answered

the question in the negative, ruling in favour of the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue. To bring finality to this issue, the Chief

Justice appointed a Divisional Bench to hear this appeal.

The argument advanced by learned counsel for the appellant can be

summarised as follows: The recovery of tax in default is mainly governed

by two distinct regimesone through the District Court and the other

through the Magistrates Court. If the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue decides to recover tax in default through the District Court, the

District Judge is empowered to make only those orders authorised under

the relevant statute (in this instance, section 42(6) of the VAT Act) and

cannot exercise powers that are exclusively reserved for a Magistrate (in

this instance, section 43(1) of the VAT Act). The Commissioner General

could not have filed the certificate under section 43(1) of the VAT Act

before the District Court, and the Additional District Judge lacked the

jurisdiction to make orders to recover the tax in default as a fine. The

jurisdiction to recover the tax in default as a fine is vested only in the

Magistrates Court.

The Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, was the predecessor

to the Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978. As evidenced by sections 25 to 27

of the Administration of Justice Law, at that time, District Courts

exercised both civil and criminal jurisdiction and had concurrent

jurisdiction with Magistrates Courts. The revenue jurisdiction of the

District Court was separately recognised by section 28.

Concurrent

jurisdiction.

25. Every District Judge shall have concurrent jurisdiction

with every Magistrate of divisions situated within the limits

of the district for which the District Court is constituted.

4

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

Civil

jurisdiction.

26. A District Court shall within its district have original

jurisdiction in all civil, revenue, matrimonial, insolvency

and testamentary matters, except such of the aforesaid

matters as are by this or any other written law exclusively

assigned by way of original jurisdiction to any other court

or vested in any other authority, and shall, in like manner,

also have jurisdiction over the persons and estates of

persons of unsound mind, minors, and wards, over the

estates of cestuis que trust, and over guardians and

trustees, and in any other matter in which jurisdiction may

hereafter be given to District Courts by law.

Criminal

jurisdiction.

27. (1) A District Court shall have jurisdiction and is hereby

required to hear, try, and determine in the manner provided

for by written law, all prosecutions upon indictment

instituted therein against any person in respect of any

offence committed wholly or in part within its district.

(2) A District Court may impose any of the following

sentences:-

(a) imprisonment for a term not exceeding five

years;

(b) fine not exceeding five thousand rupees;

(c) whipping;

(d) any lawful sentence combining any two of the

sentences aforesaid.

5

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

(3) In every case of a continuing offence in respect of which

a District Court may exercise jurisdiction, it shall also have

the power and authority to remove or abate the act, matter,

or thing complained of.

Revenue

Jurisdiction

28. A District Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain

causes affecting the revenue, and to inquire into all offences

against the revenue laws of Sri Lanka committed wholly or

in part within its district and to hear, try, and determine all

actions and prosecutions commenced by the State against

any person in respect of any such offences, and to impose

the fines, penalties and forfeitures appertaining to such

offences, although the same may exceed the sum which

such court is authorized to impose in the exercise of its

ordinary criminal jurisdiction.

Similarly, in terms of sections 29 to 31 of the Administration of Justice

Law, the Magistrates Courts also exercised both criminal and civil

jurisdiction.

Chapter 1 of the Administration of Justice Law which contained the above

sections was repealed by section 62 of the Judicature Act. Under the

Judicature Act now in force, the District Courts no longer exercise

criminal jurisdiction, and vice versa, the Magistrates Courts do not

exercise civil jurisdiction. Accordingly, under the Judicature Act, unlike

under the Administration of Justice Law, District Judges do not exercise

concurrent jurisdiction with Magistrates of divisions situated within the

limits of the district for which the District Court is constituted.

Section 19 of the Judicature Act reads as follows:

6

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

Every District Court shall be a court of record and shall within its

district have unlimited original jurisdiction in all civil, revenue, trust,

insolvency and testamentary matters, save and except such of the

aforesaid matters as are by or under Chapter VA of this Act or by

virtue of the provisions of any other enactment exclusively assigned

by way of original jurisdiction to any other court or vested in any

other authority and in the exercise of such jurisdiction to impose

fines, penalties and forfeitures and shall, in like manner also have

jurisdiction over the persons and estates of persons of unsound mind

and wards, over the estates of cestuis que trust; and over guardians

and trustees and in any other matter in which jurisdiction is given

to District Court by law.

In reference to this section, learned Deputy Solicitor General submits

that Insofar as revenue matters are concerned, the jurisdiction of the

District Court is unlimited and there is no necessity for any specific power

to be conferred upon the District Court by any existing law to give effect to

any provision in such law relating to revenue matters. I am unable to

agree. According to section 19 of the Judicature Act, every District Court

shall, inter alia, have unlimited original jurisdiction in all revenue

matters, except where original jurisdiction has been exclusively assigned

to any other Court or authority by any written law.

In terms of section 43(1) of the VAT Act, the original jurisdiction of the

recovery of tax in default as a fine is vested in the Magistrates Court

within the jurisdiction of which the defaulter resides or his place of

business is situate.

Where the Commissioner-General is of opinion in any case that

recovery of tax in default by seizure and sale is impracticable, or

inexpedient or where the full amount of the tax in default has not

been recovered, he may issue a certificate containing particulars of

7

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

such tax and the name and last known place of business or

residence of the defaulter, to a Magistrate having jurisdiction in the

division in which such place of business or residence of the defaulter

is situate. The Magistrate shall thereupon summon such defaulter

before him to show cause why further proceedings for the recovery

of the tax should not be taken against him, and in default of

sufficient cause being shown, the tax in default shall be deemed to

be a fine imposed by a sentence of the Magistrate on such defaulter

for an offence punishable with fine only or not punishable with

imprisonment and the provisions of subsection (1) of section 291

(except paragraphs (a), (d) and (i) thereof) the Code of Criminal

Procedure No 15 of 1979, relating to default of payment of a fine

imposed for such an offence shall thereupon apply, and the

Magistrate may make any direction which, by the provisions of that

subsection, he could have made at the time of imposing such

sentence:

Provided that nothing in this section shall authorize or require the

Magistrate in any proceeding thereunder to consider, examine or

decide the correctness of any statement in the certificate of the

Commissioner-General or to postpone or defer such proceeding for a

period exceeding thirty days, by reason only of the fact that an

appeal is pending against the assessment in respect of which the

tax in default is charged.

If the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue intends to recover the tax

in default through the seizure and sale of the property of the defaulter,

as opposed to recovery as a fine, the original jurisdiction, in terms of

section 42(6) of the VAT Act, is vested in the District Court where the

property of the defaulter is situate.

Section 60 of the Judicature Act read with section 61 empowers the

Minister of Justice, with the concurrence of the Chief Justice, to make

regulations designating any Court or Courts in Sri Lanka to hear and

determine specified categories of cases or other matters. These

regulations shall be published in the Gazette and presented to Parliament

for approval.

The regulations made by the Minister under section 61 read with section

60 of the Judicature Act were published in the Government Gazette

According to section 3 of the Judicature Act, for the purpose of the

administration of justice, Sri Lanka shall be divided into judicial zones

(High Court jurisdiction), judicial districts (District Court jurisdiction)

and judicial divisions (Magistrates Court jurisdiction) within such

territorial limits as may in consultation with the Chief Justice and the

President of the Court of Appeal from time to time be determined by the

Minister by Order published in the Gazette.

The territorial jurisdiction of the District Court of Colombo extends to the

judicial district of Colombo, while the territorial jurisdiction of the

Magistrates Court of Colombo extends to the judicial division of Colombo.

Through Gazette No. 1380/17 of 16.02.2005, the Minister extended only

the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court of Colombo to cover all

judicial districts of Sri Lanka in respect of matters falling under the Acts

specified therein including the VAT Act. Similarly, the Minister extended

only the territorial jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court of Colombo to

cover all judicial divisions of Sri Lanka in respect of matters falling under

the Acts specified therein including the VAT Act.

There is a difference between territorial jurisdiction and subject matter

jurisdiction. Apart from expanding the territorial jurisdiction, the

Minister did not, and could not, confer new subject matter jurisdiction

on the District Court of Colombo by this Gazette. To be more specific, the

Minister did not, and could not, confer jurisdiction over matters falling

within the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court to the District Court and

12

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

vice versa. This is the function of the legislature, of which the Minister is

a member, but not the sole decision-maker.

In terms of the first proviso to section 60 of the Judicature Act, the

expansion of the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court of Colombo

and the Magistrates Court of Colombo in that manner does not affect the

relevant Court, which ordinarily has territorial jurisdiction, exercising

concurrent jurisdiction over such matters.

This legal position was accepted by the learned High Court Judge in the

impugned judgment when he stated:

It is correct to argue that the purpose of this regulation is to give the

Magistrate of Colombo the power to determine matters under section

43(1) of the Value Added Tax Act and the District Judge of Colombo

to determine matters under section 42(6) of the same Act

respectively, and therefore, a District Judge has no power to

determine an action instituted under section 43(1).

In accordance with the foregoing analysis, the correct legal position is

that the District Court cannot recover the tax in default as a fine under

section 43 of the VAT Act as that jurisdiction is exclusively vested in the

Magistrates Court. If such an order is made by the District Court, it is

ultra vires. If a decision is ultra vires, it is a nullity for all intents and

purposes; it is void, not voidable. In Anthony Naide v. The Ceylon Tea

Plantation Co. Ltd. of London (1966) 68 NLR 558 at 560, Sansoni C.J.

stated It is clear law that a judgment given without jurisdiction is a nullity,

for judicial power is capable of being exercised by a court only when it is a

court of competent jurisdiction, and that means competent under some

law.

There is a distinction between an act without jurisdiction and an error

within jurisdiction. The non-existence of jurisdiction (patent lack of

13

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

jurisdiction) and the irregular exercise of jurisdiction (latent lack of

jurisdiction) are distinct concepts.

The issue at hand constitutes a patent lack of jurisdiction, which is fatal

and can be raised at any stage of the proceedings, including for the first

time on appeal. No amount of acquiescence, waiver or inaction will cure

such defect, as parties cannot expressly or impliedly confer jurisdiction

on a Court where none exists.

Conversely, if the lack of jurisdiction is latent, such as an objection to

territorial jurisdiction or to procedure, the objection must be raised at the

earliest possible opportunity. In such situations, the Court undoubtedly

has plenary jurisdiction to deal with the matter but has not invoked it in

the proper way. A party cannot raise such an objection belatedly, once

he finds that the decision is unfavourable to him.

In the oft-quoted case of Beatrice Perera v. The Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue of National Housing (1974) 77 NLR 361 at 366,

Tennekoon C.J. articulated this principle in the following manner:

Lack of competency in a Court is a circumstance that results in a

judgment or order that is void. Lack of competency may arise in one

of two ways. A Court may lack jurisdiction over the cause or matter

or over the parties; it may also lack competence because of failure to

comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the

exercise of power by the Court. Both are jurisdictional defects; the

first mentioned of these is commonly known in the law as a patent

or total want of jurisdiction or a defectus jurisdictionis and the

second a latent or contingent want of jurisdiction or a defectus

triationis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or

orders which are void. But an important difference must also be

noted. In that class of case where the want of jurisdiction is patent,

14

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

no waiver of objection or acquiescence can cure the want of

jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to permit parties by their

conduct to confer jurisdiction on a tribunal which has none would be

to admit a power in the parties to litigation to create new jurisdictions

or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits, both of which

are within the exclusive privilege of the legislature; the proceedings

in cases within this category are non coram judice and the want of

jurisdiction is incurable. In the other class of case, where the want

of jurisdiction is contingent only, the judgment or order of the Court

will be void only against the party on whom it operates but

acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of such person may

estop him from making or attempting to establish by evidence, any

averment to the effect that the Court was lacking in contingent

jurisdiction.

This brings me to consider the second part of the High Court judgment.

While the learned High Court Judge held that the District Judge lacked

jurisdiction to recover the tax in default under section 43(1) of the VAT

Act as a fine, he nonetheless declined to allow the revision application of

the taxpayer on the basis that:

However, it has to be noted that all the District Judges appointed for

a particular judicial zone are also Additional Magistrates to that area

and, vice versa, all the Magistrates are Additional District Judges by

their appointment. In view of the above, since the certificate has been

issued under section 43(1) of the Value Added Tax Act, and

addressed to Magistrate/District Judge of Colombo, it is my

considered view that the Additional District Judge was correct when

he determined that he has the jurisdiction, although he has failed to

address more elaborately as to the basis of his jurisdiction in the

order.

15

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

Although the learned High Court Judge arrived at that finding, it is

important to note that the Additional District Judge did not order the

recovery of the tax in default as a fine on that basis. In the impugned

order, the Additional District Judge identifies three objections raised on

behalf of the taxpayer. The second objection relates to tax exemption and

the third objection relates to prescription. The first, which is directly

relevant to the issue at hand, reads as follows:

43(1)

.

The Additional District Judge rejects this objection on the following basis:

1978 02 2005 16

1380/17

.

,

43(1)

.

291

06 .

It is abundantly clear that the Additional District Judge held that he had

jurisdiction to recover the tax in default as a fine on the sole basis that

the District Court of Colombo was conferred with jurisdiction to entertain

applications under section 43(1) of the VAT Act by Gazette No. 1380/17

of 16.02.2005. He signed the impugned order as the Additional District

Judge of Colombo and never assumed the jurisdiction of a Magistrate at

16

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

any stage of the case. Hence, the justification of the learned High Court

Judge on this point cannot be accepted.

If a certificate of tax in default, which, according to the statute, should

be filed in the Magistrates Court, is instead filed in the District Court

and entertained by the District Judge on the basis that he also serves as

an Additional Magistrate, it would inevitably result in serious confusion

as to territorial and subject matter jurisdiction. This would potentially

lead to lawyers filing civil actions in the Magistrates Court and criminal

actions in the District Court, arguing that Additional District Judges are

also Additional Magistrates and vice versa. Furthermore, it would enable

lawyers to institute actions in any District Court or Magistrates Court

within the Judicial District, thereby encouraging forum shopping or

judge shopping to select judges they perceive as favourable.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General heavily relied on Vanik Incorporation

Ltd v. L.D. Silva [2001] 1 Sri LR 110 in defending the judgment of the

High Court on this point. In Vaniks case, an application for the

enforcement of an arbitral award was filed in the Western Province

Commercial High Court in Colombo. Upon objection being taken, the

Judge of the Commercial High Court declined to entertain the application

stating that the invocation of its jurisdiction was a nullity since, under

the Arbitration Act, a Judge of the High Court of Sri Lanka holden in the

judicial zone in Colombo is the appropriate Judge to entertain such an

application. This reasoning, however, was rejected by S.N. Silva C.J., who

observed at pages 115116:

The Judge who made the impugned order has at all material times

been a Judge of the High Court of Sri Lanka holding Court under the

territorial limits of the Judicial Zone of Colombo. In addition to that

the records show that on 10.10.1996 the Chief Justice has

17

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

nominated him to exercise the jurisdiction of the High Court in terms

of the Arbitration Act, No. 11 of 1995.

In the circumstances the Judge who made the impugned order and

the Court in which he presided was amply seized with jurisdiction

to hear and determine the application for the enforcement of the

arbitral award. The proceedings of 14.11.1997 referred to above

have been taken on a clear assumption of jurisdiction. The Judge

appears to have swayed to the contrary view by the description of

the Court in the caption as the Commercial High Court. This leads

me to advert to the last description of the High Court mentioned at

the commencement of the Judgment. The High Court of the Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act, No. 10 of 1996 was enacted to empower the

Provincial High Court to exercise jurisdiction in respect of certain civil

matters. The First Schedule to the Act specifies that such jurisdiction

shall be exercised in relation to actions where the cause of action

has arisen out of commercial transactions. The Minister has in terms

of section 2(1) of the Act appointed the High Court of the Western

Province and in terms of section 2(2)(a) the High Court of the Western

Province sitting at Colombo will exercise that jurisdiction. For

administrative convenience one of the Judges of the High Court of

the Western Province sitting at Colombo is specially designated for

this purpose and for similar reasons there is a separate Registry.

These administrative arrangements have resulted in the Court

exercising this jurisdiction being described as the Commercial

Court. The appendage Commercial should be taken merely as a

reference to the administrative arrangements referred above and no

more. The Petitioner was in error when he described the Court in the

caption as Western Province Commercial High Court as noted

above. However, immediately beneath that description the Petitioner

has recited that the application is being made in terms of Parts 7 and

18

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

8 of the Arbitration Act, No. 11 of 1995. Therefore in my view there

is a proper invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court. There was

certainly no basis to consider the application to be a nullity as stated

in the impugned order. The proper course of action would have been

for the Judge, who is vested with jurisdiction, to direct an

amendment of the caption to bring it in line with the recital that

appears beneath the name of the Court.

The issue in Vaniks case and the instant case are incomparable. In

Vaniks case, unlike in the instant case, the High Court before which the

application for the enforcement of the arbitration award was made had

jurisdiction to entertain the application, except for the incorrect

description of the name of the High Court in the caption of the

application. The Supreme Court held that there was no lack of

jurisdiction. In contrast, in the instant case, there was a clear lack of

jurisdiction on the part of the District Court to recover the tax as a fine

under the certificate of tax in default filed before it.

In Jayaseeli v. Dayawathi (SC/APPEAL/29/2016, SC Minutes of

28.02.2019), the revision application filed against an order of the District

Court of Homagama in the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal in

Colombo was refused on the ground that the District Court of Homagama

falls within the High Court Zone of Avissawella, and thus the application

should have been filed in the High Court of Civil Appeal in Avissawella.

The Supreme Court, however, set aside this decision, stating that the

High Court of Civil Appeal in Colombo, established under section 5A(1)

of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990,

has jurisdiction to hear appeals from judgments of the District Court of

Homagama, as it is situated within the Western Province. Although this

interpretation is technically correct, I must hasten to add that the

attention of that Bench had not been drawn to: (a) the grave danger of

19

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

this interpretation being misused for judge shopping or forum

shopping to select favourable judges, which must be stopped at any cost;

(b) the fact that appointment letters issued by the Chief Justice do not

authorise a High Court Judge to exercise criminal and civil jurisdiction

throughout the Province; (c) the inconvenience such a liberal

interpretation causes to certain parties to the action due to the distance

they have to travel; and (d) the administrative issues arising from such

an interpretation, including the unequal distribution of cases among

High Courts in the Province. As this decision is already being misused by

some Attorneys, the broad interpretation suggested in Jayaseeli v.

Dayawathi need not be followed.

This, however, does not absolve the appellant taxpayer from the payment

of the tax in default. While the VAT Act does not empower the District

Court to recover tax in default as a fine, it does empower the District

Court to recover the tax in default through the seizure and sale of the

defaulters property by issuing a writ of execution. In other words, had

the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue filed the certificate of tax in

default in the District Court and sought to recover the tax in default

under section 42(6) of the VAT Act, instead of section 43(1), the District

Court would have had jurisdiction to initiate the recovery process

through seizure and sale. Section 42(6) of the VAT Act reads as follows:

Where any tax is in default and the Commissioner-General is of

opinion that the recovery by the means provided in subsection (2) is

impracticable or inexpedient he may issue a certificate to a District

Court having jurisdiction in any district where, the defaulter resides

or in which any property movable or immovable owned by the

defaulter situate containing such particulars of tax and the name

and address of the person or person by whom, the tax is payable,

and the Court shall thereupon direct a writ of execution to issue to

20

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

the Fiscal authorizing and requiring him to seize and sell all or any

of the property movable and immovable of the defaulter, or such part

thereof as he may deem necessary for recovery of the tax, and the

provisions of sections 226 to 297 of the Civil Procedure Code shall,

mutatis mutandis, apply to such seizure and sale.

For the purpose of this section movable property shall include plant

and machinery whether fixed to a building or not.

As stated in Devi Prasad Khandelwal & Sons Ltd. v. Union of India, AIR

1969 Bom 163 at 173:

It is a well-settled principle of interpretation that as long as an

authority has the power to do a thing, it does not matter if he

purports to do it by reference to a wrong provision of law. The order

made can always be justified by reference to the correct provision of

law empowering the authority making the order to make such order.

Solicitor-General v. Perera (1914) 17 NLR 413 was a criminal case filed

under the Excise Ordinance where the licence to sell liquor was cancelled

for failure to make some payment due. The Government Agent cancelled

the licence under section 26(1)(a) of the Ordinance when the correct

section was section 26(1)(b). When the conviction for selling liquor

without a licence was challenged in appeal on this basis, Walter Pereira

J. rejected that argument stating at page 416:

[T]he fact that sub-section (a) of section 26 was cited did not render

the cancellation of the license any the less effectual. The Government

Agent was not bound to cite any section at all.

In Peiris v. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1963) 65 NLR 457 it was

held that a certificate issued to the Magistrate in recovery proceedings

under section 80(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance was not invalidated by

21

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

the mistake of the Assistant Commissioner of Inland Revenue where he

had purported to act under section 64(2)(b) although the correct

procedure would have been under section 65. Sansoni J. (as he then was)

stated at page 458:

It is well-settled that an exercise of a power will be referable to a

jurisdiction which confers validity upon it and not to a jurisdiction

under which it will be nugatory. This principle has been applied even

to cases where a Statute which confers no power has been quoted

as authority for a particular act, and there was in force another

Statute which conferred that power.

This principle has consistently been adopted by our Courts including in

Leechman & Co. Ltd. v. Rangalla Consolidated Ltd [1981] 2 Sri LR 373 at

379-380, Kumaranatunga v. Samarasinghe [1983] 2 Sri LR 63 at 73-74,

Jayawardane v. Ranaweera [2004] 3 Sri LR 37 at 41, Jayathilaka v.

Peoples Bank (SC/APPEAL/92/2011, SC Minutes of 02.04.2014) and

Gifuulanka Motors (Pvt) Limited v. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (SC/HCCA/LA/51/2017, SC Minutes of 27.07.2021).

In light of the foregoing, the Additional District Judge could assume

jurisdiction under Section 42(6) of the VAT Act to recover the tax specified

in the certificate of tax in default through the seizure and sale of the

defaulters property.

This view is further fortified by the following analysis. In the

interpretation of taxing statutes, when the issue pertains to charging

provisions that impose tax liability, as opposed to machinery provisions

that outline the procedure for quantification and enforcement of such

liability, the Court must adhere strictly to the letter of the law rather than

its spirit. If the language of a charging provision is clear and

unambiguous, the Court is bound to give effect to it and cannot interpret

22

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

the words differently on the basis that the literal interpretation does not

reflect the real intention of Parliament. If the wording of a charging

provision is ambiguous, permitting one interpretation favourable to the

taxpayer and another to the tax collector, the Court should adopt the

interpretation that favours the taxpayer until such ambiguity is resolved

by legislative amendment. Conversely, when interpreting machinery

provisions, a more liberal approach is warranted to give effect to the

legislative intent. Machinery provisions are not subject to strict

construction where such interpretation would defeat the purpose of the

statute. If the language of a machinery provision is ambiguous,

permitting one interpretation favouring the taxpayer and another

favouring the tax collector, the Court should adopt the interpretation

favouring the tax collector until the legislature resolves the ambiguity

through an amendment.

In Commissioner of Income Tax, Central Calcutta v. National Taj Traders

(AIR 1980 SC 485 at 491) the Supreme Court of India stated:

[I]t is well settled that the principle that the fiscal statute should be

construed strictly is applicable only to taxing provisions such as a

charging provision or a provision imposing penalty and not to those

parts of the statute which contain machinery provisions.

In Commissioner of Income Tax-III v. M/S. Calcutta Knitwears, Ludhiana

(AIR 2014 SC 2970), the Supreme Court at para 37 emphasized the duty

of the Court to depart from the rule of strict interpretation when

construing machinery provisions of a fiscal statute:

It is the duty of the court while interpreting the machinery provisions

of a taxing statute to give effect to its manifest purpose. Wherever

the intention to impose liability is clear, the Courts ought not be

hesitant in espousing a commonsense interpretation to the

23

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

machinery provisions so that the charge does not fail. The

machinery provisions must, no doubt, be so construed as would

effectuate the object and purpose of the statute and not defeat the

same.

The fact that machinery provisions should be construed by ordinary rules

of construction giving effect to the intention of the legislature was

stressed by the Supreme Court of India in Gursahai Saigal v.

Commissioner of Income Tax, Punjab (AIR 1963 SC 1062 at 1064-1065):

Now it is well recognised that the rule of construction on which the

assessee relies applies only to a taxing provision and has no

application to all provisions in a taxing statue. It does not, for

example, apply to a provision not creating a charge for the tax but

laying down the machinery for its calculation or procedure for its

collection. The provisions in a taxing statute dealing with machinery

for assessment have to be construed by the ordinary rules of

construction, that is to say, in accordance with the clear intention of

the legislature which is to make a charge levied effective.

The necessity of adopting harmonious construction in the interpretation

of machinery provisions was stressed in Film Exhibiters Guild v. State of

Andhra Pradesh (AIR 1987 AP 110 at 117):

But in construing the machinery provisions for assessment and

collection of the tax to make the machinery workable ut res valeat

potius quam pereat, i.e., the Court would avoid that construction

which would fail to relieve the manifest purpose of the legislation on

the presumption that the legislature would enact only for the purpose

of bringing about an effective result. It is not the function of court to

hunt out ambiguities by strained and unnatural meaning, close

reasoning to be adopted; harmonious construction is to be adhered

24

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

to; all the relevant provisions are to be read together to gather the

intention from the language employed, its context, and give effect to

the intention of the legislature. Ingenious attempt to avoid tax is to

be thwarted.

In India United Mills Ltd v. Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax Bombay

(AIR 1955 SC 79 at 82), the Supreme Court of India underscored the

significance of interpreting machinery provisions to complement the

charging provisions, stating: That section is, it should be emphasized, not

a charging section, but a machinery section, and a machinery section

should be so construed as to effectuate the charging sections.

Eminent writers share the same view. Halsburys Laws of England, 4th

Edition (1978) Butterworths, Vol 23, para 86 states:

It is important to distinguish between charging provisions, which

impose the charge to tax, and machinery provisions, which provide

the machinery for the quantification of the charge and the levying

and collection of the tax in respect of the charge so imposed.

Machinery provisions do not impose a charge or extend or restrict a

charge elsewhere clearly imposed. (.) Although not of less moment

or authority than other sections, machinery sections are not subject

to a rigorous construction, so the court will seek not so to construe a

machinery section as to defeat a charge to tax.

N.S. Bindra, Interpretation of Statutes, 13th Edition (2023) LexisNexis,

page 861 supports this view:

It is true that a taxing provision must receive a strict construction at

the hands of the courts and if there is any ambiguity, the benefit of

that ambiguity must go to the assessee. But that is not the same

thing as saying that a taxing provision should not receive a

reasonable construction. The tendency of modern decisions upon the

whole is to narrow down materially the difference between what is

25

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

called a strict and beneficial construction. The principle of strict

construction is applicable only to charging provisions or a provision

imposing penalty, and is not applicable to parts of the taxing statute

which contain machinery provisions.

E. F. Mannix and J. E. Mannix, Australian Income Tax Guide, 26th Edition

(1981) Butterworths, para 206 states:

A distinction must be drawn between a taxing section and a

machinery section, an illustration of the latter being provided by the

provisions relating to the amendment of assessments. Machinery

sections are not subject to especially rigorous construction so that

the courts will not tend to construe a machinery section as to defeat

the charge of tax although it has been held that the absence of

appropriate machinery provisions tends to show that profits do not

come within a charging provision.

J.G. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction, 3rd Edition (1943),

Callaghan and Company, Vol 2, pages 77-78 notes the trend of deviating

from the traditional literal interpretation in favour of the taxpayer:

Many courts once adhered to the general rule that tax statutes

should be strictly construed in favour of the taxpayer, but the present

trend shows a breaking away with liberality of interpretation

resulting in more favourable decisions for the government. As

indicated by Cooley, revenue acts which point out the subjects to be

taxed, and indicate the time, circumstances, and manner of

assessment and collection need not strictly construed, while statutes

imposing burdensome penalties and harsh enforcement by

summary proceedings require interpretation in favor of the taxpayer.

The learned author, in Vol 3, page 297 succinctly set out the need for

reasonable construction in tax statutes in the following words:

26

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

The long-range objectives of all tax measures is the accomplishment

of good social order. Although the variant forms of taxation may

sometimes produce individual hardships, a too stilted interpretation

of tax laws for the benefit of the taxpayer may result in the loss of

revenue at the expense of government and operate to the

disadvantage of others contributing to it support. (..) Therefore, a

reasonable construction of all tax measures should be preferred.

Emphasis belongs upon the general objectives of such laws with the

view to accomplish uniformity and equality among the class of

persons sought to be taxed. Some courts have even subscribed to a

liberal policy in the construction of revenue laws. Thus it has been

stated, If a reason can be discovered for a particular construction of

a statute, and especially of a revenue statute, which construction

would deprive the treasury of revenue, such construction will be

discarded in favour of one that will apply uniformly to all persons

engaged in the same calling or business and so as to raise revenue.

It is pertinent to observe that assessment does not fall under the charging

provisions. In the House of Lords decision of Whitney v. Commissioners

of Inland Revenue (1925) UKHL 10 Tax Cases 88 at 110, Lord Dunedin

remarked:

I shall now permit myself a general observation. Once that it is fixed

that there is liability, it is antecedently highly improbable that the

statute should not go on to make that liability effective. A statute is

designed to be workable, and the interpretation thereof by a Court

should be to secure that object, unless crucial omission or clear

direction makes that end unattainable. Now, there are three stages

in the imposition of a tax: there is the declaration of liability, that is

the part of the statute which determines what persons in respect of

what property are liable. Next, there is assessment. Liability does

not depend on assessment. That, ex-hypothesi, has already been

27

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

fixed. But assessment particularises the exact sum which a person

liable has to pay. Lastly, come the methods of recovery. If the person

taxed does not voluntarily pay.

In the instant case, the appellants grievance, based on sections 42 and

43 of the VAT Act, relates to machinery provisions, and therefore the

Court cannot lean towards the appellant but must interpret the

provisions in a manner that gives effect to the intention of the legislature.

The questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted and the

answers thereto are as follows:

(a) Has the High Court erred in rejecting the appellants jurisdictional

objection by holding that all District Judges appointed to a

particular judicial zone are also Additional Magistrates for that

area, and vice versa, that all Magistrates are Additional District

Judges by virtue of their appointment?

Yes.

(b) Has the High Court erred in failing to consider that the learned

Additional District Judge has no jurisdiction to impose a term of

imprisonment of six months?

Yes.

(c) Has the High Court erred in Law by holding that the District Court

has jurisdiction to entertain a certificate filed under section 43(1)

of the VAT Act, No. 14 of 2002, as amended?

Yes.

For the foregoing reasons, the order of the learned Additional District

Judge of Colombo dated 06.09.2018 and the judgment of the High Court

of Civil Appeal of Colombo dated 16.07.2020 are set aside and the appeal

is allowed.

28

SC/APPEAL/5/2021

The District Court has no jurisdiction to recover the tax in default as a

fine under section 43(1) of the VAT Act.

However, for the reasons stated above, the Additional District Judge is

directed to take appropriate steps to recover the tax in default, as set out

in the certificate of tax in default filed in the District Court dated

30.06.2016, through the seizure and sale of the appellants property in

terms of Section 42(6) of the VAT Act. The Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue is also directed to make appropriate applications to the

District Court for the Court to make suitable orders in that regard.

I shall place on record the significance of the arguments advanced by

learned counsel for the appellant with commendable clarity and force,

notwithstanding the resolute endeavours of learned Deputy Solicitor

General in countering them.

Let the parties bear their own costs.
