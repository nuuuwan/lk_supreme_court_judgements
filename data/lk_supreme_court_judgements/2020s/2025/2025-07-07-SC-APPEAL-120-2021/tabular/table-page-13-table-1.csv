"third  of  the  Nation  Building  Tax  charged  as  a  ‘prescribed  tax  or  levy  ’in  terms  of  Section"
"26(1)(l)(iii) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006."
"The  first  scenario  (i.e.,  if  the  afore-said  subsequent  Regulation  applies  to  the  Respondent"
"Company)  necessarily  means  that  Section 26(1)(l)(iii) of the  Inland Revenue  Act No. 10  of"
"2006 also applies to the Respondent Company."
"The  second  scenario  (i.e.,  if  the  afore-said  subsequent  Regulation  does  not  apply  to  the"
"Respondent  Company;  this 
is  the  argument  advanced  by  the 
learned  counsel  for  the"
"Respondent  Company)  would  then  necessarily  mean  that  Section  26(1)(l)(iii)  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue  Act  No.  10  of  2006  must  be 
interpreted  without  recourse 
to  the  afore-said"
"subsequent  Regulation  made  by  the  Minister.  Indeed,  I  have  chosen  to  take  that  path  in"
"coming to the conclusion I have reached prior to the discussion on the issue of applicability"
"of the afore-said subsequent Regulation made by the Minister to the Respondent Company."
"The said conclusion is that there is no specific provision of law under which the Respondent"
"Company can become entitled to deduct the amount of Nation Building Tax it had earlier paid."
"That is why as already adverted to above by me, I have taken the view that I need not embark"
"on resolving the issue whether the Respondent Company is caught up within the afore-said"
"subsequent Regulation made by the Minister in order to address the issue placed before me"
"in the instant case."
"Moreover, the Respondent Company does not claim that it is an entity which has not paid NBT"
"at the time of importing its products. It does not seek to argue that NBT is not a prescribed"
"tax  or  levy.  It  also  does  not  show  any  other  provision  which  makes  it  entitled  to  have  an"
"exemption from Section 26(1)(l)(iii) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006. What then is"
"the result? The result is that the Respondent Company is not entitled to deduct the amount"
"of Nation Building Tax it had earlier paid, in its return of income. This is because the liability"
"of  the  Respondent  Company to income  tax  without such  deduction is  found  in  a clear and"
"unambiguous  manner  in  the  taxing  statute  coupled  with  the  fact  that  the  Respondent"
"Company has failed to show any other provision which makes it entitled to have an exemption"
"from Section 26(1)(l)(iii) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006."
"Furthermore, I observe that in Section 5(1) of the NBT Act No. 9 of 2009, the Director General"
"of Customs only functions as a collector of NBT at the point of importation of goods. I also"
"observe  that the Act  itself  in  section  5(2),  has  stated  that  any  amount  so  collected  by  the"
