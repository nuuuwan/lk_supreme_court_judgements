"[SC APPEAL 120/2021] Page 6 of 19"
"Section 106(1) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 has mandated that a taxpayer shall"
"furnish a return of his income for any year of assessment commencing on the 1st day of April"
"of  a  given  year  and  ending  on  the  31st  day  of  March  of  the  immediately  succeeding  year."
"Under this section, such taxpayers must submit their returns of income before the 30th day of"
"September  of  the  said  immediately  succeeding  year.  Thus,  the  term  ‘year  of  assessment ’"
"under this Act is a year commencing from 1st April of a given year and ending on the 31st of"
"March of the following year."
"The  Respondent  Company  has  submitted  its  return  of  income  for  the  Year  of  Assessment"
"2009/2010  on  29-11-2010.  The  Year  of  Assessment  which  is  denoted  as  2009/2010  is  the"
"year commencing from 1st April 2009 and ending on 31st of March 2010. Therefore, the year"
"of assessment 2009/2010 is a year of assessment which commences prior to April 1, 2013 for"
"the purpose of Section 163(5) (a)(i) of the IRA."
"Section  163(5)  (a)(i)  of  the  IRA  has  stated  that  the  two-year  period  referred  therein"
"commences to run from the thirtieth day of November of the immediately succeeding year of"
"assessment.  As the relevant  year  of assessment is 2009/2010, the  immediately succeeding"
"year  of  assessment  thereto,  is  the  year  of  assessment  2010/2011.  This  is  the  year  of"
"assessment commencing from 1st April  2010 and ending  on 31st  of March 2011. Therefore,"
"the thirtieth day of November of the immediately succeeding year of assessment referred to"
"in Section 163(5) (a)(i) of the IRA for the purpose of the instant case would be 30-11-2010."
"The Respondent Company has submitted its Return of Income for the year 2009/2010 on 29-"
"11-2010. Hence, it is Section 163(5)(a)(i) of the IRA which applies in respect of the return of"
"income submitted by the Respondent Company in the instant situation. This means that the"
"time period allowed by Section 163(5)(a)(i) of the IRA for making an assessment is a period"
"of two years from the thirtieth day of November 2010. In other words, the afore-said two-"
"year period commences to run from 30-11-2010."
"The next question is whether the afore-said two-year period should be calculated from 30-11-"
"2010 or from 01-12-2010. Section 14(a) and 14(b) of the Interpretation Ordinance resolves"
"this question. The said Section is as follows:"
"Section 14(a) of the Interpretation Ordinance"
