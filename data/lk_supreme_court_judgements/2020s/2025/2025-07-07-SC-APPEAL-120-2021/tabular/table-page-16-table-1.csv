"within  the  stipulated  time  period.  Thus,  the  question  which  comes  to  the  fore  in  these"
"circumstances is the question as to what follows next in such a situation."
"In order to find out an answer to the above issue, let me compare Section 10 of the TAC Act"
"with  section 165(14) of the Inland Revenue Act No.  10 of 2006. One  can  find that Section"

"allowed and tax charged accordingly…’. This is in case the CGIR has failed to determine the"
"appeal within two years. However, there is no similar provision in the TAC Act. If the legislature"
"intended  to  impose  a  sanction  for  failure  to  determine  an  appeal  before  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission  within  the  stipulated  time  period,  it  could  have  very  well  introduced  a  similar"
"provision as in Section 165(14) of the IRA. In the absence of a specific provision to that effect,"
"there is nothing to follow in case the Tax Appeals Commission has failed to adhere to the time"
"limits specified in law."
"In any event, the appeal pending before the Tax Appeals Commission is an appeal lodged by"
"the  Respondent  company.  If  I  am  to  uphold  the  argument  put  forward  on  behalf  of  the"
"Respondent company that the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission is time-barred,"
"the resultant position would be the preservation of the validity of the determination made by"
"the  CGIR.  This  is  because  if  the  Tax  Appeals  Commission’s  determination  is  time-barred,"
"whatever the steps that have thereafter been taken would also not be valid in the face of an"
"invalidity of the TAC determination."
