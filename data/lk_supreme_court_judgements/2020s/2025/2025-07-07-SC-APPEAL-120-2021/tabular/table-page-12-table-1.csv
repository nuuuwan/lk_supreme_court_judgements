"In order to counter the above argument also, the learned President’s Counsel on behalf of the"
"Respondent Company advanced the same argument. He submitted that the position continues"
"to remain the same even after the afore-mentioned Regulation made by the Minister as the"
"said Regulation has allowed the said deduction of two-third of the Nation Building Tax charged"
"only for the persons who pay NBT quarterly. It is the submission of the learned President’s"
"Counsel that the Respondent Company pays NBT at the point of importation on each article"
"and therefore is not caught up within the afore-said Regulation made by the Minister."
"I  must  state  here  that  I  need  not  embark  on  resolving  the  issue  whether  the  Respondent"
"Company is caught up within the afore-said subsequent Regulation made by the Minister in"
"order to address the issue placed before me in the instant case. Such a discourse in my view,"
"would be a deviation from the task I have in hand and therefore, I would not embark on such"
"an exercise. For me, it would suffice to state here that whoever is caught up within the afore-"
"said subsequent Regulation made by the Minister  was not entitled to make such deduction"
"earlier, i.e., before the said subsequent Regulation, such a concession was non-existent and"
"therefore was not available for the taxpayer."
"Moreover, there can only be two possibilities for the issue whether the Respondent Company"
"is  caught  up  within  the  afore-said  subsequent  Regulation  made  by  the  Minister.  The  first"
"possibility  is  that  the  Respondent  Company  is  caught  up  within  the  afore-said  subsequent"
"Regulation. Then, the Respondent Company is allowed to make a deduction of one third of"
"the Nation Building Tax charged as a ‘prescribed tax or levy ’in terms of Section 26(1)(l)(iii)"
"of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  10  of  2006.  The  second  possibility  is  that  the  Respondent"
"Company  is  not  caught  up  within  the  afore-said  subsequent  Regulation.  Then,  since  that"
"Regulation does not apply to it, the Respondent Company cannot make a deduction of one"
