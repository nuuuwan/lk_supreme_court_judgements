"[SC APPEAL 120/2021] Page 19 of 19"
"The Court of Appeal, by its judgment dated 15-03-2018, acting in terms of section 11A(6) of"
"the Tax Appeals Commission Act, has  annulled the  assessment  as it  had held  that  the Tax"
"Appeals Commission has erred in law when it came to the conclusion that the assessment is"
"time  barred.  However,  for  the  reasons  set  out  in  this  judgment,  I  have  held  that  the  said"
"assessment is not time-barred and the Court of Appeal has erred in law when it held that the"
"said assessment is time barred. On this basis, I set aside the conclusion of the Court of Appeal"
"that the Tax Appeals Commission has erred in law when it came to the conclusion that the"
"assessment is not time-barred. I proceed to set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal to"
"annul the assessment affirmed by the Tax Appeals Commission. The Court of Appeal judgment"
"is set aside to that extent and should stand altered to that extent."
"Thus, the assessment issued by the assessor, the determination made by the CGIR, and the"
"determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission affirming the assessment issued by the"
"assessor, will remain unaltered and affirmed. That would be the resultant position."
