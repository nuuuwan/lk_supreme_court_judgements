"clear section which exempts such person from such liability to pay such tax. It is the same"
"principle  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  correctly  adopted  and  applied  when  it  said  in  its"
"judgment “exemption notifications must be interpreted strictly and, in its entirety, and not in"
"parts [Grasim industries Ltd. & Anvor v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anvor and Gwalior Sugar"
"Co. Ltd. v. Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board & others (1999) 8 SCC 547].2 Thus, on the face"
"of these provisions, there is no specific provision of law under which the Respondent Company"
"can become entitled to deduct the amount of Nation Building Tax it had earlier paid."
"It  is  the  contention  of  the  Respondent  Company  that  Section  26(1)(l)(iii)  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 does not apply to the Respondent Company as it is not a person"
"who  makes  quarterly  payments  of  NBT.  The  Respondent  Company  also  argues  that  the"
"payment they make is to Customs at the point of importation of its goods and therefore should"
"not be considered as paying Nation Building Tax. It is the argument advanced on behalf of"
"the Respondent Company that Section 26(1)(l)(iii) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006"
"cannot  be  made  applicable  to  the  Respondent  Company.  The  Respondent  Company  also"
"argues  that  the  amount  it  pays  to  Customs  as  NBT  is  an  ad  hoc  payment  based  on  each"
"transaction which is levied on any person who imports a taxable article. It is the Respondent"
"Company’s argument that the liability to pay NBT quarterly is only imposed on persons who"
"are  liable  to  be  registered  as  NBT  payers  and  not  on  all  persons  who  import/supply  such"
"goods."
"As  pointed  out  by  the  learned  Deputy  Solicitor  General,  the  fact  that  the  subsequent"
"Regulation made by the Minister has allowed one third of the Nation Building Tax charged to"
"be deducted as a prescribed levy in terms of the above-mentioned Section 26(1)(l)(iii) of the"
"Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, has now confirmed the fact that such deduction was non-"
"existent earlier, in particular, at the time relevant to the impugned Assessment. Let me for"
"the sake of completeness, reproduce below, the said Regulation made by the Minister. The"
"Minister  has  made  this  Regulation  under  Section  212  read  with  Section  26  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006."
"2 CA (TAX) No. 17/2017, decided on 15-03-2019, at page 12."
