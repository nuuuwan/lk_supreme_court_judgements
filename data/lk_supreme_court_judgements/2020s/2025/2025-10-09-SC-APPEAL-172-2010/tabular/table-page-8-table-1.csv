"decisions of the District Court and High Court Judges are based on speculation rather than"
"solid proof. The Defendant also argues that the lower Courts failed to consider the principle"
"that a claim for prescriptive rights must fail if there is significant doubt about when or how"
"continuously the alleged use occurred. According to the Defendant, the cited legal authorities"
"establish that uncertainty regarding the timing and nature of the use is detrimental to such a"
"claim. Thus, it is the Defendant’s contention that even if there were occasional or incidental"
"uses of the land which the Defendant does not concede, these would not be sufficient to grant"
"the Plaintiff a legal right-of-way."
"To  claim  prescriptive  title,  a  plaintiff  must  meet  three  key  legal  conditions:  first,  their"
"possession of the property must be continuous and undisturbed; second, this possession must"
"be independent of or adverse to the Defendant’s title; and third, it must have lasted for at least"
"ten years immediately before the lawsuit. The principle of ""adverse user"" is fundamental to"
"claiming a prescriptive title.  The law, however, provides a clear framework for establishing"
"this hostility through a well-defined shift in the burden of proof. At the trial, licensed surveyor"
"Karunaratne Costa testified, confirming the existence of the roadway and its role as the only"
"access to the Plaintiff’s land. Documentary evidence included Plan No. 3159 (‘P1’), Plan No."
"255 (‘P3’), and the Police Complaint (‘P7’). The Plaintiff also presented a building plan (‘P10’)"
"and a sketch (‘P11’), both of which identified the roadway as the access to the Plaintiff’s block"
"of  land.  Additionally,  utility  bills  and  assessment  notices  (‘P14’  to  ‘P37’)  were  submitted,"
"showing  the  property  was  consistently  identified  and  assessed  based  on  its  access  from"
"‘Weerasinghe Mawatha’. Substantial evidence presented to the District Court demonstrates"
"that the Plaintiff has been using the roadway from the outset, starting five years before the"
"Defendant acquired his land."
"Thus, upon an overall consideration of the evidence, I agree with the Trial Judge's conclusion"
"that  the  Plaintiff  had  uninterrupted  use  of  the  roadway  since  1970,  thereby  establishing"
"continuous  possession.  This  use,  which  began  before  the  Defendant  acquired  the  adjacent"
"property, was adverse, as it did not depend on any permission or acknowledgement of the"
"Defendant’s  rights.   I  see  no  reason  to  disturb  the  findings  reached  by  the  learned  District"
"Judge and the learned High Court Judge, both of whom properly invoked the legal principle"
"that, once long-term physical use is proven, the onus shifts to the Defendant to establish that"
