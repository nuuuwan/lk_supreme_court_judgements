This Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following Question of Law set out in paragraph

15(a) of the Petition dated 23.06.2010:

“Did the High Court err in holding that the Respondent had acquired a title to a right

of way by prescription over the portion of the land situated adjoining the Eastern

Boundary in ‘Lot C’ depicted in Plan bearing No. 3159 marked ‘P1’?”

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (‘Plaintiff’) instituted an action in the District Court of

Panadura against the Defendant-Appellant-Appellant (‘Defendant’), seeking, inter alia, a

declaration that, through prescriptive rights, the Plaintiff is entitled to use the current right-of-

way over the consolidated strip of land described in Nos. 1, 2, and 3 of the 3rd Schedule to the

Plaint of the Plaintiff. Alternatively, the Plaintiff sought a declaration that he is entitled to

use the land described in No. 1 of the 3rd Schedule to the Plaint as a right-of-way of necessity.

The Plaintiff claims that he became the owner of the land described in the 1st Schedule to the

Plaint through the final decree issued in the partition action bearing case No. 20241 of the

District Court of Kalutara.

The Defendant filed an answer, admitting only the averments in paragraphs 9 and 11 of the

Plaintiff's Plaint. The stand taken by the Defendant in the District Court was that the Plaintiff

had another roadway other than the right-of-way claimed through the District Court Action.

The learned District Judge of Panadura, delivering her judgment on 09.05.2008, answered the

issues in favour of the Plaintiff and decided that the Plaintiff has a right to possess, during his

lifetime, the land described in the 1st Schedule of the Plaint. Thereafter, the District Court

decided that the Plaintiff is entitled, based on prescription, to use the land described in Nos.

1, 2, and 3 of the 3rd Schedule (the roadway used by both parties) the Plaint of the Plaintiff

and also that the Plaintiff is entitled to use the land described in No. 1 of the 3rd Schedule as

a right-of-way. Additionally, the District Court decided that the Plaintiff is entitled to a right-

Page 5 of 10

of-way of necessity over the land specified in No. 1 of the 3rd Schedule to the Plaint on the

footing that there is no other roadway providing access to the land described in the 1st

Schedule to the Plaint of the Plaintiff. The District Court observed that the Defendant did not

establish the existence of an alternative road for the Plaintiff, despite the Plaintiff having used

the eastern boundary. The Court further noted that there was no evidence to confirm that the

Plaintiff used a roadway to access his land along the eastern boundary of the Defendant’s

property. Moreover, the District Court determined that the Plaintiff’s use of the road was not

based on any permission or license from the Defendant.

The Defendant filed an appeal against the said District Court judgment of the District Court

in the Provincial High Court, exercising civil jurisdiction in the Western Province, holden in

Kalutara (‘High Court’), but the appeal was dismissed. The Defendant challenges both the

said judgments of the High Court and the judgment of the District Court. The learned Judge

of the High Court, affirming the Judgment of the District Court, queried how the Plaintiff

could have used the disputed roadway with the consent of the Defendant when the Plaintiff

was already residing on the property before the Defendant moved into his block of land.

The Plaintiff became the owner of his land by way of the transfer deed No.4208, attested on

12.11.1970 (‘P8’). Thereafter, by Deed of Gift No. 26747 (‘P9’), attested on 15.11.1985, he

gifted the said property (described in the 1st Schedule to the Plaint) to the Plaintiff’s sons, who

are the second and third Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondents. Apparently, the

Plaintiff constructed a house with an asbestos roof in the year 1972. Meanwhile, the

Defendant acquired ownership of the block of land (described in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint)

by way of Deed No.224 dated 17.10.1976 (‘V1’), which lies adjacent to the southern boundary

of the land described in the 1st Schedule to the Plaint. The Plaintiff claims that he has

gained right-of-way by prescription over the lands described in Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of the 3rd

Schedule to the Plaint as shown in Plan No. 255 (‘P3’) made on 19.10.1971.

The Defendant contends that by virtue of the said Deed No. 4208 marked ‘P8’, the Plaintiff

was granted a roadway located on the eastern side of the Plaintiff’s land as described in the

1st Schedule to the Plaint, which connects to a public road. As such, the Defendant asserts

that the Plaintiff cannot claim a lack of access to their land, as the Plaintiff has an alternative

Page 6 of 10

roadway besides the right-of-way claimed. Nonetheless, the Plaintiff argues that the roadway

the Defendant claims to exist on the Plaintiff’s land does not physically exist and was not

present even when the Plaintiff purchased the land. The Plaintiff states that he never used a

roadway across the land known as Thimbirigahawatta, although such roadway is referred to in

the title deeds and anyhow it was not physically identifiable at the time of purchase. The

Plaintiff highlights the testimony of Buddadasa Karunaratne Costa, Licensed Surveyor, who

stated that he had not observed the Plaintiff using any other road other than the road which

is the subject matter of this case, marked as ‘C’ in Plan ‘P1’ presented at Trial, and no other

road to access the Plaintiff’s land. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant purchased their

land five years after the Plaintiff purchased his land, and thus, it is the Defendant’s duty to

establish whether the Defendant granted consent for the Plaintiff to use the roadway described

in the 3rd Schedule to the Plaint.

The Plaintiff further argues that he produced adequate evidence to demonstrate his

acquisition by prolonged use of the right-of-way over the said land described in the 3rd

Schedule to the Plaint and his use of the said roadway since purchasing his land described in

the 1st Schedule. The Plaintiff has accessed electricity and water facilities through this strip of

land, which are registered in their name, clearly indicating continuous and active possession

of the said strip. Additionally, the Plaintiff argues that when he gifted the land to his children,

the same schedule from the original deeds was used by the Notary drafting the Deed of Gift

and the mere omission of a reference to the roadway in the schedule does not undermine the

prescriptive claim supported by ample evidence during the Trial showing it was the only road

used. The Plaintiff contends that the dispute arose when the Defendant suddenly attempted

to block access after the Plaintiff’s land was advertised for sale in newspapers and accordingly,

the Defendant has been disputing the Plaintiff’s right-of-way since 06.07.1999. The Plaintiff

states that if the reliefs sought by the Defendant were granted, it would leave the Plaintiff’s

land inaccessible, effectively forcing the Plaintiff to abandon the land to the Defendant’s

benefit.

The Plaintiff, placing reliance on the dicta in Mercin v Edwin [1984] 1 Sri L.R. 224, submits

that when a person establishes physical user of a right-of-way for the prescriptive method, he

is entitled to succeed in a claim of prescriptive user and mere enjoyment of the right is proof

Page 7 of 10

of the adverse user. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant has not successfully challenged

or disputed the Plaintiff’s use of the roadway since purchasing the land in 1970. The Plaintiff

claims rights not through a formal title but through prescription, asserting adverse use of the

roadway against all others, including the Defendant, for over a decade before the District

Court case began. Additionally, the Plaintiff points to Surveyor’s Plan No. 3159 (‘P1’), which

indicates that the disputed roadway is the only connection between ‘Weerasinghe Mawatha’

and the Plaintiff’s land, with the surveyor’s testimony confirming the Plaintiff’s undisturbed

and continuous use of the roadway since taking possession of the land described in the 1st

Schedule of the Plaint.

A cogent argument of the Defendant is that the Plaintiff’s title deed from 1970 (‘P8’) and the

Deed of Gift (‘P9’) to his children in 1985 make no mention of any right-of-way.

Consequently, the Defendant asserts that no right-of-way was conveyed through these deeds,

and the Plaintiff failed to prove as to when the road usage began. Another aspect of the

submissions made on behalf of the Defendant is that the Plaintiff’s alleged “unchallenged and

uncontradicted” 20-year residence in Australia undermines any claim to prescriptive rights

over the disputed strip of land through usage. The Defendant, placing reliance on Fernando v

Wijesooriya 48 NLR 320, Siman Appu v Christian Appu 1 NLR 288, Saddhasena Terunnanse v

Sumanatissa Thero 36 NLR 422 and Silva et al. v Kumarihamy 25 NLR 449 submits that the

High Court as well as the District Court have erred in law by concluding that the Plaintiff has

prescribed to the subject roadway shown in the said Plan No.255 (‘P3’), which shows that the

roadway was made in 1999 after the District Court action was instituted. The Defendant

further asserts that the said Plan No. 255, does not actually depict the roadway. Moreover,

the Defendant argues that the key issue is not who occupied the land first, but whether there

is evidence to confirm the existence of the alleged roadway and the duration of the Plaintiff’s

use of it.

The Defendant asserts that the Plaintiff bears the full responsibility of proving, with clear and

compelling evidence, the existence of a roadway across the Defendant’s land, a burden the

Plaintiff has failed to meet. The Defendant notes that the Plaintiff did not present any

independent witnesses or provide documentary evidence to support the claimed prolonged

use of the aforesaid strip of land. Without such evidence, the Defendant submits that the

Page 8 of 10

decisions of the District Court and High Court Judges are based on speculation rather than

solid proof. The Defendant also argues that the lower Courts failed to consider the principle

that a claim for prescriptive rights must fail if there is significant doubt about when or how

continuously the alleged use occurred. According to the Defendant, the cited legal authorities

establish that uncertainty regarding the timing and nature of the use is detrimental to such a

claim. Thus, it is the Defendant’s contention that even if there were occasional or incidental

uses of the land which the Defendant does not concede, these would not be sufficient to grant

the Plaintiff a legal right-of-way.

To claim prescriptive title, a plaintiff must meet three key legal conditions: first, their

possession of the property must be continuous and undisturbed; second, this possession must

be independent of or adverse to the Defendant’s title; and third, it must have lasted for at least

ten years immediately before the lawsuit. The principle of "adverse user" is fundamental to

claiming a prescriptive title. The law, however, provides a clear framework for establishing

this hostility through a well-defined shift in the burden of proof. At the trial, licensed surveyor

Karunaratne Costa testified, confirming the existence of the roadway and its role as the only

access to the Plaintiff’s land. Documentary evidence included Plan No. 3159 (‘P1’), Plan No.

255 (‘P3’), and the Police Complaint (‘P7’). The Plaintiff also presented a building plan (‘P10’)

and a sketch (‘P11’), both of which identified the roadway as the access to the Plaintiff’s block

of land. Additionally, utility bills and assessment notices (‘P14’ to ‘P37’) were submitted,

showing the property was consistently identified and assessed based on its access from

‘Weerasinghe Mawatha’. Substantial evidence presented to the District Court demonstrates

that the Plaintiff has been using the roadway from the outset, starting five years before the

Defendant acquired his land.

Thus, upon an overall consideration of the evidence, I agree with the Trial Judge's conclusion

that the Plaintiff had uninterrupted use of the roadway since 1970, thereby establishing

continuous possession. This use, which began before the Defendant acquired the adjacent

property, was adverse, as it did not depend on any permission or acknowledgement of the

Defendant’s rights. I see no reason to disturb the findings reached by the learned District

Judge and the learned High Court Judge, both of whom properly invoked the legal principle

that, once long-term physical use is proven, the onus shifts to the Defendant to establish that

Page 9 of 10

the use was permissive. The Defendant’s failure to discharge this burden, compounded by the

fact that the Plaintiff's use began before the Defendant owned the land, makes his arguments

untenable.

The Defendant’s challenge to the continuity of possession, citing the Plaintiff’s absence, is not

strong enough without proof that the possession of the roadway actually ceased.

Wigneswaran, J in Leisa and another v Simon and Another [2002] 1 Sri. L.R 148 observed that

possession and occupation are two important concepts in land law. Based on the evidence

adduced at the Trial, it cannot be assumed that the Plaintiff’s possession was ousted due to

his alleged visit to Australia. No evidence was led to confirm that the Plaintiff’s absence was

not temporary or that he could not return and re-enter the property at any moment, upon his

choice, without anybody’s permission. Thus, the Defendant’s argument that the prescription

claim would be untenable due to the Plaintiff leaving for Australia will fail as it lacks sufficient

supporting evidence on the above aspects.

The Plaintiff also sought a right-of-way of necessity as an alternative relief, which the District

Court granted and the High Court upheld. The Defendant’s primary objection to this claim

was the alleged presence of an alternative roadway. However, both the District Court and the

High Court found that this alternative road "does not exist and did not exist when the Plaintiff

purchased the land.” A challenge to this finding on appeal would require the Defendant to

demonstrate a legal error in the factual determination. A right-of-way of necessity is a praedial

servitude where a land is landlocked and has no access to a public road. I am satisfied with

the conclusion of the District Court and the High Court upon the right-of-way of necessity. I

have examined such issue on right of way of necessity, noting that the conclusions of both the

High Court and the District Court upon that aspect strengthen the Plaintiff’s claim to

prescriptive title.

Furthermore, I take the view that the Defendant’s argument that this Appeal is futile,

allegedly based on the demise of the Plaintiff (who owns his property subject to life interest)

pending lawsuit, will not affect the question of law upon which this Court has been invited to

adjudicate this Appeal. The Defendant's attempts to rely on irrelevant or misapplied legal

precedents further weaken his position.

Page 10 of 10

Upon a comprehensive review of the evidence and legal arguments presented, I find that the

Plaintiff has satisfactorily established his claim to a prescriptive right-of-way over the land

described in Nos. 1, 2, and 3 of the 3rd Schedule to the Plaint, as well as a right-of-way of

necessity over the land described in No. 1 of the 3rd Schedule. The Plaintiff has demonstrated

continuous, uninterrupted, and adverse use of the roadway since 1970, predating the

Defendant’s acquisition of the adjacent property, supported by substantial evidence, including

Surveyor testimony, documentary plans, and utility records. The Defendant has failed to

discharge the burden of proving permissive use or the existence of an alternative roadway.

Similarly, the Defendant’s challenge to the continuity of possession, based on the Plaintiff’s

alleged absence, lacks merit without evidence that the roadway’s use ceased.

For the reasons stated above, I answer the aforesaid question of law on which Leave to Appeal

was granted, in the negative. The judgments of the High Court (dated 13.05.2010) and the

District Court (09.05.2008), are hereby affirmed and the instant Appeal is dismissed without

costs.
