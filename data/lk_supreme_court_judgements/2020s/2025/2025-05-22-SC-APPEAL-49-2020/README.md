P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) and also the submissions of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Defendant) and concluded the argument of this case.

The Plaintiffs have filed this action in the District Court seeking a declaration of title to the

land described in the Schedule to the Plaint and to eject the Defendant therefrom. The

Defendant in his answer has prayed for the dismissal of the Plaintiffs action and also prayed

for a declaration that he is the owner of a part of the said land which he identified as Lot A3B

depicted in the Plan No. 1049 dated 19-02-1980 prepared by P. R. Boteju, Licensed Surveyor.

The Defendant has produced this Plan No. 1049 marked js 1.

The Defendant has admitted that the late husband of the 1st Plaintiff (father of 2nd and 3rd

Plaintiffs) was the owner of the land referred to in the Plaint. However, it is the position of

the Defendant that the late husband of the 1st Plaintiff (father of 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs) at one

point of time by deed No. 9305 dated 13-01-1972, sold the undivided fifteen perches to his

brother, Hindurangalage Don Karunadasa. The Defendant has produced the said Deed No.

9305 marked js 13. According to the Defendant, said Hindurangalage Don Karunadasa has

thereafter sold the said fifteen perches to the Defendant by the Deed No. 3132 dated 03-09-

1980. The Defendant has produced the said Deed No. 3132 marked js 2. which has clearly

stated that the plot of land transferred was Lot A3B depicted in the Plan No. 1049 dated 19-

02-1980 prepared by P. R. Boteju, Licensed Surveyor.

[SC APPEAL 49/2020] Page 4 of 7

The learned District Judge delivered the judgment dated 20-11-2000 for the Plaintiff on the

basis that the Defendant has failed to prove his title Deeds marked js 2. and js 13. despite

the fact that the said Deeds were only allowed to be marked subject to proof.

Aggrieved by this judgment, the Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal challenging the

said judgment pronounced by the learned District Judge. The Court of Appeal after conclusion

of the said appeal has delivered the judgment dated 20-06-2019 directing the learned

Additional District Judge to enter judgment for the Plaintiffs declaring that the Plaintiffs are

the owners of the land described in the Schedule to the Plaint subject to the grant of relief to

the Defendant, a declaration of Court that the Defendant is the owner of Lot No. A3B depicted

in Plan bearing No. 1049 dated 19-02-1980.

Aggrieved by the said judgment, the Plaintiffs have sought Leave to Appeal from this Court.

This Court has granted Leave to Appeal on the following questions of law:

1. Did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in law in allowing the appeal by

granting the reliefs in favor of the Defendant holding that Deeds marked D2

and D13 had been proved as no objection to those documents had been taken

at the closure of the case, which is contrary to the principle of law laid down

by Your Lordships Court and binding on the Court of Appeal that failure on the

part of a party to object to a document during the trial does not permit Court

to use the document as evidence if the documents which should be proved in

accordance with the procedure laid down in section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance has not been proved?

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in law in granting reliefs to the Defendant based

upon the said deeds marked D2 and D13 which have not been proved in

terms of section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance?

3. Have the parties proved their respective title deeds before the District Court?

It is clear that the Defendants claim is primarily based on the two Deeds marked js 2 and

js 13. When the Defendant marked those documents, the Plaintiff has stated that they can

be marked subject to proof. However, at the time the Defendant closed his case reading the

documents in evidence, the Plaintiff has not objected to those documents being tendered in

evidence. It is on that basis that the Court of Appeal has decided to set aside the conclusion

[SC APPEAL 49/2020] Page 5 of 7

of the learned District Judge that the Defendant has failed to prove these documents. The

Court of Appeal in its judgment has proceeded to hold that it is well settled law that, in a civil

case, if an objection has not been taken at the closure of the case of the opposite party that

the documents marked subject to proof were not proved and therefore be rejected, they

become evidence for all intents and purposes without the requirement of further proof despite

the subject to proof objection taken at the time of marking the said documents. In doing so,

the Court of Appeal has referred to several judgments to wit: Sri Lanka Ports Authority v.

Jugolinija Boal East [1981] 1 Sri LR 18, Balapitiya Gunananda Thero v. Talalle Methananda

Thero [1997] 2 Sri LR 101, Stassen Exports Limited v. Brooke Bond Group Ltd [2010] 2 Sri LR

36, Jamaldeen Abdul Latheef v. Abdul Majeed Mohamed Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333,

Samarakoon v. Gunasekera [2011] 1 Sri LR 149.

The proceedings dated 20-04-2000 clearly shows that the Plaintiff, at the closure of the

Defendants case, has only objected to js 03, js 05, js 08, and js 10 on the basis that

those documents have not been proved. However, the Plaintiff has not objected to the title

deeds marked js 2 and js 13.

Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code deals with tendering of documents in evidence in the

course of a trial. The explanation given at the end of that section would be relevant in this

regard. It is as follows :

Explanation to Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code.

If the opposing party does not, on the document being tendered in evidence, object

to its being received, and if the document is not such as is forbidden by law to be

received in evidence, the court should admit it.

If, however, on the document being tendered the opposing party objects to its being

admitted in evidence, then commonly two questions arise for the court:-

Firstly, whether the document is authenticin other words, is what the party

tendering it represents it to be; and

Secondly, whether, supposing it to be authentic, it constitutes legally admissible

evidence as against the party who is sought to be affected by it.

[SC APPEAL 49/2020] Page 6 of 7

The latter question in general is matter of argument only, but the first must be

supported by such testimony as the party can adduce. If the court is of opinion that

the testimony adduced for this purpose, developed and tested by cross- examination,

makes out a prima facie case of authenticity and is further of opinion that the authentic

document is evidence admissible against the opposing party, then it should admit the

document as before.

If, however, the court is satisfied that either of those questions must be answered in

the negative, then it should refuse to admit the document.

Whether the document is admitted or not it should be marked as soon as any witness

makes a statement with regard to it ; and if not earlier marked on this account, it

must, at least, be marked when the court decides upon admitting it.

In the instant case, as the Plaintiff has not objected to the title deeds marked js 2 and js

13, the provision of law set out in Section 154A (3) of the Civil Procedure Code, as amended

by Section 3 of the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2022, would apply. The

part relevant to the above instance is as follows:

3. Notwithstanding anything contained in section 2 of this Act, and the provisions of

the Evidence Ordinance, in any case or appeal pending on the date of coming into

operation of this Act

(a)

(i) If the opposing party does not object or has not objected to it being

received as evidence on the deed or document being tendered in

evidence; or

(ii) If the opposing party has objected to it being received as evidence on

the deed or document being tendered in evidence but not objected at

the close of a case when such document is read in evidence,

The court shall admit such deed or document as evidence without requiring

further proof;

[SC APPEAL 49/2020] Page 7 of 7

(b) If the opposing party objects or has objected to it being received as evidence,

the court may decide whether it is necessary or it was necessary as the case

may be, to adduce formal proof of the execution or genuineness of any such

deed or document considering the merits of the objections taken with regard

to the execution or genuineness of such deed or document.

Thus, in terms of the law I have set out above, the title deeds marked js 2 and js 13, by

the Defendant shall be admitted as evidence without requiring further proof in the face of the

Plaintiff not objecting to those title deeds at the closure of the Defendants case. This is in

view of the provision of law set out in Section 154A (3) (a) (ii) of the Civil Procedure Code as

amended by the Act No. 17 of 2022.

The Act No. 17 of 2022 has specifically stated that the above provision of law shall apply to

the appeals pending on the date of coming into operation of that Act. Moreover, it has stated

that it shall apply notwithstanding anything contained in the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance. Therefore, although there is a reference to Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance

in the first two questions of law, Section 154A (3) (a) (ii) of the Civil Procedure Code as

amended by the Act No. 17 of 2022 shall apply to this appeal.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer the first two questions of law in the negative. In view of

the above conclusion, I do not think it would be necessary to consider the third question of

law. I affirm the judgment dated 20-06-2019 pronounced by the Court of Appeal and proceed

to dismiss this appeal without costs.
