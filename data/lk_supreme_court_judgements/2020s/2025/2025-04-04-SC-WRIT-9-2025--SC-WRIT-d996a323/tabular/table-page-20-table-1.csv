"and  not  to  “any  decision,  direction  or  act  in  the  exercise  of  the  powers  of  the"
"Commission”. The plain meaning of those provisions is that there is an ouster of the"
"jurisdiction  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  only  in  respect  of  an  exercise  of  power  by  the"
"Election Commission itself…."
"To  sum  up,  the  subject-matter  of  the  appellant’s  writ  application  to  the  Court  of"
"Appeal was mainly, if not entirely, in respect of the alleged acts (and omissions) of"
"officers of the Commissioner of Elections, and not in relation to decisions, directions,"
"acts, orders or rulings of the Commissioner of Elections, He did not allege any exercise"
"(by those officers or by the Commissioner of Elections) of the powers of the Election"
"Commission. Those acts could not have been regarded ex facie as an exercise of the"
"powers of the Commissioner of Elections and/or of the Election Commission…”9"
