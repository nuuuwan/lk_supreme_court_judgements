"Plaintiff acted as the broker of the transaction related to this matter. He also confirmed that the"
"Plaintiff introduced the Defendant when they went to see the land involved in the transaction. He"
"further had stated that the 1% due from his company was paid to the Plaintiff. This witness further"
"had stated that originally, the discussion was to sell the land for Rs. 61,026,000/-, but since the"
"management wanted to reduce the price, Rs. 2,000,000/- was reduced from that and the land was"
"sold at Rs. 59,026,000/-. He also revealed that the owner of the land was one Tharanga Sanjeewa"
"Seneviratne (Appears to be the son of the Defendant) but, as per his evidence, it is clear that the"
"discussions by the Plaintiff for the transactions took place with the Defendant. He had also stated"
"that the Plaintiff did not take part in further discussions to reduce the sale price as aforesaid. It"
"must be noted that, if there was a reduction of price, it is a matter between the true owner and the"
"buyer but not related to the agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant to find a buyer and"
"pay 3% of the sale proceeds as the commission. It must be also noted that no suggestion had been"
"made in cross examination to indicate that the Plaintiff knew that the true owner was the son of"
"the  Defendant  or  that  the  Plaintiff  knew  that  the  Defendant  was  an  agent  of  the  true  owner."
"Furthermore, nothing was suggested in cross examination to say that the transaction has happened"
"for a reduced price due to the intervention of another person. When the Plaintiff closed his case,"
"reading in evidence the documents marked P1 to P4, no objection had been reiterated. It appears"
"when  the  matter  was  in  appeal,  originals  of  the  said  marked  documents  were  not  in  the  brief."
"However, once a document is marked, it becomes part of the brief. If the Appellant wanted the"
"originals to be before the Appellate Court, he should have asked to reconstitute the Appeal brief"
"with the originals. However, the Judgment of the High Court clearly indicates that copies were"
"available and Parties agreed to proceed with the appeal in the absence of the originals. Now, the"
"Appellant  should not  be allowed to  say that the  originals  are not  available. On the other hand,"
"whatever recorded in  evidence  with  regard to  said  documents can be considered as there is  no"
"challenge to what has been recorded in evidence. The evidence led on behalf of the Plaintiff clearly"
"shows that there had been an agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant, for the Defendant"
"to  find  a  buyer  to  sell  the  land  and  if  the  sale  takes  place,  to  pay  3%  of  the  sale  proceeds  as"
"commission to the Plaintiff. Neither in the Answer nor in the issues the Defendant had taken up"
"the position that the Defendant was the disclosed agent of his son to sell the property or that the"
"sale took place due to the intervention of another person. It is only the Defendant who knew the"
"true ownership of the property,  whether it is  his  or his  sonâ€™s, and the relationship with  his  son"
