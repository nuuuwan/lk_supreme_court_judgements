"Defendant to show malice on the part of the Plaintiff as alleged in the Answer. If the agreement"
"was with the son of the Defendant as alleged by the Defendant, I cannot find any reason for the"
"Plaintiff not to opt to file an action against the said son. In the backdrop discussed above, I cannot"
"find fault with the learned District Judge for accepting the Plaintiff’s stance and not believing the"
"Defendant’s stance."
"It appears the Defendant had taken up a stance to state that there was a novation of contract based"
"on his evidence that the land was not sold at the originally agreed price but on a lesser price (Rs."
"2,000,000/- reduced from the originally agreed price). Whether it happened in the same process or"
"it  was  a  new  agreement  between  the  real  owner  and  the  buyer  and  whether  it  falls  within  the"
"concept of novation is a different matter. Whatever it is, it happened with regard to the agreement"
"between the buyer and the real owner. As clearly identified by the Judges below, this matter relates"
"to  the agreement between the  Defendant  and the Plaintiff to  find  a buyer to  sell the land for a"
"commission  to  be  paid  when  the  sale  materialized. The  Plaintiff  had  clearly  established  on  the"
"balance of probability that there was a contract between him and the Defendant to find a buyer to"
"sell the land involved for a commission of 3% to be paid to the Defendant when the sale occurred"
"and the sale was completed. Whether the Defendant acted as an undisclosed agent of his son or on"
"his own is a matter within the knowledge of the Defendant."
"In fact, the learned District Judge made an error by deciding that the entitlement of the commission"
"is only 2% based on the evidence of the Defendant that the reasonable commission would be 1%"
"or 2% when the stance taken by the Defendant is unreliable. Even the learned High Court Judges"
"had  observed  this  error. As  observed  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judges,  the  Plaintiff  has  not"
"appealed against that error."
"When an appeal was made to the High Court by the Defendant, while observing the said error"
"which was not appealed against by the Plaintiff, the learned High Court Judges also confirmed the"
"Judgment of the learned District Judge and dismissed the appeal made by the Defendant. As per"
"the discussion made above, I cannot find any error regarding the final conclusion arrived by the"
"learned High Court Judges. As evinced by the facts of the case, the Defendant either acted as the"
"undisclosed agent of his son or acted on his own in entering into a contract with the Plaintiff. In"
"both occasions the action has to be filed against the Defendant."
