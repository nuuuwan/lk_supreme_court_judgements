"The facts discussed above show that the Defendant did not have reasonable grounds to challenge"
"the decisions of the Courts below. The attempts of the Defendant were to delay the enjoyment of"
"the fruits of victory by the Plaintiff. In such a situation it is not unreasonable to consider exemplary"
"costs. Therefore, this Court decides that the Plaintiff is entitled to five times the costs of all three"
"courts."
"Hence, this Appeal is dismissed with Costs as mentioned above."
