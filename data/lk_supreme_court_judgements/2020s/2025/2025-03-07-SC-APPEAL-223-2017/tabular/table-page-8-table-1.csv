"previously agreed amount. It is the position of the Defendant in his evidence in chief that the first"
"agreement  to  sell the land for  Rs. 61,000,000/-  did  not  realize  and the second arrangement  for"
"which  the  Plaintiff  had  no  contribution  realized  and  he  did  not  receive  any  money  from  The"
"Finance Company."
"Further during the cross examination, the Defendant had stated that both the Defendant and his"
"son came to know the Plaintiff when the Plaintiff came after the newspaper advertisement to meet"
"them. It was the Defendant’s position in cross examination that it was his son who agreed to pay a"
"reasonable amount and there was no agreement to pay 3% as commission. He had attempted to"
"assert that the transaction took place not because of the Plaintiff but due to the intervention of said"
"Pathmini Karunanayake. However, the Defendant during cross examination had admitted that he"
"did not ask anything about Pathmini Karunanayake when cross examining the Plaintiff’s witnesses."
"At one point during the cross examination, the Defendant had said that an advance of Rs. 500,000/-"
"was given to the Plaintiff and on another occasion had said that since the work was not done, a"

"reference  to  P4,  the  Defendant  had  admitted  that  he  had  stated  that  the  land  was  sold  for  Rs."

"later through installments, another Rs. 510,000/- totaling up to Rs. 1,010,000/- to the Plaintiff. In"
"contradiction  to  his  own  Police  statement,  he  had  again  stated  that  the  agreement  took  place"
"between his son and the Plaintiff. Finally, in re-examination the Defendant had stated that final"
"decision was with his son and the advance was paid by him and his son."
"It must be noted that, nowhere in his evidence, the Defendant had taken up the position that he"
