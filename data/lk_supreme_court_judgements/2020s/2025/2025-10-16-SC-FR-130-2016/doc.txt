ARGUED ON : 14.07.2025

DECIDED ON : 16.10.2025

Janak De Silva, J.

The Petitioner is a graduate of the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya. She

seeks to impugn the decision to award the E.O.E. Pereira Gold Medal (Gold Medal) to the

312th Respondent. The Gold Medal was inaugurated by the friends and well-wishers of

Prof. E.O.E. Pereira, formerly Dean, Faculty of Engineering and later Vice Chancellor,

University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, in recognition of the long and distinguished service

rendered by Professor Pereira to the University of Ceylon and the Engineering profession.

The Gold Medal is awarded annually to the most outstanding student graduating from

the Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya, on the basis of scholastic as well as

extra-mural excellence.

In response to a notice issued by the 310th Respondent (Senior Assistant Registrar) on

15.02.2016 (P4), the Petitioner duly submitted her application for the Gold Medal on

19.02.2016 (P5).

Page 39 of 56

On 26.02.2016, the Faculty Board after going through the applications, decided to adopt

a marking scheme based on that used for the “Peradeniya University Gold Medal”(P6B

and P6C). The Petitioner was thereafter informed by the 310th Respondent on 02.03.2016

(by a letter dated 26.02.2016) to re-submit her application under the revised criteria (P6B

and P6C) on or before 03.03.2016 (P6A). A notice of this was put on the notice board

along with documents marked P6B and P6C.

On 09.03.2016 the Faculty Board recommended the Gold Medal to be awarded to the

312th Respondent. The Petitioner, by letter dated 14.03.2016, appealed against the

alteration of the selection criteria and the decision taken by the Faculty Board (P8).

Following this, the Senate at its meeting on 23.03.2016, granted approval to the Faculty

Board’s recommendation. Subsequently, on 02.04.2016, the University Council, resolved

not to interfere with the decision of the Faculty Board. The Petitioner thereafter instituted

this application on 20.04.2016, seeking inter alia to quash the decision to award the Gold

Medal to the 312th Respondent and to direct that it be awarded to her.

The Petitioner alleges that the procedure in recommending and approving the 312th

Respondent as the recipient of the Gold Medal violated her legitimate expectations, is

ultra vires, arbitrary and irrational. The Petitioner seeks relief by way of quashing the

impugned decisions contained in P6B and P6C together with the subsequent decisions of

the Faculty Board, the Senate, and the Council awarding the Gold Medal to the 312th

Respondent.

The Petitioner further prays for a direction compelling the University authorities to re-

evaluate the applications under the valid statutory framework as set out in P2C, or in the

alternative, to grant the Gold Medal directly to the Petitioner, an order for costs and such

other relief as this Court may deem just and equitable.

Page 40 of 56

Leave to proceed has been granted under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. An interim

order was issued restraining the 1st Respondent from awarding the Gold Medal until the

final hearing and determination of this application.

Time Bar

Learned DSG and President’s Counsel raised a preliminary objection that the application

is time barred, as it was not filed within one month of the alleged infringement as required

by Article 126(2) of the Constitution. It was submitted that the operative date of

infringement was 02.03.2016, when the Petitioner was required to re-submit her

application under the new marking scheme as she was aware of the new criteria at that

point in time. On this basis, it is submitted that the filing of the application on 20.04.2016

falls outside the constitutionally mandated time limit.

The Petitioner, however, contends that the infringement was of an imminent and

continuing nature and only crystallized upon the decision of the Senate on 23.03.2016.

Article 126(1) of the Constitution vests sole and exclusive jurisdiction on this Court to hear

and determine any question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement by

executive or administrative action of any fundamental right or language right declared

and recognized by Chapter III or Chapter IV of the Constitution.

In terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution, any person may invoke this jurisdiction

where his fundamental right or language right has been infringed or is about to be

infringed by executive or administrative action.

A person is not compelled to invoke this jurisdiction at the stage where the infringement

is imminent. He may well choose to stay his hand until it is clear that the fundamental

right or language right is infringed and then invoke the jurisdiction of this Court.

Page 41 of 56

This Court while observing that the one-month limitation prescribed by Article 126(2)

must be strictly construed, has at the same time, recognised that where an infringement

is imminent or where its consequences are still unfolding, time will run from the date of

the final operative act.

In Dayaratne and others v. National Savings Bank and Others [ (2002) 3 Sri LR 116 at

126] , Fernando, J. held that:

“An aggrieved person has the right to challenge an infringement not only when it

is imminent but also after it has occurred. The failure to challenge an imminent

infringement in time will never bar a subsequent actual infringement…”

Quite similar to the present case, in Dayaratne (supra), the time began to run only when

the names of the promotes were announced, and not even when the interview panel

recommended their names. The recommendations were not held to amount to an

infringement as the Board of Directors might have refused to accept them subsequently.

Subsection (e) in P6B explicitly states that “the final selection of the recipient of the award

shall be confirmed by the Senate on the recommendations of the Faculty Board of the

relevant faculty”.

In the present case, in addition to the Petitioner appealing against initial

recommendations, the decision of the Council on 02.04.2016 represents the final

determination of the University authorities in relation to the award of the Gold Medal.

This application was filed on 20.04.2016. Therefore, it has been filed within the one-

month of the alleged infringement as prescribed by the Constitution. Accordingly, the

preliminary objection on time bar is overruled.

Before proceeding to examine the issues that arise for consideration, I must clarify a

fundamental matter that arose during the hearing. At one point of time, it was not clear

Page 42 of 56

whether there were two gold medals that were to be awarded by the Faculty of

Engineering, i.e. the Gold Medal and the University of Peradeniya Gold Medal.

In response to this question posed by Court, learned DSG after obtaining instructions from

the representative of the 1st Respondent present in Court, submitted that the effect of

P6B and P6C was the establishment of a new medal titled “Peradeniya University Gold

Medal” for all the faculties including the Faculty of Engineering and that the Gold Medal

ceased to be on offer thereafter.

However, upon a consideration of the paragraph 28 of the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent,

it is clear that the Gold Medal is separate and distinct to the Peradeniya University Gold

Medal.

This stands to reason, as the Gold Medal was established through the donations of the

friends and well-wishers of Prof. E.O.E. Pereira, formerly Dean, Faculty of Engineering and

later Vice Chancellor, University of Ceylon, Peradeniya and established by a Statute whilst

the Peradeniya University Gold Medal was established by Regulations.

Issues

Upon consideration of the pleadings, affidavits, and submissions of learned Counsel, the

following issues arise for determination:

1. Whether the adoption of the new marking scheme in selecting the recipient of the

Gold Medal for the year 2015 was consistent with the governing Statute.

2. Whether the constitution of the Selection Committee was valid in law.

3. Whether the allocation of marks, including the award of marks for an interview

that was not conducted, was procedurally improper, arbitrary or unreasonable.

4. Whether the petitioner holds legitimate expectation with regards to any previous

marking criteria.

Page 43 of 56

In answering the first issue, a key issue that arises is the interplay between the Statute

governing the Gold Medal (P2C) and the Regulations relied upon by the Respondents (P6B

and P6C).

P2C is the governing statue of the award in question, as agreed by both parties, which is

titled as the “EOE Pereira Gold Medal Statue”.

P6B is titled as the “Regulation governing the award of Peradeniya University Gold Medal

for most outstanding student graduating from each faculty.”

P6C is titled as the “Selection Criteria of the Peradeniya University Gold Medal for Most

Outstanding student graduating from each faculty”

It is the position of the Petitioner that the governing instrument in respect of the Gold

Medal is the Statute of the Scholarship Board of 1971 (P2C), approved by the Senate

Advisory Committee in 1973. The Petitioner contends that documents marked P6B and

P6C, which introduce a revised marking scheme are inconsistent with P2C and ought to

be quashed. It is further contended on behalf of the Petitioner that P6B and P6C were

framed in respect of a different award, namely the “Peradeniya University Gold Medal,”

and not the Gold Medal, and therefore have no application to the present matter.

Accordingly, the adoption of P6B and P6C in selecting the 312th Respondent was ultra

vires and of no legal effect.

The Respondents, however, whilst acknowledging that the document marked as

“Peradeniya University Gold Medal”( P6B) was mistakenly laid upon the Petitioner,

submit that while P2C establishes the award, it does not provide a marking scheme or

intelligible criteria for selection. They submit that in the absence of a prescribed scheme,

the Faculty Board was entitled to adopt a suitable mechanism for evaluation, and that the

adoption of a scheme similar as in P6C to that employed for the Peradeniya University

Gold Medal is rational and reasonable.

Page 44 of 56

The 2nd Respondent, who was the then Vice chancellor of the University of Peradeniya,

states that the Scholarship Sub-Committee of the Senate of the University of Peradeniya,

at its 68th meeting on 14.02.2011, drafted regulations which were subsequently tabled at

the 82nd meeting of the Senate on 08.12.2014 and duly approved. He further states that

the contents of the document marked P6B were not adopted by the selection committee

in respect of the Gold Medal, but only the marking scheme approved by the scholarship

sub-committee and the senate marked P6C.

The learned counsel for the Respondent, relying on sections 136 , 140 and 142 of the

Universities Act, submit that Statutes made under the Act are deemed to be Ordinances

promulgated by the University Grants Commission, and that Regulations may be made

subject to such Ordinances. It was further submitted that P2C has been substantially

adhered to, and that the decision to adopt these Regulations merely provided guidance

in the absence of detailed criteria. In other words, Learned Counsel for the Respondent

submits that the said Statute, being a Statute made under the Universities Act, carries the

force of an Ordinance in terms of section 140 of the Act. By contrast, the Regulations

relied upon by the Respondents, namely P6B and P6C, are subordinate instruments in

terms of section 136 of the Act. On this basis, the Respondents contend that the adoption

of P6B and P6C was neither ultra vires nor arbitrary.

In terms of sections 136 and 140 of the Universities Act, Statutes enjoy primacy over

regulations. Regulations such as P6B and P6C cannot displace the governing Statute.

However, since P2C lacks any prescribed criteria, the adoption of supplementary

guidelines cannot be regarded as wholly ultra vires. What remains in issue is whether the

procedure in following them was reasonable, consistent, and fairly applied.

Given the absence of any detailed marking scheme in P2C, it was permissible for the

Faculty to supplement the Statute with a marking scheme, provided it was not

inconsistent with the governing Statute. However, the adoption of supplementary criteria

Page 45 of 56

carries with it a duty to apply such criteria fully, fairly, and consistently. In the present

instance, such criteria were introduced only after applications had already been invited

and submitted, and indeed after the Faculty Board had scrutinised the applications.

Furthermore, the Respondents appear to have selectively adopted certain portions of P6C

while disregarding others, thereby failing to follow the scheme as a whole. Such partial

adoption undermines the legality of the process. The implications of this failure will be

considered in detail under the subsequent issues of procedural impropriety, irrationality,

and arbitrariness.

Moreover, the full scheme, both P6B and P6C were made known to the candidates in two

distinct ways: first, by being directly furnished to the candidates including the Petitioner

along with the request to re-submit her application; and secondly, by being published on

the Faculty notice board when the revised criteria were introduced. Once the University

itself chose to publish and circulate the entirety of the scheme, applicants held a

legitimate expectation that it would be applied in full.

Constitution of the Selection Panel

P6C prescribes a selection panel consisting of five senior academics with the Dean as ex

officio Chairman. The panel was to be appointed by the Faculty Board. The record

indicates that, rather than a Faculty Board appointment, between 26.02.2016 and

09.03.2016, the committee that evaluated applications for the Gold Medal comprised the

Dean and the Heads of Departments (nine members), and that the Faculty Board itself

later recorded the recommendation of the 312th Respondent. The Petitioner asserts that

no Faculty Board meeting took place in the interregnum to effect the formal appointment

of the panel as required by P6C.

Page 46 of 56

The selection process stipulated in P6C is as follows;

Applicants are called from graduates who have obtained GPA 3.5 and above.

Marks are given for involvement in following activities. The medal is awarded for

the graduate who obtained the highest percentage.

1. Academic excellence- 50%

2. Sports- 12.5%

3. Registered Societies and Union- 5%

4. Arts, Drama, Music, Literary and Creative work- 12.5%

5. Research Publications- 10%

6. Interview performance- 10%

It further goes on to say that

“The marks will be allocated by a panel of five senior academics appointed by the

Faculty Board. Dean of the Faculty will function as the chairman ex-officio”

The Petitioner contends that the absence of a proper Faculty Board meeting to appoint

the selection panel and the actual composition of the evaluating committee represent

fundamental procedural defects. It is submitted that a panel not lawfully appointed under

the governing instrument could not make a lawful recommendation. Since no such

meeting was held within this time frame, it was submitted that no selection panel was

lawfully constituted, and accordingly, the recommendation of the 312th Respondent as

the awardee lacks legal validity and is bad in law.

Moreover, the Petitioner submitted that the adoption of the new marking scheme (P6C)

was wholly ultra vires, inasmuch as it was made under the guise of a regulation relating

to a different medal and by a committee not recognised under the governing Statute

(P2C). It was submitted that the Faculty Board, by usurping the role of the selection panel

Page 47 of 56

prescribed by Statute, acted outside jurisdiction. On this basis, it was submitted that the

entire process was void and without legal effect.

In my view, the practice of extracting certain provisions while disregarding others after

the regulations as a whole were notified to applicants, constitutes arbitrariness. This

piecemeal adoption has resulted in inconsistency both in relation to the composition of

the selection panel and in the allocation of marks. For instance, while the composition of

the selection committee was ostensibly to follow the P6C, in practice the Dean and all

Heads of Departments comprised the panel, in excess of what P6C itself envisaged.

Procedural Impropriety

Interview

Apart from the failure to follow the composition of the selection committee according to

P6C, no interview was in fact conducted, although P6C necessitated an interview to be

held, due to alleged insufficiency of time.

The Respondents acknowledge the inability of conducting an interview on the pretext

that there was an urgency in concluding a decision with regards to the recipient of the

Gold Medal, as the convocation was to be held soon.

The urgency of the forthcoming convocation, as referred to in the affidavit of the Vice

Chancellor, does not excuse departure from the mandatory procedure laid down in the

governing regulations. Compliance with procedural rules is not a matter of formality but

of legality; it ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability in the conferment of

honours.

Page 48 of 56

As Bandaranayake, J. (as she was then) held in Dr. Karunanada v. Open University of

Colombo [(2006) 3 Sri LR 225 at 243]:

“Procedural fairness cannot be regarded as a matter which is unimportant.

Procedural safeguards should be the cornerstones of individual liberty and their

right to equality. Her ladyship further moves to cite Frankfurter , J. in McNabbs vs

United States 318 U.S. 332 (1943) which states that “ the history of liberty has

largely been the history of the observance of procedural safeguards”.

In Dayarathna and Others v. Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine and Others

[(1999) 1 Sri LR 393 at 401], Amerasinghe, J. held as follows:

“There must be certainty and predictability if the rule of law is to prevails, which

article 12 of the constitution which among other things, is obviously intended to

satisfy. Article 12 of the constitution requires substantive as well as formal equality:

laws, regulations and executive and administrative rules, procedures and schemes

must not discriminate between individuals on invidious or irrationals grounds; and

officials are required to apply those laws, rules, procedures and schemes

consistently and even-handedly unless the deviation can be objectively and

reasonably justified on the grounds that a legitimate end is being pursued and that

the means to achieve that end are proportionate.”

In this instance, failure to conduct the interview as stipulated by the marking criteria

adopted by the Respondents vitiates the procedural requirements. I hold that, while

purporting to rely on P6B and P6C, the Respondents did not consistently apply them in

their entirety, but adopted only portions as suited. This selective application was

procedurally improper, arbitrary, and inconsistent with the requirements of fairness and

equal treatment.

Page 49 of 56

Exclusivity of certain eligible candidates

Furthermore, although the revised regulations (P6B and P6C) extended eligibility to

candidates securing a Second-Class Upper Division with a GPA of 3.5 or above, the

University in practice limited consideration to candidates with a First-Class only. This

inconsistency between the announced criteria and the actual application thereof is relied

upon by the Petitioner as evidence of procedural impropriety. Learned Counsel submits

that such differential treatment is antithetical to the requirement of equal treatment and

procedural fairness, and has materially prejudiced the Petitioner.

The Respondents reiterate that only the marking criteria was adopted out of the scheme.

They further maintain that no prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner in this instance,

since both the Petitioner and the 312th Respondent, who was eventually awarded the

Gold Medal, were themselves First Class graduates. It is therefore submitted that the

limitation of eligibility to First-Class holders, though not fully consonant with the broader

criteria, did not adversely affect the Petitioner’s own standing.

Even if both principal candidates were First-Class holders, the Court must determine

whether the exclusion of an eligible class of candidates reflects a deeper procedural

malaise that undermines confidence in the decision-making process; the presence or

absence of prejudice to the Petitioner is relevant but not always determinative of legality.

This exclusion of Second-Upper candidates, contrary to the adopted marking scheme,

makes the process tainted and procedurally improper.

As Fernando, J. held in Bennet Rathnayake v. The Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation and

others [ (1999) 2 Sri LR 93 at 107],

“Uncertainty as to procedure and criteria tends to result in a denial of the equal

protection of the law”.

Page 50 of 56

Furthemore, the material before Court shows that upon the adoption of the revised

criteria, only the ten students who had applied under the initial notice were personally

informed, while eligibility under the new scheme was extended to graduates with a

Second-Class Upper Division and a GPA of 3.5 or above. Such students were not

individually notified; instead, a notice was placed on the Faculty notice board. While this

may have sufficed during an academic term when students were regularly present on

campus, by this time all academic activities had concluded. The Respondents submit that

they assumed other students might nevertheless visit the University for various purposes,

but this assumption does not discharge the duty to communicate effectively.

In the present age, universities are equipped with electronic communication systems, and

the failure to utilise such means to notify eligible students of an opportunity of this nature

amounts to a lapse in administrative responsibility. The duty to notify is not satisfied by

passive methods when more direct and reliable means are available. Such lapses reflects

that the administrators were going through some procedural steps merely to project a

due process in calling for applications.

Arbitrariness

The Petitioner challenges the allocation of the marks for the interview, which was never

held, yet in respect of which the 312th Respondent received the full allocation of 10 marks.

She submits that she was only awarded 8 marks, and that this disparity is irrational and

arbitrary.

As explained above, the Respondents acknowledge that no interview was held. They state

that all candidates were given a base allocation of 8 marks, and that additional marks

were awarded only where students had received prizes or awards not otherwise

accounted for in the other categories. It is submitted that the 312th Respondent was given

Page 51 of 56

two extra marks for having obtained the Professor Bartholomeusz Prize for Engineering

Mathematics in 2015, which had not been considered elsewhere in the marking scheme.

As explained in City of Livingston v. Park Conservation District, 2013 MT 234, 371 Mont.

303, 307 P.3d 317,

“A decision is arbitrary if it comes about seemingly at random or by chance or as a

capricious and unreasonable act of will”

The allocation of marks for an interview that was never held is manifestly unreasonable

and arbitrary. To award a candidate the full 10 marks, while another received only 8,

despite no interview being conducted, is a decision no reasonable authority could have

made. To award additional marks under this head, even for a legitimate achievement such

as a faculty prize, is to alter the purpose of the category and to blur the boundaries of

assessment. While it may be desirable to recognise unaccounted achievements, doing so

under the guise of “interview marks” is both arbitrary and unreasonable. If prizes or

awards merited recognition, they should have been expressly incorporated into the

scheme, rather than accommodated in an improvised and inconsistent manner. Such an

approach undermines the integrity and transparency of the process and taints the entire

process.

Commenting on the applicability of the equality clause in terms of Article 14 of the Indian

Constitution Bhagwati, J. (as he then was) in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujiba [AIR (1981) SC

487] held that:

"Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness in State action whether it be of the

legislature or of the executive or of an 'authority' under Article 12, Article 14

immediately springs into action and strikes down such State action. In fact, the

concept of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional

Page 52 of 56

scheme and is a golden thread which runs through the whole of the fabric of the

Constitution”

The Petitioner further submits that the new criteria was vitiated by irrationality and

unreasonableness on the basis that academic achievements were allocated excessive

weightage of 50% of the marks and the inclusion of a separate percentage for research

publications is unreasonable. Reliance is placed on the affidavit marked P2D of Senior

Professor S.B.S. Abeykoon, former Vice Chancellor and former Dean of the Respondent

University, wherein it is affirmed that the attainment of a First-Class degree had

historically been regarded as the benchmark of academic excellence and was treated as

a prerequisite for eligibility for the Gold Medal.

The 2nd Respondent in his affidavit also asserted this position with regards to the non-

entertainment of applicants of anything lower than a First-Class. However, under the

amended criteria embodied in P6B and P6C, 50% of the marks were separately allocated

for academic excellence, thereby rendering the possession of a First-Class an element to

be assessed rather than an absolute threshold for eligibility.

Similarly, the Petitioner alleges that carving out 10% specifically for research, without

adequate justification, distorted the balance between scholastic and extra-mural

performance envisaged by the Statute. It is argued on the basis that different research

projects carry differing weightage and it is irrational to consider them on an equal setting,

as such achievements fall within the broader rubric of academic excellence and should

not have been treated as a separate criterion.

Here I must observe that this contention falls within the ambit of “purely academic

matters” which the Court is reluctant to intervene, as acknowledged in the case of Dr.

Karunananda (supra). This is not to say for a moment that academic decisions are beyond

challenge.

Page 53 of 56

In the academic context, we are cautious before interfering with qualitative judgments

but will intervene where the decision is manifestly arbitrary or lacks any rational basis.

Based on this precept, I note that whilst the Petitioner’s contention that in the past

practice, greater emphasis had been placed on sports and extra-curricular activities once

a First-Class was attained, and this contention reflects the Petitioner’s perception of the

historical approach, the Court finds it difficult to accept that the primary emphasis of the

award should be shifted away from academic achievement in a university context.

The Gold Medal is awarded within a Faculty of Engineering, where scholastic excellence

is necessarily central. Extra-mural achievements are important and were rightly intended

to be considered, but they cannot be elevated above the academic purpose of the

institution. The Court observes that the expression “extra-mural” in isolation ordinarily

connotes activities undertaken outside the classroom or the formal curriculum, and in

some contexts even outside the university itself. In the context of P2C, however, the

reference to extra-mural activities must be understood more broadly to include pursuits

beyond formal academic coursework, such as participation in sports, arts, societies, clubs,

publications, research, and other student activities. It cannot be read as confined

exclusively to sporting achievements. Accordingly, the Court does not find the Petitioner’s

criticism of the weightage accorded to academics and research to be sustainable.

Legitimate Expectation

The Petitioner submits that, unlike the other thirty medals in the Faculty which are based

solely on academic achievement, the Gold Medal was intended to recognise the most

outstanding student by combining academic excellence with extra-curricular

achievement, particularly in sports. She contends that historically, eligibility was confined

to First-Class graduates, with sports performance being the decisive factor, and no

separate marks were given for research or other academic prizes.

Page 54 of 56

The Respondents contend, however, that P2C simply requires consideration of both

scholastic and extra-mural excellence, and that “extra-mural” is not confined to sports.

They argue that activities such as arts, societies, clubs, publications, research, and prizes

equally fall within its scope, and that the Petitioner’s narrow interpretation is inconsistent

with the language of the Statute.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner further submits that there was a consistent practice in

the Faculty, where sports (75% of marks), amongst other extra-curricular activities were

accorded greater weight in the evaluation. It was submitted that the Petitioner had a

legitimate expectation that the same practice would be followed, and that the sudden

departure from it, without notice, amounts to a violation of the petitioner’s legitimate

expectations. The affidavit of Mr. S.B.S. Abeykoon, former Vice Chancellor and former

Dean of the Faculty, affirms that the marking practice historically treated the attainment

of a First-Class as sufficient proof of academic excellence, with greater weight thereafter

being accorded to sports and extra-curricular activities, thereby supporting the

Petitioner’s contention as to the intended criteria.

The Respondents, on the other hand, submit that there was no settled or uniform practice

in awarding the medal from year to year, but rather an ad hoc adoption of different

schemes. Accordingly, the Petitioner cannot rely on any legitimate expectation.

For an expectation to be legitimate it must be founded upon a promise or practice by the

public authority that it said to be bound to fulfil the expectation.

According to P2C(2)(d), the criteria is broadly mentioned as “In making the award, both

the scholastic and extra mural excellence of the student shall be taken into account.” In

the instant case, in scrutinizing the evidence presented to this court by both parties,

although in most years on the surface level it seems that sports have been considered

with greater weightage, no consistent or transparent marking criteria had been

prescribed. The marking sheets that were produced in evidence are not sufficiently

Page 55 of 56

detailed to disclose a concrete basis upon which percentages were to be allocated for

academic performance, sports, and other extra-curricular activities.

While such administrative laxity is regrettable and emphasizing that the 1st Respondent

ought to adopt clear, consistent, and accountable procedures in the preparation of

marking schemes, the absence of a settled practice or binding representation prevents

the Petitioner from establishing a legitimate expectation.

Infringement of Article 12

The failure to apply eligibility criteria consistently, together with the arbitrary allocation

of interview marks, raises concerns of unequal treatment. I hold that the right to equality

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution is infringed not only by overt discrimination but

also by failure to ensure transparency, fairness and consistency in the application of rules.

The record reveals administrative ambiguity: marking sheets with inadequate explanatory

detail, mistaken service of a non-applicable document, lack of transparent publication of

criteria, and in particular the unlawful allocation of marks for an interview that was never

held.

I observe that as a matter of equal protection of law, awarding bodies should adopt and

publish clear, measurable, and intelligible marking schemes in advance, ensure lawful

constitution of selection panels, and provide timely, non-selective notice to all eligible

candidates. Administrative institutions are accountable to the standards of rationality,

transparency and equality; shortcomings in these respects undermine confidence in

awards of institutional prestige and the fairness of the process.

For the reasons more fully set out above, I hold that the procedure adopted in awarding

the Gold Medal for the year 2015 was vitiated by procedural impropriety and

arbitrariness, resulting in a violation of the Petitioner’s fundamental rights under Article

Page 56 of 56

12(1) of the Constitution. However, given the defects in the process, I am not in a position

to direct that the Gold Medal for 2015 be awarded to the Petitioner.

Accordingly, the decisions of the Faculty Board, the Senate, and the Council to award the

medal to the 312th Respondent are hereby quashed. Neither the Petitioner nor the 312th

Respondent shall be entitled to receive the Gold Medal in respect of the 2015

convocation. In view of the lapse of time, and the impracticality of calling for fresh

applications, no further selection shall be made for that year.

In the circumstances of this case, there shall be no order as to costs.

Before parting with this matter, the Court observes that the confusion which has arisen

stems primarily from the absence of a clear and consistently applied marking scheme.

Universities, in conferring medals of this nature, must ensure that criteria are transparent,

uniformly applied, and publicly available in advance. This Court therefore strongly

recommends that the University of Peradeniya takes appropriate steps to formulate and

publish clear regulations governing the award of the E.O.E. Pereira Gold Medal, so that

future recipients are selected through a process that is fair, consistent, and beyond

reproach.
