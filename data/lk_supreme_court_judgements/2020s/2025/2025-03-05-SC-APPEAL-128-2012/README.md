Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Colombo seeking to

partition the land described in the schedule to the plaint between the

plaintiff and the 1st defendant in equal shares. The 2nd defendant was

named as a party as she was in possession of the land. The position of

the plaintiff was that she became entitled to a share of the land by

Deed marked P2 executed by the 1st defendant approximately six months

prior to the institution of the partition action. The 2nd defendant claimed

prescriptive title to the entire land. In two previous litigations (5048/ZL

and 4917/RE), the 2nd defendants rights had been affirmed. There is

overwhelming evidence that the 2nd defendant has been in possession of

the land for several decades without recognising the rights of any other

person, thereby entitling her to successfully claim a prescriptive title to

the land.

After trial, the District Judge, by judgment dated 26.11.2007, held that

the 2nd defendant had acquired prescriptive title to the entire land, except

for the building identified as No. 1 in the Preliminary Plan marked X at

3 SC/APPEAL/128/2012

the trial. The District Judge further held that the building marked No. 1

should be allotted to the plaintiff based on Deed P2 and prescription. (

.)

The District Judge ordered partition of the land and directed that the

interlocutory decree be entered accordingly. (

. .)

Only the 1st defendant preferred an appeal against this judgment to the

High Court. The High Court, by judgment dated 11.11.2010, affirmed the

judgment of the District Court and dismissed the appeal.

This appeal by the 1st defendant is against the said judgment of the High

Court. This Court has granted leave to appeal on the following question

of law proposed by the 1st defendant:

Did the Civil Appeal High Court fail to answer the question whether

the interlocutory decree could be entered in a partition case between

two persons who were supposed to have obtained prescriptive title

to undivided shares?

In my view, this question is misconceived both in law and fact and cannot

be answered, as the District Court judgment was not entered on the basis

of prescriptive title to undivided shares. If I may repeat, what the

District Judge states in the judgment is that the plaintiff, based on Deed

P2 and prescriptive possession, is entitled to building No.1, and the

remaining portion has been acquired by the 2nd defendant by prescriptive

possession.

I accept that once that finding is made, the interlocutory decree can be

entered, but partitioning the land between the plaintiff and the 2nd

4 SC/APPEAL/128/2012

defendant does not arise. I cannot accept the argument advanced on

behalf of the 1st defendant that, when partitioning is not possible, the

action must be dismissed.

Once the District Court decides that a party has acquired prescriptive

title to an identifiable portion of the corpus, that portion needs to be

excluded from the corpus. In this case, except for building No.1, the

remaining portion of the corpus shall be excluded on the basis that it has

been acquired by the 2nd defendant through prescriptive possession.

What remains is building No.1 and the land connected thereto, which

has been allotted to the plaintiff. One might wonder whether the Court

can make such orders. It is possible under the partition law.

Section 26(2)(d) and (f) of the Partition Law read as follows:

The interlocutory decree may include one or more of the following

orders, so however that the orders are not inconsistent with one

another:-

(d) order that any portion of the land representing the share of

any particular party only shall be demarcated and

separated from the remainder of the land;

(f) order that any specified portion of the land sought to be

partitioned or surveyed be excluded from the scope of the

action;

In terms of section 48(1) of the Partition Law, both the interlocutory

decree and the final decree of partition are final and conclusive against

all.

Save as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the interlocutory

decree entered under section 26 and the final decree of partition

entered under section 36 shall, subject to the decision on any appeal

5 SC/APPEAL/128/2012

which may be preferred therefrom, and in the case of an

interlocutory decree, subject also to the provisions of subsection (4)

of this section, be good and sufficient evidence of the title of any

person as to any right, share or interest awarded therein to him and

be final and conclusive for all purposes against all persons

whomsoever, whatever right, title or interest they have, or claim to

have, to or in the land to which such decree relates and

notwithstanding any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof

of title adduced before the court or the fact that all persons concerned

are not parties to the partition action; and the right, share or interest

awarded by any such decree shall be free from all encumbrances

whatsoever other than those specified in that decree.

For the foregoing reasons, except for building No.1 in the Preliminary

Plan marked X, the remaining portion shall be excluded from the corpus

on the basis that the 2nd defendant has acquired prescriptive title to it.

Building No.1 and the portion of land on which it stands shall be allotted

to the plaintiff. The interlocutory decree shall be entered accordingly.

Upon the registration of the interlocutory decree, no further steps are

required to partition the land.

Subject to the above variations and clarifications, I dismiss the appeal

with costs.
