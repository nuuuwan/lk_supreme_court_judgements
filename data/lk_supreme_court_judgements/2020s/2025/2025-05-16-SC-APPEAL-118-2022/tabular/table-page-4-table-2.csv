"At this point, I wish to set out a set of rules out lined in the case of Junaiden"
"Mohamed Haaris v Hon. Attorney General (SC Appeal 118-2017) decided"
"on 9.11.2018 by Justice Aluwihare, which are as follows,"
"“1) The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the"
"proved facts, if it is not, then the inference cannot be drawn."
"2) The proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable"
"inference from them, save the one to be drawn. If they do not exclude other"
"reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the inference"
"sought to be drawn is correct (per Watermeyer J. in R v Blom 1939"
"A.D.188)"
"The rule regarding the exclusion of every hypothesis of innocence before"
"drawing the inference of guilt was laid down way back in 1838 in the case"
"of R vs Hodges 1838 2 Lew, cc.227). The circumstances must be such as to"
"produce moral certainty to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt.”"
