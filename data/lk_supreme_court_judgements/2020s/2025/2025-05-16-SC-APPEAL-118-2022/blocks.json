    "text": "expressed by the author of the Indian Evidence Act as well as the Ceylon Evidence Ordinance No. 12 of 1864, Sir James Fitz-James Stephen. In his book titled An introduction to the Indian Evidence Act, (2nd Impression), after dealing with the topic of conclusive presumptions, learned author then makes the following statement in relation to Section 114, (at p. 181), that the Court may in all cases whatever draw from the facts before it whatever inferences it thinks just (emphasis added). On a similar note, Wijewardene J (as he then was), in Cassim v Udaya Manaar (1943) 45 NLR 519, quoted Tayler on Evidence 12th Ed, para 142, where it is noted that the presumption is not confined to cases of theft but applies to all crimes even the most penal. Thus, on an indictment for arson proof that property which was in the house at the time it was burnt, was soon afterwards found in the possession of the prisoner has been held to raise a probable presumption that he was present and concerned in the offence. A like inference has been raised in the case of murder accompanied by robbery, in the case of burglary and in the case of the possession of a quantity of counterfeit money. His Lordship then added a caution in drawing such presumptions of fact by laying emphasis on the aspect that (at p. 520), the Court has to consider carefully whether the maxim applies to the facts of the case before it because a presumption under Section 114 is not a presumption of law but only a presumption of fact.",
