"arriving  at  the  majority  judgment.  In  the  aforesaid  circumstances,  the  Petitioner"
"contended that the majority judgment was made per incuriam and that the Court of"
"Appeal has the inherent power to set aside the majority judgment and to repair the"
"injury caused to the Petitioner."
"The Respondent objected to the per incuriam application. It was contended that there"
"has  been  wilful  suppression  by  the  Petitioner  from  the  Court  of  Appeal  of  having"
