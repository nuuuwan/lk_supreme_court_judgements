"Samayawardhena, J. (with my learned brother Obeyesekere, J. also agreeing) held (at"
"page 20) as follows:"
"“[…] a decision per incuriam is one given in ignorance or forgetfulness of the law"
"by way of statute or binding precedent, which, had it been considered, would"
"have led to a different decision. It must be reiterated that a decision will not be"
"regarded as per incuriam merely on the ground that another Court thinks that"
"it was wrongly decided; the fault must derive from ignorance of statutory law"
"or binding authority. Also the authority must be a binding rule of law and not"
"merely an authority that is distinguishable."
