"not  sufficient  for  an  abuse  of  process.  There  may  be 
instances  where  multiple"
"proceedings will enhance, rather than impeach, the integrity of the judicial system, or"
"where parties have a valid reason for bringing separate, but related proceedings. The"
"analysis should focus on whether allowing the litigation to proceed would violate the"
"principles 
of 
judicial 
economy, 
consistency, 
finality 
or 
the 
integrity 
of 
the"
"administration of justice."
"The contention of the Petitioner is that upon obtaining a certified copy of the Court of"
"Appeal brief from the Registry of the Court of Appeal for the purpose of tendering to"
"this Court, it was discovered that key documents material to both the defence and the"
"prosecution were missing in the certified copy. Thereafter, with permission of Court,"
"the Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner inspected the original case record. It was then"
"found that the missing documents were part of the productions in the safe custody of"
"the Registry of the Court of Appeal as called for by Court consequent to an application"
"made  by  the  Respondent  from  the  High  Court.  The  Registry  confirmed  that  these"
"documents were not included in the case record since they were not called for during"
"the appeal hearing. Evidently, these documents have not formed part of the judge’s"
"brief."
"Subsequently, by motion dated 22.04.2024, the Petitioner requested certified copies"
"of  these  productions  which  have  now  been  tendered  to  this  Court  marked  “Z”."
"According 
to 
the  Petitioner, 
these 
include  crucial  financial 
records  and  other"
"documents  referred  to 
in  the  majority  judgment.  As  these  documents  were  not"
"available to the Court of Appeal at the time of the appeal hearing, they could not have"
"been  considered 
in  delivering 
the 
judgment  dated  13th  December  2023.  The"
"productions marked “Z” contain critical documents which were referred in the majority"
"judgment.  The  Petitioner  submits 
that  had 
the  Court  of  Appeal  perused  and"
"appreciated the contents of these documents, the Court would have reached a wholly"
"different finding regarding the involvement of the Petitioner. It is on this basis that the"
"Petitioner filed the per incuriam application."
