"and  failure  to  abide  by  binding  precedent),  ignorance  or  forgetfulness  of  a"
"statute is undoubtedly an instance of a decision given per incuriam.‚Äù"
"I agree that the notion per incuriam does not only cover a decision given in ignorance"
"of  either  statute  or  binding  precedent. 
In  Rose  Mary  Barnadus  (supra), 
I  have"
"examined  the  broader  notion  of  per 
incuriam.  However,  assuming  that  several"
"productions  material 
to 
the  defence  of 
the  Petitioner,  were  not  available 
for"
"examination by the judges of the Court of Appeal, that does not make the majority"
"judgment one made per incuriam. This situation is not different from one where all the"
"material productions were available but Court delivered judgment without examining"
"them. Both these grounds may be urged in appeal."
"For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the majority judgment was not one made"
"per incuriam."
"The  narrative  of  this  Special  Leave  to  Appeal  application  and  the  per 
incuriam"
"application makes it clear that the sole intention of the Petitioner was to avoid this"
"Court from making any determination on the Special Leave to Appeal application and"
"the objections raised therein. This was done in order to ensure that the per incuriam"
"application  is  taken  up  first  and  determined  by  the  Court  of  Appeal.  The  Petitioner"
"must be aware of the reasons for attempting to do so. Towards this end, the Petitioner"
"sought to employ several machinations including not taking dates in March, 2025 in"
"the Supreme Court while at the same time urging the Court of Appeal to grant and"
"then  accepting  dates  in  March,  2025.  These  practices  must  be  condemned  in  the"
"strongest  terms. Unfortunately, the Court of  Appeal, for reasons best known to  the"
"Court, became a willing partner in this unethical and unacceptable process by sprinting"
"to make a determination on the per incuriam application before this Court determined"
"on the preliminary objection of the State."
