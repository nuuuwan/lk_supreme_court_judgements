Argued on: 09.06.2025

Decided on: 11.07.2025

Janak De Silva, J.

The 8th Accused-Appellant-Petitioner (Petitioner) together with 13 other accused

persons were indicted by the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent (Respondent) by

an indictment dated 08.09.2007 before the High Court of Colombo on 34 counts

including aiding, abetting, conspiring and the commission of misappropriation of

public funds punishable in terms of Section 386 of the Penal Code and Section 5(1) of

the Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 as amended. Out of the 34 counts, 13 counts

pertained to the Petitioner. This case has now come to be referred to as the VAT Case.

After trial, the Petitioner was found guilty of all the charges against him and sentenced

to 20 years rigorous imprisonment in respect of each count (to run concurrently), fines

of three times the value of the amounts set out in each charge and the forfeiture of all

property of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner, along with several other accused who were convicted, appealed to the

Court of Appeal in C.A. Appeal Nos. 297-301/2014. The Court of Appeal by majority

(Abayakoon, J. with Gurusinghe, J. agreeing) dismissed the appeal (majority judgment).

Karunaratne, J. (President, Court of Appeal) acquitted the Petitioner from all charges.

Page 4 of 16

Aggrieved by the majority judgment, the Petitioner filed this Special Leave to Appeal

application on 23.01.2024. The Petitioner sought inter alia an interim order staying the

implementation and/or execution of the majority judgment. The Petitioner moved that

this matter be listed on 27.06.2024, 02.07.2024 or 03.07.2024 to support for interim

relief. The listing judge specified the date of support as 27.06.2024.

On that date, this matter was refixed for support on 27.02.2025 as learned SDSG who

was appearing for the Respondent was overseas.

Thereafter, the Respondent filed a motion dated 27.09.2024 along with a copy of a

petition filed by the Petitioner in the Court of Appeal marked X1, a copy of motion the

Respondent had filed in response marked X2 objecting to the application of the

Petitioner and a copy of the written submissions tendered by the Respondent on

18.09.2024 marked X3 and moved that it be filed of record.

According to these papers, the Petitioner had filed a petition dated 27.06.2024 (per

incuriam application) in C.A. Appeal Nos. 297-301/2014 seeking inter alia the following

relief:

(a) Declare that the majority judgment dated 13.12.2023 is made per incuriam;

(b) Quash and set aside and/or vacate the majority judgment;

(c) As an alternative to above prayer, quash and/or set aside and/or vacate the

portion of the majority judgment pertaining to the Petitioner;

(d) Set aside the conviction entered against the Petitioner;

(e) Acquit and/or discharge the Petitioner;

(f) As an alternative, re-hear and/or order to re-hear the appeal of the Petitioner.

The core complaint made by the Petitioner in the per incuriam application is that

several documents that were marked during the trial in the High Court did not form

part and parcel of the original case record in C.A. Appeal Nos. 297-301/2014. As such

these documents were mistakenly not included in the case record (i.e. docket and

judges briefs) and therefore not made available to the Court of Appeal at the time of

the hearing of the appeal and therefore were not considered by the Court of Appeal in

Page 5 of 16

arriving at the majority judgment. In the aforesaid circumstances, the Petitioner

contended that the majority judgment was made per incuriam and that the Court of

Appeal has the inherent power to set aside the majority judgment and to repair the

injury caused to the Petitioner.

The Respondent objected to the per incuriam application. It was contended that there

has been wilful suppression by the Petitioner from the Court of Appeal of having

invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by way of Special Leave to Appeal. Moreover, it

was contended that the Court of Appeal was now functus officio and that the Petitioner

is seeking the identical relief from both the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal.

The Respondent further submitted that the Petitioner was represented in the Court of

Appeal by learned Presidents Counsel and that no application was made to call for and

examine any specific document/documents at the argument stage. All documents

which were required by both parties at the stage of argument were available and there

was no complaint whatsoever by either party at the stage of the argument that any

document that such party required was missing at the argument stage.

By the motion dated 27.09.2024, the Respondent further averred that the Court of

Appeal has heard Counsel for the Petitioner in support of the per incuriam application

and had fixed the matter for written submissions of parties on whether a 5-judge bench

of the Court of Appeal should hear it and that the order pertaining to the said

application made by the Petitioner is fixed for 30.09.2024.

On 17.02.2025, the Petitioner filed a motion and moved that this Special Leave to

Appeal application be taken out of the list of cases fixed for support on 27.02.2025 and

mentioned on that day. The reason adduced was that the senior counsel appearing for

the Petitioner would be abroad from 25.02.2025 to 01.03.2025 and as such unable to

appear before Court. The listing judge had made a minute directing that the motion be

supported on the next date.

On 21.02.2025, the Respondent filed a further motion and strongly objected to the

Petitioner seeking to maintain two separate proceedings in the Court of Appeal and

Page 6 of 16

the Supreme Court and asserted that the Petitioner will necessarily have to decide on

which application he wishes to pursue. The Respondent asserted that this application

was made while resisting both applications as neither has any merit whatsoever.

When this matter was taken up for support on 27.02.2025, junior counsel appearing

for the Petitioner supported the motion dated 17.02.2025 and submitted that the

senior counsel for the Petitioner is presently overseas and unable to participate in

these proceedings. He moved that this matter be re-fixed for Special Leave to Appeal.

Learned ASG submitted that for reasons he expounded in open court, he wishes to

raise a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of this application seeking

Special Leave to Appeal against the majority judgment.

In view of the circumstances stated in the submissions of the learned ASG, my learned

brother Kodagoda, PC, J., the Presiding Judge, requested my learned brother

Obeyesekere, J. to assign an exceptionally early date for inquiry into the preliminary

objection. Junior counsel then indicated that the senior counsel cannot take a date in

March, due to his non-availability during that month.

Court then fixed this matter for support on 01.04.2025 on top of the list.

Thereafter, the Respondent filed a further motion dated 10.03.2025 apprising Court

on the steps taken in the per incuriam application in the Court of Appeal. The inquiry

into the per incuriam application came up for inquiry on 04.03.2025 and the Petitioner

informed Court that he is ready for inquiry. The learned ASG had then brought to the

attention of the Court of Appeal that a complaint was made to the Supreme Court and

that hearing on the objection was fixed for 01.04.2025 and moved to differ the hearing

in the Court of Appeal until that complaint is properly looked in to by the Supreme

Court.

However, the Court of Appeal had permitted the Counsel for the Petitioner to make his

submission since the senior counsel for the Petitioner informed that the per incuriam

application can be heard despite the Special Leave to Appeal application pending in

the Supreme Court. The learned ASG then suggested that a joint motion can be filed if

Page 7 of 16

necessary to expedite the hearing in the Supreme Court but the senior counsel for the

Petitioner had made an application to the Court of Appeal to take up the matter and

suggested several dates in March 2025. Thereupon, the Court of Appeal proceeded to

hear the matter and adjourned further hearing for 19.03.2025.

Having appraised this Court of these developments, the Respondent sought a suitable

direction/order of Court since the per incuriam application before the Court of Appeal

is made urging similar relief.

These matters were brought to the attention of the listing judge, my learned brother,

Obeyesekere, J. who made a minute that the matters referred to in the motion

occurred in open court when this matter was taken up on 27.02.2025. My learned

brother directed that this matter be referred to my learned brother Kodagoda, PC, J.

who presided on that date. My learned brother Kodagoda, PC, J. had then made a

minute on 21.03.2025 that the date fixed for support of this application shall stand.

On 28.03.2025, the Petitioner filed a motion stating that the Respondent had filed

several documents pertaining to the per incuriam application but the Respondent has

not tendered the copy of the brief marked Z marked with the motion and moved

that it be filed of record.

On 01.04.2025 this application could not be reached as there were a number of cases

connected with the Local Government elections. However, learned ASG submitted that

there is an urgency in this matter and moved that this be listed on top of the list. He

further informed Court that he has received a set of papers on Friday and that he

reserves his right to raise objections to them. This matter was re-fixed for support on

15.05.2025 on top of the list.

Thereafter, the Respondent filed a motion dated 07.05.2025 setting out further steps

that had been taken place on 19.03.2025 in the per incuriam application. It appears

that on 19.03.2025, the learned ASG could not appear before the Court of Appeal due

to personal reasons and an application for a postponement had been made. The

Petitioner had insisted for a very short date and the Court of Appeal had specially fixed

Page 8 of 16

that matter for 20.03.2025 at 9.30 a.m. On that day, the Court of Appeal had directed

both parties to file written submissions by 04.04.2025 and fixed the matter to decide

whether notice should be issued in the per incuriam application.

On 15.05.2025, this Special Leave to Appeal application could not be taken up as it

appears that the Court was not properly constituted. The matter was fixed for support

on 09.06.2025 on top of the list.

On that day, junior counsel appearing for the Petitioner moved that the matter be

refixed as the senior counsel appearing for the Petitioner was indisposed. Learned ASG

strongly objected to this application and marked ready and drew the attention of Court

to the several motions he had filed drawing attention to the parallel proceedings in the

Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. He submitted that this was an abuse of the

process of Court and that he wanted to make an application to stay the proceedings in

the Court of Appeal.

We heard junior counsel for the Petitioner. He submitted that the per incuriam

application before the Court of Appeal was filed on the basis that the majority of the

marked documents were not available before the Judges at the time of writing the

judgment. The Petitioner had come to know that situation after filing this Special Leave

to Appeal application. He denied that there is an abuse of the process of court. Junior

counsel then submitted that senior counsel had instructed him to withdraw this Special

Leave to Appeal application in view of the objection raised by the learned ASG. Junior

counsel for the Petitioner further made an application that the senior counsel be given

a date to reply to the submissions of the learned ASG as he is down with Chikungunya.

We gave careful consideration to the matters brought to the attention of Court. An

interim order was issued preventing the Court of Appeal from delivering any order in

the per incuriam application until an order is made by this Court on the preliminary

objection raised by the State.

The Petitioner was granted time until 20.06.2025 to file written submissions with

notice to the State. No further date was to be granted for the written submissions.

Page 9 of 16

The Petitioner then filed a motion dated 16.06.2025 informing Court that having

considered the preliminary objection raised by the Respondent, the Petitioner has

instructed to withdraw the instant Special Leave to Appeal application with permission

of Court and therefore it may not be necessary to burden Court with the inquiry on the

preliminary objection. An application was made therein to mention this matter on a

date prior 20.06.2025 (preferably 17/06/2025, 18/06/2025 or 19/06/2025) to enable

counsel to make an application for withdrawal.

Since junior counsel for the Petitioner had made a similar application on 09.06.2025

and Court thereafter fixed this matter for order or judgment on the preliminary

objection raised by the State, we did not proceed to list this matter in open court.

On 20.06.2025, both the Petitioner and Respondent filed written submissions as

directed.

The Respondent in the motion tendering the written submissions submitted that if the

Court is inclined to allow the application made by the Petitioner to withdraw this

Special Leave to Appeal application, permission to do so should be granted only on the

following conditions:

(1) Court of Appeal judgment in CA Appeal Nos. 297-301/2014 delivered on

13.12.2024 is affirmed by Court and the Court of Appeal judgment is considered

as final;

(2) Direction made to the Court of Appeal not to re-open C.A. Appeal Nos. 297-

301/2014 on any ground whatsoever in view of the affirmation of the Court of

Appeal judgment dated 13.12.2024 by this Court and the provisions of Article

118 of the Constitution;

(3) Costs to be awarded to the State for the abuse of process attempted by the

Petitioner who is a person absconding from the entirety of the judicial process

from the High Court stage onwards;

(4) Any other suitable direction/order be made by this Court with regard to the

contumacious and contemptuous conduct on the part of the Petitioner and the

Page 10 of 16

unprecedented and gross abuse of process attempted on behalf of the

Petitioner.

Rule 15 of the Supreme Court Rules regulates any application for withdrawal of a

Special Leave to Appeal application. It reads as follows:

The Petitioner in an application for Special Leave to Appeal may apply, at any

time, to withdraw such application, having served notice of such application to

withdraw on every Respondent who has entered an appearance at the Registry;

and the Court may after making any necessary inquiry into the matter permit

the withdrawal of such application on such terms as to costs and otherwise as

it thinks fit. (emphasis added)

A petitioner does not have an absolute right to withdraw a Special Leave to Appeal

application made to this Court. It can be done only with the prior permission of Court.

The application may be allowed by Court after necessary inquiry. The inquiry must be

directed towards examining inter alia whether a petitioner has wasted the valuable

resources of court in filing that application or whether there has been any abuse of the

process of Court. After such inquiry, the application for withdrawal may be allowed on

such terms as to costs and otherwise as Court thinks fit. Rule 15 does not specify the

other terms, other than an order for costs, envisaged therein. Abuse of process of Court

is a matter that Court can take into consideration in determining such terms.

Abuse of Process of Court

The core contention of the learned ASG is that the per incuriam application is an abuse

of the process of Court as the same issue is impugned in these proceedings as well.

In Saskatchewan (Environment) v. Metis Nation Saskatchewan [2025 SCC 4] it was

held that a multiplicity of proceedings which engage the same issues can amount to an

abuse of process; duplicative proceedings might waste the resources of the parties,

courts and witnesses, or might risk inconsistent results and therefore undermine the

credibility of the judicial process. However, the fact that there are two or more ongoing

legal proceedings which involve the same, or similar, parties or legal issues, is in itself

Page 11 of 16

not sufficient for an abuse of process. There may be instances where multiple

proceedings will enhance, rather than impeach, the integrity of the judicial system, or

where parties have a valid reason for bringing separate, but related proceedings. The

analysis should focus on whether allowing the litigation to proceed would violate the

principles of judicial economy, consistency, finality or the integrity of the

administration of justice.

The contention of the Petitioner is that upon obtaining a certified copy of the Court of

Appeal brief from the Registry of the Court of Appeal for the purpose of tendering to

this Court, it was discovered that key documents material to both the defence and the

prosecution were missing in the certified copy. Thereafter, with permission of Court,

the Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner inspected the original case record. It was then

found that the missing documents were part of the productions in the safe custody of

the Registry of the Court of Appeal as called for by Court consequent to an application

made by the Respondent from the High Court. The Registry confirmed that these

documents were not included in the case record since they were not called for during

the appeal hearing. Evidently, these documents have not formed part of the judges

brief.

Subsequently, by motion dated 22.04.2024, the Petitioner requested certified copies

of these productions which have now been tendered to this Court marked Z.

According to the Petitioner, these include crucial financial records and other

documents referred to in the majority judgment. As these documents were not

available to the Court of Appeal at the time of the appeal hearing, they could not have

been considered in delivering the judgment dated 13th December 2023. The

productions marked Z contain critical documents which were referred in the majority

judgment. The Petitioner submits that had the Court of Appeal perused and

appreciated the contents of these documents, the Court would have reached a wholly

different finding regarding the involvement of the Petitioner. It is on this basis that the

Petitioner filed the per incuriam application.

Page 12 of 16

At the outset, it must be stated that the position of the Petitioner is based on a

complete misunderstanding of the procedure relating to criminal appeals from the

High Court. Where an appeal is lodged in the High Court addressed to the Court of

Appeal against a judgment of the High Court exercising its criminal jurisdiction, the

productions of the case are generally not sent to the Court of Appeal as part of the

appeal brief unless and until the Court of Appeal ex mero motu or on the application

of a party, calls for such productions from the High Court.

This practise is reflected in the letter dated 17.06.2019 sent by the Registrar of the High

Court to the Registrar of the Court of Appeal. The appeal brief was sent to the Court of

Appeal from the High Court with this letter which is found at Vol. I of our brief attached

to the motion dated 21.05.2024 submitted by the Petitioner. The last paragraph therein

specifically states that the productions of this case is retained in the High Court

Production Branch.

This being the inveterate practice, it was open for the Counsel for the Petitioner and

other appellants as well as the State to have called for any of these productions had

they considered it material to their case. It appears that the State had made such an

application and some of the productions were called for. The Petitioner did not

although defended by senior Presidents Counsel well experienced in criminal

proceedings. The written submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioner in the Court of

Appeal on 27.04.2021 do not make reference to any specific productions. The

necessary conclusion is that they were not material to the grounds of appeal of the

Petitioner.

Moreover, the contention of the Petitioner that the majority judgment makes

reference to several productions not part of the original brief is misconceived in fact.

The majority judgment discusses the culpability of the Petitioner from pages 68-76

which includes the grounds of appeal urged by the Petitioner and their consideration.

There is no reference made therein to any specific document.

Page 13 of 16

The notion of per incuriam has generally been given a narrow interpretation. A per

incuriam decision is a decision given by a Court in ignorance of the terms of a statute

or binding decision [See Young v. British Aeroplane Co. Ltd. (1944) 1 KB 718;

Huddersfield Police Authority v. Watson (1947) KB 842; Peter Limb v. Union Jack

Removals Ltd. & Anor (1998) 1 WLR 1354; Billimoria v. Minister of Lands and Land

Development & Mahaweli Development and Others (1978-79-80) 1 Sri LR 10;

Hettiarachchi v. Seneviratne, Deputy Bribery Commissioner and Others (1994) 3 Sri

LR 293].

Nevertheless, the Petitioner submits that there a contemporary wider interpretation

of the notion [See Morelle LD. v. Wakeling (1955) 2 QB 379; Broome v. Cassell & Co.

Ltd. (1971) 2 All ER 187; Gunasena v. Bandaratilleke (2000) 1 Sri LR 292; Kariyawasam

(supra); Indika Lakmini Pathirana v. AG (C.A. 225/2014, C.A.M. 02.10.2018); Cargills

Agrifoods Ltd. v. Kalyani Dahanayake, Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and

6 Others (C.A. (Writ) 198/2012); Mohamed Haneefa Ishaththu Nawma v. Mohamed

Abdul Wahab Mohamed Gouse and Others (C.A. 784/1992(F), C.A.M. 19.10.2018),

Rose Mary Barnadus v. O.M.D.S. Pester Perera and Others (C.A. PHC 09/2013, C.A.M.

28.09.2018)].

However, there is a binding decision of 5 judges of this Court in Subasinghe

Mudiyanselage Rosalin Bertha v. Maththumagala Kankanamge Juwan Appu [S.C.

Appeal No. 160/2016, S.C.M. 02.12.2022] where my learned brother

Samayawardhena, J. (with my learned brother Obeyesekere, J. also agreeing) held (at

page 20) as follows:

[] a decision per incuriam is one given in ignorance or forgetfulness of the law

by way of statute or binding precedent, which, had it been considered, would

have led to a different decision. It must be reiterated that a decision will not be

regarded as per incuriam merely on the ground that another Court thinks that

it was wrongly decided; the fault must derive from ignorance of statutory law

or binding authority. Also the authority must be a binding rule of law and not

merely an authority that is distinguishable.

Page 14 of 16

This does not mean that a decision per incuriam is only a decision given in

ignorance of either statute or binding precedent; there can be other instances

where a decision may be regarded as per incuriam, but such instances are rare.

However, of these two exceptions also (i.e. failure to follow a statutory provision

and failure to abide by binding precedent), ignorance or forgetfulness of a

statute is undoubtedly an instance of a decision given per incuriam.

I agree that the notion per incuriam does not only cover a decision given in ignorance

of either statute or binding precedent. In Rose Mary Barnadus (supra), I have

examined the broader notion of per incuriam. However, assuming that several

productions material to the defence of the Petitioner, were not available for

examination by the judges of the Court of Appeal, that does not make the majority

judgment one made per incuriam. This situation is not different from one where all the

material productions were available but Court delivered judgment without examining

them. Both these grounds may be urged in appeal.

For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the majority judgment was not one made

per incuriam.

The narrative of this Special Leave to Appeal application and the per incuriam

application makes it clear that the sole intention of the Petitioner was to avoid this

Court from making any determination on the Special Leave to Appeal application and

the objections raised therein. This was done in order to ensure that the per incuriam

application is taken up first and determined by the Court of Appeal. The Petitioner

must be aware of the reasons for attempting to do so. Towards this end, the Petitioner

sought to employ several machinations including not taking dates in March, 2025 in

the Supreme Court while at the same time urging the Court of Appeal to grant and

then accepting dates in March, 2025. These practices must be condemned in the

strongest terms. Unfortunately, the Court of Appeal, for reasons best known to the

Court, became a willing partner in this unethical and unacceptable process by sprinting

to make a determination on the per incuriam application before this Court determined

on the preliminary objection of the State.

Page 15 of 16

In Kumarasinghe v. Weliveriya [S.C. Spl. L.A. 37/2012, S.C.M. 12.11.2013], Court was

confronted with a situation where there was blatant abuse of the process of Court by

the petitioner filing multiple actions that had caused an unnecessary delay in the

deliverance of justice and a poor allocation of the resources at the Courts disposal.

Tilakawardane, J. held (at page 7) that the Court cannot over emphasize the need to

appropriately deal with litigants who attempt to abuse the process of Court and

thereby cause unnecessary delay and costs to other parties in order to ensure that, in

the future, litigants will not be tempted to indulge in such ill-conceived practices.

The application made by the Petitioner to withdraw this Special Leave to Appeal

application is not one made bona fide. The per incuriam application was filed on

27.06.2024. The learned ASG objected to that application by motion dated 31.07.2024

and tendered written submissions on 18.09.2024. Further written submissions of the

Respondent on whether notice should be issued in the per incuriam application was

filed in the Court of Appeal dated 07.04.2025. This Special Leave to Appeal application

was taken up on 15.05.2025. The Petitioner did not make any application to withdraw

it on that day. It is only after the learned ASG reiterated his objections on his feet on

09.06.2025 was a belated application made to withdraw this Special Leave to Appeal

application. By a strange coincidence the Court of Appeal had by then concluded the

hearing on the question of notice in the per incuriam application and was to deliver its

order.

I have no hesitation in concluding that the per incuriam application of the Petitioner is

an abuse of the process of Court. The Petitioner went to extraordinary levels to render

nugatory the jurisdiction of this Court in the Special Leave to Appeal application with

a view to obtaining an order from the Court of Appeal in the per incuriam application.

This amounts to contemptuous conduct on the part of the Petitioner. This Court has a

bounden duty as the highest and final superior Court of record in the Republic to

safeguard its constitutional jurisdiction and condemn in the strongest terms any

attempt to render its jurisdiction nugatory by any litigant by resorting to abuse of

process of Court.

Page 16 of 16

For the foregoing reasons, we allow the application for withdrawal of the Special Leave

to Appeal application filed on 23.01.2024 against the majority judgment of the Court

of Appeal delivered on 13.12.2023, subject to the payment of Rs. 500,000/= as state

costs by the Petitioner.

In view of the withdrawal of the Special Leave to Appeal application by the Petitioner,

we affirm the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. It follows that, upon this Court

affirming the said judgment, the matter stands conclusively determined, and the Court

of Appeal does not have any power to deal with the per incuriam application.

Accordingly, the Court of Appeal shall not entertain the per incuriam application any

further.
