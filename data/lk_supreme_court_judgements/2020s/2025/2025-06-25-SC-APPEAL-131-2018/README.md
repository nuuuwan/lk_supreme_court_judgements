5 SC/APPEAL/131/2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court against the 1 and

2 defendants seeking a right of way over Lot 2 depicted in Plan No. 584

prepared by Mr. Padeniya, Licensed Surveyor (marked X), from his land to

the public road, based on prescription and/or necessity. The said roadway

traverses the land owned by the 1 and 2 defendants, who are husband

and wife.

In their answer, the 1 and 2 defendants denied the plaintiffs claim and

asserted that the plaintiff had enjoyed access to his land via a roadway over

the land of one Punchi Banda, situated to the north of their property. They

further contended that it was only after Punchi Banda obstructed that

access that the plaintiff began asserting a right of way over their land.

The successors in title to Punchi Banda were thereafter added as the 3 to

7 defendants. In their answer, they too denied that the plaintiff ever used

a roadway over their land.

At the trial, several witnesses were called, and a number of documents were

marked in evidence. Among the documents marked were five survey plans.

In addition to Plan No. 584 prepared by Mr. Padeniya (marked X), which is

referred to in the plaint, the following plans were produced: Plan No. 804 by

Mr. Wijeratne, L.S. (marked 1V1); Plan No. 205090 by Mr. Edirisinghe, L.S.

(marked 1V9/3V2); and Plan Nos. 1824 and 1825 by Mr. Yapa, L.S. (marked

1V7 and 3V1, respectively). The respective surveyors were in fact called to

give evidence at the trial. It was a full trial.

After trial, the learned District Judge, in a well-considered judgment, held

that the plaintiff is entitled to use Lot 2 in Plan No. 584 prepared by Mr.

Padeniya (marked X), as a right of way. However, the learned Judge imposed

certain restrictions on the manner in which that right is to be exercised,

depending on the purpose for which the roadway is used.

6 SC/APPEAL/131/2018

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Court, the 1 and 2

defendants preferred an appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal. The High

Court, in an equally well-considered judgment, affirmed the judgment of the

District Court. However, the High Court removed the restrictions imposed

by the District Judge on the use of the roadway, observing that there was

no justification for such limitations once it was held that the plaintiff was

entitled to use Lot 2 in Plan No. 584 as a right of way.

A previous Bench of this Court granted leave to appeal against the judgment

of the High Court on the question of whether the High Court erred in law

in granting a right of way by prescription in the absence of any evidence by

the plaintiff to prove prescription. This question presupposes that there

was no evidence to prove prescription, which is not correct. Both the District

Court and the High Court analysed the evidence extensively and concluded

that the evidence led before the District Court was sufficient, on a balance

of probabilities, to support the finding that the plaintiff had acquired the

right of way by prescription.

At the argument, the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1 and 2

defendants relied on a few selected items of evidence to contend that there

was insufficient material to support a finding on prescription. One such

submission was that the High Court failed to consider the contents of the

report of Surveyor Padeniya, wherein it is stated, inter alia, that there was

no roadway on Lot 2 of his Plan No. 584. This contention is untenable. What

the surveyor in fact states is: 2

.

.

. This observation is consistent with the position of the plaintiff, who

instituted the present action upon being prevented by the 1 and 2

defendants from using the said roadway. It is in that context that the

surveyor states that there is no existing roadway on Lot 2.

7 SC/APPEAL/131/2018

What is shown in Plan No. 804 of Mr. Wijeratne is the road shown by the

1st and 2nd defendants as the road used by the plaintiff previously, and not

an existing roadway. In his post-argument written submissions, the learned

Presidents Counsel for the 1 and 2 defendants has highlighted some

selected portions of Mr. Wijeratnes testimony in an attempt to show that

the plaintiff used a roadway over Punchi Bandas land and not over the land

of the 1 and 2 defendants. This submission is not persuasive. The

evidence of Mr. Wijeratne cannot be considered in piecemeal, but must be

assessed holistically and in conjunction with the evidence of the other

surveyors who testified at the trial. When the evidence of all the surveyors

is considered together, it does not support the contention advanced on

behalf of the 1st and 2nd defendants that the roadway used by the plaintiff

lay over the land of Punchi Banda.

Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, I do not consider

that this Court should interfere with the judgment of the High Court, which

affirmed the well-considered judgment of the District Court, on the basis

that there was insufficient evidence to establish a servitude of right of way

by prescription over Lot 2 in Plan No. 584.

I accordingly answer the question of law on which leave to appeal was

granted in the negative, and dismiss the appeal, but without costs.
