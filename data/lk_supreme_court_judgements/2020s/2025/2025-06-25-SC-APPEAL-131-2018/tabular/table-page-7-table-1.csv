"7                            SC/APPEAL/131/2018"
"What is shown in Plan No. 804 of Mr. Wijeratne is the road shown by the"
"1st and 2nd defendants as the road used by the plaintiff previously, and not"
"an existing roadway. In his post-argument written submissions, the learned"
"President’s  Counsel  for  the  1ˢᵗ  and  2ⁿᵈ  defendants  has  highlighted  some"
"selected portions of Mr. Wijeratne’s testimony in an attempt to show that"
"the plaintiff used a roadway over Punchi Banda’s land and not over the land"
"of  the  1ˢᵗ  and  2ⁿᵈ  defendants.  This  submission  is  not  persuasive.  The"
"evidence of Mr. Wijeratne cannot be considered in piecemeal, but must be"
"assessed  holistically  and  in  conjunction  with  the  evidence  of  the  other"
"surveyors who testified at the trial. When the evidence of all the surveyors"
"is  considered  together,  it  does  not  support  the  contention  advanced  on"
"behalf of the 1st and 2nd defendants that the roadway used by the plaintiff"
"lay over the land of Punchi Banda."
"Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, I do not consider"
"that this Court should interfere with the judgment of the High Court, which"
"affirmed the well-considered judgment of the District Court, on the basis"
"that there was insufficient evidence to establish a servitude of right of way"
"by prescription over Lot 2 in Plan No. 584."
"I  accordingly  answer  the  question  of  law  on  which  leave  to  appeal  was"
"granted in the negative, and dismiss the appeal, but without costs."
