"Samayawardhena, J."
"The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court against the 1ˢᵗ and"
"2ⁿᵈ defendants seeking a right of way over Lot 2 depicted in Plan No. 584"
"prepared by Mr. Padeniya, Licensed Surveyor (marked X), from his land to"
"the public road, based on prescription and/or necessity. The said roadway"
"traverses the land owned by the 1ˢᵗ and 2ⁿᵈ defendants, who are husband"
"and wife."
"In their answer, the 1ˢᵗ and 2ⁿᵈ defendants denied the plaintiff’s claim and"
"asserted that the plaintiff had enjoyed access to his land via a roadway over"
"the land of one Punchi Banda, situated to the north of their property. They"
"further  contended  that  it  was  only  after  Punchi  Banda  obstructed  that"
"access that the plaintiff began asserting a right of way over their land."
"The successors in title to Punchi Banda were thereafter added as the 3ʳᵈ to"
"7ᵗʰ defendants. In their answer, they too denied that the plaintiff ever used"
"a roadway over their land."
"At the trial, several witnesses were called, and a number of documents were"
"marked in evidence. Among the documents marked were five survey plans."
"In addition to Plan No. 584 prepared by Mr. Padeniya (marked X), which is"
"referred to in the plaint, the following plans were produced: Plan No. 804 by"
"Mr. Wijeratne, L.S. (marked 1V1); Plan No. 205090 by Mr. Edirisinghe, L.S."
"(marked 1V9/3V2); and Plan Nos. 1824 and 1825 by Mr. Yapa, L.S. (marked"
"1V7 and 3V1, respectively). The respective surveyors were in fact called to"
"give evidence at the trial. It was a full trial."
"After trial, the learned District Judge, in a well-considered judgment, held"
"that the plaintiff is entitled to use Lot 2 in Plan No. 584 prepared by Mr."
"Padeniya (marked X), as a right of way. However, the learned Judge imposed"
"certain restrictions on the  manner in which that right is to be exercised,"
"depending on the purpose for which the roadway is used."
