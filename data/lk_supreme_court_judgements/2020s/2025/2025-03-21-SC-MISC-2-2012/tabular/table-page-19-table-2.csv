"complaint  against  the  party  and  a  reasonable opportunity to respond form an integral part of any"
"fair hearing. As Lord Mustill held in  Regina v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex"
"parte Doody [(1994) 1 A.C. 531 at 560D-G]:"
"“[…]  (2)  The  standards  of  fairness  are  not  immutable.  They  may  change  with  the"
"passage  of  time,  both  in  general and in their application to decisions of a particular"
"type.  (3)  The  principles  of  fairness  are  not  to  be  applied by rote identically in every"
"situation. What fairness demands is dependent on the context of the decision, and this"
"is  to  be  taken into account in all its aspects. (4) An essential feature of the context is"
"the statute which creates the discretion, as regards both its language and the shape of"
"the  legal  administrative  system  within  which  the  decision  is  taken.  (5) Fairness will"
"very  often  require  that a person who may be adversely affected by the decision will"
"have  an  opportunity  to  make  representations  on  his  own  behalf  either  before  the"
"decision  is  taken  with  a  view  to  producing  a  favourable  result;  or  after it is taken"
"with  a  view  to  procuring  its  modification;  or  both.  (6)  Since  the  person  affected"
"usually cannot make worthwhile representations without knowing what factors may"
"weigh against his interest’s fairness will very often require that he is informed of the"
"gist of the case which he has to answer.” (emphasis added)"
