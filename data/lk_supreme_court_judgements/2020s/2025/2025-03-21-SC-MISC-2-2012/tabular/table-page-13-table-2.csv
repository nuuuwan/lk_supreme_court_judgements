"In Ladd v. Marshall [1954] 3 All E.R. at 748, Denning, L.J. held, ""In order to justify the reception",""
"of fresh evidence or a new trial, three conditions must be fulfilled:",""
"1.","first,  it  must  be  shown  that  the  evidence  could  not  have  been  obtained  with  reasonable"
"","diligence for use at the trial:"
"2.","second,  the  evidence  must  be  such  that,  if  given,  it  would  probably  have  an  important"
"","influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive:"
"3.","third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must"
"","be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible‚Äù."
