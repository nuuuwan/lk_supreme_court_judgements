"Although the content of a fair hearing depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, there"
"are  certain  integral  elements  that  form  the  core  of  any  fair  hearing.  It  is  not my intention to lay"
"down  an  exhaustive  list  of  the  core  elements  of  a  fair  hearing.  Nevertheless,  the  notice  of  the"
"complaint  against  the  party  and  a  reasonable opportunity to respond form an integral part of any"
"fair hearing. As Lord Mustill held in  Regina v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex"
"parte Doody [(1994) 1 A.C. 531 at 560D-G]:"
