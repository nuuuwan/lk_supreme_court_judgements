"for,  (ii)  the  applicant  had  acted  fraudulently  in  obtaining  the  licence,  or  (iii)  the  applicant  had"
"acted  in  breach  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  such  licence.  However,  an  enabling  statute  can"
"negative  such  inherent  power,  through  specific  provision.  It  is  necessary  to  emphasise  that such"
"inherent  power  is  not  unlimited,  should  be  exercised  in  good  faith,  with  due  diligence, for good"
"reasons, and above all in compliance with the rules of natural justice”"
"As such, the licensing authority may step beyond the scenario’s set out in section 15(7) of the Act"
"when  suspending/revoking  a  license,  provided  such powers are exercised with compliance of the"
"rules of natural justice. The rules of natural justice maintain that all parties must be heard before a"
"decision  is  made.  Since  such  an  opportunity  has  not been given to the Appellant in this case the"
"above mentioned inherent powers of the authority would not apply to this case."
"Based  on  the  above,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  rules  of  natural  justice  required  the  Secretary  to"
"afford  an  opportunity  to  the  Appellant  present  his case entirely and to pursue and respond to the"
"impugned documents if the Secretary were to act on it, which the Secretary did not do."
"I  find  the  Secretary  fell  into  error  when  he  decided  to  act  on  the  contents  of  the  documents"
"submitted during the appeal stage without ascertaining the veracity of its contents and/or the stand"
"the Appellant took regarding the same."
"In  the  circumstances  aforesaid  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  decision  of  the  Secretary  which  is"
"impugned  in  these  proceedings  cannot  be  allowed  to  stand.  Accordingly,  the  decision  of  the"
"Secretary to the Ministry of Environment [6th Respondent] P9 and P9a dated 27.06.2012 as well"
"as the decision of the Chairman of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority [5th Respondent] P7"
"are hereby quashed."
"Appeal allowed without costs."
