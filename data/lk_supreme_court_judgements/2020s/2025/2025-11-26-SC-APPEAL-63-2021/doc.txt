RESPONDENT

Before: Justice A. L. Shiran Gooneratne

Justice Janak De Silva

Justice Sampath B. Abayakoon

Counsel: Dr. Sunil Cooray with Sudarshani Cooray instructed by Diana

Stephanie Rodrigo for the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant.

The 1st Defendant-Respondent-Respondent is absent and

unrepresented.

Argued on: 11/09/2025

Decided on: 26/11/2025

A. L. Shiran Gooneratne, Acting Chief Justice

By Plaint dated 04/10/2001, the Plaintiff–Respondent–Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the “Appellant”) instituted Case No. 6055/L in the District Court of

Negombo against the 1st Defendant–Respondent–Respondent and the 2nd

Defendant–Appellant–-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the “1st

Respondent” and the “2nd Respondent” respectively), seeking, inter alia, a

declaration of title to the land described in the Schedule to the Plaint, a declaration

that Deed No. 4729 dated 11/01/1998 is not an act or deed of the Appellant, and is

Page 5 of 13

fraudulently executed, a declaration that Deed No. 4730 dated 13/01/1998

constitutes a fraudulent act of the 1st Respondent and does not convey any title to

the 1st Respondent, a declaration that Deed No. 1127, under which the 2nd

Respondent Bank claims title is invalid and conveys no right, title, or interest to

the said land, an order for the ejectment of the 1st Respondent from the said

premises, and for damages.

In paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Plaint, the Appellant avers that by Deed No. 6119

dated 24/08/1963, her mother, K. Winifreeda Perera, became the lawful owner of

the subject property, and that by Deed No. 15494 dated 02/07/1979, her mother

transferred the said property to the Appellant, having a life interest for herself and

her husband, Festus Kelambi.

In paragraph 9 of the Plaint, the Appellant states that the 1st Respondent, acting

fraudulently, executed Deed No. 4729 dated 11/01/1998, purporting that the

Appellant and her mother had transferred their rights to Festus Kelambi, and

thereafter fraudulently executed Deed No. 4730 dated 13/01/1998, alleging that

Festus Kelambi had transferred his rights to the 1st Respondent.

In paragraphs 10, 11, and 12 of the Plaint, the Appellant claims that neither she nor

her mother signed Deed No. 4729, and that the 1st Respondent, without any right,

title, or interest in the said land, executed Deed No. 4730 and subsequently

mortgaged the premises in suit to the 2nd Respondent Bank by Deed No. 1127, to

obtain a loan. The Appellant completely repudiated the due execution of the Deeds

based on forgery and sought an invalidation of the Deeds in question.

In paragraph 20 of the Appellant's pleading, the Appellant specifically avers that

during the period from 1994 to 1999, she was never present in Sri Lanka to execute

the Deeds which purported to contain her signature.

By Answer dated 09/07/2003, the 1st Respondent admitted title in the Appellant

and her mother to the disputed land however, he alleged that the Deeds Nos. 4729

and 4730, and the Mortgage Bond No. 1127 were duly executed; therefore, the

Appellant parted with her title and prayed for a dismissal of the Plaint.

Halfway through the 1st Respondent’s case, the learned Counsel for the 1st

Respondent informed Court that he had no instructions to appear on behalf of his

client. In the circumstances, the case proceeded ex parte against the 1st

Respondent.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Additional District Judge, by Judgment

dated 04/05/2018, concluded that based on the Deeds and the evidence presented,

the Court was satisfied that the Appellant had established her title to the disputed

premises, and accordingly decided in favor of the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment, the 1st Respondent appealed to the Civil

Appeal High Court of the Western Province holden in Negombo (“the Appellate

Court”), challenging the Judgment dated 04/05/2018 delivered by the Additional

District Judge of Negombo.

After hearing and considering the submissions of both parties, the Appellate Court

allowed the appeal filed by the 1st Respondent. Being aggrieved by the Judgment of

the Appellate Court dated 30/11/2020, the Appellant is before this Court.

The Appellant, by Petition dated 21/12/2020, seeks to set aside the said Judgment

dated 30/11/2020 delivered by the Appellate Court.

By Order dated 23/03/2021, this Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following

questions of law raised by the Appellant;

1. Did the Civil Appellate High Court err in law by holding that the Plaintiff

failed to prove the signature contained in the deed marked P5 by not calling

an expert witness?

2. Did the High Court err in law by holding that the Plaintiff failed to prove that

the deed marked as P5 was the fraudulent deed?

3. Did the High Court err in law by holding that the Plaintiff did not adduce

evidence to prove that the impugned signature in deed No. P5 is not hers?

In addition to that, the Counsel for the 2nd Respondent Bank raised the following

question of law;

Page 7 of 13

4. Did the Plaintiff lead evidence at the trial to establish the title to the corpus?

When this matter was mentioned on 04/12/2023, the Court observed that by

motion dated 27/09/2022, the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent had entered a

settlement. Accordingly, the Court discharged the 2nd Respondent from further

proceedings, thereby obviating the necessity of answering the 4th question of law.

The Power of Attorney holder of the Appellant, in his testimony before the trial

Court, stated that in 1998, while the Appellant was abroad, the 1st Respondent had

fraudulently executed Deed Nos. 4729 (marked P5) and 4730 (marked P6). He

further stated that the 1st Respondent subsequently obtained a loan of Rs.

475,000/- from the 2nd Respondent Bank by executing Deed No. 1127 as security

for the said loan. The Power of Attorney holder also testified that he became aware

of the execution of the impugned Deeds only in the year 2000 and denied signing

the impugned Deeds.

He further testified that at the time the impugned Deed P5 was signed, the

Appellant's mother was out of the country and stated that the signature claimed to

be that of the Appellant’s mother is not her genuine signature.

In her evidence, the Appellant categorically stated that she had never signed the

impugned Deeds nor given any instructions to her Power of Attorney holder to

transfer her rights to the disputed land. The Appellant further testified that she was

able to produce her passport to establish that she was out of the country at the time

the impugned Deeds were executed. However, the direction given by the trial Court

to produce that evidence was subsequently expunged from the case record by an

order of the Court of Appeal. The Appellant's mother could not testify in Court

since she was deceased at the time the Appellant commenced her case.

The Notary who executed Deed Nos. 4729 and 4730 was described by the trial

Court as an “eighty-nine-year-old feeble person” who, at times, was unable to

answer questions with clarity. Nevertheless, the Court observed that the Notary

had testified to knowing the 1st Respondent as the person who gave instructions to

prepare the impugned Deeds. It is further noted that, according to the attestation

Page 8 of 13

clause, the Notary expressly stated that he was not personally known to the

Appellant or her mother, the executants of the impugned Deeds, but was only

known to the two attesting witnesses.

Upon a consideration of the totality of the evidence, the trial Court held that the

Appellant had established, on a balance of probabilities, that the Deeds marked P5

and P6 were not signed by her. Accordingly, in terms of Section 68 of the Evidence

Ordinance, the burden of proving that the impugned Deed No. 4729, P5 was duly

signed by the Appellant fell upon the 1st Respondent, and that burden had not been

discharged. Consequently, Deed No. 4730 P6 was also held to be invalid.

However, the Appellate Court observed that the Appellant had failed to adduce the

evidence of an expert witness to establish that the signatures appearing in the Deed

marked P5 were not that of the Appellant or her mother. The Court further held

that, in the absence of cogent evidence, the burden of proving that the said Deed

was tainted with fraud lies upon the Appellant. Consequently, the Appellate Court

concluded that the Appellant had not discharged the burden of proof required to

establish that the signature appearing in Deed P5 was not hers.

It is pertinent to note that the Appellant, through her own testimony as well as the

evidence of her Power of Attorney holder, consistently maintained that, at the time

the impugned Deeds marked P5 and P6 were executed, neither the Appellant nor

her mother was present in the country. It was further asserted that neither the

Appellant nor the Power of Attorney holder had signed the said impugned Deeds.

To establish her absence from the country during the relevant period, the Appellant

tendered her passport in evidence. The 1st Respondent objected, however, the

learned District Judge permitted the passport to be marked in evidence. The Court

of Appeal, by a subsequent interim order, has set aside the order of the District

Court permitting the tendering of the passport.

Even though the Appellant produced the two questioned Deeds in evidence, she

has, having raised specific issues to that effect, challenged their genuineness. On

the other hand, the 1st Respondent, by issues No. 15, 16, and 17, alleged execution

Page 9 of 13

of the Deeds marked P5 and P6 in his favour. The 1st Respondent, being the party

relying on the said Deeds, bears the burden of establishing their due execution.

Therefore, unless due execution is duly discharged, the said Deeds cannot be

permitted to stand in evidence.

In terms of Section 154A (1) proviso (a) of the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment)

Act No. 17 of 2022, where the execution or genuineness of a deed is specifically

impeached and raised as an issue in the pleadings, the evidentiary presumption

ordinarily afforded to such documents is displaced. The party relying on the deed

should then lead evidence to prove its due execution and genuineness.

Section 154A (1) proviso (a) of the Civil Procedure Code, reads thus;

154A. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance

(Chapter 14), in any proceedings under this Code, it shall not be necessary to

adduce formal proof of the execution or genuineness of any deed, or document

which is required by law to be attested, other than a will executed under the

Wills Ordinance (Chapter 60), and on the face of it purports to have been duly

executed, unless–

(a) in the pleadings or further pleadings in an action filed under

regular procedure in terms of this Code, the execution or

genuineness of such deed or document is impeached and raised as

an issue; or

(b) the court requires such proof:

Provided that, the provisions of this section shall not be applicable in an

event, a party to an action seeks to produce any deed or document not

included in the pleadings of that party at any proceedings under this Code.

(2) The provisions of subsection (1), shall mutatis mutandis apply in the

actions on summary procedure under this Code.”.

In relying on the above provision of the Amendment Act. No 17 of 2022, this Court

is also statutorily bound to consider the Transitional Provisions stipulated in its

Section 3, for the reason that this Appeal has been pending before this Court at the

time the Amendment Act came into force.

Section 3 of the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2022 reads thus;

3. Notwithstanding anything contained in section 2 of this Act, and the

provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, in any case or appeal pending on the

date of coming into operation of this Act –

(a) (i) if the opposing party does not object or has not objected to it being

received as evidence on the deed or document being tendered in evidence;

or

(ii) if the opposing party has objected to it being received as evidence

on the deed or document being tendered in evidence but not objected at the

close of a case when such document is read in evidence, the court shall

admit such deed or document as evidence without requiring further proof;

(b) if the opposing party objects or has objected to it being received as

evidence, the court may decide whether it is necessary or it was necessary as

the case may be, to adduce formal proof of the execution or genuineness of any

such deed or document considering the merits of the objections taken with

regard to the execution or genuineness of such deed or document.

In this case, it is noted that the factual circumstances of this case have not been

contemplated under the Transitional Provisions, as the impugned deed itself has been

produced by the Appellant. Therefore, the need does not arise for the 1st Respondent

to object to the document as stated in the above Section. Hence, to consider it as an

admitted document would not be in the interest of justice or the spirit of the statute,

and in any event, the objection to the document by the Appellant (the party producing

the document) has been consistent throughout the case. Thus, I am of the opinion that

this Court should examine whether there had been sufficient evidence in regard to the

authenticity of the document for it to be considered as a validly executed deed.

It is trite law that Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance mandates

strict compliance with formal requirements in respect of transactions involving

land or other immovable property. The provision unequivocally renders void any

sale, transfer, mortgage, or agreement relating to such property unless the

instrument is reduced to writing, signed by the executing party or their duly

authorized agent, and attested in the presence of a licensed notary public and two

or more witnesses simultaneously present. This statutory safeguard is not merely

procedural but substantive in nature, designed to prevent fraudulent dealings and

ensure legal certainty in transactions affecting immovable property. Accordingly,

any purported agreement or conveyance that fails to satisfy these requirements

cannot be enforced in law and must be deemed null and void ab initio.

Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance reads thus;

2. No sale, purchase, transfer, assignment, or mortgage of land or other

immovable property, and no promise, bargain, contract, or agreement for

effecting any such object, or for establishing any security, interest, or

incumbrance affecting land or other immovable property (other than a lease

at will, or for any period not exceeding one month), nor any contract or

agreement for the future sale or purchase of any land or other immovable

property, and no notice, given under the provisions of the Thesawalamai Pre-

emption Ordinance, of an intention or proposal to sell any undivided share or

interest in land held in joint or common ownership, shall be of force or avail in

law unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party making the

same, or by some person lawfully authorized by him or her in the presence of a

licensed notary public and two or more witnesses present at the same time, and

unless the execution of such writing, deed, or instrument be duly attested by

such notary and witnesses.

The rule of ‘Authenticity’, as articulated by E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in The Law

of Evidence (Vol. II, Book I (Stamford Lake Publication, 2022) page 70), refers to

the evidentiary requirement that a document must be shown to have been

genuinely written or executed by the person who purports to be its author or

signatory. In legal proceedings, authenticity is not presumed merely by the

Page 12 of 13

production of a document; rather, it must be affirmatively established when

challenged. This principle is reflected in Section 67 of the Evidence Ordinance,

which stipulates that when a document is alleged to bear the handwriting or

signature of a particular individual, the party relying on the document must

prove that the handwriting or signature is indeed that of the person in

question. (emphasis added)

The judicial approach to authenticity was clearly articulated in the case of Robins

v Grogan [43 N.L.R. 269 at 270], where the Court held that a document cannot

be admitted into evidence until its genuineness has either been admitted by the

opposing party or established through proof. The Court emphasized that such

proof must precede the acceptance of the document into the evidentiary record. In

situations where there is no admission regarding the execution of the document, it

becomes necessary to prove the handwriting or signature through reliable means.

The Notary has clearly stated in the attestation clause that he did not personally

know the executant, thereby necessitating calling the attesting witnesses to prove

due execution of the said Deeds. Since the 1st Respondent relies on the genuineness

of the two instruments, the burden of proof rests upon him to establish their

authenticity by calling the attesting witnesses. There is no evidence before Court of

the availability of the attesting witnesses at the trial stage. It is evident from the

proceedings dated 20/07/2016 that the 1st Respondent not only failed to discharge

that burden cast upon him but also abandoned the case even before the recording

of the Appellant’s evidence.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that, upon a consideration of the totality of

the evidence, the due execution of the Deed Nos. 4729 (marked P5) and 4730

(marked P6) have not been proved on a balance of probabilities; therefore, the said

Deeds are inadmissible in evidence. Accordingly, I answer the questions of law Nos.

1, 2, and 3 in the affirmative. As reasoned earlier in this Judgment, the question of

law No. 4 does not arise for consideration.

For the foregoing reasons, the Judgment dated 30/11/2020 delivered by the Civil

Appeal High Court is hereby set aside, and the Judgment of the Additional District

Judge dated 04/05/2018 is affirmed.

Appeal allowed. I make no order as to costs.
