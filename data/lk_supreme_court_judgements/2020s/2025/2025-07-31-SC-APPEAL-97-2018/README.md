PETITIONER-RESPONDENTS

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 121 of 152

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The subject matter of the instant application concerns an appeal from a judgment of

the Court of Appeal dated 19th December 20141, exercising its writ jurisdiction,

dismissing the application of the above-named Petitioner-Appellants, together with

the Petitioner-Respondents, to quash the Award of the Industrial Arbitrator

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 4th Respondent-Respondent) dated 16th

February 2010.

2. The 1st Respondent-Respondent is the Commissioner General of Labour, the 2nd

Respondent-Respondent is the Minister of Labour and Labour Relations, the 3rd

Respondent-Respondent is the employer, Maliban Biscuit Manufactories Limited, and

the 4th Respondent is Dr. Irvin Jayasooriya (now deceased), the Industrial Arbitrator

appointed by the 2nd Respondent-Respondent. The remaining Petitioner-Appellants,

Respondent-Respondents and Petitioner-Respondents are named in the caption

preceding this judgment, and such caption is replicated as submitted by the

Petitioners in the original Petition to the Supreme Court dated 30th January 2015.

3. The said Award was the result of arbitration proceedings bearing No. A 31312 held in

respect of the dispute between the Petitioner-Appellants and the 3rd Respondent-

Respondent abovenamed, Maliban Biscuit Manufactories Limited (hereinafter

referred to as the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company), that had been referred

for settlement by the 2nd Respondent under and in terms of Section 4(1) of the

Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended). The Award held that 558

workmen previously employed by the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company were

not terminated from employment but vacated their own posts by striking for a non-

industrial dispute, and on a balance of probabilities, are not entitled to relief.

1 Marked H. 2 Marked P1.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 122 of 152

4. Being aggrieved by the said Judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Petitioner-

Appellants appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted special leave to appeal on

20th June 2018 on the following questions of law set out in paragraphs 14(a), 14(b)

and 14(c) of the Petition dated 30th January 2015:

(a) Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to appreciate that the Petitioners

were engaged in a legal strike and hence did not have the animus or intention to

vacate their posts?

(b) Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to appreciate that the 4th

Respondent-Respondent has steped [sic] outside the terms of reference made by

the 2nd Respondent-Respondent?

(c) Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to appreciate that the 4th

Respondent-Respondent had acted outside his jurisdiction by coming to the

finding that the workmen including the Petitioners have vacated their post?

Facts according to the Petitioner

5. In the Petition, the Petitioner-Appellants have stated that they were permanent

employees of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company. During this period, the 3rd

Respondent-Respondent Company was the leading biscuit manufacturer in Sri Lanka

for several decades. By the end of 2003, however, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent

Company was operating at a loss of approximately Rs. 100 million and experiencing

a decline in its market share (said share falling to 30%).

6. On or about 23rd March 2004, a Collective Agreement3 was entered into in terms of

Section 12(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended) between

the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company and the registered Trade Union

(Semasahitha Maliban Kamanthashala Sewaka Samithiya) of the employees of the

Company, including the Petitioner-Appellants, before the Commissioner General of

Labour.

3 Marked A1 in the arbitration proceedings.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 123 of 152

7. In accordance with the above Collective Agreement, all employees, including the

Petitioner-Appellants, received significant salary increments and enhanced benefits.

In exchange, the employees and the Trade Union agreed to collectively and severally

render their efforts and contribute their fullest efforts to increase the productivity of

the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company.

8. Specifically, in terms of Clause 4 of the Collective Agreement, the 3rd Respondent

agreed to pay all its permanent employees three bonusesthe third bonus being

paid upon the Company making a net profit of Rs. 125 million.

9. In December 2004, the first and second bonuses were duly paid to the employees as

per the Collective Agreement by the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company. However,

the Petitioner-Appellants state that the achievement of a Rs. 125 million net profit,

upon which the third bonus was dependent, was an impossible target, according to

the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Companys own assessmentthe maximum target

that would be realistically realised was a net profit of Rs. 80 million in the financial

year of 2005/2006. As a result, the Company refused to grant the third bonus to its

employees, despite the employees and the Trade Union urging the Company to do

so.

10. Thereafter, on or about 15th June 2005, the Union filed a complaint4 with the

Commissioner General of Labour in respect of several disputes, including the dispute

pertaining to the non-payment of the third bonus. Pending the inquiry in relation to

such disputes before the Commissioner of Labour (Industrial Relations), a poster

campaign critical of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Companys Chief Executive

Officer (CEO), Mr. Keerthi Adhasuriya, and the Human Resources (HR) Manager, Mr.

Ajith Mahendra Fonseka, erupted in the premises of the Company, seemingly

suggesting an alleged link between the above two individuals and one Anura

4 Marked A4.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 124 of 152

Deshapriya, who had been taken into police custody for purportedly being connected

to the assassination of one Lieutenant Colonel Muthaleef of the Sri Lanka Army.

11. Additionally, on or about 27th June 2005, in response to the non-payment of the third

bonus and, according to the Petitioner-Appellants, the failure to honour several other

clauses of the Collective Agreement, the employees participated in a thirty-minute

protest during the lunch hour.

12. According to the Petitioner-Appellants, on 12th July 2005, the management of the 3rd

Respondent-Respondent Company decided to close the factory on the following day,

13th July 2005, and interdict 21 employees, 20 of whom were past and present office

bearers of the Trade Union, on the allegation that the said 21 employees had

threatened and intimidated the CEO and the Human Resources Manager of the

Company inside the office of the CEO.5 The Petitioner-Appellants contend that the

said 21 employees were interdicted without pay, prosecuted in the Magistrates Court,

and consequently dismissed from service by the 3rd Respondent-Respondent

Company. Furthermore, the Petition states that the Company alleged that the 558

workmen entered the factory premises on the day following the shutdown, 14th July

2005, and refused to work as well as leave the premises, until the workmen were

forcibly ejected by the Police on 18th July 2005.

13. Subsequently, according to the Petitioner-Appellants, by letter dated 08th August

20056 and addressed to 552 of the 558 above-referred workmen, the said employees

were informed of the termination of their services by the 3rd Respondent-Respondent

Company. It is the contention of the Petitioner-Appellants that the Company had thus

surreptitiously terminated approximately 80% of its total permanent workforce and

evaded its legal liability to pay compensation and other statutory dues to the

workmen.

5 The Notice dated 13th July 2005 interdicting the said 21 employees was produced in evidence marked A12. 6 Marked A21.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 125 of 152

14. Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent-Respondent (Minister of Labour Relations and Foreign

Employment), by reference dated 27th September 2005, referred the dispute for

settlement by arbitration, and appointed the 4th Respondent as the Industrial

Arbitrator for the proceedings. The Reference by the Minister spelt out the dispute as

follows:

!% )+ ,/ 024 )57 89+ = @ F

+ 8+ 558 J + K4 L2@ +

O, Q+ K R + %5 + ST V.

The English translation is provided herewith:

Whether the termination of the services of the Five Hundred and Fifty-Eight (558)

whose names are referred to in the attached schedule by the Maliban Biscuit

Manufacturers Limited is justified and if not what relief each of them is entitled.

15. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings, the 4th Respondent Industrial

Arbitrator, by Award dated 16th February 2010,7 held that the services of the workmen

(including the Petitioner-Appellants) were not terminated by the 3rd Respondent but

instead that the said workmen vacated their own posts by striking for a non-industrial

dispute. The 4th Respondent further held that, on a balance of probabilities, the

workmen were not entitled to any relief.

16. The Award was served on the Petitioner-Appellants by the Commissioner of Labour

with a letter dated 16th March 2010. In terms of Section 18(1) of the Industrial

Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended), the Commissioner published the said

Award in the Government Gazette (Extraordinary) No. 1643/41 dated 4th March

2010.8

7 Marked P3. 8 Copy of the publication of the Award is also marked P4.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 126 of 152

17. The Petitioner-Appellants assert that the aforesaid Award made by the 4th

Respondent is ultra vires the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, for reasons that

include, inter alia, the contention that the 4th Respondent acted in excess of his

jurisdiction in holding that the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company had not

terminated the services of the workmen in so far as the Reference by the Minister was

to determine whether the termination of the employees services is justified. Further,

the Petitioner-Appellants contend that the 4th Respondent failed to consider the

evidence and material placed before him, such as, according to the Petition, the fact

that there was no intention on the part of the employees to vacate their posts, that

the strike held by the employees was legal and justifiable, and that the Arbitrators

finding and subsequent Award was based on irrelevant considerations, whereas

relevant factors were not taken into consideration.

18. In light of such views, the Petitioner-Appellants filed a Petition dated 26th April 2010

to the Court of Appeal, praying for, inter alia,

(i) the granting of an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the

Award made by the 4th Respondent,

(ii) the granting of an order in the nature of a writ of mandamus directing the

4th Respondent to make an Award reinstating and/or granting just and

equitable compensation to the Petitioners whose services were terminated by

the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company,

(iii) and, as an alternative to (ii), the granting of an order in the nature of a writ

of mandamus directing the 4th Respondent to make an Award afresh, according

to law, in consideration of the evidence placed before the Arbitrator.

Facts according to the Respondents

19. According to the written submissions of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company

dated 07th March 2025, the terms of the Collective Agreement entered into between

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 127 of 152

the Petitioner-Appellants and the Company in so far as paying bonuses to the

workmen, were contingent upon the Company achieving the net profit targets. It is

admitted that, by reason of the employees contribution, renewed marketing strategies

and sound financial management, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company was

successful in achieving a net profit of 54.9 million by the end of June 2004. Accordingly,

the employees were duly paid the first and second bonuses in December 2004, in

compliance with the terms of the Collective Agreement.

20. However, as also admitted by the Petitioner-Appellants, the 3rd Respondent-

Respondent Company did not succeed in meeting the target net profit of Rs. 125

million, which was the contingency upon which the granting of the third bonus was

made. The 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company contends that, nevertheless, the

employees illegally and unlawfully demanded the third bonus which the Company

had rightfully refused in terms of the Collective Agreement.

21. As per Clause 40 of the Collective Agreement, the intervention of the Labour

Department was required for any interpretation or dispute arising out of matters

covered by said Agreement. Upon the Trade Unions submission of a complaint to the

Commissioner General of Labour following the Companys refusal to pay the third

bonus, the inquiry into the said disputes was scheduled to commence before the

Commissioner of Labour (Industrial Relations) on 5th July 2005. Pending such inquiry,

the 3rd Respondent-Respondent states that a poster campaign was organised by the

union from 18th to 20th June 2005, pertaining to the issue of the non-payment of the

bonus. As mentioned previously, the employees also engaged in a thirty-minute

protest during the lunch hour on or about 27th June 2005.

22. The 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company avers that both actions, the poster

campaign and the protest, amounted to Trade Union actions and were therefore

direct violations of Clauses 39 and 40 (reproduced in later sections of this judgment)

of the Collective Agreement, thereby manifestly constituting offences in terms of

Section 40 of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended).

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 128 of 152

23. At the inquiry before the Commissioner of Labour (Industrial Relations) on 5th July

2005, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company firmly asserted that the employees,

under and in terms of Clause 4 of the Collective Agreement, were not entitled to the

third bonus due to the failure to reach the net profit of Rs. 125 million.

24. In its written submissions, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent paints quite a grave

picture of the actions of the workmen in relation to the allegations surrounding the

Chief Executive Officer and the Human Resources Manager, who were falsely linked

to events surrounding the assassination of a Lieutenant Colonel of the Sri Lanka Army.

25. According to the Company, on 06th July 2005, a separate poster campaign was

orchestrated by the union within and outside the premises of the 3rd Respondent-

Respondent factory premises, suggesting links between the CEO and HR Manager of

the Company to one Anura Deshapriya, who had been taken into police custody on

suspicion of connection with the assassination of the Lieutenant Colonel.

26. Furthermore, by a letter dated 7th July 2006, the Union requested the Chairman of the

3rd Respondent-Respondent Company to remove the Chief Executive Officer and the

Human Resources Manager from their posts based on the aforementioned

allegations. The Chairman, categorically denying such allegations, requested the

employees to re-establish normalcy within the Company by letter dated 08th July

2005.9

27. It was subsequently confirmed by the Criminal Investigations Division (CID)10 that the

allegations in the said posters were, in fact, merely fabrications, and both individuals,

the Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources Manager of the Company, were

exonerated of any links to the murder of Lieutenant Colonel Muthalif or any other

related terrorist activities. Importantly, in any event, such issue was not an industrial

dispute in any manner or form. Further, the individual named Anura Deshapriya, to

9 Marked R2. 10 Marked R30.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 129 of 152

whom the CEO and HR Manager were purported to have links, was revealed to be

only a sub-contractor who had sub-contracted his employees to Golden Bank

(Private) Ltd, a subsidiary of Little Lion Associates (Pvt) Ltd, a private company owned

by the Chairman of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company. The management of

Golden Bake (Private) Ltd was handed over to a third party, namely the Edna Group,

during the period from 2001 to 2004.

28. According to the written submissions of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent, the

termination of the 21 employees was triggered by the actions of a mob led by one

Nishantha Pieris on 12th July 2005, a Trade Union leader and the main witness of the

Petitioner-Appellants in the arbitration proceedings, who purportedly entered the

CEOs room, threatened and intimidated the CEO and the HR Manager, and ultimately

forcibly ejected the two officers from the Company premises. Subsequently, the two

officers managed to leave the office premises under the protection of the Companys

Security Manager and filed a complaint at the Mount Lavinia Police Station on the

same day against the unprecedented and illegal acts of the employees.11

29. On the same evening, the Board of Directors of the 3rd Respondent met outside the

company premises and declared the following day, 13th July 2005, as a paid holiday

for all employees in order to facilitate investigations into the aforesaid incident. The

Board of Directors also decided to immediately suspend the services of the employees

who were directly involved in the poster campaign and the forcible eviction of the

two officers from the Company premises with immediate effect pending inquiry.

30. Thereafter, a disciplinary inquiry was held against the abovementioned 21 employees,

at the conclusion of which the services of all 21 employees were terminated. This

termination was challenged by the workmen in the Labour Tribunal of Ratmalana,

who affirmed that the said termination was just and equitable. Moreover, this finding

11 Marked R19.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 130 of 152

was subsequently upheld by the appellate courts. In fact, the said 21 employees were

also prosecuted before the Magistrates Court of Mount Lavinia.

31. After the resumption of operations at the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company

following the above incidents on 14th July 2005, a notice was displayed, barring the

aforementioned 21 employees from the company premises. However, contrary to the

instructions of the notice, the said 21 workmen entered the company premises and

persuaded the other employees to halt work and participate in an unlawful strike. As

per the 3rd Respondent-Respondent, all employees, including the Petitioner-

Appellants and the said 21 workmen, had struck work and unlawfully remained in the

company premises until 18th July 2005, a period during which they engaged in acts of

sabotage, intimidation and destruction.

32. The 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company also submitted that, as per the contents

of the posters that emerged during this period, the foremost demand of the

employees was to expel the Chief Executive Officer and the Human Resources

Manager from their posts due to their involvement in the events surrounding the

murder of a Lieutenant Colonel of the Sri Lanka Army and other terrorist activities. As

already established above, such allegations were proved to be baseless by the CID.

33. Ultimately, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company obtained an eviction order

from the Magistrates Court of Mount Lavinia and evicted only those 21 employees

from the company premises with the assistance of the fiscal of the Court, police and

the Companys security officers. However, according to the Company, when the 21

employees who were leading the mob were evicted, other workmen, including the

Petitioner-Appellants, also abandoned work and accompanied the aforesaid 21

individuals in gathering outside the Company premises.

34. Simultaneously, the inquiry pertaining to the non-payment of the third bonus before

the Commissioner of Labour (Industrial Relations) resumed on 18th July 2005.

However, the Company has stated that, in protest of the participation of the CEO and

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 131 of 152

Human Resources Manager in the inquiry, the representatives of the employees

refused to participate in the inquiry themselves. As a result, the Commissioner General

of Labour decided not to proceed further and to close the inquiry.

35. As narrated above, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company have submitted that,

when the aforementioned 21 employees were evicted upon order of the Magistrates

Court, all other employees, including the Petitioner-Appellants, also vacated the

premises and gathered outside the Companys office. When the Company re-opened

the following day, 19th July 2005, the employees who had left the Company premises

and assimilated outside, including the Petitioner-Appellants, were requested to report

back to work and resume operations. However, according to the 3rd Respondent-

Respondent, none of the employees complied with the request but instead continued

to remain outside the Company premises. In these circumstances, the Chairman and

the Board of Directors of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company, by letter dated

22nd July 2005,12 urged the family members of its employees, including those of the

Petitioner-Appellants, to request the said workmen to report back to work

considering the history of the Company and the impact of recommencing operation

to protect both their employment and the Company. In fact, certain senior officers of

the Company purportedly personally telephoned the employees, including some of

the Petitioner-Appellants, urging them to return back to work.

36. However, despite several such requests, most employees, including the Petitioner-

Appellants, did not return or report back to work at the Company. Consequently, by

letter dated 30th July 2005,13 the 3rd Respondent-Respondent provided an ultimatum

to the workmen: they were requested to resume their employment at the Company

on or before 05th August 2005, and should they fail to comply with such directions,

the company would be compelled to treat them as no longer having an interest in

continuing with employment and remove their names from the list of employees.

12 Marked R24. 13 Marked A16.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 132 of 152

37. After most of the said employees, including the Petitioner-Appellants, failed to

comply with the above directions by 5th August 2005, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent

Company aired public announcements on more than four occasions over the course

of the day, requesting them to report back to work before 5 pm and restore normalcy.

Most employees reacted to these announcements by displaying unruly behaviour

such as hooting and shouting when such announcements were aired.

38. Over the course of the time period between 19th July 2005 and 05th August 2005,

about 100 employees responded positively to the Companys efforts and reported

back to work, and for such employees, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent has assured

personal safety and protection of their employment without any impediments even

to date (at the time of the present application). However, 558 employees, inclusive of

the Petitioner-Appellants did not report back to work since 19th July 2005, thereby

conveying their disinterest in continuing with their employment as specified in R25.

39. Accordingly, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company, by letter R12, informed the

Petitioner-Appellants that their names had been removed from the list of employees

as specified in R25.

40. Upon a complaint made by the said 558 employees, the 2nd Respondent, holding the

office of the Minister of Labour Relations and Foreign Employment at the time,

referred the dispute for settlement by arbitration, and as already mentioned,

appointed the 4th Respondent as the Industrial Arbitrator to oversee the proceedings.

First Question of Law

41. The first question of law invites this Court to consider whether the Court of Appeal

erred in law by failing to appreciate that the Appellants were engaged in a legal strike

and hence did not have the animus or intention to vacate their posts.

42. The written submissions of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent lay down a descriptive

historical background pertaining to strikes. It is useful to reproduce some key legal

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 133 of 152

definitions, principles and case law developments to assist this Courts analysis of the

present case. As an apt preface to the discussion, the definition of the term strike

from the book titled Industrial Conflict by W. P. N. de Silva is elaborated as

follows:

The word strike appears to have come into usage during the latter part of the

eighteenth century and is said to be derived from the sailors term of striking the

mast in the sense of bringing the movement to a stop. In the non-legal sense, a

strike is the concerted cessation of work on the part of a body of workers for the

purpose of obtaining some concession from the employer.

43. In the legal arena, and more specifically, the statutory definitions, can be found first

in Section 2 of the Trade Union Ordinance No. 14 of 1935, which provides that a

strike means:

the cessation of work by a body of persons employed in any trade or industry

acting in combination, or concerted refusal, or a refusal under a common

understanding of any number of persons who are, or have been so employed, to

continue to work or to accept employment.

44. The development of strike action as a tool employed by the labour movement is

rooted in socialist ideology, shaping labour laws and industrial relations, and assisting

workers to secure better wages, working conditions and workers rights. However,

legal protection is afforded to a trade union and its members to engage in a legal

strike in furtherance of a trade dispute. Section 2 of the Trade Unions Ordinance

No. 14 of 1935 (as amended) defines a trade dispute as follows:

Trade dispute means any dispute or difference between employers and

workmen, or between workmen and workmen connected with the employment or

non-employment, or the terms of the employment, or with the conditions or

labour, of any person;

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 134 of 152

45. As such, stoppage of work during a strike by workers under common law amounts to

a breach of the employment contract, unless the strike is by members of a trade union

in the context of a trade dispute. As morefully, discussed below, even in the context

of a trade dispute, Section 40 of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as

amended) enumerates the instances in which a strike could be illegal where it is

conducted contrary to the provisions set out in Section 40(1).

46. In the present case, to determine the nature of the strike in which the Petitioner-

Appellants participated, it is pertinent to examine the specific Clauses in the Collective

Agreement.

47. Clause 39 of the Collective Agreement states that in the event an industrial dispute

arises during the subsistence of the Agreement, the employees and the union agree

to act in accordance with the Industrial Disputes Act prior to resorting to any trade

union action. Verbatim, the clause reads as follows:

X8Y Z[ \ OK9 ]5 Q2 @ Q[ [a

5@ Z ]2 b c ]5 Qe [ 8f8 0 L\ K4

[a 5@ + V.

48. Clause 40 of the Collective Agreement states that the parties agree to seek the

intervention of the Labour Department for any interpretation or upon any dispute in

respect of the said Agreement. Clause 40 is reproduced herewith:

X8Y ST OK9 ]2 i Q2 j[ Ok

]O+\V l[ m+ 8 b ]+ V.

49. As previously discussed, Clause 4 of the Collective Agreement, which entitles the

employees of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company to the third bonus upon the

satisfaction of the condition that the Company would reach the target of a Rs. 125

million or above net profit, reads as follows:

50. Section 40 of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended) provides for

offences that are punishable under the Act. In terms of such section:

(1) An person who

(a) being bound by a collective agreement or by a settlement under this Act or by

an award of an arbitrator or an Industrial Court, does any act or aids, abets or

incites the commission of any act in contravention of, fails to comply with, any of

the terms or conditions of that agreement, settlement or award;

[]

(e) being bound by a collective agreement or by a settlement under this Act or by

an award of an arbitrator or an Industrial Court and being a workman or a person

other than a workman, incites or induces a workman to strike or to discontinue

employment or work, with a view to procuring the alteration of any of the terms

and conditions of that agreement, settlement or award;

(f) being bound by a collective agreement or by a settlement under this Act or by

an award of an arbitrator or an Industrial Court and being a workman, takes part

in a strike or discontinues employment or work, with a view to procuring the

alteration of any of the terms and conditions of that agreement, settlement or

award;

[]

shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 136 of 152

51. Despite the knowledge that the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company did not

achieve the target net profit value which would trigger the granting of the third bonus,

not only did the Petitioner-Appellants unjustifiably demand for such bonus but also

engaged in strike action as well as launch a poster campaign on the issue of the non-

payment of the bonus mere 03 days from the filing of the complaint with the

Commissioner General of Labour by letter dated 15th June 2005.14

52. The fact that the subject matter of the poster campaign was the issue of the non-

payment of the third bonus is admitted in the evidence of the Trade Union leader,

one Nishantha Peiris, who was called on behalf of the Union as the first witness at the

arbitration proceedings:

53. In the written submissions dated 07th March 2025, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent

submits the following extract from Misconduct in Employment (In Public and

Private Section) by B. R. Ghaiye, Eastern Book Co. which states the following on

the issue of the legality of a strike:

When a strike is illegal when we say that a strike is illegal what we mean is

that the strike is in violation of some provisions contained in the State. Such

statutory provisions are either Acts passed by the Legislature such as the Industrial

Disputes Act or the Acts made by the State. Whenever, the strike contravenes the

provisions or any Statute, the strike must be held to be illegal.16

54. Sansoni J., in Ceylon Bank Employees Union v. Yatawara,17 quoted the following

passed from the judgment of Patanjali Sastri C. J. in the case of The State of Madras

v. C. P. Sarathy and another:18

In view of the increasing complexity of modern life and the interdependence of

the various sectors of planned national economy, it is obviously in the interests of

the public that labour disputes should be peacefully and quickly settled within the

framework of the Act rather than by resort to methods of direct action which are

only too well calculated to disturb public peace and order and diminish

production in the country, and Courts should not be astute to discover formal

defects and technical flaws to overthrow such settlements.

55. In the present case, the Petitioner-Appellants have undoubtedly violated Clauses 39

and 40 of the Collective Agreement by engaging in activities such as the strike and

launching the poster campaign. In turn, by violating such terms, the Petitioner-

Appellants are also in contravention of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act,

specifically Sections 14(a), 14(e) and 14(f) of the Statute. Furthermore, the strike in

16 B. R. Ghaiye, Misconduct in Employment (In Public and Private Sectors) (2nd edn, Eastern Book Co., 1977) at p. 427. 17 64 NLR 49. 18 AIR (1953) S.C. 83.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 138 of 152

question was held pending the inquiry before the Commissioner of Labour (Industrial

Relations) pertaining to the same issuethe culmination of these factors assigns an

illegal nature to the strike.

56. In relation to the subsequent poster campaign launched on the subject matter of the

alleged links between the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources

Manager and the events surrounding the death of the Lieutenant Colonel Muthalif, it

is largely clear that such dispute does not fall within the bounds of a trade dispute.

57. The same witness, Nishantha Peiris, categorically admits to this and further to the fact

that the allegations were baseless:

59. In written submissions dated 7th March 2005, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent has

submitted that the Petitioner-Appellants, by virtue of the Trade Union action

demanding the expulsion of the Chief Executive Officer and the Human Resources

19 At pp. 144-146 of the brief.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 140 of 152

Manager, are not afforded immunity from legal action provided for by the Trade

Unions Ordinance No. 14 of 1935 (as amended).

60. Section 26 of the Trade Unions Ordinance grants limited immunity from civil actions

and tortious liabilities to a trade union or any officer/member in respect of an act

done in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute. The provision reads:

No action or other legal proceeding shall be maintainable in any civil court

against any registered trade union or any officer or member thereof in respect of

any act done in contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute to which a

member of the trade union is a party on the ground only that such act induces

some other person to break a contract of employment, or that it is in interference

with the trade, business or employment of some other person or with the right of

some other person to dispose of his capital or of his labour as he wills.

61. I find no reason to disagree with the position of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent in

that the Petitioner-Appellants are not eligible to enjoy protection guaranteed under

the Trade Unions Ordinance by reason that the demand to expel the two officers due

to baseless allegations purporting a connection to fictional terrorist activities is, in

fact, outside the strict limits of a trade dispute.

62. Another extract that was submitted from Misconduct in Employment (In Public and

Private Sector) by B. R. Ghaiye, Eastern Book Co. reads:

Strike to be justified should be launched for economic demands the first and

foremost requirement of a justified strike is that it should be launched only for

economic demands of the workmen like basic pay, dearness allowance, bonus,

provident fund, gratuity, leave and holidays, etc. which are the primary objects of

a trade union. The strike is justified only if it is connected with the current labour

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 141 of 152

disputes. If a strike is launched for political reasons and not for any trade union

object, the strike is not justified.20

63. In the development of legal principles surrounding a strike, judge-made law has

established that conducting a strike for purposes other than an industrial dispute can

render the strike unjustified, thereby providing the employer with the liberty to take

appropriate action against such strikers. In the landmark case of Best Footwear (Pvt)

Ltd v. Aboosally,21 notwithstanding that a strike is legal in nature, the strike may be

deemed unjustifiable due to reasons such as the primary purpose of the strike being

to embarrass the employer rather than to address legitimate grievances. Further, the

case elaborated that the weapon of a strike ought to be used only as a last resort

where all other avenues for the settlement of the industrial dispute have proved to be

futile and fruitless. Commenting on the economic effect of a strike, Jayasuriya J. stated

that:

It is a trite proposition that since the commencement and the continuance of a

strike has an adverse effect upon production and upon the industry and because

it may ultimately lead to a closure of m manufacturing establishments, this

weapon of a strike ought to be used as a last resort when all other avenues for

settlement of industrial disputes have proved to be futile and fruitless. In the

circumstances, Courts of law by their orders ought to discourage the misuse of

strikes and to control and minimise the deleterious and harmful consequences of

its misuse in respect of industries as far as possible so that the economy of the

country would not be adversely affected. I hold that the strike in this case has not

been utilised as a last resort and this hasty and ill-considered decision to strike

has caused cessation of production, considerable financial loss and detriment to

the employer and an adverse effect on the economy of the country22

20 B. R. Ghaiye, Misconduct in Employment (In Public and Private Sectors) (2nd edn, Eastern Book Co., 1977) at p. 414. 21 (1997) 2 S.L.R. 137 (CA). 22 Ibid at p. 151.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 142 of 152

64. In the present case, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company has submitted that, at

the inquiry held before the Commissioner of Labour on 05th July 2005, the Chief

Executive Officer and Human Resources Manager of the Company firmly took up the

position that the employees were not entitled to the third bonus by reason that the

target net profit was not satisfied. This, according to the 3rd Respondent-Respondent,

caused a rift between the employees, the Trade Union and the two officers of the

Company. As a result of this disagreement, the Union, from 06th July 2005 onwards,

conducted a poster campaign on an entirely new issue targeting the Chief Executive

Officer and the Human Resources Manager for alleged links to the assassination of

Muthalif. The subsequent actions of the members of the Trade Unionin demanding

the expulsion of the two officers by letter dated 07th July 2006,23 launching a poster

campaign publicising the aforesaid allegations which were confirmed to be fabricated

and baseless, and leading a mob to enter the Chief Executive Officers office to

threaten, intimidate and evict the two officersare indicative of the fact that the

employees deviated from the original dispute over the third bonus to an issue that

cannot be classified as a trade dispute and has no relevance to their employment

whatsoever.

65. Thus, I answer the first half of the first question of law in the negative; the Court of

Appeal did not err in law by failing to appreciate that the Appellants were engaged in

a legal strike.

66. The second half of the question of law requires this Court to consider whether, by

failing to appreciate that the Appellants were engaged in a legal strike, the Court of

Appeal erred in law by affirming that the Petitioner-Appellants had the animus or

intention to vacate their posts.

23 Marked R2.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 143 of 152

67. In the case of Building Materials Corporation v. Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya,24

Perera J held,

Where an employee endeavours to keep away from work or refuses or fails to

report to work or duty without an acceptable excuse for a reasonably long period

of time such conduct would necessarily be a group which justifies the employer

to consider the employee as having vacated service.

68. The Court of Appeal laid down the two elements, physical and mental, that need to

be proven to establish vacation of post in Nelson de Silva v. Sri Lanka State

Engineering Corporation:25

The concept of vacation of post involves two aspects. One is the mental element

that is the intention to desert and abandon the employment while the second is

the failure to report at the workplace of the employee. To constitute the first

element; it must be established that the employee not reporting at the workplace,

was actuated by an intention to voluntarily vacate his employment.

The physical absence and the mental element should co-exist for there to be a

vacation of post in law. A temporary absence from a place does not mean that

the place is abandoned; there must be shown also an intention not to return. So

to the physical failure to perform a contractual duty there must be added the

intention to abandon future performance. A reasonable explanation may

negative the intention to abandon. A bona fide challenge to the validity of an

order is a satisfactory expiation for not complying with it. By challenging the order

the complainant was affirming the contract not abandoning it.26

69. The 3rd Respondent-Respondent cited the case of Nandasena v. Uva Regional

Transport Board (supra) also in support of the principle that a failure to comply with

24 (1993) 2 SLR 316 at p.322. 25 (1996) 2 S.L.R. 342. 26 At p. 342.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 144 of 152

a bona fide order of the employer is a deliberate and calculated act of disobedience

and a virtual repudiation of his contract. It is the position of the 3rd Respondent-

Respondent Company that by refraining from their official duties, engaging in an

illegal and unjustified strike (from the 14th of July till 05th August 2005) and failing to

report to work despite numerous attempts by the Company to resume operations,

the Petitioner-Appellants have failed to comply with a bona fide order of the Company

in an act of deliberate disobedience which translates to an intention to abandon their

contract of employment.

70. In the case of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Jathika Sevaka

Sangamaya,27 it was concluded by the Court that,

An employee who is transferred as a punishment, consequent to the finding at a

domestic inquiry, has to first obey it and comply with the transfer order and then

complain against it by way of an appeal. The failure to report at the place to

which he is transferred and keeping away from work, without obtaining leave to

cover his absence from work, is a calculated act of disobedience and by his own

conduct, secures his own discharge from the contract of employment with his

employer.

[]

On the facts of this case, the workman, by his own conduct, had got himself

discharged from his contract of employment after a period of service during which

his continued attitude had been to have his own way in defiance of lawful orders,

warnings and directions given by the management.28

71. Indeed, several ultimatums were provided to the Petitioner-Appellants prior to the

final letter R12, which informed the Petitioner-Appellants that their names had been

deleted from the list of employees subsequent to their due to a lack of show of

interest in remaining employed by the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company. These

27 2011 2. S.L.R. 28 At p. 122-125.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 145 of 152

ultimatums include numerous official and personal requests, a direction to work on

or before 05th August 2005, and several public announcements to the gathering of

employees outside the Company premises after non-compliance with the said

direction. It is my view that this does, in fact, satisfy both the physical and mental

elements necessary to establish vacation of post, especially in the background of the

knowledge that the Petitioner-Appellants did not, at any juncture, provide an

explanation as to why they were refraining from resumption of work nor did they

challenge the validity of the ultimatum given by the 3rd Respondent-Respondent.

72. As such, the second half of the first question of law, too, is also answered in the

negative.

Second and Third Questions of Law

73. The next question of law requires this Court to consider whether the Court of Appeal

erred in law by failing to appreciate that the 4th Respondent-Respondent (the

Industrial Arbitrator) has stepped outside the terms of reference made by the 2nd

Respondent-Respondent (the Minister of Labour and Labour Relations). The final

question of law invites this Court to consider whether the learned Judges of the Court

of Appeal erred in law by failing to appreciate that the 4th Respondent-Respondent

had acted outside his jurisdiction by coming to the finding that the workmen,

including the Petitioner-Appellants, had vacated their posts. As the second and third

questions of law concern the bounds of the Reference by the Minister within which

the Arbitrator is given the autonomy to act, and the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator, these

two questions will be dealt with together.

74. In written submissions dated 07th March 2025, the Petitioner-Appellants have

submitted that the Arbitrators Award is ultra vires the Ministers terms of reference.

According to the Petitioner-Appellants, the issue to be determined by the 4th

Respondent-Respondent was whether or not the termination of the services was

justified. However, it is contended that the Arbitrator exceeded the mandate given by

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 146 of 152

the Terms of Reference in deciding that the services of the workers have not been

terminated by the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company, but that the employees

themselves have vacated their posts. As the Arbitrator derives jurisdiction from the

Reference, and the Arbitrators jurisdiction is limited to the dispute spelt out in such

Reference, the argument is that the findings of the Arbitrator are outside the 4th

Respondent-Respondents jurisdiction and, therefore, ultra vires.

75. The written submissions of the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondents dated 19th

February 2025 address this by stating that, following the Reference dated 26th

September 2005, both parties submitted their respective Statements to the Arbitrator,

and the Statement of the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company, the employer,

categorically denied termination, and stated that the Petitioner-Appellants had

vacated their posts. In parallel, the Statement of the Petitioner-Appellants, the

employees, denied, inter alia, vacation of post, asserting that there had been a

termination of the services of the said employees.

76. The 1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondents submit that, therefore, both parties had

evidently identified the dispute to be resolved by way of arbitration based on the

Reference by the Minister and further that the dispute itself centered around the

question of whether the employees had vacated their posts, and if not, what relief

they were entitled to receive. It is, according to the Respondents, upon the

identification of the dispute that the Arbitrator is required to make a decision based

on the Reference.

77. Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act empowers the Minister to, inter alia, refer

an industrial dispute to an Arbitrator for settlement by arbitration. The provision

reads:

(1) The Minister may, if he is of the opinion that an industrial dispute is a minor

dispute, refer it, by an order in writing, for settlement by arbitration to an

arbitrator appointed by the Minister or to a labour tribunal, notwithstanding that

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 147 of 152

the parties to such dispute or their representatives do not consent to such

reference.

78. As already established, on 26th September 2005, the then Minister of Labour Relations

and Foreign Employment referred the dispute between the parties in the present case

for arbitration in terms of Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act in the following

manner:

Whether the termination of the services of the Five Hundred and Fifty-Eight (558)

whose names are referred to in the attached schedule by the Maliban Biscuit

Manufacturers Limited is justified and if not what relief each of them is entitled.

79. The 1st and 2nd Respondents have submitted that, having regard to Section 4(1) of the

Act, the Minister cannot himself decide that the employees were terminated, as the

powers conferred upon the Minister by Section 4(1) are to refer the dispute for

settlement by arbitration, and therefore, it is implicit that the question couched in the

aforementioned Reference was whether or not the employees were terminated. It has

been further submitted that the Arbitrator, having regard to the evidence and material

placed before him, concluded that the employer had not terminated the services of

the employees but rather that the employees had vacated their posts owing to their

conduct.

80. I find no reason to deviate from the reasoning provided by the learned Judges of the

Court of Appeal in the judgment that is the subject matter of the present appeal

before this Court. The appellate Court arrived at the following conclusion:

The petitioners who kept away from work were sent letters to their houses to

report back to work on the 5th of August 2005, but they have kept away from

work and the 3rd respondent company has sent the vacation of post letters on the

8th of August three days after the date they were asked to resume work. The

petitioners' counsel mentioned about the concept of vacation of post which is the

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 148 of 152

mental element and the physical element failed he said as the petitioners did not

intend to keep away from work therefore the mental element fails. Petitioners

even after the 3rd respondent sent letters to resume work did not respond which

show they did not want to report back to work. Therefore, the petitioners cannot

say there was no mental element

The petitioners argument was that the 2nd respondent's reference to the 4th

respondent was to see the termination of services was justified or not and not to

decide whether there has been a termination. To go into this he had to see what

led to the termination, by doing so he had come to the conclusion that there was

no termination but the petitioners have kept away without resuming work when

asked to report, thereby they have vacated their posts. This is not ultra vires the

4th respondent has acted within the reference given to him by the Minister. One

cannot say the 4th respondent exceeded his powers.

Petitioners at the inquiry have not objected to the 4th respondent taking up the

issue of termination of work therefore they now cannot say the 4th respondent

acted in excess of jurisdiction.29

81. On a plain reading of the Ministers Reference, it is evident that the question

presupposes the existence of a termination of services and invites the Arbitrator to

determine whether such termination was justified. The Petitioner-Appellants argue

that the Arbitrator cannot, in such a case, side-step this underlying assumption and

conclude that there was, in fact, no termination at all, but rather, that the employees

themselves vacated their posts.

82. However, this submission, when tested against both the evidentiary record and the

statutory purpose of industrial arbitration, must be carefully scrutinised. The purpose

of referring a dispute to arbitration under Section 4(1) is to achieve a binding

29 At p.7-8.

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 149 of 152

determination of an industrial dispute, as defined in Section 48 of the Act. Section 48

of the Industrial Disputes Act defines an industrial dispute in the following manner:

industrial dispute means any dispute or difference between an employer and a

workman or between employers and workmen or between workmen and

workmen connected with the employment or non-employment, or the terms of

employment, or with the conditions of labour, or the termination of the services,

or the reinstatement in service, of any person, and for the purposes of this

definition workmen includes a trade union consisting of workmen;

83. The jurisdiction conferred on the Arbitrator by the Reference does not operate in a

vacuum. In the present case, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent employer, in its

Statement before the Arbitrator, clearly denied that there had been any termination

on its part and instead took the position that the employees had vacated their posts.

In response, the employees denied having vacated their posts and insisted that there

was an unjustified termination. Thus, it became necessary for the Arbitrator, in

deciding whether the termination was justified, to first determine whether there had

in fact been a termination at all.

84. Was there a termination of services?This preliminary question cannot be

construed as falling outside the scope of the Reference. Rather, it is a logical and

necessary step in assessing the very issue referred for arbitration. To determine

whether a termination is justified, one must first determine whether a termination

has occurred. Where the Arbitrator finds, based on the totality of the evidence, that

no termination was effected by the employer, but that the employees voluntarily

absented themselves and thereby vacated their posts, such a finding cannot be

considered to exceed the jurisdiction conferred by the Reference. It is a finding on the

merits that disposes of the core question: whether the employer is liable for wrongful

termination. If the answer is that no termination occurred, the question of justification

becomes moot.

85. Furthermore, it is not insignificant that at no point during the arbitral proceedings did

the Petitioner-Appellants object to the framing of the dispute in these terms or

challenge the Arbitrators authority to consider whether a termination had, in fact,

occurred. As the Court of Appeal correctly observed, parties cannot remain silent

during the arbitration and subsequently challenge the Arbitrators jurisdiction once

an unfavourable award is rendered. The principle of acquiescence, rooted in

procedural fairness and good faith, bars such belated objections.

86. In this respect, the Court of Appeal rightly recognised that the Arbitrators finding that

the employees vacated their posts was not ultra vires but rather within the legitimate

scope of determining whether the employers actions amounted to a termination and

whether any relief was warranted. The interpretation advanced by the Petitioner-

Appellants would, in my opinion, artificially narrow the Arbitrators fact-finding

function and undermine the purpose of the dispute resolution mechanism

contemplated by the Act.

87. Accordingly, this Court finds no merit in the submission that the Arbitrator exceeded

his jurisdiction or acted outside the terms of the Ministers Reference. The Arbitrator

remained within the jurisdiction conferred upon him and rendered a reasoned Award

based on the factual matrix placed before him. There is no basis to disturb the

reasoning of the Court of Appeal in this regard.

88. As such, I answer the penultimate and final questions of law in the negative. Further,

given the contextual background to this case, it is, in my view, pertinent to make

certain observations. It is often rightly stated that the modern function of labour law

is to serve as a vehicle for protecting the employee, who is typically the economically

weaker party in the employment relationship. However, this protective function must

not be misconstrued as a licence to disregard the legitimate interests of the employer.

Labour law is not, and was never intended to be, a unilateral instrument of redress.

Rather, it is a carefully calibrated framework intended to strike a balance between the

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 151 of 152

rights and obligations of both employers and employees, in the wider interest of

industrial harmony, economic stability, and social justice.

89. It is my firm opinion that the employer must not be viewed merely as a party to be

restrained, but rather as a stakeholder that must also be protected when required.

The inescapable reality is that the existence of an employee is inextricably linked to

the survival of the employer. A viable employer sustains employment, contributes to

the national economy, and serves as the foundation upon which the rights of

employees can be meaningfully realised. Without an employer, there is no

employment relationship to regulate or protect.

90. The conduct of the employees in this case, particularly in the events leading to the

second strike, falls egregiously short of the standard expected in a lawful and

responsible industrial environment. As discussed, the subject matter of the second

strike bore no legitimate connection to any existing industrial dispute. Rather, it was

an unprovoked attempt to assert control over the management and operation of the

enterprise, in a manner wholly incompatible with the law and the principles of orderly

industrial relations.

91. Such conduct cannot be condoned under the guise of exercising labour rights. The

right to strike and to protest must always be exercised within the boundaries of law

and good faith. When employees take it upon themselves to effectively usurp

management's functions, obstruct operations, and endanger the continued viability

of the undertaking, they not only place their own employment at risk but also

jeopardise the livelihoods of others who depend on the employers continued

functioning.

92. This is not the use, purpose, or legislative intent underpinning labour law. The

legislature did not conceive of labour law as an instrument of industrial sabotage or

corporate destabilisation. The statutory framework is designed to facilitate

conciliation, promote mutual respect, and ensure a fair resolution of grievances, rather

SC Appeal 97/2018 JUDGMENT Page 152 of 152

than permitting the destruction of enterprises through acts of economic coercion or

insubordination.

93. Therefore, the policy foundation must be one of mutual recognition and restraint: live

and let live. The law must continue to protect the vulnerable employee, but not at the

expense of the legitimate functioning and sustainability of the employer. In this

context, the conduct of the employees, as revealed in the evidence, is not only

unacceptable but fundamentally inimical to the spirit of the Industrial Disputes Act

and the broader aims of labour jurisprudence in this jurisdiction.

94. The appeal of the Petitioner-Appellants is thereby dismissed. The Petitioner-

Appellants are directed to pay Rs. 10,000 each as legal costs to the 3rd Respondent-

Respondent Company, Maliban Biscuit Manufactories Limited. Such costs are to be

paid within 6 months of this direction.

Appeal Dismissed.
