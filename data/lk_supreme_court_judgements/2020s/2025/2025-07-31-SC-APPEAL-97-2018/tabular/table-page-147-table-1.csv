"78.  As already established, on 26th September 2005, the then Minister of Labour Relations",""
"","and Foreign Employment referred the dispute between the parties in the present case"
"","for arbitration in terms of Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act in the following"

"","Act, the Minister cannot himself decide that the employees were terminated, as the"
