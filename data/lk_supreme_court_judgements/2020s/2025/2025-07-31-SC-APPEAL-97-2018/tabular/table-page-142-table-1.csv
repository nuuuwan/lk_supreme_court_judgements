"64.","In the present case, the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company has submitted that, at"
"","the  inquiry  held  before  the  Commissioner  of  Labour  on  05th  July  2005,  the  Chief"
"","Executive Officer and Human Resources Manager of the Company firmly took up the"
"","position that the employees were not entitled to the third bonus by reason that the"
"","target net profit was not satisfied. This, according to the 3rd Respondent-Respondent,"
"","caused  a  rift  between  the  employees,  the  Trade  Union  and  the  two  officers  of  the"
"","Company. As a result of this disagreement, the Union, from 06th July 2005 onwards,"
"","conducted a poster campaign on an entirely new issue targeting the Chief Executive"
"","Officer and the Human Resources Manager for alleged links to the assassination of"
"","Muthalif. The subsequent actions of the members of the Trade Union—in demanding"
"","the expulsion of the two officers by letter dated 07th July 2006,23 launching a poster"
"","campaign publicising the aforesaid allegations which were confirmed to be fabricated"
"","and  baseless,  and  leading  a  mob  to  enter  the  Chief  Executive  Officer’s  office  to"
"","threaten,  intimidate  and  evict  the  two  officers—are  indicative  of  the  fact  that  the"
"","employees deviated from the original dispute over the third bonus to an issue that"
"","cannot be classified as a “trade dispute” and has no relevance to their employment"
"","whatsoever."
