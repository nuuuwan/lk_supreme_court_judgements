"7.","In  accordance  with  the  above  Collective  Agreement,  all  employees,  including  the"
"","Petitioner-Appellants, received significant salary increments and enhanced benefits."
"","In exchange, the employees and the Trade Union agreed to collectively and severally"
"","render their efforts and contribute their fullest efforts to increase the productivity of"
"","the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company."
"8.","Specifically,  in  terms  of  Clause  4  of  the  Collective  Agreement,  the  3rd  Respondent"
"","agreed  to  pay  all  its  permanent  employees  three  bonuses—the  third  bonus  being"
"","paid upon the Company making a net profit of Rs. 125 million."
"9.","In December 2004, the first and second bonuses were duly paid to the employees as"
"","per the Collective Agreement by the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company. However,"
"","the Petitioner-Appellants state that the achievement of a Rs. 125 million net profit,"
"","upon which the third bonus was dependent, was an impossible target, according to"
"","the 3rd Respondent-Respondent Company’s own assessment—the maximum target"
"","that would be realistically realised was a net profit of Rs. 80 million in the financial"
"","year of 2005/2006. As a result, the Company refused to grant the third bonus to its"
"","employees, despite the employees and the Trade Union urging the Company to do"
"","so."
