"85.  Furthermore, it is not insignificant that at no point during the arbitral proceedings did",""
"","the  Petitioner-Appellants  object  to  the  framing  of  the  dispute  in  these  terms  or"
"","challenge  the  Arbitrator’s  authority  to  consider  whether  a  termination  had,  in  fact,"
"","occurred.  As  the  Court  of  Appeal  correctly  observed,  parties  cannot  remain  silent"
"","during the arbitration and subsequently challenge the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction once"
"","an  unfavourable  award 
is 
rendered.  The  principle  of  acquiescence, 
rooted 
in"
"","procedural fairness and good faith, bars such belated objections."
"86.","In this respect, the Court of Appeal rightly recognised that the Arbitrator’s finding that"
"","the employees vacated their posts was not ultra vires but rather within the legitimate"
"","scope of determining whether the employer’s actions amounted to a termination and"
"","whether  any  relief  was  warranted.  The  interpretation  advanced  by  the  Petitioner-"
"","Appellants  would, 
in  my  opinion,  artificially  narrow  the  Arbitrator’s  fact-finding"
"","function 
and  undermine 
the  purpose  of 
the  dispute 
resolution  mechanism"
"","contemplated by the Act."
