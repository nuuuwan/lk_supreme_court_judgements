"Private Section) by B. R. Ghaiye, Eastern Book Co. which states the following on"
"the issue of the legality of a strike:"
"“When a strike is illegal – when we say that a strike is illegal what we mean is"
"that  the  strike  is  in  violation  of  some  provisions  contained  in  the  State.  Such"
"statutory provisions are either Acts passed by the Legislature such as the Industrial"
"Disputes Act or the Acts made by the State. Whenever, the strike contravenes the"
"provisions or any Statute, the strike must be held to be illegal.”16"
