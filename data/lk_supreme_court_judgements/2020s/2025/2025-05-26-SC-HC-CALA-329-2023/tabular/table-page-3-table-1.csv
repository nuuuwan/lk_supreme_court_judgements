"M
urdu N.B. Fernando, PC, CJ.,"
"01. We  have  heard  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  and  the  Respondent"
"exhaustively."
"02. We appreciate the submissions made by Mr. Chandaka Jayasundere, PC on behalf of the"
"Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner  (“Petitioner”)  that  the  Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent"
"(“Respondent”) has failed to  establish  a contractual relationship between the Petitioner"
"and the Respondent. Mr. Jayasundere, PC contended, that the failure of the Respondent to"
"annex and produce the contract of re-insurance entered between the Sri Lanka Insurance"
"Corporation and the National Insurance Corporation was fatal for the maintainability of"
"the  instant  application  and  therefore,  the  dismissal  of  the  action  by  the  trial  court  was"
"correct and justified. Further, it was contended on behalf of the Petitioner, that the setting"
"aside  of  the  trial  court  judgement  by  the  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  of  the  Western"
"Province (“the High Court”), was erroneous and moved that it be revised and set aside."
"Mr. Nigel Hatch, PC on behalf of the Respondent, strenuously argued that the Petitioner"
"cannot  maintain  this  Special  Leave  to  Appeal  application  upon  merits  and  also  on  the"
"principle of Res Judicata, as this Court has examined the matters in issue and rejected the"
"Special Leave to Appeal Application in a connected matter between the very same parties."
