"n Theivandran v Ramanathan Che(cid:427)ar [(1986)] 2 Sri LR 219; at page 222], Chief Jus(cid:415)ce"
"Sharvananda stated as follows:"
"“In a vindicatory ac(cid:415)on the claimant need merely prove two facts; namely, that he is"
"the owner of the thing and that the thing to which he is en(cid:415)tled to possession by"
"virtue of his ownership is in the possession of the defendant. Basing his claim on his"
"ownership, which en(cid:415)tles him to possession,  he may sue for the ejectment  of any"
"person  in  possession  of  it  without  his  consent.  Hence  when  the  legal  (cid:415)tle  to  the"
"premises is admi(cid:425)ed or proved to be in the plain(cid:415)ﬀ, the burden of proof is on the"
"defendant to show that he is in lawful possession.” [emphasis added]"
