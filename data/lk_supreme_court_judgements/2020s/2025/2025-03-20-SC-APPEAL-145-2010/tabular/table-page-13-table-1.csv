he learned President’s Counsel for the Defendants submi(cid:425)ed that the total extent of the"
"land owned by the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ is only 4.7P and that the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ has encroached on to the"
"adjoining land of the 1st Defendant,  that being Lot No. 172 of  V3.  This submission was"
"based on Plan No. 3644 [V2] prepared by S. Ranchagoda who has surveyed Lot No. 172"
"on 23rd September 1996. According to V2, the total extent of the land claimed by the 1st"
"Defendant is 1R 24.2P which is 1.5P more than the extent of 1R 22.7P shown in V3 and"
"referred to in the schedule to the answer. Even though it is claimed in the surveyor’s report"
"[V2a] that the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ has encroached on the northern part of the land claimed by the 1st"
"Defendant with the extent of such encroachment being 1.3P, that cannot be for the reason"
"that  according  to  V2,  the  extent  of  Lot  No.  172  has  increased  by  1.5P.  This  increase  is"
"almost iden(cid:415)cal to the disputed extent claimed by the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ."
"P
rior to V2, Lot No. 172 was surveyed on 26th July 1991 – vide V5. While V5 sets out 4 lots,"
"the extent of all four lots is given as 1R 22.7P which is iden(cid:415)cal to the extent of Lot No."
"172 given in the schedule to the answer. V5 shows three encroachments on the western"
"boundary the  total  extent  of  which  is 3.25P.  What  is cri(cid:415)cal is  that  while  the  northern"
"boundary is shown as Lot No. 152, no encroachments have been shown on the disputed"
"northern boundary nor does the surveyor claim that the extent of the land is less than"
"what  it  was  in  1923.  In  other  words,  in  terms  of  V5  produced  by  the  Defendants,  the"
"Plain(cid:415)ﬀ has not encroached on to the land claimed by the 1st Defendant."
"T
he land of the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ was surveyed on 11th September 1995 by M. Rajasekeran pursuant"
"to a Commission issued by Court - vide Plan No. 3516 [X]. According to the Surveyor’s"
"Report [Y] a(cid:425)ached to ‘X’, Lot No. 5 in P2 has been super imposed on ‘X’. While the total"
"extent of the land of the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ has remained at 6P, ‘X’ shows the encroachment by the"
"Defendants as being 1.1P in extent, leaving the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ with only 4.9P. What is important"
"is that the said encroachment is within the southern boundary of the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ’s land. With"
"the  extent  of  the  Plain(cid:415)ﬀ’s  land  remaining  sta(cid:415)c,  it  is  clear  that  the  Defendants  have"
"encroached on to the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ’s land."
