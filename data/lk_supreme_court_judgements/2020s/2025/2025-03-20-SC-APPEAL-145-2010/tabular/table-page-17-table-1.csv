"T
he High Court came to the above conclusion in spite of P12 having been executed in 1931"
"and P1 in 1963, and in spite of P1 and P12 having been marked without any objec(cid:415)on"
"during the trial. In arriving at such conclusion, the High Court has clearly disregarded the"
"provisions of Sec(cid:415)on 90 of the Evidence Ordinance. I am therefore of the view that the"
"High Court clearly erred when it held that P1 and P12 have not been proved. In any event,"
"the High Court has completely disregarded the prescrip(cid:415)ve (cid:415)tle of the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ, on which"
"the Plain(cid:415)ﬀ was en(cid:415)tled to succeed."
