"save that it has to take second place."
"In Lairis Appu v. Tennakoon Kumarihamy (61 N.L.R. 97 at 105) Sinnetamby, J., held that:"
"“Our Registration Ordinance provides for the registration of documents and not"
"for the registration of titles. If it had been the latter, then, from whatever source"
"the title was derived, registration by itself would give title to the transferee. When,"
"however,  provision  is  made  only  for  the  registration  of  documents  of  title,  the"
"object in its simplest form, is to safeguard a purchaser from a fraud that may be"
"committed  on  him  by  the  concealment  or  suppression  of  an  earlier  deed  by  his"
"vendor.  The  effect  of  registration  is  to  give  the  transferee  whatever  title  the"
"vendor had prior to the execution of the earlier unregistered deeds.” (emphasis"
"added)."
