"to proof, it was not objected when read in evidence at the close of his case and as such it"
"must be considered as proved. Reliance was placed on the decision in  Sri Lanka Ports"
"Authority and Another v. Jugolinija-Boal East [(1981) 1 Sri.L.R. 18]."
"The Respondent countered that for the Appellant to come within Section 7(1) read with"
"Section  7(4)  of  the  Registration  of  Documents  Ordinance  No.23  of  1927  as  amended"
"(Ordinance), he had to prove that P2 was executed in terms of Section 2 of the Prevention"
"of Frauds Ordinance read with Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. Accordingly, it was"
"submitted that the Appellant was obliged to call at least one of the attesting witnesses"
"[Bandiya  v.  Ungu  (15  N.L.R.  263)].  Although  the  Notary  Public  who  executed  P2  was"
"called to testify by the Appellant, none of the attesting witnesses were called."
"The Respondent conceded that the Notary Public is as much an attesting witness as the"
"two  subscribing  witnesses  [Thiyagarasa  v.  Arunodayam  (1987)  2  Sri.L.R.  184].  But  in"
"order to do so, the Notary Public should have known the executant [Marian v. Jesuthasan"
"(59 N.L.R. 348); The Solicitor General v. Ahamadulebbe Ava Umma (71 N.L.R. 512 at 515"
"to 516)].  The Notary Public who executed P2 had stated in the attestation that she did"
"not know the executant."
"No doubt that P2 was required by Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance to be"
"attested. Hence Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance is engaged."
"During the pendency of this appeal, the Supreme Court delivered a divided judgment on"
"the  application  of  Section  68  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  and  the  decision  in  Sri  Lanka"
"Ports Authority (supra) to deeds in Kugabalan v. Ranaweera and Another [S.C. Appeal"
"No.  36/2014,  S.C.M.  12.02.2021].  This  was  followed  by  a  few  other  judgments  which"
"either followed the majority or minority view in Kugabalan (supra). The resulting position"
"was not clear."
