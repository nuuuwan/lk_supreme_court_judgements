"been registered as M 745/36. Learned Additional District Judge of Mt. Lavinia found that"
"it was registered in Volume 1251 and Folio 92."
"In Diyes Singho v. Herath (64 N.L.R. 492 at 494), it was also observed that the question"
"of whether an instrument has been duly registered, as required by the Ordinance, is a"
"mixed question of law and fact. The Respondent did not seek to assail this finding on the"
"mixed question of fact and law. Neither did the Court of Appeal."
"The Respondent has in the written submissions submitted priority by registration applies"
"only to paper title and not any rights derived otherwise such as prescriptive title. One of"
"the important limitations on the consequences of registration was explicitly adverted to"
"in Appuhamy v. Goonetilleke (18 N.L.R. 469) where it was held that prescription is a mode"
"of acquisition independent of any documentary title which the possessor may at the same"
"time  has,  and  although  documentary  title  may  be  defeated  by  the  operation  of  the"
"Registration Ordinance, the other remains unaffected."
"Hence where a party derives title from both a deed as well as prescription, although his"
"deed may have been registered later, his prescriptive title remains unaffected if he can"
"establish prescriptive title against the other party who claims priority by registration."
"However, the Respondent did not claim any prescriptive title against the Appellant in the"
"answer. Neither was any issue raised on any alleged prescriptive title of the Respondent."
"Special Leave to Appeal was not granted on any question dealing with  the prescriptive"
"rights of the Respondent. In these circumstances, I am not inclined to consider any issue"
"of the Respondentâ€™s prescriptive rights."
"Valuable Consideration"
"One of the grounds on which the Court of Appeal held against the Appellant is the failure"
"to prove that there was valuable consideration passing in respect of P2."
