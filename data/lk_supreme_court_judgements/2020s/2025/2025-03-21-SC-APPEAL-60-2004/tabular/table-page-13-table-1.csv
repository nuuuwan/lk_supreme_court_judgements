"In Fernando v. Fonseka  (1 C.L.R. 82) it was held that the term 'valuable consideration' is"
"a well-known term with a well-defined meaning it is money, marriage or the like, which"
"the law esteems as an equivalent given for the grant."
"The  Appellant  submitted  that  the  Respondent  had  not  raised  the  absence  of  valuable"
"consideration for P2 either in his answer or by way of an issue."
"In Diyes Singho v. Herath (64 N.L.R. 492) it was held that although no issue was raised by"
"either  party  in  respect  of  the  passing  of  valuable  consideration  for  the  subsequent"
"instrument,  the  absence  of  such  an  issue  could  not  have  the  effect  of  absolving  the"
"plaintiff from proving that valuable consideration was given."
"In the attestation clause in P2, Neelamani Malawisuriya, Notary Public who attested P2"
"clearly states that no consideration passed before here.  She confirmed this during her"
"testimony."
"In Diyes Singho (supra) it was held that proof of the existence of a statement in the deed"
"by the Notary that consideration was paid is not sufficient to establish the truth of the"
"payment of such consideration. Similarly, in Munasinghe v. Vidanage and Another (69"
"N.L.R.  97)  the  Privy  Council  held  that  the  statements  of  the  Notary  in  the  attestation"
"clause of a deed of sale are admissible evidence, and may well be important evidence,"
"regarding consideration, but are not conclusive."
"However, the position appears to be different when a vendor makes a statement in the"
"relevant deed on the  passing of valuable consideration. In Perera  v. Premawathie (74"
"N.L.R. 302) it was held that, the statement of the vendor contained in the deed that she"
"had  received  the  full  consideration  for  the  transfer  was  sufficient  to  prove  that  the"
"interest that passed on the deed was for valuable consideration. The court was mindful"
"that the impugned deed in that case is more than seventy years old and that the parties"
"and the witnesses to the deed are all dead. The Court sought to distinguish the decision"
