"This principle has been subsequently approved in Hariette v. Pathmasiri [(1996) 1 Sri.L.R."

"owned 
in  common,  and  for  damages  sustained  by  him  by  reason  of  the  wrongful"
"enjoyment of his share by the other co-owners."
"Accordingly, it is clear that the Appellant is entitled to maintain this action against the"
"Respondent to obtain a declaration that he is entitled to an undivided 1/8th  share of the"
"corpus."
