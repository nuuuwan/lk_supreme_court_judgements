"District Court. The Court of Appeal took the view that the Appellant is not entitled to an"
"order of ejectment against the Respondent."
"The Respondent by P3 obtained title to the full corpus. By P2, the Appellant obtained an"
"undivided 1/8th share of the corpus."
"In  Jayawardena  v.  Menike  [S.C.  Appeal  32/2009,  S.C.M.  04.03.2010]  it  was  held  that"
"priority  by  registration  applies  to  co-owned  property  as  well.  There  the  appellant  was"
"entitled to obtain 1/2 share by priority as that was all what he received by the deed which"
"had priority."
"Accordingly,  in  view  of  the  priority  of  registration,  the  title  of  the  Appellant  to  1/8th"
"undivided  share  of  the  corpus  takes  priority  over  the  title  of  the  Respondent  to  the"
"corpus. But that only affects 1/8th undivided share of the corpus. The other 7/8th share of"
"the  corpus  received  through  P3  remains  with  the  Respondent.  Section  7(1)  of  the"
"Ordinance does not apply to the said undivided 7/8th share."
"In Gunasekera v. Silva (58 N.L.R. 83) it was held that an order of ejectment will not be"
"made against a co-owner on the application of another co-owner. This was confirmed in"
"Waris Perera v. Pubilinahamy (66 N.L.R. 88 at 90), where H.N.G. Fernando, J. (as he was"
"then)  held  that  it  is  trite  law  that  until  co-ownership  is  dissolved  by  partition  or  by"
"prescription,  it  is  not  open  to  one  co-owner  to  exclude  another  from  any  particular"
"portion of the land."
"Hence, the learned Additional District Judge of Mt. Lavinia erred in law in granting the"
"Appellant an order of ejectment ejecting the Respondent from the corpus. The Court of"
"Appeal was correct in law in setting that part of the judgment aside."
"I answer Question of Law No. 3 in the negative."
