"examined the Appellant [Appeal Brief page 131] premised on the fact that he had bought"
"the corpus. Nevertheless, the Counsel for the Respondent failed to challenge this part of"
"the evidence of the Appellant during cross-examination."
"The established common law rule is that where a party intends to lead evidence that will"
"contradict or challenge the evidence of an opponent’s witness, it must put that evidence"
"to the witness in cross-examination. It is essentially a rule of fairness. A witness must not"
"be discredited without having had a chance to comment on or counter the discrediting"
"information. 
It  also  gives  the  other  party  notice  that 
its  witness’  evidence  will  be"
"contested and further corroboration may be required."
"In Browne v. Dunn [(1893) 6 R 67] it was held that if in the course of a case, it is intended"
"to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth upon a particular point, his attention"
"must  be  directed  to  the  fact  by  cross-examination  showing  that  the 
imputation 
is"
"intended  to  be  made,  so  that  he  may  have  an  opportunity  of  making  any  explanation"
"which  is  open  to  him,  unless  it  is  otherwise  perfectly  clear  that  he  has  had  full  notice"
"beforehand that there is an intention to impeach the credibility of his story."
"The legal effect of the failure to do so was considered in Edrick De Silva v. Chandradasa"
"De Silva (70 N.L.R. 170 at 174) where H.N.G. Fernando, C.J.,  observed that where the"
"plaintiff has in a civil case led evidence sufficient in law to prove a factum probandum, the"
"failure  of  the  defendant  to  adduce  evidence  which  contradicts  it  adds  a  new  factor  in"
"favour of the plaintiff. There is then an additional ""matter before the Court"", which the"
"definition in Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance requires the Court to take into account,"
"namely 
that 
the  evidence 
led  by 
the  plaintiff 
is  uncontradicted
