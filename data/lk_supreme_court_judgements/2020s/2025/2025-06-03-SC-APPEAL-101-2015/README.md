Argued on: 28.04.2025

Decided on: 03.06.2025

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs instituted this action in the District Court seeking a

declaration of title to the land described in the second schedule to the plaint,

which forms part of the land described in the first schedule, and the

ejectment of the defendants therefrom. The land described in the second

schedule to the plaint is depicted in Plan marked P1. The defendants sought

dismissal of the action on the ground that the land in suit had not been

properly identified. Upon conclusion of the trial, the District Court, by its

judgment dated 18.01.2010, upheld the position taken by the defendants

and dismissed the plaintiffs’ action. On appeal, the High Court of Civil

Appeal, by judgment dated 23.09.2014, affirmed the judgment of the

District Court. The plaintiffs are now before this court.

A previous Bench of this court had granted leave to appeal on the following

question of law:

Did the High Court and the District Court err in law in holding that the

withdrawal of the previous Partition Action No. 23321/P of the District

Court of Kegalle prior to the entering of the final decree amounts to res

judicata between the parties?

I must state at the outset that neither the District Court nor the High Court

had taken up such a position in their respective judgments, and therefore,

I am unable to answer that question. The plaintiffs’ action was dismissed

by both courts on the ground that the corpus had not been properly

identified, noting, inter alia, that the identification of the corpus in the

present action had become a real issue in light of the manner in which the

land was identified in the earlier partition action.

SC/APPEAL/101/2015 3

Let me explain the connection between this action and the earlier partition

action, and the manner in which the outcome of the former action bears

upon the plaintiffs’ action in the present matter.

There is no dispute that the plaintiffs in the present action are connected

to the plaintiffs in the earlier partition action, and that the previous

partition action was also filed in respect of the same land. The Preliminary

Plan prepared for the partition action was marked 1V2, and this plan was

superimposed on Plan P1, which was prepared for the instant action. The

superimposed plan was marked 1V4. The superimposition demonstrates

that Lot 3 in Plan P1 does not fall within the land described in the first

schedule to the plaint in the instant action, which corresponds to the land

described in the schedule to the partition action. It is therefore evident that

the plaintiffs have failed to properly identify the corpus in the present

action, which is a sine qua non for the plaintiffs to succeed in this action.

After the interlocutory decree was entered, the plaintiffs withdrew the

partition action. However, in terms of section 48, subject to the conditions

set out therein, both the interlocutory decree entered under section 26 and

the final decree of partition entered under section 36 are final and

conclusive. In other words, the interlocutory decree does not become invalid

merely because the action did not proceed to finality.

For the aforesaid reasons, the appeal is dismissed but without costs.
