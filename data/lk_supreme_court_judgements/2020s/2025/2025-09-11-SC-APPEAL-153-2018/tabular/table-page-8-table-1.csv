"4455 had priority over the Deed No. 20499 and therefore Deed No. 20499 is"
"not a valid deed."
"[12]  The  District  Court  answered  the  issues  on  title  in  favour  of  the  Plaintiff-"
"Respondent. It also noted that no issues had been raised by either party on the"
"claim of a  Constructive  Trust.  The  Court  dismissed the  action  on the  ground"
"that the Plaintiff-Respondent had failed to establish that the property was held"
"by the Defendant-Appellant on a Constructive Trust, and held that ejectment"
"could not be granted as the Plaint was framed on that basis."
"[13]  The  Court  held  that  the  title  to  the  property  in  dispute  has  passed  to  the"
"Plaintiff-Respondent,  and  such  has  been  established.  However,  since  no"
"declaration of title was prayed for as a substantial relief, no order for ejectment"
"can  be granted. The  Court  relied  on the Judgment in  Surangi vs. Rodrigo1,"
"where it was held that “no court is entitled to or has jurisdiction to grant reliefs"
"to a party which are not prayed for in the prayer to the Plaint”"
"Findings of the Civil Appellate High Court"
"[14]  In the Civil Appellate High Court, the Defendant-Appellant took up the position"
"that  the Plaintiff-Respondent did  not establish  his  title  on  the  said  Deed  No."
"4455 dated 28/06/1969, and therefore, the District Court erred in answering"
"issues No. 1, 8, 9, 13 and 14, on the title to the property in favour of the Plaintiff-"
"Respondent. The Civil Appellate Court, in its findings, held;"
"“However,  the  Defendant  filed  no  appeal  challenging  such  findings  of  the"
"learned trial judge unfavourable to her, and no steps taken to file cross appeal"
