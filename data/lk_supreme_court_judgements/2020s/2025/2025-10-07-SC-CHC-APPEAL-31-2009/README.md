Pre Argument Written Submissions By the Plaintiff-Respondent on 24.03.2023.​ ARGUED ON: ​24.10.2023​ DECIDED ON: 07.10.2025 K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J. This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of the Western

Province holden in Colombo (Exercising its Civil Jurisdiction), dated

25.11.2009.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the “Respondent”)

instituted the initial action before the High Court of the Western

Province holden in Colombo (Exercising its Civil Jurisdiction)

(Commercial High Court), against the Defendant-Appellant-

(hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”).

The Respondent instituted this action on 29 July, 2005 against the

Appellant upon three (3) causes of action together with an alternative

​​2

cause of action on the basis that a sum of Rs.17,982,358.38 is due in

respect of goods sold and delivered and for a further cause of action

for loss and damage being 30% of Rs.17,982,358.38 per annum from

1st October, 2004.

The Respondent on or about 3rd August, 2004 at the request of the

Appellant sold and delivered to the Defendant-Appellant the empty

glass bottles at the specifications specified in and at the prices stated

in the invoice dated 3rd August, 2004. A true copy of the said invoice

was annexed to the Plaint marked "P1" (page 48/64 of the Brief). The

said document was marked in evidence as "P2" - (page 87/110 of the

Brief).

The Appellant had failed and/or neglected to pay the Respondent the

said sum of Rs.6,341,511.60 or any part thereof though thereto

obliged and though thereto demanded. The Respondent on or about

27th August, 2004 at the request of the Appellant sold and delivered

to the Appellant empty glass bottles at the specifications specified in

and at the price stated in the invoice dated 27th August, 2004. A true

copy of the said invoice was annexed to the Plaint marked "P2" (page

49/65 of the Brief). The said document was marked in evidence as

"P4" - (page 98/121 of the Brief). The Appellant failed and/or neglected

to pay the Respondent the said sum of Rs.1,933,656.20 or any part

thereof though obliged and demanded.

The Respondent on or about 1st September, 2004 at the request of the

Appellant sold and delivered to the Appellant the empty glass bottles

at the specifications given in and at the price stated in the invoice

dated 15th September, 2004. A true copy of the said invoice was

​​3

marked "P3" (page 50/66 of the Brief). The said document was marked

in evidence as "P6" - (page 103/126 of the Brief).

The Appellant had failed and/or neglected to pay the Respondent the

said sum of Rs.9,707,190.58 or any part thereof though obliged and

demanded. The Respondent on or about 1st September, 2004 at the

request of the Appellant sold and delivered to the Appellant empty

glass bottles at the specifications given in and at the price stated in

the invoice dated 1st September, 2004. A true copy of the said invoice

was annexed to the Plaint marked "P3" (page 50/66 of the Brief). The

said document was marked in evidence as "P6" - (page 103/126 of the

Brief). The Appellant has failed and/or neglected to pay the

Respondent the said sum of Rs.9,707,190.58 or any part thereof

though obliged and demanded.

By letter dated 6th September, 2004 the Appellant acknowledged that

a sum of Rs.17,982,358.38 is due and owing from the Appellant to the

Respondent and promised and undertook to pay the same to the

Respondent. A true copy of the said letter was marked "P4" (page

51/67 of the Brief). The said document was marked in evidence as

"P8" - (page 118/141 of the Brief). The Appellant failed and neglected

to pay the said sums of money in the months of August and

September causing the Respondent loss and damages which the

Respondent estimates at 30% of Rs. 17,982,358.38 per annum from

15 October, 2004 till the said sum of Rs.17,982,358.38 is paid to the

Respondent.

On 25th October, 2005, the Defendant-Appellant filed Answer (page

52/68 of the Brief) and denied liability and stated, inter alia, that -

​​4

(a) that the appellant is not liable to make the payment.

(b) that the Appellant is engaged in the business of manufacturing and

distribution of alcohol;

(c )that the Respondent represented that the Plaintiff-Respondent was

the agent of Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD and that the principal

of the Respondent was in a position to supply quality empty glass

bottles to the Appellant;

(d) that although the Respondent supplied glass bottles to the

Appellant, the Respondent delayed in supplying the glass bottles;

(e) that the Respondent had not paid its dues to its principal and the

said principal made a claim on the Defendant-Appellant;

(f) that there was a meeting on 4th September, 2004 between the

Respondent, Appellant and the principal of the Respondent, namely Jg

Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD and an arrangement was reached

whereby in the event the Respondent failed to pay the principal of the

Respondent, the Appellant to pay directly to the said Jg Containers

(Malaysia) SDN BHD.

(g) that although the Respondent undertook to pay to Jg Containers

(Malaysia) SDN BHD, failed to pay to Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN

BHD and consequently, a demand was made on the Appellant by Jg

Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD and the Appellant made the payment

of Rs.17,982,358.38 to Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD.

(h) that in the circumstances, thus and otherwise the Appellant is not

liable to make any payment to the Respondent;

(i) that as a result of the delay in supplying the goods by the

Respondent as undertaken by it loss and damage in a sum of

Rs.400,000,000/- was caused to the Appellant;

(j) that as the Respondent failed to supply the goods as per the

invoices marked with the Plaint and as a result of the delay in

​​5

supplying the goods, the Appellant could not continue with its

business and had suffered loss and damage in a sum of

Rs.400,000,000/-;

(k) that as a result of the Plaintiff-Respondent not making payments of

its dues due to Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD, Jg Containers

(Malaysia) SDN BHD failed to supply and/or refused to supply empty

bottles to the Defendant-Appellant and as a result of that the

Defendant-Appellant could not continue with its business properly

and as such, the Defendant-Appellant suffered loss in a sum of

Rs.100,000,000/- as a consequence thereof.

The Respondent filed replication denying the claims in reconvention in

the answer of the appellant. Thereafter, when the matter was taken up

for trial on 21st March, 2006 (page 308 of the Brief), five (5)

admissions were recorded and the fifth admission was subject to the

reservations made therein. The translation of the said admissions are

as follows:

01. The Defendant is a duly incorporated company and its registered

office and/or principle place of business is situated within the local

limits of the Jurisdiction of this Court.

02. Jurisdiction of the Court is admitted.

03. The Defendant is engaged in the business of manufacture, sale and

supply of alcohol both locally and abroad.

04. The Plaintiff issued invoices dated 3rd of August, 27th of August

and 15th September, 2004 and the Defendant was in receipt of the

same.

05. Mr.Romesh De Silva, President Counsel moves to record as an

Admission that the letter referred to in paragraph 21 of the Answer has

been written by the Defendant. Mr. Gomin Dayasiri states that, if the

said fact is recorded in that manner and on that basis alone that is, in

​​6

considering all the other matters also averred in paragraph 21 of the

Answer, he is agreeable to the same.

Accordingly, in the aforesaid premises, taking into consideration the

entirety of the matters stated in paragraph 21, it is admitted that the

said letter was written by the Defendant.

The Appellants contended that the evidence of witnesses had been

recorded and concluded before Honourable K.T. Chitrasiri, then Judge

of the High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo

(Exercising its Civil Jurisdiction). Upon his elevation to the Court of

Appeal, the judgment could not be delivered by him. Consequently,

the parties agreed that the succeeding Learned High Court Judge, who

had not heard the oral testimonies, would deliver judgment. The

Appellants maintained that as a result, the succeeding Judge

erroneously recorded that it was their position from the inception that

there existed a tripartite agreement between the Respondent, the

Appellant, and Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD.

The Appellant averred that it was not in dispute that the Respondent

had failed to make payments to Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD for

bottles supplied prior to 1st September 2004. The uncontradicted oral

testimony of the General Manager of Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN

BHD established that as of that date substantial sums remained

outstanding from the Respondent. The admitted document marked

“V35”, dated 1st September 2004, confirmed that an amount of USD

235,869.78 was due in respect of shipments effected between March

and August 2004. The Respondent’s failure to honour the Sales

Agreement with Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD disrupted the

smooth functioning of the Appellant.

The Appellants further contended that the Learned Trial Judge erred

in law in failing to appreciate that although the Appellant was not a

​​7

party named in, nor a signatory to, the agreement, it was pursuant to

the arrangement between the Respondent and the Appellant that the

Sales Agreement marked “V8” came into existence.

It was the Appellants contention that it was common ground that the

Appellant had settled the monies claimed by Jg Containers (Malaysia)

SDN BHD under the said letter, but the Respondent failed to remit the

same to Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD.

The Appellants emphasised the significance of the meeting held on 4th

September 2004. The representative of Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN

BHD, as well as other witnesses of the Appellant, confirmed that such

a meeting took place. Two of the three parties present, testified that an

arrangement was reached whereby, in the event the Respondent failed

to pay the outstanding USD 235,869.78, the Appellant would be

entitled to make such payment. The Appellants submitted that

although this understanding was not subsequently confirmed in

writing, the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to recognise

that this was the natural and ordinary course of events arising out of

the meeting of 4th September 2004.

The Appellants further submitted that the Learned Trial Judge, having

observed that the Respondent’s witness was not truthful, erred in law

in nonetheless entering judgment in favour of the Respondent. They

argued that if payment is now ordered to be made to the Respondent,

the Appellant would effectively be required to make double payment in

respect of the same liability. It was undisputed that the Appellant had

already settled the sums due by the Respondent to Jg Containers

(Malaysia) SDN BHD. A further payment to the Respondent would

unjustly enrich the Respondent in the sum of Rs. 17,982,358.38, to

the detriment of the Appellant.

​​8

The Appellants contended that the Learned Trial Judge, having noted

that the Chairman/Managing Director of the Respondent admitted

that under-invoicing was illegal, failed to appreciate that the

Respondent’s conduct was fraudulent and that it sought to enforce an

illegal transaction. It was their position that the Respondent had

derived its rights under the contract through fraud and illegality,

rendering the entire contract a nullity and unenforceable. The Learned

Trial Judge, while finding that the Respondent’s witness was evasive,

untruthful, and concealing facts, nevertheless grossly misdirected

himself in concluding that no agreement had been reached at the

meeting of 4th September 2004.

The Appellants further submitted that their claim in reconvention had

been substantiated by documentary evidence. All documents tendered

by the Appellant were admitted, and no further proof was necessary.

The Respondent failed to specify which documents, if any, remained

unproven. In these circumstances, the Respondent could not properly

maintain that the documents marked subject to proof had not been

proved. The Appellant established by documentary evidence that,

owing to the Respondent’s conduct, its foreign supplier, Jg Containers

(Malaysia) SDN BHD, ceased supply, resulting in loss to the Appellant.

Accordingly, the Appellants contended that their claim had been duly

established, and they are entitled to the reliefs prayed for in their

Answer.

The Respondent in their written submissions contended that the High

Court entered the judgment in favour of the Respondent. The

Respondent stated that the Appellants case is mala fide in the

Appellants takes up two contrary positions:

(i) that the Appellant was dealing with the Respondent’s principal in

Malaysia

​​9

(ii) that at a meeting held on 4th September 2004, the Respondent,

Appellant and the Malaysians (Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD)

agreed that in the event of the Respondent not paying the Malaysians

(Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD) a certain sum of money the

Appellant would forward the sum of Rs. 17,000,000/- claimed in this

case to the Malaysians.

At the outset, the Respondent contended that the Appellant’s claim is

fraudulent. If, as alleged, the contract was between the Appellant and

the Respondent’s principal in Malaysia, then the Appellant was under

no obligation to pay any sum of money to the Respondent but only to

the said principal. In such circumstances, there would have been no

necessity for a meeting, nor for the Respondent’s consent, for the

Appellant to remit payment to the supplier in Malaysia.

The Respondent further submits that the Appellant, while claiming to

have made payments to the principal in Malaysia, now asserts a claim

in reconvention against the Respondent for alleged defective bottles. It

is the Respondent’s position that if the agreement was with the

Malaysian principal, any claim in reconvention must necessarily lie

against that principal and not against the Respondent. In any event, if

the Appellant’s version is to be believed, any such alleged claims

should have been deducted from the sum of Rs. 17,982,358.38/- prior

to its payment to the Malaysian supplier, rather than pursued against

the Respondent.

The Respondent maintains that their case is straightforward: the

Respondent sold and delivered bottles to the Appellant, for which a

sum of Rs. 17,982,358.38 remains due and owing. By letter dated 6th

September 2004, marked P8, the Appellant expressly acknowledged

this liability and promised to pay the said sum. The Appellant’s failure

to honour that promise gives rise to the Respondent’s entitlement to

​​10

recover the same. The Respondent has produced all relevant invoices

and delivery notes, which stand unchallenged, as their witnesses were

not cross-examined on any of the documents marked on behalf of the

Respondent.

The Respondent further submits that the Appellant’s own claim in

reconvention for defective and delayed deliveries reinforces that the

contract for sale of goods was between the Respondent and the

Appellant, and not between the Appellant and the Malaysian principal.

The Respondent specifically denied that the Respondent ever agreed to

the Appellant remitting monies directly to the Malaysian supplier. At

no stage did the Appellant document such an agreement. Being a large

multinational company, if such an arrangement had in fact been

reached, the Appellant would undoubtedly have reduced it into

writing.

It is the Respondent's position that the letter marked P8, issued on

6th September 2004, merely two days after the purported meeting of

4th September, makes no reference whatsoever to any such

arrangement. On the contrary, it expressly acknowledges liability to

the Respondent. Notably, the letter was signed by Mr. Rajanathan,

Supplies Manager of the Appellant, who was present at the alleged

meeting. Had such an agreement been reached on 4th September, he

would not have signed a letter admitting liability to the Respondent

only two days later.

Further, the Respondent averred that, despite the extensive

correspondence exchanged between the parties, the Appellant made

no mention of any agreement arising out of a meeting on 4th

September 2004. The first occasion on which the Appellant sought to

advance this version was only after receipt of the Respondent’s letter

​​11

of demand. Even when payment was allegedly made to Jg Containers

(Malaysia) SDN BHD, the Appellant did not notify the Respondent,

thereby casting doubt on whether such payment was in fact made.

The Respondent contends that the Respondent was cross-examined on

the basis that there had been under-invoicing between the

Respondent and the Malaysian supplier of bottles. It is submitted that

this issue is wholly irrelevant to the present case. The matter before

Court concerns the bottles sold and delivered by the Respondent to

the Appellant. If any under-invoicing existed between the Respondent

and the Malaysian supplier, such would:​

a. be a matter for the Customs Authorities and/or any other

governmental regulatory authority; and​

b. concern only the relationship between the Malaysian supplier and

the Respondent.

The Respondent contends it is immaterial to the transaction between

the Respondent and the Appellant. The invoices exchanged between

the Respondent and the Appellant reflected the actual value of the

goods supplied and the genuine transactions between the parties.

Significantly, there has been no allegation of illegality of any kind in

respect of the transaction between the Respondent and the Appellant.

With respect to the Appellant’s claim in reconvention, the Respondent

submits that no evidence was led to establish either defective bottles

or delayed deliveries. The only documents relied upon in support of

such a claim were documents V58 to V60. Counsel for the Appellant

undertook to call one Mr. Nagahawatte, the person who prepared

those documents, to prove them. However, Mr. Nagahawatte was not

called, nor was any other witness led to properly mark those

documents or give evidence in support of the alleged claim.

​​12

In the circumstances, the Respondent maintains that the Appellant’s

claim in reconvention is wholly unsubstantiated, while the

Respondent’s claim is supported by documentary evidence, including

the express acknowledgment of liability in P8, entitling the

Respondent to judgment as prayed for.

The Learned High Court Judge, by judgment dated 2009.10.01 held in

favour of the Respondent and had identified three causes of action for

the recovery of the sum of Rs. 17,982,358.38, being the value of

bottles sold and delivered by the Respondent to the Appellant. In

arriving at this conclusion, the Learned Judge held that the document

marked P8 did not constitute a formal written agreement but rather

amounted to an acknowledgment by the Appellant that the said sum

was due and payable to the Respondent.

The Learned Judge further held that the document marked V8

evidenced an agreement between the Respondent and the Malaysian

supplier, and not a tripartite arrangement as the Appellant sought to

suggest. No document was produced evidencing the existence of such

a tripartite agreement, notwithstanding the Appellant’s attempt to

establish one by implication. The Learned Judge observed that the

contracts for the sale of goods evidenced by invoices P1, P2 and P3

were independent transactions between the Respondent and the

Appellant, unaffected by the separate agreement between the

Respondent and the Malaysian supplier.

The Learned Judge has also emphasised the significant fact that the

Malaysian supplier was not made a party to these proceedings. The

letter marked V36 contains no denial of the liability acknowledged in

P8, while the document marked V52 amounts to no more than a

request by the Malaysian supplier that payment be made to the

Appellant. That request, however, does not create any legal obligation

​​13

binding upon the Respondent, nor does it reflect any agreement by the

Respondent to alter the existing contractual relationship with the

Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge observed that the absence of a written

tripartite agreement is of material significance. The Court also

observed that the Appellant, in its own written submissions before the

High Court, had conceded that there existed an agreement distinct

from V8, thereby undermining its own contention that liability to the

Respondent was displaced by a tripartite arrangement.

I will now turn to the applicable principles of law.

According to Sri Lankan law, several elements must be satisfied in

order to create a valid and enforceable agreement between two or more

parties. As enumerated by C. G. Weeramantry in The Law of

Contracts, Volume I at page 84, the prerequisites of a contract are:​

(a) an agreement between the parties;​

(b) the actual or presumed intention of the parties to create a legal

obligation;​

(c) due observance of prescribed forms or modes of agreement;​

(d) legality and possibility of the object of the agreement; and​

(e) capacity of the parties to contract.

As noted in Chitty on Contracts Volume 1 General Principles (31st

ed., Sweet & Maxwell, para. 2-003), the essentials of a valid contract

include agreement, consideration (or causa), intention to create legal

relations, capacity, and, where applicable, proper form. Nonetheless,

even when these requisites are satisfied, the contract may nonetheless

be void or voidable if vitiated by misrepresentation, mistake, duress,

undue influence, or illegality. The Roman-Dutch legal tradition which

underpins Sri Lankan contract law similarly insists that consent must

​​14

be free from error, force or fraud (Voet Commentarius ad Pandectas

2.14.7), and our courts have consistently held that absence of

genuine consent undermines enforceability.

Therefore, based on the established principles governing the law of

Contract, it is well established that the mere presence of offer and

acceptance does not, of itself, suffice to constitute a valid and

enforceable contract. The law further requires additional elements

such as consideration or causa, an intention to create legal relations,

compliance with any prescribed form, and the legal capacity of the

parties. Yet, even the concurrence of all these essentials does not

invariably guarantee the validity of the agreement. Where the

transaction is tainted by vitiating factors such as duress, the

purported contract cannot, in law, be regarded as binding.

In Wimala Perera v. Kalyani Siriyalatha [2011] 1 SLR 182,

Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane affirmed that:

“It is an elementary rule that every contract requires an offer

and acceptance. Therefore an offer or promise which is not

accepted, is not actionable [vide Justice Weerasooriya in

Muthukuda v. Sumanawathie 4 NLR 321 at 208, 209]. It has

been stated that it is an elementary proposition of law that a

contract is concluded when in the mind of each contracting

party there is a consensus ad idem, Noorbhai v. Karuppan

Chetty (1925) 27 NLR 325 (per Lord Wrenbury). Cumulatively

therefore an intention to create a legal relationship and a

consensus ad idem or meeting of the minds needs to be in

existence in order to establish a contract between the parties.”

Soertsz J. in Edward Silva v. De Silva [1945] 46 NLR 510 also

emphasised that, for a promise to be enforceable,

​​15

“the agreement must be a deliberate, serious act, not one that

is irrational or motiveless.”

These principles resonate with established common law doctrines. In

Balfour v. Balfour [1919] 2 KB 571, Atkin LJ underscored that not

all agreements are legally binding unless there is an intention to

create legal relations, while in Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.

[1893] 1 QB 256, the English Court of Appeal affirmed that where

there is a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration, coupled with an

intention to be bound, the promise becomes enforceable. These

comparative authorities highlight that the bedrock of contractual

liability lies in consensus ad idem, intention, and enforceability in law.

In the case of People’s Bank v Ceylinco Insurance Company

Limited [SC CHC Appeal 06/2003 decided on 11.02.2016] it was

held that,

“I am of the view that any Court is entitled to look into the

surrounding circumstances in order to identify the scope and

object of the guarantee bonds just as much as it would be

entitled to look at the factual matrix as an aid to the

interpretation of any other commercial agreement. The court

should always seek to construe the document in such a way as

to reflect what may fairly be inferred to have been the objective,

intention and understanding of the parties.”

The central issue in this matter is whether the Appellant is liable to

pay the Respondent the sum of Rs. 17,982,358.38 for bottles sold and

delivered. The Respondent relies upon, inter alia, the admitted letter

dated 6th September 2004 (marked P8), wherein the Appellant

expressly acknowledged the said liability and undertook to make

payment.

​​16

The Appellant stance is that the true arrangement was tripartite,

involving the Malaysian supplier, Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD,

with the Respondent acting merely as an intermediary. The alleged

meeting of 4th September 2004 is unsupported by any

contemporaneous documentation, while P8, signed two days later by

the Appellant’s own officer who attended that meeting, is a clear

written acknowledgment of liability to the Respondent. Thus, even if

discussions took place with a view to involving the Malaysian supplier,

they did not crystallise into a legally binding arrangement; instead, the

operative agreement remained the one evidenced in P8. The existence

of a valid contract requires a meeting of the minds supported by an

intention to be legally bound. What the Appellant has sought to

portray is, at best, an informally agreed transaction without the

attributes of a legally enforceable agreement

The Learned High Court Judge has observed that the document

marked P8 did not constitute a formal written agreement but

nevertheless amounted to an express acknowledgment by the

Appellant of its liability to the Respondent. I find no reason to depart

from this finding. The Learned High Court Judge further held that the

Sales Agreement marked V8 evidenced an agreement solely between

the Respondent and its Principal, and not a tripartite arrangement as

suggested by the Appellant. I am in agreement with this conclusion.

No contemporaneous document has been produced by the Appellant

to substantiate the existence of a tripartite arrangement, and it is

significant that the Malaysian supplier, who would have been a

necessary party to such an arrangement, was not included in these

proceedings. As the High Court Judge rightly observed, had such a

tripartite agreement existed, it would inevitably have been reflected in

either V36 or V52; however, neither document contains any reference

to such an arrangement. P8 here is not the product of casual

​​17

discussion or informal understanding but a deliberate and

unequivocal commitment.

The Appellant further alleged that the Respondent engaged in

under-invoicing with its Malaysian supplier. With regard to the

allegation of under-invoicing, the High Court Judge rightly held that

such matters are wholly irrelevant to the civil obligations between the

present parties. The contract in question is confined to the

relationship between the Appellant and the Respondent, and any

allegation of under-invoicing between the Respondent and its

Malaysian supplier does not impinge upon the enforceability of that

contract. I am inclined to affirm this view, which is consistent with the

principle that collateral arrangements or irregularities with third

parties do not vitiate an otherwise binding agreement. Even where

such collateral conduct is suggested, it does not nullify a contract that

is otherwise valid and enforceable. The alleged under-invoicing does

not affect the enforceability of the agreement between the Respondent

and the Appellant as the contract in question is limited to the

agreement between these two parties, and any alleged under-invoicing

as between the Respondent and its supplier does not affect the

enforceability of the obligations herein.

Upon perusal of the Judgment of the Learned High Court Judge and

his reasoning, I see no reason to interfere with his findings because in

my view the judgment reflects a careful and thorough analysis of the

facts, documents, and evidence, including the testimonies of the

witnesses. I see no way in which the Appellant has been prejudiced by

the change of the judge as the Appellants contended that the evidence

of witnesses had been recorded and concluded before Honourable K.T.

Chitrasiri, then Judge of the High Court Colombo. Upon his elevation

to the Court of Appeal, the judgment could not be delivered by him.

​​18

With consent of the parties, the succeeding Learned High Court

Judge, who had not heard the oral testimony, delivered judgment. If

the Appellants had any objection to this arrangement, such objection

ought to have been raised at that stage of the proceedings. Their

failure to do so renders the present objection untenable. The alleged

misstatement regarding the Appellants’ position on the existence of a

tripartite agreement does not, in my view, amount to any prejudice

warranting appellate interference. It is also pertinent to note that the

documents relied on by the Appellant from V1 to V48 have been

tendered to this court by the Respondent as the Appellants had taken

no steps for over 3 years to furnish the following documents and

prosecute the appeal filed by them in the first place.

The claim that payment to the Respondent would amount to a “double

payment” is equally unsustainable. Once more, the Appellant has

failed to produce any evidence that its alleged payment to Jg

Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD discharged the sum acknowledged in

P8. Without proof of such discharge, this assertion remains at the

level of an informally agreed transaction, incapable of displacing the

legally binding obligation expressly admitted by the Appellant in

writing.

With respect to the claim in reconvention, the Appellant’s allegations

of defective or delayed delivery are similarly unsupported. The

documents marked V58 to V60 were not properly proved, nor was any

evidence of actual loss adduced. The accepted position in law is that

enforceability requires a deliberate and serious foundation. The

Appellant’s claim in reconvention, lacking both form and proof,

amounts only to an informal complaint rather than a legally

cognisable claim.

​​19

On the totality of the evidence and the applicable principles, this

Court is satisfied that the Respondent has established a valid and

enforceable contract for the sale and delivery of bottles. The elements

of offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal

relations are present and free from vitiating factors. The Appellant has

failed to substantiate the existence of any tripartite arrangement or

the discharge of its liability by payment to the Malaysian supplier, and

its claim in reconvention cannot succeed.

Having examined the facts of the case, and the material placed before

this court, I dismiss the appeal of the Appellant and uphold the

judgment of the High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo (Exercising its Civil Jurisdiction).

Appeal dismissed.
