"The  Appellant  stance 
is  that  the  true  arrangement  was  tripartite,"
"involving  the  Malaysian  supplier,  Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD,"
"with  the  Respondent  acting  merely  as  an  intermediary.  The  alleged"
"meeting 
of 
4th 
September 
2004 
is 
unsupported 
by 
any"
"contemporaneous  documentation,  while  P8,  signed  two  days  later  by"
"the  Appellantâ€™s  own  officer  who  attended  that  meeting,  is  a  clear"
"written  acknowledgment  of  liability  to  the  Respondent.  Thus,  even  if"
"discussions took place with a view to involving the Malaysian supplier,"
"they did not crystallise into a legally binding arrangement; instead, the"
"operative  agreement  remained  the  one evidenced in P8. The existence"
"of  a  valid  contract  requires  a  meeting  of  the  minds  supported  by  an"
"intention 
to  be 
legally  bound.  What  the  Appellant  has  sought  to"
"portray 
is,  at  best,  an 
informally  agreed  transaction  without  the"
"attributes of a legally enforceable agreement"
"The  Learned  High  Court  Judge  has  observed  that  the  document"
"marked  P8  did  not  constitute  a 
formal  written  agreement  but"
"nevertheless 
amounted 
to 
an 
express 
acknowledgment 
by 
the"
"Appellant  of  its  liability  to  the  Respondent. I find no reason to depart"
"from this finding. The Learned High Court Judge further held that the"
"Sales  Agreement  marked  V8  evidenced  an  agreement  solely  between"
"the  Respondent  and its Principal, and not a tripartite arrangement as"
"suggested  by  the  Appellant.  I  am  in  agreement  with  this  conclusion."
"No  contemporaneous  document  has  been  produced  by  the  Appellant"
"to  substantiate  the  existence  of  a  tripartite  arrangement,  and  it  is"
"significant 
that 
the  Malaysian  supplier,  who  would  have  been  a"
"necessary  party  to  such  an  arrangement,  was  not  included  in  these"
"proceedings.  As  the  High  Court  Judge  rightly  observed,  had  such  a"
"tripartite  agreement existed, it would inevitably have been reflected in"
"either  V36  or  V52;  however, neither document contains any reference"
"to  such  an  arrangement.  P8  here 
is  not 
the  product  of  casual"
