"Accordingly,  in  the  aforesaid  premises,  taking  into  consideration  the"
"entirety  of  the  matters  stated  in  paragraph  21,  it  is  admitted  that  the"

"The  Appellants  contended  that  the  evidence  of  witnesses  had  been"
"recorded and concluded before Honourable K.T. Chitrasiri, then Judge"
"of 
the  High  Court  of 
the  Western  Province  Holden 
in  Colombo"
"(Exercising  its  Civil  Jurisdiction).  Upon  his  elevation  to  the  Court  of"
