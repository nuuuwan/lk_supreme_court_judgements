"With  consent  of 
the  parties, 
the  succeeding  Learned  High  Court"
"Judge,  who  had  not  heard  the  oral  testimony,  delivered  judgment.  If"
"the  Appellants  had  any  objection  to this arrangement, such objection"
"ought  to  have  been  raised  at  that  stage  of  the  proceedings.  Their"
"failure  to  do  so  renders  the  present  objection  untenable.  The  alleged"
"misstatement  regarding  the  Appellants’  position  on  the  existence of a"
"tripartite  agreement  does  not,  in  my  view,  amount  to  any  prejudice"
"warranting  appellate  interference.  It  is  also  pertinent  to note that the"
"documents  relied  on  by  the  Appellant  from  V1  to  V48  have  been"
"tendered to this court by the Respondent as the Appellants had taken"
"no  steps  for  over  3  years  to  furnish  the  following  documents  and"
"prosecute the appeal filed by them in the first place."
"The claim that payment to the Respondent would amount to a “double"
"payment” 
is  equally  unsustainable.  Once  more,  the  Appellant  has"
"failed 
to  produce  any  evidence 
that 
its  alleged  payment 
to  Jg"
"Containers  (Malaysia) SDN BHD discharged the sum acknowledged in"
"P8.  Without  proof  of  such  discharge,  this  assertion  remains  at  the"
"level  of  an  informally  agreed  transaction,  incapable  of  displacing  the"
"legally  binding  obligation  expressly  admitted  by 
the  Appellant 
in"
"writing."
"With  respect  to  the  claim  in  reconvention,  the  Appellant’s  allegations"
"of  defective 
or  delayed  delivery  are  similarly  unsupported.  The"
"documents marked V58 to V60 were not properly proved, nor was any"
"evidence  of  actual  loss  adduced.  The  accepted  position  in  law  is  that"
"enforceability 
requires  a  deliberate  and  serious 
foundation.  The"
"Appellant’s  claim 
in 
reconvention, 
lacking  both 
form  and  proof,"
"amounts 
only 
to  an 
informal 
complaint 
rather 
than  a 
legally"
"cognisable claim."
