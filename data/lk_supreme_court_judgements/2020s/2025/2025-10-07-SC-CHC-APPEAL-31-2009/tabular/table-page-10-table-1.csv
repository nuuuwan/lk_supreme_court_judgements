"(ii)  that  at  a  meeting  held  on  4th  September  2004,  the  Respondent,"
"Appellant  and  the  Malaysians  (Jg  Containers  (Malaysia)  SDN  BHD)"
"agreed  that in the event of the Respondent not paying the Malaysians"
"(Jg  Containers 
(Malaysia)  SDN  BHD)  a  certain  sum  of  money  the"
"Appellant  would  forward  the  sum of Rs. 17,000,000/- claimed in this"
"case to the Malaysians."
"At  the  outset, the Respondent contended that the Appellant’s claim is"
"fraudulent.  If, as alleged, the contract was between the Appellant and"
"the  Respondent’s principal in Malaysia, then the Appellant was under"
"no  obligation  to pay any sum of money to the Respondent but only to"
"the  said  principal.  In  such  circumstances,  there  would  have  been  no"
"necessity  for  a  meeting,  nor  for  the  Respondent’s  consent,  for  the"
"Appellant to remit payment to the supplier in Malaysia."
"The  Respondent  further submits that the Appellant, while claiming to"
"have made payments to the principal in Malaysia, now asserts a claim"
"in reconvention against the Respondent for alleged defective bottles. It"
"is 
the  Respondent’s  position 
that 
if 
the  agreement  was  with  the"
"Malaysian  principal,  any  claim  in  reconvention  must  necessarily  lie"
"against that principal and not against the Respondent. In any event, if"
"the  Appellant’s  version 
is  to  be  believed,  any  such  alleged  claims"
"should have been deducted from the sum of Rs. 17,982,358.38/- prior"
"to its payment to the Malaysian supplier, rather than pursued against"
"the Respondent."
"The  Respondent  maintains 
that  their  case 
is  straightforward:  the"
"Respondent  sold  and  delivered  bottles  to  the  Appellant,  for  which  a"
"sum of Rs. 17,982,358.38 remains due and owing. By letter dated 6th"
"September  2004,  marked  P8,  the  Appellant  expressly  acknowledged"
"this liability and promised to pay the said sum. The Appellant’s failure"
"to  honour  that  promise  gives  rise  to  the  Respondent’s  entitlement  to"
