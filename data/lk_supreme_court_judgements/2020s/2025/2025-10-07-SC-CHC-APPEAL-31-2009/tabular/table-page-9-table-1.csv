"The  Appellants  contended  that the Learned Trial Judge, having noted"
"that  the  Chairman/Managing  Director  of  the  Respondent  admitted"
"that 
under-invoicing  was 
illegal, 
failed 
to 
appreciate 
that 
the"
"Respondent’s conduct was fraudulent and that it sought to enforce an"
"illegal  transaction. 
It  was  their  position  that  the  Respondent  had"
"derived 
its  rights  under  the  contract  through  fraud  and  illegality,"
"rendering the entire contract a nullity and unenforceable. The Learned"
"Trial  Judge,  while  finding  that  the  Respondent’s witness was evasive,"
"untruthful,  and  concealing 
facts,  nevertheless  grossly  misdirected"
"himself  in  concluding  that  no  agreement  had  been  reached  at  the"
"meeting of 4th September 2004."
"The Appellants further submitted that their claim in reconvention had"
"been substantiated by documentary evidence. All documents tendered"
"by  the  Appellant  were  admitted,  and  no  further  proof  was  necessary."
"The  Respondent  failed  to  specify  which  documents,  if  any,  remained"
"unproven. In these circumstances, the Respondent could not properly"
"maintain  that  the  documents  marked  subject  to  proof  had  not  been"
"proved.  The  Appellant  established  by  documentary  evidence  that,"
"owing to the Respondent’s conduct, its foreign supplier, Jg Containers"
"(Malaysia) SDN BHD, ceased supply, resulting in loss to the Appellant."
"Accordingly,  the  Appellants  contended  that their claim had been duly"
"established,  and  they  are  entitled  to  the  reliefs  prayed  for  in  their"
"Answer."
"The Respondent in their written submissions contended that the High"
"Court 
entered 
the 
judgment 
in 
favour  of 
the  Respondent.  The"
"Respondent  stated 
that 
the  Appellants  case 
is  mala 
fide 
in 
the"
"Appellants takes up two contrary positions:"
"(i)  that  the  Appellant  was  dealing  with  the  Respondent’s  principal  in"
"Malaysia"
