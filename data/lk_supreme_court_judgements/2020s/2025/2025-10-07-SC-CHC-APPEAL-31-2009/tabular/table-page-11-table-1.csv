"recover  the  same.  The  Respondent  has  produced  all relevant invoices"
"and delivery notes, which stand unchallenged, as their witnesses were"
"not  cross-examined on any of the documents marked on behalf of the"
"Respondent."
"The  Respondent  further  submits  that  the  Appellant’s  own  claim  in"
"reconvention  for  defective  and  delayed  deliveries  reinforces  that  the"
"contract 
for  sale  of  goods  was  between 
the  Respondent  and  the"
"Appellant, and not between the Appellant and the Malaysian principal."
"The Respondent specifically denied that the Respondent ever agreed to"
"the  Appellant  remitting  monies  directly  to  the  Malaysian  supplier.  At"
"no stage did the Appellant document such an agreement. Being a large"
"multinational  company, 
if  such  an  arrangement  had 
in  fact  been"
"reached, 
the  Appellant  would  undoubtedly  have 
reduced 
it 
into"
"writing."
"It  is  the  Respondent's  position  that  the  letter  marked  P8,  issued  on"
"6th  September  2004,  merely  two  days  after  the  purported  meeting  of"
"4th 
September,  makes 
no 
reference  whatsoever 
to 
any 
such"
"arrangement.  On  the  contrary,  it  expressly  acknowledges  liability  to"
"the  Respondent.  Notably,  the  letter  was  signed  by  Mr.  Rajanathan,"
"Supplies  Manager  of  the  Appellant,  who  was  present  at  the  alleged"
"meeting.  Had  such  an  agreement  been reached on 4th September, he"
"would  not  have  signed  a  letter  admitting  liability  to  the  Respondent"
"only two days later."
"Further, 
the 
Respondent 
averred 
that, 
despite 
the 
extensive"
"correspondence  exchanged  between  the  parties,  the  Appellant  made"
"no  mention  of  any  agreement  arising  out  of  a  meeting  on  4th"
"September  2004.  The  first  occasion  on which the Appellant sought to"
"advance  this  version  was  only  after  receipt  of  the  Respondent’s  letter"
