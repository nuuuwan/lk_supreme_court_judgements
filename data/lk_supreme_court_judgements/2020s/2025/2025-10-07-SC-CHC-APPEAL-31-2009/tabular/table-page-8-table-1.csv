"party named in, nor a signatory to, the agreement, it was pursuant to"
"the  arrangement  between  the  Respondent  and  the  Appellant  that  the"
"Sales Agreement marked “V8” came into existence."
"It  was  the  Appellants contention that it was common ground that the"
"Appellant  had  settled the monies claimed by Jg Containers (Malaysia)"
"SDN BHD under the said letter, but the Respondent failed to remit the"
"same to Jg Containers (Malaysia) SDN BHD."
"The Appellants emphasised the significance of the meeting held on 4th"
"September  2004.  The  representative  of  Jg  Containers  (Malaysia) SDN"
"BHD, as well as other witnesses of the Appellant, confirmed that such"
"a meeting took place. Two of the three parties present, testified that an"
"arrangement was reached whereby, in the event the Respondent failed"
"to  pay 
the  outstanding  USD  235,869.78,  the  Appellant  would  be"
"entitled 
to  make  such  payment.  The  Appellants  submitted 
that"
"although 
this  understanding  was  not  subsequently  confirmed 
in"
"writing,  the  Learned  Trial  Judge  erred  in  law  in  failing  to  recognise"
"that  this  was  the natural and ordinary course of events arising out of"
"the meeting of 4th September 2004."
"The Appellants further submitted that the Learned Trial Judge, having"
"observed  that the Respondent’s witness was not truthful, erred in law"
"in  nonetheless  entering  judgment  in  favour  of  the  Respondent.  They"
"argued  that if payment is now ordered to be made to the Respondent,"
"the Appellant would effectively be required to make double payment in"
"respect of the same liability. It was undisputed that the Appellant had"
"already  settled  the  sums  due  by  the  Respondent  to  Jg  Containers"
"(Malaysia)  SDN  BHD.  A  further  payment  to  the  Respondent  would"
"unjustly  enrich  the  Respondent  in  the  sum  of  Rs.  17,982,358.38,  to"
"the detriment of the Appellant."
