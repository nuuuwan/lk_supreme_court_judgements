"Atukorale, J. dealing with strongly condemns torture while in police custody in the"
"following manner;"
"“This   court   cannot,   in   the   discharge   of   its   constitutional   duty,"
"countenance any attempt by any police officer however high or low, to"
"conceal or distort the truth induced, perhaps, by a false sense of police"
"solidarity.   The   facts   of   this   case   have   revealed   disturbing   features"
"regarding third degree methods adopted by certain police officers on"
"suspects held in police custody. Such methods can, only be described as"
"barbaric, savage and inhuman. They are most revolting to one’s sense"
"of human decency and dignity particularly at the present time when"
"every endeavour is being made to promote and protect human rights."
"Nothing shocks the conscience of a man so much as the cowardly act of"
"a   delinquent   police   officer   who   subjects   a   helpless   suspect   in   his"
"charge   to   depraved   and   barbarous   methods   of   treatment   within   the"
"confines   of   the   very   premises   in   which   he   is   held   in   custody.   Such"
"action on the part of the police will only breed contempt for the law"
"and will tend to make the public lose confidence in the ability of the"
"police to maintain law and order. The petitioner may be a hard-core"
"criminal   whose   tribe   deserve   no   sympathy.   But   if   constitutional"
"guarantees are to have any meaning or value in our democratic set up,"
"it is essential that he be not denied the protection guaranteed by our"
"Constitution.”"
