"As correctly pointed out by Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J in Chandana Suriyarachchi"
"and Others v  Secretary Ministry of Defence and others,14"
"“[I]t   must   be   appreciated   that   the   investigational,   inquisitorial   and"
"dispute resolution mechanisms created by the HRCSL Act is aimed at"
"inter-alia providing the public a mechanism to which they may have"
"convenient and expeditious access for the resolution of disputes arising"
"out   of   the   alleged   infringement   of   their   fundamental   rights   and   to"
"obtain relief, without having to access the Constitutional mechanism by"
"invoking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. In the circumstances,"
"for the purpose of having fundamental rights related disputes resolved"
"and to obtain relief, if they choose to, the public need not go through"
"what is now observable as being a cumbersome, complicated, time-"
"consuming and possibly expensive method of judicial adjudication of"
"disputes.”"
