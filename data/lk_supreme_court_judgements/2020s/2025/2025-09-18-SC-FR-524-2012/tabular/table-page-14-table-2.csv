"human being and amounts to ‘degrading treatment’ within the meaning"
"of Article 11.”"
"The   conduct   complained   of   in   the   case   at   hand,   as   I   have   already   noted   above,"
"includes infliction of  severe  pain and suffering to the Petitioner accompanied by"
"humiliation of torturing him while stripping him naked."
"The   Medico-Legal   Report   that   has   been   tendered   before   this   Court,   supports   the"
"Petitioner’s version of the facts of the case rather than 1st to 5th Respondents’ version."
"According   to   the   Judicial   Medical   Officer   (JMO),   the   statement   made   by   the"
"Petitioner at the time of being admitted to Kurunegala teaching hospital is compatible"
"with the history of the injuries. Further MLR identifies around 11 injuries in the body"
"of the Petitioner where one of which has been identified as an injury that falls within"
"the category of grievous injury. “foot drop of right led [sic]- he cannot walk properly"
"with right foot due to nerve damage and temporary paralysis”."
"HRCSL  following   an   investigation   and   upon   examination   of   images   of   injuries"
"submitted by the Petitioner, notes that statements made by 1 st  to 5th  Respondents"
"regarding  the  Petitioner’s  injuries  that  were  reported  in  the  MLR   were   owing  to"
"Petitioner jumping out of the moving vehicle is not compatible with the nature and"
"the situation of the injuries in question. The HRCSL is in the opinion that these"
"injuries are result of a torture inflicted upon the Petitioner."
"When   considering   all   the   evidences   tendered   before   this   Court   together   with   the"
"observation of the HRCSL, I am of the opinion that the Petitioner has been subjected"
"to ‘torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’ within the"
"meaning of Article 11 of the Constitution."
