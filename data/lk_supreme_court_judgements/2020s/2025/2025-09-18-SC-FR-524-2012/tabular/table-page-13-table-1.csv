"“Article   11   of   our   Constitution   mandates   that   no   person   shall   be"
"subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or"
"punishment. It prohibits every person from inflicting torturesome, cruel"
"or inhuman treatment on another. It is an absolute fundamental right"
"subject to no restrictions or limitations whatsoever. Every person in"
"this country, be he a criminal or not, is entitled to this right to the"
"fullest content of its guarantee. Constitutional safeguards are generally"
"directed against the State and its organs. The police force being an"
"organ   of   the   State   is   enjoined   by   the   Constitution   to   secure   and"
"advance this right and not to deny, abridge or restrict the same in any"
"manner and under any circumstances. Just as much as this right is"
"enjoyed by every member of the police force, so is he prohibited from"
"denying the same to others, irrespective of their standing, their beliefs"
"or   antecedents.   It   is   therefore   the   duty   of   this   court   to   protect   and"
"defend this right jealously to its fullest measure with a view to ensuring"
"that this right which is declared and intended to be fundamental is"
"always kept fundamental and that the executive by its action does not"
"reduce it to a mere illusion.”"
"The ‘cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment’ is not limited to the physical force used"
"or any physical pain thereby caused but also extend to dignity of a person as a human"
"being.   Therefore,   in   the   case   of  Subasinghe   v   Police   Constable   Sandun   and"
