"In the case Gerald Mervin Perera v. Suraweera, Officer-In-Charge, Police Station"
"Wattala and Others12  Court held that,"
"“Further,   had   the   Respondents   been   acting   bona   fide   when   they"
"arrested   the   Petitioner,   they   would   have   promptly   recorded   his"
"statement,   and   would   then   have   either   produced   him   before   a"
"Magistrate   or   released   him.   The   fact   that   they   failed   to   record   a"
"statement (or if the IB extracts are accurate, waited ten hours to do so)"
"strongly suggests that they did not, even subjectively, believe that he"
"had   committed   an   offence,   but   were   merely   hoping   that   something"
"would turn up. It is also probable that the Petitioner was not given a"
"reason for arrest.”"
