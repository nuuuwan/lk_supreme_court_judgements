"were conducted in their personal capacity and not in the 'colour of"
"office.’.”"
"Deterrence   is   of   prime   importance   in   awarding   compensation   in   the   context   of"
"violations of fundamental rights, because the impugned conduct is the very action"
"that the framers of the Constitution sought to avoid. However, when a court awards"
"compensation against the state, it is ultimately the taxpayers’ money which is being"
"expended to make up for such commission or omission on the part of government"
"officials."
"Thus, I am of the opinion that, as the burden of compensation against the state has to"
"be born by ordinary tax payers, state should not  be imposed with the burden of"
"compensating the victims of such wrongful acts on the part of its errant officers"
"unless there is evidence to the effect that state through its omission is responsible for"
"encouraging or continuance of such discreditable conduct.  In the event the state has"
"proceeded   against   such   deviant   officers,   it   is   more   appropriate   for   the   court   to"
"directly hold the deviant officer personally liable rather than the state."
"In the instant case, as the state has fully co-operated to serve justice to the Petitioner"
"by instituting criminal proceedings in the High Court of Kurunegala against 1st to 3rd"
"Respondents in accordance with the provisions of the Convention against Torture and"
"other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act, No. 22 of 1994, I"
"hold that liability need not be imposed on the state for the wrongdoings of the 1st to"
"5th  Respondents   and   the   said   officers   themselves   are   personally   liable   for   their"
"discreditable conduct."
