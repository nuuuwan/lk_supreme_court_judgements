"","(ii) if the opposing party has objected to it being received as evidence on the"
"","deed or document being tendered in evidence but not objected at the close of"
"","a case when such document is read in evidence,"
"","the court shall admit such deed or document as evidence without requiring"
"","further proof;” [emphasis added.]"
"[21]","The above transitional provision applies to all cases and appeals pending as of"
"","the  date  the  law  came  into  force,  which  is  17th  of  February,  2022.  Since  this"
"","appeal was pending before this Court as of that date, the transitional provision"
"","applies  to  it  without  exception.  Accordingly,  I  am  compelled  to  apply  the"
"","procedural rules introduced by the amendment, regardless of whether the trial"
"","or appellate proceedings were concluded prior to the Amendment coming into"
"","force."
"[22]","This provision sets out two procedural conditions, under which, a deed that is"
"","required by law to be attested is deemed to be admitted into evidence without"
"","requiring further proof:"
"","(a)  where no objection was raised at the time the document was tendered;"
"","and"
"","(b)  Secondly,  where  an  objection  was 
raised  at  production  but  not"
"","maintained at the close of the opposing party’s case."
"","In either case, the court is required to treat the document as admitted and may"
"","not require the party to lead evidence of the attesting witnesses or further proof"
"","of execution."
