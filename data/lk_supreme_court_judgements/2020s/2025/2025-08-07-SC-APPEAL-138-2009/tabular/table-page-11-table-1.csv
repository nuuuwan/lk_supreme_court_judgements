this  Court  has  discussed 
the  effect  of

"","Amendment Act No. 17 of 2022, on established principles of law:"
"","“It is observable that this amendment to the Civil Procedure Code, has directly"
"","impacted  upon  the  principles  of 
law  which  are  contained 
in  the  earlier"
"","mentioned 
judgments.  The  amendment 
seems 
to  have  given 
statutory"
"","recognition to the cursus curiae of original courts pertaining to the production"
"","and proof of documents such as deeds required by law to be attested. When"
"","legislative  provisions  are 
inconsistent  with 
legal  principles  contained 
in"
"","previous judicial precedent, courts are obliged to apply subsequent legislative"
"","provisions which  may have impliedly repealed legal  principles contained  in"
"","such  previous 
judicial  precedent.  That 
is  a 
fundamental 
legal  principle"
"","recognized in common law jurisdictions including Sri Lanka.”"
