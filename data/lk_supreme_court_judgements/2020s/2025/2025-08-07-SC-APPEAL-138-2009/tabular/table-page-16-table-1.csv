"","exercise  its  discretion  to  make  a  declaration  in  favour  of  a  party  who  has"
"","divested himself of all interest in the subject-matter of the action.”"
"[42]","This position was reaffirmed in De Silva vs. Goonetileke8, where the Plaintiff"
"","brought  a  rei  vindicatio  action  against  a  municipal  council.  During 
the"
"","proceedings, the property  was  vested  in  the municipal  council  under  statute."
"","Although the Council agreed to reconvey the property to whoever succeeded in"
"","the action, the Court held that the Plaintiff’s title had ceased and that he could"
"","not maintain the action. Abrahams C.J. stated:"
"","“It  is  clear 
law  that  in  an  action  rei  vindicatio  the  plaintiff  must  have"
"","dominium. A party claiming a declaration of title must have title himself. He"
"","cannot maintain an action for a declaration of title to a property the title to"
"","which is vested in someone else. If he cannot, the action will not lie.”"
"[43]","As  observed  above,  previous  decisions  of 
this  Court  make 
it  clear 
that"
"","‘ownership’ forms the very foundation of a rei vindicatio action. Therefore, an"
"","unequivocal  loss  of  title  during  the  pendency  of  proceedings  is  sufficient  to"
"","warrant  a  departure  from the general rule that the rights  of parties are  to  be"
"","determined as at the date of institution."
"[44]","Legal principles dictate that when a party who has lost title during the pendency"
"","of proceedings cannot maintain an action in rei vindicatio. Since ownership is"
"","the foundation of such an action, the loss of title, whenever it occurs, must result"
"","in the failure to pursue the claim. To hold otherwise would serve no practical"
"","purpose, as the Plaintiff no longer holds title and cannot be placed in possession"
