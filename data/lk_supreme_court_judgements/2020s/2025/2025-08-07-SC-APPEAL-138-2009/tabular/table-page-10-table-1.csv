"[23]","Prior 
to 
this 
amendment, 
courts  were  guided  by 
authorities 
such 
as"
"","Amerasinghe 
Arachchige 
Don 
Dharmaratne 
vs. 
Dodangodage"
"","Premadasa1,  where  this  Court  held  that  formal  proof  was  necessary  where"
"","execution  was 
in 
issue,  and 
in  Francis  Samarawickrema  vs.  Hilda"
"","Jayasinghe2, the Court imposed a higher burden of proof on deeds challenged"
"","on the ground of fraud. In both cases, the courts treated the absence of formal"
"","proof as a failure to satisfy the burden of proof placed on the parties."
"[24]","As  the  law  stood  at  the  time  of  the  trial  and  the  High  Court  appeal,  these"
"","principles  remained  fully in  force.  Therefore,  both the District Court  and  the"
"","Civil Appellate High Court were duty-bound to examine whether the Deed of"
"","Gift  had  been  duly  executed 
in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the"
"","Evidence Ordinance and prevailing judicial authority at the time."
"[25]","However,  I  observe  that  neither  court  conducted  such  an  examination.  The"
"","District  Court  accepted  the  Deed  of  Gift  without  the  attesting  witnesses'"
"","testimony  or reasoning the Plaintiff’s failure to call  the donor, who was alive"
"","and  accessible  to  testify  at  the  time.  The  High  Court,  for  its  part,  focused"
"","primarily on procedural aspects but did not address the Plaintiff’s title."
"[26]","On  any  substantive  analysis  prior  to  the  2022  Amendment,  this  deed  of  gift"
"","would have failed the test of proof under the Evidence Ordinance and prevailing"
"","case law. Although a more detailed examination of the evidence may have been"
"","appropriate, considering the issues raised and the nature of the dispute, now"
