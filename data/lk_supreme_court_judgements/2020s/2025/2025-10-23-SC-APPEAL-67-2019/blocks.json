The \ufb02aw in the prayer to the plaint had been rec\u019f\ufb01ed by raising issues having a nexus to the rights of the Plain\u019f\ufb00s under the permits and their consequen\u019fal right to the ejectment of the Defendant. As pointed out by G.P.S. De Silva, J [as he then was] in Hana\ufb03 v. Nallamma [(1998) 1 Sri LR 73], \u201cOnce issues are framed the case which the court has to hear and determine becomes crystallized in the issues and the pleadings recede to the background.\u201d 8) The 1st Plain\u019f\ufb00, the Surveyor who prepared Commission Plan No. 4393, an o\ufb03cer from the Land Commissioner\u2019s Department and two Grama Niladhari O\ufb03cers gave evidence on behalf of the Plain\u019f\ufb00s. The Defendant gave evidence on his behalf and led the evidence of two persons who had worked for the Defendant on the land that the Defendant is said to have encroached. The Defendant too had obtained a commission to survey the land and even though Plan No. 732/92 prepared pursuant to the commission and the Report of the Surveyor had been marked, the Defendant did not lead the evidence of the Surveyor. 9) Commission Plan No. 4393 contained 14 lots, with the Defendant admi\u01abng in his evidence that he is in occupa\u019fon of Lot Nos. 13 and 14 thereof, in extent of 1A 3R 35P, which lots formed part of the land referred to in the permits issued to the Plain\u019f\ufb00s. It is noted that even though the land situated to the east of Lot No. 13 is State land and has been cul\u019fvated by the Defendant, he did not present any permit in respect of the land situated to the east of Lot No. 13 or any other permit other than the aforemen\u019foned annual permit issued in 1980, thus raising a doubt whether the land referred to in the said permit issued to the Defendant is in fact the land situated to the east of Lot No. 13.",

Hence, this appeal by the Defendant. There is no dispute that the two permits issued to the Plain\u019f\ufb00s were issued in 1963 and 1970 whereas the defendant was issued a permit in 1980. This was done without lawfully cancelling the two permits issued to the Plain\u019f\ufb00s. In Wimala Herath (deceased) Sarathchandra Rajapaksha and others v Kamalawathie and another [(2013) 2 Sri LR 60] there were two permits issued under the Ordinance in rela\u019fon to the same State land and the Supreme Court held that it is only a\u014cer cancella\u019fon of the \ufb01rst permit on lawful grounds that the land could be divided and separate permits be issued for the divided por\u019fons.

It is a recognized principle that when a plain\u019f\ufb00 has asked for a greater relief than he is actually en\u019ftled to, it should not prevent him from ge\u01abng the lesser relief which he is en\u019ftled to. \u2018Non debet cui plus licet quod minus est non licere\u2019: the greater includes the less. This is a well-established principle in law and also in consonance with common sense.\u201d 33) Thus, even if the Plain\u019f\ufb00s had not amended the prayer, I am of the view that the",
