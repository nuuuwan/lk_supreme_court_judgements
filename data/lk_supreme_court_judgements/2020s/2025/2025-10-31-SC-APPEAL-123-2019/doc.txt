A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

This matter arises from an Appeal filed by the Defendant-Respondent-

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”) challenging the

Judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court of Kandy dated 26/10/2018, which

allowed the Appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred

to as the “Respondent”), and awarded damages in the sum of Rs. 100,000/- for

Malicious Prosecution.

The Respondent instituted action in the District Court of Kandy in Case No.

35999/06, seeking damages for losses sustained due to the Appellant’s

malicious institution of criminal proceedings against her. The criminal

proceedings in question stemmed from Case No. 96483 filed by the Appellant

in the Magistrate’s Court of Kandy by way of a Private Plaint, alleging that the

Respondent had violated a ‘settlement agreement’ in Case No. 32000 filed in

the Magistrate’s Court of Kandy, for obstructing a roadway granted to the

Appellant.

The Appellant alleged that the Respondent had dumped garbage on the said

roadway, shouting at persons using the roadway, and throwing stones at a

Page 4 of 10

moving vehicle. Based on the said allegations, the Respondent was charged

under Section 73 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979. The

learned Magistrate, by Judgment dated 11/07/2003, found the Respondent

guilty as charged.

However, upon appeal, the High Court of Kandy, by Judgment dated

22/09/2004, acquitted the Respondent, held inter alia that:

● the alleged conduct, if at all, should have been prosecuted under the

Penal Code,

● there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the Respondent had

obstructed the roadway or violated the said settlement, and therefore

could not be found guilty under Section 73 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

Following the acquittal, the Respondent instituted the present action in the

District Court of Kandy for malicious prosecution. The Appellant sought a

dismissal of the action and brought a counter claim seeking Rs. 2,000,000/- in

damages, alleging that the Respondent’s civil action before the District Court

constituted malicious conduct.

The Learned Additional District Judge of Kandy, by Judgment dated

12/06/2015, dismissed both the Respondent’s action and the Appellant’s claim

in reconvention. The Court held, inter alia, that since the Respondent’s cause

of action accrued on the date of conviction, the action was time-barred. The

court held that the Appellant failed to establish malice or quantify losses

sustained. The court was also of the view that the Appellant failed to lead

evidence in support of his claim in reconvention.

Aggrieved by the said Judgment, the Respondent appealed to the Civil Appeals

High Court of Kandy (“the Appellate Court”). The Appellate Court, by Judgment

Page 5 of 10

dated 26/10/2018, allowed the appeal and awarded the Respondent Rs.

100,000/- in damages. The Appellate Court held that the Respondent’s action

was not prescribed. The court was of the view that the Appellant’s conduct in

filing a Private Plaint despite the absence of material to support a charge under

Section 73 constituted animus injuriandi.

The Appellant is before this Court to have the said Judgement of the Appellate

Court set aside. Leave to Appeal was granted by this Court on the following

question of law:

“Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law when

they concluded that there is evidence of malice or animus injuriandi in

the institution of the case bearing number 96483?”

LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ANALYSIS

English law defines malicious prosecution as the wrongful initiation of criminal

proceedings without reasonable and probable cause, and with malice, resulting

in damage to the claimant. W. V. H. Rogers’ Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort

(page 864), defines malicious prosecution as “the abuse of legal process by

setting the law in motion on a criminal charge without reasonable and

probable cause and with malice.”

Malicious prosecution in Sri Lanka, though influenced in terminology by

common law, derives its substantive standing from Roman-Dutch law.

Malicious prosecution is treated as a species of the broader actio iniuriarum in

Roman-Dutch law, which protects an individual’s personality rights, including

dignity, reputation, and bodily integrity. An action can be brought when legal

proceedings have been instituted without reasonable and probable cause or

actuated by malice or animus injuriandi. A cause of action lies where criminal

proceedings are instituted maliciously and without probable cause.

Page 6 of 10

Under the Roman-Dutch law, the concept is not confined to the strict elements

of malicious prosecution as developed under English law. It is sufficiently

flexible to encompass claims founded upon any misuse or abuse of the legal

process. Cooray v Fernando [1941] 42 NLR. 329, distinguishes Roman-

Dutch law from English law, noting that the former allows actions for malicious

proceedings beyond formal prosecutions, including maintenance claims and

other civil processes.

A. H. M. D. Nawaz J. reaffirmed in SC/APPEAL/52/2017 (Supreme Court

minutes dated 23/08/2024), that the law relating to malicious prosecution in

Sri Lanka is rooted in Roman-Dutch law rather than English common law. His

Lordship cited Alwis v Ahangama [2000] 3 Sri LR 226, where Mark

Fernando J. emphasised that attempts to confine the delict to the English law

concept of malicious prosecution had been rejected. The Court highlighted that

under Roman-Dutch law, the broader action of actio injuriarum governs such

wrongs, encompassing malicious or wrongful disciplinary or administrative

proceedings. Accordingly, the Sri Lankan approach emphasises the elements of

injury, malice, and absence of reasonable cause, and is not limited to instances

of criminal or judicial prosecution as recognised in English law.

The essential elements required to establish an action for malicious prosecution

under Roman-Dutch law was reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal in Kalu Banda

v. Rajakaruna [2002] 3 Sri L.R. 44, as;

a) The defendant instituted the criminal proceedings.

b) The proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff.

c) The defendant acted without reasonable and probable cause.

d) The defendant acted with malice (animus injuriandi).

e) The plaintiff suffered damage.

As R. G. McKerron observed in “The Law of Delict” (page 261),

Page 7 of 10

“In order to succeed in an action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff

must show that the defendant instituted or instigated the proceedings, that

he acted without reasonable and probable cause, that he was actuated by

malice, and that the proceedings terminated in the plaintiff’s favour.”

This formulation has been consistently endorsed in Sri Lankan jurisprudence

and serves as the benchmark against which such claims must be evaluated. The

burden lies squarely on the Plaintiff to establish each of these elements on a

balance of probability. Failure to do so in respect of any one element is fatal to

the claim.

In Silva v Silva [2002] 2 Sri LR. 29, Shiranee Tilakawardane, J emphasised

that;

“(1) In a case of malicious prosecution, the onus of proof is on the

plaintiff, he must prove/on a preponderance of evidence or on a balance

of probabilities that -

i. there was a prosecution on a charge that was false.

ii. such prosecution was instituted maliciously or with animus

injuriandi and not with a view to vindicate public justice.

iii. there was want of reasonable or probable cause for such action.

iv. the prosecution terminated in favour of the plaintiff as against the

complainant.

(2) The burden to prove that the action was filed maliciously was on the

plaintiff.

(3) Malice is a feature of the mind and must be gathered from the

circumstances. One should not presume the existence of a delict so long

as it is possible to suppose the contrary.

Page 8 of 10

(4) An animus injuriandi cannot be presumed from the fact that the

prosecution was found to be false and that the accused had been

acquitted.”

In the instant case, it is pertinent to note that under cross-examination, the

Respondent did not deny the act of dumping garbage onto the entranceway of

the Appellant’s land on 06/04/2002.

Such conduct, particularly in the context of a prior court-sanctioned settlement

agreement prohibiting the dumping of garbage on the roadway, is not merely

inconsiderate but provocative. It is a form of conduct that would reasonably

instigate a grievance to a recipient. Importantly, the Appellant did not retaliate

with aggression or confrontation. Instead, he sought legal redress by first

lodging a complaint with the police, and thereafter, upon the police declining to

take action, by instituting proceedings before the Magistrate’s Court, as any

reasonable person would have done in similar circumstances.

In evaluating whether the Appellant acted with reasonable and probable cause,

it must be emphasised that the Respondent was convicted by the learned

Magistrate following a full inter partes trial. Her subsequent acquittal was not

based on a finding of innocence, but rather on a technicality that the garbage

was thrown on the Appellant’s land and not on the access road. This distinction,

while legally significant, does not negate the factual basis of the complaint nor

the Appellant’s bona fide belief in the legitimacy of his grievance.

The learned District Judge rightly recognised this nuance and held that the

Respondent was discharged solely based on the location where the garbage was

dumped. Irrespective of whether the garbage was thrown onto the access road

or the Appellant’s land, such conduct was of a nature sufficiently provocative to

warrant a complaint being made to the authorities. The District Court correctly

concluded that the Appellant’s actions were not motivated by malice but were

instead an act in good faith to vindicate his rights. Accordingly, the Respondent

Page 9 of 10

has failed to establish that the Appellant acted with animus injuriandi or that

the prosecution was founded on falsehood.

It is therefore clear that the institution of Case No. 96438 by the Appellant was

not malicious. The Appellant acted on a reasonable and probable belief that his

rights had been infringed, and the proceedings were initiated in good faith. The

acquittal of the Respondent was not a reflection of the falsity of the complaint

but a technical determination on the locus of the alleged act.

Despite these compelling circumstances, the learned Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court attributed malice to the Appellant. The reasoning was

premised on the assertion that the police did not file charges under Section 73

of the Primary Courts Procedure Act and that the Appellant proceeded

independently by filing a private plaint. The Appellate Court inferred malice

from the Appellant’s decision to institute legal proceedings without the

endorsement of the police.

However, in reaching this conclusion, the Appellate Court failed to consider

that;

a) the Respondent did, in fact, dump garbage on the Appellant’s

entranceway,

b) the conduct of the Respondent was provocative and instigating,

c) the Appellant had ample reason to believe he had a reasonable and

probable cause to initiate proceedings,

d) the Respondent’s acquittal was based solely on a technicality,

e) an acknowledgment by the Appellant that the Respondent could have

been charged under an alternative provision of the Penal Code,

f) the prosecution by the Appellant was not based on false facts,

g) the Respondent has failed to establish the requisite elements of

malicious prosecution.

CONCLUSIONS

For the foregoing reasons, it is comprehensible that the Appellant has

convincingly demonstrated that he did not act with malice. The conclusions

drawn by the Appellate Court are therefore rendered incorrect, unsupported by

the evidentiary record, and legally untenable.

Accordingly, I hold that the Respondent has failed to establish the essential

elements of malicious prosecution. In all the above circumstances, I answer the

question of law referred to earlier in the Judgment in the affirmative, and set

aside the Judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated 26/10/2018. The

Judgment of the Learned Additional District Judge of Kandy dated 12/06/2015

is hereby affirmed.

Appeal allowed.
