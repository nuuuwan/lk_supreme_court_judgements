"Janak De Silva, J"
"""Where any person suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of"
"the fault of any other person or persons a claim in respect of that damage shall not"
"be  defeated  by  reason  of  the  fault  of  the  person  suffering  the  damage,  but  the"
"damages recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced to such extent as the Court"
"thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant's share in responsibility for"
"the damage ...""."
