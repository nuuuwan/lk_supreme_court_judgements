"Janak De Silva, J"
"middle of the road coupled with the fact that there was a single white line in the middle"
"of the road near the place of the accident justifies an inference of negligence on his part."
"The island was constructed in the middle of a pedestrian crossing. The Plaintiff admitted"
"that he drives very often on this road and had observed the construction prior to the day"
"of the accident."
"The  Plaintiff  contended  that  the  yellow  beacon  lights  near  the  construction  were  not"
"operating and that the area should have been illuminated for the users of the road to"
"know of the existence of the said island which is an obstruction to the users of the road."
"However, this overlooks the fact that the Defendant had the benefit of the lights of the"
"car driven by him. Unlike a hole in the middle of the road which may cause difficulty in"
"identifying in the absence of any warning, an island constructed on the middle of a road"
"providing motorists about 21 feet wide road to travel on coupled with the admission of"
"the Plaintiff that he had observed the construction prior to the day of the accident imputes"
"negligence on the part of the Plaintiff."
"For the foregoing reasons, I answer question of law No. iii in the affirmative and hold that"
"the accident took place due to the negligence on the part of the Plaintiff for having driven"
"his vehicle over the speed limit without a proper lookout."
"I part with this judgment with some anguish. The Plaintiff was responding to an urgent"
"call to attend to a patient in a critical condition. He was undoubtedly seeking to give effect"
"to  the  Hippocratic  oath  he  was  obliged  to  act  upon.  Unfortunately,  he  met  with  an"
"accident in the process and suffered serious injury."
"Nevertheless, court is not exercising just and equitable jurisdiction. It must determine the"
"case by applying the law according to the facts and circumstances of the case."
