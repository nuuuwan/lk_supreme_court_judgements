"","island many times. While this itself is not sufficient to draw an inference of negligence"
"","on the part of the Plaintiff, it is also clear from his evidence that the Plaintiff had driven"
"","above the speed limit under such conditions he himself claimed to be poorly lit."
"35.  Moreover, the road in question is fourteen meters wide and has four lanes, with two lanes",""
"","each going in each direction. Had the Plaintiff driven on the left lane, as he ought to,"
"","without moving well into the middle lane, he would not have hit the centre island—for"
"","the centre island only covered the inward parts of the middle lanes."
"36.  When all such is said but the term ‘contributory negligent’ itself, I do not think a judge",""
"","must necessarily close his mind to any and all fault on the part of those who make the"
"","claim. 
I  take  the  view  that,  where  negligent  elements 
in  a  Plaintiff’s  conduct  are"
"","established by evidence and a defendant has brought the same to the notice of the court,"
"","such  court  may  activate  the  machinery  in  the  1968  Act  and  proceed  to  reduce  the"
"","damages recoverable as it deems just and equitable."
"37.","In  the  case  at  hand,  the  part  the  Plaintiff  himself  has  played  in  the  accident  is  hardly"
"","negligible. A motorist has a duty to observe reasonable care, especially when conditions"
"","are such that they could induce mistakes. This, however, does not abrogate the duty of"
"","the Defendant Council to take all such measures as may be necessary to give due notice"
"","of the structure to those who use the road."
"38.  As such, I am of the view that, while the conclusions of the learned Judges of the High",""
"","Court  of  Civil  Appeal  and  the  District  that  the  Defendant  had  been  negligent  is  not"
"","erroneous, they have erred in holding that the Defendant had been solely negligent."
"39.","Issues Nos. 20 (අ), (ආ) and 21(අ) in the District Court judgment are as follows, and they"
"","have all been answered in the negative by the District Judge:"
