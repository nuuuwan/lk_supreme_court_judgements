"Commissions v. Gourley [(1956) A.C. 185.]"
"It was decided there that in assessing damages, in an action for personal injuries. For"
"the  loss  of  actual  or  prospective  earnings,  the  Court  must  take  account  of  the"
"plaintiff’s  net  earnings  after  deduction  of  tax,  and  not  his  gross  earnings.  The"
"principle applied was that the plaintiff in such a case should be awarded such a sum"
"of money as will put him in the same position as he would have been if he had not"
"sustained the injuries, and it would therefore be wrong to award the plaintiff a sum"
"without regard to the amount of tax for which would be liable."
"The  case  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  other  principle  that  I  referred  to,  “that  the"

"that  sum  of  money  because  of  the  accident,  but  because  he  has  made  contract"
"providing for this contingency; an accident mist occur to entitled him to it, but it is"
"not the accident but his contract which is the cause of his receiving it”."
"Another  view  is  that  a  wrongdoer  should  not  get  the  benefit  of  the  fortuitous"
"circumstance that the plaintiff was insured, and appropriate to himself the benefit of"
"the premiums paid by the plaintiff to cover accident risks. An editorial note in the"
"Law Quarterly Review, Vol. 72, page 154 says: “The rule concerning insurance is a"
"peculiar one, based on consideration of public policy”, and this is also the view of Mr."
