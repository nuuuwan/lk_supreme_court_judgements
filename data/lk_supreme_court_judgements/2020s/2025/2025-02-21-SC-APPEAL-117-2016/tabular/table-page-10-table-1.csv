"12 of 1968 provides that,"
"(a) Where any person suffers damage which is caused partly by his own fault and"
"partly by the fault of any other person, a claim in respect of that damage shall"
"not be defeated by reason only of the fault of the claimant, but the  damages"
"recoverable in respect thereof shall be reduced by the court to such extent"
"as  the  court  may  deem  just  and  equitable  having  regard  to  the  degree  in"
"which the claimant was at fault in relation to the damage."
