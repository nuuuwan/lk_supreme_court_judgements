"provides the following instructive exposition of the difference between an inference and"
"speculation or conjecture:"
"“Inference must be carefully distinguished from conjecture or speculation. There can"
"be no inference unless there are objective facts from which to infer the other facts"
"which it is sought to establish. In some cases the other facts can be inferred with as"
"much practical certainty as if they had been  actually observed. In other cases the"
"inference  does  not  go  beyond  reasonable  probability.  But  if  there  are  no  positive,"
"proved facts from which the inference can be made, the method of inference fails"
"and what is left is mere speculation or conjecture”."
