"Janak De Silva, J"
"called for the removal of these outdated legal provisions, as they no longer aligned with"
"the demands of modern life."
"The principle that an injured party who was partly responsible for his own harm could not"
"recover  damages  in  tort  would  remain  the  official  doctrine  in  England  until  the  Law"
"Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act of 1945. Section 1 (1) provided the rule that in such"
"cases the claim does not fail but the defence of contributory negligence may apply and if"
"it applies it may lead to a reduction of the amount of damages to be paid. This reduction"
"is based on the respective degrees of the responsibility of the parties. The question to be"
"answered is not only to what extent the behaviour involved was likely to cause the event,"
"but above all what is needed is a balancing of the respective faults by the judge. Ultimately"
"what is decisive is what the court/judge considers to be ‘just and equitable’. With the Law"
"Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act of 1945, the contributory negligence rule, with its"
"all-or-nothing approach, and the last opportunity rule became inoperative."
"The  legislature  in  South  Africa  enacted  the  Apportionment  of  Damages  Act,  No.  34  of"
"1956,  which  altered  the  law  both  in  respect  of  joint  liability  as  well  as  contributory"
"negligence, and as a result, the law in these two countries is more or less the same, on"
"contributory negligence."
"In  Ceylon  (as  it  was  then  known),  the  position  was  the  same  as  in  England  and  South"
"Africa. Thus, in Ahnolis Hamy v. Alagan (44 N.L.R. 303) Court held that in an action to"
"recover damages for injury caused to a workman, which was based on the negligence of"
"his  employer,  the  plaintiff  is  not  entitled  to  succeed,  where  has  himself  been  guilty  of"
"contributory negligence. The take all or leave all approach is also clear from  Perera v."
"Charles (49 N.L.R. 39) where the DC judge had dismissed the action on the ground that"
"the  plaintiff  had,  by  sitting  with  his  arm  protruding  from  the  bus,  being  guilty  of"
"contributory negligence."
