"Janak De Silva, J"
"The courts sought to mitigate the harshness of the rule, as was done in England and in"
"South Africa, by the application of such rules as ‘last opportunity’ and ‘proximate cause’."
"In several cases the last opportunity rule has been specifically referred to. Under this rule,"
"even if there is negligence on the part of the defendant, in the event the plaintiff has the"
"last opportunity to prevent the damage, the case would be dismissed with no damages"
"granted to the plaintiff. This can be seen in Daniel v. Cooray (42 N.L.R. 422) where the"
"court referred to the last opportunity rule and stated that in cases where the defendant"
"pleads contributory negligence the inquiry resolves itself in an elucidation of the question"
"as to which party, by the exercise of ordinary care, had the last opportunity of preventing"
"the occurrence."
"The Act was enacted to address two specific issues, apportionment of damages in cases"
"of joint liability and contributory negligence."
"The Act provided inter alia that an action shall not be defeated by reason only of the fault"
"of the claimant. The court has the power to apportion the damages as it may deem just"
"and equitable."
"Therefore,  the  Act  was  aimed  at  addressing  the  substantive  rules  governing  action  for"
"damages arising from a negligent act of the defendant. It was not aimed at amending any"
"procedural  rules  governing  such  actions.  The  procedural  rules  governing  all  actions,"
"including the need to specifically plead contributory negligence and raise it as an issue,"
"applies to such actions as well."
"In this context, it is apposite to observe that Section 1(1) of the Contributory Negligence"
"Act 1945 is the basis of all pleas of contributory negligence in England & Wales and reads"
"as follows:"
