"Janak De Silva, J"
"Our courts have also applied this maxim. [See Safenaumma v. Siddick (37 N.L.R. 25); Perera"
"v.  Amarasinghe  (Sub  Inspector  of  Police,  Ratnapura)  (supra);  Kalansuriya  v.  Johoran  (48"
"N.L.R. 400); The Trustees of Fraser Memorial Nursing Home v. Olney (45 N.L.R. 73); Wije Bus"
"Co.  Ltd.  v.  Soysa  (50  N.L.R.  350);  Cabral  v.  Alberatne  (57  N.L.R.  368);  Subawickrema  v."
"Samaranayake (1992) 1 Sri.L.R. 142; Punchi Singho v. Bogala Graphite Co. Ltd. (73 N.L.R."
"66), Dhammika Perera v. Nalinda Priyadharshana [(2013) 1 Sri.L.R. 155]."
"For example, in Kalansuriya v. Johoran (supra) the accused was driving a lorry, and the"
"evidence showed that the lorry left the road, went a distance of fifty feet and injured a"
"person standing eight feet away from the edge of the road. It was held that there was"
"prima facie evidence of negligence casting upon the accused the onus of proving that"
"there was no negligence."
"This maxim clearly has no application where the cause of the accident is known. As was"
"held in Barkway v. South Wales Transport Co. Ltd. [(1950) 1 All E.R. 392 (HL) at 394-"
"5] where the facts are sufficiently known, the question ceases to be one where the facts"
"speak for themselves,  and the solution is to  be found by determining whether, on the"
"facts as established, negligence is to be inferred or not [See Administrator Natal v. Stanley"
"Motors (1960) 1 SA 690 (A) at 700]."
"In this context, I note that one of the admissions recorded at the trial is that parties admit"
"the accident mentioned in the plaint. According to the plaint, the cause of the accident"
"was an island that had been constructed on the middle of the Havelock Road. It appears"
"that this island had been constructed as there had been a fatal accident at the place about"
"one week prior to the date of the incident."
"The evidence led on behalf of the Defendant establishes that  the width of the Havelock"
"Road at the place of the accident was 46 feet. It was divided into four lanes, two lanes"
"each way. The construction which was on the middle of the road was about 3 feet in width,"
