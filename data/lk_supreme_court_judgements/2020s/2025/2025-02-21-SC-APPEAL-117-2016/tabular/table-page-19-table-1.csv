"for the Court of Appeal, referring to McKerron, opined that,"
"“…By  their  very  nature  various  forms  of  non-  patrimonial  loss  such  as  pain  and"

"damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities of life. In awarding a lump sum"
"as damages when the wrong complained of constitutes personal injuries, it is difficult"
"to assess damages on a logical basis…”"
