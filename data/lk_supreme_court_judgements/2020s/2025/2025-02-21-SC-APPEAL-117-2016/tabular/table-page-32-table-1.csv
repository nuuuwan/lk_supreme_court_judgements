"Janak De Silva, J"
"The earliest reference to the maxim res ipsa loquitur in South African case law seems to"
"be  that  of  Gifford  v.  Table  Bay  Dock  and  Breakwater  Management  Commission"
"[(1874) 4 Buch 96]. The relevant facts indicate that the plaintiff in his capacity as Master"
"and Captain in command of a vessel known as The China instituted proceedings against"
"the defendants for the recovery of damages after The China had been wrecked when it"
"fell off a cradle of a patent slip which had been under the management and control of the"
"defendants at the time. De Villiers C.J. held that as there was evidence in this case of actual"
"negligence, the court did not consider it necessary to deal in detail with the question as"
"to  whether  the  accident  which  befell  The  China  was  of  such  a  nature  as  to  raise  a"
"presumption of negligence which would result in the casting of the burden of proof on"
"the defendants to repel the presumption."
"The  court  nevertheless  answered  the  question  as  to  the  defendantsâ€™  negligence  in  the"
"affirmative and after briefly referring to the Roman Law proceeded to discuss the legal"
"position in England and approved of the formulation of the doctrine by Erie C.J., in Scott"
"(supra)."
"Subsequently,  this  locus  classicus  has  been  approved  and  applied  in  South  Africa  [See"
