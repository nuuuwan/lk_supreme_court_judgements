"15.  The first question of law as well as the third question appear to arise out of the part of",""

"16.  This reasoning of the learned High Court Judge is erroneous for several reasons. Firstly,",""
"","it appears that the learned Judge has used the term ‘res ipsa loquitur’ rather casually and"
"","informally, without due regard to how the principle should apply. Needless to say, such"
"","nonchalant usage of legal nomenclature, especially such terms that carry with it broad"
"meanings, is far from ideal.",""
"17.  Res ipsa loquitur posits that where a thing is shown to be under the management and",""
"","control of a defendant, directly or indirectly, and the accident is such that it would not"
"","have occurred but for want of care, it leads to a reasonable inference of negligence on"
"","the part of a defendant, unless such defendant affords a reasonable explanation.4"

"","rise to the inference, it is no longer practically necessary for a plaintiff to lead evidence"
"","proving negligence, for there is no need to prove that which is self-evident. However,"
"where  the  defendant","is  able  to  provide  a  reasonable  explanation  to  displace  the"
"inference, the law once again places emphasis on the proof of negligence.",""
"19.  This burden of the defendant, where res ipsa loquitur is successfully invoked, to provide",""
"","a reasonable explanation must not be misperceived as a burden to prove positively that"

"learned High Court Judge of Civil Appeal.",""
"20.  Admittedly, many authorities can be found to advance the position that res ipsa loquitur",""
"","amounts to a presumption or, stronger yet, a rule that shifts the ultimate burden of proof"
