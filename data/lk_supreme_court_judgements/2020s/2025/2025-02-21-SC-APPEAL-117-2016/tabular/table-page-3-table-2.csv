"","THURAIRAJA, PC, J."
"1.","The case  stems  from the misfortune the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter"
"","the ‘Plaintiff) had to endure in the wee hours of the 23rd morning of August 1999, when"
"","he, a vascular surgeon and a professor of Surgery at the Colombo Medical Faculty, had"
"","set  off  to  the  General  Hospital  of  Colombo  in  a rush  having  been  summoned  for"
"","emergency surgery at around 3 a.m."
"2.","As he drove down the familiar Havelock Road, he had collided with an island in the centre"
"","of that road newly constructed by the Defendant-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter the"
"","‘Defendant’), Colombo Municipal Council. In a twisted turn of fate, the Plaintiff was then"
"","rushed to the General Hospital for treatment, having suffered serious injuries, particularly"
"","to  his  spine.  The  injury  to  his  spine  was  described  as  permanent—and  such  would"
"","naturally be a great hindrance to any surgeon in their profession."
"3.","The permanence of the injury is well established by the medical reports presented before"
"","the  District  Court  as  well  as  by  the  testimony  of  Dr.  Vasantha  Perera,  Consultant"
"","Orthopaedic, who treated the Plaintiff when he was admitted to the Hospital."
"4.","The Plaintiff  states that he was warded  for treatment at the Hospital for  five days. He"
"","states that thereafter he was with a POP cast for a period of two months and a removable"
"","brace for a further period of two months. He had then gone to England for two years on"
