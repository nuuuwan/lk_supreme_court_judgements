"","Janak De Silva, J"
"I find much merit in the following principles expounded by Kroon, J. in  Stacey v. Kent",""
"[(1995) 3 SA 344 at 352] on the application of the maxim res ipsa loquitur:",""
"(1) The rule gives rise to an inference, not a presumption, of negligence.",""
"","(2) The  court  is  not  compelled  to  draw  the  inference.  At  the  end  of  the  case,  the"
"","enquiry is where, on all the evidence, the balance of probabilities lies."
"","(3) If it is substantially in favour of the party bearing the  onus on the pleadings, he"
"succeeds; if not he fails.",""
"","(4) Once the plaintiff proves the occurrence giving rise to the inference of negligence"
"","on the part of the defendant, the latter must adduce evidence to the contrary. He"
"","must  tell  the  remainder  of  the  story,  or  take  the  risk  of  judgment  being  given"
"against him.",""
"(5) How  far  the  defendantâ€™s  evidence  needs  to  go  to  displace  the","inference  of"
"","negligence  arising  from  proof  of  the  occurrence  depends  upon  the  facts  of  the"
"particular case.",""
"","(6) Mere  theories,  or  hypothetical  suggestions  will  not  avail  the  defendant.  His"
"","explanation  must  have  some  substantial  foundation  in  fact  and  the  evidence"
"","produced must be sufficient to destroy the probability of negligence inferred to be"
"","present prior to the testimony adduced by him. There is, however, no onus on the"
"defendant 
to  establish","the  correctness  of  his  explanation  on  a  balance  of"
"probabilities.",""
"","(7) The enquiry at the conclusion of the case remains whether the plaintiff has, on a"
"","balance of probabilities, discharged the onus of establishing that the collision was"
"","caused by negligence attributable to the defendant. In that enquiry the explanation"
"","tendered by the defendant will be tested by considerations such as probability and"
"credibility.",""
