"factors which must be taken into account, Sansoni, J. (as His Lordship then was) opined"
"as follows:"
"“The plaintiff is a doctor in Government Service who has practised his profession from"
"1943, and was 39 years old when this accident occurred. He has carried out different"
"kinds of operations as a Surgeon, although he has not specialised in any branch. He"
"stated in evidence that it was his intention to retire from Government Service and"
"start a private practice in his home town of Kalutara. As a result of the permanent"
"disability he now suffers from, he will be handicapped and his practice is bound to"
"suffer, because his patients will know about his disability."
"The only question is the quantum of damages that should be awarded…"
"I do not see why the Plaintiff should not be compensated for the loss of his freedom"
"to choose a new way of exercising his profession. He is handicapped to the extent"
"that he cannot do all the work a Surgeon should be able to do. His power to earn is,"
"to this extent, impaired. He is not bound to continue in Government Service: If he had"
"been, of course, the quantum of damages would be almost trivial. He has lost the"
"right, which he formally had, of earning his living in the best way possible.”27"
