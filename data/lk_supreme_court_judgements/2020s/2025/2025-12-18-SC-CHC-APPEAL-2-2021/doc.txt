1. The Factual Background

By Plaint dated 24/08/2016, the Plaintiff–Respondent, Lanka Orix Leasing

Company PLC (hereinafter referred to as the “Plaintiff”), instituted action before

the Commercial High Court of Colombo seeking to recover a sum of Rupees

Twenty-One Million Six Hundred Sixty-Four Thousand Eight Hundred and

Defendant-Appellants

Vs.

Lanka Orix Leasing Company PLC,

100/1, Sri Jayawardenapura Mawatha,

Rajagiriya

Plaintiff-Respondent

Page 4 of 10

Eleven and Cents Ninety-Nine (Rs. 21,664,811.99), together with interest from

01/09/2014, from the 1st to 4th Defendants.

The Plaintiff pleads that at the request of the 1st Defendant, Oslo Marketing (Pvt)

Ltd, a Factoring Agreement (Recourse) dated 12/01/2009 was entered into

between the Plaintiff and the said 1st Defendant. A true copy of the Agreement is

marked “B”. Under the terms of this Agreement, the 1st Defendant agreed to offer

to the Plaintiff all debts owed to it. The Plaintiff was granted full authority to

collect and enforce payment of such debts. It was expressly agreed that the

Plaintiff would have complete recourse to the 1st Defendant for any debts

remaining unpaid by the due date.

The 1st Defendant thereafter commenced operating the facility and, acting under

the Agreement, sold its debts to the Plaintiff. At the request of the 1st Defendant,

the facility was divided into two components, one relating to steel furniture

invoices and the other to sofa invoices. The Plaintiff states that upon accepting

the said invoices, it advanced 80% of the invoice value to the 1st Defendant.

According to the certified Statement of Account, the Plaintiff advanced Rs.

1,192,950.65 under steel invoices and Rs. 20,471,861.34 under sofa invoices.

The Plaintiff has pleaded that since the debtors of the 1st Defendant failed and

neglected to honor the invoices assigned under the factoring facility, the debt was

recourse to the 1st Defendant in accordance with the Agreement. As at

31/08/2014, the total outstanding balance due from the 1st Defendant amounted

to Rs. 21,664,811.99.

The Plaintiff has further averred that by letters of demand dated 17/12/2015, the

Plaintiff demanded payment of the total outstanding sum from the 1st to 4th

Defendants, and that the Defendants failed to respond or make any payment.

In their joint Answer dated 07/04/2017, the Defendants denied the Plaintiff’s

claim. They contended, inter alia, that the Factoring Agreement was signed in

Kurunegala, that it had not been properly completed at the time of signing, that

Page 5 of 10

the Plaintiff failed to notify the Defendants of debtor defaults or take steps to

recover outstanding payments from the debtors, and that the invoices were not

returned back to the Defendant. The Defendants also stated that the interest

charged was excessive and amounted to unjust enrichment.

Upon commencement of trial on 23/01/2018, the Plaintiff raised fourteen issues

and led the evidence of its Assistant Manager (Credit Control), Kapugamage

Saman, and produced documents marked P1 to P12. The 4th Defendant testified

on behalf of all Defendants but did not produce any documents in evidence.

In addition to the admission of the corporate status of the parties, three

admissions were recorded as follows;

1. that signatures were placed on the Factoring Agreement and guarantees by

the defendants.

2. that the 1st Defendant has sold its debts to the Plaintiff, and the Plaintiff

had advanced the money to the 1st Defendant.

3. that 80% of the value of the invoices was advanced to the Defendant by the

Plaintiff.

By Judgment dated 22/05/2020, the learned High Court Judge held that the

Plaintiff had established its claim on a balance of probability and entered

judgment in favor of the Plaintiff for the sum of Rs. 21,664,811.99, with legal

interest from the date of the decree until payment in full.

The Defendants thereafter lodged a Petition of Appeal dated 15/07/2020

challenging the judgment on the basis that the Judge wrongly accepted all

documents marked P1–P12 as proven, without properly considering that several

of them were only marked subject to proof. They further contend that the Plaintiff

failed to produce unpaid invoices and did not return those invoices to the 1st

Defendant as agreed. The Appellants also state that certain clauses in the

Factoring Agreement were unreasonable or against public policy, and that the

Page 6 of 10

Judge failed to recognize that the Plaintiff was attempting to unjustly enrich itself

at their expense.

2. Analysis

At the outset, it is observed that the parties have expressly admitted the execution

of the Factoring Agreement dated 12/01/2009, together with the Guarantee

Bonds signed by the 2nd to 4th Defendants. The admissions in the High Court

proceedings confirm that the Defendants placed their signatures upon the

documents marked “B”, “E”, “F”, and “G”, comprising the Factoring Agreement

and the respective guarantees. The 1st Defendant has further admitted that it sold

its debts to the Plaintiff and accepted 80% of the invoice value as an advance

payment under the terms of the Agreement.

It is also material to note that the Defendants led evidence only of a single

witness, namely the 4th Defendant, who is a director of the Defendant companies

and the husband of the 3rd Defendant. In his oral testimony, the 4th Defendant

clearly admitted that the Defendants had signed the Factoring Agreement and the

corresponding Guarantee Bonds.

The Defendants have taken up a blanket objection that certain provisions of the

Factoring Agreement are contrary to public policy. They have not identified any

impugned clause, nor have they explained in what manner any such clause is said

to offend public policy. In any event, it is common ground that the Defendants,

having had the opportunity to consider the document, chose to sign the

Agreement and the Guarantee Bonds, and assumed the obligations contained in

them.

In Esso Petroleum Company Limited v Harper’s Garage (Stourport)

Limited [1967] 1 All ER 699, Lord Pearce held that,

Page 7 of 10

“It is important that in weighing the question of reasonableness, should give full

weight to commercial practices and to the generality of contracts made freely by

parties bargaining on equal terms.”

And as Lord Wilberforce held in the same case,

“The development of the law does not seem to show, however, that judges have

been able to dispense from the necessity of justification under a public policy test

of reasonableness such contracts or provisions of the contracts as, under

contemporary conditions, may be found to have passed into the accepted and

normal currency of commercial or contractual or conveyancing relations. That

such contracts have done so may be taken to show with at least strong prima

force that, molded under the pressures of negotiation, competition, and public

opinion, they have assumed a form which satisfies the test of public policy as

understood by the courts at the time, or, regarding the matters from the point of

view of the trade, that the trade in question has assumed such a form, that for its

health or expansion it requires a degree of regulation.”

Seen in that light, a party that alleges that a commercial contract is contrary to

public policy must at least identify the specific clause complained of and

demonstrate how its object or effect offends the public interest as recognized by

law. The mere fact that an agreement is commercially advantageous to one party

and disadvantageous to the other does not, by itself, make it unlawful, especially

if the disadvantaged party was free to refuse the bargain and not sign it. Having

examined the Factoring Agreement placed before this Court and bearing in mind

its character as a standard commercial factoring agreement, I am unable to

identify any provision that can properly be described as contrary to public policy

in the sense discussed above.

I also wish to draw attention to the case of Nimalasena vs. L.B. Finance

Company Ltd and others [C.A. Case No. 831/2000 (F) decided on

06/02/2017], where A. H. M. D. Nawaz J. has held as follows:

Page 8 of 10

“I also find that the 2nd defendant appellant was a technician and a tradesman

on his own admission. The witness came through as a man of the world who

could not have been so naive as to be unaware of the implications of placing

one's signature to a guarantee. If he knew that the act of signing a guarantee

would spell for him disastrous consequences of monetary burdens, he should

have exhibited prudence. So, his assertion that he only signed as a witness and

not as a guarantor does not inspire confidence in this Court.”

Accordingly, the Defendants in the present case, who are corporate entities and

directors and who have admittedly signed the Factoring Agreement and the

Guarantee Bonds and benefited from the advances made under them, cannot

avoid the legal consequences of those documents by resorting to an undefined

and unsupported allegation of public policy or by suggesting that they did not

appreciate what they were signing.

The defendants have not taken any plea that the signatures were procured by

fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake. Therefore, the Agreement stands validly

executed and binding upon the parties.

The Defendants contend that the Plaintiff failed to produce the unpaid invoices

and did not return those invoices to the 1st Defendant as required. However, a

perusal of the agreement in question indicates that under the terms of recourse,

no clause obligates the Plaintiff to return unpaid invoices to the Client merely

because the relevant debts have not been collected. Therefore, I see no merit in

the said argument.

The Defendants have also raised an issue of unjust enrichment, alleging that the

Plaintiff is attempting to unjustly enrich itself by instituting this action. In

Premier Marketing Ltd v Seylan Bank PLC [SC (CHC) 05/2009, decided on

22/03/2019] Dehideniya J. cites Banque Financiere de la Cite v. Parc

(Battersea) Ltd [(1999) AC 221, 227, HL] with approval, as follows:

Page 9 of 10

“…Lord Steyn held that a Plaintiff must show three things to make a claim under

the ground of unjust enrichment.

1) The Defendant has been enriched.

2) The enrichment has been gained at the Plaintiff’s expense.

3) The circumstances of the enrichment are such that, it would be unjust to

let the Defendant keep the benefit.”

Accordingly, to prove unjust enrichment, the Defendant first needs to establish

that the Plaintiff has been enriched at the expense of the Defendant. The claim of

the Plaintiff in this case is based on a written and admitted Factoring Agreement

and Guarantee Bonds, which the Defendants freely executed. Under the terms of

that Agreement, the Plaintiff advanced funds to the 1st Defendant amounting to

80% of the invoice value, and the Defendants expressly undertook to repay any

sums that remained unpaid by the debtors. The Plaintiff’s entitlement to recover

those sums arises directly from the contractual provisions.

According to the documentary evidence placed before this Court, there is no

indication that any debtor of the 1st Defendant made payments to the Plaintiff.

The Plaintiff’s witness has categorically stated that the customers of the 1st

Defendant failed and neglected to honor the invoices under the factoring facility,

and this evidence has not been contradicted. The Defendants, for their part, have

produced no documentary or oral evidence to demonstrate that any debtor made

any payment, nor have they provided any material suggesting that the Plaintiff

recovered monies from any source other than recourse to the 1st Defendant under

the terms of the Agreement. In these circumstances, the complaint of unjust

enrichment is entirely unfounded. The Defendants have failed to explain how, in

the absence of debtor payments, the Plaintiff is said to have been enriched, let

alone unjustly enriched, by instituting this action.

In all the above circumstances, I answer questions of law raised by the

Defendant-Appellant in the negative and affirm the Judgement of the

Commercial High Court dated 22/05/2020.
