"After having considered the evidence before the trial Court and coming to a"
"clear determination as to the pivotal issue that should have been considered"
"by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  I  find  that  this  was  an  instance"
"where  a  positive  appellate  judgment  could  have  been  pronounced  by  the"
"learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in"
"Kandy, and thereby, bringing this protracted litigation to an end."
"I am of the view that this should be the purpose of every appellate judgment,"
"unless it is a situation where there is no option before the Court, but to order"
"a re-trial."
"For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the appeal preferred"
"by the substituted plaintiff-appellant, in order to challenge only the relevant"
"part of the determination made by the learned Judges of the High Court where"
"a de novo trial was ordered, should succeed."
"Accordingly, I answer the considered questions of law in the following manner."
