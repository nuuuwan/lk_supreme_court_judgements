"The said questions of law read as follows:"
"1.  Whether it is correct for the learned High Court Judge to order a trial"
"de novo when the appellate Court has held that the trial Judge was"
"wrong in holding that it is not the 1968 annual value that should be"
"applicable, but 1986 valuation â€“ which was the pivotal issue raised"
"before the trial Judge, where the trial Judge has held that it is the"
"1968 annual value that is applicable."
"2.  Whether such decision to order a trial de novo is warranted in the"
"given situation."
