"Held:"
"1.  For the purpose of the existence of a new premises it is essential that"
"some kind of physical alteration to the premises was carried out. In"
"a  situation  where  there  is  a  physical  alteration  to  a  premises  the"
"extent  and  significance  of  that  physical  alteration  would  certainly"
"have to be taken into consideration."
"2.  The  premises  are  business  premises.  The  first  time  the  premises"
"were assessed as one unit as business premises after January, 1968,"
"was in 1970. There is no evidence of substantial physical alteration"
"to the building thereafter; in these circumstances, it cannot be said"
"that  a  new  premises  has  come  into  existence  and  therefore,  the"
"assessment in 1970 will continue to govern the premises."
