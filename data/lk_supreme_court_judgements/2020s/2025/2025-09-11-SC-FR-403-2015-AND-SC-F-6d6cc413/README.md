Attorney General.

Argued on: 09/07/2025

Decided on: 11/09/2025

A. L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

1. When SC/FR/403/2015 and SC/FR/404/2015 were taken up for Argument,

the respective parties agreed that a single Judgment be delivered in both

matters. Accordingly, SC/FR/403/2015 was taken up for consideration. At

the commencement of proceedings, learned Presidents Counsel for the 3rd

Respondent, Mr. Saliya Pieris, raised a Preliminary Objection against the

maintainability of the Petition on the ground of prescription.

2. By the Amended Petition and Affidavit dated 11/12/2015 in

SC/FR/403/2015, the Petitioner previously attached to the Sri Lanka Air

Force, invokes the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126 of the

Constitution, alleging violations of his Fundamental Rights arising from acts

of physical assault, unlawful detention, procedural injustice, and

harassment at the hands of superior officers. The Petitioner seeks redress for

the infringement of his rights guaranteed under Articles 11, 12(1), 12(2), and

14(1)(g), and calls upon this Court to examine the legality, proportionality,

P a g e 5 | 10

and bona fides of the Respondents actions within the framework of

constitutional justice.

3. The Petitioner avers that the alleged infringement of his Fundamental Rights

by the 3rd Respondent occurred on or about the 10/09/2015. However, the

initial Fundamental Rights application was filed before this Court only on

the 30/10/2015, which is beyond the one-month period prescribed under

Article 126(2) of the Constitution. The said Petition or the subsequent

Amended Petition dated 11/12/2015 does not provide any justification for

the lapse in time.

4. It is a well-established principle of Constitutional Law that an application

under Article 126(2) must be instituted within one month of the alleged

infringement of a Fundamental Right. This requirement is not merely

procedural but jurisdictional in nature.

5. Article 126(2) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka reads as follows;

126. (2) Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or

language right relating to such person has been infringed or is about to

be infringed by executive or administrative action, he may himself or by

an Attorney-at-Law on his behalf, within one month thereof, in

accordance with such rules of court as may be in force, apply to the

Supreme Court by way of petition in writing addressed to such Court

praying for relief or redress in respect of such infringement. Such

application may be proceeded with only with leave to proceed first had

and obtained from the Supreme Court, which leave may be granted or

refused, as the case may be, by not less than two judges.

6. The Petitioner seeks to rely on a complaint purportedly lodged with the

Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) on 01/10/2015, marked

P9, in order to invoke Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act of

Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 and thereby exclude such period from the

P a g e 6 | 10

computation of time. However, the said receipt does not disclose the nature

or content of the complaint, nor a copy of the complaint is filed of record.

More significantly, there is no material before this Court to indicate that any

inquiry was pending before the HRCSL.

7. Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act stipulates that where a

complaint is made to the Commission within one month of the alleged

infringement, the period during which an inquiry is pending shall be

excluded from the computation of time under Article 126(2) of the

Constitution.

8. Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of

1996 reads as follows;

13. (1) Where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms of

section 14, to the Commission, within one month of the alleged

infringement or imminent infringement of a fundamental right by

executive or administrative action, the period within which the inquiry

into such complaint is pending before the Commission, shall not be taken

into account in computing the period of one month within which an

application may be made to the Supreme Court by such person in terms

of Article 126 (2) of the Constitution.

9. However, the benefit of this provision is contingent upon the existence of a

valid and pending inquiry. A mere assertion that a complaint was made,

unsupported by any evidence of its contents or progress, is insufficient to

invoke the statutory exception.

10. In the case of Subasinghe vs. Inspector General of Police1, His Lordship

S. N. Silva CJ had held that;

"The Petitioner seeks to bring the complaint within the time limit on the

basis that he made the complaint to the Human Rights Commission of

1 Subasinghe v. Inspector General of Police SC Sp. 16/99 SCM 11.9.2000

P a g e 7 | 10

Sri Lanka within the stipulated time. In this regard the petitioner relies

on section 13 and 14 of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act

No. 21 of 1996 which provides that where a complaint has been made

within a period of one month to the Human Rights Commission, the

period within which the inquiry into such complaint was pending before

the Commission will not be taken into account in computing the period

within which an application should be filled in this Court.

The Petitioner has failed to adduce any evidence that there has been an

inquiry pending before Human Rights Commission. In the

circumstances, we have to uphold the preliminary objection raised by

learned State Counsel.

11. The aforementioned case was referred to by His Lordship Justice Gamini

Amaratunga, in the case of Ranaweera & Others vs. Sub Inspector

Wilson Siriwardena & Others2, where His Lordship held that;

It is very clear from the section quoted above that the mere act of

making a complaint to the Human Rights Commission is not sufficient

to suspend the running of time relating to the time limit of one month

prescribed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution. In terms of the said

section 13(1), the period of time to be excluded in computing the period

of one month prescribed by Article 126(2) of the Constitution is "the

period within which the inquiry into such complaint is pending before

the Commission."

Section 14 of the Human Rights Commission Act (in so far as it is

relevant to the present purpose) reads as follows. "The Commission

may... on a complaint made to it by an aggrieved person investigate an

allegation of an infringement or imminent infringement of a

fundamental right of any person "

2 Ranaweera & Others V. Sub Inspector Wilson Siriwardena & Others [2008]1 SLR 260

P a g e 8 | 10

Thus the Human Rights Commission is not legally obliged to hold an

investigation into every complaint received by it regarding the alleged

violation of a fundamental right. Therefore, a party seeking to utilize

section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission Act to contend that "the

period within which the inquiry into such complaint is pending before

the Commission shall not be taken into account in computing the period

of one month within which an application may be made to the Supreme

Court" is obliged to place material before this Court to show that an

inquiry into his complaint is pending before the Human Rights

Commission.

12. In Thilangani Kandambi vs. State Timber Corporation & Others3, this

Court identified four key principles on the application of Section 13(1) of the

Act concerning Article 126(2) of the Constitution. They are as follows:

a. The initial view was that mere production of a complaint made to

the HRCSL within one month of the alleged infringement is

sufficient to get the benefit of the provisions in section 13(1) of the

HRCSL Act [Romesh Coorey v Jayalath (2008) 2 Sri.L.R. 43, Alles

v. Road Passenger Services Authority of the Western Province,

(S.C.F.R. 448/2009, S.C.M. 22.02.2013)].

b. However, the present position is that a petitioner must show

evidence that the HRCSL has conducted an inquiry regarding the

complaint or that an inquiry is pending. Simply lodging a

complaint is inadequate. [Subasinghe v. Inspector General of

Police, SC (Spl) 16/1999, S.C.M. 11.09.2000; Kariyawasam v.

Southern Provincial Road Development Authority and 8 Others,

(2007) 2 Sri.L.R. 33; Ranaweera and Others v. Sub-Inspector

Wilson Siriwardene and Others (2008) 1 Sri.L.R. 260; K.H.G.

Kithsiri v Faizer Musthapha, (S.C.F.R. 362/2017, S.C.M.

3 Thilangani Kandambi v. State Timber Corporation & Others (S.C.F.R. Application No: 452/2019; S.C.M. 14.12.2022, page 9)

P a g e 9 | 10

10.01.2018); Wanasinghe v. Kamal Paliskara and Others, (S.C.F.R.

216/2014, S.C.M. 23.06.2021)].

c. A party cannot benefit from the provisions in section 13(1) of the

HRCSL Act where the complaint to the HRCSL is made one month

after the alleged violation [Alagaratnam Manoranjan v. G.A.

Chandrasiri, Governor, Northern Province, (S.C.F.R. 261/2013,

S.C.M. 11.09.2014)].

d. The provisions of section 13(1) of the HRCSL are not available to a

petitioner who has made a complaint to the HRCSL only to obtain

an advantage by bringing his application within Article 126(2) of

the Constitution [K.H.G. Kithsiri v Faizer Musthapha, (S.C.F.R.

362/2017, SCM 10.01.2018)].

13. This Court finds that, when the Petitioner filed the initial application dated

30/10/2015, he was fully aware that the jurisdictional requirement under

Article 126(2) of the Constitution had already been breached. By producing

P9, the Petitioner sought to rely on the statutory exclusion from the

computation of time under Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission

Act, thereby placing the Respondents on notice of such reliance. This

obviates the need for the Respondents to have raised a specific objection in

that regard.

14. Nevertheless, the Petitioner has failed to establish that an inquiry was in fact

pending before the Human Rights Commission. No documentation has been

produced, and neither the original Petition nor the Amended Petition

provides any clarification in this regard. Accordingly, this Court holds that

the Petitioner cannot invoke the protection afforded by Section 13(1) of the

Act. The burden of proving the applicability of the statutory exception lies

squarely with the Petitioner, and that burden has not been discharged.

15. The legal maxim vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt, which

means; the law assists those who are vigilant, not those who sleep on their

rights, applies with full force in this instance. In effect, the law supports

P a g e 10 | 10

individuals who are proactive in protecting their rights and interests, and it

will not assist those who are negligent or fail to act within reasonable

timeframes.

16. The Petitioner, having been aware of the alleged infringement, chose not to

invoke the jurisdiction of this Court within the prescribed time. No material

has been placed before this Court to suggest that the Petitioner was

prevented from doing so due to circumstances beyond his control, and the

delay is unexplained.

CONCLUSION

17. The Petitioner failed to satisfy the threshold requirement under Article

126(2) of the Constitution, and the statutory exception under Section 13(1)

of the Human Rights Commission Act was applicable. The application is

time-barred and procedurally untenable. The Preliminary Objection is

accordingly upheld, and the application numbers SC/FR/403/2015 and

SC/FR/404/2015 are dismissed in limine.
