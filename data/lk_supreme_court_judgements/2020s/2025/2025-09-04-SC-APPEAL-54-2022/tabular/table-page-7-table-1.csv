"“What I  have stated above shall not be taken to mean that all documents the"
"opposing party purportedly requires to be marked subject to proof must necessarily"
"be proved by calling witnesses. There is a practice among some lawyers to get up"
"and say ‘subject to proof’ whenever a document is marked in evidence by the other"
"party. This they do as a matter of course or as a matter of routine and not with any"
"particular objective in mind, except perhaps to prolong the trial. It is regrettable"
"that most of the time the party who produces the document obliges to this without a"
"murmur.   If   we   are   serious   about   laws   delays,   we   must   put   an   end   to   this   bad"
"practice. When a counsel routinely says ‘subject to proof’, the Judge must ask what"
"he wants the other party to prove in the document. If this simple question is asked, I"
"am certain the objection would be withdrawn or at least the issue to be addressed"
"would be narrowed down. On the other hand, if the document is, take for instance, a"
"Deed pleaded in the plaint but no issue has been raised disputing the Deed, the"
"Defendant cannot make a routine application to mark it subject to proof when it is"
"marked in evidence. Against this backdrop, I must emphasize that the Judge shall"
"not mechanically refuse documents marked subject to proof but not technically"
"proved by calling witnesses. The Judge shall decide the question of proof at the"
"end   of   the   trial   on   the   facts   and   circumstances   of   each   individual   case.”"
