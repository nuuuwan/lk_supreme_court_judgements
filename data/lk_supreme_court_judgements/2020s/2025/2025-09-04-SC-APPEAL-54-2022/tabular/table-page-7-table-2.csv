"This rule is applicable vice versa. Even a document is marked without objection, the"
"duty of court remains to examine its probative value and if it cannot be relied upon court"

"Arachchige Ranjanie Jayasinghe and others10 states,"
"“If the statement is relevant and admissible, then the court has no discretion, but to"
"admit it. The court, however, is at liberty to consider the probative value of the contents"
"upon evaluation and decide either to act on them or to reject it.”"
