"Justice   Janak   de   Silva   in  Multiform   Chemicals   Limited   vs   Adrian   Machado11"
"distinguishes admissibility of evidence from the evidential value given to a piece of"
"evidence as follows;"
"“Probative value of evidence means the weight to be attached to the evidence tendered"
"and is different from admissibility of evidence. It is a question of fact that cannot be"
"regulated by a set of precise rules.”"
