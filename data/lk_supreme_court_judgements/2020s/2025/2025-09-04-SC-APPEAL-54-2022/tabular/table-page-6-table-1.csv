"at Imbulgoda, noting that they traveled to Imbulgoda, located between Colombo and"
"Gampaha, passing through Ja-Ela."
"According to the Defendant, on that unfortunate day, he was taken to the Ayurvedic"
"Physician   by   a   person   named   'Christy'.   However,   according   to   the   witness,  Michel"
"Fernando,   who   testified   on   behalf   of   the   Defendant,   it   was   he   who   had   taken   the"
"Defendant to the Ayurvedic Physician."
"According   to   the  Ayurvedic   medical   certificate   (‘P1’),   the   diagnosis   given   by   the"
"Ayurvedic Physician is ‘කඨීශූල’. However, the Ayurvedic Physician was not called to"
"give evidence regarding this diagnosis. Consequently, the District Judge was unable to"
"assess the seriousness of the injury or the qualifications of the Ayurvedic Physician to"
"make such a diagnosis.  The medical certificate (‘P1’) was marked subject to proof.5"
"However, at the closure of the Defendant’s case, no objection was raised by the Plaintiff."
"As held by Samarakoon C.J. in Sri Lanka Ports Authority v. Jugolinija-Boal East6 and"
"followed in many subsequent judicial decisions,7 if no objection is taken at the closure"
"of a case, documents read in evidence become evidence for all purposes of the law. 8 The"
"fact that the medical certificate was marked subject to proof but not objected to at the"
"closure of the Defendant’s case should not, by itself, prevent the Court from considering"
"its contents. The evidential value of the document is ultimately a matter for the Court to"
"determine."
"In  Sirinivasam Prasanth & another v. Nadarajah Deverajan9  this court rightly held"
"that, mere fact that a document was objected to at its production does not compel court"
"to mechanically reject the same. Justice Mahinda Samayawardena has observed,"
