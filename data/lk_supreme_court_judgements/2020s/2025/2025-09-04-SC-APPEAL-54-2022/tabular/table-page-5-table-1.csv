"At the inquiry, the Defendant testified that he fell from a tree in October 2011. However,"
"he immediately changed the date to December 23, 2011. During cross-examination, the"
"Defendant further altered the date to December 29, 2011, also stating that it could have"
"been either the 28th or 29th, showing uncertainty."
"According to the Defendant, the injury sustained from falling from the tree was to his"
"spine, causing him to be confined to bed for fifteen days and unable to engage in his"
"usual activities for several months."
"In these circumstances, I am of the view that it is highly improbable that the Defendant"
"does not remember the exact date of such a significant and unfortunate incident."
"The  Defendant’s own daughter testified that  the incident occurred on December 29,"
"2011. However, another witness, Michel Fernando, who accompanied the Defendant to"
"the Ayurvedic physician, was unable to state the exact date but estimated it could have"
"been  either the 27th, 28th, or 29th  of December, somewhere between Christmas and the"
"New Year4."
"It is  important to observe that even the Ayurvedic medical certificate (‘P1’) does not"
"specify the date of the fall from the tree either. Furthermore, although the Defendant and"
"the witnesses stated that the Defendant was unable to engage in his daily activities for"
"several months, the Ayurvedic Physician recommended leave for only five days. This"
"discrepancy raises serious doubts as to the credibility of the witnesses concerning the"
"injury allegedly sustained by the Defendant."
"According to the Defendant, the Ayurvedic Physician who treated him was from Ja-Ela."
"However, the Ayurvedic medical certificate (‘P1’) produced to the court was issued by"
"an Ayurvedic Physician from Imbulgoda. The Defendant’s daughter also testified that"
"her father was treated by an Ayurvedic Physician from the Ja-Ela area. In contrast, the"
"witness Michel Fernando stated that the Defendant was taken to an Ayurvedic Physician"
