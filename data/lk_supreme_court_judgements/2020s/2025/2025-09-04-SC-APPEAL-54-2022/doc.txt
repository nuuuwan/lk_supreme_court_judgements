This appeal stems from the judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal,

Negombo, dated July 7, 2021, wherein the learned Judges of the High Court upheld the

decision of the learned District Judge of Negombo delivered on January 1, 2019.

Following the filing of an application seeking leave to appeal before this Court, and after

considering the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the DefendantAppellant

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant) and the learned Counsel for the

PlaintiffRespondentRespondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff), this Court

granted leave to appeal on the questions of law set out in paragraphs 13(a) and 13(e) of

the Petition dated August 04, 2021, which reads as follows:

(a) Did the learned High Court Judges gravely err in holding that, falling from a Jak

tree and injury on the spine is not a reasonable ground to purge default under section 86

(2) of Civil Procedure Code;

(e) Did the learned High Court Judges gravely err in holding that, all oral evidence is

insufficient to prove purge default of the Defendant Petitioner in the absence of evidence

of the Ayurvedic Doctor;

Accordingly, this Court fixed the matter for argument, at which stage the learned

Counsel for the Defendant and the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff made comprehensive

submissions.

The Plaintiff instituted the instant action in the District Court of Negombo, inter alia,

seeking, a decree for the cancellation of Deed No. 27246 dated October 02, 2010,

attested by Deshabandu Wickremasingha, Notary Public; the ejectment of the Defendant 3

and all others claiming under him from the land described in the schedule to the Plaint;

and damages as prayed for in the Plaint.

Upon accepting the Plaint, the District Court issued summons to the Defendant, and the

Fiscal reported that summons had been duly served on the Defendant. However, on

January 02, 2012, the returnable date, the Defendant failed to appear, and accordingly,

the case was fixed for ex-parte trial in terms of Section 85 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Subsequently, the case was taken up for ex-parte trial on March 15, 2012, and the

Plaintiff gave evidence in support of his case. The matter was then fixed for judgment,

and on August 21, 2012, the learned District Judge delivered the judgment granting the

reliefs () and () prayed for in the plaint, including ejectment of the Defendant and

costs.

Consequently, the learned District Judge directed that the ex-parte decree be served on

the Defendant, and the Fiscal reported that it had been served on the Defendant on

November 08, 2012. Thereafter, on November 21, 2012, the Defendant filed a proxy

together with a Petition supported by an Affidavit, seeking to purge his default1.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff moved to file objections to the application and the objections

were accordingly filed2.

Thereafter, the learned District Judge fixed the matter for Inquiry. It is important to note

that [a]n inquiry on an application to set aside an exparte decree is not regulated by

any specific provision in the Civil Procedure Code. Such inquiries must be conducted

consistently with the principles of natural justice and requirements of fairness. Section

839 of the Civil Procedure Code recognizes the inherent power of the court to make an

order as may be necessary to meet the ends of justice. 3

1Vide J.E.No. 9 dated November 22, 2012.2Vide J.E. No.11 dated January 28, 2013.3 De Fonseka vs Dharmawardene [1994] 3 Sri LR 49. 4

At the inquiry, the Defendant testified that he fell from a tree in October 2011. However,

he immediately changed the date to December 23, 2011. During cross-examination, the

Defendant further altered the date to December 29, 2011, also stating that it could have

been either the 28th or 29th, showing uncertainty.

According to the Defendant, the injury sustained from falling from the tree was to his

spine, causing him to be confined to bed for fifteen days and unable to engage in his

usual activities for several months.

In these circumstances, I am of the view that it is highly improbable that the Defendant

does not remember the exact date of such a significant and unfortunate incident.

The Defendants own daughter testified that the incident occurred on December 29,

2011. However, another witness, Michel Fernando, who accompanied the Defendant to

the Ayurvedic physician, was unable to state the exact date but estimated it could have

been either the 27th, 28th, or 29th of December, somewhere between Christmas and the

New Year4.

It is important to observe that even the Ayurvedic medical certificate (P1) does not

specify the date of the fall from the tree either. Furthermore, although the Defendant and

the witnesses stated that the Defendant was unable to engage in his daily activities for

several months, the Ayurvedic Physician recommended leave for only five days. This

discrepancy raises serious doubts as to the credibility of the witnesses concerning the

injury allegedly sustained by the Defendant.

According to the Defendant, the Ayurvedic Physician who treated him was from Ja-Ela.

However, the Ayurvedic medical certificate (P1) produced to the court was issued by

an Ayurvedic Physician from Imbulgoda. The Defendants daughter also testified that

her father was treated by an Ayurvedic Physician from the Ja-Ela area. In contrast, the

witness Michel Fernando stated that the Defendant was taken to an Ayurvedic Physician

4At pp. 225 and 226 of the Appeal brief. 5

at Imbulgoda, noting that they traveled to Imbulgoda, located between Colombo and

Gampaha, passing through Ja-Ela.

According to the Defendant, on that unfortunate day, he was taken to the Ayurvedic

Physician by a person named 'Christy'. However, according to the witness, Michel

Fernando, who testified on behalf of the Defendant, it was he who had taken the

Defendant to the Ayurvedic Physician.

According to the Ayurvedic medical certificate (P1), the diagnosis given by the

Ayurvedic Physician is . However, the Ayurvedic Physician was not called to

give evidence regarding this diagnosis. Consequently, the District Judge was unable to

assess the seriousness of the injury or the qualifications of the Ayurvedic Physician to

make such a diagnosis. The medical certificate (P1) was marked subject to proof.5

However, at the closure of the Defendants case, no objection was raised by the Plaintiff.

As held by Samarakoon C.J. in Sri Lanka Ports Authority v. Jugolinija-Boal East6 and

followed in many subsequent judicial decisions,7 if no objection is taken at the closure

of a case, documents read in evidence become evidence for all purposes of the law.8 The

fact that the medical certificate was marked subject to proof but not objected to at the

closure of the Defendants case should not, by itself, prevent the Court from considering

its contents. The evidential value of the document is ultimately a matter for the Court to

determine.

In Sirinivasam Prasanth & another v. Nadarajah Deverajan9 this court rightly held

that, mere fact that a document was objected to at its production does not compel court

to mechanically reject the same. Justice Mahinda Samayawardena has observed,

5Vide proceedings dated March 25, 2015.6[1981]1 Sri. L.R. 18.7 See Balapitiya Gunananda Thero v. Talalle Meththananda Thero (1997) 2 Sri L.R 101 and Dadallage Anil Shantha Samarasinghe v. Dadallage Mervin Silva SC Appeal 45/2010 S/C Minute dated 11.6.2019.8 See also Cinemas Limited V Sounderarajan (1998) 2 Sri L.R. 16, Adaicappa Chetty v. Thos.Cook and Son 31 N L R 385, Silva v. Kindersley 18 N L R 85.9S.C. Appeal No. 163/2019, S.C. Minutes dated 22.03.2021 at pp 14 and 15. 6

What I have stated above shall not be taken to mean that all documents the

opposing party purportedly requires to be marked subject to proof must necessarily

be proved by calling witnesses. There is a practice among some lawyers to get up

and say subject to proof whenever a document is marked in evidence by the other

party. This they do as a matter of course or as a matter of routine and not with any

particular objective in mind, except perhaps to prolong the trial. It is regrettable

that most of the time the party who produces the document obliges to this without a

murmur. If we are serious about laws delays, we must put an end to this bad

practice. When a counsel routinely says subject to proof, the Judge must ask what

he wants the other party to prove in the document. If this simple question is asked, I

am certain the objection would be withdrawn or at least the issue to be addressed

would be narrowed down. On the other hand, if the document is, take for instance, a

Deed pleaded in the plaint but no issue has been raised disputing the Deed, the

Defendant cannot make a routine application to mark it subject to proof when it is

marked in evidence. Against this backdrop, I must emphasize that the Judge shall

not mechanically refuse documents marked subject to proof but not technically

proved by calling witnesses. The Judge shall decide the question of proof at the

end of the trial on the facts and circumstances of each individual case.

[emphasis added]

This rule is applicable vice versa. Even a document is marked without objection, the

duty of court remains to examine its probative value and if it cannot be relied upon court

should refuse to rely on it.

Therefore, Justice Aluwihare in the case of Koswatte Gamage Jayanatha vs Jayasinghe

Arachchige Ranjanie Jayasinghe and others10 states,

If the statement is relevant and admissible, then the court has no discretion, but to

admit it. The court, however, is at liberty to consider the probative value of the contents

upon evaluation and decide either to act on them or to reject it.

10 SC/Appeal/146/12, SC Minutes of 17-02-2016 7

Justice Janak de Silva in Multiform Chemicals Limited vs Adrian Machado11

distinguishes admissibility of evidence from the evidential value given to a piece of

evidence as follows;

Probative value of evidence means the weight to be attached to the evidence tendered

and is different from admissibility of evidence. It is a question of fact that cannot be

regulated by a set of precise rules.

The first application to vacate the ex-parte decree was made only on November 22,

2012. No application was made to Court to set aside the ex-parte decree until it was

served on the Defendant. This Court is mindful that, even if such an application had

been made prior to the service of the ex-parte decree on the Defendant, the decree could

have been vacated only with the consent of the Plaintiff12.

The Defendants evidence was that he received summons in advance requiring him to

appear in Court on January 2, 2012. However, due to the unfortunate incident that

occurred, he was unable to be present in Court. In the circumstances, this Court is of the

view that if this situation had been brought to its notice before the ex-parte decree was

served, although such an application could not have been considered at that stage, it

would nevertheless have supported the bona fides of the Defendant.

Samayawardhena, J. in the case of Nirmala Anura Fernando vs Sri Lanka Savings

Bank Limited and Others13 citing the dicta of Justice Weerasuriya in Coomaraswamy v.

Mariamma14 observed that the requirement for the party to make an application within

14 days of the service of the decree does not preclude the defendant to make an

application before service of the decree and for the Court to inquire into such

application after decree was served.

11 Multiform Chemicals Limited vs Adrian Machado (S.C. Appeal No. 183/2011, SC Minutes of 18.07.2024).

12 Section 86 (2A) of the Civil Procedure Code.13 SC/CHC/APPEAL/81/2014, SC Minutes of 28.02.2024.14 [2001] 3 Sri LR 312 at 315. 8

In light of the above analysis, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judges

rightly affirmed the decision of the learned District Judge refusing to set aside the ex-

parte decree entered against the Defendant.

Consequently, I answer both questions of law in the negative.

The Plaintiff is entitled to the costs of this Court as well as those of both lower courts.
