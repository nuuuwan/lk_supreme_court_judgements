"320 it was held that,"
"“ Where there is a contest as regards the title to a land if the claim"
"of the parties is brought before a Court for its decision and there is"
"an assumption that meanwhile the party occupying shall remain in"
"possession, the running of the statute in favour of the defendant is"
"suspended ; otherwise a bar will all the while be running which the"
"plaintiff could by no means avert. If the plaintiff fails in his action"
"there  has  been  no  break  in  the  continuity  of  possession  of  the"
"defendant. If the plaintiff succeeds the continuity of possession of"
"the one who was keeping the rightful owner out of his possession"
"is broken; the result of the finding of the Court is to restore the seisin"
"of the plaintiff.’’"
