Based on the evidence submitted, [page 110 of the brief] it is evident that the 2nd respondent, in his statement, has conceded that his mother- in law did not hold any title to the property in question. The 2nd respondent asserts that the property was transferred to him and his wife as a wedding gift by his mother-in-law in 1988, the year of their marriage. However, it is noteworthy that the property was allegedly transferred to the mother in 1989.11.06, as per Deed No. 628.
