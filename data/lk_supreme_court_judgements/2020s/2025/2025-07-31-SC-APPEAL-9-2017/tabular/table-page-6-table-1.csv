"“Once paper title became undisputed the burden shifted to the"
"defendants to show that they had independent rights in the form of"
"prescription as claimed by them.”."
"This principle was previously followed by Gratiaen, J. in the case of R. W."
"Pathirana vs. R. E. De S. Jayasundara 58 NLR (159 – 177)."
"But if that is so, the defendant-respondent has to prove before the trial"
"court that she had undisturbed possession of the property."
"It is a well-accepted principle of law that to establish title on prescription to"
"an immovable property, the claimant must establish an exclusive adverse"
"possession against all other owners."
"The above principle of law has been written down under section 3 of the"
"Prescription Ordinance, which has stipulated that the claimant must prove"
"on a balance of probability that he or she had undisturbed and"
"uninterrupted possession for a minimum period of ten years."
"In the case of Alwis vs Perera 21 NLR 321, it has been held that, when"
"witnesses claim they have possession, the Court must insist on those words"
"being reasonably explained and not by mere statements."
"In the instant matter, the defendant-respondent had stated in evidence that"
"she had come in to the property because of her first husband in 1978 and"
"the first husband had been the servant of another party. Thereafter, after"
"his demise, the defendant-appellant had remarried and he had occupied the"
"property as a licensee of a monk."
"Hence, the defendant cannot prove as to an exact date on which she had"
"come to the possession and moreover even the two husbands of hers has"
"had no possession or dominium over the property but had been the agent or"
"the licensee of another."
"Thereafter, she had proceeded to apply to the state, asking for a permit to"
"occupy the land but this is not state land. Hence, if she believed that she"
"had possession of the land and claimed prescriptive title, how can she apply"
"for a permit from the state because that is admitting state title to the land in"
"suit, which is contrary to her earlier position (page 94 and 93 and the"
"document is P10)."
"At page 121 of the brief, she had said in cross-examination that no one"
"handed her any possession of any land. Her evidence with regard to P14,"
"which is a police complaint, very clearly states that her 1st husband was the"
"licensee of a Japanese monk but she refuses to admit that it was the"
"plaintiff-respondent."
