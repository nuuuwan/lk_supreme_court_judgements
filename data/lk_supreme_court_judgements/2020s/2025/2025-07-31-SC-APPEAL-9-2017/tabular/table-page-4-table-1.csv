"The caretaker of the plaintiff had given evidence and he has contradicted the"
"plaintiff by stating that the defendant-appellant had been in possession only"
"after the plaintiff-respondent had purchased the property, but the official"
"from the Urban development authority had stated that in the year 1999, the"
"defendant-respondent had informed of her possession of the property and"
"had applied for a permit."
"The defendant-appellant in evidence had said that she had been in"
"possession since 1978.04.06. She also has produced a certificate by the"
"Grama Niladhari, who had said that she had been in possession of the"
"property for 31 years and the said certificate had been marked as V10."
"The Grama Niladhari had substantiated her position."
"The Trial Judge had held that the title of the plaintiff-respondent has been"
"established, although the deeds marked had not been produced in Court, as"
"the defendant-appellant has not challenged the same. But he has held that"
"although the plaintiff has established the paper title, he has not established"
"sufficiently that he had the possession of the property and that the"
"defendant-appellant had established that she has had the possession of the"
"property, as such, he has awarded the prescriptive title to the defendant-"
"appellant of the land in suit."
"Being aggrieved by the said finding, the plaintiff-respondent had lodged an"
"appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court and the said Court has held that"
"the trial judge had erred in law because if he has concluded that the"
"plaintiff-respondent had paper title, as per that, he need not prove his prior"
"possession and ouster and such the burden shifts to the defendant-"
"appellant to show that she had independent rights in the form of"
"prescription, as claimed by her."
"The reasons set out by the learned judges of the Civil Appellate High Court"
"is that the defendant-appellant has come in to the land after her marriage to"
"the first husband in 1978. But according to her evidence the said husband"
"had been on leave and license of the said land from one Kavidasa Mudalali."
"Thereafter, her first husband had passed away in 1988 and she had then"
"married one Jayasinghe on 10.08.1989, whom she had at one point said"
"was a licensee of a monk."
"It had also been considered that at one point, according to the evidence of"
"the defendant-appellant, that she had applied for a license from the state"
"(page 12)."
"Hence, the Civil Appellate High Court has concluded that the defendant had"
"not been able to prove a starting point of her adverse possession of the land"
