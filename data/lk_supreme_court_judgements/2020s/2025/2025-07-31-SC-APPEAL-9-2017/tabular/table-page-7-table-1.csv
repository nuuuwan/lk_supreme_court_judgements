"The plaintiff-respondent also, had marked P16 which is a deed of"
"declaration by the no. 1838 dated 03.10.2003 drawn by the defendant"
"appellant in which she admits that the land in possession was obtained"
"from the original owner."
"Her evidence is very well calculated and she appears to be mindful of her"
"claim but I suppose her lack of literacy skills have made her contradict her"
"own evidence at times."
"Hence, upon reading of the evidence led at the trial and considering the"
"written submissions filed by the parties, I find that the defendant-appellant"
"has taken various positions with regard to her possession of the property."
"Her evidence with regard to her possession of the land in suit is ambiguous"
"and contrary and fails to establish her uninterrupted adverse possession of"
"the land in suit against the plaintiff-respondent."
"As such, while answering all the questions of law in the negative, I see no"
"reason to set aside the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court and the"
"instant appeal is dismissed and the judgment and the reliefs granted by the"
"Civil Appellate High Court is hereby affirmed and no order is made with"
"regard to costs."
