"the party prescribing is, in such a case, demonstrably referable to  an adverse title."
"However, if the occupier, at the commencement of his occupation, acknowledges the"
"owner’s title, he is presumed to continue occupation in the identical capacity. In such"
"a situation of this kind, possession adverse to the owner begins only when the basis"
"of occupation has been changed by an “overt unequivocal act”. A mere intention of"
"the occupier’s part to transform the character of his occupation is ineffective [at page"
"110]."
"T
he pith and substance of “adverse possession” is that its basis is incompatible with"
"the owner’s title. If this element is capable of being proved at the commencement of"
"possession “adverse possession” is established from the outset. On the other hand, if"
"this quality attached to the possession of the party prescribing at a time subsequent"
"to the origin of physical occupation, the beginning of “adverse possession” is signified"
"by the change brought about in the nature and foundation of possession [at pages"
"110, 111].”"
