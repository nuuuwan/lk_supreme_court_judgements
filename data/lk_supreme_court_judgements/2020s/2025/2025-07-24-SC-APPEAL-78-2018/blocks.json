    "text": "Obeyesekere, J This is an appeal arising from the judgment delivered by the Civil Appellate High Court of the Western Province holden in Avissawella [the High Court] on 12th June 2017. Leave to appeal has been granted by this Court on four questions of law. While I shall refer to the said questions of law later in this judgment, it should perhaps suffice to state at this stage that the primary question that needs to be determined is whether the 2nd 5th Defendants Respondents Appellants [collectively, the Defendants] have established prescriptive rights to the corpus that is the subject matter of this appeal. Action in the District Court The Plaintiff Appellant Respondent [the Plaintiff] filed action in the District Court of Pugoda on 30th May 2003 seeking to partition the land morefully referred to in the schedule to the plaint. The plaint had set out the manner in which title had devolved on (a) the Plaintiff for an undivided 513/640 share of the said land, and (b) the 1st Defendant Respondent Respondent [the 1st Defendant], who is a brother of the Plaintiff, for an undivided 9/640 share of the same land. The Plaintiff had stated that the balance undivided share of 118/640 should devolve on the heirs of Jamis Perera Wanigasuriya but that details of the heirs of Jamis Perera Wanigasuriya are unknown, and for that reason, the said share must remain unallotted. The Plaintiff had therefore sought to partition the said land among the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and the heirs of Jamis Perera Wanigasuriya according to the above share ratio, with the 1st Defendant admitting his entitlement as pleaded in the plaint. The 2nd Defendant is a brother of the Plaintiffs father, Girigoris. The 3rd 5th Defendants are the sons of the 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiff had stated that the 2nd 5th Defendants are in illegal occupation of the corpus, and had sought to evict the Defendants from the corpus. While denying the pedigree pleaded by the Plaintiff, the Defendants took up the position that the land has not been properly identified, and that in any event, the 2nd Defendant has been in occupation of the said land since his birth, and the 3rd 5th Defendants for a period of over 50 years, and that they have thus prescribed to the said land. The Defendants also pleaded that all structures on the said land have been erected by them at",

Admissions and Issues were raised on 24th March 2009, with the Defendants raising Issue Nos. 6 and 7 on prescription. The case proceeded to trial thereafter. The 2nd Defendant passed away after giving evidence, and was substituted with the 2A Defendant. During the trial, it transpired that, (a) the said land belonged to the father of the 2nd Defendant [i.e. the grandfather of the Plaintiff] and that although deeds had been executed in favour of the father of the Plaintiff, the 2nd Defendant had continued to occupy part of the said land, (b) the Defendants did not have any title deeds to the said land, (c) over the years, the Defendants and the father of the Plaintiff had a dispute over the roadway leading to the land which resulted in an application being made under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Act, and (d) the 3rd Defendant had entered into a lease agreement in July 1997 with the father of the Plaintiff in respect of an undivided portion of one acre out of the said land that was the subject matter of the case for a period of five years that allowed the 3rd Defendant to cultivate pineapple and other minor crops on the land referred to therein. Judgments of the District Court and the High Court By its judgment delivered on 5th October 2016, the District Court held that the Plaintiff has not established the identity of the land and that in any event, the Plaintiff has failed to prove the pedigree. The claim of the Defendants that they have prescribed to the said land [Issue Nos. 6 and 7] was rejected on two grounds, to which I shall advert to later in this judgment. Aggrieved, the Plaintiff lodged an appeal with the High Court. The High Court concluded that (a) the land that was sought to be partitioned has been duly identified, (b) the Plaintiffs pedigree has been established, and (c) the land must be partitioned among the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and the heirs of Jamis Perera Wanigasuriya according to the share ratio pleaded in the plaint.

Although the High Court has not adduced any specific reason for the latter conclusion with regard to plantations, it appears from a perusal of the evidence that the High Court was mindful that the 2nd Defendant was in occupation of part of the land since the time the said land belonged to his father, and that the Defendants had cultivated the said land or part thereof during that period, as well as during the validity period of the lease agreement.

With the plaint having been dismissed, the necessity for the Defendants to file an appeal against the said finding of the District Court did not arise as the Defendants could have continued to possess the said land. However, with the Plaintiff having lodged an appeal, it was open for the Defendants to have acted in terms of Section 772 of the Civil Procedure Code or else, raised a question of law in that regard during the hearing of the appeal before the High Court. The Defendants did neither. That does not, in my view, prevent the Defendants from raising prescription before this Court, especially since the High Court ruled on the prescriptive rights of the Defendants.

I must state that the lease agreement is between the 3rd Defendant and the father of the Plaintiff, and the 4th Defendant was only a signatory thereto. Thus, the existence of the lease agreement would only affect the prescriptive rights of the 3rd Defendant.

However, if the occupier, at the commencement of his occupation, acknowledges the owners title, he is presumed to continue occupation in the identical capacity. In such a situation of this kind, possession adverse to the owner begins only when the basis of occupation has been changed by an overt unequivocal act. A mere intention of the occupiers part to transform the character of his occupation is ineffective [at page 110]. The pith and substance of adverse possession is that its basis is incompatible with the owners title. If this element is capable of being proved at the commencement of possession adverse possession is established from the outset. On the other hand, if this quality attached to the possession of the party prescribing at a time subsequent to the origin of physical occupation, the beginning of adverse possession is signified by the change brought about in the nature and foundation of possession [at pages 110, 111]. With regard to the onus probandi in the context of actions involving prescriptive title, the party who claims the benefit of prescriptive possession must undertake the burden of proof in a contest with the party who is able to point to a paper title, and must adduce evidence that points to a reasonable inference that he possessed the corpus in a character incompatible with, and adverse to the Plaintiffs title. It is clear from the evidence that the Defendants failed to place before the District Court on a balance of probability clear and cogent evidence to establish that they possessed the corpus or a part thereof uninterrupted and adverse to that of the Plaintiff for a period of ten years, either by proving that they entered upon the premises in a capacity inconsistent with the owners title or by proving a change in the character of possession from a dependent or subordinate capacity to that of an adverse capacity. The issue of prescription is primarily a question of fact which has to be determined in accordance with the circumstances peculiar to each case. It need not be demonstrated by a single identifiable act. Instead, such inference can be obtained from a state of things existing over a sustained period. With the issues involved in the proof of prescriptive title being primarily a question of fact, it was held in Robosingho Mudalali v Jayawardena [(1965) 72 NLR 193] that an appellate court is naturally reluctant, in the absence of",
