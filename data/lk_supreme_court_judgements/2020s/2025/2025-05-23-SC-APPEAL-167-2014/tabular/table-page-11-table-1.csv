"contrary  to  the  regulations  and/or  rules  and  therefore  those  decisions  were  made  ultra  vires"
"and/or there is an illegality attach to said decision. In this regard, Counsel for the Appellant"
"Board has quoted the texts mentioned below;"
"W
ade and Forsyth on ‘Administrative Law’ (10th Edition) at page 450:"
"“An expectation, whose fulfilment requires that a decision maker should make an unlawful"
"decision, cannot be legitimate expectation. It is inherent in many of the decisions and express"
"in  several  that  the  expectation  must  be  within  the  powers  of  the  decision  maker  before  any"
"question of protection arises.”"
"C
raig on ‘Administrative Law’ (6th Edition) at page 686:"
"“The concept of legitimate expectations should play the same general rule in this type of cases,"
"as in relation to intra vires representations. It is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for"
"the representation to bind the public body. Reasonableness of reliance is a necessary condition"
"for  a  legitimate  expectation.  It  might  be  objected  that  a  representee  could  never  have  a"
"“legitimate”  expectation  if  the  representation  was  ultra  vires.  This  is,  however,  merely  a"
"restatement of the general rule that ultra vires representations cannot ever bind, which is the"
"very question in issue.”"
"T
he above clearly indicates neither an expectation, of which the fulfilment requires the decision"
"maker to make an unlawful decision nor an expectation based on an ultra vires representation"
"can be legitimate expectation. It also indicates that reasonableness of reliance is a necessary"
"condition for a legitimate expectation. In the case at hand, previous granting of pension rights"
"to certain employees had been done in contravention of the regulations and/or rules. Thus, they"
"are ultra vires decisions. No reasonable reliance can be placed on such decisions. On the other"
"hand, to fulfil the so-called expectations of the 4th and 5th Respondents, the Appellant Board"
"has to make an unlawful decision against the pension regulations. Thus, those expectations of"
"the 4th and 5th Respondents cannot be identified as legitimate expectations."
"I
n Ariyarathne and Others v Inspector General of Police and Others (2019) 1 Sri L R 100"
"this Court held that “the law, as it presently stands, is that an assurance given ultra vires by a"
"public authority, cannot found a claim of a legitimate expectation based on that assurance."
"But, it has to be recognised that there may be many instances where a petitioner who relies on"
"an assurance given by a public authority or one of its officials, reasonably believed that the"
"public authority or official who gave it to him was acting lawfully and within their powers. It"
"is also often the case that an individual who deals with a public authority will find it difficult"
"to ascertain the extent of its powers and those of its officials. In such cases, much hardship will"
"be done to an individual who bona fide relies on an assurance given to him by a public authority"
"or one of its officials and is later told the assurance he relied on and acted upon, sometime"
"with much effort and at great cost to him, cannot be given effect to because of a flaw regarding"
"its vires. In such instances, the principle of legality comes into conflict with the principle of"
"certainty and, the law as it stands now, is that the illegality of the assurance will defeat the"
"value of certainty which contends that the assurance should be given effect."""
