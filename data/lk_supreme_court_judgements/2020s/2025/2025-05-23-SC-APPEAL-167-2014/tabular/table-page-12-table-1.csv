"The above indicates that one cannot rely on a previous action or practice which were ultra vires"
"to expect that there will be a certainty in following the same actions or practice in the same"
"manner in future similar happenings. Thus, there cannot be a legitimate expectation based on"
"an ultra vires action or practice that took place in the past. As said before, the adjustments,"
"relaxations or circumventions of the Pension Regulations and /or Rules done before are not"
"lawful and/or ultra vires. As per Regulation 18.1 in the aforesaid Gazette (vide pages No. 399"
"- 405) or rule 18.1 of the pension rules circulated via Circular No. 494 (vide pages 494 to 506),"
"amendments  to  the  regulations  or  rules  can  be  done  by  the  Appellant  Board  only  with  the"
"approval  of  the  Commissioner  of  Labour  and  the  Commissioner  of  Inland  Revenue.  No"
"submission has been made to indicate that such an amendment took place."

n  Walker  Sons  and  Co.  Ltd  v  Fry  68  N  L  R  73  and  Municipal  Council  of  Colombo  v"
"Munasinghe  and  four  Others  71  N  L  R  223  it  was  held  that  the  duty  to  make  a  just  and"
"equitable order as contemplated in Industrial Dispute Act does not allow the freedom of a wild"
"horse or ass in decision making. In Richard Pieris and Co. Ltd. v. Wijesiriwardena (1961)"
"62 NLR 233, it was held that “In regard to the power of the Tribunal to make such order as"
"may appear to it to be just and equitable there is point in Counsel’s submission that justice and"
"equity can themselves be measured not according to the urgings of a kind heart but only within"
"the framework of the law.”"
"C
eylon Tea Plantations Co. Ltd v Ceylon Estates Staffs’ Union (SC 211/72, SCM 15/5/74):"
"Rajaratnam J held that just and equitable order must be fair by the parties (vide Nigel Hatch"
"‘Commentary of the Industrial Disputes Act’ at page 277. This has also been referred to in SC"
"Appeal 25/2017, SC minutes 31.07.2020))."
"E
ven though, in some of the cases cited by the 4th and 5th Respondents, it is stated that the"
"Arbitrator has an unfettered discretion to do what he thinks is right and fair in making a just"
"and equitable order, that just and equitable order has to be one that can be identified within the"
"framework of law, and it has to be fair by the employee as well as the employer. In that sense,"
"the Arbitrator does not have a freedom of a wild horse to direct one party to take a decision in"
"breach of the law or regulations that the said party is bound to follow."
"A
s explained above, there is an illegality in the previous decisions of the Appellant Board to"
"adjust,  relax  or  circumvent  the  pension  regulations  to  grant  pension  rights  to  some  of  the"
"employees as they were made in contravention of the said regulations. Thus, they are ultra vires"
"decisions. Any right to equal treatment or a legitimate expectation cannot spring from them."
"Thus, there is an illegality in the decision of the 3rd Respondent Arbitrator which direct the"
"Appellant Board to do the same illegal or ultra vires act to grant pension rights to the 4th and"
"5th Respondents. This was sufficient to quash the Award made by the Arbitrator and the learned"
"Court of Appeal Judge erred in its decision to confirm the Award while refusing to issue a writ"
"of certiorari as prayed for by the Appellant Board. Hence, the Court of Appeal Judgement dated"
"10.02.2014 has to be set aside and the Award dated 02.10. 2008 has to be quashed."
