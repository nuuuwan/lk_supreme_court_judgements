[1] By Petition dated 05/02/2016, the Petitioner has alleged inter alia, that the

decisions taken to require the Petitioner to demolish a portion of her house by

the 1st to 3rd Respondents to this application has violated the Petitioner's

Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles 11, 12(1), and 14(1)(h) of the

Constitution. Having heard the submissions of the respective counsel, the

Petitioner was granted leave to proceed for the alleged violation of Articles 12(1)

and 14(1)(h) and to quash the letter dated 18/01/2016 [P10(a)] issued by the

2nd Respondent, the Municipal Commissioner.

[2] In paragraphs 4, 6 and 10, of the Petition, the Petitioner states that due to lack

of space, in or around 1995, the Petitioner set up a temporary construction

approximately 12 feet by 14 feet in extent, in front of the existing house, situated

within the housing complex named the Saranakara Housing Project, consisting

of 100 houses. Thereafter, in or around October 2015, the Petitioner set up a

permanent structure to the same extent, composed of two floors, with access to

the upper floor from a spiral staircase.

[3] In paragraph 11 of the Petition, the Petitioner states that by letter dated

18/01/2016, the 2nd Respondent informed the Petitioner that the construction

was unauthorized and directed the Petitioner to remove such construction by

25/01/2016. The Petitioner alleges that on 29/01/2016, with no prior notice,

several officers of the 3rd Respondent arrived at the premises, informed the

Petitioner that the new construction was unauthorized, and removed the spiral

staircase.

[4] Apart from the alleged mental trauma, indignity and humiliation caused to the

Petitioner and her family by the purported acts carried out by the officers of the

3rd Respondent, the Petitioner's position on the violation of Articles 12(1) and

14(1)(h) is premised on the alleged violations of the following legal provisions;

Page 4 of 11

• Delegation of authority under Sections 23(5) and 28A (1) of the Urban

Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 [as amended] (hereinafter

referred to as the UDA Act), enforced by the 2nd Respondent by letter dated

18/01/2016 [P10(a)], is illegal and ultra vires

• The 2nd Respondent cannot be delegated any authority to demolish or

demand the demolition of any unauthorized construction

• Section 28A (3) of the UDA law requires the institution of action in the

Magistrates Court to obtain an order for demolition.

[5] When this matter was taken up for hearing, the Petitioner's arguments were

based on the above legal position, which is morefully reflected in the written

submissions file of record.

[6] Section 23(5) of the UDA Act reads as follows;

“The Authority may delegate to any officer of a local authority, in consultation

with that local authority, any of its powers, duties and functions relating to

planning within any area declared to be a development area under section 3,

and such officer shall exercise, perform or discharge any such power, duty or

function so delegated, under the direction, supervision and control of the

Authority.”

[7] In response to the above, the Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 4th and

5th Respondents drew the attention of Court to document marked ‘4R1’ wherein,

the 4th Respondent Authority acting under the above Section 23(5) of the UDA

Act, has delegated the required power to the officers of the 1st Respondent, and

the 2nd and 3rd Respondents have acted under the delegated authority. The 1st

to 3rd Respondents denies demolishing the fences, removing the spiral staircase

and further reiterate that at all times material to this application, the

Respondents have acted within the limits of power conferred to them by law.

[8] Section 28A, introduced by the amending Act No. 4 of 1982, reads as follows;

“(1) Where in a development area, any development activity is commenced

continued, resumed or completed without permit or contrary to any term or

condition set out in a permit issued in respect of such development activity, the

Authority may, in addition to any other remedy available to the Authority

under this Law, by written notice require the person who is executing or has

executed such development activity, or has caused it to be executed, on or

before such day as shall be specified in such notice, not being less than seven

days from the date thereof

(a) to cease such development activity forthwith; or

(b) to restore the land on which such development activity is being executed or

has been executed, to its original condition; or

(c) to secure compliance with the permit under the authority of which that

development activity is carried out or engaged in, or with any term or

condition of such permit,

and for the purposes of compliance with the requirements aforesaid

(i) to discontinue the use of any or building; or

(ii) to demolish or alter any building or work.

(2) It shall be the duty of the person on whom a notice is issued under

subsection (1) (2) It shall be the duty of the person on whom a notice is issued

under subsection (1) to comply with any requirement specified in such notice

within the time specified in such notice or within, such extended time as may

be granted by the Authority on application made in that behalf.

(3) (a) Where any person has failed to comply with any requirement contained

in any written notice issued under subsection (1) within the time specified in

the notice or within such extended time as may have been granted by the

Page 6 of 11

Authority, the Authority may, by way of petition and affidavit, apply to the

Magistrate to make an Order authorizing the Authority to-

(a) to discontinue the use of any land or building;

(b) to demolish or alter any building or work;

(c) to do all such other acts as such person was required to do by such notice,

as the case may be, and the Magistrate shall after serving notice on the

person who had failed to comply with the requirements of the Authority

under subsection (1), if he is satisfied to the same effect, make order

accordingly.

(b) If such person undertakes to discontinue the use of the land or building or

to demolish or alter the building or work, or to do such other acts as are

referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection 3 of section 28A, the Magistrate

may, if he thinks fit, postpone the operation of the Order for such time not

exceeding two months as he thinks sufficient for the purpose of giving such

person an opportunity of complying with such requirement.

(4) Where a mandatory order has been made under subsection (3), it shall be

the duty of the police authorities to render all necessary assistance to the

Authority in carrying out the order.

(5) The Authority shall be entitled to recover any reasonable expenses incurred

by the Authority in demolishing or altering any building or work in pursuance

of an order made by the Magistrate under sub section (3).

(6) The preceding provisions of this section shall not affect any liability

incurred by such person by reason of his failure to comply with such notice.”

[9] In Wimal Withana vs. Paneer Selvam and Hon. Attorney General1 the

Supreme Court considered whether the powers conferred under Section 28A(3)

of the Urban Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978, as amended, fall

within the scope of “planning” as contemplated by Section 23(5) of the same

Act. The Court held that every subsection of Section 28A must be interpreted as

a whole without omitting any portion of it to give effect to the legislative intent.

It was held that Section 28A, in its entirety, inherently relates to the

implementation and enforcement of approved development plans, and

therefore the powers, duties, and functions set out in subsection (3), including

the institution of proceedings before a Magistrate’s Court for a mandatory order

to demolish or alter an unauthorized structure, are planning-related functions

capable of being delegated under Section 23(5).

Section 23(5) permits the Urban Development Authority to delegate any of its

powers, duties, and functions relating to planning to an officer of a local

authority, provided such delegation is made in consultation with the local

authority concerned and is subject to the supervision and control of the UDA.

The Court, in this case, held that such delegation is valid and binding, and

rejected the argument that actions taken under Section 28A(3) lie outside the

scope of lawful delegation. This position was reaffirmed in the case of S.A.

Rajalingam vs. D.M. Udaya Ranjith and Others2.

[10] Even though the conclusive findings made in the above case have direct

reference to the case at hand to reach its logical conclusion, I wish to pen down

the following positions taken in the statement of objections filed by the 1st to 3rd

Respondents.

[11] Considering the complaints received by the residents of the area, (R3 to R7) and

the notice sent to the Petitioner under Section 23(5) read with Section 28(a) (1)

1 (2012) 1 SLR 254 2 (SC Appeal 60/2017) decided on 18 - 06 - 2020

Page 8 of 11

of the UDA law marked P10 (a), the technical officer had inspected the

unauthorized construction and had advised the Petitioner to produce

documents and approved plans to substantiate her ownership to the relevant

portion of land.

[12] When the Petitioner was awarded the property by Deed No. 770 dated

24/04/2001, there was a proper plan, and the northern boundary of the land

was clearly shown as a 10-foot roadway, owned and maintained by the 3rd

Respondent. At no time did the Respondents take steps to demolish the garden

fence; however, there was an urgent need to clear the area to resurrect the 10-

foot-wide common road and the drainage system. The Petitioner constructed

the unauthorized structure on top of a drain closing and obstructing the

roadway of 50% of the residents in the scheme, thereby obstructing the

residents' free movement and preventing the 3rd Respondent from clearing and

maintaining the drain system. Due to the Petitioner’s disruption of the drain

system, at least one occupant has complained to the Human Rights

Commission. Photographs marked R8 (a) to R8 (d) are annexed to show the

Petitioner's unauthorized construction on top of the drain encroaching on the

common roadway and to the triangular-shaped portion to the northern

boundary.

[13] There was no garden fence since the construction of the unauthorized two-story

building. The spiral staircase was only a temporary fixture. The officers of the

Respondents have denied the demolition of the unauthorized construction or

any part thereof.

[14] Before any demolition was carried out, in terms of document P10 (a), the

Respondents were to obtain a court order in terms of the law.

[15] In their affidavits, the 1st and 2nd Respondents state that they have never taken

steps to demolish the garden fence, noting that no fence existed after the

construction of the unauthorized two-story building. It is submitted that

Page 9 of 11

clearing the area owned and maintained by the third Respondent had no

relevance to the Notice issued under Section 28A (1). The Respondents have

vehemently denied taking any steps to demolish the garden fence and the spiral

staircase.

[16] According to Section 28A (3)(a) of the UDA Act, subject to subsection (1), the

Authority may institute action under the procedure prescribed in the UDA Act.

Such an action shall be filed before the Magistrate to make a mandatory order

authorizing the Authority to demolish, alter the building, or work within the

specified period in the Notice or by such time granted by the Authority. The

Petitioner and her son-in-law, a person of direct interest to the subject matter,

in their respective affidavits, have pleaded the absence of due process in

complying with Section 28A (3)(a) of the UDA Act, prior to the removal of the

fence and the spiral staircase. The Petitioner’s son-in-law has attached several

photographs that are indicative of the presence of the officers of the 3rd

Respondent on the date the purported illegal acts were committed (X1 to X3),

however, not a single photograph shows the removal of the spiral staircase or

the fence by the officers present. As an interested party to the land, the evidence

presented to this Court of the alleged acts committed in violation of the

statutory provisions does not meet the required standard of proof and falls far

short of the degree of establishing an infringement of the Petitioner's legitimate

rights and expectations.

[17] This Court further observes that the grant of relief in Fundamental Rights

applications is subject to the equitable principle that a party seeking such relief

must come before Court with clean hands. While no finding has been made in

this case regarding suppression or misrepresentation of facts, every petitioner

must demonstrate that they have acted in good faith and by the law. The

equitable jurisdiction of this Court under Article 126 is not exercised in a

vacuum, and a petitioner’s conduct is a relevant consideration in assessing

Page 10 of 11

entitlement to relief. In this case, the Court has taken note of the Petitioner’s

conduct in proceeding with a construction admittedly lacking prior approval,

and encroaching on public utility space, as well as their failure to respond to

regulatory directives. While procedural compliance by the authorities is an

important consideration, it does not in itself entitle a petitioner to relief where

he has not acted in good faith.

[18] The Petitioner admits to the construction of a permanent structure in the place

of the temporary shed in or around October 2015. When the said illegal

construction was taking place, several residents of the housing scheme

petitioned the 2nd Respondent to take appropriate action to demolish the

construction to prevent the inconvenience caused to the residents. The

photographs attached to the statement of objections filed by the 1st to 3rd

Respondents are so compelling and clearly show the extent to which the

Petitioner's house protrudes into the roadway, thereby obstructing the free

movement of the neighboring residents and the drainage system.

[19] As discussed earlier in this Judgement, the UDA Act makes it abundantly clear

that ensuring the due implementation and enforcement of the powers

conferred/delegated to the 1st to 3rd Respondents under every subsection of

Section 28A is paramount in protecting the rights and liberties of all concerned

parties. The Petitioner's act of encroachment into the roadway, restricting the

taxpayer residents' movements and the peaceful enjoyment of common

facilities, is a clear violation of the law. This high-handed illegal act of the

Petitioner is frowned upon by this Court. The Court is equally mindful of the

wide and constructive powers vested with the Authority in terms of the law, to

be enforced in a purposive and meaningful manner that minimizes delay in

furtherance of due process. In all the above circumstances, the Respondents are

directed to demolish the unauthorized construction forthwith, in terms of the

law and procedure.

Page 11 of 11

[20] The Petitioners have failed to establish any violation of their rights guaranteed

under Article 12(1) or 14(1)(h) against any of the Respondents and, therefore, I

dismiss this Application. No order for costs.

[21] Application dismissed.
