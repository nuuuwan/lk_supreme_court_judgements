"of  the  UDA 
law  marked  P10  (a),  the  technical  officer  had 
inspected  the"
"unauthorized 
construction 
and  had 
advised 
the  Petitioner 
to  produce"
"documents and approved plans to substantiate her ownership to the relevant"
"portion of land."
"[12]  When 
the  Petitioner  was  awarded 
the  property  by  Deed  No.  770  dated"
"24/04/2001, there was a proper plan, and the northern boundary of the land"
"was  clearly  shown  as  a  10-foot  roadway,  owned  and  maintained  by  the  3rd"
"Respondent. At no time did the Respondents take steps to demolish the garden"
"fence; however, there was an urgent need to clear the area to resurrect the 10-"
"foot-wide common road and the drainage system. The Petitioner constructed"
"the  unauthorized  structure  on  top  of  a  drain  closing  and  obstructing  the"
"roadway  of  50%  of  the  residents 
in  the  scheme,  thereby  obstructing  the"
"residents' free movement and preventing the 3rd Respondent from clearing and"
"maintaining the drain system. Due to the Petitionerâ€™s disruption of the drain"
"system, 
at 
least  one  occupant  has 
complained 
to 
the  Human  Rights"
"Commission. Photographs  marked R8 (a) to R8 (d)  are  annexed to show the"
"Petitioner's unauthorized construction on top of the drain encroaching on the"
"common  roadway  and 
to 
the 
triangular-shaped  portion 
to 
the  northern"
"boundary."
"[13]  There was no garden fence since the construction of the unauthorized two-story"
"building. The spiral staircase was only a temporary fixture. The officers of the"
"Respondents have denied the demolition of the unauthorized construction or"
"any part thereof."
"[14]  Before  any  demolition  was  carried  out,  in  terms  of  document  P10  (a),  the"
"Respondents were to obtain a court order in terms of the law."
"[15]  In their affidavits, the 1st and 2nd Respondents state that they have never taken"
"steps  to  demolish  the  garden  fence,  noting  that  no  fence  existed  after  the"
"construction  of  the  unauthorized  two-story  building.  It 
is  submitted  that"
