Seneviratne on 6th June 1991 and 7th August 1991 respectively. The position taken up by the Plaintiff in this matter is that the afore-stated Deeds are forgeries and that the Plaintiff had not been the beneficiary of Deed of Transfer No. 11526 nor had she been the transferor of Deed No. 11940. Her position is that her title arises out of the title to the corpus inherited by her late husband, Jagath Pathmasiri Athukorala, who had passed away intestate on 24th November 1982. Furthermore, that through interstate succession, she inherited one half (1/2) of the estate of her late husband (including the corpus), and that her children \u2013 Janaka Athukorala and Shamini Indika inherited one-fourth (1/4) each. Thereafter, on 6th July 1991, both of her children gifted their shares to her by Deed of Gift No. 1420 attested by D.S. Rajapaksha, Notary Public. According to the Plaintiff, this resulted in her becoming the sole owner of the property in issue (corpus). As regards to proof of forgery, the Plaintiff\u2019s position is that, both impugned Deeds are ex-facie forgeries. That is in view of the fact that Notary Public E.G. Seneviratne, had passed away several years prior to the purported execution of both impugned Deeds. The Plaintiff filed the original action in the District Court seeking that the two impugned Deeds be declared fraudulent, and that, in the given circumstances, a declaration be issued that the said purported conveyances have no effect on the subject matter. Following the completion of the Pleadings, the Defendant had raised a preliminary issue that the Plaintiff would not be entitled in law to secure the reliefs prayed for, i.e., declarations that the two impugned deeds are forgeries and therefore, annulment of the said deeds. That was on the ground that the Plaintiff had not prayed for recognition of the Plaintiff\u2019s title. This preliminary issue had been considered by the learned District Judge and decided in favour of the Defendant, resulting in the dismissal of the Plaint. Consequent to an Appeal being filed against that dismissal of the Plaint, the High Court of Civil Appeals, by the Judgment which is being impugned before this Court, affirmed the finding of the learned District Judge. It is a matter of considerable debate as to whether a person who has a legitimate interest with regard to a piece of land can, without securing a declaration of title",

In other words, it is a matter of debate as to whether the two declarations sought by the Plaintiff arises out of sui generis causes of action independent of a cause of action which gives rise to a declaration of title. However, it is the view of this Court that this debatable matter need not necessarily be answered in this Appeal. That is in view of the fact that, though the Plaintiff in her Plaint had not prayed for a declaration reconising her title to the land, that position had been averred in the Plaint and a corresponding issue had been raised prior to the commencement of the trial. Thus, whether the Plaintiff was in-fact the holder of title of the land was in issue, and accordingly, had the case proceeded to a full trial, it would have been decided by the learned District Judge. It is trite law that once issues are raised, Pleadings recede to the background and the judicial adjudication of the case before the District Court must necessarily be founded upon the issues raised. In the circumstances, had the learned District Judge proceeded to trial in this matter, he would have had to necessarily determine whether the Plaintiff had title to the land as at the time she instituted civil legal action in the District Court. Therefore, the earlier mentioned interesting question of law remains a moot point, that need not be answered because in the proceedings before the District Court, the learned District Judge would have had to necessarily determine whether the Plaintiff had title. The learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Respondent being a true officer of Court, did indicate to Court that the afore-stated view of this Court as advanced by learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Appellant is correct. Nevertheless, he submitted that he had received very specific instructions from the Respondent not to concede this matter, and to await a Judgment from this Court. In the circumstances, while deciding both questions of law in respect of which Leave to Appeal has been granted in favour of the Appellant, this Court sets aside both the impugned Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeals and the Order on the preliminary issue pronounced by the learned District Judge. The learned District Judge is directed to immediately take up this matter for trial and give this trial precedent over all other matters and conclude the matter expeditiously. This is particularly in view of the inordinate delay that has occasioned due to the unnecessarily litigious conduct of the Defendant. Therefore, the learned District Judge is directed to take up this matter for trial and conclude it at the earliest possible opportunity, disregarding the present scheduling of cases as reflected in his official diary.",
