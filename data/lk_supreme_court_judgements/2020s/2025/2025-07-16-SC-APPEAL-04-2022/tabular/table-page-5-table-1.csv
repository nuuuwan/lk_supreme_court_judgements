"fail to consider whether an order under Section 90(1) of the Agrarian"
"Development Act can be made unless the commissioner is satisfied that"
"interference with the agricultural right of way will result in damage or"
"loss of crops or livestock. If so, did the Court of Appeal err in failing to"
"quash certiorari the order under Section 90(1) made by the commissioner"
"of Agrarian Development."
