"The petitioner pleads that he is the lawful owner of the land named"
"‘Madolaovita’, which is depicted in plan no. 1225 dated 02.07.1961, which he"
"claims that since purchasing the said land in 1986, the entire property had"
"been fenced off and that there was no pathway on the land identified as a"
"roadway or a foot path."
"The entire land consists of lots 1 and 2 on the abovementioned plan and the"
"three lands situated on the southern boundary of the land belongs to the 1st"
"and the 2nd respondents."
"He has further stated that in 2006, for the purpose of the development of his"
"land, he from his own money cleared a roadway by cutting across his land from"
"east to west and that he built a small house on lot 2. However, the owners on"
"the southern boundary had requested to use this pathway as a footpath and he"
"states that he agreed as a matter of courtesy. Eventually he had to replace the"
"barbed wire on the western boundary for the betterment of his rubber"
"cultivation and he had done so in the year 2008."
"The respondents, who had their land on the southern boundary, had"
"complained against him for obstructing the roadway which he says was built"
"by him from his own money, saying that they were unable to access their"
"agricultural land to the Commissioner of the Agrarian development department"
"and the complaints had been inquired into and had held after inquiry, on"
"12.08.2009, that the petitioner had obstructed the road under section 90(1) of"
"the Agrarian Development Act no. 46 of 2000."
"At the inquiry, the respondents had claimed that they used the roadway since"
"1951, including the use of vehicles and tractors, though the road is not shown"
"on the plan no. 1825. The 2nd respondent had corroborated the 1st respondent."
