"On 29.10.2014, the Petitioners travelled by public omnibus to Kirama near Walasmulla"
"in  the  Southern  Province  to  engage 
in  religious  community  service.  Petitioners"
"travelled in pairs, meeting with interested individuals in the neighbourhood providing"
"religious literature upon request."
"At around 12 noon, the Petitioners rejoined and walked along Walpitiya Road to the"
"bus  halt  near  the  Waldehigaha 
junction  at  which  point  a  Buddhist  monk  had"
"approached the Petitioners. The monk had come in a three-wheeler and asked if the"
"Petitioners  were  “distributing 
leaflets”.  The  Petitioners  explained  that  they  were"
"providing literature to interested persons who requested it. The Buddhist monk had"
"stepped  out  of  the  three-wheeler  and  proceeded  to  berate  the  Petitioners  for"
"distributing religious leaflets."
"The  situation  had  escalated  as  approximately  25  villagers  gathered  around  the"
"Petitioners,  some  demanding  to  confiscate  their  identity  cards,  prompting  fear  of"
"imminent physical assault.  Soon thereafter,  a civilian woman, later identified as the"
"Grama  Sevaka  of  the  area  (""2nd  Respondent""),  demanded  the  Petitioners'  identity"
"cards,  which  they  initially  refused.  This  had  angered  the  2nd  Respondent  and  she"
"abused the Petitioners in derogatory language. The 2nd Respondent then continued to"
"berate the Petitioners and acted in a threatening and intimidatory manner towards the"
"Petitioners. The 2nd Respondent expressed that only Sinhala Buddhists were welcome"
"in the area. Feeling threatened, the Petitioners contacted the 119 police emergency"
"hotline for assistance."
"At around 1.00 p.m., a Police jeep had arrived on the scene with two uniformed male"
"officers.  To  the  utter  surprise  and  dismay  of  the  Petitioners,  the  Police  Officers  had"
"joined the mob in abusing the Petitioners instead of protecting them from the mob."
"Thereafter, the Petitioners were directed to hand over any identification, with which"
"they all had complied."
