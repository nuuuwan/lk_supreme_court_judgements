"The  learned  Magistrate  granted  bail  for  the  four  suspects  after  hearing  Police  who"
"submitted that the situation was now under control. The 1st Respondent got to know"
"on  30.10.2014  that  the  Petitioners  were  able  to  furnish  bail  conditions  and  were"
"released. On 17.11.2014 after concluding investigations and considering the prevailing"
"situation, the prosecution requested the Court to discharge the four suspects."
"Version of the 2nd Respondent"
"On  29.10.2014  she  proceeded  to  the  Divisional  Secretariat  at  Walasmulla  in  her"
"uniform as part of her official duty. She returned to her jurisdiction by public transport."
"When she got down from the bus at Waldehigaha junction, which is within her division,"
"she observed that a large crowd of about 100 people including a Buddhist monk were"
"gathered near the junction."
"As she was the Grama Niladhari of the area, she proceeded to the place. The villagers"
"informed her  that four  unidentified  women  had come to the village and gone from"
"house to house telling the villagers to stop worshipping statues made out of clay and"
"to convert to Christianity. They further informed her that the four women had spoken"
"in a degrading manner towards Buddhism."
"The villagers were very disturbed due to the utterances made by the four persons who"
"she later came to identify as the four Petitioners. The villagers were further disturbed"
"because  the  Petitioners  had  refused  to  produce  any  identification  when  they  had"
"visited their houses."
"She  requested  the  Petitioners  to  produce  their  national  identity  cards  which  they"
"refused. Then the large crowd which consisted mostly of men got very agitated and"
"the situation became chaotic. There was an imminent threat of breach of peace. She"
"tried her best to protect the Petitioners from any physical harm when the Police arrived"
"at  the  scene.  She  denies  having  used  any  profane  language  on  the  Petitioners.  She"
"made a statement to the Walasmulla Police on the same day at 12.30 p.m."
