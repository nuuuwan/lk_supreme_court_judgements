"In interpreting “teaching”, his Lordship explained (at page 34) that:"
"“[t]he  act  of  “teaching”  involves  a  process  of  the  education  of  a  student  [or"
"group  of  students]  by  a  teacher  who,  by  means  of  instructions,  lessons  and"
"training, imparts knowledge and skills to the student [or students]. The resulting"
"process of “teaching” is usually consensual since, on the one hand, the teacher"
"voluntarily agrees to perform the duty of teaching and, on the other hand, the"
"student  voluntarily  seeks  the  teacher  because  he  wishes  to  learn  from  the"
"teacher.  The  act  of  “teaching”  is  usually  pre-arranged  and  entered  into  with"
"deliberation and for the individual benefit of both the teacher and the student."
"It  usually  takes  place  at  a  pre-determined  place  which 
is  known  to  and"
"convenient to both teacher and student. Usually, the identity of both the teacher"
"and  the  student  are  known  to  each  other  or  their  agents,  before  the  act  of"
"“teaching”  commences.  No  doubt,  there  will  be  instances  where  the  act  of"
"“teaching” occurs spontaneously, as for example where an elder teaches a child"
"or a friend teaches another friend. However, in general, it can be fairly said that,"
"the act of “teaching” is usually pre-arranged and consensual. Further, the act of"
"“teaching” usually involves a personal relationship between the teacher and the"
"student.”"
"I think it must be added that teaching is fundamentally directed towards educating a"
"person on a particular subject. Spread of a religion involves much more. It involves in"
"convincing a person of the truth and benefits of the religion with a view to convincing"
"him to embrace such religion."
"Subject to this observation, I have closely examined the process of reasoning adopted"
"and  find  no  compelling  reason  to  deviate  or  disagree  with  the  process  or 
its"
"conclusions.
