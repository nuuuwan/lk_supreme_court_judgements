"Perera v. Attorney General and Others [(1992) 1 Sri L.R. 199 at 200-201], it was held"
"“Freedom of speech by Article 14(1)(a) goes to the heart of the natural rights"
"of an organised freedom loving society to impart and acquire information. Of"
"that freedom one may say that it is the matrix, the indispensable condition of"
"nearly every other freedom. This freedom is not absolute. There is no such thing"
"as  absolute  and  unrestricted  freedom  of  speech  and  expression,  wholly  free"
"from  restraint  […]  On  similar  lines,  there  are  provisions  in  our  Constitution."
"Article 15(2) provides that the exercise and operation of the right of freedom"
"of  speech  and  expression  shall  be  subject  to  such  restrictions  as  may  be"
"prescribed by law in the interests of racial and religious harmony or in relation"
