"and  freedoms  of  others  or  of  meeting  the  just  requirements  of  the  general"
"welfare of a democratic society.”"
"Nevertheless,  the  Petitioners  were  not  exercising  their 
freedom  of  speech  and"
"expression including publication. They were involved in the external manifestation of"
"their religion or belief. While Article 10 recognises the fundamental freedom to have"
"or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, it is only Article 14(1)(e) which ensures the"
"fundamental 
freedom 
for 
its  external  manifestation.  However, 
the  Constitution"
"recognises  only four  modes of  such external manifestation in Article 14(1)(e) which"
"must be read as containing an exhaustive exposition of the external manifestation of"
"one’s religion or belief. What does not fall within Article 14(1)(e) as part of an external"
"manifestation of one’s religion or belief cannot be brought within Article 14(1)(a) under"
"the guise of freedom of speech and expression including publication."
"For  the  foregoing  reasons, 
I  hold  that  there  has  been  no 
infringement  of  the"
"fundamental 
rights  of 
the  Petitioners  guaranteed  by  Article  14(1)(a)  of 
the"
"Constitution."
"To  summarise,  the  1st  Respondent  has 
infringed  the  fundamental  rights  of  the"
"Petitioners guaranteed by Articles 12(1), 12(2) and 13(1) of the Constitution."
"The 1st Respondent is directed to pay Rs. 50,000/= to each Petitioner. Additionally, the"
"State is directed to pay Rs. 25,000/= to each Petitioner."
