"I am also of the view that the version of the incident presented by the Petitioners in"
"the pleadings appears to have been at times deliberately altered to cast the events in"
"a more favourable light, seemingly with the intention of impressing the Court. Such"

is  also  clear  to  me  that  the  Petitioners  were  subjected  to  this  discriminatory"
"treatment based on their religious affiliation."
