"In Piyasiri and Others v. Nimal Fernando and Others [(1988) 1 Sri L.R. 173 at 184] it"
"was held that:"
"“No  Police  Officer  has  the  right  to  arrest  a  person  on  a  vague  and  general"
"suspicion,  not  knowing  the  precise  crime  suspected  but  hoping  to  obtain"
"evidence of the commission of some crime for which they have the power to"
"arrest.  Even  if  such  evidence  comes  to  light  the  arrest  will  be  illegal  because"
"there will have been no proper communication of the reason for the: arrest to"
"the accused at the time of the arrest”. (emphasis added)"
