"practice and propagate religion."
"Chaudhuri [supra. page 321] states that:"
"“Freedom of conscience would be meaningless unless it were implemented by"
"the  freedom  of  unhampered  expression  of  spiritual  conviction  in  word  and"
"action. Freedom to profess means the right of the believer to state his creed in"
"public, whereas freedom to practice implies  his right to give its expression in"
"forms of private and public worship.”"
