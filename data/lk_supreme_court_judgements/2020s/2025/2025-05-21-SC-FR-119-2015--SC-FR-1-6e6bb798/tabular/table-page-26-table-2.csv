"In Yick Wo v. Hopkins [(1886) 118 U.S. 356 at 373-374] the US Supreme Court held"
"that:"
"“[t]hough the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it"
"is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal"
"hand,  so  as  practically  to  make  unjust  and  illegal  discriminations  between"
"persons  in  similar  circumstances,  material  to  their  rights,  the  denial  of  equal"
"justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution.”"
