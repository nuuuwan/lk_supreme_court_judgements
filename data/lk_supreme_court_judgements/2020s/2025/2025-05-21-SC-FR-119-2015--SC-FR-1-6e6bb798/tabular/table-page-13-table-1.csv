"guaranteed  by  our  Constitution  must  be  understood  bearing 
in  mind  the  basic"
"structure of the Constitution. Here I am not referring to the basic structure doctrine as"
"understood 
in 
Indian  constitutional 
jurisprudence  which  was  developed  by  the"
"Supreme  Court  of  India  in  a  series  of  cases  culminating  in  Kesavananda  Bharati  v."
"State of Kerala [AIR 1973 Supreme Court 1461, 1973 4 SCC 225]."
"I  am  referring  to  the  basic  structure  of  the  fundamental  rights  chapter 
in  our"
"Constitution.  While 
it  guarantees  several 
fundamental 
rights, 
the  exercise  and"
"enjoyment of some of such fundamental rights are restricted while some fundamental"
"rights are not subject to any restrictions."
"For  example,  the  fundamental  right  to  the  freedom  of  thought,  conscience  and"
"religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice"
"guaranteed by Article 10 and the fundamental right to be free from torture or cruel,"
"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment enshrined in Article 11 are not subject"
"to any restrictions. They are in that sense absolute rights."
"On

"fundamental right to freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention and  punishment and"
"prohibition 
of 
retrospective 
penal 
legislation 
guaranteed 
by  Article 
13 
and"
"fundamental 
rights  of 
freedom  of 
speech,  assembly,  association,  occupation,"
"movement guaranteed by Article 14 and the fundamental right of  right to access of"
"information  guaranteed  by  Article  14A  are  subject  to  several  restrictions 
in  the"
"interests  of  national 
security, 
racial  and 
religious  harmony  or 
in 
relation 
to"
"parliamentary privilege, contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence,"
"national economy, territorial integrity or public safety or other specified concerns."
"Accordingly,  there  is  a  clear  interface  by  design  between  the  fundamental  rights"
"guaranteed  by  Articles  10  and  11  on  one  hand  and  the  other  fundamental  rights"
"guaranteed by the Constitution. Any interpretation of Chapter III of the Constitution"
"must be done within this context. A contrary approach permits the fundamental rights"
"guaranteed in Articles 10 and 11, which are absolute in the sense described above, to"
