The 1st to 4th Petitioners (Petitioners) are the Petitioners in S. C. (F. R.) Application

Nos. 119/2015, 120/2015, 121/2015 and 122/2015 respectively. They are interrelated

cases and were consolidated with the agreement of parties and taken up for joint

consideration.

All four Petitioners are females and avowedly affiliated with the Christian Congregation

of Jehovahs Witnesses based in Kadawatha. The Petitioner in S. C. (F. R.) Application

No. 119/2015 (1st Petitioner) is 59 years old and has been a Jehovahs Witness for

over 21 years at the time of instituting this application. Similarly, Petitioner in S. C. (F.

R.) Application No. 120/2015 (2nd Petitioner) is 49 years old and has been a Jehovahs

Witness for over 4 years. Petitioner in S. C. (F. R.) Application No. 121/2015 (3rd

Petitioner) is 20 years old and has been a Jehovahs Witness for over 10 years, and

Petitioner in S. C. (F. R.) Application No. 122/2015 (4th Petitioner) is a 16-year-old

minor girl who claims to have been a Jehovahs Witness for over 14 years at the time

this application was instituted.

Version of the Petitioners

Jehovahs Witnesses are a recognized traditional religion followed by a considerable

community of Sri Lankans. They engage in public as well as in private to manifest their

religion and observe, practice and teach such religion, similar to other main religions

in Sri Lanka. They have been present in Sri Lanka since about 1910. They have always

exercised their rights peacefully in terms of Article 10 read with Article 14(1)(e) of the

Constitution.

One aspect of worship of Jehovahs Witnesses is preaching and declaring the good

news of the Kingdom of God (i.e., informing individuals of the basic tenants of their

faith) as reflected in the Bible, Matthew 24:14 and Luke 8:1. To that end, Jehovahs

Witnesses world over engages in such religious community service, visiting people in

their homes, and providing the opportunity to any individual to learn more about the

Page 4 of 32

Bible message. They habitually carry several publications/literatures when engaging in

such community service.

On 29.10.2014, the Petitioners travelled by public omnibus to Kirama near Walasmulla

in the Southern Province to engage in religious community service. Petitioners

travelled in pairs, meeting with interested individuals in the neighbourhood providing

religious literature upon request.

At around 12 noon, the Petitioners rejoined and walked along Walpitiya Road to the

bus halt near the Waldehigaha junction at which point a Buddhist monk had

approached the Petitioners. The monk had come in a three-wheeler and asked if the

Petitioners were distributing leaflets. The Petitioners explained that they were

providing literature to interested persons who requested it. The Buddhist monk had

stepped out of the three-wheeler and proceeded to berate the Petitioners for

distributing religious leaflets.

The situation had escalated as approximately 25 villagers gathered around the

Petitioners, some demanding to confiscate their identity cards, prompting fear of

imminent physical assault. Soon thereafter, a civilian woman, later identified as the

Grama Sevaka of the area ("2nd Respondent"), demanded the Petitioners' identity

cards, which they initially refused. This had angered the 2nd Respondent and she

abused the Petitioners in derogatory language. The 2nd Respondent then continued to

berate the Petitioners and acted in a threatening and intimidatory manner towards the

Petitioners. The 2nd Respondent expressed that only Sinhala Buddhists were welcome

in the area. Feeling threatened, the Petitioners contacted the 119 police emergency

hotline for assistance.

At around 1.00 p.m., a Police jeep had arrived on the scene with two uniformed male

officers. To the utter surprise and dismay of the Petitioners, the Police Officers had

joined the mob in abusing the Petitioners instead of protecting them from the mob.

Thereafter, the Petitioners were directed to hand over any identification, with which

they all had complied.

Page 5 of 32

Following the arrival of the two male police officers, another police jeep had arrived

with the Officer-in-Charge (OIC), Inspector of Police S. J. B. Suwaris (1st Respondent),

a uniformed male officer, a uniformed Woman Police Constable and two individuals in

civilian clothing. The 1st Respondent had also berated the Petitioners for coming to the

Kirama area to allegedly spread the Petitioners religion for financial gain. The

Petitioners immediately realised that the 1st Respondent was under a misapprehension

of the true facts, and all attempts by the Petitioners to explain their position failed.

The manner in which the 2nd Respondent Grama Sevaka and the officers of the

Walasmulla Police Station abused the Petitioners in such profane language created fear

and anguish in the minds of the Petitioners.

At around 1.30 p.m., the Petitioners were taken to the Walasmulla Police Station in a

police jeep. The Petitioners had not been informed of any reasons as to why they had

to accompany the Police to the Police Station but were only asked to surrender their

mobile phones, which they did.

The Petitioners were taken to the office of the 1st Respondent, who questioned the

Petitioners as to why they had come to Kirama and what they were doing in that area.

The Petitioners explained that they were Jehovahs Witnesses, and in accordance with

their religious beliefs, had come to the area to visit people at their homes. The 1st

Respondent confiscated all the religious literature that was in their possession.

At around 3.30 p.m., a statement was recorded from the Petitioners, which none of

them were permitted to read, but nevertheless signed, fearing repercussions if they

did not. At around 4.30 p.m., the Petitioners were informed by the officers of the

Walasmulla Police Station that they would be produced before a Magistrate. The

Petitioners were not informed of the reasons for such action nor the alleged charges

against any of them.

The Petitioners were later made aware that members of their congregation had

attempted to speak with the 1st Respondent through telephone to ascertain the

Page 6 of 32

charges and to arrange for legal representation for the Petitioners. The 1st Respondent

had misled their congregation members stating that the Petitioners would be released

after recording their statements.

At around 4.45 p.m., the Petitioners were taken to the nearby Walasmulla Magistrates

Court. At around 5.00 p.m., after the Police had acted in a misleading manner that

prevented the Petitioners from obtaining legal assistance, the Police Officers who

escorted the Petitioners to the Magistrates Court, had informed the Petitioners to

retain an Attorney-at-Law who was at the Court complex at the time. However, due to

the lateness of the hour, the Petitioners were not granted sufficient time to adequately

instruct such Attorney-at-Law before being produced before the learned Magistrate in

chambers. On being produced before the learned Magistrate, the Petitioners were not

questioned nor were they permitted to speak.

The Petitioners are now aware that they were granted bail, but due to the actions of

the Police in misleading the members of their congregation, they were unable to

furnish bail of Rs. 100,000/- each.

At or around 6.00 p.m., to the Petitioners utter surprise and dismay, they were forced

to walk along the public road flanked by Police Officers who had carried four sets of

handcuffs. The Petitioners were forced to travel by public omnibus (for which they

were required to purchase tickets) to Tangalle Prison where they were detained for one

night. Being paraded around in public in such a manner as if they were criminals

created a deep sense of shame and humiliation.

On 30.10.2014 at around 11.15 a.m., the Petitioners were taken from Tangalle Prison

to the Walasmulla Magistrates Court. The Petitioners later became aware that

members of their congregation had made representations to the Walasmulla

Magistrate Court and the Petitioners were released on furnishing bail (P5).

On 17.11.2014, the Petitioners were required to attend Court, at which point they were

discharged from the case (P3).

Page 7 of 32

On 25.11.2014, the Petitioners submitted a complaint to the Human Rights

Commission regarding the treatment suffered by them at the hands of the

Respondents.

Version of the 1st Respondent

He received a telephone call around 12 noon on 29.10.2014 that four suspicious

looking women had come to the Waldehigaha junction and that they were trying to

distribute leaflets going from house to house in the village and that they were talking

in a manner that condescends Buddhism.

Based on this information, the 1st Respondent left the Police Station at about 12.15

p.m. with PC 32883, PC 9575 and WPC 5462 Dammika in Police jeep bearing number

WPKO 8924 driven by PC Dharmadasa to investigate this matter.

They arrived at the place of incident at about 12.25 p.m. and noticed that there were

about 100 persons including the 2nd Respondent and some Buddhist monks. These

persons were agitated and the situation was disturbing the peace in the area. The

Petitioners and the 2nd Respondent were surrounded by these people. The 2nd

Respondent was doing her best to prevent the villagers from harming the Petitioners

and to keep peace.

As soon as the 1st Respondent arrived at the scene, the angry villagers informed him

that the Petitioners who were not from the area were speaking in a manner degrading

Buddhism and stating that it is a useless religion. They had further told the villagers to

come to God.

The angry mob further informed the 1st Respondent that the Petitioners were very

suspicious and that they might have come to the area to commit an offence in the guise

of trying to spread a foreign religion. They also informed that the Petitioners were

refusing to disclose their identity even after the questioning by the 2nd Respondent and

that they have behaved in a manner that caused alarm to the villagers which led to a

breach of peace in the area.

Page 8 of 32

Upon being questioned by the 1st Respondent, the Petitioners reluctantly disclosed

their identity and that they were believers of Jehovahs Witnesses faith and that they

had come to the area to spread their religion.

Due to the conduct of the Petitioners, there was an imminent threat of breach of

peace. Therefore the 1st Respondent got WPC 5462 Dammika to arrest the Petitioners

at 13.30 on suspicion.

The 1st Respondent took immediate steps to remove the Petitioners from the place and

took them to Walasmulla Polce Station as they were in eminent danger of physical

harm by the villagers.

The documents that were with the Petitioners were taken into custody for investigation

and entered under production register number 818/14.

A Buddhist monk came to the Police station and informed the 1st Respondent that

suspicious looking women are degrading Buddhism and their conduct is highly

suspicious. A statement from the Buddhist monk was recorded.

The statements of the Petitioners were recorded around 13.40. Their statements

revealed that they were residents of Gampaha district. The 1st Respondent made

inquiries from the police stations in Gampaha district to verify if they are persons

involved in any criminal case.

The Petitioners had gone to Waldehigaha and Batagasa areas which are very

remote areas of the Walasmulla Police jurisdiction where the crime rate is high. They

appear to have gone to these areas to spread a religion, which was foreign to the

villagers causing alarm which was likely to result in breach of peace leading to a

commotion and/or riot causing injury to persons and damage to property. Therefore,

the 1st Respondent decided to report facts to the Walasmulla Magistrate and produce

the Petitioners before the Magistrate. They were produced at 15.35 on the same day.

Page 9 of 32

The learned Magistrate granted bail for the four suspects after hearing Police who

submitted that the situation was now under control. The 1st Respondent got to know

on 30.10.2014 that the Petitioners were able to furnish bail conditions and were

released. On 17.11.2014 after concluding investigations and considering the prevailing

situation, the prosecution requested the Court to discharge the four suspects.

Version of the 2nd Respondent

On 29.10.2014 she proceeded to the Divisional Secretariat at Walasmulla in her

uniform as part of her official duty. She returned to her jurisdiction by public transport.

When she got down from the bus at Waldehigaha junction, which is within her division,

she observed that a large crowd of about 100 people including a Buddhist monk were

gathered near the junction.

As she was the Grama Niladhari of the area, she proceeded to the place. The villagers

informed her that four unidentified women had come to the village and gone from

house to house telling the villagers to stop worshipping statues made out of clay and

to convert to Christianity. They further informed her that the four women had spoken

in a degrading manner towards Buddhism.

The villagers were very disturbed due to the utterances made by the four persons who

she later came to identify as the four Petitioners. The villagers were further disturbed

because the Petitioners had refused to produce any identification when they had

visited their houses.

She requested the Petitioners to produce their national identity cards which they

refused. Then the large crowd which consisted mostly of men got very agitated and

the situation became chaotic. There was an imminent threat of breach of peace. She

tried her best to protect the Petitioners from any physical harm when the Police arrived

at the scene. She denies having used any profane language on the Petitioners. She

made a statement to the Walasmulla Police on the same day at 12.30 p.m.

Page 10 of 32

Leave to proceed has been granted under Articles 10, 12 (1), 12 (2), 13 (1), 14 (1) (a)

and 14 (1) (e) of the Constitution.

I will examine the alleged infringements of the fundamental rights guaranteed under

Articles 10, 13(1), 12(1) and 12(2), 14(1)(e) and 14(1)(a) in that order. Before

proceeding to do so, it is important to characterize the activity the Petitioners were

engaged in on the day of the incident.

Characterization

It is interesting to note that although the Petitioners claim that their fundamental

rights guaranteed by Articles 10, 12(1) and 12(2), 14(1)(a) and 14(1)(e) have been

infringed, they have refrained from characterizing their actions on the day of the

incident. They do not specifically claim to have been teaching, propagating or

practicing Christianity. The closest they come to characterising their actions into one

or more of the rights in Chapter III of the Constitution is the claim to have been

engaged in religious community service.

The Petitioners claim to have been visiting people in their homes, and providing an

opportunity to any individual to learn more about the Bible message. According to the

Petitioners one aspect of worship of Jehovahs Witnesses is preaching and declaring

the good news of the Kingdom of God. They travelled in pairs, meeting with interested

individuals in the neighbourhood providing religious literature upon request.

I am not convinced that their interactions were limited to meeting with interested

individuals and providing religious literature upon request. It is inconceivable that such

actions alone could lead to around 100 people surrounding the Petitioners and acting

in an agitated manner. It is more probable that the Petitioners did approach people

even without any request and sought to distribute religious literature and indulge in a

conversation about their faith. Admittedly, this included visiting people at their homes

without any invitation.

In Karuwalagaswewa Vidanelage Swarna Manjula and Another v. Pushpakumara

O.I.C. Kekirawa Police Station and Others [S.C. (F.R.) No. 241/2014, S.C.M.

18.07.2018], it was necessary to characterise the activities of Jehovahs Witnesses.

After a comprehensive analysis, Prasanna Jayawardena P.C., J. considered [pages 35-

36]1 the door-to-door ministry by Jehovahs Witnesses in that case amounted to

propagation. Propagation in the context of religion was held to mean the spreading of

religion.

I have closely compared the factual features of these four applications with that in

Karuwalagaswewa Vidanelage Swarna Manjula and Another (supra). I see no reason

to conclude that the four Petitioners in this application were acting in a manner

contrary to the conduct of the Petitioner in that case. All of them were members of

Jehovahs Witnesses and were engaged in door-to-door ministry. That is propagation.

Article 10

The issue for determination is whether the act of propagation of their religion by the

Petitioners amount to the exercise of the fundamental rights guaranteed to them by

Article 10. In the event the answer is in the affirmative, I must proceed to determine

whether the acts or inactions of any one or more of the Respondents have infringed

such fundamental rights of the Petitioners.

Article 10 guarantees to every person the freedom of thought, conscience and religion,

including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice. This is a

freedom guaranteed to every person rather than a citizen.

As Chaudhuri points out [Law of Writs and Fundamental Rights (Law Book Co., 1958),

320]:Conscience means the internal knowledge or judgment of right or wrong.

Freedom of conscience means that every man is free to think his own thoughts and to

have own opinions about religion and morality. (emphasis added)

1 It is evident to me that, the character of a programme of house-to-house visits carried out as part of a public ministry of Jehovahs Witnesses [which was identified earlier], falls squarely within the description of an act of propagation.

Page 12 of 32

Moreover, in Ratilal Panachand Gandhi v. State of Bombay [(1954) SC 388, (1954) AIR

388] it was held that freedom of conscience connotes a persons right to entertain

beliefs and doctrines concerning matters which are regarded by him to be conducive

to his spiritual well-being.

A closer examination of this fundamental right makes it clear that it recognises each

persons right to embrace a faith of his or her choice without any interference by an

extraneous factor. In Provincial of the Teaching Sisters of the Holy Cross of the Third

Order of Saint Francis in Menzingen of Sri Lanka (Incorporation) Bill (2003) [Decisions

of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (1991-2003), Vol. VII, page 409 at 413-

414] it was held that Article 10 postulates the right to adopt a religion or belief of a

persons choice.

Freedom of thought, conscience and religion are cornerstones of democratic societies.

These fundamental freedoms have found recognition in many domestic and

international legal documents in diverse formulations.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Article 18 states that [e]veryone has the

right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to

change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others

and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship

and observance.

Article 18 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that

[e]veryone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This

right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and

freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to

manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.

In these international legal texts, it appears that the freedom of thought, conscience

and religion is sometimes intertwined with its manifestation. Nevertheless, the

freedom of thought, conscience and religion as well as all other fundamental rights

Page 13 of 32

guaranteed by our Constitution must be understood bearing in mind the basic

structure of the Constitution. Here I am not referring to the basic structure doctrine as

understood in Indian constitutional jurisprudence which was developed by the

Supreme Court of India in a series of cases culminating in Kesavananda Bharati v.

State of Kerala [AIR 1973 Supreme Court 1461, 1973 4 SCC 225].

I am referring to the basic structure of the fundamental rights chapter in our

Constitution. While it guarantees several fundamental rights, the exercise and

enjoyment of some of such fundamental rights are restricted while some fundamental

rights are not subject to any restrictions.

For example, the fundamental right to the freedom of thought, conscience and

religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice

guaranteed by Article 10 and the fundamental right to be free from torture or cruel,

inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment enshrined in Article 11 are not subject

to any restrictions. They are in that sense absolute rights.

On the contrary, the fundamental right to equality guaranteed by Article 12,

fundamental right to freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention and punishment and

prohibition of retrospective penal legislation guaranteed by Article 13 and

fundamental rights of freedom of speech, assembly, association, occupation,

movement guaranteed by Article 14 and the fundamental right of right to access of

information guaranteed by Article 14A are subject to several restrictions in the

interests of national security, racial and religious harmony or in relation to

parliamentary privilege, contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence,

national economy, territorial integrity or public safety or other specified concerns.

Accordingly, there is a clear interface by design between the fundamental rights

guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 on one hand and the other fundamental rights

guaranteed by the Constitution. Any interpretation of Chapter III of the Constitution

must be done within this context. A contrary approach permits the fundamental rights

guaranteed in Articles 10 and 11, which are absolute in the sense described above, to

Page 14 of 32

be made subject to restrictions on the basis of those fundamental rights also falling

within another fundamental right which is subject to restrictions. Conversely it is

possible to claim that a fundamental right which is subject to restrictions is absolute

as that fundamental right also falls within a fundamental right which is absolute.

The fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 10 are dealing with internal

manifestation of thought, conscience and religion. A thought however dangerous

cannot cause any harm until and unless it is sought to be manifested externally. That is

one reason why Article 10 is not subject to any restrictions.

In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette [319 U.S. 624 (1943)], the US

Supreme Court struck down a law that forced public schoolchildren to salute the flag,

holding that the government may not prescribe what shall be orthodox inother

matters of opinion. This decision established that the State cannot penetrate the mind

to dictate beliefs, even by compelling symbolic acts.

However, the external manifestation of thought, conscience and religion can impinge

on individual rights and thus can be regulated in wider interest.

Thus Reynolds v. United States [98 U.S. 145 (1878)] affirmed that belief is absolutely

protected, whereas action motivated by belief may be regulated when it conflicts with

valid secular interests.

Again in Cantwell v. Connecticut [310 U.S. 296 (1940)], it was held that the

constitutional inhibition of legislation on the subject of religion has a double aspect.

On the one hand, it forestalls compulsion by law of the acceptance of any creed or the

practice of any form of worship. Freedom of conscience and freedom to adhere to such

religious organization or form of worship as the individual may choose cannot be

restricted by law. On the other hand, it safeguards the free exercise of the chosen form

of religion. Thus, the First Amendment embraces two concepts -- freedom to believe

and freedom to act. The first is absolute, but, in the nature of things, the second cannot

be. Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society.

Page 15 of 32

Hence although Article 10 goes on to state that the freedom of thought, conscience

and religion includes the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of ones

choice, the other constituents of this freedom does not include external manifestation

of ones thought, conscience or religion.

There are some domestic constituent documents where the internal and external

manifestations are intertwined. Article 25(1) of the Indian Constitution states that,

subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of that Part, all

persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess,

practice and propagate religion. There we see a blend of the internal element of the

freedom of conscience with its external manifestation, namely the right to profess,

practice and propagate religion.

Chaudhuri [supra. page 321] states that:

Freedom of conscience would be meaningless unless it were implemented by

the freedom of unhampered expression of spiritual conviction in word and

action. Freedom to profess means the right of the believer to state his creed in

public, whereas freedom to practice implies his right to give its expression in

forms of private and public worship.

During the hearing, we pointedly sought the response of the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioners on where belief ends and manifestation begins.

He invited Court to consider the approach of the UNHRC [Boodoo v. Trinidad and

Tobago (721/1996),ICCPR,A/57/40,Vol;.11 (2 April, 2002), at para 6.6], where in

harmony with Article 18 of the ICCPR, the Committee reaffirmed:

[t]he freedom to manifest religion or belief in worship, observance, practice

and teaching encompasses a broad range of acts and (that) the concept of

worship extends to ritual and ceremonial acts giving expression to belief as well

as various practices integral to such acts.

Page 16 of 32

However, in our Constitution, the internal and external constituents of the freedom of

religion are dealt in two different provisions, namely Articles 10 and 14(1)(e) of the

Constitution. They are independent constitutional rights with separate identities. Their

violations must be independently established. A contrary interpretation is inconsistent

with the basic structure of Chapter III and makes the restrictions on the fundamental

rights guaranteed by Article 14(1)(e) redundant.

The fundamental right recognized by Article 10 does not empower a person to state

freely what ones thoughts are, including proclaiming his belief. Should external

manifestation of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 10 form part of such

right, it is illogical to recognize only the proclamation of ones belief. Manifestation of

all thought, conscience and religion must also be recognized. Such recognition of an

absolute fundamental right will have far reaching consequences on the dignity and

reputation of other persons as well as leading to public disquiet when such right is

exercised on religious matters.

The external manifestation of the freedom of thought, conscience and religion,

including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice must fall

within Articles 14(1)(a) or 14(1)(e) as the case may be. I shall advert to this aspect later

in detail when considering the alleged violations of those fundamental rights.

On the day of the incident, the Petitioners were propagating their religion. It is an

external manifestation of ones belief or religion. That does not form part of the

fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 10.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that there has been no violation of the Petitioners

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 10 of the Constitution.

Article 13(1)

Article 13 (1) of the Constitution states that:

13. (1) No person shall be arrested except according to procedure established

by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest.

Page 17 of 32

This provision has two parts. The first prescribes that an arrest must be done according

to lawful procedure, while the second requires that the reasons for the arrest must be

informed.

In the assessment of any violation under Article 13 (1), the questions that arise are 1)

if there was an arrest, if so, 2) whether the arrest was made according to the procedure

established by law, and 3) if the reasons for the arrest were informed to the Petitioners

at the time of arrest.

It is considered that a person has been arrested when he is required or directed by a

police officer to go to a Police Station and he is, thereby, compelled, by the nature of

that requirement or direction, to go to the Police Station against his wishes.

[Namasivayam v. Gunawardena (1989) 1 Sri.L.R. 394; Piyasiri v. Fernando (1988) 1

Sri L.R. 173]. Given the circumstances where the Petitioners were escorted to the

Walasmulla Police station, detained, their religious publications confiscated, and their

mobile phones seized, followed by them been produced before the Walasmulla

Magistrate, it is unequivocal that the Petitioners were arrested.

The question then is whether the proper procedure was followed in making the arrest.

In the Channa Peiris v. Attorney General [(1994) 1 Sri L.R. 1 at 27] it was held that:

The procedure generally established by law for arresting a person without a

warrant are set out in Chapter IV B (Sections 32-43) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. Where a person is arrested without a warrant otherwise than in

accordance with these provisions, Article 13(1) of the Constitution will be

violated.

Petitioners submitted that they were arrested and detained in jail overnight on

suspicion of having committed offences which were not based on any reasonable

suspicion or credible complaint. They further allege of been subject to abuse and

religious criticism while in custody which was malicious discrimination in violation of

their fundamental rights.

Page 18 of 32

The 1st Respondent claims that he received information that the Petitioners were

talking in a manner that degrades and condescends Buddhism and that it is a useless

religion. Due to the conduct of the Petitioners, there was an imminent threat of breach

of peace in the area and as a consequence, he had instructed WPC Dammika to take

the Petitioners to the Walasmulla Police station as there was an imminent threat of

physical harm by the villagers.

The Petitioners countered that the statements recorded by the Walasmulla Police

station were contradictory as the arresting officers had acted under dictation, the

arrest was tainted with malice, was arbitrary and contrary to law, there was no

reasonable suspicion or credible information of the committal of a cognizable offence

by the Petitioners, and the purported arrest and detention were made prior to any

reasonable investigation.

The Petitioners were produced by the report (P3) which is referable to a report filed

under Section 115(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure No. 15 of 1979 as amended

(Code).

Section 115(1) of the Code reads as follows:

Whenever an investigation under this Chapter cannot be completed within the

period of twenty-four hours fixed by section 37, and there are grounds for

believing that further investigation is necessary the officer in charge of the police

station or the inquirer shall forthwith forward the suspect to the Magistrate

having jurisdiction in the case and shall at the same time transmit to such

Magistrate a report of the case, together with a summary of the statements, if

any made by each of the witnesses examined in the course of such investigation

relating to the case.

In Mohamed Razik Mohamed Ramzy v. Senaratne and Others [S.C.F.R. Application

No. 135/2020, S.C.M. 14.11.2023] my learned brother Kodagoda, P.C., J. held (at page

47) as follows:

To enable the Magistrate to determine whether criminal proceedings against

the suspect should be initiated and whether it would be expedient to detain the

suspect in remand custody, the Report submitted under section 115(1) should

contain one or more specific allegations that the suspect being produced has

committed one or more offences, and the report along with the summary of

statements must contain material based upon which the Magistrate can

determine whether it is expedient to detain the suspect. If the officer in charge

of the police station on whom the statutory duty is cast to submit the report

along with the summary of statements is to move the Magistrate to consider

placing the suspect in remand custody, he must place before the Magistrate

sufficient material to substantiate the allegation contained in the report that

the suspect has committed one or more offences. (emphasis added)

The report P3 names the four Petitioners as suspects and was signed by the 1st

Respondent. However, it does not refer to any provision in the Penal Code or any penal

provision in any other law. If the Petitioners did degrade and condescend Buddhism as

alleged, those acts will fall within one of the offences set out in Chapter XV of the Penal

Code. The failure on the part of the 1st Respondent to specify such an offence in P3

impinges on spontaneity and his version must be rejected.

Moreover, the Police confiscated the leaflets that were in the custody of the

Petitioners. However, none of them were tendered to Court along with the affidavit of

the 1st Respondent. There was no impediment to do so, given that they were not

productions before the Magistrate.

Page 20 of 32

In the circumstances, I am inclined to make an adverse inference against the 1st

Respondent for failing to produce important evidence that is relevant in ascertaining

whether the Petitioners did degrade and condescend Buddhism.

In any event, the Petitioners were discharged on the very next date 17.11.2014 on the

application of the Police after completion of investigations. That could not have

happened had the Petitioners actually did degrade and condescend Buddhism.

There is also no material to conclude of an imminent threat of breach of peace which

justified the arrest of the Petitioners as asserted by the 1st Respondent. No such

statement is made in P3. In fact, Police had informed the Magistrate on the same day

the incident took place i.e. 29.10.2014 that there is no evidence of any breach of peace.

In the report P3, the 1st Respondent has given two further reasons for the arrest of the

four Petitioners. They are:

(1) Propagation of Christianity by using force.

(2) Investigate whether they were involved in the commission of any offence.

In Christian Sahanaye Doratuwa Prayer Centre (Incorporation) (Private Members

Bill) (2001) [Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (1991-2003), Vol.

VII, page 239 at 243], it was held that our Constitution does not guarantee a

fundamental right to propagate religion as in Article 25(1) of the Indian Constitution.

Here propagate was used in the sense of the right to convert any person to ones own

religion. The justification rested on Article 10 itself which guarantees to every person

that the basic choice he makes with regard to his religion or belief would be taken with

complete freedom without being exposed to any undue influence, allurement or fraud.

This rationale was quoted with approval in New Wine Harvest Ministries

(Incorporation) Bill (2003)[Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills

(1991-2003), Vol. VII, page 363].

Page 21 of 32

In Karuwalagaswewa Vidanelage Swarna Manjula [supra. at pages 36-37], Prasanna

Jayawardena, P.C., J. after an exhaustive analysis held that our Constitution does not

confer the right to propagate religion. He used to propagate in the sense of

spreading ones religion.

I am in respectful agreement with this reasoning and conclusion. In fact, the

recognition of the right to choose a religion of ones choice without any external

influence is found in Article 18(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political

Rights which states that No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his

freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.

Nevertheless, propagation in the sense of the right to convert any person to ones own

religion or in the sense of spreading ones religion is not an offence as the law stands

now.

I am mindful that the Report of the Presidential Commission on Buddha Sasana (2002)

dealt with unethical conversions in Chapter 9 of its report. It identifies the background

of a long-standing problem of unethical conversions and recommendation No. 12.83

recommended enacting legislation to prohibit unethical conversions and to criminalise

such conversions.

There was an attempt in 2004 to provide for the prohibition of conversion from one

religion to another by use of force or allurement or by fraudulent means and to make

such acts penal offences. For this purpose, a Bill titled Prohibition of Forcible

Conversion of Religion Bill was tabled in Parliament in July 2004. The constitutionality

of the Bill was challenged. In Prohibition of Forcible Conversion of Religion Bill (2004)

[Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills (2004-2006), Vol. VIII, page

16], Court found that certain clauses of the Bill violate Articles 10 and 12(1) of the

Constitution. Several recommendations were made to make the Bill constitutional.

After the Second reading in Parliament, the Bill was referred to the legislative Standing

Committee on 06.05.2005. The Report of this Committee was made available on

06.01.2009. The Bill was not proceeded with.

Page 22 of 32

Accordingly, even assuming without conceding that the Petitioners did attempt to

forcibly convert people to Christianity as alleged by the 1st Respondent, it is not an

offence as the law stands now. Therefore, it cannot form the basis for any lawful arrest

of the Petitioners.

Let me consider the other ground relied on by the 1st Respondent to justify the arrest

of the Petitioners, namely to investigate whether they were involved in the commission

of any offence.

Section 32 of the Code specifies several instances where any Police Officer may without

an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant arrest any person. None of these

sub-sections empowers a Police Officer to arrest a person hoping to find evidence of

the commission of any offence through a subsequent investigation. Even if the 1st

Respondent had found such evidence through a subsequent investigation, the arrest is

illegal.

In Piyasiri and Others v. Nimal Fernando and Others [(1988) 1 Sri L.R. 173 at 184] it

was held that:

No Police Officer has the right to arrest a person on a vague and general

suspicion, not knowing the precise crime suspected but hoping to obtain

evidence of the commission of some crime for which they have the power to

arrest. Even if such evidence comes to light the arrest will be illegal because

there will have been no proper communication of the reason for the: arrest to

the accused at the time of the arrest. (emphasis added)

These observations resonate with the facts of the present case. In P3 the 1st

Respondent, in requesting that the Petitioners be detained in custody until it was

clarified if the Petitioners were involved in any offence or not, stated to Court:

Page 23 of 32

2014.11.03

.

There is no such procedure in law. No one can be deprived of the right to liberty

pending an investigation into whether they have committed an offence.

It is clear that the real reason for the arrest of the Petitioners was their door-to-door

ministry and the allegations of degrading Buddhism and concern over house robberies

and thefts is an afterthought. In all the statements received by the Police, the focal

point has been on the Petitioners ministry. The document 1R4, which contains an

uncannily consistent series of complaints made by the villagers, indicates that the

villagers were upset of the Petitioners door-to-door visits. None of the statements

show, other than that the Petitioners were unknown to the villagers, that there was a

reason to believe that the Petitioners could have committed the offences of robbery

or theft.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioners fundamental rights

guaranteed by Article 13 (1) of the Constitution has been infringed by the actions of

the 1st Respondent.

Articles 12 (1) and 12 (2)

Petitioners submitted that the Respondents had a duty to protect them during the

commotion. It was stated that the Respondents failed in their duty to disperse the mob

which arose from the discriminatory actions on the part of the Respondents resulting

in the violation of Art. 12 (1) and 12 (2) of the Constitution.

The Petitioners allege that the 2nd Respondent Grama Niladhari acted in a malicious

manner and berated them for having visited Kirama in their ministry work. She had

allegedly stated that only Buddhists were welcome in the region.

Page 24 of 32

However, I am not convinced that the Petitioners have established any infringement by

the 2nd Respondent of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1) and 12(2)

of the Constitution.

According to Section 2 of the Code, both Police officers and Grama Niladharis are

considered to be a Peace officers appointed to perform police duties. Police duties

are stipulated in Section 56 of the Police Ordinance, which includes the duty;

(a) to use his best endeavours and ability to prevent all crimes, offences, and

public nuisances;

(b) to preserve the peace;

(c) to apprehend disorderly and suspicious characters;

(d) to detect and bring offenders to justice;

(e) to collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public peace; and

(f) promptly to obey and execute all orders and warrants lawfully issued and

directed to him by any competent authority.

It is clear that in the colour of office, the 2nd Respondent was required to prevent

offences, ensure that peace is maintained, apprehend persons who act in a disorderly

and suspicious manner and bring offenders to justice.

In her affidavit dated 01.07.2016, the 2nd Respondent claims that she saw a large

gathering near Waldehigaha junction and that she attempted to identify the Petitioners

by requesting their national identity cards. The 2nd Respondent was acting well within

her powers in making this request. The Petitioners admit that the 2nd Respondent had

identified herself as the Grama Niladhari of the area. They should have complied with

her request. The refusal by the Petitioners to comply was unlawful and contributed to

the escalation of the situation. Admittedly they produced their national identity cards

only after the arrival of the 1st Respondent.

Page 25 of 32

I am also of the view that the version of the incident presented by the Petitioners in

the pleadings appears to have been at times deliberately altered to cast the events in

a more favourable light, seemingly with the intention of impressing the Court. Such

modifications suggest a calculated effort to influence the Courts perception, rather

than provide a wholly accurate and transparent account of what transpired.

For example, it is claimed that the 1st Respondent had berated the Petitioners for

coming to the Kirama area to allegedly spread the Petitioners religion for financial

gain. However, according to the affidavit tendered by the 1st Respondent, he himself

is avowedly a Christian. It is inconceivable that he would resort to the impugned acts.

I hold that the Petitioners have failed to establish any infringement by the 2nd

Respondent of their fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 12(1) or 12(2).

As more fully explained above, the arrest of the Petitioners by the 1st Respondent was

not made in accordance with law. One of the fundamental principles enshrined in

Article 12(1) is that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal

protection of the law. Moreover, it postulates that all actions must be in accordance

with the law. The 1st Respondent infringed the fundamental rights of the Petitioners

guaranteed by Article 12(1) in arresting them contrary to law.

It is also clear to me that the Petitioners were subjected to this discriminatory

treatment based on their religious affiliation.

In W. P. S. Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Others [S. C. (F. R.) Application

No. 265/2017, S. C. M. 11.12.2020 at page 15] my learned brother Kodagoda, P.C., J.

held that:

A pre-condition for the maintenance of peaceful co-existence of any plural society,

sustainable peace, cohesiveness between different communities, and achieving

prosperity, is the conferment of the right to equality to all persons of such society.

Page 26 of 32

Regardless of what opinions or beliefs people hold, no person should be discriminated

on the basis of their race, religion, language, caste, sex, political opinion, place of birth

or any one of such grounds. State officials functioning under the colour of their office

are especially obligated to take a non-discriminatory approach. This must be a basic

requirement expected of all public officials, particularly those within the Police force.

In Yick Wo v. Hopkins [(1886) 118 U.S. 356 at 373-374] the US Supreme Court held

that:

[t]hough the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it

is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal

hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between

persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal

justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the 1st Respondent has infringed the fundamental

rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under Article 12 (2) of the Constitution.

Article 14 (1) (e)

Article 14 (1) (e) reads as follows:

14. (1) Every citizen is entitled to

(e) the freedom, either by himself or in association with others, and either

in public or in private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship,

observance, practice and teaching; [] (emphasis added)

It is clear that Article 14 (1)(e) covers the external manifestation of a citizens religion

or belief. However, it does not extend to every form of manifestation. It secures only

the manifestation, in public or private, through worship, observance, practice

and teaching. The issue for determination is whether propagation of the religion of

the Petitioners which they were involved in on the day of the incident falls within one

or more of these modes of external manifestation of their religion or belief.

Page 27 of 32

In Karuwalagaswewa Vidanelage Swarna Manjula [supra], Prasanna Jayawardena,

P.C., J. after a comprehensive analysis of the four modes of manifestation held that

propagation of religion does not fall within either worship, observance, practice

or teaching.

In arriving at this conclusion, his Lordship held (at page 31) that:

The meaning of the words worship and observance in relation to a religion

or set of beliefs, are well known. For purposes of completeness, the Shorter

Oxford Dictionary [5th ed.] defines worship as meaning Honour or adore as

divine or sacred, esp. with religious rites or ceremonies; offer prayer or prayers

to (a god) and defines observance as meaning an act performed in

accordance with prescribed usage, esp. one of religious or ceremonial character;

a customary rite or ceremony..

As for practice, his Lordship concluded (at pages 31-32) that:

[] practice which features in Article 14(1)(e), the Shorter Oxford Dictionary

defines the word as meaning The habitual doing or carrying out of something;

usual or customary action or performance. I am inclined to consider that, the

fact that the word practice is placed in Article 14(1)(e) together with and

following from the words worship and observance, suggests that, the word

practice is used in Article 14(1)(e) to mean and refer to a customary or

traditional ritual, ceremony or act which is performed in the course of or allied

to or consequent to acts of worship and observance of a religion or a set of

beliefs. This conclusion is warranted by the maxim noscitur a sociis which

postulates that, in matters of statutory interpretation, the coupling of words

which have analogous meanings suggests that they should be understood to be

used in their cognate sense and that their colour is to be taken from each other

- vide: Maxwells `The Interpretation of Statutes [12th ed. at p.289] and

Brooms `Legal Maxims [10th ed. at p. 396]. As a result, I am of the view that,

the word practice is used in Article 14(1)(e) to mean and refer to a customary

Page 28 of 32

or traditional ritual, ceremony or act which is performed in the course of or allied

to or consequent to acts of worship and observance of a religion or a set of

beliefs.

In interpreting teaching, his Lordship explained (at page 34) that:

[t]he act of teaching involves a process of the education of a student [or

group of students] by a teacher who, by means of instructions, lessons and

training, imparts knowledge and skills to the student [or students]. The resulting

process of teaching is usually consensual since, on the one hand, the teacher

voluntarily agrees to perform the duty of teaching and, on the other hand, the

student voluntarily seeks the teacher because he wishes to learn from the

teacher. The act of teaching is usually pre-arranged and entered into with

deliberation and for the individual benefit of both the teacher and the student.

It usually takes place at a pre-determined place which is known to and

convenient to both teacher and student. Usually, the identity of both the teacher

and the student are known to each other or their agents, before the act of

teaching commences. No doubt, there will be instances where the act of

teaching occurs spontaneously, as for example where an elder teaches a child

or a friend teaches another friend. However, in general, it can be fairly said that,

the act of teaching is usually pre-arranged and consensual. Further, the act of

teaching usually involves a personal relationship between the teacher and the

student.

I think it must be added that teaching is fundamentally directed towards educating a

person on a particular subject. Spread of a religion involves much more. It involves in

convincing a person of the truth and benefits of the religion with a view to convincing

him to embrace such religion.

Subject to this observation, I have closely examined the process of reasoning adopted

and find no compelling reason to deviate or disagree with the process or its

conclusions. The Petitioners were on the day of the incident engaged in the

Page 29 of 32

propagation of their religion. They did not go to meet any persons or persons on

invitation. They sought to randomly indulge in their ministry work. There was no

consensual element. The activity of the Petitioners does not fall within does not fall

within either worship, observance, practice or teaching in Article 14(1)(e).

I hold that the fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed by Article 14(1)(e) has

not been infringed.

Article 14 (1) (a)

Petitioners submit that the Respondents by their actions in arresting the Petitioners

and confiscating their religious literature restricted the Petitioners freedom of

expression beyond any permissible scope prescribed by the Constitution in violation of

Article 14 (1) (a).

Article 14 (1) (a) states that:

14. (1) Every citizen is entitled to (a) the freedom of speech and expression

including publication; []

This right is not an absolute one. Article 15 (2) and (7) specifies certain restrictions over

the freedom of speech and expression. In the case of Joseph Perera alias Bruten

Perera v. Attorney General and Others [(1992) 1 Sri L.R. 199 at 200-201], it was held

that:

Freedom of speech by Article 14(1)(a) goes to the heart of the natural rights

of an organised freedom loving society to impart and acquire information. Of

that freedom one may say that it is the matrix, the indispensable condition of

nearly every other freedom. This freedom is not absolute. There is no such thing

as absolute and unrestricted freedom of speech and expression, wholly free

from restraint [] On similar lines, there are provisions in our Constitution.

Article 15(2) provides that the exercise and operation of the right of freedom

of speech and expression shall be subject to such restrictions as may be

prescribed by law in the interests of racial and religious harmony or in relation

Page 30 of 32

to parliamentary privilege, contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an

offence. Article 15(7) further provides that "the exercise and operation of all

the fundamental rights declared and recognised by Articles 12, 13(1), 13(2) and

14 shall be subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed by law in the

interests of national security, public order and the protection of public health

or morality or for the purpose of the due recognition and respect of the rights

and freedoms of others or of meeting the just requirements of the general

welfare of a democratic society.

Nevertheless, the Petitioners were not exercising their freedom of speech and

expression including publication. They were involved in the external manifestation of

their religion or belief. While Article 10 recognises the fundamental freedom to have

or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, it is only Article 14(1)(e) which ensures the

fundamental freedom for its external manifestation. However, the Constitution

recognises only four modes of such external manifestation in Article 14(1)(e) which

must be read as containing an exhaustive exposition of the external manifestation of

ones religion or belief. What does not fall within Article 14(1)(e) as part of an external

manifestation of ones religion or belief cannot be brought within Article 14(1)(a) under

the guise of freedom of speech and expression including publication.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that there has been no infringement of the

fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the

Constitution.

To summarise, the 1st Respondent has infringed the fundamental rights of the

Petitioners guaranteed by Articles 12(1), 12(2) and 13(1) of the Constitution.

The 1st Respondent is directed to pay Rs. 50,000/= to each Petitioner. Additionally, the

State is directed to pay Rs. 25,000/= to each Petitioner.

Page 31 of 32

Before parting with this judgment, I wish to set out my thoughts on the unfortunate

circumstances leading to these applications. Religious tolerance is a cornerstone of

harmonious coexistence in diverse societies. It entails respecting and accepting the

beliefs, practices, and traditions of individuals and communities, regardless of their

faith or religion. By fostering an environment of religious tolerance, we promote

understanding, empathy, and peaceful interaction among people of different religious

backgrounds. This not only strengthens social cohesion but also upholds the

fundamental human right to freedom of religion or belief.

Religion should not be viewed as a divisive force. There are certain common

fundamental philosophies that are found in all major religions in the world. Religion

can thus be a uniting force in promoting spiritual upliftment and social cohesion and

cohabitation based upon common values.

It must be borne in mind that certain features in our national flag symbolises the

multifaceted Sri Lankan society. The four bo leaves represent Buddhisms four virtues

(Brahmavihara or apramana) of kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. These

virtues have an important role in creating empathy amongst different ethnic, religious

and cultural groups. Otherwise, the national flag will remain a mere symbol than a

living symbol of a multi ethnic, multi religious and multi-cultural country.

Embracing religious tolerance enriches our communities, promotes mutual respect,

and paves the way for a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone can

observe, worship, practice and teach their faith without fear of discrimination or

persecution.

In conclusion, I am constrained to refer to the advice given by Lord Buddha to the 60

monks on Il Full Moon Poya Day after delivering his first sermon, the

Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya 56.11), which means "The Setting in

Motion of the Wheel of Dharma."

Page 32 of 32

Thereafter Lord Buddha addressed the 60 Arahaths and said:

"Charatha Bhikkave Charikan, Bahujana Hithaya, Bahujana Sukhaya,

Lokanukampaya Attaya Hitaya Sukhaya Devamanussanan Ma Ekena Deva

Agamitta Desetha Bhikkave Dhamman Adikalyanam Pariyosana, Kalyanan

Satthan Sakyanjanan Kevala Paripunnan Parisuddan Brahamachariyan

Pakasetha."

(Oh! Bhikkus for the Welfare of the many, for the Happiness of the many,

through Compassion to the World, Go Ye Forth, and spread the Doctrine of

Buddha Dhamma for the benefit of Devas and Human Beings)

Buddhism became a universal religion through the spread of dhamma by its disciples.

The world may not have the benefit of the teachings of Lord Buddha had the followers

of other religions responded the same way in which the villagers and Police responded

to the conduct of the Petitioners.
