K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J

1. The Petitioner is the owner of the property described in the schedule to

the deed of transfer No. 5384 dated 21/01/2013 which was attested by

Notary Public D.W. Witharana. This land is depicted as Lot 12 in the

preliminary plan prepared by the Surveyor General on 04/08/1978

bearing No. 1384 (marked P - 8). Lot 09 of the said plan is owned by the

3rd Respondent and was reserved as a common well. Further, the land in

the Eastern boundary of the Petitioner’s land belongs to the 9th

Respondent. The 3rd Respondent, following the allocation of the funds by

the Ministry of Economic Development and consultations with relevant

stakeholders has decided to construct a community hall in the

aforementioned Lot 09 which was previously reserved for a well. It is her

position that the fundamental rights guaranteed to her by Article 12 (1)

of the Constitution are in violation owing to the construction of the

aforementioned community hall by the 3rd Respondent in Lot 09 of

preliminary plan bearing No. 1384. This Court granted leave to proceed

under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution against the 1st -9th Respondents.

Petitioner’s Version

2. The Petitioner’s land depicted as Lot 12 in the preliminary plan prepared

by the Surveyor General on 04/08/1978 bearing No. 1384, is situated

within the Municipal Council limits of Galle and she states that as per S.

3(1) of the Urban Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978, the Galle

Municipal Council is a declared urban development area.

3. According to the Petitioner, a 4.0 perch land (Lot 9) in the aforementioned

plan bearing No. 1384 – the northern boundary of the Petitioner’s land is

a reservation for a common well. However, with the lapse of time, the well

4

was abandoned and following a letter from the medical officer of the

Municipal Council dated 12/01/1999, steps have been taken to fill the

said well.

4. According to the Petitioner, the 9th Respondent has constructed a house

at a higher elevation in the eastern boundary of the Petitioner’s land

allegedly with the approval of the municipal council.

5. Aa result of this construction, water from the premises now flows down

the vertical slope, leading to soil erosion, rocks being washed away, and

large boulders becoming loose. This has caused the slope to become

unstable and, according to the Petitioner, has created serious danger to

the lives of her family members and to her property.

6. The Petitioner states that by letter dated 03/07/2009, her mother

requested the 6th Respondent to look into the aforementioned issue. The

6th Respondent has then by letter dated 18/08/2009 informed the 4th

Respondent the following:

• That the rear of the Petitioner’s house is a slope consisting of

boulders

• The boundary stones have been destroyed up to the fence and are

a danger.

• There is a threat of landslide owing to the flowing of the

accumulated rain water from the 9th Respondent’s premises.

7. According to the Petitioner, requests have been made to the 4th, 5th, and

7th Respondents to create a solid framework to solve the above issue

owing to the danger caused to the Petitioner’s family.

8. In February 2012, the 5th Respondent has informed the Petitioner that

the planning committee had decided to summon the involved parties.

Later that month, the committee’s decisions were communicated to the

Petitioner’s mother and the 9th Respondent, along with a report from the

5

National Building Research Organization highlighting geological

instability around the Petitioner’s house. Based on this, the 9th

Respondent was instructed to prevent rainwater from flowing down to the

lower plateau and to obtain proper approval for construction, which had

been carried out contrary to the approved plan. She states that this issue

remains unsolved.

9. She further states that on 24/09/2014, she had noticed the

commencement of some construction work in the plot of land (Lot. 09)

that was previously reserved for a well. She states that upon inquiring

from the 2nd Respondent she has learned that a two-story community hall

is being constructed in Lot 9 by the 3rd Respondent. She states that she

objected to this construction because the excavation in process was

contrary to a report submitted by the National Building Research

Organization. She states that she made a complaint to the Galle Police

Station to inquire into this matter on 25/09/2014. She has further

written letters dated 01/10/2014 to the 1st, 4th, 6th, 7th Respondents and

to the Mayor of the 3rd Respondent Municipal Council denoting the

danger to her life associated with the above construction and to therefore

investigate into the matter.

10. She states that amidst the complaints made to the various authorities,

construction was continuing and that when her husband inquired into

the same on 16/10/2014, the 1st Respondent has allegedly threatened

her husband.

11. Afterwards, she states that in response to her letter dated 01/10/2014,

via a letter dated 18/10/2014 the 6th Respondent has informed that the

planning committee of the 3rd Respondent (the Municipal Council) has

granted approval for the above mentioned construction and that the

National Building Research Organization has made conditional

recommendations in respect of the land and that plan has been approved

subject to the same. The letter further stated that the aforesaid

6

construction work is carried out by the 3rd Respondent and that the

building in question is a public building.

12. She submits that construction work continued on and that she and her

husband made several complaints to the Galle Police Station against the

above mentioned construction. Statements of the Petitioner and her

husband have been recorded by the Police 17/11/2014.

13. The Petitioner further states that on 29/12/2014 the construction crew

dug a latrine which is about 4 feet wide and 4- 5 feet deep. She states

that this exacerbates the threat of landslide and thereby endangers her

life and property.

14. Therefore, she states that the construction of the community hall is

contrary to the recommendations of the National Building Research

Organization (marked P-16) and that it is contrary to Regulation 17 of the

Urban Development Authority Planning and Building Regulations, 1986

as amended from time to time. She alleges that there has been a failure

to properly investigate into the complaints made by the Petitioner in this

regard. Further, she states that the extent of land in Lot 9 is not sufficient

to meet all the needs of a community hall and that there is no necessity

for such a building. For these reasons, she alleges that the fundamental

rights guaranteed to her under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution have been

violated.

The Respondent’s Version

15. In response, the 1st Respondent in his affidavit states that all necessary

approvals from the relevant authorities have been obtained for the

construction of the community hall under the purview of the Divisional

Secretariat, Four Gravets, Galle as the Planning Committee of the 3rd

Respondent at a meeting held on 02.09.2014 approved the construction.

7

He further states that the decision to build a community hall was in

response to the needs and well-being of the community.

16. He further states that the report by the National Building Research

Organization dated 21.05.2015 numbered NBRO/LRRMD/CO/15/31/

17482 does not indicate that the construction of the community hall has

caused or increased the threat of a rockslide/ landslide or any

environmental harm to the Petitioner’s property.

17. The 4th and 5th Respondents in their affidavits take up a preliminary

objection that the application is time barred. Further, they state that the

vertical slope which the Petitioner claims to be a threat to her property is

located in the eastern boundary of her land and that the community hall

is located in the western boundary. They submit that the community hall

and the Petitioner’s house are in the same elevation.

18. They further submit that the Petitioner has hidden material facts from

the Court as they state that she and her mother in 2008 blasted several

rocks situated in the said slope without any prior approval. It is submitted

that by letter dated 09.09.2014 the 5th Respondent directed the Petitioner

to stop the unauthorized blasting owing to the environmental threat it

posed.

19. In relation to the dispute between the Petitioner and the 9th Respondent

who occupies the land in the eastern boundary, the 4th and 5th

Respondents state that the 3rd Respondent summoned both parties before

the planning committee and directed the 9th Respondent to comply with

the directions stated in the report by the National Building Research

Organization (marked P-15).

20. They further state that the recommendations made by the National

Building Research Bureau (marked P-16) only relates to the eastern

boundary of the Petitioner’s land and therefore has no relevance to the

8

boundary between Petitioner’s land and Lot 9 of the preliminary plan

where the community hall is being constructed. In response to the

contention vis-à-vis Regulation 17 of Urban Development Authority

Planning and Building Regulations, 1986 (as amended), they submit that

by way of Regulation 17 (3) the 6th Respondent and or the 3rd Respondent

are empowered relax the requirements mandated by Regulation 17

provided all the other requirements are met.

21. They state that when the 1st Respondent sought for permission to

construct a community hall, the 3rd Respondent sought

recommendations from the National Building Research Organization

where they recommended the aforesaid construction subject to certain

conditions. They also submit that these conditions were duly

communicated to the 1st Respondent in granting permission for the

aforementioned construction. Therefore, they maintain that the

construction of the community hall does not affect the Petitioner’s

property.

Alleged Violation of Fundamental Rights

• The Preliminary Objection

22. I will first address the preliminary objection that was raised by the 4th

and 5th Respondents that present application is out of time. In the

circumstances of this matter, I am of the opinion that owing to the

continuous nature of the constructions and the complaints made to the

Human Rights Commission (marked P-35), the issue may be understood

as an alleged continuing violation, whereby the application would not be

deemed as filed out of time. I will therefore move on the address the merits

of the matter.

9

• Alleged Violation of Article 12 (1)

23. Article 12(1) of the Constitution provides:

“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the

equal protection of the law.”

24. Looking at the jurisprudential development vis-à-vis Article 12 (1) of the

Constitution in Palihawadana v. Attorney General & Others (1978-

79-80) 1 Sri LR 65 at page 68 Shravananda J. comprehensively

interprets Article 12 (1) as follows:

“…Article 12 of the Constitution lays down the general rule of

equality that all persons are equal before the law and are entitled

to equal protection of the law and that no citizen shall be

discriminated against on grounds of race, religion, language, caste,

sex, political opinion, place of birth or any of such grounds.”

25. In the case at hand, the Petitioner states that the construction of the

aforementioned Community Hall is in conflict due to two reasons

primarily. Firstly, that it is against Regulation 17 of the Urban

Development Authority Planning and Building Regulations, 1986 as

amended and secondly, that it is not in compliance with the

recommendations of the National Building Research Organization.

26. With regards to the first position, Regulation 17 of the Urban

Development Authority Planning and Building Regulations, 1986 (as

amended) states the following:

“(1) the minimum extent and the minimum width of lots for different

classes buildings, not being high-rise buildings, should be in

conformity with the specification set out in Form “C” of Schedule

(III) unless the authority has stipulated a higher or lower minimum

10

extent and/or higher or lower width of lots in a development plan

approved for the area or proposed for the area.”

27. In this regard, the Petitioner states that the construction of the

community hall is in contradiction of these requirements. However, the

4th and 5th Respondents in their affidavits submit that the 3rd and or 6th

Respondents are empowered to relax the aforementioned requirements

under Regulation 17 (3) of the Urban Development Authority Planning

and Building Regulations, 1986 (as amended). It states the following:

“(3) The authority may relax requirements of the specified site,

extent and width in the case of an existing lot provided that a

building stratifying the other regulations can built on the site.”

28. The 4th and 5th Respondents further submit that in exercising the

aforementioned discretion, the following were considered by the 3rd

Respondent. Therefore, they submit that the date on which the lot was

subdivided was considered by the 3rd Respondent as most of the

regulations contained in the Urban Development Authority Planning and

Building Regulations, 1986 (as amended) do not relate to lands

subdivided prior to the implementation of it. In this regard, as the plan

bearing No 1348 was prepared in 1977 and the aforementioned

Regulations came into power in 1986, it is their position that Lot 9 of plan

bearing No 1348 should be considered an existed land. For these reasons

they claim a lenient interpretation of Regulation 17 of the Urban

Development Authority Planning and Building Regulations, 1986 (as

amended) should be given in implementing Regulation 17 in the case at

hand.

29. Upon considering the submissions of all parties, I am of the opinion

that the 3rd Respondent is entitled to exercise the discretion granted by

way of Regulation 17 (3) of the Urban Development Authority Planning

11

and Building Regulations, 1986 (as amended) and therefore that the

construction is not outlawed.

30. Regarding the second position furthered by the Petitioner, that it is not

in compliance with the recommendations of the National Building

Research Organization to build the community hall, the Petitioner

forwards documents marked P – 11 and P – 16. The 4th and 5th

Respondents state that these documents relate to the Eastern boundary

and that they are therefore irrelevant to the construction of the

community hall.

31. Upon perusal of the documents marked P – 11 and P -16, I am in

agreement with the position taken by the 4th and 5th Respondents, the

recommendations relate to the boundary between the Petitioner’s

property and that of the 9th Respondent.

32. I further observe that the 3rd Respondent has sought recommendations

from the National Building Research Organization where they

recommended the construction of the community hall subject to certain

conditions. They also submit that these conditions were duly

communicated to the 1st Respondent in granting permission for the

aforementioned construction. The report provided by the National

Building Research Organization marked “4-R-2” notes that there is no

such danger as well. Whereby I am of the opinion that the second position

furthered by the Petitioner too cannot be accepted.

33. For these reasons I am unable to find any material to establish that the

Petitioner was subject to arbitrary, discriminatory or unequal treatment

under the law as there is no material to conclude such treatment.

12

• The dispute between the Petitioner and the 9th Respondent

34. While the issue at hand is separate to the dispute between the Petitioner

and the 9th Respondent, the Attorney-at-Law for the 9th Respondent, Dr.

Sunil Cooray submitted that the 9th Respondent is willing to implement

the recommendations (i), (ii), and (iii) mentioned in the report by the

National Building Research Organization dated 21.05.2015 numbered

NBRO/LRRMD/CO/15/31/ 17482.

35. In the above premise, I declare that the fundamental rights that have

been guaranteed to the petitioner under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution

has not been violated.

Application is Dismissed.
