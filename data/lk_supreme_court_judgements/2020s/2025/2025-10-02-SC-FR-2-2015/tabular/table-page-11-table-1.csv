"and  Building  Regulations,  1986  (as  amended)  and  therefore  that  the"
"construction is not outlawed."
"30.  Regarding the second position furthered by the Petitioner, that it is not"
"in  compliance  with 
the  recommendations  of 
the  National  Building"
"Research  Organization 
to  build 
the  community  hall, 
the  Petitioner"
"forwards  documents  marked  P  –  11  and  P  –  16.  The  4th  and  5th"
"Respondents state that these documents relate to the Eastern boundary"
"and 
that 
they  are 
therefore 
irrelevant 
to 
the  construction  of 
the"
"community hall."
"31.  Upon  perusal  of  the  documents  marked  P  –  11  and  P  -16,  I  am  in"
"agreement  with  the  position  taken  by  the  4th  and  5th  Respondents,  the"
"recommendations 
relate 
to 
the  boundary  between 
the  Petitioner’s"
"property and that of the 9th Respondent."
"32. 
I further observe that the 3rd Respondent has sought recommendations"
"from 
the 
National 
Building 
Research  Organization  where 
they"
"recommended the construction of the community hall subject to certain"
"conditions. 
They 
also 
submit 
that 
these 
conditions  were 
duly"
"communicated  to  the  1st  Respondent  in  granting  permission  for  the"
"aforementioned  construction.  The 
report  provided  by 
the  National"
"Building  Research  Organization  marked  “4-R-2”  notes  that  there  is  no"
"such danger as well. Whereby I am of the opinion that the second position"
"furthered by the Petitioner too cannot be accepted."
"33.  For these reasons I am unable to find any material to establish that the"
"Petitioner was subject to arbitrary, discriminatory or unequal treatment"
"under the law as there is no material to conclude such treatment."
