The plaintiff-appellant-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)

preferred this appeal on the basis of being dissatisfied of the judgment dated

27-05-2016 pronounced by the Court of Appeal, wherein, the appeal preferred

by him challenging the judgment pronounced by the District Court of

Gampaha in Case No. 33206/L was dismissed.

When this matter was supported for Leave to Appeal, this Court granted leave

on 03-04-2017, based on the following questions of law.

1. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by taking the view that a tenant

can never contract out of the protection afforded by the Rent Act on

the basis of the judgment in Hussain Vs. Jiffry (2002) 1 Sri L R

page 185, in which the tenant had resumed payments to the

landlord.

2. Has the Court of Appeal erred in law by its failure to consider that

the plaintiff had forgone the rent in respect of the building at issue

and that the defendant could retain the tenancy in respect of the

other buildings in terms of settlements reached by the parties in

determination of the issue whether a tenant can contract outside the

Rent Act.

3. Was the Court of Appeal in error by not taking cognisance that the

defendant was not prohibited from renouncing his tenancy in terms

of the provisions of the Rent Act.

4. Did the both Courts err in law by not appreciating that the contract

of tenancy between the parties had come to an end upon the entry

of the settlement by which the primary obligation of the tenant to

pay rent was dispensed with.

5. Have both the Courts erred in law by appreciating that, in view of

the cessation of the payment of rent by mutual consent with the

undertaking to deliver the possession to the landlord on a fixed date,

has brought about the termination of tenancy and created a contract

of license.

This is a matter where the appellant has filed an action against the now

deceased-defendant of the District Court action, seeking for a declaration of

title to the land morefully described in the schedule of the plaint and also for

an order to evict the original defendant and anyone who claims under him

from the land mentioned in the schedule.

Although, the action has been instituted in the form of an action for

declaration of title and ejectment, there had been no dispute at the trial that

in fact, the appellant was the landlord of the original defendant, and the

defendant, being the tenant, had the protection of the provisions of the Rent

Act No. 07 of 1972. There has also been no dispute that the original defendant

has made an application to the Rent Board of Veyangoda on the basis that

his landlord refuses to accept rent from him, and therefore, for suitable orders

in that regard.

Though the original defendant has filed the earlier mentioned application

against the father of the appellant, when the matter was taken up before the

Rent Board, the original defendant has agreed to accept the appellant as his

landlord.

When the Rent Board application was taken up for hearing on 26-09-1989,

the original defendant being the applicant of that application has entered into

a settlement with the appellant whom he has recognized as his landlord. The

said settlement reflects in the document marked P-03 and also produced as

V-02 by the parties during the District Court trial.

In the settlement, which has been recorded before the members of the Rent

Board and signed by all the relevant parties, the original defendant has agreed

to renounce his tenancy in relation to the building where a bakery is situated,

in the land as shown in the schedule of the plaint.

He has also agreed to handover the possession of the same, on or before 30-

04-1990, and to remove all the goods belonging to him by that date. It has

also been agreed by the appellant as the landlord, to allow the tenant to use

the toilet situated in the land or else, to put up a new toilet near the shop

owned by the tenant at his expense. It has been agreed further that the

Page 6 of 10

landlord will not charge any rent until the date agreed by the tenant to vacate

the premises.

The action instituted before the District Court bears testimony that the

original defendant has failed to abide by the settlement and has continued to

occupy the building, which is the subject matter of this action. This has

resulted in the appellant seeking relief from the District Court as mentioned

earlier.

At the trial, the original defendant has taken up the position that since the

appellant did not honour his promise to put up a separate toilet for him and

also, since he did not wish to renounce his tenancy, he continued to occupy

the subject matter.

The learned District Judge of Gampaha, of his judgment dated 29-07-1998,

has determined that under the applicable provisions of the Rent Act No. 07 of

1972, the agreement entered between the parties for the tenant to vacate the

premises cannot be enforced as a valid agreement since the alleged agreement

has been contracted outside the provisions of the Rent Act.

Accordingly, it has been determined that the original defendant is entitled to

claim the protection of the Rent Act. Accordingly, the action instituted by the

appellant has been dismissed on that basis.

When this judgment was appealed against to the Court of Appeal, the Court

of Appeal also held the same view. Having considered several decided cases of

our Superior Courts, it has been determined that the original defendant, being

the lawful tenant of the premises subjected to this action, cannot be ejected

on the basis of an agreement reached between the parties, since the tenant

has decided to not relinquish the protection afforded to him under the

provisions of the Rent Act. It has also been determined that the parties cannot

contract outside of the Rent Act, when the premises is governed by the

provisions of the Rent Act.

At the hearing of this appeal, it was agreed by both learned Counsel that

although several questions of law have been laid down to be determined, all

those questions revolve around whether the original defendant, being a tenant

Page 7 of 10

who had the protection of the Rent Act, can enter into an agreement in the

manner relied on by the appellant, and later refuse to abide by it, and claim

the same tenancy rights he enjoyed before entering into the said agreement.

It was the view of the learned Counsel who represented the appellant that

although the provisions of the Rent Act of 1972 have given strict protection to

a tenant who comes within the purview of the Act, in view of the Rent

(Amendment) Act No. 55 of 1980, where the legislature by its wisdom has

thought it fit to give a more liberal interpretation to the provisions of the Act,

an agreement entered in the nature of the agreement relied on by the

appellant to file an action against his tenant should be given the same liberal

interpretation and should give effect in order to give redress to a landlord.

He relied mainly on the Supreme Court judgment in Appuhamy Vs.

Seneviratne (1982) 2 SLR 601 to support his view.

However, the learned Counsel also admitted that the same view has not been

followed in the later judgments of the Supreme Court.

I find that for a landlord to eject a tenant where the standard rent does not

exceed Rs. 100/- as in this case, the procedure can only be in terms of section

22 of the Rent Act, where it clearly stipulates that notwithstanding anything

in any other law, no action or proceeding for the ejectment of the tenant of

any premises where the standard rent (determined under the section) of which

for a month does not exceed Rs.100/- shall be instituted or entertained by

any Court on the grounds other than stated therein.

It clearly appears that it is the very basis that their lordships of the Court of

Appeal upheld the judgment of the District Court.

The evidence led in this case clearly establishes the fact that the original

defendant, being the tenant who had the protection of the Rent Act, has gone

before the Rent Board because his landlord has refused to accept rent from

him.

Page 8 of 10

It has also not been disputed that the tenant has deposited the rent at the

relevant local government office as allowed by the Rent Act after he decided to

not abide by the agreement reached to vacate the premises.

The case of A.M.M. Ebrahim Saibo Vs. S.D.M. Mansoor 54 NLR 217 was an

appeal where the judgment was pronounced by a Five-Judge Bench of the

Supreme Court. Although this was a determination made under the terms of

the Rent Restriction Act No. 29 of 1948, I find the determination made at page

224 as to the manner in which the statutory protection guaranteed to a tenant

who falls under the provisions of the Act can come to an end, still valid in

terms of Rent Act No. 07 of 1972 as well, which is the presently applicable law

in that regard.

It was stated,

A tenant can never contract out of the protection afforded. It

follows from this that he can in any moment recall a promise to

surrender possession. The only two ways in which the statutory

protection comes to an end are:

1. By the handing back of the premises to the landlord.

2. By the order of a competent Court that is to say a Court

acting with jurisdiction.

It is the considered view of this Court that since the tenant has refused to

voluntarily handover the premises to the landlord, the only manner under

which he can be ejected from the premises would be under the provisions of

section 22 of the Rent Act, and not by coming before the District Court on the

basis of an agreement reached by the parties, where the tenant has agreed to

vacate, but refused to do so.

The case of Jayasinghe Vs. Arumugam (1992) 1 SLR 350 was a case

determined by the Supreme Court on similar facts where the tenant, after

giving a letter to the landlord stating that he will vacate the premises, failed

to do so. Having considered whether it amounts to a termination of the

tenancy in terms of the Rent Act,

Page 9 of 10

It was held: -

As the issue was whether in terms of the Rent Act No. 07 of 1972, a

letter given by the tenant that he would vacate the premises, the Roman

Dutch law would be irrelevant, section 22 does not set out as a ground

for ejectment the giving of a notice to quit by the tenant to his landlord.

Hence, the letter given by the tenant will not terminate the tenancy in

terms of the Act.

In the case of Hussain Vs. Jiffry (2002) 1 SLR 185, the matters considered

by Their lordships of the Supreme Court were similar to the above cited

judgment. The appellant was the landlord and the respondent was his tenant,

who had the protection of the provisions of the Rent Act. The respondent

informed the landlord in writing that he will be relinquishing his tenancy, but

later wrote another letter to the landlord informing that he will continue to be

his tenant. It has been established at the trial that the tenant has not handed

over the premises to the landlord.

Held:

1. In the circumstances, there was no termination of the tenancy and

the rule that a tenant cannot contract out of the protection afforded by

the Rent Act apply.

The decision relied on by the learned Counsel for the appellant, namely

Appuhamy Vs. Seneviratne (Supra), was a case where the landlord sought

a judgment to evict his tenant on the basis of arrears of rent and reasonable

requirement, which are grounds that can be urged in order to eject a tenant

from a house subject to the provisions of the Rent Act in terms of section 22

of the Act. The action has been initiated after serving the required notice on

the Commissioner of National Housing.

At the trial, the parties have come to a settlement where the tenant has agreed

to vacate the premises upon the terms and conditions agreed by the parties.

The learned District Judge has recorded the settlement and had entered the

decree, which in my view is a valid judgment entered by a competent Court.

Page 10 of 10

The tenant, after agreeing to the settlement before the District Court, filed an

appeal before the Court of Appeal not to challenge the settlement per se, but

on the basis that the learned District Judge had no jurisdiction to enter the

settlement without the Commissioner of National Housing providing him with

alternative accommodation.

I am of the view that it was in that context the Supreme Court has determined

the matter, holding that in such a scenario, it was open to the tenant to waive

the requirement and to agree to vacate the premises even before the

Commissioner was able to provide him with alternative accommodation,

which in my view is very much different to the facts of the matter under

appeal.

I am of the view that the learned District Judge as well as their lordships of

the Court of Appeal have come to correct findings in that regard which need

no disturbance from this Court.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the appeal, and answer

the questions of law raised in the negative.

Accordingly, I affirm the Judgment of the District Judge of Gampaha

pronounced on 29-07-1998 as well as the judgment pronounced by the Court

of Appeal on 27-05-2016.

The appeal is dismissed. The parties will bear their own costs.
