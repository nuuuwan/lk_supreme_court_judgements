"S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020"
"Respondent before  it  that the  Appellant  had  failed  to establish  before  the"
"said Court that the marriage between him and the Respondent is null and"
"void."
"When  the  Appellant  moved  the  Provincial  High  Court  against  the"
"said order by invoking its revisionary jurisdiction, the appellate Court also"
"accepted  the  validity  of  that  reasoning  and  added  that  it  was  for  him  to"
"establish that the marriage on which the claim of maintenance founded is a"
"nullity in  law. It further noted that the Magistrate’s Court did not inquire"
"into  the  question  which  of  the  two  marriages  is  valid.  Thereupon,  the"
"Provincial  High  Court  held  that,  if  the  material  indicates  that  there  is  a"
"valid marriage between the parties and the requisites of Section 2 or 11 of"
"the Maintenance Act are satisfied, it was the Magistrate’s responsibility to"
"make an order for an allowance of maintenance. The appellate Court also"
"noted  that  the  marriage  referred 
in  the  marriage  certificate  presented"
"before the Magistrate’s Court is accepted by both the parties."
"The  Appellant  thereupon  moved  the  Court  of  Appeal,  against  the"
"order  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  in  dismissing  his  application  made  in"
"terms  of  Article  138(1)  of  the  Constitution,  seeking  to  set  it  aside.  The"
"paragraph  13  of 
the  petition  dated  07.08.2009,  contains  some  of 
the"
"grounds averred by the Appellant in invoking the jurisdiction of the Court"
"of Appeal, which includes;"
"i. 
there is no right of appeal to the impugned order of the"
"Magistrate’s Court and therefor insisting on exceptional"
"circumstances 
by 
the 
Provincial  High 
Court 
is"
"erroneous,"
"32"
