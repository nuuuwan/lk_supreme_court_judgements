"S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020"
"Appellant over an interlocutory order made by that Court. If the intention"
"of  the  Appellant was  to frustrate  the  Respondent by  prolonging  the  legal"
"process in relation to the determination of maintenance, I must say that he"
"was  more  than  successful  in  that  endeavour.  However,  in  view  of  the"
"above  reasoning  and  of  the  answers  to  the  questions  of  law,  I  affirm  the"
"orders  made  by  the  Court  of  Appeal,  the  Provincial  High  Court  and  the"
"Magistrateâ€™s Court, that were considered in detail by this Court."
