"a  person  is  married  and wishes  to  marry  someone  else,  he  or  she"
"must obtain a decree of divorce or wait until the death of his or her"
"spouse. If the first marriage is void, it is technically not necessary to"

"normally  sought  to  avoid  any  uncertainty. In  cases  of  bigamy,  as"
"well  as  the  purported  marriage  being  void,  the  parties  may  have"
