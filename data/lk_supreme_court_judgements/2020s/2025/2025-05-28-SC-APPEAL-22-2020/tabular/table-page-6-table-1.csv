"S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020"
"with  the  application.  The  Respondent,  conceding  to  the  said  objection,"
"withdrew her application, reserving her right to file it afresh."
"On  03.11.2004, 
the  Respondent 
filed  her  second  application 
for"
"maintenance in Case No. 3828/03/04 and the Appellant once more raised"
"a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the said application on the"
"basis  that  the  male  child,  on  behalf  of  whom  the  Respondent  sought"
"maintenance is in fact an adult offspring. The Magistrate’s Court overruled"
"the objection on 14.12.2004 and ordered an interim allowance."
"The  Appellant  moved  the  Provincial  High  Court  in  revision  of  the"
"said  order  in  Case  No.  HCRA  717/04.  The  appellate    Court  by  its  order"
"dated 29.05.2006, set aside the impugned order and directed that only the"
"Respondent is entitled to continue with the application."
"On 28.08.2006, the Appellant raised another preliminary objection in"
"the  said  case  No.  3828/03/04  before  the  Magistrate’s  Court  but  this  time"
"on 
the  premise 
that 
the  Respondent  could  not  be  considered  as  his"
"“spouse”, 
in 
terms  of 
the  Maintenance  Act,  as  he  was  charged  and"
"convicted  to  have  committed  the  offence  of  bigamy  and  therefore  his"
"‘marriage’ contracted with the Respondent is a nullity."
"The Magistrate’s Court, by its order dated 12.02.2007, overruled the"
"said preliminary objection and proceeded to grant an interim allowance of"
"maintenance in favour of the Respondent."
"The  Appellant  thereupon 
invoked  revisionary 
jurisdiction  of  the"
"Provincial High Court against that order in Case No. HCRA 29/2007. After"
