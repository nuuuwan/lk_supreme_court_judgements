"S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020"
"made. In this regard the Certificate of Marriage indeed provides sufficient"
"undisputed proof of that fact."
"Since 
it 
is 
the  exclusive  domain  of 
the  Family  Court 
to  make"
"declarations  in relation to all actions “…  for divorce, nullity and separation”"
"and  in  the  absence  of  such  a  decree  made  to  that  effect  by  a  competent"
"Court,  it  must  be  concluded  that 
  the  Magistrate’s  Court,  in  order  to"
"determine the entitlement of the  Respondent to her claim of  maintenance"
"against  the  Appellant,  cannot  determine  the  validity  or  otherwise  of  a"
"marriage  referred  to 
in  the  Marriage  Certificate  “fm2”, 
in  the  guise  of"
"determining  whether  she  is  the  “spouse”  of  the  Appellant,  in  terms  of"
"Section  2  of  the  Maintenance  Act.  Therefore,  the  marriage  between  the"
"Appellant  and  Respondent,  confirmed  and  supported  by  the  Marriage"
"Certificate 
“fm2”,  remains  valid 
in 
the  absence  of  a  declaration  by  a"
"competent  Court 
to 
the  contrary  and  accordingly 
the 
status  of 
the"
"Respondent, as  the  “spouse”  of  the  Appellant, in  terms  of  Section  2  of  the"
"Maintenance  Act,  which  begun  with 
their  marriage  on 
that  Marriage"
"Certificate should remain unaltered."
"In  relation  to  a  marriage  contracted  under  the  provisions  of  the"
"Marriage  Registration  Ordinance,  it  must  be  stated  that  such  a  marriage"
"comes 
to  an  end  only  with 
the  decree  entered 
into 
that  effect  by  a"
"competent  Court  or  with  the  death  of  one  of  the  parties  to  the  said"
"marriage. To this limited extent I am in agreement with the phrase used by"
"the Appellant, that a Sinhalese man cannot have two valid marriages at the"
"same time."
