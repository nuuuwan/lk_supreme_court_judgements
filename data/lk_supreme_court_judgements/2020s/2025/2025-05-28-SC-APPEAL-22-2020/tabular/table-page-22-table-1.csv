"S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020"
"different  name.  The  respondent,  in  his  evidence  admitted  that  the  said"
"woman also  filed an application for maintenance and he was convicted for"
"bigamy 
in  respect  of  that  marriage.  During  the 
inquiry,  his  marriage"
"certificate to the other woman was marked as evidence."
"It is upon consideration of these set of circumstances that this Court"
"was  of  the  view  (at  p.  387)  that  “[T]he  existence  of  a  prior  marriage  is  an"
"absolute impediment to a second valid monogamous marriage contemplated by the"
"General  Marriages  Ordinance.  There  was  no  evidence  before  the  Magistrate-  or"
"even  at  least  a  suggestion-  that  at  the  time  of  the  respondent’s  marriage  to  the"
"appellant  [  applicant]  his 
first  wife  Anulawathie  was  dead  or  that  the 
first"
"marriage  had  been  dissolved  by  the  decree  of  a  competent  Court”  (emphasis"
"added)."
"Therefore,  the  factual  narrative  that  has  been  acted  upon  by  this"
"Court in making the said pronouncement in the judgment of Somawathie"
"v Wimalaratna, which was relied strongly by the Appellant in support of"
"his contention, could easily be distinguished from the factual narrative of"
"the instant appeal. The most striking distinguishing factor is the nature of"
"the proof that was presented before the Magistrate’s Court to establish the"
"marriage between the applicant and the respondent in that instance. In the"
"absence  of  any  reference 
to  tendering 
the  Marriage  Certificate  of  the"
"appellant with the respondent, and the marital relationship was sought to"
"be established only through an ‘admission’ made by the parties,  it clearly"
"Somawathie 
v 
distinguishes 
the 
instant 
appeal 
from 
the 
facts 
of"
"Wimalaratna. This Court, in that instance, proceeded on the basis that (at"
"p.  388)  “[S]ince  the  bigamous  marriage  which  was  void  ab  initio  did  not  create"
