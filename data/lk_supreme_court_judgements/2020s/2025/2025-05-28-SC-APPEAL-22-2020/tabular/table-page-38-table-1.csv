"S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020"
"“[T]he  District  Court  is  thus  empowered  to  administer  the  entire"
"matrimonial law of the land and this includes the Roman Dutch Law"
"relating  to  nullity  of  marriage.  Although  section  626(1)  of  the"
"Administration  of  Justice  (Amendment)  Law  makes  no  procedural"
"provisions in regard to grounds of nullity other than those set out in"
"the  Marriage  Registration  Ordinance,  still  this  will  not  hamstring"
"the Court from exercising its  matrimonial jurisdiction in its fullest"
"amplitude. The law will not fail for want of a procedure. Section 670"
"of 
the  Administration  of 
Justice 
(Amendment)  Law 
saves 
the"
"inherent  powers  of 
the  Court 
to  make  such  orders  as  may  be"
"necessary 
for  the  ends  of 
justice.  We  are  of  the  view  that  the"
"provisions  of  section 626  (1)  of  this  law  do  not  exclude  the  Roman"
"Dutch Law relating to nullity of marriage despite the absence of the"
"wide language of Section 607 of the Civil Procedure Code and of spe-"
"cific procedural provisions.”"
