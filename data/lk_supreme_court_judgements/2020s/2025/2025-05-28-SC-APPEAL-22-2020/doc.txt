S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal arising out of an order made by the Magistrate’s

Court, by overruling a preliminary objection raised by the Respondent-

Petitioner-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”)

in relation to a maintenance application made by the Applicant-

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

“Respondent”) against him under the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999.

Since the pronouncement of the said order by the Magistrate’s Court

and after a long an arduous journey through a multitude of litigation

processes, finally the question of legality of the said ruling made by the

Magistrate’s Court and the refusal of the Provincial High Court as well as

the Court of Appeal to set it aside by exercising revisionary jurisdiction,

had reached this Court for determination.

Since the litigation history between the parties had resulted in an

heavily entangled web of Court proceedings commencing from the

original Court and thereupon traversing through all the way up to the

apex Court, for the purpose of avoiding any impression of inconsistency

that might arise in the mind of the reader due to repetitive references made

to these multiple processes of litigation at different stages in the course of

this judgment, I shall endeavour to make a presentation, albeit brief, of the

important factual events in relation to the instant appeal and the

corresponding step in the relevant legal proceedings and to arrange them

in chronological order, in an attempt to ensure a cohesive judgment. In my

view this is an essential step that should be taken, even before I consider

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

5

the several questions of law on which the Counsel were heard, during the

hearing of this appeal.

The Appellant entered into a contract of marriage with the

Respondent on 17.06.1985, after complying with the statutory provisions

contained in the Marriage Registration Ordinance.

The Appellant was charged by the Magistrate’s Court in case No.

56041/01/93 for committing the offence of bigamy, by contracting a “null

and void marriage” with the Respondent while his wife to the previous

marriage is still among the living, and thereby committing an offence

punishable under Section 362B of the Penal Code. After trial, he was found

guilty to the said charge by the Magistrate’s Court on 18.12.1997.

Being aggrieved, the Appellant preferred an appeal to the Provincial

High Court against the said conviction, challenging its legal validity, in

appeal No. HCMCA 815/98, and the said appellate Court, by its judgment

dated 04.12.1998, allowed the appeal of the Appellant, by setting aside his

conviction for bigamy.

On an unspecified date in 2004, the Respondent filed an application

before the Magistrate’s Court of Colombo (case No. 3822/03/04), seeking an

order of Court for a maintenance allowance in favour of her and also on

behalf of her son, fathered by the Appellant.

The Appellant, whilst denying paternity of the child, raised a

preliminary objection to the maintainability of the said application on

29.10.2004, by pointing out that no supporting affidavit was filed along

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

6

with the application. The Respondent, conceding to the said objection,

withdrew her application, reserving her right to file it afresh.

On 03.11.2004, the Respondent filed her second application for

maintenance in Case No. 3828/03/04 and the Appellant once more raised

a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the said application on the

basis that the male child, on behalf of whom the Respondent sought

maintenance is in fact an adult offspring. The Magistrate’s Court overruled

the objection on 14.12.2004 and ordered an interim allowance.

The Appellant moved the Provincial High Court in revision of the

said order in Case No. HCRA 717/04. The appellate Court by its order

dated 29.05.2006, set aside the impugned order and directed that only the

Respondent is entitled to continue with the application.

On 28.08.2006, the Appellant raised another preliminary objection in

the said case No. 3828/03/04 before the Magistrate’s Court but this time

on the premise that the Respondent could not be considered as his

“spouse”, in terms of the Maintenance Act, as he was charged and

convicted to have committed the offence of bigamy and therefore his

‘marriage’ contracted with the Respondent is a nullity.

The Magistrate’s Court, by its order dated 12.02.2007, overruled the

said preliminary objection and proceeded to grant an interim allowance of

maintenance in favour of the Respondent.

The Appellant thereupon invoked revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court against that order in Case No. HCRA 29/2007. After

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

7

an inquiry, the Provincial High Court, by its order dated 10.06.2009,

dismissed the Appellant’s application.

The Appellant, sought special leave to appeal from this Court

against the said order of the Provincial High Court in

SC/Spl./LA/134/2009. This application too was dismissed by this Court

on 27.07.2009.

Thereafter, the Appellant had filed a revision application before the

Court of Appeal in case No. CA(PHC) APN 86/2009), by which he sought

to revise the order made by the Provincial High Court in case No.

HCRA/29/2007 dated 10.06.2009.

At the support stage of the said revision application, the Respondent

raised several a preliminary objection to its maintainability. One such

objection was that there were no exceptional circumstances that were

pleaded and urged by the Appellant, when he moved in revision against

the order made by the Provincial High Court.

The Court of Appeal, by its order dated 27.05.2016, overruled the

preliminary objections and proceeded to hold an inquiry into the merits of

the application of the Appellant.

After hearing the parties, the Court of Appeal, by its final order

dated 15.03.2018, dismissed the Appellant’s application.

The Appellant, thereupon moved this Court in application No.

SC/Spl./LA/101/2018 and after hearing Counsel for and against the said

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

8

application on 18.02.2020, it had decided to grant leave on the following

questions of law:

Has the Court of Appeal erred in Law by overruling its own

decision whereby the Court previously refused to dismiss the petition on a

preliminary objection taken up by the Respondent, which decision was not

set aside by the Supreme Court?

a. As Section 14(1) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999, provides

a right of appeal only in respect of orders made under Section2 or

11, did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal and the learned

High Court Judge err in Law by holding that there should have

been exceptional circumstances to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court against the impugned order, which

was not made under either of the aforesaid Sections ?

b. Are the judgments of the Court of Appeal and the High Court

contrary to the decision of your Lordships Court dated 03.11.2006

made in the case of Somawathie v Wimalaratna (2008) 1 Sri L.R.

384?

c. In view of the previous marriage between the Respondent, does

the Appellant falls within the definition of spouse as referred to

in Section 2(1) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999?

With the conclusion of the hearing of the instant appeal on

08.06.2022, on these questions of law, this Court directed the parties to

tender further written submissions on the question of law it had

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

9

formulated “whether there should be a declaration or order from a competent

Court with regard to the nullity of the 2nd marriage? ”. Only the Appellant had

thought it fit to assist Court.

In view of the scope of each question of law, it is prudent that each

of the questions are considered separately for the purpose of ensuring

clarity of this judgment.

The question of law contained in paragraph 17(a) of the petition of

the Appellant is as follows:

Has the Court of Appeal erred in Law by overruling its own

decision whereby the Court previously refused to dismiss the

petition on a preliminary objection taken up by the Respondent,

which decision was not set aside by the Supreme Court?

After the Appellant supported his application for Special Leave to

Appeal in SC/Spl./LA/134/2009 , this Court upon being persuaded by

the reasoning contained in the decisions of Wickramasekera v Officer in-

Charge, Police Station Ampara (2004) 1 Sri L.R. 257 and Abeywardene v

Ajith De Silva (1998) 1 Sri L.R. 134, dismissed that application on

27.07.2009. Thereafter the Appellant had taken steps to file an application

before the Court of Appeal (Court of Appeal case No. CA(PHC)APN

86/2009) by which he sought to revise the order made by the Provincial

High Court in case No. HCRA/29/2007 dated 10.06.2009. In order to avoid

any confusion that might arise in making references to the Appellant and

the Respondent before us, but were referred to in the order of the Court of

Appeal as the ‘petitioner’ and the ‘respondent’, I shall retain their

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

10

respective status before this Court, throughout this judgment in terms of

reference, for the sake of maintaining consistency.

In his petition dated 07.08.2009 filed before the Court of Appeal, the

Appellant states (in relation to the question of law on which this appeal

was heard by this Court), that Section 14(1) of the Maintenance Act only

provides for right to appeal for orders made under Sections 2 and 11, and

since the impugned order was not made under any of those two Sections,

the Provincial High Court was in error when it held that there should have

been exceptional grounds urged to invoke revisionary jurisdiction of that

Court. He also states that the impugned order of the High Court is

contrary to the decision of this Court made in Somawathie v

Wimalarathna in [2006] B.L.R. Vol XII, 110 and that it had misdirected

itself by holding that the acquittal of the Appellant by the Provincial High

Court in an appeal preferred against his conviction in the bigamy charge

by the Magistrate’s Court ( HCMCA/815/98), which made his ‘marriage’

to the Respondent a valid marriage.

The Respondent, in her capacity as the ‘respondent’ named in the

said application before the Court of Appeal, by filing a Statement of

Objections on 17.02.2010, resisted the Appellant’s application for revision

by seeking its dismissal. She also raised three preliminary objections in

that challenging the maintainability of the Appellant’s application. As her

first objection, she claimed that the Appellant failed to comply with the

provisions of Section 14(2) of the Maintenance Act, which states an appeal

against a judgment of the Provincial High Court could be lodged at the

Supreme Court only after obtaining leave from the relevant High Court.

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

11

She secondly claimed that the invocation of the revisionary jurisdiction of

the Provincial High Court is bad in law since the Appellant failed to

comply with the provisions of Section 14(1) of the Maintenance Act. The

third objection which the Respondent relied on was that the Appellant had

failed to adduce any exceptional circumstances in invoking the revisionary

jurisdiction conferred on the Provincial High Court as well as on the Court

of Appeal.

The parties have proceeded with the inquiry into the said

preliminary objections and the Court of Appeal, in delivering its order on

27.05.2016, overruled those objections and proceeded to determine the

Appellant’s application on merits. Thereupon, the Court of Appeal, by its

order dated 15.03.2018, dismissed the Appellant’s application to revise the

order of the Provincial High Court, delivered on 10.06.2009, which

affirmed the order of the Magistrate’s Court made on 12.02.2007.

In view of the question of law raised over the two orders made by

the Court of Appeal in respect of the Appellant’s revision application No.

CA(PHC) APN 86/2009, and to avoid any confusion in the reference to

those two orders in this judgment, it is proposed to refer to the order of the

Court of Appeal dated 27.05.2016 as the “1st order” and the order dated

15.03.2018, as the “2nd order” for the convenience of reference.

The Court of Appeal, decided to overrule the preliminary objections

raised by the Respondent after identifying those objections were raised “…

as to the maintainability of the Petitioner’s application as this Court has no

jurisdiction to maintain the same.” The Court had proceeded to describe the

objections raised by the Respondent that the Appellant, without moving in

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

12

revision against the impugned order of the Provincial High Court, should

have preferred an appeal in terms of Section 14(1) of the Maintenance Act,

as a remedy he failed to seek. In respect of this objection, the Court of

Appeal was of the view that “ … it is seen from the said impugned orders relate

only to the issue whether the Respondent is entitled to maintain her application for

maintenance despite the fact that the Petitioner’s first marriage has not been

dissolved, …”. Therefore, the Court concluded that “… the learned

Magistrate’s order is an incidental one which does not fall within the purview of

Section 14(1) …”. The Court had accepted the Appellant’s position that in

the said application he only challenged the order of the Magistrate in so far

“as to the maintainability of the Respondent’s claim for maintenance and not to

revise any order of maintenance”.

With regard to the objection of the Respondent that there are no

exceptional circumstances disclosed in the Appellant’s application, the

Court of Appeal, in its 1st order, held that “ … the Petitioner’s first marriage

has not been dissolved, at the time the marriage with the Petitioner took place. As

a result, the Petitioner was charged in the said Magistrate’s Court and convicted”.

It appears from that statement the Court of Appeal had acted on the

obvious inference it could draw, in view of the conviction entered against

the Appellant for committing the offence of bigamy, and therefore

considered the determination of the legal validity of the Appellant’s

subsequent marriage to the Respondent, as an exceptional ground in order

to overrule the preliminary objection raised on that point.

In the 2nd order of the Court of Appeal, after making a reference to

the fact that the Respondent’s main contention against the revision

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

13

application was that the Appellant had failed to adduce any exceptional

circumstances in the invocation of its jurisdiction, the appellate Court

accepted that position and held that “[I]n the instant case, the Petitioner has

failed to adduce necessary exceptional circumstances to invoke revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court”. It also held that it was for the Appellant to “…

establish that there had been no marriage between the [P]etitioner and the

[R]espondent and that the Petitioner has failed to adduce any evidence to that

effect” and in the absence of any proof of dissolution of the marriage of the

Appellant contracted with the Respondent, that second “marriage has to be

considered as a valid marriage.”

The Appellant, in raising the question of law that “[H]as the Court of

Appeal erred in Law by overruling its own decision whereby the Court previously

refused to dismiss the petition on a preliminary objection taken up by the

Respondent, which decision was not set aside by the Supreme Court ?”, has

obviously relied on the apparent inconsistency that exists between the 1st

order and the 2nd order over the issue whether there was any exceptional

circumstances. It was highlighted above that, in delivering the 1st order,

the Court of Appeal had apparently taken the fact of his conviction for the

offence of bigamy, together with his subsequent marriage to the

Respondent, coupled with the fact that she had placed reliance on the

validity of that ‘marriage’, in support of her own claim for maintenance as

a prima facie exceptional circumstance which it could inquire into, as no

such definitive finding was made on the consideration of merits of the

application by that Court. This determination contained in the 1st order

was made by the Court of Appeal at the threshold stage of the said

application being supported by the Appellant. Therefore, the said

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

14

pronouncement made by the Court of Appeal in its 1st order should be

viewed against its proper standing. The Respondent’s preliminary

objections were perceived by that Court as an objection to the invocation

of its jurisdiction and the Court was mindful of the fact that, at that stage

of the proceedings, it should only consider whether its jurisdiction was

properly invoked by the Appellant by his application and not whether it

should exercise its revisionary powers over the impugned order on that

application.

By the time the Court of Appeal pronounced its 2nd order, the

Provincial High Court had allowed the appeal preferred by the Appellant

against his conviction for bigamy. The fact that there was an appeal

pending against the conviction for bigamy was not referred to in the 1st

order by the Court of Appeal. In delivering the 2nd order, the Court of

Appeal, having noted that the Appellant “ … had been acquitted for lack or

mens rea since he states that he had heard no news from his 1st wife for 15 years”

and inserted a quotation from the judgment of the Provincial High Court

where it was stated that “ [I] see nothing wrong in the eyes of the law in

contracting the second marriage”, and accepted the pronouncement made by

the High Court that the second marriage was valid in law. This was the

basis on which the application of the Appellant survived the preliminary

objection.

A significant difference that exists between the 1st order and the 2nd

order is that, when the 1st order was made, there was already a conviction

entered against the Appellant by the Magistrate’s Court for committing the

offence of bigamy by marrying the Respondent, whilst his 1st wife was

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

15

living and without dissolving that marriage. But when the 2nd order was

pronounced this position has changed as the Appellant had invited the

attention of Court to the fact that he was acquitted by the Provincial High

Court after allowing his appeal preferred against the said conviction.

Apparently in making the 1st order, the Court of Appeal was not privy to

the outcome of the appeal preferred by the Appellant against the said

conviction.

Hence, it is clear that there is no pronouncement made by the Court

of Appeal contained in its 1st order that is in conflict with the 2nd order it

made, in respect of existence of exceptional circumstances and therefore

that question of law ought to be answered in the negative.

The question of law contained in paragraph 17(b) of the petition of

the Appellant is as follows:-

As Section 14(1) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999 provides a

right of appeal only in respect of orders made under Section 2 or 11,

did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal and the learned High

Court Judge err in Law by holding that there should have been

exceptional circumstances to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

the High Court against the impugned order, which was not made

under either of the aforesaid Sections?

The underlying argument that was relied on in framing the second

question of law seems to be that where a particular statute does not

provide for a right of appeal in respect of an order or judgment, and in

order to invoke its revisionary jurisdiction of the appellate Court, there

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

16

need not be a necessity to satisfy the existence of any exceptional

circumstances. The statute in question in this instance is the Maintenance

Act and, particularly Section 14(1), which confines the right of appeal

conferred on a person who is dissatisfied with an order made by the

Magistrate, only to an order made either under Section 2 or Section 11 of

that Act.

The Appellant’s contention on this point is since Section 14(1) of the

Maintenance Act restricts the right to appeal against “final orders” made

under Sections 2 and 11 as it speaks of a “final order pronounced by

Magistrate’s Court in a criminal case or matter” no other order made by that

Court, as in the instant appeal, could be appealed against. Therefore, the

order made by the Magistrate sought to be impugned by the said revision

application, becomes an order which could not be appealed against and,

unless moved in revision, the said provision left the Appellant without a

remedy. Hence, in view of the fact that only available remedy to the

Appellant was by way of revision, it was his contention that there need not

be any exceptional circumstances established either before the Provincial

High Court or before the Court of Appeal, in invoking the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction conferred on those Courts.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant, in support of that

contention, relied on the judgment of Rustom v Hapangama and Company

(1978-79-80) 1 Sri L.R. 352, where it stated that (at p. 360), “ … where the

revisionary powers of the Court of Appeal are invoked the practice has been that

these powers will be exercised if there is an alternative remedy available, only if the

existence of special circumstances are urged, necessitating the indulgence of this

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

17

Court to exercise its powers in revision” and this laid emphasis on the phrase

“if there is an alternative remedy available” to advance the contention that

where there is none, there is no need to adduce such circumstances.

It is correct to state that Section 14(1) indeed imposes such a

restriction on a party to a maintenance application by limiting the right of

appeal conferred by that Section only to orders made under either Section

2 or 11. Section 14(1) further provided certain restrictions on the Provincial

High Court too in relation to such orders, in the first of the two provisos

provided to that sub-Section. Relevant part of Section to the question of

law on this point is as follows:

“[A]ny person who shall be dissatisfied with any order made by a

Magistrate tinder section 2 or section 11 may prefer an appeal to the

relevant High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution

in like manner as if the order was a final order pronounced by

Magistrate's Court in a criminal case or matter, and sections 320 to

330 (both inclusive) and sections 357 and 358 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 shall, mutatis mutandis,

apply to such appeal; …”

The Appellant’s contention is clearly based on a phrase contained in

that Section, which in his interpretation, would read as if he were to prefer

an appeal against the order dated 12.02.2007, such an order should bear

the characteristics of a ‘final order’ and since the order impugned by his

revision application, being an interlocutory order which was made

overruling his objections on the issue of whether the Respondent could be

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

18

considered as his wife, such an order could not be qualified to be

considered as a ‘final order” in terms of that Section.

However, in advancing the said contention, the Appellant

conveniently ignores the full extent of the said order, and narrows it down

its scope as if the ruling made by that original Court concerns only his

objection. Perusal of the said order revels that the learned Magistrate has

made three determinations, which are referred to at the conclusion of the

said order. First, he determined that the Respondent is the wife of the

Appellant. Second, he decided to continue with the application of the

Respondent. Third, an order is made acting under the proviso to Section

11, to award an interim payment of maintenance in favour of the

Respondent and her son, until the application for an order for maintenance

is finally decided.

The order made by the learned Magistrate is specifically refereed to

the proviso to Section 11, which enabled him to make “an interim order for

the payment of a monthly allowance which shall remain operative until and order

on the application is made” in favour of the Respondent and her son. Thus,

there cannot be a doubt that the order dated 12.02.2007, is an order made

under Section 11 and therefore it qualifies to be included in the term “any

order” in Section 14(1), against which an appeal could be preferred.

However, the Legislature in its own wisdom has provided some protection

to the recipient of such an interim allowance by the inclusion of the words

to the first proviso of Section 14(1), by imposing a restriction that “… such

an order shall not be stayed by reason of such appeal, unless the High Court

directs otherwise for reasons to be recorded.” Thus, the impugned order of the

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

19

Court of Appeal which held that the Appellant needed to establish

exceptional circumstances in his revision application was correctly made

in view of the availability of an alternative remedy.

Even if one were to accept the Appellant’s contention that he is left

with no other remedy other than the revision against the interlocutory

order made by the Magistrate’s Court, in the Court of Appeal judgment of

Rasheed Ali v Mohamed Ali (1981) 2 Sri L.R. 29, after undertaking a

consideration of a series of judicial precedents on this point concluded (at

p. 33); “[I]t is well established that the powers of revision conferred on this Court

are very wide and the Court has the discretion to exercise them whether an appeal

lies or not or whether an appeal where it lies has been taken or not. But this

discretionary remedy can be invoked only where there are exceptional

circumstances warranting the intervention of the Court”. It is important to

note the expression “whether an appeal lies or not” in the context of the

question of law that must be decided by this Court. This pronouncement

was cited with approval by this Court in Union Culling Knit Garments

(Pvt) Ltd., and Others v Habib Bank (2004) 3 Sri L.R 128, at p. 133.

This principle was once more expressed by this Court in clearer

terms with its judgment in Bengamuwa Dhammaloka Thero v Dr. Cyril

Balasuriya (2010) 1 Sri L.R. 193. After making a reference to the

preliminary objection raised on the basis in the case of Rustom v

Hapangama (supra) to the effect that the plaintiff petitioner cannot invoke

the revisionary powers of the Court of Appeal as he had the right of appeal

against the said order of the Learned District Judge, and acting upon the

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

20

reasoning adopted by this Court in that instance, it was held that (at p.

204):

“… the powers by way of revision conferred on the Appellate Court

are very wide and can be exercised, whether an appeal has been taken

against an order of the original Court or not. It was also stated that

such revisionary powers could be exercised only in exceptional

circumstances and the types of such exceptional circumstances

would depend on the facts of each case”.

Thus, irrespective of the fact “whether an appeal lies or not” the judicial

precedents referred to above indicate that an applicant must establish

exceptional circumstances, when he moves an appellate Court to act in

revision. In view of the collective wisdom contained in these

pronouncements made by this Court, it must be stated that the Court of

Appeal has rightly expected the Appellant to adduce exceptional

circumstances in support of his application. Accordingly, the said question

of law too must be answered in the negative.

The question of law contained in paragraph 17(c) of the petition of

the Appellant is as follows:

Are the judgments of the Court of Appeal and the High Court

contrary to the decision of your Lordships Court dated 03.11.2006

made in the case of Somawathie v Wimalaratna (2008) 1 Sri L.R.

384?

In the context of the reference in Section 2 of the Maintenance Act, to

a “spouse” it is noted that the Legislature, in its wisdom thought it fit not to

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

21

provide a definition to the said term in the interpretation Section 22 of that

Act. The Appellant, in support of his submissions on the point that the

Respondent could not be considered as a “spouse” in terms of Section 2 of

the Maintenance Act, relied on the statement of Amaratunga J in the

judgment of Somawathie v Wimalaratna (2008) 1 Sri L.R. 384 , that “

[N]either the Ordinance not the Maintenance Act of 1999 contemplates the

payment of maintenance to a person who stands in a relationship other than that

of a wife or spouse” and therefore quotes H.R. Hahlo from his book on The

South African Law of Husband and wife (4th Ed, at p. 488) where the

learned author stated “ [A] void marriage does not entail any of the legal

consequences of a marriage. There is no reciprocal rights and duties of support

arising out of such a marriage. The nullity of a marriage is absolute and it may be

relied on by either party or by any interested third party even after the death of one

or both parties.”

The factual position presented before Court in Somawathie v

Wimalaratna (ibid) is fundamentally different to the position placed by the

Appellant and the Respondent in the instant appeal. In Somawathie v

Wimalaratna, the factual narrative indicates that the applicant and

respondent have only “admitted” their marriage before the Magistrate’s

Court. There was no marriage certificate that was produced before Court

in confirmation of the marriage between the parties. The material available

also disclosed that the applicant was earlier married to a person, who

disappeared during the 1988-89 period, and, having married the

respondent before a Registrar, she had lived with him as husband and

wife. The applicant, at a subsequent point of time, found out that her

‘husband’ the respondent, had already married another woman under a

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

22

different name. The respondent, in his evidence admitted that the said

woman also filed an application for maintenance and he was convicted for

bigamy in respect of that marriage. During the inquiry, his marriage

certificate to the other woman was marked as evidence.

It is upon consideration of these set of circumstances that this Court

was of the view (at p. 387) that “[T]he existence of a prior marriage is an

absolute impediment to a second valid monogamous marriage contemplated by the

General Marriages Ordinance. There was no evidence before the Magistrate- or

even at least a suggestion- that at the time of the respondent’s marriage to the

appellant [ applicant] his first wife Anulawathie was dead or that the first

marriage had been dissolved by the decree of a competent Court” (emphasis

added).

Therefore, the factual narrative that has been acted upon by this

Court in making the said pronouncement in the judgment of Somawathie

v Wimalaratna, which was relied strongly by the Appellant in support of

his contention, could easily be distinguished from the factual narrative of

the instant appeal. The most striking distinguishing factor is the nature of

the proof that was presented before the Magistrate’s Court to establish the

marriage between the applicant and the respondent in that instance. In the

absence of any reference to tendering the Marriage Certificate of the

appellant with the respondent, and the marital relationship was sought to

be established only through an ‘admission’ made by the parties, it clearly

distinguishes the instant appeal from the facts of Somawathie v

Wimalaratna. This Court, in that instance, proceeded on the basis that (at

p. 388) “[S]ince the bigamous marriage which was void ab initio did not create

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

23

any legal result, a Court was not entitled to rely on an admission made by the

respondent to invest the respondent’s second marriage with any validity it did not

and could not have in law.” This pronouncement is based on the premise

that the learned Counsel for the applicant did not “ … contend or seek to

argue that the respondent’s marriage to the appellant [applicant] is valid”, but

instead sought to rely on the common law concept of putative marriage to

“salvage” the case for his client. The fact that the respondent in

Somawathie v Wimalaratna had a conviction against him for commission

of the offence of bigamy, whereas either “the Appellant” or the

Respondent in the instant matter has no such impediment.

Learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant, nonetheless, had

strongly relied on certain pronouncements made in the said judgment in

support of his contention that the marriage of the Appellant to the

Respondent is ab initio void, and therefore a Court cannot rely on a

subsequent marriage that has been contracted, when one of the parties to

the previous marriage is still living, and as such, in order to have an order

of maintenance issued against the Appellant, the Respondent could not be

considered as the “spouse” in terms of the Section 2 of the Maintenance Act.

It appears that the Appellant’s said contention is premised on the finding

made by this Court (at p. 388), “[T]hus, the legal position apparent from the

evidence before the Magistrate was that the respondent’s marriage to the appellant

[applicant] was void ab initio”. But this Court made no pronouncement as to

the legal status of the ‘marriage’ between the applicant and the respondent

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

24

but only made an observation that it is “apparent” to Court that the

marriage was void ab initio, based on the material presented before Courts.

In the said judgement, their Lordships have further held (at p. 389)

that the “… appeal has to be decided according to provisions of the repealed

Maintenance Ordinance and as such the interpretation of Section 2 of the

Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999 and the word “spouse” appearing in Section 2

thereof has no relevance to this appeal.”

Having examined the impugned order of the Court of Appeal and

the orders of the Provincial High Court as well as of the Magistrate’s

Court, carefully and in the light of these pronouncements made in the said

instance by this Court, I am unable to find that any of the Courts below

have acted in any manner contrary to the principles that were enunciated

in the judgment of Somawathie v Wimalaratna (ibid) and accordingly the

question of law raised in that regard must also be answered in the

negative.

The question of law formulated by this Court during the hearing of

this appeal is as follows;

In view of the previous marriage between the Appellant and the

Respondent, does the Respondent falls within the definition of ‘spouse’ as

referred to in Section 2(1) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999?

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

25

In my opinion, the core issue this Court must decide, in respect of

the instant appeal, is encapsulated in this fifth question of law, which was

formulated by the Court during the hearing stage of the instant appeal and

to which the parties were afforded an opportunity to address Court.

The position of the Appellant presented before this Court in this

regard could be reduced to a simple statement. What he says is that he

cannot validly marry the Respondent, while his first marriage remains a

valid one and that too by operation of law. He uses a catchy phrase to

drive in this point by stating that a Sinhalese man cannot have two valid

marriages at the same time. In fact, that is his consistent position

throughout the long and complex process of litigation, since which

commenced with the filing of the Respondent’s application in the

Magistrate’s Court. In his petition dated 24.04.2018, the Appellant

proposed a question of law which reads “ [I]s the judgment of the Court of

Appeal contrary to Section 18 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance, which

specifies that ‘No marriage shall be valid where either of the parties thereto shall

have contracted a prior marriage which shall not have been legally dissolved or

declared void’ ?”

In response to the application filed by the Respondent for an order

of maintenance, the Appellant, in his Statement of Objections dated

28.08.2006, averred inter alia that he was charged before the same

Magistrate’s Court in case No. 56041/01/93, for committing the offence of

bigamy, punishable under Section 362B of the Penal Code as amended.

The Magistrate’s Court, after a trial and by its judgment pronounced on

18.12.1997, entered a conviction against the Appellant. The Charge of

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

26

bigamy on which the Appellant was convicted, in itself, contained the

allegation that the marriage between him and the Respondent was

contracted during the life time of his first wife Meemanage Pathmini Perera.

Placing reliance on that accusation, the Appellant further averred that

owing for that very reason, his marriage to the Respondent became a

nullity and therefore she has no legal status as his spouse, which made her

entitled to claim maintenance.

The Appellant further states in his said Statement of Objections that

after hearing of the appeal preferred by him against the said conviction,

the Provincial High Court, by its judgment dated 04.12.1988 (a copy of

which was annexed to the Statement of Objections), proceeded to set aside

his conviction. He further stated that he was acquitted by the Provincial

High Court not on the basis of nullity of his second marriage, but on the

basis that at the time of entering into his second marriage, the first wife

was continually absent from him for a period of seven years and that she

shall not have been heard by him as being alive within that time. The

Court also noted that the Appellant (being the respondent before that

Court) had declared that factual position to the Respondent in the instant

appeal, at the time of contracting the second marriage. (“ tfia ;SrKh lrk

jH;sf¾Lh hg;g jefgk fyhska nj’’’”).

In view of the position taken up by the Appellant, a consideration of

the status of the Appellant in terms of the applicable legal principles,

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

27

particularly at the time he contracted his second marriage to the

Respondent, becomes an absolute necessity.

Learned Counsel for the Respondent relied on the copy of the extract

of the Register of Marriage, confirming the marriage of the Appellant and

the Respondent, that was tendered to the Magistrate’s Court by the

Respondent as an annexture to her application for maintenance, marked

“fm2”. He invited our attention to the status of the Respondent, described

therein as “unmarried”, while the status of the Appellant is described as the

husband of Padmini Perera, whose whereabouts were unknown for seven

years (“ y;a jirlska wd.sh w;la fkdo;a moañkS fmf¾rdf.a újyl mqreIhd”).

Section 52 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance states that such a

copy issued under section 35A “… shall be received as prima facie evidence of

the matter to which it relates, without any further or other proof of such entry”.

The same Ordinance, by its Sections 18, declares that “[N]o marriage shall be

valid where either of the parties thereto shall have contracted a prior marriage

which shall not have been legally dissolved or declared void”. Moreover, Section

19(1), too states that; [N]o marriage shall be dissolved during the lifetime of the

parties except by judgment of divorce a vinculo matrimonii pronounced in some

competent court.”

It is undisputed that the marriage between the Appellant and

Padmini Perera was not dissolved by a judgment of divorce, pronounced by

a competent Court. There is no averment or of the existence of any official

acknowledgement of the death of Padmini Perera in the Statement of

Objections tendered to the Magistrate’s Court either. The Marriage

Certificate “fm2”, merely describes Padmini Perera as a person whose

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

28

whereabouts were unknown for seven years. Therefore, status of the

Appellant, at the time of contracting the marriage to the Respondent,

described as being the husband of Padmini Perera, ought to be considered

as a party to a marriage “… which shall not have been legally dissolved or

declared void”.

Then a question would arise as to how the District Registrar, acting

on powers conferred to him in terms of the statutory provisions contained

in the same Ordinance, had taken steps to register the marriage between

the Appellant and the Respondent as a valid marriage, knowing very well

of the status of the Appellant as the husband of Padmini Perera, and

thereby acting contrary to the express provisions that declare of the status

of such a marriage as void?

The answer to this question lies in Sections 107 and 108 of the

Evidence Ordinance, as emended, since the applicable principles of

evidence contained therein are described as the Presumptions as to Life and

to Death.

Section 107 reads thus: “[W]hen the question is whether a man is alive or

dead, and it is shown that he was alive within thirty years, the burden of proving

that he is dead is on the person who affirms it. Coomaraswamy, in his treatise on

the Law of Evidence has classified both these Sections of the Evidence

Ordinance under the heading “Special presumptions which the Court shall

draw” (at Vol II, Book 1, p. 428), and describes the Presumption as to life in

terms of Section 107 as ( ibid, at p. 429) “[I]n the absence of any ground for

inferring the contrary, the life of a person, proved to have been alive and well on a

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

29

particular day, will be presumed to continue at any rate for some short time

afterwards.”

Learned author thereupon proceeds to describe the Presumption as to

Life, as (ibid) “[I]n the absence of any ground for interfering the contrary, the life

of a person, proved to have been alive and well on a particular day, will be

presumed to continue at any rate for some short time afterwards” and adds that

“(at p. 428) “ … in all cases contemplated by those Sections, as the law directs on

whom the burden of proof is to lie, no option is given to the Judge as to whether he

will presume the fact or not. He is bound in every case to presume the contrary or

opposite of what is stated therein against the party on whom the burden of proof is

directed to lie and in favour of the other party.”

If the Presumption as to Life, in respect of the wife of the Appellant to

his first marriage in terms of Section 107 of the Evidence Ordinance, could

be rebutted, the Appellant is freed from the shackles of the said statutory

requirement, imposed by Section 19(1) of the Marriage Registration

Ordinance, which states that no marriage shall be dissolved during the

lifetime of the parties, except by judgment of divorce a vinculo matrimonii,

pronounced by a competent Court. Learned Counsel for the Respondent

relied on the case of Welgama v Wijesundera and another (2006) 1 Sri L.R.

110, where Sarath Silva CJ observed that (at p.122) “[T]he presumption of life

continues to apply since the person has been alive within thirty years and a party

not being possessed of evidence to prove the fact of death, adduces evidence short of

that by proving that the person has not been heard for seven years (prior to the

amendment) by those who would naturally have heard of him if he had been alive,

then the presumption shifts and it is presumed that the person is dead. In such

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

30

circumstances the party who alleges that the person is alive has to prove that fact

on a balance of probability. The presumption of life is no longer operative”.

Since the strength of this presumption always depends on the age of

the person, his health and other circumstances of his life, the Deputy

Registrar, before proceeding to solemnise the 2nd marriage between the

Appellant and the Respondent, would have satisfied himself of the

justification to act on the inference that the Presumption as to Life with

regard to the wife of the Appellant in their first marriage was sufficiently

rebutted. Hence, the second marriage solemnised by him is not contrary to

the statutory provisions contained in Sections 18 and 19(1) of the Marriage

Registration Ordinance.

In 1988, Section 108 of the Evidence Ordinance was amended by Act

No. 10 of 1988 in order to reduce the seven-year period that required for

the rebuttal of the said presumption to a period of one year. Despite the

said amendment, the Deputy Registrar had acted on the seven-year period

requirement, perhaps in view of provisions contained in Section 608(2)(b)

of the Civil Procedure Code as well as the provisions contained in the

Exception to Section 362A of the Penal Code.

The prosecution that was subsequently instituted against the

Appellant, upon the solemnisation of his second marriage to the

Respondent, proceeded on the premise that his wife to the first marriage,

Padmini Perera, was living when he contracted his second marriage and

therefore, he committed the offence of bigamy since his second marriage

has taken place during the life of his “former wife”. During the trial, the

prosecution led the evidence of Padmini Perera in support of its allegation

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

31

against the Appellant. However, the conviction entered against the

Appellant by the Magistrate’s Court was set aside by the Provincial High

Court by allowing his appeal on the basis that he is entitled to the benefit

of the Exception to the Section 362B, since that former wife was “…

continually absent from such person for the space of seven years and shall have not

been heard of by such person as being alive within that time.”

It is clear that the Appellant, by advancing the contention that has

been referred to earlier on in this judgment, and after having successfully

rebutted the Presumption as to Life in relation to Padmini Perera, now seeks

to rely on the fact that she is very much alive, and thus he is incapable in

law to contract a second, legally valid marriage, a fact which makes the

Respondent entitled to claim maintenance from him.

Learned Magistrate, in his order dated 12.02.2007, rejected the

objection of the Appellant that the Respondent is not entitled to claim

maintenance from him on the basis there is no legally valid marriage exists

between them. It is important to closely examine the process of reasoning

adopted by that Court in arriving at that finding.

The Magistrate’s Court, having taken note of the fact that the

Appellant was acquitted by the Provincial High Court from the charge of

bigamy, noted that nonetheless there is no order of Court up to that point

in time annulling his marriage to the Respondent. The Court also noted

that since there is a finding that the Appellant did not commit the offence

of bigamy, the admitted and proved marriage between the Appellant and

the Respondent could not be taken as a null and void marriage. Therefore,

the inquiring Court had accepted the position presented by the

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

32

Respondent before it that the Appellant had failed to establish before the

said Court that the marriage between him and the Respondent is null and

void.

When the Appellant moved the Provincial High Court against the

said order by invoking its revisionary jurisdiction, the appellate Court also

accepted the validity of that reasoning and added that it was for him to

establish that the marriage on which the claim of maintenance founded is a

nullity in law. It further noted that the Magistrate’s Court did not inquire

into the question which of the two marriages is valid. Thereupon, the

Provincial High Court held that, if the material indicates that there is a

valid marriage between the parties and the requisites of Section 2 or 11 of

the Maintenance Act are satisfied, it was the Magistrate’s responsibility to

make an order for an allowance of maintenance. The appellate Court also

noted that the marriage referred in the marriage certificate presented

before the Magistrate’s Court is accepted by both the parties.

The Appellant thereupon moved the Court of Appeal, against the

order of the Provincial High Court in dismissing his application made in

terms of Article 138(1) of the Constitution, seeking to set it aside. The

paragraph 13 of the petition dated 07.08.2009, contains some of the

grounds averred by the Appellant in invoking the jurisdiction of the Court

of Appeal, which includes;

i. there is no right of appeal to the impugned order of the

Magistrate’s Court and therefor insisting on exceptional

circumstances by the Provincial High Court is

erroneous,

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

33

ii. the order of the Provincial High Court is contrary to the

decision in Somawathie v Wimalaratne [2006] B.L.J.

Vol. XII, p. 110,

iii. the Provincial High Court held that the acquittal of the

Appellant from the charge of bigamy was due to

absence of mens rea and his second marriage also stands

valid,

iv. the Provincial High Court erred in its failure to consider

that the Magistrate’s Court, in two different orders, held

in one that the marriage of the Appellant to the

Respondent is valid, whilst in the other held that the

said subsequent marriage is a nullity, in view of the fact

that it was never dissolved by a competent Court.

In resisting the said application, the Respondent in her Statement of

Objections to the Court of Appeal dated 17.02.2010, has averred that the

Appellant failed to adduce any exceptional circumstances, the 2nd marriage

had not been held to void by a civil Court, the duty of the Magistrate is to

determine the validity of the Marriage Certificate and nothing more and

that he admitted the marriage between them.

The Court of Appeal, by its order dated 15.03.2018, held that the

Appellant is liable to pay maintenance to his wife before proceeding to

dismiss his application. That Court considered the provisions of Section

108 of the Evidence Ordinance in the light of the judgment of Welgama v

Wijesundera (1990) 1 Sri L.R. 59, and in support of its conclusion that “ …

the burden is on the petitioner to establish that there had been no marriage

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

34

between the petitioner and respondent and the petitioner has failed to adduce any

evidence to that effect.”

It is to be noted in this context, that the application of the

Respondent for an order of maintenance against the Appellant did not

proceed for inquiry beyond the point of the pronouncement of the

interlocutory order as the complex process of litigation that ensued had

commenced immediately thereafter. Thus, the only material available

before the original Court, at that particular point in time, was that the

application of the Respondent supported by the Marriage Certificate, the

Statement of Objections of the Appellant, and the judgement of the

Provincial High Court on the appeal against his conviction for bigamy,

which was tendered annexed to it.

Even if the inquiry did proceed on into the claim of maintenance of

the Respondent, the Magistrate’s Court had no jurisdiction to declare any

of the two marriages contracted by the Appellant as a nullity. That

jurisdiction is conferred only the Family Court by Section 24(1) of the

Judicature Act No.2 of 1978, as amended, as that Section states it “… shall

have sole original jurisdiction in respect of matrimonial disputes, actions for

divorce, nullity and separation, …”. The words “sole original jurisdiction” that

appear in that Section needs no further clarification as to what it meant.

The Civil Procedure Code, in Chapter XLII, sets out the applicable

procedure in relation to all matrimonial actions. Section 596 refers to three

such matrimonial actions which it had broadly classified into. They are the

“actions for divorce a vinculo matrimonii”, actions “for separation a mensa et

thoro”, and also actions for “declaration of nullity of marriage,…”.

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

35

Importantly, the Section 607 of that Code carries a marginal note “ Actions

of nullity of marriage”, and states that in its subsection (1) that “[A]ny

husband or wife may present a plaint to the Family Court within the local limits of

the jurisdiction of which he or she (as the case may be) resides, praying that his or

her marriage may be declared null and void” whereas in subsection (2) states

that “[S]uch decree may be made on any ground which renders the marriage

contract between the parties void by the law applicable to Sri Lanka.”

Contention of the Appellant that his marriage to the Respondent is

void ab initio and, therefore he could not be ordered to pay maintenance,

was founded on the proposition that by mere operation of law, the second

marriage becomes nullified on account of his first wife being alive at the

time of contracting the second marriage and there is no necessity for him

to obtain a declaration to that effect made by a competent Court. On that

premise, the Appellant expects this Court to determine that the

Respondent could not be taken as his “spouse”, in terms of Section 2 of the

Maintenance Act, and that too simply by operation of law.

This very proposition was considered by this Court in the judgment

of Seneviratne v Premalatha (2016) 1 Sri L.R. 82. In that instance, one of

the questions of law on which the said appeal was argued was, “In terms of

the provisions of Section 18 of the Marriages (General) Ordinance No. 19 of 1907

as amended, read together with the provisions of Section 607 of the Civil

Procedure Code, is it imperative for any husband or wife to present a Plaint

praying that his/her marriage may be declared null and void on any of the grounds

recognized by the law applicable to Sri Lanka?”

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

36

Gooneratne J, after taking into consideration of the deceitful conduct

of the respondent that he contracted the marriage in question by

supressing the fact that he was already married twice, answered the said

question of law in the affirmative. The line of reasoning adopted by his

Lordship in arriving at the said conclusion was influenced by the

following quotation, reproduced in that judgment (at p. 90) taken from the

Text Book on Family Law by Jonathan Herring (6th Ed, at p.59):

“If at the time of the ceremony either party is already married to

someone else the 'marriage' will be void. The marriage will remain

void even if the first spouse dies during the second 'marriage'. So, if

a person is married and wishes to marry someone else, he or she

must obtain a decree of divorce or wait until the death of his or her

spouse. If the first marriage is void, it is technically not necessary to

obtain a Court order to that effect before marrying again, but that is

normally sought to avoid any uncertainty. In cases of bigamy, as

well as the purported marriage being void, the parties may have

committed the crime of bigamy” (emphasis original).

Thus, the most prudent action that should be taken by a party, if it

were to have its marriage nullified, rather than merely pointing out to a

provision of law by which such marriages are said to be null and void, is to

must obtain a declaration to that effect by a competent Court. The view

adopted by this Court in that instance is not of a recent origin, for in

Navaratnam v Navaratnam (1945) 46 NLR 361, too is an instance where

the plaintiff, who was of Sri Lankan domicil, sued the defendant, who until

her marriage, had been an Indian domicil, for a declaration that the

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

37

marriage solemnised between them on March 12, 1936, was null and void

on the ground that the defendant gave birth to a child about three months

after the marriage and that the plaintiff was unaware that the defendant

was pregnant and that the plaintiff before the marriage never had access to

the defendant.

Keuneman SPJ, after rejecting the contention, that Section 597 of the

Civil Procedure Code relates only to actions for dissolution on the ground

of adultery or other causes which supervenes after the marriage, and that

Section does not apply where it is claimed that the marriage was bad ab

initio, observed (at p.368) that “[A]t first sight this argument appears

convincing, but I do not think upon examination it can be sustained. Section 597

uses very wide language, viz., " any ground for which the marriage .... may be

dissolved ". Can this 'action be regarded as an action for the dissolution of the

marriage? I think it can” and held (at p. 368) “ … that this type of action is in

substance an action for dissolution, and that the marriage will be regarded as

subsisting until a declaration of nullity is entered.”

The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Peiris v Peiris (78-79) 2 Sri

L.R. 55, dealt with an action filed before the District Court under the

administration of justice law seeking a declaration of nullity of a marriage,

and a question arose before the Court of Appeal whether the ground on

which such a declaration could be sought is limited to the grounds that are

specified in Section 18 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance.

Soza J, in view of the wording of Section 607 of the Civil Procedure

Code held that (at p. 57):

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

38

“[T]he District Court is thus empowered to administer the entire

matrimonial law of the land and this includes the Roman Dutch Law

relating to nullity of marriage. Although section 626(1) of the

Administration of Justice (Amendment) Law makes no procedural

provisions in regard to grounds of nullity other than those set out in

the Marriage Registration Ordinance, still this will not hamstring

the Court from exercising its matrimonial jurisdiction in its fullest

amplitude. The law will not fail for want of a procedure. Section 670

of the Administration of Justice (Amendment) Law saves the

inherent powers of the Court to make such orders as may be

necessary for the ends of justice. We are of the view that the

provisions of section 626 (1) of this law do not exclude the Roman

Dutch Law relating to nullity of marriage despite the absence of the

wide language of Section 607 of the Civil Procedure Code and of spe-

cific procedural provisions.”

Section 2(1) of the Maintenance Act, only states that any person

having sufficient means “ … neglects or unreasonably refuses to maintain such

person’s spouse, who is unable to maintain himself or herself” and upon such an

application being made to Court and upon proof of such neglect or

unreasonable refusal, it could make an “ … order such person to make a

monthly allowance for the maintenance of such spouse”, if the other conditions

that are specified in that subsection and in the proviso are satisfied. Hence,

the entitlement to a monthly allowance of maintenance is essentially

dependent on the status of the applicant, for he or she must qualify to be

considered as “spouse” of the person against whom the application is

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

39

made. In this regard the Certificate of Marriage indeed provides sufficient

undisputed proof of that fact.

Since it is the exclusive domain of the Family Court to make

declarations in relation to all actions “… for divorce, nullity and separation”

and in the absence of such a decree made to that effect by a competent

Court, it must be concluded that the Magistrate’s Court, in order to

determine the entitlement of the Respondent to her claim of maintenance

against the Appellant, cannot determine the validity or otherwise of a

marriage referred to in the Marriage Certificate “fm2”, in the guise of

determining whether she is the “spouse” of the Appellant, in terms of

Section 2 of the Maintenance Act. Therefore, the marriage between the

Appellant and Respondent, confirmed and supported by the Marriage

Certificate “fm2”, remains valid in the absence of a declaration by a

competent Court to the contrary and accordingly the status of the

Respondent, as the “spouse” of the Appellant, in terms of Section 2 of the

Maintenance Act, which begun with their marriage on that Marriage

Certificate should remain unaltered.

In relation to a marriage contracted under the provisions of the

Marriage Registration Ordinance, it must be stated that such a marriage

comes to an end only with the decree entered into that effect by a

competent Court or with the death of one of the parties to the said

marriage. To this limited extent I am in agreement with the phrase used by

the Appellant, that a Sinhalese man cannot have two valid marriages at the

same time.

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

40

The Court of Appeal as well as the Provincial High Court have

affirmed the order of the Magistrate’s Court which overruled the

preliminary objection raised by the Appellant challenging the

Respondent’s status as the “spouse” on the basis that he failed to establish

that their marriage is null and void. In view of the reasoning contained in

the preceding paragraphs, I am convinced that the said conclusion reached

by the Magistrate’s Court and its affirmation by the appellate Courts were

correctly made, in terms of the applicable laws. I regret of my inability to

accept the learned President’s Counsel’s submission that the Charge Sheet

that had been served on the Appellant alleging that the marriage reflected

in “fm2” as “void” and the statement of the Provincial High Court “[T]his

Section stated in simple language enacts that a husband or wife marries again

while his or her earlier spouse is living such marriage is no marriage in the eye of

the law” would suffice to fill that void created by him, in relation to his

case.

Accordingly, the question of law whether the Appellant, in view of

his previous marriage, falls within the definition of “spouse” as referred to

in Section 2(1) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999, ought to be

answered in the affirmative.

In view of the answers to the several questions of law I am of the

opinion that the appeal of the Appellant ought to be dismissed.

It is quite unfortunate that the determination of the instant appeal

fails to bring an end to the dispute over the entitlement of a maintenance

allowance to the Respondent as the inquiry into her application to that

effect was stalled due to the long process of litigation initiated by the

S.C. Appeal No. 22/2020

41

Appellant over an interlocutory order made by that Court. If the intention

of the Appellant was to frustrate the Respondent by prolonging the legal

process in relation to the determination of maintenance, I must say that he

was more than successful in that endeavour. However, in view of the

above reasoning and of the answers to the questions of law, I affirm the

orders made by the Court of Appeal, the Provincial High Court and the

Magistrate’s Court, that were considered in detail by this Court.

The appeal of the Appellant is accordingly dismissed. The

Respondent is entitled to costs of this Court as well as costs of the Court of

Appeal.
