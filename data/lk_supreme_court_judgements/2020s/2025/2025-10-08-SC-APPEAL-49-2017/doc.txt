Janak De Silva, J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant (Appellant) instituted this action against the 1st and 2nd

Defendant-Respondent-Respondents (Respondents) seeking a judgment for the specific

performance of an agreement to sell. In the alternative, the Appellant prayed for damages

in a sum of Rs. 50,00,000/=.

The learned District Judge of Avissawella dismissed the action. Aggrieved by the dismissal,

the Appellant preferred an appeal to the High Court of the Western Province exercising

Civil Appellate jurisdiction at Avissawella (High Court) which was dismissed.

Leave to appeal has been granted on following questions of law:

(1) Did the High Court Judges err in law, by failing to analyze the law applicable in the

context of specific performance in the original court action filed by the Appellant

in seeking a judgment under the law of contracts against the Respondents?

(2) Did the High Court Judges err in law by not considering the fact that there was no

issue raised at the trial in the original court or at the hearing of the appeal in the

High Court as to the dismissing of the action of the Appellant for not depositing the

balance purchase money of the transaction at the outset of filing the action in the

original court?

(3) Did the High Court Judges err in law by not exercising their judicial mind in to the

fact that which party has repudiated the contract between the two parties based

on the sales agreement marked as P5 at the trial in the Original Court?

(4) Did the High Court Judges err in law by considering that specific performance of

the contract between the parties was an inappropriate remedy when there is an

Page 5 of 18

uncertainty regarding the providing a road access to the land sought to be blocked

out in terms of clause 5 of the agreement?

Factual Matrix

One Padmini Ranasinghe, being the original owner of the corpus forming the subject

matter of the agreement to sell, transferred an undivided 1/3 share thereof to the 1st

Respondent, another undivided 1/3 share to the 2nd Respondent and the remaining

undivided 1/3 share to one Kudamadurage Sitthi, the mother of the 1st Respondent.

By her last will, Sitthi bequeathed her undivided 1/3 share to the 1st Respondent.

Testamentary proceedings were instituted in D.C. Avissawella Case No. 1271/T to prove

the last will of Kudumadurage Sitthi.

The agreement to sell between the Appellant and the 1st and 2nd Respondents bearing

No. 2378 dated 14.10.2002 (P5) was executed and attested to by Athula Walisundara,

Notary Public.

Therein, the Respondents agreed to sell the corpus to Appellant for a sum of Rs.

72,50,000/= subject to the following terms and conditions:

In terms of Clause 2 of the agreement to sell, the Appellant paid an advance of Rs.

10,00,000/= to the Respondents on the day the agreement was executed. The Appellant

agreed to pay another Rs. 10,00,000/= to the Respondents after due administration of

the estate of Kudumadurage Sitthi. One of the contentious issues between the parties

was the correct interpretation of Clause 3.

Version of the Appellant

The Respondents failed to take steps to conclude the testamentary proceedings in D.C.

Avissawella Case No. 1271/T where the last will of Kudumadurage Sitthi was sought to be

Page 7 of 18

proved. In particular, the Respondents failed to take steps to execute an executors

conveyance. The obligation to pay a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/= as set out in Clause 3 of the

agreement to sell arose only upon the execution of the executors conveyance.

The Appellant by letter of demand dated 14.10.2006 sent by Athula Walisundara,

Attorney-at-Law, made a demand for the transfer of the corpus. This request was willfully

disregarded and/or refused by the Respondents.

In the circumstances, the Respondents have deliberately and knowingly breached the

terms and conditions of the agreement to sell.

Version of the Respondent

The testamentary proceedings in D.C. Avissawella Case No. 1271/T was over on

04.10.2004 and the probate was issued to 1st Respondent, who was the legatee of the 1/3

undivided share of Sitthi.

The Appellant did not pay Rs.10,00,000/- to the Respondents as stipulated in Clause 3 of

the agreement to sell. Thereby, the Appellant has repudiated the agreement to sell.

In the agreement to sell, there was no specific date to transfer the corpus to the

Appellant. Therefore, the transfer should take place within a reasonable time.

Accordingly, the letter of demand dated 14.10.2006 sent by Athula Walisundara Attorney-

at-Law was not sent within reasonable time.

The Appellant did not have financial capacity to fulfill the conditions of the agreement to

sell within a reasonable time.

Judgment of the District Court

The learned trial judge held that the obligation on the part of the Appellant to pay a sum

of Rs. 10,00,000/= in terms of Clause 3 of the agreement to sell arose only after the

executors conveyance was executed. However, he concluded that the Appellant had

Page 8 of 18

failed to establish that the 1st Respondent was duly notified to execute the executors

conveyance.

The executors conveyance was signed only on 24.08.2007. The letter demand by the

Appellant was sent to the Respondents on 14.10.2006. Hence the learned trial judge held

that there was no obligation on the part of the Respondents to transfer the corpus to the

Appellant as at that date.

It was further held that the Appellant has not breached the agreement to sell by failing to

pay the balance sum within a reasonable period from 14.10.2004.

The learned trial judge emphasized that specific performance is a discretionary remedy.

There must be access to the corpus. It must be provided with the consent of a third party.

The learned trial judge observed that here is no prayer in the plaint seeking such access.

In any event, he concluded that its availability depends on the consent of a third party.

Moreover, the trial judge observed that the Appellant had failed to deposit a sum of Rs.

62,50,000/= in Court as required by Clause 6 of the agreement to sell.

The Appellant has not been able to prove a reasonable basis for assessing the damages

claimed. Furthermore, no breach of the agreement to sell has been proved.

On these grounds, the learned trial judge decided that the Appellant’s case has not been

proved and dismissed the action with costs.

Judgment of the High Court

The High Court held that upon a perusal of the evidence, it was clear that the Appellant

intended to purchase the corpus for the purpose of selling after blocking out. The

evidence revealed that there was no access from the main road to the land. The

Respondents agreed to provide a road way 30 feet in width in terms of clause 5 of the

Page 9 of 18

agreement to sell. The evidence of the 1st Respondent was that a 3rd party had agreed to

provide a road way through his land to gain access to the land in dispute.

The testamentary proceedings in D.C. Avissawella Case No. 1271/T were terminated on

04.10.2004. The Appellant failed to prove that it sought to pay a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/=

after the conclusion of the testamentary proceedings.

Furthermore, the High Court held that there was an uncertainty in regard to the clause 5

of the sales agreement, and hence specific performance of the sales agreement would be

an inappropriate remedy.

The Appellant had failed to deposit a sum of Rs. 62,50,000/= in Court prior to the

institution of the case as agreed to in clause 6 of the sales agreement.

Accordingly, High Court of Civil Appellate held that the learned District Judge was correct

in dismissing the action of the Appellant.

Specific Performance (ad pecuniam solvendam)

The governing law of the right to claim specific performance of an agreement to sell

immovable property is Roman-Dutch law [Thaheer v. Abdeen (57 NLR 1 at 3)]. I will

therefore briefly examine the availability of this remedy in Roman-Dutch law.

It is not clear whether specific performance was a remedy available in Roman law. Lee

makes contradictory statements in stating that decrees of specific performance were

unknown [Lee R.W., The Elements of Roman Law, IV Edition, Sweet & Maxwell (1956),

441] while later claiming that specific performance may be decreed [ibid. page 457].

Weeramantry [The Law of Contracts, Vol. 2, (Lawman (India) Pvt., Reprint 1999) pgs. 952-

953] explains that during the formulary period, Roman law did not compel specific

performance. It was sufficient for the payment of id quod interest. He opines that given

that the maxim of Roman law being nemo potest praecise cogi ad factum (no one can be

Page 10 of 18

compelled to perform a specific act), it was unusual for the grant of the remedy of specific

performance.

There is a divergence of opinion among jurists of the availability of specific performance

in Roman Dutch law.

According, to Van Der Linden [1.14.7], where the obligation consists in performing a

particular act, the oblige may sue the obligor for the performance of that act, or

compensation in damages and interest.

Grotius [3.3.41] states that although by natural law a person who has promised to do

something is bound to do it if it is in his power, he may nevertheless by municipal law

release himself by paying the other contracting party the value of his interest in the same

or the penalty, if any, which has been agreed upon in default of payment.

Van Leeuwen was of the view that specific performance may be compelled where a

promise is made to perform something or cause it to be done [Com. 4.2.13].

Weeramantry [supra. pages 953-954] concluded that the Roman-Dutch law of Holland

would grant specific performance in contracts of sale and in contracts ad dandum

generally and that it would also grant the relief where possible in contracts ad faciendum.

It being an equitable remedy, there are situations where the Court may refuse to order

specific performance in circumstances where the defaulting party is unable to comply

with an order for specific performance such as where the property to be delivered has

been destroyed [Grotius 3.47.1].

The locus classicus of the position in the law of South Africa is found in Farmers’ Co-op

Society (Reg) v. Berry [(1912) AD 343 at 350] where Innes, J. held:

“Prima facie every party to a binding agreement who is ready to carry out his own

obligation under it has a right to demand from the other party, so far as it is

Page 11 of 18

possible, a performance of his undertaking in terms of the contract. As remarked

by KOTZE C.J., in Thompson vs. Pullinger (1 O. R., at p. 301), “the right of a plaintiff

to the specific performance of a contract where the defendant is in a position to do

so is beyond doub”. It is true that Courts will exercise a discretion in determining

whether or not decrees of specific performance should be made. They will not, of

course, be issued where it is impossible for the defendant to comply with them. And

there are many cases in which justice between the parties can be fully and

conveniently done by an award of damages. But that is a different thing from

saying that a defendant who has broken his undertaking has the option to purge

his default by the payment of money. For in the words of Storey (Equity

Jurisprudence, Sec. 717 (a)), “it is against conscience that a party should have a

right of election whether he would perform his contract or only pay damages for

the breach of it.” The election is rather with the injured party, subject to the

discretion of the Court.”

In accordance with the discretionary nature of the remedy of specific performance in the

law of South Africa, a Court may refuse to order specific performance where compliance

with the order would be impossible [Rissik v. Pretoria Municipal Council 1907 TS 1024,

1037; Shakinovsky v. Lawson and Smulowitz 1904 TS 326; Wheeldon v. Moldenhauer

1910 EDL 97, 99; Pretoria East Builders CC v. Basson 2004 6 SA 15 (SCA) 21], cause undue

hardship [Haynes v. Kingwilliamstown Municipality 1951 2 SA 371(A) 378H-9A; Dithaba

Platinum (Pvt) Ltd. v. Erronovaal Ltd. 1985 4 SA 615 (T) 6271-6281; SAPDC (Trading) Ltd

v. Immelman 1989 3 SA 506 (W) 512C-D], contracts for personal service [National Union

of Textile Workers and Others v. Stag Packings (Pty) Ltd. and Another 1982 4 SA 151 (T);

Seloadi and Others v. Sun International (Bophuthatswana) Ltd. 1993 2 SA 174 (BG) 1861-

190E; Santos Professional Football Club (Pty) Ltd v. Igesund 2003 5 SA 73(C) 78-81] or

where the obligations are imprecise [Douglas v. Baynes 1908 TS 1207 (PC); Breveton and

Upton v. Carnarvon Syndicate (1889) 10 NLR 166, 169; Lucerne Asbestos Co. Ltd. v.

Page 12 of 18

Becker 1928 WLD 311, 331; Barker vs. Beckett & Co. Ltd. 1911 TPD 151; Marais v. Cloete

1945 EDL 238, 242-243].

The remedy of specific performance is part of our law. In Holmes v. Alia Marikar (1 NLR

282 at 285), Withers, J. explained the concept as follows:

“The right specifically to compel a person to give something which he has promised

to give, or to do something which he has promised to do, has been frequently

recognized and given effect to in our Courts. If the thing cannot be given or done,

then its equivalent, id quod creditoris interest praestationem fieri, is exacted. The

present is a common case in our Courts. It has been before the Supreme Court since

1837.”

Accordingly, a party ready and willing to perform their contractual obligations has a prima

facie legal right to specific performance against the other party, subject only to the

discretion of the Court in the interests of justice.

I will first address questions of law Nos. 1 and 2 as an answer in the negative must

necessarily result in the dismissal of the appeal.

Question of Law Nos. 1 and 2

These two questions are interconnected and will be considered together. Admittedly the

Appellant has not deposited the balance part of the purchase price in Court prior to the

institution of this action.

Let me begin my analysis by examining whether it was incumbent on the Appellant to do

so.

It is trite law that the party seeking to enforce the contract must be ready and willing to

perform his part of the bargain [See Thaheer v. Abdeen (57 NLR 1 at 3); Noorul Asin and

Other v. Podinona de Zoysa and Others (1989) 1 Sri L. R. 63; T.T.P. Anthony Fernando vs.

Page 13 of 18

H. D. Felix Nevill Tirimanne and Others (S.C. Appeal No.244/2014, S.C.M. 16.06.2022 at

page 11].

A plaintiff who has failed to perform his obligation, which is conditional to requiring the

defendant to perform his obligation, will not be granted the remedy of specific

performance. The civil law recognized this principle through the exceptio non adimpleti

contractus (“exception of non-performance of contract”) which was available against a

party claiming performance who had himself not performed [Voet 19.1.23].

In BK Tooling (Edms) Bpk v. Scope Precision Engineering (Edms) Bpk [1979 (1) SA 391

(A)] it was held that, in the case of contract which imposes reciprocal obligations on the

parties, the plaintiff is entitled to specific performance only if he has in fact made

performance of his own obligations, or if he is able and prepared to do so: otherwise, his

claim will be repelled by the exception non adimpleti contarctus.

In Tirimanne and Others v. Theobald (46 NLR 391), the plaintiffs were entitled under a

contract, to claim from the defendant, on payment of Rs. 6,325 on or before February 8,

1940, the reconveyance of certain property which had been transferred to the defendant

by the 1st plaintiff. The plaintiffs alleged that on February 6, 1940, they tendered to the

defendant the sum of Rs. 6,325 in cash which the defendant did not receive. They

instituted action on February 7, 1940, for specific performance of the agreement to

reconvey, but did not bring the money into Court until January 23, 1941, the day before

the date fixed for the hearing of the action. The Privy Council held, that the failure of the

plaintiffs to bring the money into Court with the plaint was a very serious omission.

The reasoning of the Privy Council does not show per se an examination of the relevant

principles of Roman-Dutch law. Nevertheless, it is a fundamental legal principle in Roman-

Dutch law that the party seeking to enforce a contract must be ready and willing to

perform his part of the bargain. This necessarily leads to the conclusion that a party

seeking to obtain specific performance of a contractual stipulation which is conditional

Page 14 of 18

upon the payment of a sum of money, must bring the amount due to Court and deposit

it to the credit of the action at the time of filing the plaint.

Imposing such a requirement certainly meets the interest of justice. In addition to the

principle that a party seeking to obtain specific performance must be willing and able to

perform his part of the bargain, it ensures that a defendant is not dragged through a time

consuming and costly litigation only to find at the end of the trial that the plaintiff is not

in a position to perform his part of the bargain which is conditional to the obligation of

the defendant.

The parties clearly were aware of this principle and took the further step of incorporating

it as part of the terms and conditions agreed between them.

Clause 6 of the agreement to sell (P5) reads as follows:

"ඉහත කී, ගැණුම්කාර සමාගම අොළ දේපළ මිළදී ගැනීමට ඉදිරිපත් වන විට

විකුණුම්කරුවන් එකී දේපළ විකිණීම ප්‍රික්දෂ්ප කරයි නම්, දහෝ පැහැර හරි නම්, ඉතිරි

මුදල නිසි අධිකරණයේ තැන්පත් කර යෙෙ ගිවිසුෙ නිරූපිත යලස ඉටුකරවා ගැනීයේ

හිමිකෙ ගැනුම්කරුවන් සමග සතු බව විකුණුම්කරුවන් දමයින් පිළිගනී." (emphasis

added)

This is a clear expression of the intention of the parties that, the Appellant has the right

to seek specific performance of the agreement to sell only upon depositing the balance

amount due in Court. The Court must give effect to their express intention.

In Ginthota Sarukkale Vitharanage Hemalatha Piyathilake v. Wicrama Pathiranage

Mahesh Ruwan Pathirana [S.C. Appeal No: 218/2014, S.C.M. 15.02.2017 pages 9-10]

Sisira J. De Abrew J. held as follows:

“When taking a decision whether to grant relief or not in a case of breach of

contract it is necessary to examine the intention of the parties at the time that

they signed the agreement. In the present case what was the intention of the

Page 15 of 18

Defendant-Appellant when she signed the agreement? In finding an answer to this

question it must be remembered that the Defendant-Appellant, at the time of

signing the agreement, accepted a cheque for Rs.1.0 Million from the Plaintiff-

Respondent and that she signed the agreement knowing that there is a clause for

specific performance. Thus it is clear that the intention of the Defendant-Appellant

had been, at the time of signing the agreement, to sell the property to the Plaintiff-

Respondent. What was the intention of the Plaintiff-Respondent at the time of

signing the agreement? It has to be noted here that he gave a cheque for Rs.1.0

Million to the Defendant-Appellant and signed the agreement knowing that there

was a clause relating to specific performance. Thus his intention had been, at the

time of signing the agreement, to purchase the property. Thus it is clear that the

intention of both parties, at the time of signing of the agreement, was to implement

Agreement to Sell marked P1. What was the purpose of including a clause for

specific performance? The purpose, it appears, had been that both parties would

be compelled to fulfill their obligations.” (emphasis added)

Similarly, where parties have agreed that specific performance can be sought only upon

the balance sum payable being deposited in court, that must be enforced by Court.

In order to overcome this difficulty, the Appellant sought to contend that no issue was

raised on the need to make the deposit in Court.

Paragraph 14 of the plaint filed by the Appellant in the District Court of Avissawella

identifies the, the first cause of action as follows:

Issues and admissions were recorded on 13.08.2008. There were 7 admissions and 15

issues. Admission 5 is as follows:

"5. ඉහත කී 2378 ෙරණ ගිවිසුදම් දකාන්දේසි අනුගමනය කිරීමට දෙපාර්ශවය බැඳී සිටින

බේ පිලිගනියි."

The Respondents raised another issue after commencing the leading of evidences of the

Appellant. It was that since the Appellant has failed to deposit the balance consideration

to the credit of the case in accordance with the Clause 6 of the sales agreement, can the

Appellant have and maintain this action?

Subsequently, there was a correction made to that issue which then read:

"16. පැමිණිලිකාර සමාගම අංක 1378 ෙරණ ගිවිසුදම් 6 වන දකාන්දේසිය පරිදි ඉිරි මුෙල

ෙැනටමත් දමම නඩුවට තැන්පත් කර නැි දහයින් දමම නඩුව පවරා පවත්වා දගන යා

හැකිෙ?"

The Appellant called the manager of the Appellant’s company and Mr. Athula

Walisundera, Attorney-at-Law and Notary in Public to testify on its behalf. The manager

has been cross examined regarding depositing the money. It has been recorded at pages

107-108 of the Appeal Brief as follows:

“ප්‍ර. (6 දවනි දකාන්දේසිය බලන්න) තමාට ඒ දකාන්දේසිය අනුව විත්ිකරුවන් දමම

It is in this context the learned trial judge answered issue no.16 in negative and concluded

that the Appellant has failed to deposit the balance amount due in Court. This is the

correct conclusion on the facts and circumstances of this action.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer question of law No. 1 and 2 in the negative.

In the foregoing circumstances, there is no need to answer the other questions of law and

the appeal must be dismissed.

Page 18 of 18

In summary, the following facts are established:

• Clause 6 of the agreement to sell expressly grants the Appellant the right to seek

specific performance.

• Before exercising that right, the Appellant is required to deposit the balance

amount in Court.

• The Appellant failed to deposit the said balance amount in Court as stipulated in

the agreement to sell.

• Therefore, the Appellant cannot seek specific performance.

I affirm the judgment of the District Court of Avissawella dated 03.11.2010 and the

judgment of the High Court dated 31.03.2015.

Appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 1,00,000/=.
