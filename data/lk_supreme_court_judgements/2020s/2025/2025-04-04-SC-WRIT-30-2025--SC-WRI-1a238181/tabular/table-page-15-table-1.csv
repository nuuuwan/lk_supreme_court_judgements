"","form set out in the First Schedule of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, No. 53 of"

"4.","SC Writ No. 30/25 also relates to compliance with form set out in the First Schedule of"
"","the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance, No. 53 of 1946. In this case, the Petitioner has"
"","not identified the youth candidates with the prescribed demarcation ‘Y’. The nomination"
"","paper has been rejected as it did not identify the required number of youth candidates."
"5.","SC  Writ  No.  38/25  relates  column  8  of  the  First  Schedule.  In  the  said  matter,  a  male"
"","candidate was identified as a female candidate. Thereafter, the entire nomination paper"
"","had been rejected on the basis that the minimum number of women candidates had not"
"","been met. However, the learned President’s Counsel submitted that, inadvertently, a male"
"","candidate was identified as female whereas another female candidate was identified as"
"","male. Therefore, he submitted that the nomination paper complied with the minimum"
"","number of women candidates required. As the reasonability of this decision to reject the"
"","paper is one that relates to facts of that individual case, I see no need to consider the"
"","merits of the same"
"6.","In any event, as the preliminary objection affects all writ matters, I shall first reproduce"
"","the findings of the Court in that regard for ease of reference."
