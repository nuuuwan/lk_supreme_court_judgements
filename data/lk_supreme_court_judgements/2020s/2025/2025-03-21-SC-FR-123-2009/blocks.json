There had been an exchange of words between the 1st Peoner and the Ocer of the Civil Defence Force who was on duty at the entrance to the Police Staon with regard to the place where the Peoner could park his vehicle. The 1st Peoner states that he thereaer met the 12th Respondent, who was the Ocer-in-Charge of Administraon who had directed another ocer to provide the 1st Peoner with a copy of such complaint. Thus, at this point of me, there is no complaint by the 1st Peoner that the Respondents interfered with and/or obstructed him in aending to his professional dues as an Aorney-at-Law. As the 1st Peoner had been requested to stay half an hour to collect the statement, the 1st Peoner states that he le the building with a view of coming back later to collect the said statement. The 1st Peoner states that on his way out, he was accosted by the 13th Respondent, who, having blocked his pathway, threatened the Peoner with death and dealt a severe blow on the le shoulder of the 1st Peoner. While this version of the 1st Peoner has been denied by the 13th Respondent, the 1st Peoner does not state what may have triggered this sudden erupon on the part of the 13th Respondent nor does the 1st Peoner claim that the 13th Respondent bore any grudge towards him as a result of the 1st Peoner having appeared against ocers aached to the Negombo Police Staon. This is the rst incident that the 1st Peoner has complained of to this Court, with the 1st Peoner claiming that the 13th Respondent violated his fundamental rights guaranteed by Arcle 11. The 1st Peoner states that he immediately visited the oce of the 12th Respondent and informed him of such assault and demanded that acon be taken by the 12th Respondent. While he was talking to the 12th Respondent, the 1st Peoner states that the 13th Respondent entered the oce of the 12th Respondent and hit him twice on his le wrist. In spite of having seen such incident, the 1st Peoner claims that the 12th Respondent ignored the above incident and refused to take any acon relang to the rst incident. This is the second incident that has been complained of by the 1st Peoner to this Court. The 1st Peoner claims that the said acon of the 13th Respondent is a violaon of his fundamental rights guaranteed by Arcle 11 and that the failure of the 12th Respondent",

The 1st Peoner had lodged a wrien complaint in respect of the above two incidents with the 1st Respondent, the Inspector General of Police on the very next date [P8] where the 1st Peoner had reiterated the enre incident. While a formal inquiry had been held by the 2nd Respondent into such complaint, it is the posion of the 2nd Respondent that in spite of several messages having been sent to the 1st Peoner to be present for an inquiry, the 1st Peoner did not respond resulng in the inquiry not being proceeded with. The third and nal incident that has been complained of to this Court took place on 30th January 2009. The Peoners state that they were at their oce situated next to their residence at Ragama ll about 10.30pm that night and had just returned to their residence when they observed that their oce was on re. The Peoners state further that all eorts taken by them and their neighbours to douse the re had been unsuccessful and that the enre oce building together with all valuables were completely destroyed by the re. The Peoners have not produced any independent evidence as to who the perpetrators of the said incident may have been nor do they make any specic allegaon against any person/s. The Peoners however claim that they verily believe that the re was a meculously planned and well-coordinated aack and was the culminaon of a series of incidents to prevent the 1st Peoner from engaging in his professional dues. The Peoners state that a complaint with regard to the re was lodged at 11.50pm that night at the Ragama Police Staon and that the 1st Peoner visited the said Police Staon at around noon the next date. The Peoners state that while Ocers from the Ragama Police Staon visited the scene of the incident on 31st January 2009 and 1st February 2009, a formal visit by ocers aached to the Peliyagoda Police Staon was done only on 2nd February 2009. The Peoners state that no further acon has been taken by the Police Department thereaer. The inacon on the part of the Police in invesgang the said complaint and the impact that such failure had on the right of the Peoners to engage in their professional dues as Aorneys-at-Law is the third complaint by the Peoners to this Court. This complaint involves a violaon of the fundamental rights of the Peoners guaranteed by Arcles 12(1) and 14(1)(g).",

It was observed [at page 106] that where physical harm is concerned, a long line of cases had adopted the criteria set out in Mrs. W M K De Silva v Chairman, Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation [supra; at page 401], that for there to be an Article 11 infringement, the degree of mental or physical coerciveness or viciousness must be such as to occasion not mere ill-treatment, but maltreatment of a very high degree.

By Rule No. 3 it was stated that No ocer of the Police Force shall in any manner or circumstances whatsoever, use, physical force, abusive language or resort to any other intermediary conduct in respect of any person. Regarding the treatment of Aorneys-at-Law who may enter such place for the purpose of represenng and/or watching the interests of their clients who are suspects or otherwise, it was stated by Rule No. 1 that their right to represent their clients should be fully recognized. Rule No. 2 required that every ocer of the Police Force shall at all mes, treat such Aorney-at-Law within the above-menoned places cordially, and courteously, and shall aord to such Aorney-at-Law all reasonable assistance during the course thereof. Any ocer who acts in violaon of those rules, or aids and abets the violaon of those rules is to be dealt with severely, according to the available procedures and may be liable to any other disciplinary inquiry/proceedings and punive sancons.

Silva, Aorney General and another [(1998) 1 Sri LR 340; at page 349], Mark Fernando, J stated that, A cizen is entled to a proper invesgaon - one which is fair, competent, mely and appropriate - of a criminal complaint, whether it be by him or against him. The criminal law exists for the protecon of his rights - of person, property and reputaon - and lack of a due invesgaon will deprive him of the protecon of the law. [emphasis added] Whether inacon by law enforcement authories can amount to a violaon of Arcle 12(1) was considered by this Court in Faiz v Aorney General and others [(1995) 1 Sri LR 372]. In that case, the complaint of the peoner was that the 2nd 4th respondents who were ocers aached to the Polonnaruwa Police Staon failed to prevent the 6th respondent, a Parliamentarian represenng the Polonnaruwa District, from assaulng the peoner, failed to make any endeavour to apprehend the suspects or to take any further steps under the law or even to record the statement of the peoner that he had been assaulted by the 6th respondent inside the police staon.

[emphasis added] Perera, J went on to state [at page 403] that, It is true that a denial of equal protecon has hitherto been largely conned to armave acts of discriminaon. The view that culpable, ocial state inacon may also constute a denial of equal protecon has now been recognized by the United States Supreme Court as well. In Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority et al ([1961] 345 US 715) Jusce Clark delivering the opinion of the Court, observed thus \"by its inacon the Authority and through it the state, has not only made itself a party to the refusal of service but has elected to place its power property and presge behind the admied discriminaon.\" In Lynch v. USA (5th CIR 1951) the Federal Court of Appeal stated the opinion thus, \"there was a me when the denial of equal protecon of the law was conned to armave acts, but the law now is that culpable ocial inacon may also constute a denial of equal protecon.

Illangakoon and others [SC (FR) Applicaon No 372/2015; SC Minutes of 17th November 2017], the complaint of the peoners was the failure by the Police to expediously prosecute the case against the suspect before the Magistrates Court of Moratuwa or in other words inacon by the police ocers who invesgated into the said oence to prosecute the oender. Even though the Magistrate directed that the maer be referred to the Aorney General for his advice it took the Police over a year to comply with such order. Malalgoda, PC, J held that the said inacon amounts to the violaon of the equal protecon guaranteed under Arcle 12(1) of the Constuon. I shall now consider whether the Peoners right to the equal protecon of the law guaranteed by Arcle 12(1) has been infringed by the failure of the Police to take acon on his complaint that his oce was set on re. The 11th Respondent served as the Ocer-in-Charge of the Ragama Police Staon at the relevant me, and was acng in the course of the ocial funcons assigned to him at all mes relevant to this applicaon.
