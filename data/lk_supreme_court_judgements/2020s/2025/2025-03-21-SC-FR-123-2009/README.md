Obeyesekere, J The Peoners led this applicaon on 26th February 2009 complaining that their fundamental rights guaranteed under Arcles 11, 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constuon have been violated by the Respondents. Leave to proceed for the alleged infringement of the said Arcles by the Respondents was granted on 5th March 2009. Facts in brief The 1st Peoner is an Aorney-at-Law primarily engaged as a praconer in the High Courts of Colombo, Negombo and Gampaha and the Magistrates Court of Negombo. The 2nd Peoner is also an Aorney-at-Law and is the wife of the 1st Peoner. The 1st Peoner states that since 2004, he has represented ligants who have been subjected to unlawful arrest and torture by the Police. He states that his professional services have been retained by many civil society and non-governmental organisaons including an organisaon by the name of Right to Life Human Rights Centre at Katunayake [the Centre]. The 1st Peoner has stated further that he has served as the Legal Consultant of the Centre from 2007 and had connued to represent a large of number of underprivileged persons who had been subjected to physical abuse and harassment by the Police. The 1st Peoner states that one such person he represented was Anton Sugath Nishantha Fernando who it is alleged had been brutally assaulted by ocers aached to the Negombo Police, and in respect of which assault Fundamental Rights Applicaon No. 446/2007 had been instuted. The said Nishantha Fernando had been killed on 20th September 2008 by unidened gunmen. The Peoners state that while no arrests have been made in that regard, the Centre had received a message on 24th September 2008 threatening the 1st Peoner with death if he connued to look aer the interests of the said Nishantha Fernando. The Peoners have stated further that the Centre had formally lodged a complaint with the Headquarters Inspector of the Negombo Police in that regard on 26th September 2008 [P4a]. The said complaint does not form part of the subject maer of this applicaon.

6

On 27th January 2009, the 1st Peoner had visited the Negombo Police Staon to obtain a copy of a complaint that had been made by the wife of Nishantha Fernando over the loss of her identy card. There had been an exchange of words between the 1st Peoner and the Ocer of the Civil Defence Force who was on duty at the entrance to the Police Staon with regard to the place where the Peoner could park his vehicle. The 1st Peoner states that he thereaer met the 12th Respondent, who was the Ocer-in-Charge of Administraon who had directed another ocer to provide the 1st Peoner with a copy of such complaint. Thus, at this point of me, there is no complaint by the 1st Peoner that the Respondents interfered with and/or obstructed him in aending to his professional dues as an Aorney-at-Law. As the 1st Peoner had been requested to stay half an hour to collect the statement, the 1st Peoner states that he le the building with a view of coming back later to collect the said statement. The 1st Peoner states that on his way out, he was accosted by the 13th Respondent, who, having blocked his pathway, threatened the Peoner with death and dealt a severe blow on the le shoulder of the 1st Peoner. While this version of the 1st Peoner has been denied by the 13th Respondent, the 1st Peoner does not state what may have triggered this sudden erupon on the part of the 13th Respondent nor does the 1st Peoner claim that the 13th Respondent bore any grudge towards him as a result of the 1st Peoner having appeared against ocers aached to the Negombo Police Staon. This is the rst incident that the 1st Peoner has complained of to this Court, with the 1st Peoner claiming that the 13th Respondent violated his fundamental rights guaranteed by Arcle 11. The 1st Peoner states that he immediately visited the oce of the 12th Respondent and informed him of such assault and demanded that acon be taken by the 12th Respondent. While he was talking to the 12th Respondent, the 1st Peoner states that the 13th Respondent entered the oce of the 12th Respondent and hit him twice on his le wrist. In spite of having seen such incident, the 1st Peoner claims that the 12th Respondent ignored the above incident and refused to take any acon relang to the rst incident. This is the second incident that has been complained of by the 1st Peoner to this Court. The 1st Peoner claims that the said acon of the 13th Respondent is a violaon of his fundamental rights guaranteed by Arcle 11 and that the failure of the 12th Respondent

7

to take acon against the 13th Respondent is a violaon of his fundamental rights guaranteed by Arcle 12(1). The 1st Peoner had lodged a wrien complaint in respect of the above two incidents with the 1st Respondent, the Inspector General of Police on the very next date [P8] where the 1st Peoner had reiterated the enre incident. While a formal inquiry had been held by the 2nd Respondent into such complaint, it is the posion of the 2nd Respondent that in spite of several messages having been sent to the 1st Peoner to be present for an inquiry, the 1st Peoner did not respond resulng in the inquiry not being proceeded with. The third and nal incident that has been complained of to this Court took place on 30th January 2009. The Peoners state that they were at their oce situated next to their residence at Ragama ll about 10.30pm that night and had just returned to their residence when they observed that their oce was on re. The Peoners state further that all eorts taken by them and their neighbours to douse the re had been unsuccessful and that the enre oce building together with all valuables were completely destroyed by the re. The Peoners have not produced any independent evidence as to who the perpetrators of the said incident may have been nor do they make any specic allegaon against any person/s. The Peoners however claim that they verily believe that the re was a meculously planned and well-coordinated aack and was the culminaon of a series of incidents to prevent the 1st Peoner from engaging in his professional dues. The Peoners state that a complaint with regard to the re was lodged at 11.50pm that night at the Ragama Police Staon and that the 1st Peoner visited the said Police Staon at around noon the next date. The Peoners state that while Ocers from the Ragama Police Staon visited the scene of the incident on 31st January 2009 and 1st February 2009, a formal visit by ocers aached to the Peliyagoda Police Staon was done only on 2nd February 2009. The Peoners state that no further acon has been taken by the Police Department thereaer. The inacon on the part of the Police in invesgang the said complaint and the impact that such failure had on the right of the Peoners to engage in their professional dues as Aorneys-at-Law is the third complaint by the Peoners to this Court. This complaint involves a violaon of the fundamental rights of the Peoners guaranteed by Arcles 12(1) and 14(1)(g).

Arcle 11 and 12(1) the rst and second incidents I shall commence by considering the aforemenoned rst and second incidents together as both incidents formed part of one transacon. As pointed out by Atukorale, J in Amal Sudath Silva v Kodituwakku, Inspector of Police and Others [(1987) 2 Sri LR 119; at page 126], Arcle 11 of our Constuon mandates that no person shall be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It prohibits every person from inicng torturesome, cruel or inhuman treatment on another. It is an absolute fundamental right subject to no restricons or limitaons whatsoever. [emphasis added] In Mrs. W M K De Silva v Chairman, Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation [(1989) 2 Sri LR 393], Amerasinghe, J stated [at page 405] that:

In my view Arcle 11 of the Constuon prohibits any act by which severe pain or suering, whether physical or mental is, without lawful sancon in accordance with a procedure established by law, intenonally inicted on a person (whom I shall refer to as 'the vicm) by a public ocial acng in the discharge of his execuve or administrave dues or under colour of oce, for such purposes as obtaining from the vicm or a third person a confession or informaon, such informaon being actually or supposedly required for ocial purposes, imposing a penalty upon the vicm for an oence or breach or a rule he or a third person has commied or is suspected of having commied, or inmidang or coercing the vicm or a third person to do or refrain from doing something which the ocial concerned believes the vicm or the third person ought to do or refrain from doing, as the case may be. [emphasis added] In Hettiarachchige Gemunu Tissa v Jayaratne, Sub Inspector of Police and others [SC (FR) Application No. 417/2016; SC minutes of 28th May 2024] , it was stated that, Every human being is entitled to live in dignity and not be subject to any torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is the duty of this Court, as the guardian of the fundamental rights of our People, to foster and protect these rights. Whenever a complaint alleging the infringement of Article 11 is made to this Court, our duty is to

9

examine carefully the facts relating to such complaint, the corroborative evidence, if any, tendered by the petitioner in support of such complaint, the version of the respondent/s and arrive at a considered decision. It was pointed out by Amerasinghe, J in Channa Pieris and others v Attorney General and others (Ratawesi Peramuna Case) [(1994) 1 Sri LR 1; at page 105] that in considering any allegation of a violation of Article 11, the acts or conduct complained of must be qualitatively of a kind that the Court can take cognizance of. It was observed [at page 106] that where physical harm is concerned, a long line of cases had adopted the criteria set out in Mrs. W M K De Silva v Chairman, Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation [supra; at page 401], that for there to be an Article 11 infringement, the degree of mental or physical coerciveness or viciousness must be such as to occasion not mere ill-treatment, but maltreatment of a very high degree. Bearing the above in mind, I shall now re-visit the factual maers as pleaded by the pares. The fact that, (a) the 1st Peoner visited the Negombo Police Staon on 27th January 2009, (b) the 1st Peoner got into an argument with the ocer of the Civil Defence Force on duty at the entrance to the Police Staon over the locaon where he could park his vehicle, and (c) there was an argument between the 1st Peoner and the 13th Respondent inside the Police Staon in respect of the said incident are borne out by the notes maintained by PC 33287 Dharshana [12R2], the 12th Respondent [12R6] and the 13th Respondent [12R7]. I have very carefully examined the said notes in the light of the narraon of the 1st Peoner and observe the following maers: (a) As admied by the 1st Peoner, an incident occurred prior to the 1st Peoner

entering the Police Staon. The said incident was however resolved, at least for the me being, by the 1st Peoner parking his vehicle at a dierent locaon; (b) The 1st Peoners request for a copy of the statement made by the wife of

Nishantha Fernando had been allowed and the 1st Peoner was asked to stay half an hour to collect the said statement;

10

(c) The Respondents have not obstructed the 1st Peoner in carrying out and/or discharging his professional dues as an Aorney-at-Law; (d) Having come out of the Police Staon, the 1st Peoner had again got entangled over

the parking issue with the Ocer on duty at the entrance at which point the 13th Respondent had come to the defence of the said Ocer; (e) The 1st Peoner got into an argument with the 13th Respondent in the mistaken

belief that the 13th Respondent was a respondent in the fundamental rights applicaon led by Nishantha Fernando; (f) The 13th Respondent is alleging that the 1st Peoner was under the inuence of alcohol and had threatened the ocers present that he will ensure that disciplinary acon is taken against the 13th Respondent and other ocers. The Respondents have of course denied that they assaulted the 1st Peoner. In Hondamuni Chandima and another v Inspector Malaweera, Police Staon, Ambalangoda and others [SC (FR) Applicaon No. 242/2010; SC minutes of 30th April 2021] Aluwihare, PC, J stated as follows:

Arcle 12 (1) spulates that everyone is equal before the law and is entled to the equal protecon of the law. It needs no reiteraon that the primary responsibility of upholding these fundamental protecons lies with the State. As reminded over and over again by this Court, police ocers, being state ocers tasked with law enforcement and the maintenance of law and order have an utmost responsibility in respecng, safeguarding and advancing these rights. Police ocers are expected to extend common courtesies at all mes when dealing with the public. The identy or the status of the person whom the police is dealing with should have no bearing whatsoever on the fair and courteous treatment that they are entled to, as of right. Police ocers are bound to treat every person with dignity and respect. [emphasis added]

11

The fricon between Police Ocers and Aorneys-at-Law who visit Police Staons to aend to their professional dues has been the subject maer of much ligaon over the years. In the above case, Aluwihare, PC, J went on to refer in the following manner to an amicable resoluon reached before this Court of such issues:

In D. W. C. Moho v. Upul Seneviratne, OIC, Bambalapiya and Others, (SC FR 527/08 SC minutes 27. 04. 2009) which involved an incident where an Aorney-at-Law was obstructed by a police ocer in represenng his client at the police staon, a selement was reached between the pares. The terms of the selement were to the eect that the IGP would issue formal rules under Secon 55 of the Police Ordinance delineang the manner in which the police should interact with persons at police staons, police headquarters and/or any other permanent unit, base, post or such like that have been established by the Sri Lanka Police. By Rule No. 3 it was stated that No ocer of the Police Force shall in any manner or circumstances whatsoever, use, physical force, abusive language or resort to any other intermediary conduct in respect of any person. Regarding the treatment of Aorneys-at-Law who may enter such place for the purpose of represenng and/or watching the interests of their clients who are suspects or otherwise, it was stated by Rule No. 1 that their right to represent their clients should be fully recognized. Rule No. 2 required that every ocer of the Police Force shall at all mes, treat such Aorney-at-Law within the above-menoned places cordially, and courteously, and shall aord to such Aorney-at-Law all reasonable assistance during the course thereof. Any ocer who acts in violaon of those rules, or aids and abets the violaon of those rules is to be dealt with severely, according to the available procedures and may be liable to any other disciplinary inquiry/proceedings and punive sancons. Although the present case was anterior to the publicaon of the Police (Appearance of Aorneys-at-Law at Police Staons) Rules, 2012 in Gazee Extraordinary No. 1758/36 of 18. 05. 2012 which provided guidelines to the Police regarding interacng with Aorneys-at-Law within the precincts of police staons, the rules agreed upon in the Moho case (supra) would be applicable to the present case. In my view the Rules referred to have only restated the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constuon and referred to them expansively with the objecve of enlightening the

12

police ocers of the need to respect Fundamental Rights. The eect of the said rules is that every person who enters a police staon or similar premises should be treated with dignity and politeness by the police. Aorneys-at-Law who represent the interests of their clients and act in the exercise of their professional dues too are entled to courteous and proacve treatment. Needless to say, even in the absence of any binding rules, these are basic human decencies any public servant owes a fellow cizen, in their interacons. Police ocers are required to take extra care in the discharge of their dues in view of the fact that they are endowed with coercive powers to perform their funcons. [emphasis added] A similar incident occurred in Ratnayaka Weerakoonge Sandya Kumari v Lakshitha Weerasinghe and others [SC (FR) Applicaon No. 75/2012; SC Minutes of 18th December 2019]. The peoner, a lady Aorney-at-Law complained that she was abused and harassed inside the Meegahatenna Police Staon by the Ocer-in-Charge when she went to surrender a suspect who was wanted on an allegaon of rape. Having weighed the evidence produced, this Court was inclined to accept the narraon given by the 1st and 2nd respondents that the peoner created a commoon at the police staon. Murdu Fernando, PC, J [as she then was] went on to state that:

Another factor that should be borne in mind is that the oce of an Aorney at-Law is also governed by the Supreme Court (Conduct of and Equee for Aorneys-at-Law) Rules of 1988 where it is specically stated that an Aorney at-Law must not conduct herself in any manner which would be reasonably regarded as unworthy, disgraceful and dishonorable by Aorney-at-Law of good repute. When analysing the behavior of the peoner and the 1st respondent based on the adavits led before Court, I am reminded of the o quoted saying that, courtesy begets courtesy. Taking into consideraon (a) the two conicng versions of the 1st Peoner on the one hand and the Respondents on the other with regard to the alleged assault of the 1st Peoner by the 13th Respondent, and (b) the nature of the complaint before this Court, I am unable to conclude that the incidents complained of by the 1st Peoner sases the test laid down Mrs. W M K De Silva v Chairman, Ceylon Ferlizer Corporaon [supra].

13

What is clear to my mind however is that the enre incident was triggered by the distrust and the dislike that the 1st Peoner had towards the ocers of the Negombo Police Staon arising from the alleged torture of Nishantha Fernando, and possibly other incidents involving ocers of the Negombo Police Staon. This led to an insignicant issue of the 1st Peoner being unable to park at a place of his choice being blown out of proporon. It is clear that both pares failed to act with restraint and with respect towards each other. Just as much as Police Ocers must act with courtesy to all those vising a police staon, an Aorney-at-Law must also bear in mind that he or she cannot use his or her professional status and privilege to impose unnecessary demands on those serving in a Police Staon. I am therefore of the view that the 1st Peoner has failed to discharge the burden cast on him to establish that the rst and second incidents complained of to this Court has resulted in a violaon of his fundamental rights guaranteed by Arcles 11 and 12(1). Arcles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) the third incident This brings me to the third incident complained of by the Peoners. It is admied by the Respondents that the oce premises of the 1st Peoner was destroyed by re and that the 1st Peoner complained to the Ragama Police Staon of such incident. A cizen of this Country is entled in terms of the law to make a complaint to law enforcement authories of the commission of an oence and is equally entled to have such complaint invesgated in accordance with the applicable law in a fair, independent and transparent manner. This posion is clearly set out in Secon 109(5)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, as amended, which provides as follows:

If from informaon received or otherwise, an ocer in charge of the police staon or inquirer has reason to suspect the commission of any oence, he shall himself make an invesgaon or authorize the making of an invesgaon under this Chapter in the manner hereinaer set out:

14

Provided however, if the oence is a cognizable oence or he has reason to apprehend a breach of the peace, he shall, in the case of every inquirer, forthwith submit a report to the Magistrate's Court having jurisdicon in respect of such oence and in the case of an ocer in charge of the police staon, forthwith submit a report to his own immediate superior and proceed in person to the spot to invesgate the facts and circumstances of the case and to take such measures as may be necessary for the immediate discovery and arrest of the oender; In Victor Ivon v Sarath N. Silva, Aorney General and another [(1998) 1 Sri LR 340; at page 349], Mark Fernando, J stated that, A cizen is entled to a proper invesgaon - one which is fair, competent, mely and appropriate - of a criminal complaint, whether it be by him or against him. The criminal law exists for the protecon of his rights - of person, property and reputaon - and lack of a due invesgaon will deprive him of the protecon of the law. [emphasis added] Whether inacon by law enforcement authories can amount to a violaon of Arcle 12(1) was considered by this Court in Faiz v Aorney General and others [(1995) 1 Sri LR 372]. In that case, the complaint of the peoner was that the 2nd 4th respondents who were ocers aached to the Polonnaruwa Police Staon failed to prevent the 6th respondent, a Parliamentarian represenng the Polonnaruwa District, from assaulng the peoner, failed to make any endeavour to apprehend the suspects or to take any further steps under the law or even to record the statement of the peoner that he had been assaulted by the 6th respondent inside the police staon. Perera, J observed [at page 402] that:

In this instance it is clear that the 2nd and 3rd respondents deliberately refrained from apprehending the suspects as they were entled to do in law. It was conceded by the Addional Solicitor General that up to date no plaint had been led by the police against the 5th, 6th and 7th respondents. While the respondent police ocers had taken acon with such astounding promptude against the peoner on the complaint of the 6th respondent of an aempt to cause hurt to him and had ensured that the peoner was remanded, no meaningful acon whatsoever has been taken against the 5th, 6th and 7th respondents who had commied such serious

15

oences inside the police staon itself up to date. I hold therefore that the peoner has established beyond doubt that his fundamental right guaranteed by Arcle 12(1) of the Constuon has been infringed by the 2nd and 3rd respondents by execuve or administrave acon. [emphasis added] Perera, J went on to state [at page 403] that, It is true that a denial of equal protecon has hitherto been largely conned to armave acts of discriminaon. The view that culpable, ocial state inacon may also constute a denial of equal protecon has now been recognized by the United States Supreme Court as well. In Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority et al ([1961] 345 US 715) Jusce Clark delivering the opinion of the Court, observed thus "by its inacon the Authority and through it the state, has not only made itself a party to the refusal of service but has elected to place its power property and presge behind the admied discriminaon." In Lynch v. USA (5th CIR 1951) the Federal Court of Appeal stated the opinion thus, "there was a me when the denial of equal protecon of the law was conned to armave acts, but the law now is that culpable ocial inacon may also constute a denial of equal protecon. [emphasis added] In M.W. Leelawathie Harriot Perera and others v N.K. Illangakoon and others [SC (FR) Applicaon No 372/2015; SC Minutes of 17th November 2017], the complaint of the peoners was the failure by the Police to expediously prosecute the case against the suspect before the Magistrates Court of Moratuwa or in other words inacon by the police ocers who invesgated into the said oence to prosecute the oender. Even though the Magistrate directed that the maer be referred to the Aorney General for his advice it took the Police over a year to comply with such order. Malalgoda, PC, J held that the said inacon amounts to the violaon of the equal protecon guaranteed under Arcle 12(1) of the Constuon. I shall now consider whether the Peoners right to the equal protecon of the law guaranteed by Arcle 12(1) has been infringed by the failure of the Police to take acon on his complaint that his oce was set on re. The 11th Respondent served as the Ocer-in-Charge of the Ragama Police Staon at the relevant me, and was acng in the course of the ocial funcons assigned to him at all mes relevant to this applicaon. Thus, the State is responsible for the acons of the 11th

16

Respondent. Even though the 11th Respondent ceased to hold oce upon his rerement from the Police Department and did not le an adavit, the 11th Respondent was represented by the Aorney General. I only have before me an adavit of the Ocer-in-Charge of the Ragama Police Staon who served in that oce in 2013. According to the said adavit, ocers of the Ragama Police Staon had visited the scene of the incident on 1st February 2009, and ocers of the Government Analyst Department are said to have visited the scene on 3rd February 2009. This Court has however not been apprised of what transpired as a result of such visits. Facts have been reported to the Gampaha Magistrates Court by the 11th Respondent on

the same date under Case No. B/343/2009 on the basis that the complaint discloses an

oence punishable under Secon 419 of the Penal Code. Thus, on the 11th Respondents

own admission, the provisions of Secon 109(5)(a) had been triggered. The 11th

Respondent was therefore under a legal duty to invesgate the facts and circumstances

of the case and to take such measures as may be necessary for the immediate discovery

and arrest of the oender.

I have examined the B report marked 11R1 and observe that other than (a) recording

the statement of the 1st Peoner, where the 1st Peoner had expressed his suspicion

that it was foul play especially in view of the previous incidents involving ocers of the

Negombo Police, and (b) ling 11R1, the 11th Respondent has not conducted any

invesgaon at all.

This is clearly borne out by the nal paragraph in 11R1, which reads as follows:

fuu isoaOsh iusnkaOfhka meusKs,a, igyka lsrSfuka miq jyd mrsCIK lghq;= wdrusN lr we;s w;r fuh .sks ;enSula ksid we;sjq .skaklao" tfia fkdue;skus jsoq,sh ldkaoq jsula isoqjqjlao hkak mrsCId lsrSu i|yd jsoq,s n, uKav,h" weifra ldrahd,h" ri mrsCIl ldrahd,h" jsfYaI fmd,sia wmrdO jsuraIK lKavdhus fj; oekqj;a lr wdod, ks,Odrska udra.fhka fuu .skak we;sjsug fya;=j fidhd n,d fuu isoaOsh iusnkaOfhka hus iellrejka isgSkus Tjqka w;awvx.=jg f.k .re wOslrKh fj; jdra:d lrk f;la fuu kvqj nyd ;nk fuka f.!rjfhka b,a,d isgsus'

17

Thus, even though the 11th Respondent speaks of assigning special police teams to

invesgate the complaint, the 11th Respondent has clearly demonstrated on the rst day

itself that he had no intenon at all in acng in terms of the law, invesgate the facts &

circumstances of the case and take such measures as may be necessary for the immediate

discovery and arrest of the oender/s. The 11th Respondent has openly engaged in an

absolute sham in derelicon of his statutory duty. There was simply no basis for the 11th

Respondent to move at the rst available opportunity to lay by the case, especially in view

of the aforesaid statement in 11R1.

That the complaint of the 1st Peoner was strangled and put to death on day one is

clearly evident when one considers that the adavit of the Ocer-in-Charge of the

Ragama Police Staon led over 4 years aer the incident does not disclose if any steps

were taken aer 3rd February 2009. Nor has the State apprised this Court the steps taken

by it even aer the ling of the said adavit. Sixteen years later and the complaint of the

1st Peoner that his oce was set on re has remained an unsolved crime.

It is indeed a very sad situaon as far as law enforcement in this Country is concerned if

Police Ocers are to adopt such a lackadaisical approach towards their statutory dues.

The complainants were Aorneys-at-Law who had the ability to come before this Court

and complain. It is not a privilege that a majority of the cizens of this Country can aord,

and I fear to think of what the posion might be of such majority.

It is not that I do not appreciate that it may not be possible to apprehend the oenders in

each and every complaint. However, it shall be the basic responsibility of a Police Ocer

to conduct a fair and imparal invesgaon without sabotaging the invesgaon at the

rst available opportunity. The seriousness of the acon of the 11th Respondent must be

viewed in the background of the allegaons levelled against the ocers of the Negombo

Police Staon to which I have referred to. As observed by Mark Fernando, J in Victor Ivon

v Sarath N. Silva, Aorney General and another [supra], the Peoners were certainly

entled to a proper invesgaon - one which is fair, competent, mely and

appropriate. I am therefore of the view that the inacon on the part of the 11th

Respondent who funconed as the Ocer-in-Charge of the Ragama Police Staon to

invesgate in terms of the law the complaint of the 1st Peoner has resulted in the

18

violaon of the fundamental rights of the Peoners guaranteed by Arcle 12(1) of the

Constuon.

I must for the sake of completeness state that although the damage to their oce would

have resulted in an obstrucon to the Peoners engaging in their professional dues as

Aorneys-at-Law, the Peoners have not placed any material to substanate their

posion that the failure to invesgate the said complaint prevented them from engaging

in their professional dues. Hence, I am not inclined to hold that the fundamental rights

of the Peoners guaranteed by Arcle 14(1)(g) have been infringed by any of the

Respondents.

Conclusion

In the above circumstances, I hold that the State must take responsibility for the inacon

of the 11th Respondent which has resulted in the violaon of the fundamental rights of

the Peoners guaranteed by Arcle 12(1). I therefore direct that the State pay a sum of

Rs. 50,000 as compensaon to each of the Peoners within three months hereof.

I make no order with regard to costs.
