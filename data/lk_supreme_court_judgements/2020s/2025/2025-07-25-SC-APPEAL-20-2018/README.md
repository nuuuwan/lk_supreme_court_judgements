Decided on: 25.07.2025

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

1. This matter arises from an appeal against the judgment dated 28th

February 2017 of the Civil Appellate High Court of the Western

Province, whereby the decision of the learned Additional District

Judge of Colombo delivered on 8th August 2013 in Case No.

DSP/260/2012 was set aside, and the application of the Petitioner

Bank was dismissed.

P a g e 5 | 8

2. The 1st and 2nd Respondents obtained loan facilities amounting to

Rs. 400,000/- and Rs. 1,000,000/- respectively from the Petitioner

Bank in 1996 and 1998. As security, they executed Mortgage Bonds

over certain immovable property. Upon default of payment, the

Petitioner Bank lawfully exercised its statutory right under Act No.

32 of 1986 (as amended), to auction the said property. As no third-

party bidders came forward at the public auction held on

21.04.2008, the Bank purchased the said property on a Certificate

of Sale.

3. Despite the issuance of the Certificate of Sale, the Respondents

failed to yield vacant possession, compelling the Bank to file an

action in the District Court of Colombo seeking possession.

Although an earlier application (DSP/74/2010) was dismissed on

the ground that the original Certificate of Sale had not been

produced, a fresh application (DSP/260/2012) was instituted with

the proper documentation annexed. That case culminated in the

issuance of an Order Nisi, which was eventually made absolute on

08.08.2013.

4. Aggrieved by the said Order Absolute, the Respondents

unsuccessfully appealed to the High Court by way of appeal and

then sought revision (HCCA/REV/COL/34/2015), which was

allowed, thereby reversing the learned District Judges decision.

The Petitioner Bank thereafter sought leave to appeal to this Court,

which was granted.

P a g e 6 | 8

5. The question arose in the revision application whether the plea of

res judicata would bar the maintainability of the second District

Court application DSP/260/2012 which was filed for ejectment. The

learned High Court judges of the Civil Appellate Court ruled in

favour of Res Judicata and dismissed the action of the Peoples

Bank. Even this Court has granted leave posing the question of law.

1. Does the dismissal of District Court of Colombo, Case No.

74/2010/DSP for the non-production of the original of the

certificate of sale amount to a technically and/or a decision

not given taking into consideration the merits of the respective

cases of the parties?

6. It is trite law that applications under Section 29P of the Peoples

Bank (as amended by No. 32 of 1986) are execution proceedings

rather than substantive actions, and hence the plea of res judicata

cannot be successfully maintained. The earlier case (DSP/74/2010)

was dismissed solely due to a procedural lapse failure to tender

the original Certificate of Sale. No adjudication on the merits

occurred. Accordingly, the dismissal of the said application cannot

preclude the Petitioner from instituting a valid application upon

rectifying the defect.

7. Section 29N of the said Act makes it abundantly clear that once a

Certificate of Sale is issued, all rights, title, and interest of the

P a g e 7 | 8

borrower vest in the purchaser. The Certificate is conclusive proof

of compliance with statutory requirements. This Court is guided by

precedent in Jayawardena v Sampath Bank1, Hatton

National Bank v Marimuttu2, and Haji Omar v

Wickramasinghe3, which consistently affirm the finality and legal

conclusiveness of Certificates of Sale issued under this legislation.

8. It is also noted that the High Court erroneously relied on the

absence of a reservation of right to file a subsequent action when

dismissing DSP/74/10. No provision in law mandates such a

reservation in execution proceedings. Therefore, such reasoning

lacks legal basis.

9. For the foregoing reasons, this Court is of the considered view that

the principle of res judicata is inapplicable to the subsequent

application filed under Section 29P of the Amendment Act No. 32

of 1986. The Petitioner Bank acquired valid title to the property

upon the issuance of the Certificate of Sale in accordance with law.

10. The Petitioner Bank is legally entitled to seek vacant possession of

the property through execution proceedings. Accordingly, the

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court dated 28th February

2017 is hereby set aside. The judgment of the learned Additional

P a g e 8 | 8

District Judge of Colombo dated 8th August 2013 in Case No.

DSP/260/2012 is affirmed.

11. The appeal of the Petitioner-Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant is

thus allowed with costs.
