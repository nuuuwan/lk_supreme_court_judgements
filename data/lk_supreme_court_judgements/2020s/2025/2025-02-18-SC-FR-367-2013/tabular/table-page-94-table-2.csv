"â€¢ 
A  pass  in  all  subjections  under  the  old  syllabus  would  be"
"sufficient."
"21. Upon careful consideration of the aforementioned criteria, it is evident"
"that clear distinctions exist between the entry requirements applicable"
"to  the  positions  of  Document  Assistants  and  Public  Management"
"Assistants. Accordingly, it is sufficient to conclude that these two job"
"roles are distinct in nature."
"22. As evident in ['RA 1-a'] dated 11.12.2013, the entry qualifications for"
"Document Assistants are listed as Passes in 6 subjects at the G.C.E"
"(O/L)  Examination  with  Credit  passes 
in  4  subjects 
including"
"Sinhala/Tamil/English  and  Mathematics  and  Pass 
in  at 
least  1"
"subject at the G.C.E (A/L) examination (excluding the common general"
"test) whereas for the position of public management assistant in [RA-"
"1-b]  are  specified  as  Passes 
in  6  subjects  at 
the  G.C.E 
(O/L)"
"examination 
in  a  single  sitting  with  Credit  passes 
in  4  subjects"
"including Sinhala/Tamil/ English and Mathematics and Passes in all"
"subjects at the G.C.E (A/L) Examination in a single sitting (under the"
"Old Syllabus, passes in at least 3 subjects in a single sitting. Further"
"comparison  of  Documents  [RA2-a]  and  [RA2-b]  reveals  significant"
"differences  in  the  duties  and  functions  associated  with  the  role  of"
"Document Assistants and Public Management Assistants."
"23. However, in relation to documents marked [RA 1-a] and in [RA 1-b], it"
"is observed and the Court is mindful that these documents are dated"
"subsequent  to  the  filing  of  this  case.  Nevertheless,  the  Court  finds"
"these documents to be relevant solely for the purpose of understanding"
"the distinctions between the two roles in question. The Court does not"
"treat 
the  documents  as  evidence  of 
the  matters 
in  dispute  but"
"considers them only to demonstrate that the two roles are not equal."
