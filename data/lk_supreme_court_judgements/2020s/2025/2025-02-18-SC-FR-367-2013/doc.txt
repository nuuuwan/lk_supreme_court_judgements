Respondents

88

Before : S. Thurairaja, PC, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J K. Priyantha Fernando, J Counsel : Manohara de Silva, PC with Dilmini de Silva, Senal Kariyawasam and Harithriya Kumarage instructed by Anusha Perusinghe for the Petitioner.

Hashini Opatha, SSC instructed by Rizni Firdous for all Respondents. Argued on : 19.11.2024 Decided on : 18.02.2025 K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J 1. The 1st to 278th petitioners have filed the instant application alleging

that, the fundamental rights guaranteed to them in terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated by the respondents in their refusal to categorize the petitioners as Management Assistants Non Technical Segment 1 and place them in salary scale MN-2-2006-A under P.A Circular NO.6/2006 and subsequent revisions made to the said Circular. 2. This Court on 30.05.2019, having heard the submissions of the

learned Counsel for the Petitioners and the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Respondents, decided to grant Leave to Proceed in respect of the alleged violation of the Fundamental rights guaranteed to the Petitioners under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

3. The petitioners in their petition dated 23.10.2013, state that the 1st

to 278th Petitioners are Document Assistants attached to the Ministry of Education. The 279th Petitioner is the Education Documents Assistants Union.

4. The petitioners state that, by Cabinet Memorandum bearing

No.79/00 dated 11.08.2000 approval of the Cabinet ministers were

89

sought to change the designation of the post of Clerks of the Department of Education to Document Assistants and the post of Typists to Computer Data entry operators. The changes were due to the difficulty in assigning clerks to schools other than urban popular schools, and the fact that Clerks attached to the aforesaid institutions perform different duties than those in the general clerical service which includes working outside of normal working hours in assisting extra-curricular activities of the said institutions. The petitioners further state that, the aforesaid memorandum mentioned that the Salary scale applicable to the Clerical and Allied services would be applicable for the said posts and this was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 17.08.2000. The petitioners state that, thereafter they were appointed to the post of Document Assistants Grade II B of the Ministry of Education and were placed in the salary T-2-1 in terms of P.A circular 2/97 (111). 5. The petitioners contend that, upon the creation of the Public

Management Assistants Service in 2004, clerks were absorbed into the said service and were placed in salary scale T 2 2 of circular No.15/2003. However, the petitioners contend that, no corresponding salary revisions were made for the post of Document Assistants even though in the aforesaid Cabinet Memorandum it has been stated that the salary applicable to clerks should be applicable to Document Assistants as well.

6. According to the petitioners, in document marked P-9A and P-9B, in

2006 the government implemented a new salary structure for the public service which involved the public management assistants and in the implementation of the same, P.A. Circular No.6/2006 was issued on 25.04.2006, containing the provisions relating to restructuring of the salaries of the public service.

7. The petitioners state that, P.A circular No.6/ 2006 sougt to rectify the

salary anomaly which was created in 2004, by providing in paragraph 3.2.1.1 of Annexture II, that Departmental posts such as clerks shall be absorbed as Management Assistants Non-Technical Segment 1 category after the formulation of a new scheme concerning their services to a multi duty service similar to the Public Management Assistantss service within 3 months. It further required the relavant ministries to formulate new schemes of recruitment and submit the same for the approval of the Director General of Establishments with the recommendation of National Salaries and Cadre Commission,

90

whereupon the salary applicable to the Public Management Assistant service would be applicable to the new service with effect from 01.01.2006.

8. It is the position of the petitioners that, since the post of Document

Assistant was not included in Annexture III (Index to salary conversion) of Circular No.6/2006, the Ministry of Education was required to formulate a new scheme of recruitment in respect of Document Assistants and submit the schemes of recruitment to the National Salaries and Cadre Commission for its recommendation in order to place them in the salary scale applicable to the public Management Assistants Service. However, the Ministry of Education has failed to do so. The petitioners contend that, they had a legitimate expectation that the Ministry of Education would formulate a new scheme of recruitment in line with the scheme of recruitment of the Public Management Assistants Service and would make the Necessary Arrangements to place them in Salary Scale MN-2-2006-A. 9. The petitioners submit that, the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers which includes 26th to 93rd Respondents on the particular Cabinet Memorandum which was titled as Absorption of Documents Assistants of the Ministry of Education to Public Management Assistants service is arbitrary, Capricious, unreasonable and violative of the fundaments rights guaranteed to them under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

10. Based on the above allegations, the petitioners have submitted that

their fundamental rights have been violated and contends that they are entitled to be categorized as Management Assistants Non-Technical Segment 1 and be placed in salary scale MN - 2 - 2006 - A.

11. The learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st 93rd Respondents,

making her submissions stated that, the role of the aforesaid Public Management Assistants Service was in fact a distinct and a separate service which was an amalgamation of the Government Clerical Service, the Government Typists Service, the Government Stenographers Service, the Government Book Keepers Service, The Government Shroffs Service and the Government Store-Keepers Service which previously belonged to the Combined Service.

91

12. The learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondents contended

that, the reason behind the Document Assistants who held a Departmental Post to not be absorbed into the Public Management Assistants Service was the fact that there was a clear distinction between the nature and function of their roles and responsibilities and their entry level qualifications when compared with those who were absorbed into the said service.

13. According to the Senior State Counsel for the Respondents, the post

of Document Assistants, was only a re-designation of the Departmental Post of clerk, which was done pursuant to the Cabinet decision in document marked P-2 and that they were never absorbed as Public Management assistants and due to this the Counsel takes the position that, the Document Assistants were not entitled to be categorized as Management assistants Non Technical Segment 1, unless and until a new scheme of Recruitment was formulated covering their service into a multi duty service similar to the Public Management Assistants Service.

14. The learned Deputy Solicitor General in her written submissions filed

on behalf of the respondents state that, the decision to categorize Document Assistants as Management AssistantNon-Technical Segment 2 was based entirely on the entry qualifications, the skills required and the duties and functions they perform, as set out in the Public Administration Circular No.06/2006 and that the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers not to approve the proposal to appoint the Document Assistants as Management Assistant Non Technical Segment 1, based on the nature and functions and the applicable criteria in terms of Circular No.06 /2006 was lawful. 15. In light of that, the main issue at hand is to consider whether, by

refusing to categorize the petitioners (Documents Assistants and typists) as Management Assistants Non-Technical Segment 1 and by refusing to place them in salary scale MN-2-2006-A, the 1st-93rd respondents have violated the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioners under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Alleged violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

16. Article 12(1) of the Constitution provides that, All persons are equal

before the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law.

92

17. In case of Tuan Ishan Raban and others V Members of the Police

Commission and Pradeep Priyadarshana V Members of the Police Commission and others, (2007) 2 SLR page 359, Bandaranayake J. stated that,

Equality as postulated in Article 12(1) of the Constitution means the right of a person to be treated alike among his equals and such rights to be administered equally. Equality thus means that there should not be any discrimination among those who are equally circumstanced. Thus Article 12(1) of the Constitution ensures the protection from arbitrary and discriminatory action by the executive and/or the administration. The objective of Article 12(1) of the Constitution therefore is to give persons equal treatment. However, such guaranty does not forbid reasonable classification, which is founded on intelligible differentia. The concept of equality only forbids action which is unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and not the classification that is reasonable... 18. Hence, in the instant case, the question to consider is whether by not

grouping the petitioners as Management Assistants Non-Technical Segment 1, the rights of the petitioners (Document Assistants and the typists) were in fact violated or whether such classification was reasonable. 19. In order to be eligible to fall into the category of Management

Assistants Non-Technical Segment 1 under the salary scale MN-2-2006, one must have ideally been in the Public Management Assistants category. Document [P-9A] reflects that, in order to implement the new salary structure, all posts and services within the public service were required to be re-categorized by each respective ministry and department. In accordance with this directive, the Public Management Assistants were classified into Segment 1 under the salary scale MN-2-2006, based on specific entry criteria, including the required GCE O-level and A-level qualifications at the time of recruitment, as well as defined skills of a specified nature.

20. In light of that, one must draw their attention to documents marked

[P4A], and [P33] which contains the entry requirements in terms of age, educational qualifications and functions of the role of Document Assistants and for Public Management Assistants respectively. As per document marked [P4A] dated 2000.11.08, the requirements for the post of Document Assistants are as follows;

Age: 18 - 45 years

Educational qualifications: Pass GCE O/L exams with simple

passes in six subjects including one of language (Sinhala/ Tamil) and pure math, basic math, and combined math in no more than two sittings. Candidate must have passed five subjects in one sitting, of which, the candidate should have credit passes for three subjects including Sinhala or,

Candidate must pass six subjects including first language/ Tamil and

Math in no more than two sittings in GCE O/L exams Candidate must have passed five subjects in one sitting, of which, the candidate should have credit passes for three subjects including Sinhala or,

Candidate must pass GCE O/L exams with at least simple passes in

6 subjects including language (Sinhala/ Tamil) and math in no more than two sittings. Candidate must have passed five subjects in one sitting, of which, the candidate should have credit passes for three subjects including language.

Further, document marked [P-33] dated 2004.12.24 lays down the criterion to be eligible for the role of Public Management Assistants service as follows;

Age: 18 - 30 years

Educational qualifications: Should have passed the

General Certificate of Education (Ordinary Level) Examination in six (06) subjects at one sitting with credit passes in

i. Sinhala / Tamil / English Language; ii. Mathematics and

94

iii. Two other subjects and 6 passes in GCE Ordinary Level Examinations with 4 A passes for four subjects including for Sinhala / Tamil / English and Mathematics and, A pass in all subjects at the General Certificate of Education

(Advanced Level) Examination (other than the common general paper) at one sitting. A pass in all subjections under the old syllabus would be

sufficient. 21. Upon careful consideration of the aforementioned criteria, it is evident

that clear distinctions exist between the entry requirements applicable to the positions of Document Assistants and Public Management Assistants. Accordingly, it is sufficient to conclude that these two job roles are distinct in nature. 22. As evident in ['RA 1-a'] dated 11.12.2013, the entry qualifications for

Document Assistants are listed as Passes in 6 subjects at the G.C.E (O/L) Examination with Credit passes in 4 subjects including Sinhala/Tamil/English and Mathematics and Pass in at least 1 subject at the G.C.E (A/L) examination (excluding the common general test) whereas for the position of public management assistant in [RA-1-b] are specified as Passes in 6 subjects at the G.C.E (O/L) examination in a single sitting with Credit passes in 4 subjects including Sinhala/Tamil/ English and Mathematics and Passes in all subjects at the G.C.E (A/L) Examination in a single sitting (under the Old Syllabus, passes in at least 3 subjects in a single sitting. Further comparison of Documents [RA2-a] and [RA2-b] reveals significant differences in the duties and functions associated with the role of Document Assistants and Public Management Assistants.

23. However, in relation to documents marked [RA 1-a] and in [RA 1-b], it

is observed and the Court is mindful that these documents are dated subsequent to the filing of this case. Nevertheless, the Court finds these documents to be relevant solely for the purpose of understanding the distinctions between the two roles in question. The Court does not treat the documents as evidence of the matters in dispute but considers them only to demonstrate that the two roles are not equal.

24. In light of the evidence presented, it is clear that the roles of Document

Assistants and Public Management Assistants are distinct. Therefore, as reflected in document [P28] the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers not to approve the proposal to appoint Document Assistants as Management Assistants Non-Technical - Segment 1 in view of their nature and functions and the application criteria laid down in terms of public Admin circular 06/2006 can be considered justified and correct. While the learned counsel for the petitioners contend that they belong to Management Assistants Non-Technical -Segment 1, based on the above evidence it is clear that they do not fall within the category of Public Management Assistants as defined for this segment. Accordingly, the petitioners' argument in this regard cannot be sustained. 25. In the case of Palihawadana v Attorney General and two others,

[1979] 1 SLR page 65 it is discussed as to how Article 12 prescribes equality before the law and equal protection of the law, but how equality in any literal or abstract sense is not attainable. For the purpose of applying a particular law or operating an administrative scheme reasonable classification is permissible and a certain measure of inequality is permitted.

What is prohibited is class legislation; but reasonable classification is not forbidden. The principle underlying the guarantee in Article 12 is not that the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, or that the same remedies should be made available to them irrespective of differences of circumstances. It only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in respect of privileges conferred and liabilities imposed... 26. Thus, the classification must not be arbitrary but rather should be

based on some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object sought. It must appear that not only a classification has been made, but also that it is based upon some reasonable ground, i.e. some difference which bears a just and proper relation to the attempted classification.

27. Based on the above considerations and the precedence set out, it can

be said that, while Article 12 of the Constitution guarantees equality for all, it does not preclude reasonable classification based on intelligible differentia. In the present case, based on the reasons

96

discussed above, including the distinctions between the roles, their respective entry requirements, duties, and functions, it is apparent that these differences justify the classification. Therefore, it can be reasonably concluded that the classification is rational and founded on these distinctions. Accordingly, the classification of the respondents cannot be deemed arbitrary. 28. Therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to obtain relief from this

Court as there is no violation of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to them by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Application is dismissed.
