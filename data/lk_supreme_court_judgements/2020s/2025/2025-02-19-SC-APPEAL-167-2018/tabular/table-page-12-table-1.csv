"Thus, the pecuniary loss that could have been calculated for each Plaintiff-Respondent has to be"
"as follows;"
"For the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent Rs. 1500 per month X 12 X 12 = Rs. 216,000/-"
"For the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent Rs.1500 per month X 12 X 9   = Rs. 162,000/-"
"For the 3rd Plaintiff-Respondent Rs 1500 per month X 12 X 37 = Rs. 666,000/-"
"The above pecuniary loss to the Plaintiffs-Respondents totals up to Rs. 1,044,000/-. However, the"
"amount given as damages through the judgments of courts below amounts to Rs.3,500,000/-."
"The above clearly establish that the courts below failed to consider relevant facts in calculating the"
"damages and thus erred in their decision in that regard. Thus, the question of law allowed by this"
"Court is answered in the affirmative."
"For the forgoing reason, this appeal is partly allowed, and it is directed that the Judgment of the"
"Civil Appellate High Court dated 21.11.2016 and the Judgment of the District Court of Balapitiya"
"dated 15.12.2014 should stand amended in accordance with the above decision of this Court."
"Appeal is partly allowed. No costs."
