"had also considered that the 3rd Defendant-Appellant was directly negligent, may be due to"
"the fact that he employed a person without license as his conductor."
"However, it is observed when assessing the compensation to be paid, the Learned District Judge"
"had  just  stated  that,  since  the  deceased  was  23  years  old  at  the  time  of  his  death,  1st  and  2nd"
"Plaintiffs-Respondents did not have any employment and there was evidence of a disabled child"
"born to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs-Respondents, it is his decision that all of them had been looked"
"after by the income earned by the deceased. Hence, the Learned District Judge had decided that"
"the  Plaintiffs-Respondents  are  entitled  to  claim  the  amounts  as  prayed  in  the  Plaint  from  the"
"Defendants, jointly and severally."
"It appears that the Learned District Judge had failed to consider that the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent"
"was a conductor of CTB at the time of the accident and the fact that a considerable amount from"
"the income of the deceased should have been spent on his own expenses, such as meals, travelling,"
"clothing and medical expenses by the deceased. Further, being an unmarried person of 23 years of"
"age,  naturally  he  could  have  saved  some  money  for  his  future.  On  behalf  of  the  Plaintiffs-"
"Respondents, it is argued that the deceased being a security officer could have gained promotions"
"if he lived. However, if he lived without facing the accident, being a person of 23 years of age, he"
"could have got married and made a family of his own and might not have been able to maintain"
"the parents and said mentally retarded brother in the same manner as stated in evidence of the 1st"
"Plaintiff-Respondent.  As  per  the  evidence  given  by  the  1st  Plaintiff-Respondent  in  the  District"
"Court, he retired from service as a conductor only in 2009, which is two years after the accident"
"and had been given Rs.500,000/-, from the Employment Provident Fund, which indicates that the"
"deceased could not have been the sole breadwinner of the family. As stated above, the Learned"
"District Judge had not considered these factors in deciding the pecuniary loss caused by the death"
"of the deceased and accordingly in calculation of the compensation given as a relief."
"It is also observed that even though the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent had not given evidence relating"
"to the pecuniary loss caused to her due to the death of her son and no documentary evidence was"
"placed before the Learned District Judge to prove that the 3rd Plaintiff-Respondent was a brother"
