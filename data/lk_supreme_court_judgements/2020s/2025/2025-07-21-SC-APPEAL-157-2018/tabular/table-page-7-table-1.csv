"In the instant case, the summons has been served but the 1st respondent had"
"failed to take note of what has been stated in the summons, which clearly shows"
"the negligent attitude of the 1st respondent, who had been a practicing attorney"
"for over a decade."
"Therefore, it is my opinion that the explanation of the 1st respondent is an abuse"
"of process, which should not be tolerated and encouraged and as such, I am of"
"the  opinion  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  had  applied  the  meaning  of"
"section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code too liberally, which would only lead to"
"abuse of process."
"As such, the instant appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court is hereby"
"set aside and the order of the learned District Judge is hereby affirmed and  I"
"answer the question of law raised in the affirmative."
