P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

The Rule dated 14-06-2023 under the hand of the Registrar of this Court has been issued against the

Respondent Attorney-at-Law. When the court read out the Rule on 14-06-2023, the Respondent

Attorney-at-Law had pleaded not guilty to the charges contained in the Rule. Therefore, the Court had

fixed the matter for inquiry.

The Rule dated 14-06-2023 is as follows :

WHEREAS a Complaint has been made to His Lordship the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court

of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, by Saman Masakorala (hereinafter referred to as

the Complainant) by letter dated 03-08-2020.

AND WHEREAS in terms of the Complaint of the said Complainant,

a) On 18-12-2018, the Complainant, in order to purchase Lot 7B depicted in Plan No.

7308 prepared by Surveyor Gamini Malwenna entrusted you with the sum of five

hundred thousand Rupees (Rs. 500,000) and further entrusted you with the sum

of thirty thousand Rupees (Rs. 30,000) in order to execute and register the Deed

pertaining to the said Lot 7B; and

b) that despite having received instruction from the Complainant to execute and

register a Deed of Transfer in his name pertaining to the said Lot 7B you did not

register the Deed bearing No. 128 pertaining to the transfer of the aforesaid lot 7B

and thereby you acted in contravention of Section 26 (b) of the Notaries Ordinance;

and

c) that without a legal basis and proper authority, you provided a right of way over

the above mentioned Lot 7B in respect of which you had instructions to register a

Deed of transfer in the name of the Complainant, in the Deed bearing No. 126

dated 26.06.2019 that was executed by you in respect of Lot 7A depicted in the

same plan, to Chaminda Pushpa Kumara.

AND WHEREAS it appears that, the said Deed bearing No. 126 had been executed by

you even though one of the transferors namely, Lalitha Werapitiya was deceased at

the time of the execution of the said Deed.

AND WHEREAS it appears that,

a) By reason of the aforesaid acts and conduct, you have not exercised your skill with

due diligence to the best of your ability and care in the interest of your client and

have thus committed the breach of Rule 15 of the Supreme Court (Conduct of and

Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law) Rules 1988, made under Article 136 of the

Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka; and

b) by reason of the aforesaid acts and conduct, you have conducted yourself in a

manner which would be reasonably regarded as disgraceful or dishonorable by

Attorneys-at-Law of good repute and competency and have thus committed breach

of Rule 60 of the Supreme Court (Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law)

Rules 1988, made under Article 136 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka; and

c) by reason of aforesaid act and conduct you have conducted yourself in a manner

which would render yourself unfit to remain an Attorney-at-Law and have thus

committed breach of Rule 60 of the said Rules; and

d) by reason of the aforesaid acts and conduct, you have conducted yourself in a

manner which is inexcusable and such as to regarded as deplorable by your fellows

in the profession and have thus committed the breach of Rule 60 of the said rules;

e) by reason of the aforesaid acts and conduct, you have conducted yourself in a

manner unworthy of an Attorney-at-Law, and have thus committed the breach of

SC RULE 05/2023 Page 4 of 5

Rule 60 of the said Rules; and

f) By reason of aforesaid acts, you have committed acts of

I. Deceit and/or

II. Malpractice

AND WHEREAS this Court has decided that proceedings for suspension from practice or

removal from the office of Attorney-at-Law should be taken against you under Section 42(2)

of the Judicature Act No.02 of 1978 read with the Supreme Court Rules (Part VII) of 1978.

This is therefore to command you in terms of Section 42(3) of the Judicature Act No 02 of

the 1978, to show cause why should not be suspended from practice or be removed from

the office of Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court of Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka, in terms of Section 42(2) of the aforesaid Act.

While the acts alleged against the Respondent Attorney-at-Law are self explanatory from the several

paragraphs contained in the Rule as mentioned above, I observe that the Rule issued against the

Respondent Attorney-at-Law has alleged breaches of Rule 15 and Rule 60 of the Supreme Court

(Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law) Rules 1988. As per the Rule, there are several acts

which the Respondent Attorney-at-Law has allegedly committed in this instance. According to the

Rule, it is those acts committed by the Respondent Attorney-at-Law which have rendered the

Respondent Attorney-at-Law unfit to remain as an Attorney-at-Law of the Supreme Court in terms of

the Supreme Court (Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorneys at Law) Rules 1988.

During the course of the inquiry, the Respondent Attorney-at-Law admitted the following:

1. The fact that she has prepared Deed No. 128 and obtained the signatures which appeared

on the said deed.

2. The fact that she has executed Deed No. 126 dated 26-06-2019.

3. The fact that Deed No. 128 has not been registered in the Land Registry.

4. The fact that she has submitted Deed No. 128 to the Land Registry of Panadura for its

registration.

5. The fact that Lalitha Werapitiya stood as one of the transferors in Deed No. 126.

SC RULE 05/2023 Page 5 of 5

6. The fact that Lalitha Werapitiya was deceased at the time of the execution of Deed No.

126 dated 26-06-2019.

7. The fact that she received no instructions from the Complainant to convey the relevant

right of way as per Deed No. 126 to another party namely Chaminda Pushpa Kumara.

When the Court was proceeding with the inquiry, half way through, the learned Presidents

Counsel appearing for the Respondent Attorney-at-Law informed Court that the Respondent

Attorney-at-Law would withdraw her earlier plea of not guilty entered on 14-06-2023 and would

enter a plea of guilty to the charges contained in the Rule dated 14-06-2023. Accordingly, Court

proceeded to verify this personally from the Respondent Attorney-at-Law who stated before Court

that she is pleading guilty to the charges in the Rule.

Having considered all those circumstances under which the Respondent Attorney-at-Law has been

found guilty of an act of deceit which is also a malpractice, acting in terms of section 42 of the

Judicature Act, I direct that the Respondent Attorney-at-Law Samitha Samanmalee Thennakoon

be suspended from engaging in practice as an Attorney-at-Law for 04 years with effect from the

date of this Order.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to forthwith take all necessary steps to implement this

Order suspending the Respondent Attorney-at-Law from her practice.
