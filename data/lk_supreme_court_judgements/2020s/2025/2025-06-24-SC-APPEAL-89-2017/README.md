K.KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J

The Application for Special Leave to Appeal was preferred by Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) against the judgement of the High Court of the Central

Province dated 29.04.2016 dismissing the Appeal of the Appellant. Aggrieved by which the

Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.

2

Accordingly this Court by Order dated 05/05/2017 granted special leave to Appeal on the

following questions of Law:

a)Did the Honourable High Court of the Central Province arrive at an erroneous Conclusion that

the said Deed of Transfer 2357(P14) constitutes an outright transfer?

b)Did the Honourable High Court of the Central Province err in Law by arriving at a wrongful

conclusion that only secondary evidence could be led in terms of Section 91 and Section 92 of

the Evidence Ordinance since the said deed was the Deed of Transfer and fail to identify the

proper cause of action which was based on the Constructive Trust?

c)Did the High Court of Central Province err in Law in failing to consider that parol evidence

cannot be led to establish constructive trust?

d)Did the High Court of the Central Province arrive at an erroneous conclusion that the

Petitioner cannot proceed with the case in view of the third admission between the parties?

g)Did the Courts below err in drawing correct inferences from the attendant circumstances which

clearly point that there was no intention to dispose of the beneficial interest by the Petitioner?

BRIEF FACTS OF THE CASE ARE AS FOLLOWS:

The property in question, which is the subject of this appeal, originally belonged to the

Appellant's husband. Upon his passing, ownership transferred to the Appellant. Since 1980, the

Appellant had used the property as collateral to secure loans on multiple occasions.

In 1997, due to her husband’s illness, the Appellant borrowed money from one W.A.

Hathurusinghe. At his request, she transferred part of the property to him by Deed No. 8679. The

remaining portion was transferred to one Cyril Gamage by Deed No. 2339 to raise additional

funds for her husband’s medical expenses.

Subsequently, the Appellant borrowed Rs. 60,000/= from the father of the 1st Defendant-

Respondent- Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent). He agreed to lend the

money on the condition that a monthly interest of Rs. 3,000/= would be paid. As the process of

transferring the property back from Hathurusinghe and Gamage would involve additional costs,

the 1st Respondent’s father insisted that the property be transferred directly into the name of his

3

son—the 1st Respondent. Accordingly, on 05/01/1998, the property was transferred to the 1st

Respondent via Deed No. 2357.

The Appellant, in her petition, stated that she never intended to transfer the beneficial ownership

of the property to the 1st Respondent. However, when she requested a reasonable time to repay

the loan, the Respondent claimed full ownership of the property and attempted to evict her.

The Appellant contends that the Respondents are holding the property in constructive trust on her

behalf. As a result, she filed an action in the District Court of Gampola on 22/02/2002, seeking

the following reliefs:

1.​ A declaration that she is the rightful owner of the property.

2.​ An order that the Respondents hold the property in trust for her.

3.​ A directive for the Respondents to reconvey the property to her upon repayment of the

Rs. 60,000/=.

4.​ In the event of non-compliance, an order directing the Court Registrar to transfer the

property back to her.

5.​ An interim injunction restraining the Respondents from entering the land or causing any

damage.

The 1st Respondent filed his answer on 12/02/2002, claiming that he became the lawful owner

through Deed No. 2357 dated 05/01/1998. He further stated that he subsequently transferred the

property to the 2nd Respondent via Deed No. 10719 dated 19/03/2002. Therefore, he argued that

the Appellant has no valid cause of action.

After the matter was set for trial on 04.10.2004, three admissions were recorded between the

parties. The Appellant raised issues numbered 1 to 35, while the 1st Respondent raised issues

numbered 36 to 40.

According to the District Court judgment, three key points of admission were accepted:

1.​ Jurisdiction was not contested.

2.​ The location of the property and the subject matter of the case were accepted.

4

3.​ As stated in paragraph 18 of the plaint, the 1st Defendant admitted that the property in

question was acquired on a freehold basis.

The judgment of the District Court of Gampola, dated 02.12.2013, was primarily based on the

third admission. In addition, the decision relied on the answers given for Issue No. 27 and Issue

No. 36, which were as follows:

Issue 27:​

As stated in paragraph 19 of the plaint, did the Plaintiff, along with W.A. Hathurusinghe and Siril

Gamage, transfer the said property to the 1st Defendant by Deed No. 2357 dated 05.01.1998?

Issue 36:

Was the property referred to in the plaint transferred to the 1st Defendant in freehold by Deed

No. 2357 dated 05.01.1998, executed by the Plaintiff and W.A. Hathurusinghe, and attested by

the Notary Public T.B. Abeyakoon?

Based on the third admission and the answers to the above issues, the District Court delivered its

judgment in favor of the 1st Respondent. Aggrieved by this decision, the Appellant filed an

appeal before the High Court of the Central Province on 31.01.2014. By its order dated

29.04.2016, the High Court of the Central Province dismissed the appeal on the following

grounds:

In accordance with the third admission made in the District Court, the Appellant acknowledged

that the 1st Respondent had acquired the disputed property through a deed of transfer (Deed No.

2357), executed by three parties including the Appellant. Therefore, under Section 2 of the

Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, once the land was transferred in accordance with proper legal

procedure, the Appellant no longer held any legal interest in the property. The burden of proof

was on the Appellant to establish that the 1st Respondent held the property in trust for the

Appellant.

The High Court emphasised the importance of Deed No. 2357 (marked as P14), which clearly

stated that the property had been transferred and assigned to the 1st Respondent. According to

Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance, once such a deed exists, only secondary

5

evidence is permitted where applicable. The law does not allow the introduction of other

evidence to contradict, vary, or modify the terms of a written agreement.

The Court also noted that although three parties who originally held legal interest in the disputed

property had transferred their rights to the 1st Respondent, the present case was filed solely by

the Appellant. This was viewed as a potential misuse of the law, as it appeared that the property

had been deliberately transferred only in the name of the Appellant for the purposes of

litigation.Based on these considerations, the High Court upheld the judgment of the District

Court of Gampola.

Aggrieved by the abovementioned Judgement the Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court and

accordingly this court granted special leave to appeal from the aforementioned judgement.

I now proceed to address the first question of law, namely:

“Did the Honourable High Court of the Central Province arrive at an erroneous conclusion

that Deed of Transfer No. 2357 (P14) constitutes an outright transfer?”

I refer to The Law of Property in Sri Lanka by Professor G.L. Peiris, which explains that

tradition of delivery alone does not amount to a transfer of ownership unless five essential

conditions are satisfied:

1.​ The transfer must be made with the intention of transferring ownership ex iusta

causa—i.e., the nature of the disposition must be such that, in law, the transfer of

possession also signifies a transfer of ownership.

2.​ The transferor must be legally competent to alienate the property.

3.​ The property must be legally capable of being alienated through delivery.

4.​ The transferee must be competent and willing to accept ownership as a consequence of

the transfer.

5.​ The transferor must either be the owner or act under the authority of the owner, such as a

servant or agent.

6

In answering the first question of law, the facts of the case must be examined against the

backdrop of these five conditions to determine whether Deed No. 2357 amounts to an outright

transfer.

Condition 1: Intention to Transfer Ownership

The District Judge of Gampola held that the Appellant, by admitting the third point of admission

(that the property was transferred by Deed No. 2357 executed by the parties with beneficial

interest), could not thereafter challenge the deed under Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance, which bar the admission of oral evidence to vary the terms of a notarially executed

deed.

However, on appeal, the Appellant argued that the learned District Judge misinterpreted the third

admission. Paragraph 18 of the Plaint explained that the purpose of executing the deed was to

obtain a loan, with the promise of paying monthly interest of Rs. 3,000, as the Appellant required

funds to treat her ailing husband.

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance states:

“Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot reasonably be

inferred consistently with the attendant circumstances that he intended to dispose of

the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must hold such property for

the benefit of the owner or his legal representative.”

This principle was further elaborated in Muttammah v. Thiyagaraja [1960] 62 NLR 559, where

Chief Justice Basnayake observed that:

“The section is designed to prevent transfers of property which on the face of the

instrument appear to be genuine transfers, but where an intention to dispose of the

beneficial interest cannot reasonably be inferred consistently with the attendant

circumstances.”

The key question is whether the District Judge gave due consideration to the attendant

circumstances referenced in Paragraph 18 of the Plaint.

7

According to Muttammah v. Thiyagaraja, “attendant circumstances” refer to events that precede

or follow the transfer and are closely connected in time. They must be viewed in the context of

the specific facts of each case.

The attendant circumstances that must be established are as follows: a series of transactions

where the beneficial interest was not transferred, involving the transfer of property and its

subsequent retransfer following the settlement of a loan. In this case, several such circumstances

demonstrate that the transfer was not intended to be absolute:

It is on record that several individuals who had previously provided loans testified in favor of the

Appellant. It was proven that the Appellant’s husband was unwell and that she was in urgent

need of money, a fact further substantiated by his subsequent death. Medical prescriptions

confirming his illness (marked P31 to P36), along with a copy of his death certificate (P37), were

submitted as part of the evidence, reinforcing the credibility of this claim.

Two deeds of transfer, bearing Nos. 8679 (P12) and 2239 (P13), executed in favor of

Hathurusinghe and Cyril Gamage, respectively, concern the same property and were executed as

security for loans obtained by the Appellant. These individuals also testified to support the

Appellant’s version of events.

When the Appellant required additional funds, she approached the Chief Priest, Ven. Atabage

Sumanathissa, who introduced her to the father of the 1st Respondent for the purpose of

obtaining a further loan. The said Chief Priest gave evidence at trial in favor of the Appellant,

and his testimony remained unchallenged during cross-examination.

However, when the burden of proof shifted to the Appellant to establish the existence of a

constructive trust, the Appellant was unable to produce a written agreement documenting the

arrangement with the father of the 1st Respondent. The only document available to support this

claim is a letter written by the 1st Respondent’s father, which refers to the repayment of the loan.

This letter has been certified by the 1st Respondent as being in his father's handwriting.

8

While such a letter cannot override the terms of a notarial deed, it can serve as an attendant

circumstance supporting the existence of a constructive trust under Section 83 of the Trusts

Ordinance.

This legal position has been affirmed in several judgments:

Carthelis v. Perera [1930] 32 NLR 19: Held that a non-notarial writing can establish an

equitable interest.

Ehiya Lebbe v. Majeed [1947] 48 NLR 357: A non-notarial document executed on the

same day as the deed was accepted as evidence of a constructive trust.

Premawathi v. Gnanawathi [1994] 2 SLR 171 and Thisa Nona and Others v.

Premadasa [1997] 1 SLR 169: Both reaffirm the evidentiary value of non-notarial

documents in establishing attendant circumstances and constructive trusts.

In conclusion, the High Court’s finding that Deed No. 2357 constituted an outright transfer

appears to overlook the surrounding circumstances and applicable trust principles under Section

83. The evidence presented, including the purpose of the transfer, the conduct of the parties, and

corroborative testimony, strongly suggests the existence of a constructive trust. Therefore, the

conclusion of the Honourable High Court on this issue warrants re-examination.

Condition 2-The Transferor must be legally competent to alienate

The 1st Respondent, in his Answer, contends that the Appellant had no legal right, title, or

interest in the property—neither prior to, at the time of, nor after the execution of the transaction.

This argument seeks to challenge the Appellant’s beneficial interest in the property. However, it

is evident that the Appellant had previously obtained loans from Hathurusinghe and Gamage by

executing Deeds of Transfer bearing Nos. 8679 and 2239 (marked P12 and P13), offering the

same property as security. This conduct indicates that the Appellant exercised control and

asserted beneficial ownership over the property, which undermines the Respondent’s claim.

According to Exception 1 to Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance, when a public officer is

required by law to be appointed in writing, and it is shown that a particular person has acted in

that capacity, the written instrument of appointment need not be produced in evidence.

9

In this context, during cross-examination, oral testimony was supported by a set of relevant

documents that further established the Appellant's intention and authority concerning the

property. These include:

1.​ Annual Tax Receipts paid in respect of the said property (P22 to P28);

2.​ An Affidavit certified by a Justice of the Peace, who also served as the Deputy

Chairman of the relevant Provincial Council (P29).

3.​ A Letter issued by an official of the Agrarian Department, confirming the

Appellant’s continuing relationship with the property and intention not to transfer

ownership (P30).

These documents, though non-notarial, are strong indicators of the Appellant’s continued

beneficial interest and intention. Additionally, the presence of the Appellant’s signature in Deed

No. 2357 (P14) must be viewed in light of these circumstances—it alone cannot be conclusive of

an absolute transfer, especially when weighed against the totality of evidence suggesting the

contrary.

Condition 3 – Whether the Deed Proves a Transfer

This condition is satisfied on the face of the deed itself. The previous set of Deeds of Transfer

related to the property used as security for the loan (marked P1 to P13), along with Deed No.

2357 (P14) and Deed No. 10719 (P39), serve as written evidence to establish that this

immovable property is alienable by delivery, in accordance with the Evidence Ordinance No. 14

of 1895.

Condition 4 – Whether the Transferee Was the Real Beneficiary

Section 84 of the Trusts Ordinance states:​

“Where property is transferred to one person for a consideration paid or provided by another

person, and it appears that such other person did not intend to pay or provide such consideration

for the benefit of the transferee, the transferee must hold the property for the benefit of the person

paying or providing the consideration.”

10

During cross-examination, the transferee claimed that he purchased the property himself for

agricultural purposes. However, this assertion is contradicted by oral testimony and other forms

of evidence.

Two of the transferors who held beneficial interest in the property, along with the Chief Priest (a

witness to Deed No. 2357), testified in favour of the Appellant. The Chief Priest’s

testimony—which was not challenged in cross-examination—affirmed that the father of the 1st

Respondent (Thegiris Appuhamy) had in fact advanced a loan to the Appellant, with an

understanding that he would receive monthly interest until the loan was repaid.

Supporting this version of events is a non-notarial letter written by Thegiris Appuhamy,

requesting repayment of the loan and warning that, failing such repayment, he would proceed to

cultivate tea on the land. This letter was accepted by the 1st Respondent as being in his father's

handwriting, and confirms his awareness of the true purpose behind the transfer. Moreover,

Thegiris Appuhamy signed both as a witness to Deed No. 2357 and the subsequent deed that

transferred the interest to the 2nd Respondent.

His dual involvement, coupled with his knowledge of the transaction’s real intent, establishes his

role as an agent of the 1st Respondent. In terms of Section 84 of the Trusts Ordinance, the

knowledge of the agent (Thegiris Appuhamy) is imputed to the principal (1st Respondent).

Therefore, the transferee cannot claim to be an innocent purchaser without notice of the trust.

Condition 5 – Ownership or Authority of the Transferor

Although the legal title to the property may have initially rested with Hathurusinghe and

Gamage, both parties confirmed through oral evidence that their interest in the property was held

for the benefit of the Appellant. Their willingness to transfer this interest in favour of facilitating

the Appellant’s needs reinforces her continued beneficial ownership.

Furthermore, documents obtained and events that occurred after the execution of the deed further

demonstrate the Appellant’s enduring connection to and control over the property. These include

tax records and official correspondence, all pointing toward her beneficial interest.

11

The High Court, in its reasoning, limited itself to a review of the documentation and relied solely

on the third condition. It failed to consider the substantial body of oral evidence and supporting

non notarial documentation which clearly illustrated the existence of a constructive trust.

Even in the absence of a formal agreement, the letter from Thegiris Appuhamy—acknowledged

by the 1st Respondent as his father’s handwriting—demonstrates the real intention behind the

transaction. It provides compelling evidence that the deed masked a constructive trust, and the

transfer was not absolute.

I will now proceed to answer the second question of Law on which leave has been granted

namely Whether the High Court of the Central Province erred in law by concluding that

only secondary evidence could be led under Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance.

To address this question, it is essential to analyse the wording of Section 91 of the Evidence

Ordinance:

“When the terms of a contract, or of a grant, or any other disposition of property

have been reduced by or by consent of the parties to the form of a document, and in

all cases in which any matter is required by law to be reduced to the form of a

document, no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract, grant,

or disposition of property, or of such matter, except the document itself, or

secondary evidence of its contents in cases in which secondary evidence is

admissible under the provisions herein before contained…”

However, Exception 1 to Section 91 provides that:

“When a public officer is required by law to be appointed in writing, and when it is

shown that any particular person has acted as such officer, the writing by which he

is appointed need not be proved.”

Further, Explanation 3 clarifies:

“The statement of any document, whatever of a fact other than the facts referred to

in this section shall not preclude oral evidence as to the same fact.”

12

In the present case, the Plaintiff tendered several non-notarial documents in support of the claim,

as mentioned before at page number 09 and 10 of this judgement. These documents serve not to

contradict the terms of the deed but to support the Appellant’s assertion regarding the true nature

of the transaction—that is, the existence of a constructive trust.

In Mudiyanse v. Dissanayake [1909] 40 C.L.W. 34 the Court held that to prove the existence of

a driving licence, the licence itself must be produced. However, in the present matter, the

documents in question are not the instrument of title, but rather ancillary documents

corroborating the intent and conduct of the parties.

Therefore, the High Court’s exclusion of these documents on the basis of Section 91 reflects a

misapplication of the law, particularly in failing to recognise the relevance of oral and secondary

evidence under the exceptions and explanations provided within the section.

Turning to Section 92, it provides:

“When the terms of any such contract, grant, or disposition of property have been

proved under the previous section, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement

shall be admitted between the parties or their representatives in interest for the

purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from its terms.”

However, Proviso (4) to Section 92 is directly applicable to this case:

“The existence of any distinct subsequent oral agreement to rescind or modify any

such contract, grant, or disposition of property may be proved, except in cases in

which such contract, grant, or disposition of property is by law required to be in

writing, or has to be registered according to the law in force for the time being as to

the registration of documents.”

This exception was affirmed in the landmark case of Thivanipillai v. Sinnapillai [1921] 2 NLR

316, where the Court accepted oral evidence to prove that a transfer of property was made on the

oral condition that it would later be transferred to the transferee’s son after repayment of a loan.

The Court recognised that oral evidence was sufficient to prove the existence of a trust in that

instance.

13

Applying this reasoning to the present case, the letter authored by the 1st Respondent’s father,

who acted as an agent and acknowledged the real purpose of the transfer, is critical. This letter,

along with the surrounding oral and documentary evidence, clearly supports the existence of a

trust arrangement.

Hence, the refusal of the District Court and the High Court to admit or consider this evidence

under Sections 91 and 92 represents a fundamental error of law. Both courts failed to properly

apply the statutory exceptions and judicial precedents, and thereby erred in dismissing relevant

and admissible evidence that establishes the true intention of the parties.

I will now proceed to the third question of Law on which leave has been granted namely

Whether the High Court of the Central Province erred in law by failing to consider that

parol evidence can be admitted to establish a constructive trust.

The key issue is whether the High Court was correct in excluding parol evidence on the basis of

Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance, without giving due consideration to the legal framework applicable to constructive

trusts under the Trusts Ordinance.

His Lordship Justice Dheeraratne, in the case of Dayawathi and Others v. Gunasekara and

Another [1991] 1 SLR 115, held as follows:

“The Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance do

not bar parole evidence to prove a constructive trust and that the transferor did not

intend to pass the beneficial interest in the property.”

The distinction regarding parole evidence was elaborated in the case of Mercantile Bank v.

Taylor [1891] 12 LR (NSW) 252 at 262, where it was stated:

“The Parol Evidence Rule is a substantive rule of law that operates to bar the

introduction of evidence intended to show that the parties had agreed to something

different from what they finally arrived at and wrote down. It applies prior to written

as well as oral discussions that do not make it into the final agreement. But the parol

14

evidence rule does support rectification, partly oral and partly written contracts and

collateral contract.”

Despite the restrictions under Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Sections 91

and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance No. 14 of 1895, parol evidence may still be admitted in

limited circumstances. However, Section 5(1) of the Trusts Ordinance No. 9 of 1917 imposes a

mandatory requirement that a declaration of trust concerning immovable property must be

notarially executed. The section provides:

“Subject to the provisions of section 107 of the Trusts Ordinance, no trust in relation

to immovable property is valid unless declared by the last will of the author of the

trust or of the trustee, or by a non-testamentary instrument in writing signed by the

author of the trust or the trustee, and notarially executed.”

However, as emphasised by Justice Samayawardhena in Hewa Abeywickrama vs Sugath

Nandana in SC/APPEAL/18/2021 decided on 17/11/2022, parol evidence is nevertheless

admitted to establish a constructive trust despite the express provisions in the Prevention of

Frauds Ordinance and the Evidence Ordinance:

“In addition, section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, No. 7 of 1840, and

sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance, No. 14 of 1895, mandate that

transactions in relation to immovable property be notarially executed and that no

oral evidence is permitted to be led to contradict such documents. Despite the above

express provisions, parol evidence is nevertheless admitted to establish a

constructive trust. This is justified on different grounds. The Trusts Ordinance was

enacted subsequent to the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and the Evidence

Ordinance and therefore in the event of a conflict, the later Act should prevail.

Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition, page 193 states ‘If,

however, the provisions of a later enactment are so inconsistent with or repugnant to

the provisions of an earlier one that the two cannot stand together, the earlier is

abrogated by the later.”

15

Bernadette Vanlangenberg v. Hapuarachchige Anthony [1990] 1 Sri LR 190 at 202 also

highlighted this principle, where the Supreme Court held that:

“Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance is applicable only to the trusts

created under Chapter II of the Trusts Ordinance and not to the constructive trusts

created under Chapter IX of the Trusts Ordinance.”

Further, Section 5(3) of the Trusts Ordinance provides an important exception:

“These rules do not apply where they would operate so as to effectuate a fraud.”

This exception was applied in Ehiya Lebbe v. Majeed [1947] 48 NLR 357, establishing that

where fraud is alleged, the formal requirements are relaxed—even an oral agreement can be

sufficient.

In Valliyammai Atchi v. Abdul Majeed [1947] 48 NLR 289, the Privy Council held:

“The formalities required to constitute a valid trust relating to land are to be found

in section 5 of the Trusts Ordinance and not in section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance; that the act of the widow in seeking to ignore the trust and to retain the

property for the estate was to effectuate a fraud; that, therefore, under section 5(3)

of the Trusts Ordinance even a writing was unnecessary and sections 91 and 92 of

the Evidence Ordinance had no application.”

Thus, section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, which requires notarial execution of

instruments relating to immovable property, cannot be used as a shield for fraud. In constructive

trust cases, it is often permissible to rely on non-notarial documents or parol evidence that reveal

the true intention of the parties.

Moreover, the first proviso to Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance explicitly allows the

admission of parol evidence where the purpose is to invalidate a document on the basis of fraud,

mistake, etc. It states:

“Any fact may be proved which would invalidate any document, or which would

entitle any person or order relating thereto, such as fraud, intimidation, illegality,

16

want of due execution, want of capacity in any contracting party, the fact that it is

wrongly dated, want or failure of consideration, or mistake in fact or law.”

Turning to the facts of this case, during cross-examination, the 1st Respondent provided

contradicting answers about the property. The only document that supported his claim to

beneficial interest was the Deed of Transfer No. 2357. In contrast, the Appellant presented a

substantial body of evidence, including:

1.​ Oral testimony from multiple witnesses stating that the Appellant used the said property

to secure loans;

2.​ Testimony from a witness who also signed the said deed;

3.​ A set of non-notarial documents including:

○​ A letter from the 1st Respondent’s father (acting as agent) P15,

○​ An affidavit from a Justice of the Peace (Deputy Chairman of the Udapalatha

Provincial Council) P29,

○​ A confirmation letter from an Agrarian Department official P30.

○​ Tax payment receipts to the Agrarian Department made even after the said

transfer P22 to 28.

○​ Caveat filed by the Appellant on behalf of the Property P16

These documents and testimonies collectively demonstrate the continued beneficial interest of

the Appellant in the property and strongly suggest the presence of fraud or mistake.

Accordingly, under the legal principles established in the above landmark cases and statutory

provisions, there is no legal impediment to leading parol evidence to establish a constructive

trust or to reveal the true nature of the transaction. The High Court’s failure to consider this legal

position amounts to an error of law.

I will now proceed to answer the 4th question of law on which leave has been granted namely:

Did the High Court of the Central Province arrive at an erroneous conclusion that the

Petitioner cannot proceed with the case in view of the third admission between the parties?

Third Admission of the parties reads as follows;

17

පැමිණිල්ලේ 18 වන ජේදයේ සදහන් පරිදි 1 වන විත්තිකරු දේපළ සින්නක්කරයේ පවරාගන්නට

යෙදුනු බව පිළිගනී .

The aforesaid Paragraph 18 of the plaint reads as follows;

පැමිණිලිකාරියගේ ස්වාමිපුරුෂයාගේ අසනීප තත්වය උත්සන්නවීමෙන් ඇයට තවත් මුදල් අවශ්‍ය වූ

අතර විත්තිකරුගේ පියා වන තෙගිරිස් අප්පුහාමි යන අයගෙන් රු.60000 ක් මුදලක් ලබාගැනීමට

සාකච්ඡා කල අතර විත්තිකරුගේ පියා එකී මුදල ගෙවීමට එකගවුයේ එකී දේපළ විත්තිකරුගේ

නමින් ලියවා මසකට පොලිය වශයෙන් රු.3000 බැගින් ගෙවීමේ කොන්දේසිය මතය.

Paragraph 18 states the ground and the circumstances for the said transfer which is a loan of

Rs.60,000 obtained from the 1st Respondent's father subject to the monthly interest of Rs.3000.

As per the written submissions of the Appellant, the 1st Respondent has admitted that the said

transaction took place according to the circumstances set out in paragraph 18 of the plaint.

Therefore the 1st Respondent has admitted that it was not an outright transfer and it was only

transferred as a security for the loan obtained. It is evident that, when considering paragraph 18

as a whole, the 3rd admission is based on the facts set out in paragraph 18 of the plaint. The

circumstances of this loan is further confirmed by the letter sent by the 1st Respondent's father

Thediris Appuhmay marked P15 confirming the surrounding circumstances of the loan

arrangement, blaming the priest for the introduction of the Appellant.

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance provides:

“Where the owner of the property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot be

reasonably be inferred consistently with the attendant circumstances that he

intended to dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must

hold such property for the benefit of the owner or his legal representative.”

In Piyasena v. Don Vansue [1997] 2 Sri LR 311, the Court held:

“A trust is inferred from attendant circumstances. The trust is an obligation imposed

by law on those who try to camouflage the actual nature of the transaction. When

the attendant circumstances point to a loan transaction and not a genuine sale

transaction the provisions of section 83 of the Trust Ordinance apply.”

18

Applying the above principles to the facts of this case, although the Learned District Judge based

the decision on the third admission, and the Learned High Court Judge upheld that decision, it is

my opinion that both courts failed to adequately analyse the legal effect and depth of that third

admission.

The 1st Respondent, in his answer, contended that the Appellant failed to prove the contents of

Paragraph 18 of the plaint. However, the Appellant submitted credible supporting documents,

including the prescriptions issued to her husband (P31 to 36) and his death certificate (P37), both

of which correspond to the relevant time period. In addition, there is no legal bar to the

admission of parol evidence supporting the Appellant’s position.

When considered in this context, the third admission—rather than undermining the Appellant’s

case—reinforces the existence of a hidden beneficial interest in the property. That interest

appears to be buried beneath the surface of the Deed bearing No. 2357, which, on its face, shows

legal title in the name of the 1st Respondent.

Furthermore, Section 84 of the Trusts Ordinance states:

“Where the property is transferred to one person for a consideration paid or

provided by another person, and it appears that such other person did not intend to

pay or provide such consideration for the benefit of the transferee, the transferee

must hold the property for the benefit of the person paying or providing the

consideration.”

Section 58 of the Evidence Ordinance states that:

“No fact need to be proved in any proceeding which the parties thereto or their agents agree to

admit at the hearing, or which, before the hearing they agree to admit any writing under their

hands, or which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are deemed to have admitted in

pleadings;

Provided that the Court may, in its discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise

than by such admission”.

19

According to this section, a fact may be admitted at three stages: (i) during the hearing or trial,

(ii) prior to the commencement of the hearing or trial, or (iii) through the pleadings. In the

present case, the admission regarding paragraph 18 of the plaint was made on the very first day

of the trial. As this express admission was entered at the hearing, it is admissible under section

58 of the Evidence Ordinance. Consequently, there is no requirement to present further

evidence to establish that fact.

According to the available facts, including both oral testimony and non-notarial documentary

evidence, and even based on the 1st Respondent’s own admission regarding the handwriting of

his father, it is evident that the property was transferred in the name of the 1st Respondent, but

the consideration was paid or provided by his father.

Accordingly, the son holds the legal title in trust for the father, who is the real beneficiary.

Therefore, the letter written by the father, which was produced as part of the plaint, serves as key

evidence in demonstrating the Appellant's beneficial interest in the property.

In summary, relying solely on the third admission without considering the surrounding

circumstances and available evidence led the High Court to an erroneous conclusion. A proper

application of sections 83 and 84 of the Trusts Ordinance—together with the attendant

circumstances—clearly supports the Appellant’s right to proceed with the claim.

I will proceed to the final question of law on which leave has been granted, namely that Did the

Courts below err in drawing correct inferences from the attendant circumstances which

clearly point to the fact that there was no intention to dispose of the beneficial interest by

the Petitioner?

In Muttammah v. Thiyagaraja [62 NLR 559 at p.564], Chief Justice Basnayake, interpreting the

term “attendant circumstances” under Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance, stated:

“Attendant circumstances are, to my mind, circumstances which precede or follow

the transfer but are not too far removed in point of time to be regarded as attendant,

which expression in this context may be understood as ‘accompanying’ or

‘connected with.’ Whether a circumstance is attendant or not would depend on the

facts of each case.”

20

In the present case, the Appellant has pointed to several such attendant circumstances that clearly

demonstrate there was no intention to part with the beneficial interest in the property:

1.​ Past Pattern of Transactions:​

The Petitioner had previously entered into similar loan arrangements without transferring

beneficial interest. She would temporarily transfer the title as security and have it

re-transferred after repayment of the loan. Attachments P1 to P13 document this pattern.

Furthermore, one of the previous lenders who had held the title under such an

arrangement gave evidence in support of the Appellant.​

The 1st Respondent argued that had the impugned Deed No. 2357 truly been subject to an

agreement to retransfer, such an intention would have been recorded in the deed itself.

However, a comparison of the Respondent’s arguments with prior lenders’

actions—when considered together with the attendant circumstances—calls for analysis

under the reasonable person test.

2.​ Health and Financial Need:​

The Appellant’s husband was critically ill at the time of the transaction, a fact supported

by his subsequent death and related documents. This further supports the Appellant’s

claim that the transfer was made in urgent need of money, not with the intention of

passing beneficial ownership.

3.​ Similar Prior Transactions:​

By Deeds No. 8679 and 2339, the Appellant had previously transferred the same property

to Hathurusinghe and Cyril Gamage under loan arrangements. These past dealings further

confirm her consistent pattern of not intending to dispose of beneficial interest.

4.​ Involvement of Religious Leader:​

In need of further funds, the Appellant approached Chief Priest Rev. Atabage

Sumanathissa, who introduced her to the 1st Respondent’s father, Thegiris Appuhamy, as

evidenced in Attachment P15. The priest was also a witness to Deed No. 2357.

5.​ Uncontested Testimony:​

The said priest testified in favour of the Appellant, and his testimony was not challenged

under cross-examination, thereby strengthening the Appellant's case.

6.​ Letter from the 1st Respondent’s Father:​

A letter written by the 1st Respondent’s father (marked P15) was produced in court,

21

blaming the priest for introducing the Appellant. It provides context to the transaction and

supports the Appellant’s claim that this was a loan, not a genuine sale. The 1st

Respondent admitted under cross-examination that the handwriting was his father’s.

Collectively, these circumstances clearly indicate that the Appellant did not intend to transfer

beneficial ownership. The lower courts erred in failing to draw appropriate legal inferences from

these facts.

Another significant point to consider is the conduct of the 2nd Respondent.

According to Deed No. 10719 (P39), executed on 19.03.2002, after the filing of the Appellant’s

plaint in the District Court of Gampola—the 2nd Respondent is the person who allegedly holds

the beneficial interest in the property. As stated in Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the Appellant’s

written submissions to the Supreme Court, the transfer of the property by the 1st Respondent to

the 2nd Respondent is alleged to be a sham transaction. Although the 2nd Respondent was

named as a defendant, she failed to appear before court and made no effort to pursue the case and

defend her title.

It is noteworthy that the attesting witnesses to Deed No. 10719 are the fathers of both the 1st and

2nd Respondents. Moreover, this deed was executed shortly after the initiation of the legal action

by the Appellant.

In response, the 1st Respondent, in his written submissions, argues that the 2nd Respondent was

permitted to intervene in the original case on the basis that Deed No. 10719 had been executed

prior to the service of summons in the District Court action. Accordingly, it was claimed that the

property described in the schedule to the plaint had already been transferred to the 2nd

Respondent.

Furthermore, the 1st Respondent contends that even after the intervention of the 2nd Respondent,

the Appellant did not amend the plaint to include any relief against the 2nd Respondent. As such,

the Appellant failed to assert that the 2nd Respondent held the property in a constructive trust in

her favour.

22

Additionally, by citing Section 98 of the Trusts Ordinance No. 9 of 1917, the 1st Respondent

argues that the 2nd Respondent qualifies as a bona fide purchaser. Section 98 provides:

"Nothing contained in this Chapter shall impair the rights of transferees in good

faith for valuable consideration, or create an obligation in evasion of any law for

the time being in force."

It is well accepted that a beneficiary under a trust has a personal remedy against a trustee for loss

caused by a breach of the trust. Section 65 (1) of the Trust Ordinance provides an additional

remedy to a beneficiary to follow the trust property into the hands of a third party where trust

property has been disposed of by the trustee. This section enacts that where property comes into

the hands of a third party inconsistently with the trust, the beneficiary may institute a suit for a

declaration that the property is comprised in the trust. Though the remedy available to the

beneficiary is merely a declaration, this would effectively prevent the third party (transferee)

from exercising his proprietary rights in respect of the property. It is significant that Section 66

(1) makes provisions for a third party to obtain the property free of the trust on proof of certain

circumstances. This section lays down that nothing in Section 65 (1) entitles the beneficiary to

any right in respect of the property in the hands of a transferee who in good faith for

consideration purchases the property without notice of the trust either when the purchase money

was paid or when the conveyance was executed.

However, when analysing the facts of this case in light of the above provision, the question arises

as to whether the 2nd Respondent truly acted in good faith. According to the oral evidence and

submissions before the District Court, the actual value of the land was approximately Rs.

500,000. In contrast, Deed No. 2357 reflects a transaction for Rs. 60,000, while Deed No. 10719

states a purchase price of Rs. 125,000.

In this context, the validity of the transaction under Deed No. 10719 may be questioned under

the Doctrine of Laesio Enormis, which allows a seller to rescind a contract if the sale price is less

than half the fair market value of the property, or gives the buyer the option of paying the

difference.

23

The significant undervaluation of the property, combined with the 2nd Respondent’s minimal

participation in court proceedings, raises doubts about her good faith and whether the deed

represents a genuine transaction or a sham intended to defeat the Appellant’s claim.

Another important factor is the close relationship between the families of the 1st and 2nd

Respondents. According to the case record, three and a half years after the transaction under

Deed No. 2357, which was executed for a loan of Rs. 60,000, the 1st Respondent—along with

the 2nd Respondent’s father—entered the disputed property, damaged its vegetation, and

destroyed the tombstones of the Appellant’s in-laws situated on the land. A police complaint was

lodged regarding this incident and is included in the record as attachment P20.

These facts strongly suggest that the 2nd Respondent was aware of the Appellant’s true

beneficial interest in the property prior to the execution of Deed No. 10719.

Moreover, Deed No. 10719 refers only to Cyril Gamage as the previous beneficiary, whereas

Deed No. 2357 lists Hathurusinghe, Cyril Gamage, and the Appellant as beneficiaries. This

inconsistency further undermines the claim of good faith on the part of the 2nd Respondent.

Therefore, the 2nd Respondent cannot rely on the protection provided under Section 98 of the

Trusts Ordinance No. 9 of 1917. Consequently, both the 1st and 2nd Respondents must be

deemed to hold the property on constructive trust in favour of the Appellant.

Given the above circumstances and legal principles, the District Court and High Court judgments

were erroneous. The courts failed to properly interpret and apply Sections 83 and 98 of the Trusts

Ordinance, and to appreciate the relevance of the attendant circumstances.

Therefore, I answer all five questions of law on which leave was granted in the affirmative. I set

aside the judgments of the High Court of the Central Province and the District Court of

Gampola.

I order the reconveyance of the property by the 2nd Respondent to the Appellant upon repayment

of an amount Rs. 60,000/- with an interest rate of 12% per year from the date of the judgement of

the District Court of Gampola (dated 02.12.2013) within a period of one year from this

judgment, to the 1st Respondent; and In the event the either of the Respondent fails to comply,

24

direct the Registrar of the District Court of Gampola to execute the necessary steps to retransfer

the property to the Appellant.

Appeal Allowed.
