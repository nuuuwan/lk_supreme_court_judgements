"The  significant  undervaluation  of  the  property,  combined  with  the  2nd  Respondent’s  minimal"
"participation  in  court  proceedings,  raises  doubts  about  her  good  faith  and  whether  the  deed"
"represents a genuine transaction or a sham intended to defeat the Appellant’s claim."
"Another  important  factor  is  the  close  relationship  between  the  families  of  the  1st  and  2nd"
"Respondents.  According  to  the  case  record,  three  and  a  half  years  after  the  transaction  under"
"Deed No. 2357, which was executed for a loan of Rs. 60,000, the 1st   Respondent—along with"
"the  2nd  Respondent’s 
father—entered 
the  disputed  property,  damaged 
its  vegetation,  and"
"destroyed the tombstones of the Appellant’s in-laws situated on the land. A police complaint was"
"lodged regarding this incident and is included in the record as attachment P20."
"These  facts  strongly  suggest 
that 
the  2nd  Respondent  was  aware  of 
the  Appellant’s 
true"
"beneficial interest in the property prior to the execution of Deed No. 10719."
"Moreover,  Deed  No.  10719  refers  only  to  Cyril  Gamage  as  the  previous  beneficiary,  whereas"
"Deed  No.  2357  lists  Hathurusinghe,  Cyril  Gamage,  and  the  Appellant  as  beneficiaries.  This"
"inconsistency further undermines the claim of good faith on the part of the 2nd Respondent."
"Therefore,  the  2nd  Respondent  cannot  rely  on  the  protection  provided under Section 98 of the"
"Trusts  Ordinance  No.  9  of  1917.  Consequently,  both  the  1st  and  2nd  Respondents  must  be"
"deemed to hold the property on constructive trust in favour of the Appellant."
"Given the above circumstances and legal principles, the District Court and High Court judgments"
"were erroneous. The courts failed to properly interpret and apply Sections 83 and 98 of the Trusts"
"Ordinance, and to appreciate the relevance of the attendant circumstances."
"Therefore, I answer all five questions of law on which leave was granted in the affirmative. I set"
"aside 
the 
judgments  of 
the  High  Court  of  the  Central  Province  and  the  District  Court  of"
"Gampola."
"I order the reconveyance of the property by the 2nd Respondent to the Appellant upon repayment"
"of an amount Rs. 60,000/- with an interest rate of 12% per year from the date of the judgement of"
"the  District  Court  of  Gampola  (dated  02.12.2013)  within  a  period  of  one  year  from  this"
"judgment,  to  the 1st Respondent; and In the event the either of the Respondent fails to comply,"
