"","1.  Past Pattern of Transactions:",""
"","","The Petitioner had previously entered into similar loan arrangements without transferring"
"","beneficial","interest.  She  would 
temporarily 
transfer 
the 
title  as  security  and  have  it"
"","","re-transferred after repayment of the loan. Attachments P1 to P13 document this pattern."
"","Furthermore,  one  of","the  previous 
lenders  who  had  held 
the 
title  under  such  an"
"","arrangement gave evidence in support of the Appellant.",""
"","","The 1st Respondent argued that had the impugned Deed No. 2357 truly been subject to an"
"","","agreement  to  retransfer,  such  an  intention  would  have  been  recorded  in  the deed itself."

"","passing beneficial ownership.",""
"","3.  Similar Prior Transactions:",""
"","","By Deeds No. 8679 and 2339, the Appellant had previously transferred the same property"
"","","to Hathurusinghe and Cyril Gamage under loan arrangements. These past dealings further"
"","confirm her consistent pattern of not intending to dispose of beneficial interest.",""
"4.","Involvement of Religious Leader:",""
"","In 
need","of 
further 
funds, 
the  Appellant  approached  Chief  Priest  Rev.  Atabage"
"","","Sumanathissa, who introduced her to the 1st Respondent’s father, Thegiris Appuhamy, as"
