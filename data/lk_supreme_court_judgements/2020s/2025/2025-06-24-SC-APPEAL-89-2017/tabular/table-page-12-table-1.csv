"The High Court, in its reasoning, limited itself to a review of the documentation and relied solely"
"on the third condition. It failed to consider the substantial body of oral evidence and supporting"
"non notarial documentation which clearly illustrated the existence of a constructive trust."
"Even in the absence of a formal agreement, the letter from Thegiris Appuhamy—acknowledged"
"by  the  1st  Respondent  as  his  father’s  handwriting—demonstrates  the  real  intention  behind  the"
"transaction.  It  provides  compelling  evidence  that  the  deed  masked a constructive trust, and the"
"transfer was not absolute."
"I  will  now  proceed  to  answer  the  second  question  of  Law  on  which  leave  has  been  granted"
"namely  Whether  the  High  Court  of  the  Central  Province  erred in law by concluding that"
"only secondary evidence could be led under Sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance."
"To  address  this  question,  it  is  essential  to  analyse  the  wording  of  Section  91  of the Evidence"
"Ordinance:"
