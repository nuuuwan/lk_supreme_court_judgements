"Bernadette  Vanlangenberg  v.  Hapuarachchige  Anthony  [1990]  1  Sri  LR  190  at  202  also"
"highlighted this principle, where the Supreme Court held that:"
"“Section  2  of  the  Prevention  of  Frauds  Ordinance  is  applicable  only  to  the  trusts"
"created  under  Chapter II of the Trusts Ordinance and not to the constructive trusts"
"created under Chapter IX of the Trusts Ordinance.”"
"Further, Section 5(3) of the Trusts Ordinance provides an important exception:"
"“These rules do not apply where they would operate so as to effectuate a fraud.”"
"This  exception  was  applied  in  Ehiya  Lebbe  v.  Majeed  [1947]  48  NLR  357,  establishing  that"
"where  fraud  is  alleged,  the  formal  requirements  are  relaxed—even  an  oral  agreement  can  be"
"sufficient."
"In Valliyammai Atchi v. Abdul Majeed [1947] 48 NLR 289, the Privy Council held:"
"“The formalities required to constitute a valid trust relating to land are to be found"
"in section 5 of the Trusts Ordinance and not in section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds"
"Ordinance; that the act of the widow in seeking to ignore the trust and to retain the"
"property  for the estate was to effectuate a fraud; that, therefore, under section 5(3)"
"of  the  Trusts  Ordinance even a writing was unnecessary and sections 91 and 92 of"
"the Evidence Ordinance had no application.”"
"Thus,  section  2  of  the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, which requires notarial execution of"
"instruments relating to immovable property, cannot be used as a shield for fraud. In constructive"
"trust cases, it is often permissible to rely on non-notarial documents or parol evidence that reveal"
"the true intention of the parties."
"Moreover,  the  first  proviso  to  Section  92  of  the  Evidence  Ordinance  explicitly  allows  the"
"admission of parol evidence where the purpose is to invalidate a document on the basis of fraud,"
"mistake, etc. It states:"
"“Any  fact  may  be  proved  which  would  invalidate  any  document,  or  which  would"
"entitle  any  person  or  order  relating  thereto,  such  as  fraud, intimidation, illegality,"
