This appeal deals with a situation where the judgment pronounced by the

District Court in favour of the substituted Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant

(hereinafter the parties would be referred to in their original status before the

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

4

trial Court) in a partition action and was subsequently set aside by the Court of

Appeal and ordering a re-trial, upon an appeal preferred by the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants and the questions of law that arose in those circumstances requiring

determination by this Court.

The Plaintiff instituted the instant action in the District Court of Avissawella

on 31.08.1981, seeking an order from that Court to partition a contiguous land

called Medaheenna alias Millagahawatta and Millagaha Watta, which is in extent of

about 1 Acre and 17 Perches and depicted as lot Nos. 157 and 163 of the title plan

No. S 10230. The pedigree on which he relied in the said action, in support of his

devolution of title, indicates that the original owners of the said land were

Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Robert Marambe, Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Sampy

Bandara and Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Somawathie, each holding an undivided

1/3rd shares of the corpus. The Plaintiff therefore claims that the only defendant

he named in the Plaint, Wilson Eheliyagoda, who derived title from his mother

Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Somawathie is entitled to 1/3rd share of the land, while

he is entitled to the remaining 2/3rd shares, on the strength of Deeds of Transfer

No.309 and 315, executed on 20.11.1974 and 26.11.1974 respectively by said

Weerasinghe Muiyanselage Robert Marambe and Weerasinghe Muiyanselage Sampy

Bandara.

In his Statement of Claim, Wilson Eheliyagoda conceded to the Plaintiff’s

claim of 2/3rd shares and moved Court either to dismiss the Plaint or if the

partition is ordered, to allocate a 1/3rd share of the corpus to him. The District

Court issued the commission on licensed surveyor S.R.A. Jayasinghe on

25.05.1983, who then reported back to Court that, upon his visit to the corpus on

05.01.1983, two persons, Pathirannehelage Piyadasa and Pathirannehelage Ariyadasa

have objected for surveying the land. The Court thereupon issued notice on two

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

5

of them. They were subsequently added as 2nd and 3rd Defendants to the instant

partition action on 07.06.1985.

When the surveyor visited the land for the purpose of the preliminary

survey, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants have claimed that they are in possession of the

land since 1941. They, having showed the boundaries to the surveyor during the

said survey, in their amended joint Statement of Claim admitted the identity of

the corpus, in addition to admitting the original ownership of Weerasinghe

Mudiyanselage Robert Marambe, Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Sampy Bandara and

Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Somawathie, who derived their title to the same on

paternal inheritance and also by virtue of a Settlement Order. However, these

two Defendants have claimed that the Plaintiff did not possess the corpus even

for a day and whatever the title deed he relied on, in support of his claim, is a

nullity and does not pass any title to him. They also claimed acquisition of

prescriptive title by possessing the corpus for a period of more than ten years

since coming into its possession on 10.02.1941. They further alleged that they

have planted rubber on that land under permits issued by Rubber Control

Department, bearing No. 139 AS 1 R 128. They also presented an alternative

pedigree by claiming that Mudiyanselage Robert Marambe, Weerasinghe

Mudiyanselage Sampy Bandara and Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Somawathie have

transferred all their rights in favour of Hettiarachchilage Podi Menike alias Punchi

Menike by Deed of Sale No. 360, by executing the same on 10.02.1941.

Podi Menike and her husband Pathirennehelage Brampy Singho, have

thereupon transferred their rights over the corpus in favour of the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants by the Deed of Transfer No. 847 executed on 02.05.1976. These two

Defendants specifically claim in their joint Statement of Claim that neither the

Plaintiff nor the 1st Defendant Wilson Eheliyagoda are entitled to any share to the

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

6

corpus and only they are entitled to the corpus in its entirety. The only substantial

relief sought from Court by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants was the dismissal of the

Plaint and, in case the Court decides otherwise, they sought compensation for

improvement, made by planting rubber, valued at Rs. 150,000.00.

After filing his Statement of Claim, the 1st Defendant did not appear before

the District Court Nor was he represented by Counsel. Neither did he take part

in the trial nor raise any Points of Contest on the position taken up by him in his

Statement of Claim. Of the nine Points of Contest, on which the Plaintiff and the

2nd and 3rd Defendants have proceeded to trial, the District Court, at the

conclusion of the trial, answered the Points of Contest Nos. 1 to 5 in favour of the

Plaintiff after accepting the devolution of title pleaded by him. The District Court

accordingly held that the Plaintiff is entitled to partition of the corpus, in line with

the share allocation made in the Plaint. Due to the absence of 1st Defendant’s

participation in the trial, his 1/3rd share entitlement, in terms of the share

entitlement of the Plaint, was kept unallotted.

The Points of Contest Nos. 6 to 9 were raised by the Defendant. Point of

Contest No. 7 dealt with the question whether the original owners have

transferred their rights to the corpus to Podi Menike by execution of the Deed of

Sale No. 360 dated 10.02.1941 (“P6”), while the Point of Contest No. 9 was raised

on the basis of their claim of prescription to the corpus. The Court, at the

conclusion of its judgment had answered these two Points of Contest against the

2nd and 3rd Defendants. In relation to Point of Contest No. 7, the Court found that

although the deed No. 360 had been executed prior to the deeds relied on by the

Plaintiff, it did not pass any title to the transferee; whilst holding in relation to

Point of Contest No. 9 that the claim of prescription had not been established by

the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

7

The District Court, in answering the Point of Contest No. 7 in the negative,

did not accept the submissions of the 2nd to 3rd Defendants, who relied on the

application of the principle in Roman Dutch Law known as exceptio rei vinditae et

traditae, in support of their claim for title. The original Court rejected that

submission, primarily on the basis that the said principle of law had no

application against a recipient who received title in terms of a Settlement Order

issued under the Land Settlement Ordinance, following the dicta of the judgment

of Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed (1958) 60 NLR 352, and therefore held that the

title of the land did not devolve on their predecessors in title, despite the

execution of the Deed of Sale No. 360 (“P6”). The Court further stated that, in

arriving at the said conclusion, it also considered the fact that the relevant

Gazette notification containing the Settlement Order had been issued on

16.01.1948 and, in terms of Section 8 of the said Ordinance, all previous

encumbrances over that particular parcel of land deemed is to have been

extinguished. Therefore, the Court proceeded on the basis that when the two of

the three original owners have transferred their respective shares over the corpus

in favour of the Plaintiff by executing the Deeds of Transfer No. 309 and 315 in

his favour, he is entitled to the 2/3rd shares claimed and held by them.

In rejecting the claim of prescription pleaded by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants

and in answering the Point of Contest No. 9 as “not proved”, the District Court

was of the view that the evidence presented by them in relation to planting

rubber in the land for the past 27 years did not disclose that they in fact relate to

the corpus and therefore they failed to establish their claim over that land.

The 2nd and 3rd Defendants have appealed against the said judgment of the

District Court to the Court of Appeal in CA Appeal No. 460/1999 (F). They

challenged the validity of the said conclusions reached by the District Court,

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

8

particularly on the Points of Contest Nos. 7 and 9. The Court of Appeal, by its

judgment dated 11.05.2011 and impugned by these proceedings, held the District

Court erred in determining not to afford the benefit of the principle of rei venditae

et traditae to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. However, the appellate Court, after

setting aside the judgment of the District Court on the premise that the evidence

of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants were not properly considered by Court below in

relation to their claim of acquisition of prescriptive title, decided to remit the case

back to the District Court by ordering a re-trial.

Thereupon, the Plaintiff sought leave from this Court seeking to set aside

the judgment of the Court of Appeal. This Court decided to hear the appeal on

the following questions of law;

I. In view of the decision in 60 NLR 352 and in 47NLR 121 was the Court

of Appeal wrong in coming to the decision that the learned District

Judge had erred when she decided not to afford the benefit of the

principle exception rei venditae et traditae to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants?

II. Was the Court of Appeal wrong in law in not following the decision in

60 NLR 352 and in 47 NLR 121?

III. Was the Court of Appeal wrong in coming to the conclusion that since

the Respondent excepted the corpus in the Plaint there was no legal

burden cast on the Respondent to super-impose the land described in

the schedule to the Plaint and their Title Deed which was marked as

me6 of which they owned an undivided share was then the legal duty

cast on the Respondent to identify the land described in the schedule to

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

9

the plaint falls within the land described in Deed me6 and the schedule

to the Statement of Claim?

IV. Was the Court of Appeal wrong in considering the oral evidence of the

Respondent in the District Court when the documentary evidence

produced by the Respondent contradicted his oral evidence?

V. Has the Court of Appeal erred in Law in not considering the provisions

of Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance in relation to the burden of

proof?

Learned President’s Counsel for the Plaintiff contended that since his client

acquired title to the corpus after the Settlement Order was published in the

Gazette No. 9816/1948 (“P4”) and, in terms of Section 8 of the Land Settlement

Ordinance, he became “… entitled to such land or to such share of or interest in the

land free of all encumbrances whatsoever other than those specified in such order”.

Accordingly, learned Counsel invited our attention to the fact that under the said

Settlement Order published in the Gazette Lot Nos. 157 and 163 were settled on

the three original owners, namely Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Robert Marambe,

Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage Sampy Bandara and Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage

Somawathie who each held 1/3rd share of the corpus since then, until the Deeds of

Transfer Nos. 309 and 315 were executed in November 1974 in favour of him. In

support of the said contention, learned President’s Counsel relied on the

statement made by Sansoni J (as he then was) in Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed

(supra, at p. 353) to the effect that “… all rights which any other person had in this

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

10

land were wiped out by the settlement order, including any rights which Udupihilla may

have had upon his purchase from Ausadanide.”

In relation to the application of the principle; exceptio rei venditae et traditae,

learned President’s Counsel contended that since any encumbrance on the corpus

gets wiped out by the publication of the Settlement Order, the provisions of Land

Settlement Ordinance made the said principle inapplicable to the instant matter

and thus the deeds that were executed in favour of the Plaintiff remain valid in

law and convey the title it transferred in favour of the transferee.

Learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, in seeking to counter the

contention of the Plaintiff, submitted to this Court that a vendor who sells his

property without title but acquires the same, the said title subsequently acquired

would accrue to the benefit of the purchaser and those claiming through him. He

cited a long list of precedents which acted on that principle. He further

contended that the facts and reasoning adopted in Periacaruppen Chettiar v

Messrs Proprietors and Agents Ltd.(1946) 47NLR 121, are not applicable to the

determination of the instant appeal as it was held that the said principle was not

available in that instance due to the reason that the relevant deeds were not

registered. Similarly, learned Counsel contended that the decision of Karunadasa

v Abdul Hameed (supra) too is not applicable to the instant appeal as the

purchaser in that instance, one Udupihilla, was not placed in possession of the

land and the relevant section of that judgment relied on by the Plaintiff was

made by Court either erroneously or due to an oversight, as the judgment of

Periacaruppen Chettiar v Messrs Proprietors and Agents Ltd (ibid) made no such

pronouncement declaring that the said principle is not available to purchaser as

against a vendor who obtained title under the Settlement Order.

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

11

In fulfilling the mandatory requirement imposed by Section 25(1) of the

Partition Law (as amended) on the District Court, which states “ … the Court shall

examine the title of each party and shall hear and receive evidence in support thereof and

shall try and determine all questions of law and fact arising in that action in regard to the

right, share, or interest of each party to, of, or in the land to which the action relates, …”

the original Court had examined the conflicting claims presented by the Plaintiff

as well as the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, based on their respective Deeds of Transfer,

executed within a space of 33 years, by the same three original owners, in favour

of whom, an Order of Settlement published in the Gazette on 16.01.1948. It then

considered the contention advanced by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants that, in terms

of the principle of law known as exceptio rei vendiate et traditate along with the

publication of the Settlement Order in the Gazette, the title to the corpus passes

on to the purchaser, through whom they claimed to have derived their title.

The District Court was not convinced of the correctness of that contention

in law. Instead, it opted to act on the judicial precedent of Karunadasa v Abdul

Hameed (supra) and stated that the said judgment of the superior Court laid

down a principle of law and “ by; lS isoaOdka;fha jdish" ksrjq,a lsrSfï ksfh`.hlska

whs;sjdislï ,enQ oSukdlrefjl=g tfrysj Bg m%:uj whs;sh ,enQ ,enqïlrefjl=g ,nd .; fkdyels nj

meyeos,sj olajd we;’.” The relevant part of the said judgment of the then Supreme

Court (at p. 354) reads as follows:

“ … that the plea of exceptio rei venditae et traditae is not available to a

purchaser as against a vendor who obtained a settlement order after the

purchase was made.”

Although the District Court had acted solely on that pronouncement in

arriving at its conclusion, learned President’s Counsel for the Plaintiff, in

defending the same, added the provisions contained in Section 8 of the Land

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

12

Settlement Ordinance in order to provide additional support to his contention.

Learned President’s Counsel in his submissions contended that, with the

publication of the Settlement Order in the Gazette, the corpus became “free of all

encumbrances” and as a result, all of its previous titles held by the original owners

come to an end.

The Court of Appeal, in its impugned judgement, stated that it is of the

view that the District Court had fallen into serious error in arriving at the said

conclusion. The reasoning adopted by the appellate Court in forming that view

indicates that, since the judgment of Rajapakse v Fernando (1918) 20 NLR 301

laid down the principle, where a vendor sells without title but subsequently

acquires the same, that title acquired subsequently accrues to the benefit of the

purchaser the moment of its subsequent acquisition by the vendor, and therefore

“ … the appellants in this instance should have acquired title to the land once the

original owners obtained title by settlement order that was made in terms of the Land

Settlement Ordinance.” After making a reference to the judgment of Karunadasa v

Abdul Hameed (supra), and continuing on this line of reasoning, the Court of

Appeal has held that the “… issue in the aforesaid case referred by the trial Judge in

order to reject the applicability of the maxim exceptio rei vendiate et traditate is not

exactly to the point raised in this instance. In the circumstances it is seen that the learned

District Judge had not examined the facts of the respective case when she decided to

deviate from the ruling in Rajapakse v Fernando …”.

It is in view of the said determination made by the Court of Appeal and

now being impugned by the Plaintiff, this Court decided to consider the

following questions of law at the very outset of its analysis, before proceeding to

consider any other questions of law:

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

13

“In view of the decisions in 60 NLR 352 and in 47 NLR 121, was the Court

of Appeal wrong in coming to the decision that the learned District Judge

had erred when she decided not to afford the benefit of the principle exceptio

rei vendiate et traditate to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants?

Was the Court of Appeal wrong in law in not following the decision of 60

NLR 352 and in 47 NLR 121?

In the circumstances, it is important at least to make a brief reference to the

Roman-Dutch Law principle of exceptio rei vendiate et traditate, before proceeding

to consider these two questions of law in detail. In its judgment of Gunatilleke v

Fernando (1921) 22 NLR 385, this principle of law is described by the Privy

Council after reproducing a section from the text of the Commentary on the

Pandects, by Voet (at p. 390). The said section of the text reads as follows:

“ … the purchaser who had got possession from a vendor, who at the time

had no title, could rely upon a title subsequently acquired by the vendor,

not only against the vendor, but against any one claiming under the

vendor; and though delivery (traditio) was, as the title shows, a part of the

defence, if the purchaser had acquired possession without force or fraud, he

could use the exception, though he had never received actual delivery from

the vendor. Also, if he had once been in possession without force or fraud,

and had since lost possession, he could recover it by the Publician action,

using the exception as a replication to any defence set up by the vendor or

those claiming title under him.”

Having the scope, in relation to the applicability of the said principle of

law, as set out by the Privy Council, in the back of my mind, I shall now proceed

to consider the validity of the basis on which the Court of Appeal found fault

with the conclusion reached by the District Court in respect of the case presented

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

14

before it by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. If I were to put the basis on which the

Court of Appeal faulted the conclusion reached by the lower Court in a more

simpler manner, it could be described as that the original Court erroneously

opted to follow the dicta of a judgment that has no direct relevance to the facts

presented before it, which should have been distinguished from the instant

matter, while failing to follow the dicta of a judgment very relevant to the issue

presented before that Court and therefore binding on that Court. This exercise

requires a brief reference to the factual and legal aspects that were considered in

the judgments of Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed (supra), Periacaruppan Chettiar v

Messrs Proprietors and Agents Ltd (supra) and Rajapakse v Fernando (supra).

The case of Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed (supra) relates to a situation

where one Ausadnaide had transferred his rights over a particular land to one

Udupihilla in 1938. In 1940, a Settlement Order was published in the Gazette,

indicating Ausadnaide is entitled to 1/3rd share of the same land, who thereupon

transferred that share to the Plaintiff in 1953. The defendants have claimed their

right to the said land upon a transfer made in their favour by Udupihilla in 1949.

The plaintiff instituted rei vindicatio action against the defendants. The issues

framed before the trial Court were mainly on the effect of the Settlement Order,

due registration of deeds and also on prescription. The District Court held that

the 1st defendant had acquired prescriptive title to the land and also acted on the

principle of exceptio rei vendiate et traditate to hold that the subsequent acquisition

of 1/3rd share by Ausadnaide following Settlement Order enured to the benefit of

the 1st defendant.

On appeal, Sansoni J, found the approach taken by the trial Court in

determining the dispute was erroneous, as it is highly dangerous in a vindicatio

action to adjudicate on an issue of prescription without first going into and

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

15

examining the documentary title of the parties. His Lordship allowed the appeal

of the plaintiff on the premise that the trial Court paid no heed to the conclusive

effect of the Settlement Order, following the dicta of the judgment of

Periacaruppan Chettiar v Messrs Properties and Agents Ltd. (supra) where it had

been held “ … that the plea of exceptio rei venditae et traditae is not available to a

purchaser as against a vendor who obtained a Settlement Order after the purchase was

made.”

The case of Periacaruppan Chettiar v Messrs Properties and Agents Ltd.

(supra) relates to an instance where the plaintiff instituted action against the

defendants on the strength of a Settlement Order made in 1933 by which his

predecessor in title (one Gunasekera) was declared entitled to the property in

dispute. The Plaintiff relied on deeds P1, P2 and P23. The 3rd defendant relied on

the deed 3D4, executed by same vendor Gunasekera in 1928, in favour of the 1st

defendant from whom he purchased the land. The Settlement Order and the

deeds relied upon by the plaintiff were registered on the same folio of the Land

Registry whereas the deed 3D4 of the defendant was not registered at all.

The District Court accepted the defendant’s entitlement to retain the

possession of the land, until they were compensated for improvements and

dismissed the plaintiff’s action. The plaintiff as well as by the 3rd defendant

preferred appeals against the judgment of the District Court.

In delivering the judgment of Court, Howard CJ, dismissed both appeals.

On the contention presented by the defendants that the Settlement Order should

have enured in favour of the 1st defendant on deed 3D4. His Lordship was of the

view that the benefit of the application of the principle of exceptio rei venditae et

traditae is not available to the defendants on the premise that in Mudalihamy v

Dingiri Menika (1927) 28 NLR 412, Garvin J has held the view (at p. 415), that the

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

16

application of the said “ … exception must, I think, be limited to cases in which the

new title which the purchaser asserts has enured to his benefit is obtained by his vendor

by the usual means by which title is derived, such as purchase, gift, or inheritance”.

Howard CJ, in view of the said pronouncement observed that (at p. 129), “ [I]f the

exceptio is limited to the cases mentioned by Garvin J and the same principle applies to

land subject to a Settlement Order as to land subject to partition decree, … the exception

is of no vail in the present case.”

The case of Mudalihamy v Dingiri Menika (supra) deals with a situation

where the first defendant sold and transferred the interests of a land in 1913,

now claimed by the plaintiff. Thereafter, in a partition action instituted by a

person who claimed to be the owner of the eastern half of this land, sought the

partition of the whole of the land, presumably, upon the footing that the it was

one and undivided land. The present first defendant was one of the defendants

in that partition proceeding. The fact of the transfer made in 1913 was not

brought to the notice of the Court, and when the final decree was entered, a

specific allotment of land, being the equivalent of a half share of the land, was

allotted to the first defendant. The plaintiff, who was not a party to the action,

was completely excluded by the partition decree so entered. Thereafter the first

defendant transferred her interests to the second defendant. The District Judge

held that the issue on title is already concluded by the judgment in the partition

case and dismissed the plaintiff's action.

In appeal, Garvin J affirmed the judgment of the District Court. His

Lordship, in dismissing the appeal of the plaintiff, considered the application of

the principle of exceptio rei venditae et traditae in his favour and ruled that (at

p.414) “ … it is well settled law that a partition decree is conclusive against all persons

whomsoever even as against a person owing an interest in the land partitioned whose

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

17

title has by fraudulent contrivance been concealed from the Court. The effect of such a

decree is to determine all pre-existing right or title and every claim to any right or title to

the subject of partition.” His Lordship further added that (at p. 413),” [I] am aware

of no case in which it has been held that the exceptio rei venditae et traditae is available to

a purchaser who is seeking to resist his vendor or a person claiming through him upon a

title declared by the final decree in a partition action. Nor has counsel been able to refer

me to any authority for the proposition. The matter is res integra.”

Thus, the said dicta of Sansoni J, relied on by the trial Court, is founded on

the view held by Howard CJ, who in turn was persuaded by the reasoning

adopted by Garvin J, in relation to an instance where the application of the

principle of exceptio rei venditae et traditae in a matter where the rights of the

parties were already decided with finality in a partition action. It is already noted

that the judgment of Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed (supra), was pronounced

merely upon adopting the dicta of the judgment of Periacaruppan Chettiar v

Messrs Proprietors and Agents Ltd (supra).

In view of these observations, a question necessarily arises in one’s mind

whether these two judgments could have been properly distinguished from the

facts presented in relation to the instant appeal, as the Court of Appeal had

expected from the trial Court and, found fault with when it did fail in that task.

The case of Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed (supra), indicates that the case

presented before the District Court by the plaintiff was a rei vindicatio action but

it proceeded to consider the claim of prescription presented by the defendants on

the basis that they were in possession of the land in dispute, without first

examining the paper title of the parties. The Supreme Court was critical of the

approach adopted by the learned trial Judge, as he decided the dispute in favour

of the defendants primarily on the claim of acquisition of prescriptive title. It is in

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

18

this scenario only, Sansoni J stated that (at p.353), “[I]f he had directed himself

correctly he would have seen that on 19th July 1949 all rights which any other persons

had in this land were wiped out by the Settlement Order, including any rights

Udupihilla may have had upon his purchase from Ausadanaide.”

This is the very reason as to why I think that the learned President’s

Counsel for the Plaintiff invited attention of this Court to the provisions of

Section 8 of the Land Settlement Ordinance which states that with the

publication of the order, the land becomes “… free of all encumbrances…” and

therefore the principle exceptio rei venditae et traditae would not render any

assistance to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants in relation to establishing their title to

the corpus.

But an important factor that should be noted in relation to the instant

appeal is that, in the case of Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed (supra), the reference to

the factual positions in that judgment made no indication as to the manner in

which Ausadnaide is said to have “transferred” his rights to Udupihilla, before the

publication of the Settlement Order. Although an issue was raised in relation to

due registration before the trial Court, Sansoni J stated that (at p.353) “[O]n the

evidence, the question of due registration of the deeds relied on by the Plaintiff does not

arise for consideration”. It appears that the title deeds that were put in before the

trial Court as evidence in that instance, relates only to the plaintiff’s case and not

to that of the defendant. This seems to be an indication of the fact that the

“transfer” made by Ausadnaide in favour of Udupihilla was either not on a

notarialy executed document or even if it was, that transfer was not registered.

In the former case, Howard CJ observed (at p. 127) that the deed 3D4, relied

on by the defendants in seeking to counter the deeds relied on by the plaintiff

(P1, P3 and P23) was in fact not registered. But there was clear evidence before

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

19

Court that the Settlement Order and the three deeds of the plaintiff were

registered in the same folio of the Land Registry. In addition, it was noted that

the deed 3D4 is in effect a “ … transfer of the interest Gunasekere was to receive”

under the Land Settlement Ordinance and it appears to the trial Court the

plaintiff is the “bone fide purchaser for value”.

The reproduction of certain sections from the operative part of the deed

3D4 indicates that Ausadnaide had only “… covenanted that soon after the publication

of the final orders of settlement under the Waste Lands Ordinance by the Special Officer,

to execute a conformation and ratification of the sale by a duly constituted notarial deed

and also to hand over to the first defendant all title deeds”. This is indicative of the fact

that there was no traditio, a requirement that must be fulfilled in relation to the

application of the principle of exceptio rei venditae et traditae. Since this refers to

another important area for consideration in the application of the said principle,

it is necessary to revisit this aspect of the matter once more in this judgment, but

may be at a later stage.

The fact of non-registration of the instrument on which a party founded its

claim for the application of the principle exceptio rei venditae et traditae, seems to

be the common denominator in the cases of Periacaruppan Chettiar v Messrs

Proprietors and Agents Ltd (supra) and Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed (supra),

that could be considered as the main contributory factor, which the Courts acted

on, in rejecting such claims.

It is on this particular aspect, i.e., the registration of the conflicting deeds,

that was considered and acted on by the Court of Appeal, when it decided to set

aside the judgment of the District Court. The Court of Appeal stated, in reference

to the judgment of Periacaruppan Chettiar v Messrs Proprietors and Agents Ltd

(supra), that “ … the deed was executed by the defendant in that case had not been

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

20

registered whereas the settlement order of 1933 and also the subsequent deeds of the

respondent in that case had been duly registered. Non registration of the deed was the

reason in that instance to disregard the title of the person who had a deed in his favour

before the settlement order was made.” It further added that “ … it is seen that the

issue in the aforesaid case referred to by the trial Judge in order to reject the applicability

of the maxim exceptio rei venditae et traditae, is not exactly to the point raised in this

instance.” Thus, the Court of Appeal was of the view that the judgment of

Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed (supra), which is dependent on the dicta of

Periacaruppan Chettiar v Messrs Proprietors and Agents Ltd (supra) is

distinguishable from the facts of the instant appeal and therefore the principles

enunciated in it could not be applied to determine the dispute between the

Plaintiff and the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.

In contrast, the judgment of Rajapakse v Fernando (supra) deals with a

situation where the vendor (Thomas Carry), who had no title at that point in time,

sold a parcel of land to two others in 1909, through whom the defendant

acquired title in 1915 and went into possession, as the 2nd and 3rd Defendants did

in the instant appeal. The deed of 1909 was registered in folio F 68/253. The

vendor subsequently obtained a Crown grant in 1912, and the property was sold

in execution against him, following a Court order and was purchased in 1916 by

the plaintiff's predecessor in title. But the Crown grant was registered in a

different folio, without making a reference to the previous registration of the

deed of 1909. The defendant’s position was, under the Roman-Dutch law, the

title so acquired with the Crown grant enured to his benefit, and he is entitled to

defend his possession in a suit by a subsequent purchaser of the vendor’s interest

after the date of the said Crown grant.

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

21

Shaw J, accepted that position and stated in his judgment (at p. 306) that

“[I]n my opinion the defendant is entitled to succeed on this ground.” However, his

Lordship was not so convinced of the necessity to impose a requirement of

registration of the deed in order to receive the benefit of the maxim, but

nonetheless held (at p. 307) that “ … in view of the express statement in Voet 21, 3, 3,

it appears clear that such a purchaser could, at any rate, defend his possession at the suit

of a subsequent purchaser under the plea de exceptio rei venditae et traditae.”

Ennis J, in a separate judgment, stated (at p. 307) that “[I]t is to be observed

that the property was first registered in 1909 in folio F 68/253. The subsequent Crown

grant and mortgage by Carry were registered in another folio without reference to F

68/253. In Fernando v Pedro Pulle, [2 C. W. R.75] Senaratne v Peiris, [4 C.W.R.65]

and Peris v Perera 31 A.C.R.85, it was held that the earliest registration of land

determines the place for subsequent registration. The plaintiff's documents have,

therefore, not been duly registered.”

The plaintiff appealed to the Privy Council against the said judgment of

the Supreme Court. The Privy Council, in its judgment of Rajapakse v Fernando

(1920) 21 NLR 495, delivered by Lord Moulton, stated (at p.497);

“… by the Roman-Dutch law as existing in Ceylon, the English doctrine

applies where a grantor has purported to grant an interest in land which he

did not at the time possess, but subsequently acquires, the benefit of his

subsequent acquisition goes automatically to the benefit of the earlier

grantee, or, as it usually expressed “feeds the estoppel”. When, therefore on

the 22nd February 1912, Thomas Carry acquired from the Crown the title to

the land which he had conveyed by the deed of 11th December 1909, the

benefit of that title accrues to the grantees under that deed i.e., the

respondent’s predecessor in title.”

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

22

Returning to the facts of the matter before us, the Plaintiff had tendered

the two original Deeds of Transfer Nos. 309 (“P2”), 315(“P3”), a copy of the

Gazette in which the Settlement Order was published (“P4”), a certified extract of

the folio in which all these instruments were registered (“P1”) in support of his

case. He also tendered a certified photo copy of the ‘second copy’ of the original

Deed of Sale No. 360 (“P6”), issued by the Land Registry of Ratnapura on

01.04.1986, through which the 2nd and 3rd Defendants have placed their claim

before the trial Court, for the purpose of establishing their title to the corpus. The

document “P1”, is a certified copy of the Folio No. 85, in which the details of

Settlement order, the Deeds of Transfer “P2” and “P3” were entered into. It is

undisputed that the Deed of Sale No. 360 (“P6”) too was registered in the Land

Registry, but in the absence of any reference to the same in “P1”, it could

reasonably be inferred that the deed “P6” had been registered in a different folio.

It is also understandable that, when “P6” was executed, there would not have

been any prior registration, as the recital of that deed indicates. What the vendors

have parted in “P6” is what they had “ … by right of paternal inheritance and by

right of settlement upon by Crown in Settlement Proceedings in B.S.P.P. No. 712,

Settlement Notice No. 1515 …” over the corpus.

The purpose of the Land Settlement Ordinance was to declare any land or

to any share of interest in such land in respect of which there was no claim

within the time period specified by the “settlement notice” was tendered, to be the

property of the State, which will be dealt with on account of the State (vide

Section 4). The larger land within which the defined parcel of land, the corpus in

the instant partition action is situated, was owned by the family of the original

owners for generations and they correctly call their right “by the paternal

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

23

inheritance” over the said land, in the execution of the Deed of Sale “P6”. Thus,

there could not have been any prior registration, prior to “P6”.

This vital factor makes the 2nd and 3rd Defendant’s claim on the application

of the principle of exceptio rei venditae et traditae a viable one and is a clear point

that distinguishes the instant appeal from the application of the dicta of

Periacaruppan Chettiar v Messrs Proprietors and Agents Ltd (supra), which

unfortunately had escaped the attention of the trial Court.

It is important to note that the registration is the only distinguishable

factor that made the dicta of the said judgment inapplicable. In the Full Bench

decision of Gunatilleke v Fernando et al (1919) 21 NLR 257, Bertram CJ, whilst

dealing with a similar situation held the view that (at p. 265) “… under the Roman

law no title passes upon a sale except by actual delivery to the purchaser. … This is no

longer the law. Traditio, whether actual or symbolic, is no longer necessary for the

consummation of a sale of immovable property, and has been replaced by the delivery of

the deed … The same protection, therefore, which the Roman law gave to a person who

had completed his title by possession, our own law will give to a person who has

completed his title by securing the delivery of a deed”.

In the Privy Council judgment of Gunatilleke v Fernando (1921) 22 NLR

385, the validity of the said reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court was

considered. Lord Philmore, who delivered the judgment of the Privy Council, had

reproduced the pronouncement made by the Supreme Court in dealing with the

appeal and endorsed it by stating (at p. 391) “… the view of the Chief Justice, in

which the other learned Judges concurred, was right.” The Privy Council, after

examination of the Roman Dutch law principles along with the commentaries on

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

24

the point, and after having noted the undesirability of viewing the Roman Dutch

law principles on exceptio rei venditae et traditae in the light of English law

principles on estoppel, went on to state that (at p. 391), “[A] sale made by a vendor

without title cannot be relied upon as against a purchaser from that vendor after he has

acquired title, if and so long as the earlier sale remains in contract only; but if the earlier

sale is accompanied, followed, or evidenced by certain acts which may be deemed

equivalent to the Roman traditio, that sale will prevail”. Prof G.L. Peiris, in his book

on Law of Property (Vol. 1, at p. 143) states that “[T]he decision by the Full Bench of

the Supreme Court in Gunatilleke v Fernando was endorsed by the Privy Council, and

can be regarded as settling the law of Ceylon on this point.”

In Gunatilleke v Fernando (supra), the Privy Council stated that (at p. 393)

“… for the Roman-Dutch law the question is what was the property purported to be

conveyed; and on all principles of construction the recitals can only be looked at for the

purpose of assisting the Court to arrive at the determination of the actual effect of the

conveyance.” The original owners, by execution of the Deed of Sale “P6”, have

stated that they “ … hereby sold and conveyed or expressed or intended so to be with all

and singular appurtenances thereunto belonging unto the said vendee and her heirs,

executors, administrators and assigns for ever.” It is clear in that instance as to what

the vendor and vendee have intended when executing the Deed of Sale “P6”, as

it is not a transaction which remains as a contract, but an actual sale by which the

handing over of the instrument along with the possession of the land so

conveyed. The attestation of the said Deed of Sale “P6” reads that “ … the

consideration hereof was paid in full in my presence …” by the vendee. The recitation

of the said deed also indicates that it is an outright sale of whatever the interest

the original owners had and would acquire with the publication of the

Settlement Order over the corpus. After its execution, the Deed of Sale was

delivered to the vendee and had its copy registered in the Land Registry.

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

25

There is no dispute among the parties as to the identity of the corpus. In

fact, there is an admission to that effect and it was recorded by the trial Court at

the very commencement of the trial. The surveyor, who was commissioned by

Court to present a preliminary plan, was initially prevented from entering into

the corpus by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, who convinced him that the deeds

relied on by the Plaintiff are fictitious ones. Only with the permission of the 2nd

and 3rd Defendants, the surveyor completed his commission issued by the trial

Court. The undisputed evidence presented before the trial Court indicate that the

predecessors in title of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants have taken possession of the

corpus simultaneously with the execution of the said Deed of Sale and were in

possession of the corpus since then. The Plaintiff candidly admitted that he is

fully aware that the corpus is possessed for a long time by the parents of the two

Defendants. He made this admission through his own knowledge, which he

gathered as a person who lived on a land that abuts the corpus. It is also

undisputed that the parents of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, acting under a permit

issued by the Rubber Control Department, planted rubber in that land and have

obtained the subsidies offered by the Government for a long period of time. The

nature of the ‘possession’ the Plaintiff had over the corpus is limited to picking

jack fruit from time to time. In contrast, the documents tendered by the 2nd and

3rd Defendants marked 2V1 to 2V23, indicate that the father of the two

Defendants was permitted by the Rubber Controller to plant rubber on a land

called Millagahahena in an extent of one acre commencing from the year 1943, to

which he claimed ownership under the Deed of Sale No. 360 (“P6”). The last of

the permits, 2V23 was issued in 1983, three years prior to institution of the

partition action by the Plaintiff.

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

26

This factor indeed satisfies both the requirements, as identified by the

Privy Council in the said judgment. These two requirements, as set out in that

judgment (at p. 391), are stated as follows, “[S]till the exceptio given by the Roman

law required the double conditions, not only that the property should be sold, but that it

should be delivered, though the delivery might in the case mentioned be presumed by a

fiction; …”. The evidence before the trial Court, not only satisfies the requirement

of traditio but in addition, also makes an important distinction with the factual

position considered in Periacaruppan Chettiar v Messrs Proprietors and Agents

Ltd (supra). Howard CJ, himself distinguishes the matter before their Lordship

with the factual situation of Gunatilleke v Fernando (21 NLR 495 and Rajapakse

v Fernando supra, at p. 130) by stating that “… I do not think the principles laid down

in Gunatilleke v Fernando and Rajapakse v Fernando apply”, as these are the

instances where the principle of exceptio rei venditae et traditae was applied

successfully to the party that pleaded its benefit.

The judgment of Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed (supra), is clearer on this

point. After undertaking an analysis of evidence, Sansoni J found the conclusion

reached by the trial Court on the possession of Udupihilla was made erroneously.

His Lordship concluded (at p. 354) “[I]n this state of the evidence it is apparent that

there was no possession by Udupihilla, and the learned Judge was in error when he held

the contrary.” Thus, it being one of the requirements of traditio which has not been

satisfied, naturally the defendants who claim possession through Udupihilla

could not succeed under the principle of exceptio rei venditae et traditae.

On the other hand, the factual position, as revealed in Rajapakse v

Fernando (supra) appears to be almost identical to that of the instant appeal.

Ennis J, in his judgment stated (at p. 304) “… but it is to be observed that the

document evidencing the original transaction in that case did not purport to convey the

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

27

dominium, the vendor covenanting to obtain the legal title later. In the present case

Carry, in 1909, purported to convey the full dominium and gave possession”.

Therefore, it is my considered view what the Court of Appeal had

expressed on this point is a correct pronouncement both legally and factually,

and it had rightly held that the District Court erred when it opted not to follow

that precedent, an authority which is binding on it, and that too without

providing any reasons for taking a different view. In view of the factors referred

to in the preceding paragraphs, I am in agreement with the impugned conclusion

reached by the Court of Appeal and accordingly proceeds to answer the two

questions of law, which I have reproduced at the commencement of this part of

the judgement, in the negative.

What remains left to be considered at this point is the contention of the

learned President’s Counsel on the applicability of Section 8 of the Land

Development Ordinance. In my view that contention should fail for the reason

that the Privy Council, in the case of Rajapakse v Fernando (supra) stated (at

p.497) that “… the benefit of his subsequent acquisition goes automatically to the earlier

grantee, …” and therefore, with the application of the principle exceptio rei

venditae et traditae, no sooner the Settlement Order is published in the Gazette,

the right, title and interest of the three original owners had over the corpus

enured in favour of the predecessors in title of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. When

the original owners, executed the Deeds of Transfer Nos. 309 and 315 in 1974,

after a period 33 years since the signing of the Deed of Sale No.360 (“P6”), they

had no right, title or interest remaining with them over the corpus which could be

passed over to the Plaintiff with the execution of the Deeds of Transfer Nos. 309

and 315. As a result, these two deeds convey no right, title or interest over the

corpus to the respective vendees. This is because, these two Deeds of Transfer

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

28

were executed in order to transfer the rights that accrued to the original owners

after the publication of the Settlement Order. The reliance placed on the words

“free of all encumbrances” by the Plaintiff would not help him in this instance to

take his case any further than now, since the publication of the Settlement Order

that made the three original owners declared to be entitled to 1/3rd share each

“free of all encumbrances” means that it is free of other encumbrances that are in

conflict with that published statutory entitlement. In this instance, the execution

of the Deed of Sale “P6” is about the transfer of the very entitlement the three

original owners had over the corpus and was not in respect of a right, title or

interest, which is in conflict with the said entitlement, published in the Gazette,

in favour of the three vendors. Therefore, in my humble opinion, in view of the

foregoing, the Deed of Sale No. 360 (“P6”) could not be considered as an

“encumbrance” in terms of Section 8 of the said Ordinance.

In view of these considerations, I regret my inability to accept the

contention presented by the learned President’s Counsel who submitted that,

with the publication of the Settlement Order in the Gazette, the corpus became

“free of all encumbrances” and, as a result, all of its previous titles held by the

original owners, “came to an end”.

In arriving at the above conclusions, I have derived strong support from

comparatively a recent judgment of this Court pronounced in Lalitha Padmini v

Jayatunga (1999) 2 Sri L.R. 163.

This is an instance where one Charles Appu was the original owner of the

land under dispute. He executed a conditional transfer of this land to one Podi

Appuhamy on deed 106 of 14. 10. 57 (P7) in its entirety. The title was re-

transferred to Charles Appu on deed 192 of 15. 05. 61 (P8). In the meantime, by D1,

Charles Appu transferred this land to his daughter Swarna Jayanthi (said to be

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

29

adopted) and son-in-law Elias Appuhamy in 1959. After the said re-transfer,

Charles Appu conveyed the entirety of the land once more to his wife Charlotte on

deed 3806 of 19.07.61 (P3). Charlotte reserving her life interest by P1, donated her

rights to her daughter Lalitha Padmini, the plaintiff in this case. Subsequently by

P6 Charlotte transferred her life interest too to the plaintiff.

Thus, there are two sets of competing title deeds on which the plaintiff and

defendant's wife claimed to have derived title from, as in the instant appeal.

Charles Appu did not have title when he transferred the land to his daughter

Swarna Jayanthi, but soon after he derived title after the re-transfer on deed No.

192 of 15.05.61 (P8) from Podi Appuhamy, who by execution of deed No. 3806 of

19.07.61 (P3) transferred his rights to his wife Charlotte.

The only question presented before Court was whether defendant's deed

of title 9147 of 12.07.59 (D1) being prior in time took precedence over deed No.

3806 of 19.07.61 (P3) by which plaintiff's predecessor Charlotte got title from

Charles.

Ananda Coomaraswamy J, delivering the judgment in the said appeal, was of

the view that (at p. 165); “[A]ccording to Roman Dutch Law principle of exceptio rei

vendita et traditae when Podi Appuhamy transferred by P8 his right, title and interest to

Charles, Charles' interest would have by operation of law devolved on Swarna Jayanthi

presently the wife of Jayatunga. In that instance Charles would have had no interests to

convey to his wife Charlotte and consequently Charlotte the widow could not have

transferred any interests to Lalitha Padmini the plaintiff. Clearly, therefore the plaintiff's

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

30

title does not supersede the title of the wife of the defendant and the plaintiff could not be

said to have established a title superior to that claimed by the defendant's wife. Evidence

on record shows Lalitha Padmini the plaintiff never got possession of this land. In those

circumstances I am unable to conclude that the plaintiff had in any manner proved her

title to the land by deeds nor prescribed to the land.”

Moving on to another aspect in favour of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, it has

already been noted in relation to the instant appeal, that the Deed of Sale “P6”

was registered soon after its execution in 1941, while the Settlement Order and

the two subsequent Deeds of Transfer Nos. 309 and 315 were registered in a

different folio. In Rajapakse v Fernando (supra), Ennis J declared (at p. 305) that

“[O]n first registration ‘the property’ is regarded as registered, and subsequent

instruments dealing with the same property have to show the volume and folio of the

register in which ‘the property’ has been previously registered (Section 24). This scheme

is clearly meant to operate to give notice to subsequent purchasers and others of previous

dealings with the property, be those dealings equitable or otherwise.” His Lordship

therefore concludes that (ibid) “[I]t is to be observed that the property was first

registered in 1909 in folio F 68/253. The subsequent Crown grant and mortgage by

Carry were registered in another folio without reference to F 68/253. In Fernando v.

Pedro Pulle, 2 C. W. R.75, Senaratne v. Peiris 4 C.W.R.65 and Peris v. Perera A.C.R.85,

it was held that the earliest registration of land determines the place for subsequent

registration. The plaintiff's documents have, therefore, not been duly registered.”

In view of this finding, the order of re-trial made by the Court of Appeal

becomes a fruitless exercise, which consume valuable time of the trial Court for

the reason that, if the Plaintiff had no valid title to the corpus, then he is not

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

31

capable of maintaining a partition action in respect of the same. Thus, his action

ought to be dismissed. This is more so, since the only substantive relief sought by

the 2nd and 3rd Defendants too was the dismissal of the Plaintiff’s action.

Therefore, this Court sets aside the segment of the judgment of the Court of

Appeal, by which it ordered that the instant matter be remitted back to the

District Court for consideration of the validity of the claim of acquisition of a

prescriptive title to the corpus by the two Defendants. I am in full agreement with

the rest of the judgment and its conclusion to set aside the judgment of the

District Court, delivered in favour of the Plaintiff.

The answers provided by the District Court to the points of contest Nos. 2

to 5 raised by the Plaintiff should be corrected to read them in the negative and

accordingly the Plaint of the Plaintiff is hereby dismissed.

With the partition action of the Plaintiff being dismissed by this Court, I do

not think that the remaining questions of law requires consideration.

Accordingly, the appeal of the Plaintiff is dismissed.

The 2nd and 3rd Defendants are entitled to the costs of this appeal.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

ARJUNA OBEYESEKERE, J.

I agree.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

32

E.A.G.R. AMARASEKARA, J.

I had the privilege of reading the judgment written by His Lordship Justice

Wengappuli in its draft form. With all due respect to his Lordships views

expressed therein, I prefer to write this separate Judgment. I opine that the learned

District Judge was correct in deciding the title based on deeds as to the pedigree

presented by the Plaintiff. My view with regard to the issue of prescriptive rights

will be discussed later in this Judgment. I also hold that the learned Court of

Appeal Judges erred in applying the Exceptio Rei Vinditae Et Traditea principle to

overturn the findings of the learned District Judge as to the paper title relevant to

the Corpus. I must first confess that due to my impending retirement, I do not

have much time to do a detailed analysis and reasoning of the issues involved, but

I think what is discussed below would be sufficient to explain my conclusion with

regard to the above.

To apply the Exceptio Rei Vinditae Et Traditea principle, it must be shown

that the vendor did not have title or had only a defeasible title at the time he

conveyed his purported title to the vendee. It is true that after the Settlement

Order is published the title of the declared person or the state relates back or

originate from the said Settlement Order with regard to land registered in the new

folio in that regard – vide Section 8 and 9 (2) of the Land Settlement Ordinance.

However, the scheme contemplated by the provisions of the said ordinance does

not indicate that it is meant to give title to the people who does not have title to

their lands. It appears that the scheme contemplated in the said Ordinance is to

decide which lands are private and to transfer them to the respective owners or

their heirs while transferring State lands, including the lands for which there is no

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

33

claim or the claim is not established, to the State. In fact, the Settlement Order in

favour of a person is a result of a claim made by that person to the land so

published in terms of Section 4 of the said Ordinance. This itself show, that if a

Settlement Order is made in favour of a person or persons, his or their claim as to

the title was accepted by the Settlement officer after the inquiry contemplated in

the said Ordinance

The Deed No. 360, marked P6, dated 10.02.1941, which was the deed of

sale executed by the original owners prior to the Settlement Order made, which

Order was made and published in favour of the original owners in 1948 by

Gazette marked P4, mentions that the original owners obtain title to the land in P6

by paternal inheritance and through Crown due to settlement proceedings in

BSPP 712 settlement notice No. 1575. However, there is no provision in the Land

Settlement Ordinance to give or confirm title through a notice or proceedings

without publishing a Settlement Order as per Section 8 of the Ordinance. Be that

as it may, the original owners have stated in the said deed marked P6 that they

inherited title to the undivided portions of 1 acre and 20 perches of the main land

of 10 acres, 2 roods mentioned therein the said deed. One may recite in a deed

that he has title to convey but in fact, without any title, but by obtaining a

Settlement Order in their favour through P4 which happened as per the

Ordinance after an inquiry, it is clear they were able to establish their claim before

the settlement officer to obtain a Settlement Order in their favour for their share

entitlement in the said 10 acre-land. Thus, there is no material to say that the

original owners did not have title to the land mentioned in P6 when they executed

P6 to apply Exceptio Rei Vinditae Et Traditea to the issue at hand in relation to P6

and V3. To apply Exceptio Rei Vinditae Et Traditea to say that vendors of P6 got title

only after the Settlement Order was published, it must be established that the

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

34

vendors did not have title as stated in the said deed marked P6. What the

Settlement Order had done at the matter at hand appears to be the settlement of

title to separate pieces of lands in the said 10-acre land after considering the claims

established in that regard by the claimants and vesting the other pieces of land to

the State where no claims were made or established as per the scheme contained

in the said Ordinance.

As per Section 8 of the Land Settlement Ordinance, once the Settlement

Order is published in the gazette, it shall be judicially noticed and shall be

conclusive proof as to the entitlement of such land, or to such share or interest so

published free of all encumbrances whatsoever other than those specified in the

Settlement Order. Further such share or interest or land vests absolutely in the

State or in such person, as the case may be, to the exclusion of unspecified interest

of whatsoever nature. It must be noted that such conclusiveness does not depend

on the registration but comes into existence with the publication of the Settlement

Order. It must also be noted that as per Section 9(2) of the Ordinance, particulars

of every such settlement have to be entered in a new folio allotted to such land so

settled. Any instrument, that is executed after that entry, affecting that land so

settled has to be registered in the said new folio or in a continuation of the said

new folio for it to be considered as duly registered. These provisions indicate after

the settlement, the piece of land so settled gets a new identity independent of any

bigger land that existed prior to the settlement, and any instrument registered not

in the said new folio or in continuation of it, but in any other folio, including the

folio where the previously existed bigger land registered, cannot be considered as

registered in the proper folio for the purposes of due registration for issues

relating to prior registration. Thus, the new folio which register the settlement

details or its continuation becomes the correct folio for the relevant land so settled

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

35

against any other folio including the folio where any bigger land that existed prior

to the settlement, out of which the settled portion of land was carved out,

registered. However, no such folio where the bigger land of 10 acre was registered

and its continuations have been marked through evidence to show that the deeds

that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants rely on have been properly registered at all. No

folio has been tendered in evidence where P6 was registered and the copy of P6

tendered in evidence and available in Judge’s brief does not indicate any

endorsement made by the land registry to indicate that it was ever registered.

However, V3, deed No.847 executed based on the purported title obtained

through P6 bears its prior registration and an endorsement by the land registry.

Anyhow, there is nothing to show that it was registered in the folio where the

settlement order was registered or in continuation of such folio. Hence, there was

nothing to show that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ deeds get priority over the title to

lands shown in the Plaintiff’s pedigree. Thus, I doubt whether there was sufficient

material for the learned Court of Appeal Judges to distinguish this case at hand

from the decided case mentioned therein in their Judgement based on the

registration of Defendant’s deeds. However, in my view, registration in the proper

folio on a prior date only gives the priority. The Exceptio Rei Vinditae Et Traditea

has nothing to with the registration. First, it must be established that the vendor

did not have title at the time of the transaction and, thereafter, it must be shown

that the vendor obtained title to the subject matter afterwards. If these are proved

then the said principle applies and it is only then that it can be examined whether

priority of registration is relevant. In the matter at hand, as discussed above, there

is no sufficient material to state that the original owner did not have title when

they executed P6. In fact, the Settlement Order confirms they had a claim to title

and it was considered and accepted and a portion without encumbrances with

absolute title was given to them after the inquiry relating to the settlement of the

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

36

main land. As explained above, for the land so settled, there cannot be any other

due folio other than the one where the Settlement Order was entered and its

continuations. It must also be noted that as per P6 the original owners appear to

have title to an undivided share in the bigger land but with the settlement, it has

become a co-ownership only for the land so settled.

In their submissions, 2nd and 3rd Defendants try to say that the notice of

settlement referred to in P6 is the one related to Settlement Order, X4, but the said

notice or the gazette containing it has not been tendered in evidence to take

judicial notice of it. Even if it is taken as true, not making a claim based on P6 for

their entitlement at the settlement inquiry make that entitlement to be vested in

the State through the Settlement Order – vide Section 4(1) and 5(1) of the

Ordinance. On the other hand, I doubt whether there is sufficient material to say

whether it is the same entitlement of land conveyed by P6 to the Predecessor of

the 2nd and 3rd Defendants that was claimed by the original owners in the

settlement inquiry. What was conveyed through P6 in an undivided portion of 1

acre and 20 perches but one cannot say without sufficient evidence that the

original owners did not have any other undivided share after executing P6. On the

other hand, even if it is the same entitlement referred to in P6, that was claimed by

the original owners in the settlement inquiry by engaging in a fraudulent act by

not revealing the entitlement of the vendees in P6, there is a solution provided by

law in proviso to Section 8of the Land Settlement Ordinance. The affected person

can claim the land or damages. No evidence of any action filed by the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants or their predecessors based on such a cause of action is available.

Where law provides a remedy, one must find relief through that remedy first. Nor

the 2nd and 3rd Defendants have raised any issue based on that provision during

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

37

the trial to consider remedial measures if any fraud or suppression of facts

occurred during the settlement inquiry.

As per the reasons mentioned above, it is my view, that the learned

District Judge was correct in refusing the chain of title of the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants and the learned Court of Appeal Judges erred in deciding against the

judgment of the learned District Judge as to the paper title of the Parties.

The issue of prescription has to be decided on facts. The learned District

Judge appears to have refused to accept the position of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants

on the basis that the Plaintiff, at one occasion had stated the Brumpi Singho, a

predecessor of the Defendant, gave money to one of the original owners, Robert

Bandara, which was not challenged in evidence. At pages 99 and 100 of the brief,

the Plaintiff had said during cross examination that Brumpi Singho gave money

for tapping rubber but has not revealed how he came to know that fact. As it

appears to be a transaction between Brumpi Singho and one of the Original

Owner, if it is true, one of them should have told him, thus it may be hearsay. On

the other hand, at page 100, the Plaintiff has stated he does not know who tapped

the rubber trees. Thus, it is questionable why Brumpi Singho gave money to

Robert Bandara, one of the original owners. Even money can be paid owing to any

investment agreement between Brumpi Singho and Robert Bandara, for example

to grow rubber on the land belong to Brumpi Singho. In my view, said evidence is

not sufficient to establish any landlord and licensee relationship. Even though it

has not been mentioned in the Judgement of the learned District Judge, it appears

that the Plaintiff had stated that he enjoyed fruits of two jack trees. In a village, it

is natural for neighbours to enjoy fruits of a jack tree owned by some others. The

Plaintiff had not claimed any trees before the surveyor. That too is not sufficient to

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

38

contrast with the long possession proved by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants even by

calling witnesses from Rubber Control Department and many others to prove

their possession on the basis of their purported ownership based on said P6 and

V3, deed No.847, even though those deeds are of no avail due to Settlement Order.

On the other hand, there are sufficient evidence to say that the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants are in possession without allowing the Plaintiff to have control over

the Property. There had been previous application before the High Court in that

regard. It is apparent that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants and their predecessors have

been in the possession of the land identified through the preliminary survey on

the basis of a purported ownership based on the said P6 and V3, from the time of

the execution of Deed P6 in 1941 as there is no other way to explain their presence

in the land. As said before, these deeds are of no value due to the Settlement

Order. No doubt, the possession based on those deeds, though of no value, is

adverse to the paper title claiming through the Settlement Order along with the

subsequent deeds as well as inheritance for the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant by

the Plaintiff. Thus, the Court of Appeal erred in deciding to send the case for

retrial to decide on prescription. The Court of Appeal could have decided in

favour of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants based on their prescriptive title. Thus, in my

view, even though the learned District Judge was correct with regard to the paper

title, the learned District Judge erred in deciding against the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants by refusing their prescriptive title. The learned Court of Appeal

Judges erred in applying Exceptio Rei Vinditae Et Traditea principle to overturn the

learned District Judge’s decision as to the paper title and also erred in deciding on

prescription when there was sufficient evidence to establish that prescriptive title

in favour of the 2nd and 3rd Defendant. Thus, the Questions of Law (i) and (ii) are

answered in the affirmative in favour of the Appellants.

S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012

39

In a partition action, land has to be identified through a preliminary

survey. It has been done in the matter at hand. The prescriptive claim of the

Defendant is made to the said undisputed corpus of the action, and prescription is

based on the possession of that identified land. Merely because the deeds relied by

the 2nd and 3rd Defendants refer to an undivided portion of a larger land which

now does not exists as such after the Settlement Order, that larger land need not

be superimposed as far as they can prove adverse possession to the land identified

through the preliminary survey. Thus, the question of law (iii) is answered in the

negative as there was no need of such superimposition.

The question of law (iv) is connected to the question of law (iii) above. It is

argued on behalf of the Appellant (Plaintiff) that the Respondents (2nd & 3rd

Defendants) claim was for the prescription of a portion of a bigger land and they

failed to prove that the assistance they received from the Rubber Control

Department was for the land shown in the Preliminary Plan. As said before, as per

the evidence, it is clear that even though their purported entitlement by paper title

was for a part of a bigger land, they are in possession in the identified land based

on that claim. However, the Court of Appeal had not made a decision on

prescriptive title. Therefore, this question of law does not arise.

With regard to question of law (v), the Plaintiff – Appellant had made

submissions relating to the proof of V3. It does not arise as, it is not V3 that gives

title to them but prescription.

Thus, I allow the appeal with regard to the directions sought to set aside

the Judgment of Court of Appeal and the Judgment of District Court but refuse to

grant relief as prayed in the Plaint as the Plaint should be dismissed on the basis

of prescriptive title of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants as established by the evidence

led at the trial.

Appeal is partly allowed. No costs.
