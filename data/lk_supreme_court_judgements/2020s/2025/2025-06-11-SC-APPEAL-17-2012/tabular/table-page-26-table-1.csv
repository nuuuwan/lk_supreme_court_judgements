"S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012"
"This  factor  indeed  satisfies  both  the  requirements,  as  identified  by  the"
"Privy  Council  in  the  said  judgment.  These  two  requirements,  as  set  out  in  that"
"judgment (at p. 391), are stated as follows, “[S]till the exceptio given by the Roman"
"law required the double conditions, not only that the property should be sold, but that it"
"should  be  delivered, though  the  delivery  might  in the  case  mentioned  be  presumed  by  a"
"fiction; …”. The evidence before the trial Court, not only satisfies the requirement"
"of  traditio  but  in  addition,  also  makes  an  important  distinction  with  the  factual"
"position considered in Periacaruppan Chettiar v Messrs Proprietors and Agents"
"Ltd  (supra).  Howard  CJ,  himself  distinguishes  the  matter  before  their  Lordship"
"with the factual situation of Gunatilleke v Fernando (21 NLR 495 and Rajapakse"
"v Fernando supra, at p. 130) by stating that “… I do not think the principles laid down"
"in  Gunatilleke  v  Fernando  and  Rajapakse  v  Fernando  apply”,  as  these  are  the"
"instances  where  the  principle  of  exceptio  rei  venditae  et  traditae  was  applied"
"successfully to the party that pleaded its benefit."
