"were executed in order to transfer the rights that accrued to the original owners"
"after  the  publication  of  the  Settlement  Order.  The  reliance  placed  on  the  words"

"take his case any further than now, since the publication of the Settlement Order"

"“free  of  all  encumbrances”  means  that it is  free  of  other  encumbrances  that are  in"
"conflict with that published statutory entitlement. In this instance, the execution"
"of  the  Deed  of  Sale  “P6”  is  about  the  transfer  of  the  very  entitlement  the  three"
"original  owners  had  over  the  corpus  and  was  not  in  respect  of  a  right,  title  or"
"interest, which is in conflict with the said entitlement, published in the Gazette,"
"in favour of the three vendors. Therefore, in my humble opinion, in view of the"
"foregoing,  the  Deed  of  Sale  No.  360  (“P6”)  could  not  be  considered  as  an"
"“encumbrance” in terms of Section 8 of the said Ordinance."
