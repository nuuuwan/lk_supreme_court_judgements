"S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012"
"land were wiped out by the settlement order, including any rights which Udupihilla may"
"have had upon his purchase from Ausadanide.”"
"In relation to the application of the principle; exceptio rei venditae et traditae,"
"learned President’s Counsel contended that since any encumbrance on the corpus"
"gets wiped out by the publication of the Settlement Order, the provisions of Land"
"Settlement Ordinance made the said principle inapplicable to the instant matter"
"and thus the deeds that were executed in favour of the Plaintiff remain valid in"
"law and convey the title it transferred in favour of the transferee."
"Learned Counsel for the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, in seeking to counter the"
"contention  of  the  Plaintiff,  submitted  to  this  Court  that  a  vendor  who  sells  his"
"property without title but acquires the same, the said title subsequently acquired"
"would accrue to the benefit of the purchaser and those claiming through him. He"
"cited  a 
long 
list  of  precedents  which  acted  on 
that  principle.  He 
further"
"contended  that  the  facts  and  reasoning  adopted  in  Periacaruppen  Chettiar  v"
"Messrs  Proprietors  and  Agents  Ltd.(1946)  47NLR  121,  are  not  applicable  to  the"
"determination of the instant appeal as it was held that the said principle was not"
"available  in  that  instance  due  to  the  reason  that  the  relevant  deeds  were  not"
"registered. Similarly, learned Counsel contended that the decision of Karunadasa"
"v  Abdul  Hameed  (supra)  too 
is  not  applicable 
to  the 
instant  appeal  as 
the"
"purchaser  in  that  instance,  one  Udupihilla,  was  not  placed  in  possession  of  the"
"land  and  the  relevant  section  of  that  judgment  relied  on  by  the  Plaintiff  was"
"made  by  Court  either  erroneously  or  due  to  an  oversight,  as  the  judgment  of"
"Periacaruppen Chettiar v Messrs Proprietors and Agents Ltd (ibid) made no such"
"pronouncement declaring that the said principle is not available to purchaser as"
"against a vendor who obtained title under the Settlement Order."
