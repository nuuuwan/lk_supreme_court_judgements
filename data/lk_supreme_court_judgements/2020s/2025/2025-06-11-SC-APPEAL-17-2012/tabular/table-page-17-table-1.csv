"S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012"
"title  has  by  fraudulent  contrivance  been  concealed  from  the  Court.  The  effect  of  such  a"
"decree is to determine all pre-existing right or title and every claim to any right or title to"
"the subject of partition.” His Lordship further added that (at p. 413),” [I] am aware"
"of no case in which it has been held that the exceptio rei venditae et traditae is available to"
"a purchaser who is seeking to resist his vendor or a person claiming through him upon a"
"title declared by the final decree in a partition action. Nor has counsel been able to refer"
"me to any authority for the proposition. The matter is res integra.”"
