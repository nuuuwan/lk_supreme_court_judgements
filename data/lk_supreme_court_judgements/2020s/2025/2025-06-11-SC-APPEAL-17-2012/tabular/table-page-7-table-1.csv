"S.C. Appeal No. 17/2012"
"The District Court, in answering the Point of Contest No. 7 in the negative,"
"did  not  accept  the  submissions  of  the  2nd  to  3rd  Defendants,  who  relied  on  the"
"application of the principle in Roman Dutch Law known as exceptio rei vinditae et"
"traditae, 
in  support  of  their  claim  for  title.  The  original  Court  rejected  that"
"submission,  primarily  on 
the  basis 
that 
the  said  principle  of 
law  had  no"
"application against a recipient who received title in terms of a Settlement Order"
"issued under the Land Settlement Ordinance, following the dicta of the judgment"
"of Karunadasa v Abdul Hameed  (1958) 60 NLR  352,  and  therefore held  that the"
"title  of  the 
land  did  not  devolve  on  their  predecessors 
in  title,  despite  the"
"execution  of  the  Deed  of  Sale  No.  360  (“P6”).  The  Court  further  stated  that,  in"
"arriving  at  the  said  conclusion,  it  also  considered  the  fact  that  the  relevant"
"Gazette  notification 
containing 
the  Settlement  Order  had  been 
issued  on"
"16.01.1948  and, 
in 
terms  of  Section  8  of 
the  said  Ordinance,  all  previous"
"encumbrances  over 
that  particular  parcel  of 
land  deemed 
is 
to  have  been"
"extinguished. Therefore, the Court proceeded on the basis that when the two of"
"the three original owners have transferred their respective shares over the corpus"
"in favour of the Plaintiff by executing the Deeds of Transfer No. 309 and 315 in"
"his favour, he is entitled to the 2/3rd shares claimed and held by them."
