SC/APPEAL/46/2025

Samayawardhena, J.

This appeal arises in unusual circumstances.

The employee-appellant filed an application before the Labour Tribunal

alleging that his services were unjustifiably terminated by the employer-

respondent. The Labour Tribunal by order dated 02.05.2023 held in favour

of the appellant and ordered the respondent to pay a sum of Rs. 1,844,000

as compensation.

In terms of section 31D of the Industrial Disputes Act, if an employer

decides to appeal against such order, he is required to deposit the said

amount in the Labour Tribunal as a precondition to the filing of an appeal.

Being dissatisfied with the said order, the respondent deposited the sum of

Rs. 1,844,000 on 06.06.2023 and filed the petition of appeal in the High

Court on 07.06.2023. Both acts were done well within the prescribed time.

However, the deposit was made not in the Labour Tribunal, as mandated

by the Act, but in the relevant Labour Office. The respondent pleads that

this occurred due to a bona fide mistake and that he had no intention

whatsoever to disregard the law. The Labour Office confirms that the

respondent deposited the said amount on 06.06.2023. I am satisfied that

this was a bona fide mistake on the part of the respondent.

The appellant raised a preliminary objection before the High Court

challenging the maintainability of the appeal on the basis that the security

ought to have been deposited in the Labour Tribunal and not in the Labour

Office. The High Court overruled this objection. Hence this appeal.

The Latin legal maxim summum ius, summa iniuria cautions, in certain

circumstances, the strictest application of the law may itself result in

injustice. However, this observation should not be regarded as a licence to

intentionally flout the law or to defeat its mandatory requirements. The case

3

SC/APPEAL/46/2025

at hand is a unique case in which the respondent has substantially

complied with the statutory requirement, and the deviation has occurred

solely due to a bona fide mistake, without any intention to circumvent the

law.

There is no need to engage in an academic exercise by answering the

questions of law. I am of the view that the ends of justice will be met by

permitting the High Court to determine the appeal on the merits.

The appeal is dismissed without costs.

The High Court is directed to conclude the appeal as expeditiously as

possible.
