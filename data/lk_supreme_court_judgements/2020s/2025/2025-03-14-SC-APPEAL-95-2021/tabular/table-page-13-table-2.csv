"P11 and P12 are dated 22.04.1967. This action was filed in 1980.  The"
"Court of Appeal states:"
"However,  as  I  observed  earlier,  the  1st  defendant  has  signed  and"
"accepted the ownership and/or title of the 2nd defendant by P11 and"
"P12. Therefore, if the 1st defendant prescribed to the disputed land,"
"he should have done it after the signing of these documents in 1967."
"(….) However, the evidence of the 1(a) substituted defendant doesn’t"
"reveal any overt act by which her predecessor (i.e. the 1st defendant)"
"started holding the disputed land adversely to his principal (i.e. the"
"2nd defendant) after 1967."
