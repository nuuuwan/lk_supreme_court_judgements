"On the face of the plaintiffs’ deed marked P4, the plaintiffs had not done"
"a  search  at  the  Land  Registry  prior  to  the  purchase  of  the  land  as  the"
"notary has made an endorsement on the deed “search dispensed with”."
"Had  the  plaintiffs  done  a  search  in  the  Land  Registry  prior  to  the"
"purchase of the land, they would have easily realised that there is another"
"party claiming ownership to the land."
"In  the  face  of  overwhelming  evidence  in  favour  of  the  1st  defendant  on"
"long possession, what led the Court of Appeal to hold against him? The"
"Court of Appeal considered P11 and P12 as decisive documents. Had it"
"not been for the interpretation given to P11 and P12, the Court of Appeal"
"would have arrived at a different conclusion."
"P11  and  P12  are  assumed 
to  have  been  marked  during  cross-"

"recorded evidence, there is no reference to P11. (vide pages 178-179 of"
"the appeal brief) In my view, the 1(a) defendant had been forced to admit"
"the signature on those documents or one of them as that of her father."
"However, she explicitly stated that she was unaware of these documents,"
"which were shown to her for the first time during cross-examination."
"Let  me  briefly  digress 
to  emphasise  another 
important  aspect 
in"
"conducting trials. Just before these documents were shown to her, it was"
"repeatedly  suggested 
that  her  deceased 
father,  Subanaris,  was  an"
"illegitimate  child  born  to  a  domestic  servant  named  Nonchihamy.  She"
"repeatedly  stated  that  she  was  unaware  of  her  grandparents’  conduct."
"That, however, was irrelevant to the issue before the District Judge. In"
