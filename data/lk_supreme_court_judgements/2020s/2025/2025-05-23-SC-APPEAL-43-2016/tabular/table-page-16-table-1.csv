"S.C. Appeal 43/2016"
"the said case. Prescription has to be proved in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription"
"Ordinance and a servitude must be proved according to the law regarding servitudes."
"Those will be considered below in this judgment. However, merely there was a case"
"filed for damages (as per the issues raised in that action) over an attempt to construct"
"road and withdrawal of it cannot itself say that the Defendants of this case used the road"
"way thereafter. On the other hand, if there was such a regular use of the purported right"
"of way, it is not probable that the Plaintiffs would wait till 1983 to file another action."
"Such use must be proved by leading necessary evidence. It is also stated in evidence by"
"the witness Ariyarathne called by the Plaintiffs that there exists a part of the house (a"
"hood), where the Defendants claim the roadway, which has to be demolished to give a"
"roadway. He also had spoken about the attempt by the Defendants to make the road"
"which made the Plaintiff to make the police complaint. As per the Defendantsâ€™ witness"
"said part of the house (hood) was not there and later on, came in to existence. However,"
"if this roadway was used regularly, it is difficult to think the said structure would come"
"in to existence without objection and litigation in that regard. The evidence indicates"
"attempts to use the roadway as well as occasions of putting up obstacles to such use and"
"litigations or going to police on such occasions."
