"S.C. Appeal 43/2016"
"on behalf of the Defendants as signs of a roadway may be found on a land even when"
"the  owners  himself  use  it  for  such  purpose  or  may  have  given  permission  for  some"
"others to use it as an access. As said before, a right of way has to be proved by the"
"person who claim it. However, this is evidence for that the surveyor who did the said"
"survey  for  the  preliminary  plan  observed  a  track  of  a  roadway  across  the  land  he"
"surveyed during the preliminary survey for the said partition action. However, it must"
"be said that to claim a servitude along the part of Lot F that runs over Lot E in this plan"
"successfully, the Defendants must prove that the servitude that they claim exists over"
"Lot  B  and  A  of  this  Plan  and  any  other  intervening  lands,  if  any,  as  their  lands  are"
"situated beyond Lot A. As said before, no other servient tenement had been included in"
"their Answer nor has they shown the entire servitude that commences from their lands"
"(dominant tenements) till the Ragama Kadawatha Road either through a plan or sketch."
"3.  A  settlement  entered  between  the  Plaintiffs  in  this  case  and  one  Seelawathie  who"
"appears to be the sister of the 2nd Plaintiff of this case in District Court Gampaha Case"
"No. 21255/L, marked V4: -"
"Through this settlement, it was decreed that the portion of land south to the said road"
"depicted in Lot A of aforesaid V2 which was excluded from the final partition in the"
"aforesaid partition action to be given to Seelawathie and the portion of land North to"
"the said road to be given to the Plaintiffs. However, the Plaintiffs’ position is that this"
"road  (Lot  F)  in  V2  is  for  their  use  including  the  said  sister  of  the  2nd  Plaintiff,"
"Seelawathie and not for others. It appears that a part of the Seelawathie’s portion is now"
"occupied by one Ahamed. However, said V4 decree is also of evidence of a road but"
"merely the existence of a road does not give Defendants a right of way by Prescription"
"or as a way of necessity as it can be for a private access. The burden is on the Defendants"
