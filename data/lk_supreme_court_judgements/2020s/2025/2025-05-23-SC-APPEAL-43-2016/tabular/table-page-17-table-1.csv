"S.C. Appeal 43/2016"
"1.  The position of the Defendants is that they have a right of way by prescription or as a"
"way  of  necessity  which  falls  within  the  category  of  praedial  or  real  servitude  which"
"belongs to a person as an owner of a certain house or land (in the matter in hand on the"
"basis of their purported ownership to the lands described in schedule to the Answer or"
"to the lots in plan marked V1). Thus, when a right of way is established, it has to be"
"established in relation to an ownership of a dominant land over the servient land."
"While the praedial servitude is an encumbrance over the servient land, the benefit to"
"and the burden of a praedial servitude are inseparable from the land to which they are"
"attached; They pass with the land to every succeeding owner. The right to the servitude"
"cannot be separated even temporarily from the right to the land.3"
"At the re-trial, four witnesses had given evidence on behalf of the Defendants. They are"
"Dayasoma  Siriwardane  (Gramaseva  Niladari),  A.M.  Piyatissa,  K.A.D  Philip  and"
"Mallika Coorey (Substituted 2nd Defendant). Thus, only the substituted 2nd Defendant"
"was  the  only  party  Defendant  who  gave  evidence  for  the  Defendants.  The  aforesaid"

"dominant lands stated in the schedule to the Answer. It must be noted that no admissions"
"had  been  recorded  as  to  the  ownership  of  purported  dominant  lands.  Although  the"
"witness A. M. Piyatissa had also stated that certain lots in plan marked V1 belonged to"
"certain Defendants but without marking the relevant deeds. As he is not a Defendant"
"himself, if he says that certain lots in V1 belongs to certain Defendants it must be due"
"to the fact that he came to know that fact from some other source which is not produced"
"before Court, thus hearsay. Even the Mallika Cooreyâ€™s evidence as to the ownership of"
"other Defendants has to be considered as hearsay on the same footing. Her evidence as"
"to  the  Lot  that  belonged  to  her  father,  the  original  2nd  Defendant  was  too  without"
"marking the relevant deed in evidence, and one cannot be allowed to speak to the facts,"
"and lead secondary evidence to prove a fact that contain in a deed unless it is shown"
"that circumstances fall within the ambit of section 65 of the Evidence Ordinance - vide"
"Sections 91 and 65 of the Evidence Ordinance. The position of the Answer and the issue"
