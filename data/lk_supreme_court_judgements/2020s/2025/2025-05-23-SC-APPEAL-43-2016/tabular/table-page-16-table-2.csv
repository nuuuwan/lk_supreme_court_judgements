"attempts to use the roadway as well as occasions of putting up obstacles to such use and"
"litigations or going to police on such occasions."
"As said before, mere showing of a track of a road through plans does not establish a right"
"of way as it may be an access used by the owners itself or by some with the permission of"
"the owners or a right of way limited to some other persons for their dominant tenements"
"etc. It is also stated above in this judgment that the burden of proving the existence of a"
"right of way is on the person who claim the existence of such right of way. As per what is"
"discussed above, it is this Court’s view that there was a track that can be identified as an"
"access road as shown by the plans even from the time of said partition case. Whether the"
"Defendants have a right of way over the land of the Plaintiffs to use that track of road has"
"to be proved by the Defendants. Even though this Court observes that the plans marked in"
"this  action  show  a  track  of  a  road  that  commences  from  the  Kadawatha  Ragama  road"
"running  across  the  land  shown  in  Plan  marked  V2  (preliminary  plan  of  the  aforesaid"
"partition action)  including Lot E which is the Plaintiffs’ land in the schedule to the plaint,"
"for  the  reasons  mentioned  below,  this  Court  has  to  decide  that  the  Defendants  failed  to"
"prove a right  of way to use that track as a right of way by prescription or as a way of"
"necessity."
