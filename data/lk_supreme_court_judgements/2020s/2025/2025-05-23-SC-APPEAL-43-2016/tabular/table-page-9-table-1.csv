"S.C. Appeal 43/2016"
"release  each  Defendant  from  establishing  how  each  of  them  acquired  a  right  of  way  by"
"prescription or how a way of necessity has arisen to each of them and to what extent. (For e.g."
"Whether the need is for a footpath or a cart road etc.)."
"The Plaintiffs’ action can be identified as an actio negatoria while Defendants’ position, even"
"though they had not prayed for a declaration of it, is based on a claim of a right of way making"
"it similar to actio confessoria.  In Roman Dutch Law actio negatoria permits an owner to deny"
"the existence of an alleged servitude or other rights entitling the Defendant to cause physical"
"disturbance to his land. Thus, what the Plaintiffs have to prove is the ownership and existence"
"of an identifiable property and the conduct of the Defendants that infringes his rights, either"
"because it amounts to an excessive exercise of an acknowledged limited real right or because"
"the Defendant is exercising a non-existing limited real right."
"The Plaintiffs, at the re-trial before the learned District Judge (there had been a previous trial"
"where  re-trial  was  ordered  in  Appeal)  had  marked  their  title  deeds  as  P5  and  P6  and  it  is"
"common ground that the Plaintiffs are the owners of the land in the schedule to the Plaint. On"
"the other hand, Defendants impliedly had accepted the title of the Plaintiffs to the land as they"
"claim a servitudinal right of way as such right is one that is claimed over the servient tenement"
"belongs to the owner of that servient land.  Further the 2nd Plaintiff have stated in evidence"
"regarding an attempt to construct a road way across their land, the police complaints made, the"
"magistrate Court case instituted by the Police and thereafter filing of this civil action to resolve"
"the  matter.  Even  the  Grama  Niladari  who  gave  evidence  on  behalf  of  the  Defendants  have"
"stated about complaints received regarding the dispute over the alleged obstructions caused by"
"the Plaintiffs. Even though the Defendants deny that they attempted to construct a roadway, it"
"is clear that they rely on an existence of a right of way.  It appears that there were occasions"
"that where the Defendant attempted to clear and use the road way and the Plaintiffs obstructed"
"the using of the road way. Thus, in my view there were sufficient grounds for the Plaintiffs to"
"institute an action in the nature of actio negatoria as the Defendants claim a right of way over"
"their land."
"The learned High Court Judges in their Judgment dated 26.03.2010 have stated as below;"
"“The learned District Judge identified the Plaintiff’s land as the Lot E in preliminary plan V2"
"and the learned Counsel for the defendants argued that the defendant(sic) had not prayed for"
