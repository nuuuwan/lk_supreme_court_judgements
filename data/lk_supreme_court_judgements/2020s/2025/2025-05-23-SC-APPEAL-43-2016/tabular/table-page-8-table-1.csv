"S.C. Appeal 43/2016"
"averred  that  they  have  a  right  of  way  over  the  Plaintiffs’  land,  they  have  not  prayed  for  a"
"servitude of right of way in their Answer and prayed mainly for the dismissal of the Plaint and"
"costs of the action. It is clear, as per the averments in the Answer, what is stated in defense by"
"the Defendants is the existence of a servitudinal right of way over the Plaintiffs ‘property by"
"prescription or in the alternative by way of necessity. Neither in the answer nor through issues"
"raised at the trial, it had been contended that the purported roadway is a public road that belongs"
"to the local authority or a public servitude that came into existence by Vetustas, in other words"
"by immemorial user which is different from acquisitive prescription.  It must be also noted that,"
"even though the position of the Defendants’ prayer for the dismissal of the plaint is based on"
"their purported entitlement to a servitude of a right of way as aforesaid, no servient tenement"
"or servient tenements, if the servitude exists over many lands, is/are described in their Answer."
"Anyway, as the Plaintiff has described his land in his Plaint and the Answer was filed in reply"
"to the said Plaint, one may be able to identify the land described in the Plaint as a servient"
"tenement,  but  it  appears  that  it  is  not  the  only  servient  tenement  over  which  the  alleged"
"servitude exists. Other servient lands had not been revealed in the Answer, nor had there been"
"any request for bring the owners of those servient tenements to be made parties to the action."
"In Fernando v Dona Maria 32 N L R 166, it was held that, to establish a right of way over"
"one  servient  tenement,  when  there  are  intervening  properties,  it  is  necessary  to  prove  the"
"existence  of  the  servitude  over  the  said  intervening  properties  and  for  that  purpose  it  is"
"necessary to bring the owners of those properties as parties to the action. However, in De Silva"
"v Nonohamy 34 N L R 113, the majority was of the view that it is not necessary to bring the"
"owners of the other servient tenements as parties. Anyhow, it appears, that the need to prove"
"the existence of the servitude over the other servient tenements over which the right of way"
"passes over is necessary due to the indivisibility of praedial servitudes."
"It has to be assumed that each separate lot allegedly owned by each Defendant is the dominant"
"tenement for the purpose of each of the Defendant’s claim that there is a right of way over the"
"property. It must be noted that in Fernando V De Silva 30 N L R 56, where the plaintiffs who"
"owned distinct allotments of lands sued the defendant claiming a cartway of necessity over the"
"defendant’s land, it was held that the action was bad for misjoinder of parties and causes action."
"In  the  matter  at  hand,  the  Defendants  have  listed  their  separate  lots  in  the  schedules  to  the"
"Answer.  How  each  of  them  has  a  right  of  way  by  prescription  or  how  and  to  what  extent"
"necessity arises depends on the facts relating to each Defendant. As no objection has been taken"
"for misjoinder before the trial commences, it should not be considered now, but this will not"
