"is the last piece of land on the said purported right of way as there cannot be a right of"
"way without a right of way over those lands."
"6.  Proceedings dated 25.03.73 of the case No.16262/L Gampaha District Court marked as"

"This document shows that there had been another case between the 2nd Plaintiff and the"
"1st Defendant and some others regarding a land named Millagahawatta Idam Kebella"
"(Portion of Millagahawatta).  The 2nd Plaintiff was the plaintiff in that matter and it"
"appears that there were five defendants and the 1st Defendant of this case was the 1st"
"Defendant  in  that  matter  too.  As  per  evidence,  it  appears  it  was  regarding  the  same"
"roadway. As per the issues raised in that case, the Plaintiff in that matter had alleged a"
"construction of roadway of 12 feet by force and unlawfully by the Defendants in that"
"case, and the Defendants in that case had taken up the position that it was road used by"
"villagers to go to the village. Thus, the first Defendant’s and others claim in that case"
"was not based on prescription or necessity but rather as a road used by the public to go"
"to the village for a long period. Thus, it appears that the position taken in that case was"
"rather based on vestustas or it was via vicinalis, a road existed from time immemorial"
"via usage by members of the public. This is different from a person claiming a right of"
"way by prescription by adverse user for ten years or more. However, it should be noted"
"in the present case, the Defendants including the 1st Defendant who was a party to the"
"case No.16262/L, for some reason had not taken such a position through their Answer"

"to it by parties – vide Pathmawathie v Jayasekara (1997) 1 Sri L R 248. The aforesaid"
"case  No.  16262/L  had  been  withdrawn  reserving  the  right  to  file  a  new  case  by  the"
"Plaintiff in that case who is the 2nd Plaintiff in this case. The learned High Court Judges"
"in their Judgment have taken the view that the Defendants were using the said road"
"from that time and therefore entitled to the roadway as the 2nd issue in that case was"
"whether  the  Defendants  in  that  case  constructed  a  road  and  used  it  in  the  month  of"
"March in 1970. Further, the learned High Court Judges have observed that the witness"
"of the Plaintiff at one occasion has admitted that the Defendants use this road. But the"
"learned District Court Judge had taken the view that there is no sufficient evidence to"
"hold that the said road was used continuously by the Defendant after the withdrawal of"
