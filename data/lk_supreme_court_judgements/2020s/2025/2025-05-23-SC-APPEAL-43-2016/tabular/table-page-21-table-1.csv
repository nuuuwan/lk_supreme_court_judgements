"S.C. Appeal 43/2016"
"Plaintiff in this case obstructed the road way. This witness Piyatissa had bought the"
"land in 1976. He too has stated that he saw the Defendants using this road. He has also"
"spoken of an obstruction caused by the Plaintiff. As this case was filed in 1983, the"
"witnesses mentioned above does not place sufficient material to prove uninterrupted"
"user for 10 years of the road way. K.A.D Philip who gave evidence for the Defendants"
"had stated that it was his father who sold the land to the father of the 2nd Plaintiff in or"
"around 1940 and it seems that he was about 10 years old at that time. He had spoken"
"about using this road to come home during school days. If it was his father’s land at"
"that time, it is not definite evidence to show it was a road for others too. His evidence"
"does not establish sufficient facts to hold that the Defendants had acquired right of way"
"by prescription over what the Defendants’ now claim as a right of way. On the other"
"hand, the use of this witness of a road access in his father’s land as far back as 1940 or"
"later to visit someone very infrequently, as stated in his evidence, is not a user that the"
"Defendants can tag on to in terms of Section 3 of the Prescription ordinance as they did"
"not obtained title from him. It appears that it is the position of the Defendants that all"
"the Defendants obtained title as per an auction plan found on the auction notice marked"
"P15. Even if it is not so, it is clear they claim that they are the owners of various lots in"
"plan marked V1 and it is their own averment in the Answer which says that they became"
"owners  to  their  lots  by  deeds  referred  to  in  the  answer.  In  fact,  as  the  deeds  of  the"
"Defendants had not been produced, it is difficult find whose adverse user can be tagged"
"on to by the Defendants as there is nothing to prove who the predecessors in title to the"
"dominant land or lands were. On the other hand, if their right of way was given through"
"another access road by those deeds, it may affect their claim for a way of necessity."
"Thus,  not  presenting  the  title  deeds  to  their  lots  (to  purported  dominant  lands)  in"
"evidence by the Defendants affect their claim in two ways, firstly, there is no proof to"
"say that they are the owners of the dominant lands which is the base of their claim, and"
"they cannot tag on to the user of the predecessor in title without proving who he/she is."
"On the other hand, producing it may affect their claims in this case if there is anything"
"contrary to their claim included in the deed."
"The last witness for the Defendants was the substituted 2nd Defendant, Mallika Coorey."
"She in her evidence-in-chief, while admitting that she occupies the Lot 12 in V1 which"
"was  the  property  of  the  original  2nd  Defendant,  has  attempted  to  say  that  the  other"
"Defendants bought their lots from her father, the original 2nd Defendant. This may be"
"an attempt to tag her father’s alleged user of the purported road way to the benefit of"
