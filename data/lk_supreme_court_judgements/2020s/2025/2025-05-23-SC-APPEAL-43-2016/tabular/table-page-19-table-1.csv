"“
The principle pertaining to the indivisibility of servitudes has been given expression"
"in another context."
"Where a servitude is claimed over a servient tenement not adjacent to the dominant"
"tenement,  it  must  be  shown  that  the  intervening  tenements  are  subject  to  the  same"
"servitude (Voet 8.4.19). Once a servitude has been acquired, there really comes into"
"existence  one  servitude  over  several  servient  tenements.  That  servitude  is  one  and"
"indivisible. Where the servitude is extinguished with regard to one of the intervenient"
"tenements, the whole servitude is generally extinguished.”"
