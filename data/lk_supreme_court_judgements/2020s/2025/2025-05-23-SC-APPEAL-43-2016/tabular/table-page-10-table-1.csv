"S.C. Appeal 43/2016"
"a declaration of title to the Lot E in the said Plan. The, learned District Judge, as I observed,"
"has not paid his attention to this aspect of the case.”"
"It appears there is a typographical error in what is quoted above, as what would have been"
"meant was that the Plaintiffs had not prayed for a declaration of title and the learned District"
"Judge has not paid his attention to it. On the other hand, Defendants had not claimed title to the"
"Plaintiffs’  land.  While  claiming  a  servitude  of  right  of  way,  they  cannot  claim  title  to  it."
"However, in an actio negatoria filed to deny a servitude, in my view, the Plaintiff, the owner"
"need  not  pray  for  a  declaration  of  title  to  his  land,  but  he  has  to  prove  his  title  to  obtain  a"
"declaration that there is no servitude over his property. As said before, it was common ground"
"at the trial that the ownership of the land in the schedule to the Plaint was with the Plaintiffs."
"Hence, it appears that the learned High Court Judges misconceived that there should be a prayer"
"for declaration of title by the Plaintiff."
"Again,  in  the  Judgment  of  the  High  Court,  the  learned  High  Court  Judges  have  stated  as"
"follows;"
"“The main argument of the Defendant in this case raised before this Court as well as in the"
"District Court was that the Plaintiff has not proved servitude rights over the land described in"
"the schedule to the Plaint.”"
"Here also it is apparent that the learned High Court Judges either misconceived the nature of"
"the case or facts relating to it, since the Plaintiffs’ prayer is to declare that there is no servitude"
"over his land. It appears to be the argument of the Plaintiffs that the Defendants did not prove"
"servitudinal rights over his land."
"As explained above, the Plaintiffs’ title to the land in the schedule to the Plaint was established"
"and, on the other hand, a claim of right of way over it which affects the free enjoyment of"
"Plaintiffs’ ownership rights were also present. Then what had to be looked into by the learned"
"District Judge was whether in fact, such a right of way existed or not."
