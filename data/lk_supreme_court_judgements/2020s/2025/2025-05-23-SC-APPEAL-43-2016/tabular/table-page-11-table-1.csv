"S.C. Appeal 43/2016"
"“There is a rebuttable presumption that the ownership of a thing is unencumbered and free of"
"servitudes.  A  servitude  must  therefore  be  strictly  construed,  that  is,  it  must  be  given  the"
"construction which is the least cumbersome.”"
"G.L Peiris in his book titled ‘The Law of Property in Sri Lanka- Volume.3 – Servitudes"
"and Partition” at page 17 and 18 states as follows;"
"‘It must be noted that a presumption against the existence of a servitude is made by law. As"
"Basnayake J, put in Adonis Fernando v Livera1 “A matter that should always be borne in mind"
"when considering a claim for servitude is that our law does not favour anything in the nature"
"of servitude.”"
"A similar attitude has been adopted by the courts of South Africa. In Van Heerden v Pretorius2"
"Lord de Villiers C.J said “It is settled rule that a person claiming a servitude over the land of"
"another should give clear and convincing proof of the existence of such right.”’"
"The above clearly indicates that in an action in the nature of actio negatoria, once the Plaintiff"
"proves that he is the owner of the land and that there is a threat of claiming a servitude, the"
"party claiming the servitude has to prove the existence of a servitude. Thus, in the case at hand,"
"the  Defendants  have  to  prove  their  stance  of  having  a  servitude  by  prescription  or  in  the"
"alternative, by way of necessity, a right of way over the land of the Plaintiffs described in the"
"schedule to the Plaint."
"Before proceeding further, it is necessary to state this Court’s observations regarding certain"
"documents and facts emanating from or related to them which are relevant to this Judgment."
