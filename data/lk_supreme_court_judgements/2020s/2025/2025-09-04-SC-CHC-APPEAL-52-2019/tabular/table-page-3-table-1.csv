"MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J."
"The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgment of the Commercial"
"High Court dated 21.06.2019."
"The appellant has filed action against the respondent in the trial court to recover"
"a loan facility of Rs. 48 million and the said loan to the respondents had been"
"signed by both parties on 30.11.2009. At the request of the respondents, the said"
"amount was rescheduled to a date one year later."
"The  said  sum,  although  duly  documented  and  mutually  agreed  upon  by  both"
"parties,  had  not  been  transferred  to  the  appellant  in  hand;  rather,  it  had"
"remained in fixed deposits in the appellantâ€™s company."
"The respondents, being eager to commence business operations, had requested"
"for a rescheduling of the above mentioned loan facility on the grounds that the"
"monies were not being released to the respondent as agreed in the terms of the"
"agreement.  Consequently,  the  facility  was  rescheduled,  and  the  deposit  was"
"reduced by Rs. 10 million, which was held as a lien. The remaining amount was"
"regranted  to  the  respondents  on  documents;  however,  the  funds  were  not"
"actually released."
"The appellants have alleged that the respondents had been taken to Court for"
"the entire amount of Rs. 48 million. But the position of the respondent company"
"is that they are liable for Rs. 13 million only and not for the total amount claimed"
"in the plaint."
"The learned trial judge upon considering the evidence presented, had dismissed"
"action of the appellant. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant had"
"filed the instant action."
"According to the evidence led at the trial, an executive from the company of the"
"appellant has been led and according to him, the respondent had been awarded"
"a  loan  of  Rs.  48  million,  but  the  said  monies  had  been  deposited  in  the  fixed"
"deposits of the appellant-company and as the monies were not forthcoming, the"
"respondents had requested the appellant to reschedule the said loan."
"Despite the rescheduling, the respondents had defaulted on the repayment and"
"the appellants had sent a letter of demand, which, according to the appellants,"
"had been ignored by the respondents."
"As such, the appellant has said that the entirety of the monies to be paid had"
"been calculated as Rs. 38 million, plus the interest."
