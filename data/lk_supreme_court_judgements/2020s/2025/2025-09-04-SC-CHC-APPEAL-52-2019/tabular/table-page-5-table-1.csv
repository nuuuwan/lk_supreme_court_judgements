"heavily relied upon by the appellant, indicates the “monies receivable” by the"
"respondent and not the “monies received” by the respondent."
"The  appellant  has  further  averred  that  the  respondents  had  unconditionally"
"agreed that the said sum of Rs. 48 million, referenced in the initial transaction,"
"had been received by the respondent."
"However,  if  one  goes  through  the  said  agreements,  particularly  Clause  7(ii),  it"
"very clearly states that the monies lent had been held in fixed deposits accounts"
"and a lien had been held over the said deposits, which prevents monies being"
"transferred to the respondents."
"The  same  has  been  said  with  regard  to  the  restructured  monies  and  the"
"agreement pertaining to the same."
"Thus, it has to be concluded that the learned trial judge had been correct in his"
"conclusion that the appellant has not established that the monies specified in"
"the agreements signed had been ever transferred to the respondents, and for the"
"dismissal of the plaint."
"Even before this Court, the appellant made extensive submissions relying on the"
"statement  of  accounts  marked  as  P4  and  P9,  asserting  that  the  monies  had"
"passed on to the respondent in totality but I am unable to agree with the same"
"because what both P4 and P9 states is of the sum of monies “receivable” and not"
"monies “received”."
"Hence,  it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  the  appellant  has  failed  to  prove  the"
"matters stated in the plaint before the trial Court."
"Moreover, the agreements marked as P2 and P3 also reiterate in clause 7(ii) that"
"the loaned monies were held in deposits by the appellant’s institution."
"Hence, I see no merit in the submissions of the Counsel for the appellant and I"
"am  compelled  to  dismiss  the  instant  appeal  and  affirm  the  judgment  of  the"
"Commercial High Court dated 21.06.2019."
