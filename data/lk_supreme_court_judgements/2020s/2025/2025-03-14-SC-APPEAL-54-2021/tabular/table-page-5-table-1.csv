"The account no. 670 was opened in the year 1991 and had obtained a personal"
"loan of Rs. 500,000 by the appellant."
"A mortgage bond V1 (at page 376 of the brief) had been signed for this account"
"by  the  no.  9714  to  secure  the  payment  of  the  personal  account  because  the"
"appellant  has  defaulted  and  the  total  sum  due  had  been  accrued  to  Rs"
"1,750,000."
"Thereafter, on 05.10.1995, this facility has been enhanced to Rs. two million and"
"another bond had been signed by the no. 171 marked and produced as V2 (at"
"page  388  of  the  brief),  and  for  both  these  bonds  the  property  belonging  to"
"Wijepala  Weragoda  had  been  mortgaged  because  the  appellant  had  extended"
"credit from account 670 to Wijepala."
"Therefore,  on  documents  marked  as  V1  and  V2,  it  is  clear  that  the  property"
"mortgaged and later auctioned had been pertaining to the account 670 and not"
"pertaining to this account in the instant case because by the time the auction"
"took place the account pertaining to the instant case has not been opened and"
"in operation."
"As the appellant defaulted the repayment, the bank had negotiated to mortgage"
"the property mentioned above and V15 (at page 476 of the brief) had been issued"
"as a result of the said action and it had been with the daughter of Wijepala, but"
"later as the negotiations failed, the bank had passed a resolution to auction the"
"property."
"Wijepala  Weragoda  had  filed  a  land  case  and  had  obtained  an  injunction  to"
"prevent  the  auction  but  the  bank  had  taken  steps  to  get  it  vacated  and  the"
"auction had gone ahead and the bank had recovered the monies pertaining to"
"the  account  no.  670  and  the  excess  monies  had  been  paid  to  the  surviving"
"spouse of Wijepala Weragoda, who by that time had been deceased."
"Thereafter, the appellant had started a business by the name of Sri Lak Motors"
"in the month of September 1995 and had wanted to obtained a loan, which the"
"bank had refused  and had suggested an alternative,  which had been  that the"
"appellant open a business account and obtain a loan (at pages 238-240 of the"
"brief)."
"Therefore, the appellant had taken steps to do that and had opened a business"
"account by the no. 53670, which is the account pertaining to this case and has"
"obtained a sum of Rs 3,453,000 as per P3."
"Thereafter, the appellant has obtained another Rs. 500,000 as per the ledgers"
"P5 and P6."
