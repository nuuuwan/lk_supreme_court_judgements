"I","n the case of Weerawansa  v The Attorney-General and others,8  Fernando, J. held"
"","that  if  a  Detention  Order  under  Section  9(1)  is  obtained  within  72  hours  of  arrest,"
"","there is no necessity to produce the detainee before the Magistrate. In Fernando J’s"
"words, it is as follows:",""
"","“If a Detention Order under section 9(1) is obtained within 72 hours of"
"","arrest, non-production before a judicial officer is excused by section 7(1).”"
"H","owever, I must also mention here for the sake of completeness that in Weerawansa’s"
"case, Fernando, J. went on to hold that the CID had no right to keep the Petitioner in",""
"","that case in custody without producing him before a Magistrate, in terms of section"
"","7(1) as Court had not accepted the assertion by the Respondent in that case that the"
"","Petitioner had been arrested by the CID in accordance with Section 6(1) of the PTA."
"A","s stated above, the CID had arrested the Petitioner on 26-06-2020. The CID as per"
"","Section 7(1) of the PTA has kept the Petitioner in custody for a period not exceeding"
"","seventy-two  hours.  Thereafter,  the  CID  had  kept  him  in  custody  till  the  Detention"
"","Order dated 29-06-2020 (3 R 6) was made in terms of Section 9 of the PTA. Thus,"
"","the said period of custody in CID has not exceeded seventy-two hours as per Section"
"6(1) of the PTA. Therefore, there is no violation of law by the CID in that instance.",""
"A","nother argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that some of"
"","the Detention Orders issued against the Petitioner are not valid. The  Petitioner was"
"","detained under three consecutive Detention Orders, i.e., the detention orders dated"
"8 2000 (1) SLR 387.",""
