s stated above, it is the Petitioner’s stated position in this case that he was arrested"
"while carrying out his duties in the premises of the Police Narcotics Bureau. Therefore,"

"responsibility or at its least, a considerable amount of some shared responsibility for"
"such  illegal  act  must  be  placed  in  the  hands  of  those  who  are  responsible  for  the"
"administration of the PNB premises for it is not the case of the Petitioner that the PNB"
"is a part of the CID. If that is the case, why didn’t the Petitioner make/name any or"
"all officers responsible for the affairs of the PNB as persons who are responsible for"
"arresting  the  Petitioner  within  the  PNB  premises.  This  lapse  on  the  part  of  the"

"occurred within the precincts of the PNB. This is further aggravated by the fact that"
"the 3rd Respondent has denied that the CID had arrested the Petitioner within the PNB"

"Petitioner has succeeded in establishing that the Petitioner was arrested on 26-06-"
"2020, in the premises of PNB which is his own workplace."
