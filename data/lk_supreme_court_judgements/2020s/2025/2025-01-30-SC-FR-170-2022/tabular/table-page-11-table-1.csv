"truthful, the allegations made by the Petitioner against the 4th Respondent that the 4th"
"Respondent  has  acted  mala  fide  against  the  Petitioner.  Such  baseless  allegations"
"would  not  be  strong  enough  to  dispel  the  existence  of  the  reasonable  suspicion"
"entertained by the 3rd Respondent that the Petitioner could be reasonably suspected"
"of or be concerned in some unlawful activity within the meaning of the PTA. Moreover,"
"I must also be mindful that the time at which the 3rd Respondent had entertained the"
"afore-said reasonable suspicion was the time of the arrest of the Petitioner and the"
"said reasonable suspicion was confirmed by the subsequent search conducted at the"
"residence of the Petitioner."
