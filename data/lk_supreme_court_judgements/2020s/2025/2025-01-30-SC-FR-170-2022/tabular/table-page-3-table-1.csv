"Rights  of  the  Petitioner  guaranteed  under  Articles  11,  12(1),  13(1),  13(2),  13(3),"
"13(5), 14(1)(g) and 14(1)(h) of the Constitution."
"I
n light of the above assertions, the primary issue I have to address in this proceeding"
"is the issue as to whether the claim by the Petitioner that he was arrested by the CID"
"while carrying out his duties at the PNB on 26-06-2023 has been established. It is"
"to the said issue that I would now turn."
"I
t is the position of the Petitioner that he was suddenly placed under arrest,1 by the"
"3rd Respondent who had accompanied several individuals clad in civil attire claiming"
"to  be  from  the  CID.  The  submission  of  the  learned  Counsel  who  appeared  for  the"
"Petitioner in the course of the hearing was that the Petitioner was arrested on 26-06-"
"2020,  while  in  the  premises  of  PNB  which  is  his  own  workplace  as  averred  by  the"
"Petitioner himself at paragraph 08 of the Petition."
"I
n order for the Respondents to make an arrest of an officer of the PNB within the"
"premises of the PNB itself as alleged by the Petitioner, it would undoubtedly follow"
"that the superior officers of the PNB are required to have been informed of the carrying"
"out of such an arrest and consequently it should have been only with the permission"
"of such superior officers or at least with their knowledge that the Petitioner could have"
"been arrested."
"H
owever, I observe that the Petitioner has chosen not to name any PNB officer as a"
"Respondent and also chosen not to attribute any responsibility to any PNB officer for"
"allowing  some  other  person  to  arrest  the  Petitioner  inside  the  PNB  premises  itself."
"Although the Petitioner has made CI Ruwan Kumara of PNB as the 4th Respondent in"
"his Petition, that has been done on the basis that it was his complaint which had led"
"to initiate the investigations against the Petitioner by the CID and not on the basis"
"that  the  4th  Respondent  is  responsible  for  his  physical  arrest  and  detention  in  PNB"
"premises."
"1 Paragraph 08 of the Petition dated 06th May 2022."
