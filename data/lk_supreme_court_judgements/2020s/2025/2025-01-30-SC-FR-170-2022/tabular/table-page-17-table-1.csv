"posts  of  both  the  President  and  the  Minister  of  Defence  of  the  country.  Therefore,"
"irrespective  of  the  designation  written  underneath  the  signature,  it  was  the  same"
"individual  who  had  signed.  The  said  individual  should  have  signed  the  Detention"
"Orders after being satisfied that there were adequate grounds to detain the Petitioner."
"Therefore, the main issue for the validity of the Detention Orders would be whether"
"there  were  such  grounds  for  the  issuer  to  detain  the  Petitioner  in  custody.  This  is"
"because the person who had signed the Detention Orders was indeed the Minister of"
"Defence. I have no basis or justification to hold the Detention Orders 3 R 6 and 3 R"
"7  are invalid merely because the designation of the issuer has been mentioned as the"
"President and not as the Minister of Defence in the Detention Orders 3 R 6 and 3 R"
"7. Moreover, I am of the view that this argument is so technical in nature and is not"
"capable  of  persuading  me  to  declare  these  Detention  Orders  invalid  on  that  basis,"
"particularly  in  view  of  the  material  available  against  the  Petitioner  calling  for  the"
"necessity to detain him in custody pending investigation into very serious crimes."
"For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Respondents have not infringed any of the"
"Fundamental  Rights  of  the  Petitioner  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution.  In  the  above"
"circumstances, the Petitioner is not entitled to succeed with his Petition. I proceed to"
"dismiss this Petition with costs."
