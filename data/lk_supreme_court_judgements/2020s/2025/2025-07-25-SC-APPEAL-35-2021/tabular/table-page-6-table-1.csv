"3. The  quotidian  questions  that  usually  arise  in  a  rei  vindicatio  action"
"also come up in this case namely, whether the Plaintiff has proved his"
"title to the property. It is trite law that in a rei vindicatio action, the"
"burden rests on the plaintiff to prove title to the property in dispute,"
"regardless of any deficiencies in the defendant’s case. In evaluating"
"whether the plaintiff has discharged this burden, the defendant’s case"
"may  become  relevant—particularly  where  facts  emerging  from  the"
"defendant’s  evidence,  whether  alone  or  in  conjunction  with  other"
"established facts, support or confirm the plaintiff’s assertion of title."
"Such  facts  may  relate  to  the  existence,  non-existence,  nature,  or"
"extent  of  any  right,  liability,  or  disability  asserted  or  denied  in  the"
"proceedings."
