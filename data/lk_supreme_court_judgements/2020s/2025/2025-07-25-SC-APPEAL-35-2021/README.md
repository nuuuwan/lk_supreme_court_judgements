Argued on: 03.02.2025

Decided on: 25.07. 2025

A.H.M.D. Nawaz,J.

Material Facts

1. The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (the Plaintiff) instituted action

in the District Court of Badulla and sought the following reliefs;

a) A determination that the Plaintiff is entitled to the property

mentioned in schedule X.

P a g e 5 | 11

b) Ejectment of the Defendant-Appellant-Appellants, her agents and

representatives from the property mentioned in schedule X, and

grant of undisturbed and clear possession of the said property;

c) An order on the Defendants to pay damages of Rs. 15,000/- per

month with effect from the date of the action being instituted, until

undisturbed and clear possession of the property is granted to the

Plaintiff.

2. Both the District Court and Provincial High Court of the Uva Province

have held against the Defendants. In a nutshell the reliefs claimed by

the Plaintiff in (a), (b) and (c) have been granted to the Plaintiff. This

Court has granted leave to the Defendants on the following questions

of law;

a) Has the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge erred by failing

to recognize that the Respondent has failed to read in evidence of

the documents that have been led during the trial and relying on

the said documents for the purpose of the Judgment?

b) Has the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge erred in law by

failing to recognize that the documents marked P-9, P-12 and P-13

have been produced in evidence in contravention of the provisions

of Section 160 of the Civil Procedure Code and relying on the said

documents for the purpose of the Judgment?

c) Has the Civil Appellate High Court Judge erred in law by failing to

appreciate the evidence that has been led by the Petitioners in

respect of the acquisition by the Petitioners of prescriptive rights in

respect of the land in dispute?

P a g e 6 | 11

3. The quotidian questions that usually arise in a rei vindicatio action

also come up in this case namely, whether the Plaintiff has proved his

title to the property. It is trite law that in a rei vindicatio action, the

burden rests on the plaintiff to prove title to the property in dispute,

regardless of any deficiencies in the defendants case. In evaluating

whether the plaintiff has discharged this burden, the defendants case

may become relevantparticularly where facts emerging from the

defendants evidence, whether alone or in conjunction with other

established facts, support or confirm the plaintiffs assertion of title.

Such facts may relate to the existence, non-existence, nature, or

extent of any right, liability, or disability asserted or denied in the

proceedings.

4. The word proof in Section 3 encompasses consideration of all matters

before Court in terms of Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance and the

definition of the word proved contained in Section 3 applies

generally to all the provisions of the Ordinance.

5. Thus, the documents marked by the Plaintiff namely, P4, P5, P6, P7

and P8 on the basis that the they were written by the Defendants

acknowledging title in the Plaintiff is a relevant fact that goes to prove

the fact in issue namely whether the Plaintiff had proprietary title in

the land and moreover, apart from the fact that the acknowledgement

of title in the Plaintiff emanates from the above documents, Plaintiffs

title flows from a bestowal conferred upon the Plaintiff by virtue of a

settlement order published under the Land Settlement Ordinance.

That title traceable to the settlement order was not seriously

impugned before this Court and as such, it should be taken that the

title of the plaintiff by virtue of the settlement order has been

established without any scintilla of doubt.

P a g e 7 | 11

6. Further, the Plaint averred that the original Plaintiff was the wife of

the deceased of the deceased claimant out of whom 07 children had

conveyed their undivided shares to their mother, the original plaintiff,

by Deeds marked P16 and P17 at the trial. The above Deeds were

not objected to or subjected to proof by the Defendants.

7. Thus, it is clear the title of the Plaintiff has been clearly established

at the trial. Accordingly, the onus would now shift to the Defendants

to establish their legal entitlement to be in possession of the land in

question.

8. The Defendants plead adverse possession or ut dominus possession to

establish prescriptive title. Both Courts have held against the

Defendants on any claim of prescriptive title. It is the case of the

Plaintiff that the Defendants commenced their possession by leave

and license. The documents marked at the trial and the tenor, nature

and contents of the letter marked P4, P5, P6, and P7 demonstrate

the subordinate character and permissive possession on the part of

the Defendants.

9. The document P4 dated 24.04.2022 acknowledges the permission

granted to cultivate the land of the Plaintiff. It is written by Kumari

who was the daughter of Siyathu-the licensee. The same writer

communicates the expenses incurred to build a wall by P5 dated

25.02.2006.

P a g e 8 | 11

10. P6 dated 15.03.2006 informs the Plaintiff that the Defendants

received notice asking them to do some work on the land. It is a letter

written by Siyathu, the aforesaid licensee. P7 notifies the death of

Siyathu by his daughter Premawathie-the 1st defendant in the case.

The Document P8 is a request for a sum of Rs. 20,000/- to bring the

land under cultivation. All these documents show permissive

possession on the part of the Defendants and these assertions prove

that prescription had not begun to operate. The documents clearly

demonstrate that the Defendants occupied the land by virtue of the

Plaintiffs leave and license, and that they recognized the Plaintiff as

their landlord. Section 115 of the Evidence Ordinance embodies the

principle of estoppel as articulated in Pickard v. Sears, preventing a

party from denying a representation they have allowed another to rely

upon. Furthermore, Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance

establishes the doctrine of estoppel by tenancy, which bars a tenant

from disputing the title of the landlord during the subsistence of the

tenancy. Taken together, these provisions reinforce the conclusion

that the Defendants cannot approbate and reprobate in respect of the

nature of their possession.

11. I must at this stage state that when documents P4 P8 were marked

at the trail, there was repudiation of them by the Defendants as the

Counsel for the Defendants denied that they were sent by the

Defendants. However, it must be recalled that when the Plaintiff

closed his case on 10.09.2015, there were no objections to the

admissibility of these documents.

12. To establish the first question of lawnamely, that the Plaintiff

failed to read the documents in evidence at the close of his caseit

was argued before this Court that there was no specific reference to

P a g e 9 | 11

the term documents marked in the case. The submission was that an

express reference to documents is required at the conclusion of the

Plaintiffs case for such documents to be treated as read in evidence.

13. In the present case, when the Plaintiff closed his case on 10.09.2015,

he did so using a general statement to the effect that the case was

being closed upon the evidence led. It was contended that the

omission of any specific mention of documents in this closing

statement implies that the marked documents were not formally read

into evidence.

14. I would hold this argument to be fallacious and contrary to the spirit

of the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance.

15. In terms of Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance, the word Evidence

means and includes a. oral evidence, b. documentary evidence.

Therefore, a reference to the nomenclature evidence would include

documentary evidence that has been already led in the case and thus

the subordinate character of the Defendants possession has been

clearly established by the documents marked.

16. This landlord and tenant relationship is further strengthened by

documents P9 and P10. P9 is a complaint made at the Kandeketiya

Police by the Plaintiff regarding the unauthorized mortgage of some

produce from the land to other persons.

17. In response, Premawathie, the 1st Defendant in the case made a

statement marked P10 wherein she clearly admitted that they were

P a g e 10 | 11

occupying the subject matter under the leave and license of the

Plaintiff. The document marked P13 is a representation that the

Plaintiffs predecessor in title is the owner of the land. The Civil

Appellate Court has also referred to the 2nd admission recorded at the

trial on the 02.09.2013, wherein leave and license and a quit notice

terminating the leave and license had been admitted by the

Defendants. A careful perusal of the admission reveals that the

Defendants have admitted the Respondents title and they were

license holders of the land in question. Thus, adverse possession or

ouster of the Plaintiff has not been proved by the Defendants who

have not, in the circumstances, established the onus of proving that

they have a superior title by virtue of their prescriptive possession-

See De Silva Vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue ;

A person who bases his title in adverse possession must show by clear

and unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile to the real

owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property claimed.

18. An argument has been made that the document marked P12 and P13

were produced in evidence in contravention of the provisions of

Section 160 of the Civil Procedure Code. However, when these

documents were produced, no objections were raised. The said

Premawathie never referred to these documents in her evidence and

controverted them. Therefore, the question of law raised on the basis

of Section 160 of the Civil Procedure Code is unwarranted and has to

be answered against the Defendants. Accordingly, there is sufficient

material on record to establish that the Defendants have not acquired

prescriptive title to the land in question. Consequently, the judgments

of both the District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court were

P a g e 11 | 11

correctly entered, being firmly supported by relevant and admissible

evidence.

19. Accordingly, I affirm the judgment of the District Court dated

02.10.2018 and that of the High Court dated 01.06.2020. In the

circumstances, the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant-Appellants

stands dismissed.
