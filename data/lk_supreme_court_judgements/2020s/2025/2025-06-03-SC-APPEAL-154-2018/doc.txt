Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the 3rd defendant-respondent-appellant (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 3rd defendant-appellant or 3rd defendant) on the

basis of being aggrieved by the judgment pronounced on 30-10-2017, by the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Awissawella while

exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction.

From the impugned judgment, the learned Judges of the High Court set aside

the judgment pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge of

Awissawella on 27-10-2016, where the partition action instituted by the

plaintiff in District Court of Awissawella Case No. P/22233 was dismissed on

Page 7 of 20

the basis that the said plaintiff failed to establish the original owner of the

land sought to be partitioned to the satisfaction of the Court.

From the impugned judgment, the learned High Court Judges determined

that in fact, the plaintiff of the District Court action has sufficiently proved

the original owner of the land sought to be partitioned, and has proceeded to

pronounce a judgment after having considered the corpus sought to be

partitioned and the title pleaded by the parties in relation to the points of

contest raised.

It has been determined that the corpus should be divided as stated in the

appellate judgment.

When the application for Leave to Appel preferred by the 3rd defendant of the

partition action was supported before this Court, Leave to Appeal was allowed

on 05-10-2018 based on sub-paragraphs 3 and 4 of paragraph 29 of the

petition dated 05-12-2017.

The said questions of law read as follows,

1. Was there any admissible evidence before the trial Court to hold that

Pussewelage Podisingho and Wewalpanawa Gamage Podisingho is

one and the same person?

2. Did the learned High Court Judge err in law and fact in holding

same?

At the hearing of this appeal, it was submitted by the learned President’s

Counsel on behalf of the 3rd defendant-appellant that he is not disputing the

identity of the corpus as lot E of the Final Partition Plan No. 17 dated 09-08-

1954 made by Licenced Surveyor C. Thamby in District Court of Awissawella

Partition Case No. 3375, and the fact that the said land has been correctly

depicted in the preliminary Survey Plan No. 707 dated 24-09-2003 by the

Commissioner appointed for the action, namely, Licensed Surveyor M.

Kaluthanthri.

Page 8 of 20

He did not dispute the fact that according to the final partition decree, the

said lot E was allocated to Pussewelage Podisingho, who was the 8th defendant

of the mentioned Partition Action No. 3375.

However, he strongly contended that the plaintiff-appellant-respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff) of the action failed to establish her

claim that the said original owner Pussewelage Podisingho was also known as

Pussallage alias Wewalpanawa Gamage Podisingho as claimed by her in her

plaint in order to establish the original owner of the land sought to be

partitioned.

It was his view that the learned Additional District Judge of Awissawella was

correct on facts as well as the law, when the partition action was dismissed

on the basis that the plaintiff failed to establish the original owner of the land,

and therefore, had failed to prove the title as claimed by her to the satisfaction

of the Court.

It was submitted that the learned Additional District Judge was correct in

determining that the plaintiff’s failure to substantiate her claim by producing

the relevant birth certificates, death certificates etc. was sound reasoning in

that regard. It was submitted further that the deeds relied on by the parties

to claim rights over the corpus to be partitioned, does not support the

contention as to the original ownership of the corpus on a basis that the

person who became entitled to the corpus in the final partition decree is one

and the same person as claimed by the plaintiff. It was his position that

although at the commencement of the trial, two admissions have been

recorded as to the original ownership, that admission would not prevent the

3rd defendant who entered the case after the initial recording of the

admissions and points of contest, from challenging the original ownership

claimed by the plaintiff.

It was contended by the learned President’s Counsel that the learned Judges

of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Awissawella

were misdirected as to the relevant law when it was decided to set aside the

judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Awissawella and

Page 9 of 20

pronounce a judgment, where partitioning of the land sought to be partitioned

was ordered.

The plaintiff has instituted this action in terms of the Partition Law by the

plaint dated 23-05-2001, seeking to partition the land mentioned in the

schedule of the plaint. Although she has named only one defendant, the 2nd

defendant had been subsequently added as a party.

The 2nd and the 3rd paragraphs of the plaint reads as follows,

2. මෙහි පහත උපමෙඛනමේ වඩාත් විස්තර කරන ඉඩෙ අවිස්සාමේල්ෙ දිසා අධිකරණ

අංක 3357 දරන මෙදුම් නඩුමේ අවසාන තීන්දදු ප්‍රකාශය අනුව හිමිවුමේ මේවැල්පනාව

ගෙමේ මනාමහාත් පුස්සැල්ෙමේ මපාඩිසංම ෝ නෙැති අයට ය.

3. ඉහත මේදමේ සඳහන්ද මපාඩිසංම ෝ මියගිමයන්ද ඔහුමේ අයිතිවාසකම් මම්රිමනෝනා,

දාවිත්සංම ෝ, සුගතන්දසංම ෝ (1වී) හා මේවිට් යන අයට හිමිවිය.

When the matter was taken up for trial on 19-09-2005, parties to the action

had admitted the above-mentioned 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of the plaint, which

were averments relating to the original owner of the land as well as the

persons who inherited from the original owner.

The trial has commenced by recording 1st to 7th points of contest on behalf of

the plaintiff, and 8th to 13th points of contest on behalf of the 1st defendant of

the action, and 14th to 16th points of contest on behalf of the 2nd defendant of

the action.

However, after the plaintiff has concluded her evidence, and the evidence of

the 1st defendant of the action was to commence, the 3rd defendant has

intervened to the case, claiming that he had no knowledge of the partition

action and he is entitled to lot 1 and 2 of the preliminary plan based on

prescriptive rights. The said application had been allowed by the learned trial

Judge, while an application by the 4th and the 5th defendants of the action to

intervene has also been allowed. The said intervening parties have filed their

respective statements of claims accordingly.

The claim of the 3rd defendant had been that although the land sought to be

partitioned was lot E of the previous Partition Action No. 3367 of the

Page 10 of 20

Awissawella District Court, even after the entering of the final decree of the

said action, his father, namely Edwin Singho, was in possession of lot 1 and

2 of the preliminary Plan No. 707 prepared for the purposes of the partition

action under appeal. The 3rd defendant had claimed his father, therefore,

secured prescriptive rights to the said two lots, and on his demise, he is

entitled to the ownership of the said two lots. On that basis, he has claimed

the exclusion of lot 1 and 2 from the corpus to be partitioned.

It is clear from the statement of claim by the 3rd defendant that he has not

raised any dispute as to the original ownership of the land as previously

admitted by the parties.

The 4th and 5th defendants of the action, who were also subsequently added

as parties, had also relied on the pedigree as stated by the plaintiff to claim

their rights to the corpus sought to be partitioned.

When the further trial was recommenced on 02-08-2012, the 4th and the 5th

defendants of the partition action have recorded points of contest No. 17 to

21 claiming rights for undivided 20 perches of land from the corpus based on

the title pleaded by the plaintiff, while the 3rd defendant has raised points of

contest No. 24 to 27 on the basis that he has prescriptive rights to lot 1 and

2 of the land depicted in the preliminary plan, and the said lots should be

excluded from the corpus to be partitioned.

It needs to be noted that the 3rd defendant has not raised any contest in his

statement of claim as to the original ownership of the land as claimed by the

plaintiff, and neither when he was allowed to raise his points of contest, other

than claiming the exclusion as pleaded by him.

If it was his position that he is not in agreement with the admissions recorded

before he was added as a party, it was up to him to bring it to the attention of

the learned trial Judge and move them to be removed or altered, which has

also not been done.

When the trial recommenced on 04-10-2012, it was the 1A substituted

defendant of the action who has given evidence representing the then

deceased 1st defendant.

Page 11 of 20

He too has gone on the basis that lot E of the previous partition action was

allocated to the original owner Wewalpanawa Gamage Podisingho who was

his grandfather, and has pleaded title under him as pleaded by the 1st

defendant, though he has pleaded for a dismissal of the action.

When cross-examined on behalf of the 3rd defendant as to the original owner

of the land in terms of the previous partition action, the witness has stated as

follows (at page 162 of the appeal brief).

Page 12 of 20

When it was the turn of the 3rd defendant-appellant of the action to give

evidence before the trial Court, other than claiming prescriptive title for lot 1

and 2 of the land sought to be partitioned, he has not specifically taken up

the position that the admitted original owner in terms of the previous partition

action, namely Pussewelage Podisingho, was not a person also known as

Wewalpanawa Gamage Podisingho as claimed by the plaintiff, other than

claiming that the plaintiffs and others who claimed title to the property does

not derive rights from the person who became entitled to the lot E of the

previous partition action.

However, it needs to be noted that when cross-examined on behalf of the other

defendants of the partition action, it appears that he has maintained the

position that Wewalpanawa Gamage Podisingho and Pussewelage Podisingho

are not one and the same person.

As I have stated previously, it is clear from the judgment dated 27-10-2016

pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge of Awissawella, the

partition action has been dismissed solely on the basis that the plaintiff has

not established the fact that Pussawelage Podisingho alias Pussalla Gamage

Podisingho or Wewalpanawa Gamage Podisingho alias Pussallage Podisingho

was one and the same person.

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the relevant point of contest 01

and the answer to it, which reads as follows,

1. මදක පිළිගැනීමම් සඳහන්ද දාවිත් සංම ෝ අවිවාහකව මහෝ පැවැත්ෙක් නැතිව මිය ගිමයන්ද

ඔහුමේ අයිතිය මම්රි මනෝනා, සුගතන්ද හා මේවිේ සංම ෝ ට හිමි මේද?

ගෙමේ මපාඩිසංම ෝ මනාමහාත් පුස්සැල්ෙමේ මපාඩිසංම ෝ යන අය එකෙ අයකු ෙව

තහවුරු කර මනාෙැත).

Page 13 of 20

In view of the answer to the above point of contest, the rest of the points of

contest had been answered as ‘not relevant’, other than the points of contest

relating to the identity of the corpus to be partitioned.

The learned Additional District Judge has determined that the identity of the

land sought to be partitioned is correctly depicted in the preliminary plan

prepared by the Commissioner appointed for the purposes of the action.

The points of contest raised on behalf of the 3rd defendant who claimed

prescriptive rights to lot 1 and 2 of the land sought to be partitioned has also

answered stating that the 3rd defendant has failed to prove prescription.

When the dismissal of the partition action was challenged by the plaintiff

before the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in

Awissawella, the learned Judges of the High Court exercising its civil appellate

jurisdiction, has determined that the learned Additional District Judge was

wrong to have expected the relevant parties to produce birth certificate,

marriage certificate or death certificate to establish the original owner of the

land as one and the same person mentioned in the plaint.

Accordingly, the learned High Court Judges have proceeded to consider the

admissions recorded as well as the deeds produced by the parties to claim

their rights, and the evidence adduced before the trial Court to conclude that

there was sufficient evidence before the trial Court as to the original owner

claimed by the plaintiff and the other parties who claimed rights from the

original owner.

It has also been determined that there was sufficient evidence to conclude

that the original owner named in the action, namely Pussewelage Podisingho,

who became the owner of the corpus to be partitioned, was one and the same

person claimed by the plaintiff and others as Wewalpanawa Gamage alias

Pussallage Podisingho, and hence, the learned Additional District Judge could

have pronounced a positive judgment ordering the partitioning of the land

sought to be partitioned.

Page 14 of 20

Accordingly, the learned Judges of the High Court have proceeded to

pronounce the impugned judgment, where the partitioning of the land sought

to be partitioned has been ordered allocating 20 perches in common to 2nd,

4th and 5th defendants, while allocating an undivided 5/12 share to the

plaintiff, undivided 5/12 share to the 1st defendant and keeping an undivided

2/12 share unallocated from the balance portion of the land sought to be

partitioned. It has been determined that the 3rd defendant has failed to prove

prescriptive rights to lot 1 and 2 of the lands shown in the preliminary plan,

and the said lots should be part of the corpus, contrary to the contention of

the 3rd defendant that the said lots should be excluded.

It is trite law that in a partition action, it is the duty of the trial Judge to

examine the identity of the land sought to be partitioned and come to a firm

finding in relation to that, and also to examine the title pleaded by the parties

to come to a finding as to the title as well, before deciding to order a

partitioning of the land in terms of the Partition Law.

In the case of Piyaseeli Vs. Mendis (2003) 3 SLR 273, it was held,

“1. The main function of a trial Judge in a partition action is to investigate

title, it is a necessary prerequisite for every partition action.

2. Partition decrees cannot be the subject of a private agreement between

the parties on matters of title which the Court is bound by law to examine.

There is a greater need for the exercise of judicial caution before a decree

is entered.”

It was held in the case of Sopinona Vs. Cornelis (2010) BLR 109 SC,

1. It is necessary to conduct a thorough investigation in a partition action as

it is instituted to determine the question of title and such investigation

devolves on the Court.

2. In a partition suit which is considered to be a proceeding taken for the

prevention or redress of a wrong it would be the prime duty of the trial

Judge to carefully examine and investigate the actual rights and title to

the land sough to be partitioned.

Page 15 of 20

3. In that process it would be essential for the trial Judge to consider the

evidence led on the points of contest and answer all the points of contest

raised as issues stating as to why those are accepted or rejected.

However, it is well settled law that the original ownership of a land is not

always placed on a very high degree of proof.

In the case of, Gunasinghe Vs. Podi Amma and Others (2009) 1 SLR 174,

per Abdul Salam, J.;

“It is trite law that proof of original ownership of a land is not always

placed at a very high degree and as such the plaintiff should have been

shown some leniency relating to the proof of original ownership.”

In the case of Magilin Perera Vs. Abraham Perera (1986) 2 SLR 208, it was

observed by Goonewardene, J. that,

“When a partition action is instituted, the plaintiff must perforce indicate

an original owner or owners of the land. A plaintiff having to commence

at some point, such owner or owners need not necessarily be the very

first owner or owners and even if it be so claimed such claim need not

necessarily and in every instance be correct because when such an

original owner is shown it could theoretically and actually be possible to

go back to still an earlier owner. Such questions being rooted in antiquity

it would be correct to say as a general statement that it could be well nigh

impossible to trace back the very first owner of the land. The fact that

there was or may have been an original owner or owners in the same

chain of title, prior to the one shown by the plaintiff if it be so established

need, not necessarily result in the case of the plaintiff failing. In like

manner if it be seen that the original owner is in point of fact someone

lower down in the chain of title that the one shown by the plaintiff that

again by itself need not ordinarily defeat the plaintiff’s action. Therefore,

in actual practice it is the usual, and in my view sensible, attitude of the

Courts that it would not be reasonable to expect proof within very high

degrees of probability on questions such as those relating to the original

ownership of land. Courts by and large countenance infirmities in this

Page 16 of 20

regard, if infirmities they be, in an approach which is realistic rather than

legalistic, as to do otherwise would be to put the relief given by partition

decrees outside of the reach of very many persons seeking to end their

co-ownership.

It is in this perspective and again such a background I think that this

matter must be viewed.”

Section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance relates to statements by persons who

cannot be called as witnesses. I find that section 32(5) as relevant in the

context of this case, where the 1st defendant has spoken about the way he

came to know the fact that the original owner was known as Wewalpanawa

Gamage alias Pussallage Podisingho.

The relevant 32(5) of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows,

32(5). When the statement relates to the existence of any

relationship by blood, marriage, or adoption between persons as to

whose relationship by blood, marriage, or adoption the person

making the statement had special means of knowledge and when

the statement was made before the question in dispute was raised.

The case of P.M. Cooray Vs. M.A.P. Wijesuriya 62 NLR 158 was a case where

the relevancy of the evidence otherwise known as ‘hearsay evidence’ in a

partition action was considered.

Per Sinnetamby, J.

“The relevant provisions of the Evidence Ordinance in regard to a

proof of a pedigree are to be found in section 32(5), section 32(6)

and section 50(2). I am omitting for the moment proof by the

production of birth, death and marriage certificates. It almost

always happens that birth and death certificates of persons who

have died long ago are not available: in such cases the only way

of establishing relationship is by hearsay evidence. Section 32(5)

of the Evidence Ordinance renders a statement made by a

deceased person admissible.

Page 17 of 20

“When the statement relates to the existence of any relation by

blood, marriage or adoption between persons as to whose

relationship by blood, marriage or adoption the person making the

statement had special means of knowledge and when the

statement was made before the question in dispute was raised.”

It is under this provision of law that oral evidence of pedigree is

sought to be led. What practitioners and the court sometimes lose

sight of is the fact that before such evidence can be led there must

be proof that hearsay evidence sought to be given is in respect of

a statement made by a person having special means of knowledge:

furthermore, it must have been made ante litem motam. Where the

statement is made by a member of the family such knowledge may

be inferred or even presumed, but where it is a statement made by

an outsider, proof of special means of knowledge must first be

established.”

In his evidence, the 1st defendant has clearly stated that the admitted original

owner Podisingho was his grandfather, and has claimed rights under his

father SugathanSingho from whom he has come to know that his grandfather

was known as Pussewelage Podisingho¸ and was also known as Wewalpanawa

Gamage Podisingho. Therefore, I am of the view that such knowledge that

came through a member of the family can be inferred and presumed.

When it comes to the facts relating to the case under appeal, there had been

no dispute that the land sought to be partitioned had been allocated to one

Pussewelage Podisingho, who was the 8th defendant in District Court of

Awissawella Partition Action No. 3357. The plaintiff, the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th

defendants in the partition action have claimed rights based on the person

who became entitled to lot E in the said partition action.

It is my view that the only question that needs determination would be

whether the said Pussewelage Podisingho was also known as Wewalpanawa

Gamage Podisingho and/or Pussallage Podisingho as claimed by the parties

who has claimed rights to the corpus or whether Pussewelage Podisingho was

Page 18 of 20

not one and the same person known as above as claimed by the 3rd defendant-

appellant.

In order to reach a finding in that regard, a trial Judge will have to look at the

evidence placed before the Court in its totality, and not in its isolation. In that

process, it becomes necessary to consider documentary, oral, as well as other

attendant circumstances in that regard. It is also necessary to draw the

attention to the admissions recorded and the points of contest raised by the

parties as well, in investigating title in a partition action.

As I have stated before, at the very outset of the trial, parties have admitted

the 2nd and the 3rd averment of the plaint, which relates to the identity of the

original owner of the land and those who became entitled to the land upon

his death.

Although the 3rd defendant-appellant has entered the case after the recording

of the above admissions and the conclusion of the plaintiff’s evidence, when

it was his turn to raise his points of contest, he has never decided to challenge

the admissions which were previously recorded by the parties.

It is clear from the case record that, when the 3rd defendant raised his points

of contest, it was well within his knowledge that the admissions have been

recorded as to the original owner and his identity.

It needs to be noted that, the 4th and the 5th defendants of the partition action

had recorded their points of contest on the same day as the 3rd defendant, but

before the 3rd defendant recorded his points of contest (page 154 of the appeal

brief). This goes on to show that even they have relied on the assertion of the

plaintiff as to the original ownership and devolution of title.

I find that since it is on the points of contest raised by the parties, a partition

action would be determined, there was no impediment for the 3rd defendant-

appellant to raise such a point of contest as he is now relying on to argue this

appeal, at the appropriate stage of the case, which he has not chosen to do

so.

It is clear from the evidence placed before the trial Court that neither the

plaintiff nor the 3rd defendant has actually seen the person who became

entitled to the lot E in the previous Partition Action No. 3357, and all of them

had relied on what they were told by their fathers in that regard.

I am of the view that since a person, although he may have one name, can

use another name in his day-to-day affairs for various reasons, and that in

itself would not mean that he was not one and the same person.

I find that in the deed marked 2V1, namely Deed No. 465, attested on 07-06-

1956, the person who became entitled to the lot E in Partition Action No. 3357

has transferred his rights identifying him as Pussawelage Podisingho alias

Pussalla Gamage Podisingho, which shows that the original owner has not

used the same name even soon after the final partition decree, which has been

entered on 1st June 1955. Therefore, it can be safely assumed that the

children of the original owner have used their name as Wewalpanawa

Gamage, which may have been the reason why the deeds written after the

death of the original owner refers to their names as Wewalpanawa Gamage

rather than Pussewelage.

It is my considered view that if the learned Additional District Judge carefully

examined the title pleaded by the parties who are entitled to shares from the

corpus to be partitioned, there was no impediment for the learned Judge to

determine as to the title of the parties and to pronounce a decree ordering the

partitioning of the land sought to be partitioned.

For the reasons as set out above, I find that the learned Judges of the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Awissawella were

correct in deciding to set aside the judgment of the learned Additional District

Judge and proceed to pronounce a proper partition judgment having

considered the claim for prescription made by the 3rd defendant in that regard

as well.

Hence, I find no reasons to interfere with the appellate judgment pronounced

by the learned judges of the Provincial High Court.

Accordingly, I answer the 1st question of law in the affirmative, and the 2nd

question of law in the negative.

The appellate judgment dated 30-10-2017 pronounced by the learned Judges

of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Awissawella,

while exercising civil appellate jurisdiction, is hereby affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed. There will be no costs of the appeal.
