"He did not dispute  the fact  that according to the final partition decree, the"
"said lot E was allocated to Pussewelage Podisingho, who was the 8th defendant"
"of the mentioned Partition Action No. 3375."
"However,  he  strongly  contended 
that 
the  plaintiff-appellant-respondent"
"(hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  plaintiff)  of  the  action  failed  to  establish  her"
"claim that the said original owner Pussewelage Podisingho was also known as"
"Pussallage alias Wewalpanawa Gamage Podisingho as claimed by her in her"
"plaint  in  order  to  establish  the  original  owner  of  the  land  sought  to  be"
"partitioned."
"It was his view that the learned Additional District Judge of Awissawella was"
"correct on facts as well as the law, when the partition action was dismissed"
"on the basis that the plaintiff failed to establish the original owner of the land,"
"and therefore, had failed to prove the title as claimed by her to the satisfaction"
"of the Court."

"person who became entitled to the corpus in the final partition decree is one"
"and  the  same  person  as  claimed  by  the  plaintiff.  It  was  his  position  that"
"although  at  the  commencement  of  the  trial,  two  admissions  have  been"
"recorded as to the original ownership, that admission would not prevent the"
"3rd  defendant  who  entered 
the  case  after 
the 
initial  recording  of 
the"
"admissions  and  points  of  contest, from  challenging  the  original  ownership"
"claimed by the plaintiff."
"It was contended by the learned President’s Counsel that the learned Judges"
"of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Awissawella"
"were misdirected as to the relevant law when it was decided to set aside the"
"judgment  of 
the 
learned  Additional  District  Judge  of  Awissawella  and"
