"It is under this provision of law that oral evidence of pedigree is"
"sought to be led. What practitioners and the court sometimes lose"
"sight of is the fact that before such evidence can be led there must"
"be proof that hearsay evidence sought to be given is in respect of"
"a statement made by a person having special means of knowledge:"

"statement is made by a member of the family such knowledge may"
"be inferred or even presumed, but where it is a statement made by"
"an  outsider,  proof  of  special  means  of  knowledge  must  first  be"
"established.”"
