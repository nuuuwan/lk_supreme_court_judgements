"evidence led on the points of contest and answer all the points of contest"

"However,  it  is  well  settled  law  that  the  original  ownership  of  a  land  is  not"

"per Abdul Salam, J.;"
"“It  is  trite  law  that  proof  of  original  ownership  of  a  land  is  not  always"
"placed at a very high degree and as such the plaintiff should have been"
"shown some leniency relating to the proof of original ownership.”"

"“When a partition action is instituted, the plaintiff must perforce indicate"
"an original owner or owners of the land. A plaintiff having to commence"
