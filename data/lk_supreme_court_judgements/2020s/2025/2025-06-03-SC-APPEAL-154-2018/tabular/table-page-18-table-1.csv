"not one and the same person known as above as claimed by the 3rd defendant-"
"appellant."
"In order to reach a finding in that regard, a trial Judge will have to look at the"
"evidence placed before the Court in its totality, and not in its isolation. In that"
"process, it becomes necessary to consider documentary, oral, as well as other"
"attendant  circumstances  in  that  regard.  It  is  also  necessary  to  draw  the"
"attention to the admissions recorded and the points of contest raised by the"
"parties as well, in investigating title in a partition action."
"As I have stated before, at the very outset of the trial, parties have admitted"
"the 2nd and the 3rd averment of the plaint, which relates to the identity of the"
"original owner of the land and those who became entitled to the land upon"
"his death."
"Although the 3rd defendant-appellant has entered the case after the recording"
"of the above admissions and the conclusion of the plaintiffâ€™s evidence, when"
"it was his turn to raise his points of contest, he has never decided to challenge"
"the admissions which were previously recorded by the parties."
"It is clear from the case record that, when the 3rd defendant raised his points"
"of contest, it was well within  his knowledge that  the admissions  have been"
"recorded as to the original owner and his identity."
"It needs to be noted that, the 4th and the 5th defendants of the partition action"
"had recorded their points of contest on the same day as the 3rd defendant, but"
"before the 3rd defendant recorded his points of contest (page 154 of the appeal"
"brief). This goes on to show that even they have relied on the assertion of the"
"plaintiff as to the original ownership and devolution of title."
"I find that since it is on the points of contest raised by the parties, a partition"
"action would be determined, there was no impediment for the 3rd defendant-"
"appellant to raise such a point of contest as he is now relying on to argue this"
"appeal, at the appropriate stage of the case, which he has not chosen to do"
"so."
