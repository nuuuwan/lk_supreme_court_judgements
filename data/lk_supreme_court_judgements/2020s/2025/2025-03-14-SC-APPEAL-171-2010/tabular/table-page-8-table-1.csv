"(as commission paid to the post office), I am unable to reject the assertion made by the Tenant"
"Cultivator that the Landlord had continued to refuse to accept the cash payment attempted by the"
"Tenant  Cultivator  previously.  The  fact  that  the  Landlord  has  refused  to  accept  the  payment"
"previously, is corroborated by his action of returning the two money orders with his letter dated"
"04-08-1995 (A6). Moreover, the motive of the Landlord for continuous refusal of acceptance of"
"payment of arrears made by the Tenant Cultivator is shown clearly from his request dated 24-11-"
"1995 (A8) whereby he had moved the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services to terminate"
"the tenancy rights of the Tenant Cultivator on the basis that the Tenant Cultivator had defaulted"
"the payment of arrears of rent."
