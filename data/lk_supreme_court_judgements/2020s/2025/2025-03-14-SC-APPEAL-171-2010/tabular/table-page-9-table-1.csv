"[SC Appeal 171/2010] Page 9 of 9"
"on this judgment, the learned Counsel for the Landlord sought to argue that the Tenant Cultivator"
"has in reality forfeited his tenancy. However, I would not proceed to consider this judgment at"
"this  stage.  This  is  because  there  is  a  threshold  requirement  which  the  Landlord  has  to  satisfy"
"before he could argue on this line. The Landlord must first establish that the Tenant Cultivator has"
"defaulted the payment in arrears as directed by the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services"
"as the threshold requirement. I have already held that the Tenant Cultivator has made the payment"
"of arrears of rent by 29-04-1994. Therefore, for the purpose of this judgment, I need not proceed"
"either to consider the above judgment or to interpret Section 18 of the Agrarian Services Act."
