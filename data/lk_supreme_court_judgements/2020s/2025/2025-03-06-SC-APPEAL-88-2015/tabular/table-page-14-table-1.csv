"1937, so that at the time the petition of appeal was filed the said proctor was"
"the proctor on record. As the petition of appeal was not signed by the proctor"
"on record on 12.11.37, the date on which the appeal was filed, the Supreme"
"Court rejected the petition of appeal. Maartensz, J. summed up the principle"
"decided in the previous cases as follows :"
"""The ratio decidendi in old cases, with which I respectfully agree was"
"that this Court cannot recognize two proctors appearing for the same"
"party in the same cause""."
"The learned President's Counsel for the respondent relying on the principle set"
"out above submitted that in the same manner a party and his attorney-at-law"
"on record cannot appear at the same time. The President's Counsel for the"
"appellant submitted that to introduce after the words ""shall be signed by the"
"appellant"", the words 'who has no attorney-at-law on record' would be contrary"
"to the plain understanding of the section."
"I

"should be interpreted firstly in relation to the principles set out by the long series"

"proceedings. Permitting either the appellant or the attorney-at-law to sign the"
"petition of appeal would mean that two parties are acting at the same time in"
"the course of the proceedings of a case. Further, permitting such a practice"
"would lead to disorder and confusion in Court proceedings. The words ""shall be"
"s
i

"i
n
terpreted to mean that the petition of appeal can be signed by the appellant"
"when he has no registered attorney on record. Under the Administration of"
"Justice Law such a situation would have arisen under section 378 (3) of the"
"Administration of Justice (Amendment) Law No. 25 of 1975, if any one of the"
"i
nstances set out in section 378 (3) (c) arose between the day of the judgment"
"and the last day of the lodging of an appeal. In the present Code of Civil"
