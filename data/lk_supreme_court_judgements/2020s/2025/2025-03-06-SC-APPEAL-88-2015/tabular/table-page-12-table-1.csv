"I
n Perera vs. Perera and another,5 the defendant being aggrieved by the final judgment of"
"the District Court, filed Notice of Appeal and subsequently the petition of appeal. After the"
"learned District Judge had accepted the petition of appeal the plaintiffs filed a motion giving"
"reasons why the petition of appeal should not have been accepted. The learned District Judge"
"inquired into this matter and made order rejecting the petition of appeal. One of the grounds"
"for the rejection of the petition of appeal was that it had been signed by an Attorney who was"
"not the  Registered Attorney  for the appellant  in that  case.  Thus, the question in that  case"
"before Court was whether an Attorney other than the Registered Attorney can sign the petition"
