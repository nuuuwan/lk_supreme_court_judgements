Counsel : Dr. Sunil Cooray for the Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellants.

S. A. D. S. Suraweera for the Defendant-Respondent-Respondents.

Argued on : 20-06-2024

Decided on : 06-03-2025

[SC Appeal 88/2015] - Page 10 of 18

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Plaintiffs or Plaintiff-

Appellants) instituted the action relevant to this appeal against the Defendant-Respondent-

Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Defendants or Defendant-

Respondents) seeking to partition the land referred to in the Plaint. The learned District Judge

after conclusion of the trial by his judgment dated 28-09-2006, decided to dismiss the

Plaintiffs action on the basis that the identity of the corpus has not been established.

Being aggrieved by the judgment dated 28-09-2006 pronounced by the District Court, the

plaintiff has preferred an appeal to the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. At the stage of

the argument of the said Appeal, the learned Counsel for the 12th and 13th Defendant-

Respondents has raised a preliminary objection on the validity and legitimacy of the Petition

of Appeal filed by the Plaintiffs. The said preliminary objection was raised on the basis that it

was not the Registered Attorney on record for the Plaintiff-Appellants who has signed the said

Petition of Appeal. There is no dispute that it is the Plaintiff-Appellants themselves who have

signed the said Petition of Appeal.

After conclusion of the argument, the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals by its judgment

dated 05-05-2014, has decided to uphold the aforesaid preliminary objection and dismiss the

Appeal of the Plaintiff-Appellants.

Being aggrieved by the judgment dated 05-05-2014 pronounced by the Provincial High Court

of Civil Appeals, the Plaintiff-Appellants have filed the Leave to Appeal Petition relevant to this

Appeal. Upon the said Leave to Appeal Petition being supported, this Court by its Order, dated

22-05-2015, has granted Leave to Appeal in respect of the questions of law set out in

paragraphs 12(a), 12(b), 12(c) and 12(d) of the Petition, dated 16-06-2014. The said

questions of law are as follows:

(a) Was Mr. Chandrika Weerasuriya Bandara, the registered Attorney-at-law of the 1st

and 2nd Plaintiff-Appellants from 09-10-2006, incapable of acting as such registered

Attorney-at-law, from and after 14-11-2006, at least until 15-01-2007, due to his

absence from Sri Lanka;

(b) Did the Plaintiff Appellants have no registered Attorney-at-law in this case from

14-11-2006 until the period of 60 days allowed by law for filing the Petition of

Appeal expired on or about 28-11-2006;

[SC Appeal 88/2015] - Page 11 of 18

(c) As the registered Attorney-at-law of the Plaintiff-Appellants had left the country

and had become incapable of acting as such for them, were the Plaintiff-Appellants

entitled in law to act in person and to sign their Petition of Appeal:

(d) Did it become impossible for Mr. Chandrika Weerasuriya Bandara, to sign the

Petition of Appeal of the 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Appellants once he left Sri Lanka and

so long as he remained away from Sri Lanka, and does the legal maxims, Lex non

cogit ad Impossibilia and Impotentia excusat legem have operation in the facts

and circumstances of this case;

In the course of the hearing, it was brought to the attention of Court that it was the Registered

Attorney for the Plaintiff-Appellants on record, Mr. Chandrika Weerasooriya Bandara who has

signed the Notice of Appeal dated 09-10-2006. However, while the said Registered Attorney

on record for the Plaintiff-Appellants has failed to sign the Petition of Appeal dated 24th

November 2006, it is the Plaintiff-Appellants themselves who have signed the said Petition of

Appeal. There is no dispute that it was Mr. Chandrika Weerasooriya Bandara who stood as

the Registered Attorney for the Plaintiff-Appellants on record during the time the Plaintiff-

Appellants had signed and filed the Petition of Appeal dated 24-11-2006.

The focus of the submissions of the counsel during the argument of this case, primarily

revolved around two sections: Section 27(2) and Section 755(3) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Let me at the outset reproduce them below.

S. 27(2) of the Civil Procedure Code is the section which deals with the duties of the instructing

Attorneys on record for the parties.

S. 27 (2) When so filed, it shall be in force until revoked with the leave of the

court and after notice to the registered attorney by a writing signed by the client and

filed in court, or until the client dies, or until the registered attorney dies, is removed,

or suspended, or otherwise becomes incapable to act, or until all proceedings in the

action are ended and judgment satisfied so far as regards the client.

S. 755(3) of the Civil Procedure Code deals with presenting a petition of appeal.

S. 755(3) Every appellant shall within sixty days from the date of the judgment or

decree appealed against present to the original court a petition of appeal setting out

the circumstances out of which the appeal arises and the grounds of objection to the

judgment or decree appealed against, and containing the particulars required by

[SC Appeal 88/2015] - Page 12 of 18

section 758, which shall be signed by the appellant or his registered attorney. Such

petition of appeal shall be exempt from stamp duty.

The learned Counsel for the Defendant-Respondent has relied on three cases:1 Perera vs.

Perera and another,2 Seelawathie and another vs. Jayasinghe,3 Manaperi Somawathie vs.

Buwaneswari.4

In Perera vs. Perera and another,5 the defendant being aggrieved by the final judgment of

the District Court, filed Notice of Appeal and subsequently the petition of appeal. After the

learned District Judge had accepted the petition of appeal the plaintiffs filed a motion giving

reasons why the petition of appeal should not have been accepted. The learned District Judge

inquired into this matter and made order rejecting the petition of appeal. One of the grounds

for the rejection of the petition of appeal was that it had been signed by an Attorney who was

not the Registered Attorney for the appellant in that case. Thus, the question in that case

before Court was whether an Attorney other than the Registered Attorney can sign the petition

of appeal. Soza J in that case relied on his previously pronounced judgment in Wickremasinghe

vs. Magilin Nona de Silva,6 which held as follows:

Subsection (3) of section 755 of the Civil Procedure Code which requires the

appellant to present to the original court a petition of appeal within sixty days is

couched in imperative terms. This is a new provision and is clearly mandatory.

The filing of the petition of appeal is an essential concomitant of the filing of the

notice of appeal. Both steps are mandatory and imperative steps in lodging an

appeal. Until these steps are taken as directed by the Civil Procedure Code the

Judge cannot comply with subsection (4) of section 755. The learned District

Judge was therefore right in rejecting the petition of appeal. The notice of appeal

too lapses for want of compliance with the subsequent requirements and should

now be rejected.7

1 Paragraph 22 of the written submissions filed with the Motion dated 01-02-2021. 2 [1981] 2 Sri LR 41. 3 [1985] 2 Sri LR 266. 4 [1990] 1 Sri LR 223. 5 [1981] 2 Sri LR 41. 6 [1978 -79] 2 Sri LR 65. 7 At page 70.

[SC Appeal 88/2015] - Page 13 of 18

However, it must be noted here that the issue whether the party itself can sign the Petition

of Appeal when there is a Registered Attorney for that party on record, did not arise in that

case for decision.

Let me now consider the second case relied on by the learned Counsel for the Defendant-

Respondent. i.e., the case of Seelawathie and another vs. Jayasinghe.8 The argument in that

case was that the Notice of Appeal was bad in law as it has been signed by the 4th and 6th

Defendant-Appellants in that case in person, despite the fact that there was a Registered

Attorney on record for them. The applicable provision in that case was section 323 (1) of the

Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1978 which is as follows:

"Every notice of appeal shall contain the particulars prescribed by rules of Court,

shall be signed by the appellant or his registered attorney.... ".

The learned Counsel who appeared for the appellant in Seelawathies case, sought to argue

that the plain meaning of the above phrase, particularly in view of the use of the word "or",

must be understood as either the appellant or his registered attorney can file the petition of

appeal. He further argued that the appellant in that case can sign and file a Petition of Appeal

even though he had a Registered Attorney in view of the above provision (i.e., Section 323

(1) of the Administration of Justice Law), and as such the Court should accept the Notice of

Appeal.

Seneviratne J (President Court of Appeal) (with Jameel J agreeing) having stated that the

provision in then existed Civil Procedure Code was similar to Section 323 (1) of the

Administration of Justice Law, proceeded to hold as follows:

There is an abundance of authority, I should say from time immemorial (1881)

up to day, which authorities have been referred to by learned President's

Counsel for the respondent which set out the principle that two attorneys (at

the time these cases were decided two proctors) cannot act for a party. This

principle has been reiterated in the case Silva v Cumaratunga. In this case the

petition of appeal was not signed by the proctor who was the proctor on the

record on the day the appeal was filed, on November 12th 1937. The facts show

that the proctor on record earlier had revoked his proxy on 15th November,

8 [1985] 2 Sri LR 266.

[SC Appeal 88/2015] - Page 14 of 18

1937, so that at the time the petition of appeal was filed the said proctor was

the proctor on record. As the petition of appeal was not signed by the proctor

on record on 12.11.37, the date on which the appeal was filed, the Supreme

Court rejected the petition of appeal. Maartensz, J. summed up the principle

decided in the previous cases as follows :

"The ratio decidendi in old cases, with which I respectfully agree was

that this Court cannot recognize two proctors appearing for the same

party in the same cause".

The learned President's Counsel for the respondent relying on the principle set

out above submitted that in the same manner a party and his attorney-at-law

on record cannot appear at the same time. The President's Counsel for the

appellant submitted that to introduce after the words "shall be signed by the

appellant", the words 'who has no attorney-at-law on record' would be contrary

to the plain understanding of the section.

I am of the view that section 323 (1) and the like sections in the present Code

should be interpreted firstly in relation to the principles set out by the long series

of authorities, and secondly in a manner not to cause disorder in Court

proceedings. Permitting either the appellant or the attorney-at-law to sign the

petition of appeal would mean that two parties are acting at the same time in

the course of the proceedings of a case. Further, permitting such a practice

would lead to disorder and confusion in Court proceedings. The words "shall be

signed by the appellant or his registered attorney" should be understood and

interpreted to mean that the petition of appeal can be signed by the appellant

when he has no registered attorney on record. Under the Administration of

Justice Law such a situation would have arisen under section 378 (3) of the

Administration of Justice (Amendment) Law No. 25 of 1975, if any one of the

instances set out in section 378 (3) (c) arose between the day of the judgment

and the last day of the lodging of an appeal. In the present Code of Civil

Procedure section 27 (2) is the like section.

Let me now turn to the judgment of H. W. Senanayake J in the case of Manaperi Somawathie

vs. Buwaneswari.9 The first Defendant-Appellant in that case being aggrieved by the judgment

of the District Judge who held in favour of the Plaintiff in that case, had tendered the Notice

9 [1990] 1 Sri LR 223.

[SC Appeal 88/2015] - Page 15 of 18

of Appeal on 28-05-1982 personally and also filed the Petition of Appeal dated 15-07-1982

signed by the first Defendant-Appellant in that case herself in spite of the fact that there was

a Registered Attorney for the first Defendant on record. In the course of the argument of the

appeal in that case, the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent advanced the argument

that the Notice of Appeal and the Petition of Appeal filed by the Defendant-Appellant in that

case should be rejected on the basis that there was a Registered Attorney on record for the

Defendant-Appellant as at that date. Having considered the respective positions put forward

by the parties, H. W. Senanayake J in that case proceeded to hold as follows:

In terms of the provisions of sections 754 (3) and 754 (4) of the Civil Procedure

Code, every Appeal to the Court of Appeal shall be lodged by giving notice of

appeal to the original Court and such notice of appeal shall be presented to the

Court of First Instance for this purpose by the party appellant or his registered

attorney.

Thereafter in terms of section 755(3) of the Civil Procedure Code every appellant

shall within 60 days present to the original Court a petition of Appeal which shall

be signed by the appellant or his registered - Attorney.

A superficial reading of the section may give one the impression that the notice

of appeal could be presented and signed by the party - appellant or his registered

Attorney. But a correct analysis of these sections shows that a party appellant

could present only a notice of appeal personally but he can sign the petition of

appeal only when there is no registered attorney of his on record at the relevant

time.

Registered attorney is defined in section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code, to mean

an attorney-at-law appointed by a party or his recognized agent to act on his

behalf.

A consideration of section 27 (1) shows that the appointment of a registered

attorney to make any appearance or application or to do any act as aforesaid

shall be in writing signed by the client and shall be filed in Court; when filed it

shall be in force until revoked with leave of the Court, after notice to the

registered attorney by a writing signed by the party and filed in Court. The proxy

[SC Appeal 88/2015] - Page 16 of 18

so filed is binding on the party until the party dies or until all proceedings in the

action are ended and judgment satisfied so far as regards the party.

The inactive position of the party is finally demonstrated by section 28 of the

Code which states that if any such registered attorney dies or becomes incapable

to act any time before judgment no further proceedings shall be taken in the

action against the party for whom he appeared until 30 days after notice to

appoint another registered attorney has been given to the party either personally

or in such other manner as the Court directs. It is therefore clear from these

provisions of the Code, that once a registered attorney is on record the party

could necessarily act only though the registered attorney.

Let me now refer to the judgment relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Defendant-

Respondent. That is the Court of Appeal judgment in CA Appeal No: 627/84.10 In that case, a

preliminary objection was taken up before the Court of Appeal that the Petition of Appeal has

not been signed by the Registered Attorney but by the Appellant herself. Edussuriya J (Ananda

Coomaraswamy J agreeing) in that case, held as follows:

This is an appeal from a judgement of the District Judge of Mount Lavinia

dated 01.11.84 dismissing the plaintiffs action and holding the defendant to be

a tenant. Preliminary objection was taken on 08.7.92 before us that the petition

of appeal has not been signed by the registered Attorney-at-Law but by the

appellant herself. The appellant has filed an affidavit stating that she could not

get the signature of the registered Attorney-at-Law as he was seriously ill. She

has also filed an affidavit of the present registered Attorney-at-Law who is in

fact the son of the former registered Attorney-at-Law who was ill and died

subsequently, and also an affidavit of one Attorney-at-Law Mr. Soysa stating

that when the appellant sought his advice, he advised her to sign the petition

of appeal as it was not possible to get the signature of the registered attorney-

at-Law, who was seriously ill and who died subsequently.

10 Decided on: 15-10-1992.

[SC Appeal 88/2015] - Page 17 of 18

In view of these circumstances we see nothing wrong in the appellant herself

signing the petition of appeal in terms of section 755 of the Civil Procedure

Code.

For these reasons we dismiss the preliminary objection.

Thus, having regard to the facts of that case, it appears to me that Their Lordships had gone

on the basis that the Registered Attorney in that case at the relevant time had become

incapable to act as he was seriously ill. Their Lordships in that case appear to have taken the

view that the subsequent passing away of the said Registered Attorney had confirmed the

incapability of the relevant Registered Attorney to act on behalf of the relevant party in that

case. Be that as it may, it would suffice, for me to state here that Their Lordships had taken

that decision on the facts relevant to that case.

Having regard to the several authorities cited above, I too take the view that it would not be

in the best interest of the system of administration of justice in this country to permit two

parties to act at the same time in the course of the proceedings of a case as such a practice

would lead to disorder and confusion in Court proceedings. Thus, I am also of the view that

the phrase "shall be signed by the appellant or his registered attorney" in Section 755(3) of

the Civil Procedure Code should be understood and interpreted to mean that the Petition of

Appeal can be signed by the Appellant only when he has no Registered Attorney on record

within the meaning of Section 27(2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

In the instant case, as I have mentioned at the commencement of this judgment, Mr.

Chandrika Weerasooriya Bandara stood as the Registered Attorney for the Plaintiff-Appellants

on record during the time the Plaintiff-Appellants had signed and filed the Petition of Appeal

dated 24-11-2006. It appears that the affidavit dated 22-04-2014 affirmed by Mr. Chandrika

Weerasooriya Bandara who stood as the Registered Attorney for the Plaintiff-Appellants has

been produced with the written submissions dated 24-04-2014 which was filed by the Plaintiff-

Appellants on the preliminary objection raised against the maintainability of the Appeal before

the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. Therefore, it is clear that Mr. Chandrika

Weerasooriya Bandara who stood as the Registered Attorney for the Plaintiff-Appellants had

chosen to submit his affidavit dated 22-04-2014 after the Defendant-Respondent had raised

the afore-said preliminary objection. Thus, it was at a very late stage that the Registered

Attorney for the Plaintiff-Appellants had taken up some position claiming that he was incapable

[SC Appeal 88/2015] - Page 18 of 18

of acting as the Registered Attorney as he was overseas at the time the Plaintiff-Appellants

had signed and filed the Petition of Appeal dated 24-11-2006.

The Registered Attorney for the Plaintiff-Appellants had chosen to go overseas few days before

the final date for filing the Petition of Appeal. Yet, if he was still interested and vigilant, there

was nothing to prevent him taking all available steps to ensure the filing of the Petition of

Appeal within the parameters provided by law. Travelling overseas temporarily, is not similar

to situations such as death, removal or suspension from practice. Hence, I am unable to

accept that the said Registered Attorney had become incapable of acting as the Registered

Attorney for the Plaintiff-Appellants by the mere fact that he was temporarily overseas. Thus,

I am unable to hold that the Registered Attorney for the 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Appellants had

become incapable of acting during the period relevant to the issue in this case. For the

foregoing reasons, I answer all four questions of law in respect of which this Court has granted

Leave to Appeal in the negative. I therefore proceed to dismiss this Appeal with costs.
