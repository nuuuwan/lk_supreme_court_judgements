"Grade II after obtaining the approval of the University Grants Commission which"
"is the 27th respondent. The letter has been marked as P8."
"Therefore, the petitioner states that although he assumed duties in the capacity"
"of Lecturer (Probationary) on 06.04.2009 he had reasonable expectations to be"
"upgraded to the post of Senior Lecturer Grade II which was the post which had"
"been advertised. He further says that although P8 indicated to him that he would"
"be  considered  to  the  Senior  Lecturer  Grade  II  in  due  course,  1st  to  the  27th"
"respondents  have  failed  to  do  so,  despite  many  reminders  by  him,  which  had"
"been marked and produced as part and parcel of the petition."
