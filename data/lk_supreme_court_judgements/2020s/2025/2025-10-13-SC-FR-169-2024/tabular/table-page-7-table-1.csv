"The phrase ""equality before the law"" appears in nearly all written constitutions"
"and  is  derived  from  English  law.  In  contrast,  the  term  ""equal  protection  of  the"
"law""  first  appeared  in  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the"
"United States. Both expressions are employed in the Constitution of Sri Lanka,"
"as they are in the Indian Constitution."
"Article 14 of the Indian Constitution provides: ""The State shall not deny to any"
"person  equality  before  the  law  or  the  equal  protection  of  the  laws  within  the"
"territory  of  India.""  It  is  important  to  observe  that,  in  the  Indian  context,  this"
"prohibition  against  inequality  applies  solely  to  the  State.  However,  no  such"
"limitation exists under the Sri Lankan Constitution."
"Both  terms  â€œequality  before  the  law""  and  ""equal  protection  of  the  law""  are  also"
"found in Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:"
"""All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal"
"protection of the law."" Similarly, Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil"
"and Political Rights contains both expressions."
"The notion of equality before the law is regarded as a negative concept, denoting"
"the absence of special privileges for any individual and the equal subjection of"
"all persons to the ordinary law. On the other hand, equal protection of the law is"
"considered  a  more  affirmative  concept,  connoting  the  equal  application  of  the"
"law in similar circumstances."
"Jennings  viewed  equal  treatment  as  encompassed  within  the  idea  of  equality"
"before  the  law,  stating:  ""Equality before the law means that  among equals, the"
"law  should  be  equal  and  should  be  equally  administered,  that  like  should  be"
"treated alike.""  The underlying aim of both expressions is clearly the attainment"
"of equal justice."
"Dicey, asserting equality before the law to be a corollary of the famous doctrine"
"of the rule of law, emphasised that it means,"
