"violation relating to an infringement or imminent infringement irrespective of"
"the  fact  that  the  said  violation  is  in  relation  to  a  decision  of  an  academic"
"establishment.”"
"The  petitioner  in  this  case  does  not  seek  to  challenge  a  subjective  academic"
"evaluation,  such  as  a  mark  or  grade,  but  rather  contests 
the failure  of"
"administrative  authorities  to  act  on  binding  internal  recommendations  and  a"
"statutory  appellate  body’s  directive,  despite  the  evident error 
in  his 
initial"
"appointment  process.  This 
is  not  an  academic 
judgment,  but  a  matter"
"of compliance with lawful administrative procedure."
"The  Respondents  contend  that  under  UGC  Circular  721  and  Establishment"
"Circular  17/2005,  the  Petitioner  was  not  eligible  for  appointment  as  Senior"
"Lecturer Grade II or as an Associate Professor, as he had not obtained a First or"
"Second Class in his basic degree, failed to produce his BSc certificate at the time"
"of application, and had not completed a PhD until 2017, thereby qualifying only"
"for  Lecturer 
(Probationary).  They  argue 
further  that  his  acceptance  of  the"
"probationary appointment without protest, reliance on a disputed document (P-"
"08), delay of fifteen years in filing the petition, suppression of material facts, and"
"non-joinder of necessary parties render the application misconceived and time-"
"barred."
"In contrast, the Petitioner asserts that his B.Sc. (Special) in Chemistry together"
"with an M.Phil in Chemical Sciences satisfied the criteria under Circular 721 for"
"appointment  as  Senior  Lecturer  Grade 
II,  and 
that 
the  University  acted"
"arbitrarily in seeking approval only for the probationary post, despite assurances"
"of later upgrading. He highlights that in 2017, a university sub-committee and"
"subsequently the Council confirmed his eligibility, but the Acting Vice Chancellor"
"failed  to  forward  this  to  the  UGC,  and  that  the  USAB,  after  hearing  both  the"
"University and the UGC, ordered his appointment as Senior Lecturer Grade II"
"with effect from 2009, an order never implemented."
"While  the  Respondents  stress  technical  ineligibility  and  procedural  bars,  the"
"Petitioner emphasizes the arbitrariness, contradictory positions of the UGC."
"Article 12(1) of the Constitution guarantees that ""All persons are equal before"
"the law and are entitled to the equal protection of the law."""
