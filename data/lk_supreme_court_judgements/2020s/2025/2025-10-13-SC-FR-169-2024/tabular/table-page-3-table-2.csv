"respondents  have  failed  to  do  so,  despite  many  reminders  by  him,  which  had"
"been marked and produced as part and parcel of the petition."
"Paul Craig on ‘Administrative Law’ (6th Edition) at page 686:"
"“The concept of legitimate expectations should play the same general rule"
"in this type of cases, as in relation to intra vires representations. It is a"
"necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the representation to bind the"
"public  body.  Reasonableness  of  reliance  is  a  necessary  condition  for  a"
"legitimate expectation. It might be objected that a representee could never"
"have a “legitimate” expectation if the representation was ultra vires. This"
"is,  however,  merely  a  restatement  of  the  general  rule  that  ultra  vires"
"representations cannot ever bind, which is the very question in issue.”"
