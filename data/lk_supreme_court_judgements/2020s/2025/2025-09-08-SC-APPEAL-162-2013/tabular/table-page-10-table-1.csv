"Therefore, I do not find merit in the argument that there was no basis for the"
"Competent Authority to form an opinion that the land in question was State"
"land."
"It is my view that once a land is vested with the Land Reform Commission by"
"the operation of law, anyone other than a statutory lessee in terms of the law"
"can be considered as a person holding the land without authorization for the"
"purposes  of  the  implementation  of  the  provisions  of  the  Land  Reform  Law."
"Hence, I am of the view that the respondent-respondents were well within the"
"law when the Competent Authority issued the contended quit notices against"
"the appellants."
"It is quite clear from the material placed before the Court that when the Writ"
"Application preferred by the appellants was taken into consideration, it had"
"been revealed as to a dispute in relation to the statutory lessee of the property."
"The actual statutory lessee, in his statutory declaration itself, has stated that"
"he has already sold the land to one Jayawardena and Wanigaratne, although"
"he has not executed a deed of transfer. The said persons have also submitted"
"statutory declarations to the Land Reform Commission claiming them to be"
"the statutory lessees of the land."
"As correctly observed in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the occupiers of"
"the  land  have  obstructed  the  Land  Reform  Commission  from  carrying  out"
"their  legitimate  duties  by  objecting  to  a  land  survey  being  conducted  in"
"relation to the property."
"The Court of Appeal has also correctly observed that the deed of declaration"
"upon which the appellants had claimed title is a self-serving document, and"
"the District Court judgement produced before the Court to claim title was a"
"judgment obtained without the necessary parties being named. It is also clear"
"that the earlier mentioned Wanigaratne has also disputed the claims by the"
"appellants as to the title in relation to the land in question."
"It was under these circumstances the Court of Appeal has come to a finding"
"that  the  land  where  the  appellants,  as petitioners  of  the  action,  have  come"
"before the Court of Appeal seeking a Writ, is a matter based on disputed facts."
