Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The petitioner-appellants (hereinafter referred to as the appellants) initiated

proceedings before the Court of Appeal seeking a Writ in the nature of a Writ

of Certiorari in order to quash the notices to quit dated 13-01-2005, issued

by the 2nd respondent-respondent on the appellants in terms of State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 07 of 1979 as amended.

The Court of Appeal of the judgment dated 27-06-2013 dismissed the said

application with costs on the basis that it finds no merit in the application.

Being aggrieved of the said decision, the appellants preferred an application

for Special Leave to Appeal, and having considered the said application, this

Court granted Leave to Appeal on 18-11-2013 in respect of questions of law

set out in paragraph 11 subparagraph (a) to (f) of the petition dated 08-07-

2013.

Page 5 of 14

The said questions of law upon which Leave to Appeal was allowed read as

follows,

a. Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that the petitioner-petitioners

were in unauthorized occupation of the said land when the 1st

respondent-respondents had accepted the title of the 2nd petitioner-

petitioners as a statutory lessee of 50 acres and co-owner of the

balance.

b. Has the Court of Appeal erred by determining matters which were

not in issue and taking into account irrelevant circumstances.

c. Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that a course could be had to

the provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possessions) Act in

instances where there is serious title dispute.

d. Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to take cognizance of the fact

that there was no material of which the 2nd respondent-respondents

could have formed the opinion that the corpus to which the notices

relate is State land as contemplated by the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act as such the notices were ultra vires the said act.

e. Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to take cognizance of the fact

that there was inconsistency on the part of the 1st respondent-

respondents for the reason that in the previous Writ Application

bearing No. CA 366/91 the 2nd respondent-respondents had

categorically stated that the corpus was not State land, and in the

present application bearing the LRC has taken an opposite position

that the land is vested in the LRC.

f. Did the Court of Appeal err in failing to take cognizance of the fact

that there was no material on which the 2nd respondent-respondents

could have formed the opinion that the petitioners were in

unauthorized occupation of such land, as contemplated by section

3 of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act as amended by Act

No. 29 of 1983, which is the subject matter of this application.

Page 6 of 14

This is a matter where the 2nd respondent-respondents, namely, the

Chairman of the Land Reforms Commission, being a Competent Authority in

terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possessions) Act, have

issued quit notices dated 13-01-2005. In the said quit notices which have

been marked as P-11, P-12, and P-13 before the Court of Appeal, the

Competent Authority has expressed the opinion that the land morefully

described in the schedule of the said quit notices is a State land, and that the

appellants are in unauthorized occupation of the same, requiring them to

vacate the said land.

It is against the said quit notices that the appellants have gone before the

Court of Appeal seeking a Writ in the nature of Certiorari and other incidental

reliefs.

The Court of Appeal, after considering the positions taken up on behalf of the

appellants to argue that the Competent Authority had no basis to come to an

opinion that the land in question is a State land, and the appellants are the

owners of the land, and also having referred to other factual matters, had

decided by the judgment dated 27-06-2013 to dismiss the application.

It has been observed that the petitioners do not have a basis to claim

ownership as they claim, and the question of alleged ownership is in dispute;

hence, the Court will not exercise Writ jurisdiction based on disputed facts. It

has been observed further, that this is a matter where the appellants should

obtain remedy by pursuing their rights in a competent Court and not by

invoking the Writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

At the hearing of this appeal, this Court heard the submissions of the learned

Presidents Counsel who represented the appellants, also had the benefit of

listening to the submissions of the learned Counsel who represented the

respondent-respondents as to their respective stands.

Having considered the arguments placed before the Court and the relevant

documents submitted in support of the arguments, I find the following as the

relevant facts that need to be considered.

Page 7 of 14

The questioned land for which the Chairman of the Land Reforms Commission

issued quit notices is a land called Allington Estate situated at Rakwana,

containing about 290 acres in extent.

The appellants have claimed co-ownership to the said land based on a deed

of declaration and a District Court judgment which was in their favor, where

it has been declared that the land mentioned in the schedule of the said plaint

is owned by the plaintiffs by possession.

The appellants have claimed rights to the land in question on the basis that

the original owner of the land sold it to them, although no deed of formal

transfer has been executed.

They appear to have relied on the statutory declaration made by the said

original owner of the land who has the paper title in terms of section 18 of the

Land Reform Law No. 01 of 1972, where the said original owner of the land,

namely, one A.M. Ismail had declared in the statutory declaration sent to the

Land Reforms Commission in terms of the above section 18 declaration that

he sold the property to one W.S.S. Jayawardena and Don William

Wanigaratne on 25-05-1966, but did not execute the deed of transfer as a

balance sum of Rs. 17, 500/- is still due to him. (the document marked R-01

before the Court of Appeal).

The documents marked R-02 and R-03 before the Court of Appeal which are

also statutory declarations in terms of Land Reform Law by the mentioned

Don William Wanigaratne and W.S.S. Jayawardena respectively, show that

they have also claimed rights to the property.

The document marked P-01, which is the decree entered in the District Court

of Ratnapura case No. 9152/L reveals that it was an action instituted without

the Land Reforms Commission or the earlier mentioned Wanigaratne or the

original owner Ismail being made parties. It is a judgment where only a

declaration has been given, stating that the plaintiffs in the action are entitle

for possessory ownership.

Page 8 of 14

The documents marked P-01A, is a deed of declaration prepared among the

parties to the deed to claim rights to the land where the quit notices have been

issued by the Land Reforms Commission.

Having considered the factual matrix as above, I will now proceed to consider

whether the appellants being the petitioners before the Court of Appeal had

established a basis upon which the Court could have issued a Writ in the

nature of a Writ of Certiorari as sought by them.

Since it was the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel that there was

no basis for the 2nd respondent to issue a quit notice in terms of section 03 of

the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act, and there was no basis for him

to form an opinion that the land mentioned in the schedule of the quit notice

is a State land, I will now proceed to consider the said argument.

There cannot be any argument that the 2nd respondent-respondents named

in this appeal, being the Chairman of the 1st respondent-respondent, the Land

Reforms Commission, is a person statutorily authorized to function as a

Competent Authority in terms of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act

No. 07 of 1979 (The Act).

Section 3 of the Act provides for a notice to be issued to a party in

unauthorized possession or occupation of State land.

The relevant section 3(1) of the Act reads as follows,

3(1). Where a competent authority is of the opinion

a. That the land is state land; and

b. That any person is in unauthorized possession or

occupation of such land, the competent authority

may serve a notice on such person in possession or

occupation thereof, or where the competent

authority considers such service in practicable or

inexpedient, exhibit such notice in a conspicuous

place in or upon that land requiring such person to

vacate such land with his dependence, if any, and to

Page 9 of 14

deliver vacant possession of such land to such

competent authority or other authorized person as

maybe specified in the notice on or before a

specified date. The date to be specified in such

notice shall be a date not less than 30 days from the

date of the issue or the exhibition of such notice.

Section 3(1) of the Land Reform Law, provides for ceiling on holding

agricultural land a person can own. If the land consists exclusively of paddy

land, it would be 25 acres, or if such land does not consist exclusively of paddy

land, it would be 50 acres.

If a person owned more than the above ceiling at the commencement of the

law, namely, 26-08-1972, any agricultural land in excess would be deemed to

be vested in the Land Reforms Commission.

The relevant section 3(2) of the Land Reform Law reads as follows,

3(2). Any agricultural land owned by any person in excess of the

ceiling on the date of the commencement of this law shall as from

that date

a. Be deemed to vest in the Commission, and

b. Be deemed to be held by such person under a statutory

lease from the Commission.

It was undisputed that one A.M. Ismail of No. 85, Rosmead Place, Colombo

07 was the owner of the land mentioned in the schedule of the quit notice

when he submitted the statutory declaration, which needs to be submitted by

a statutory lessee once the excess land is vested with the Commission in terms

of section 18 of the Act.

Although he has claimed that he sold the land to W.S.S. Jayawardena and

Don William Wanigaratne, in view of the absence of any deed of transfer, for

all intended purposes, it would be the said Ismail that will have to be

considered as the statutory lessee in terms of section 18.

Page 10 of 14

Therefore, I do not find merit in the argument that there was no basis for the

Competent Authority to form an opinion that the land in question was State

land.

It is my view that once a land is vested with the Land Reform Commission by

the operation of law, anyone other than a statutory lessee in terms of the law

can be considered as a person holding the land without authorization for the

purposes of the implementation of the provisions of the Land Reform Law.

Hence, I am of the view that the respondent-respondents were well within the

law when the Competent Authority issued the contended quit notices against

the appellants.

It is quite clear from the material placed before the Court that when the Writ

Application preferred by the appellants was taken into consideration, it had

been revealed as to a dispute in relation to the statutory lessee of the property.

The actual statutory lessee, in his statutory declaration itself, has stated that

he has already sold the land to one Jayawardena and Wanigaratne, although

he has not executed a deed of transfer. The said persons have also submitted

statutory declarations to the Land Reform Commission claiming them to be

the statutory lessees of the land.

As correctly observed in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, the occupiers of

the land have obstructed the Land Reform Commission from carrying out

their legitimate duties by objecting to a land survey being conducted in

relation to the property.

The Court of Appeal has also correctly observed that the deed of declaration

upon which the appellants had claimed title is a self-serving document, and

the District Court judgement produced before the Court to claim title was a

judgment obtained without the necessary parties being named. It is also clear

that the earlier mentioned Wanigaratne has also disputed the claims by the

appellants as to the title in relation to the land in question.

It was under these circumstances the Court of Appeal has come to a finding

that the land where the appellants, as petitioners of the action, have come

before the Court of Appeal seeking a Writ, is a matter based on disputed facts.

Page 11 of 14

It has been determined that the alleged title as claimed was doubtful and was

based on documents that are incomplete, lacking in authority, and self-

serving. Therefore, the review procedure would not be well suited for the

determination of disputed facts.

In the case of Thajudeen Vs. Sri Lanka Tea Board and Another 1981 2 SLR

471 it was held that; where the major facts are in dispute, and the legal

results of the facts are subject to controversy, it is necessary that the said

questions should be canvased in a suit where parties would have ample

opportunity of examining the witnesses so that Court would be better able to

judge which version is correct, a Writ will not issue.

Ranasinghe, J. cited CHOUDRI in his book on the Law of Writs and

Fundamental Rights (2nd Ed.) Vol. 02, at page 381:

The rule has been stated that mandamus will not lie to compel a public

officer to perform a duty dependent upon disputed and doubtful facts, or

where the legal result of the facts is subject to controversy. If the right is

in serious doubt the discretionary power rests with the officer to decide

whether or not he will enforce it, till the right shall have been established

in some proper action, and discretion fairly exercised in such

circumstances cannot be controlled by mandamus,

Held further at page 449:

Where facts are in dispute and in order to get at the truth it is necessary

that the questions should be canvased in a suit where parties would have

ample opportunity of examining their witnesses and the Court would be

able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue.

In the Indian Supreme Court case of D. Parraju Vs. General Manager, B.N.

Railway and Others AIR 1952 CAL 610 it was stated,

It also appears to me that in the facts of this case the remedy by way of

a suit is more convenient and effective. As I have stated the parties are

in dispute on several questions, namely, the authority by which the

petitioner was appointed, the natures on inquiry if any made in the

Page 12 of 14

present case, the denial of a right of appeal, the alleged imperfect nature

of the inquiry and the alleged arbitrary conduct of certain offices of the

railway administration. It is difficult in my opinion, to arrive at a

satisfactory conclusion on these matters on mere affidavits. In order to

get at truth, it is necessary that the questions referred to above should

be canvased in a suit where the parties would have ample opportunity of

examining their witnesses and the Court would be better able to judge

which version is correct.

In the case of Aselro Financial Services (Private) Limited Vs. M.A.

Wasantha Chandrasiri and Others CA/Application No. 797/2007

Per Sriskandrajah, J.

On careful consideration of the facts placed by both parties, now

the issued before this Court is to decide whether Kanibi Kotuwe

Kumbura is situated within the land called Polkotuwewatta

Deniya or not. This factual position falls within the ambit of Court

of first instance to decide after an inquiry or trial. In such an inquiry

or trial, the petitioner will also get an equal opportunity to contest

the trial. As factual matters are in issue this application is not

amendable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court.

I find that the appellants have gone before the Court of Appeal claiming co-

ownership of the land, and their plea for a Writ of Certiorari had been based

on very much disputed facts as contemplated above.

Hence, I do not find any reason to disagree with His Lordship Justice of the

Court of Appeal on his refusal to issue the Writ as sought for the reasons

stated in the judgement.

As considered in the said judgment, once a Competent Authority forms the

opinion that the land in question is a State land, and decides to issue a quit

notice under section 3 of the Act, the purpose of issuing such a notice is to

obtain the possession of the State land without any delay.

Page 13 of 14

Once an occupier issued with a notice is allowed to show cause as to why an

application made under the Act should not be allowed, a scope of an inquiry

that can be held has been defined in section 9 of the Act. In such an inquiry,

it is up to the person who is in occupation of the State land to establish that

he is in such possession or occupation upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the State, granted in accordance with any written law and such

permit or authority is in force.

In the case of Muhandiram Vs. Chairman, No. 111, Janatha Estate

Development Board (within 1992) 1 SLR 110 it was held that in an inquiry

under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, the onus is on the person

summoned to establish his possession or occupation that he is in possession

or occupation upon a valid permit or under written authority of the State,

granted according to any written law. If this burden is not discharged, the

only option open to the Magistrate is to order ejectment.

Besides that, in terms of section 12 of the Act, a statutory provision has been

laid down, where a person who has been ejected from a land under the

provisions of the Act or any person claimed to be the owner of the land thereof

is to institute an action against the State for compensation for the loss of his

rights.

In the case of Farook Vs. Gunawardena, Government Agent Ampara (1980)

2 SLR 243, which was a case relating to a State land recovery of possession

action, it was held,

The structure of the Act would also make it appear that where the

competent authority had formed the opinion that any land is State land,

even the Magistrate is not competent to question his opinion. Alternate

relief is given by section 12 which empowers any person claiming to be

the owner of a land to institute action against the State for the vindication

of his title within 6 months from the date of the order of ejectment and

section 13 is to the effect that where action is instituted by a person, if a

decision is made in favor of that person, he will be entitled to recover

Page 14 of 14

reasonable compensation for the damage sustained by reason of his

having been compelled to deliver possession of such land.

It is my considered view that the appellants who are seeking to claim

ownership of the land have the option of going before a competent Court,

where the said Court could have gone into their claim of ownership, and the

claim of the State in terms of the Land Reform Law in deciding the matter.

Apart from the above remedy, the petitioners will also have the remedy of filing

action against the State in terms of section 12 of the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act even if they were ejected from the land.

For the reasons as considered as above, I am of the view that there needs no

disturbance of the judgment pronounced by the Court of Appeal in this

regard.

Accordingly, I answer all the questions of law in the negative.

The appeal is dismissed as I find no merit in the same.

The appellants shall pay Rs. 50,000/- as costs to the respondent-

respondents.
