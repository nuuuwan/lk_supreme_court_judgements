"Court are in fact satisfactory to establish the claim of prescriptive title"
"of the Appellant."
"20. 
The  facts  prima  facie  compel  a  discussion  on  the  question  of"
"whether the defendant in a case of prescription of land could claim"
"possession by relying on the period of possession by a predecessor. In"
"this regard, reading into Section 3 of the Ordinance, it is apparent"
"that  such  is  legitimate  as  it  requires  proof  “of  the  undisturbed  and"
"uninterrupted possession by a defendant in any action,  or  by  those"
"under whom he claims” (emphasis mine). The same was affirmed in"
"the  case  Wijesundera  and  Others  v.  Constantine  Dasa  and"
"Another [1987] 2 SLR 66. Therefore, I hold that the Appellant of the"
"instant case can rely on the period of 17 years from 1974 – 1990 his"
"predecessor  E.R.  Gunawathie  claims  to  have  possessed  the  land  in"
"question 
to 
claim 
prescription."
"21. 
Having  established 
that  prescriptive 
title  could  be  claimed"
"through  the  possession  of  the  land  or  immovable  property  by  a"
"predecessor, I will now consider whether the occupation of the land"
"by  E.R.  Gunawathie  fulfils  the  requirements  of  “possession”  for  the"
"purposes  of  the  Section  3  of  the  Prescription  Ordinance  of  1871"
"(as amended)."
