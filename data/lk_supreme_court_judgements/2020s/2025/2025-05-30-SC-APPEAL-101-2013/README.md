Decided on : 30.05.2025 K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J

1. The Defendant-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant), appealed to this Court seeking to, inter alia, set aside the

judgment dated 21.03.2013 of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal holden in Mount Lavinia and the judgment dated 18.08.2006

of the District Court of Mount Lavinia.

Facts in Brief

2. The land in issue is described in the 2nd schedule to the plaint. There

is no dispute among the parties that the corpus is depicted as lot “A1”

in plan no. 10836 prepared by licensed surveyor J. Jayawickrema.

3. The Appellant has submitted that the dispute he had with regard to

possession of the land with the Plaintiff – Respondent- Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) was referred to the Primary

Court by the Mirihana Police in terms of Section 66 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979. The Magistrate Court of

Gangodawila ordered the parties involved to resolve the dispute

instituting a civil action in the District Court.

4. In the action in District Court of Mount Lavinia bearing no.

1308/00/L, the Respondent sought for a declaration of title in respect

of the said land, to remove the Appellant and all his agents from the

said land, and, requested that an interim injunction be issued against

the Appellant and his agents pertaining to the building and the well

being constructed in the said property. The Respondent further

requested that an enjoining order be issued regarding the same

4

against the Appellant. Title by prescription, although not prayed for,

was also claimed by the Respondent in his plaint.

5. The Appellant in his answer denied both the paper title and

prescriptive title claimed by the Respondent and stated that the

Appellant has both paper title and prescriptive title to the land in

question. He stated that the well “in construction” was in fact

constructed back in time and that there was a hut in the property as

well. He further denied that there was a building in construction in

the land. He stated that assessment tax in respect of the land was

paid by the Appellant and his predecessors and document proof for

such was presented to the Court. The Appellant therefore sought for

a declaration of title and the dismissal of the plaint.

6. The learned District Judge, by judgment dated 18.08.2006, held in

favour of the Respondent holding that the Respondent has proved his

title. Further, the learned District Court Judge granted an enjoining

order which, however, following tendering the objections of the

Appellant, was vacated, and the interim injunction was dismissed.

The learned District Judge upon addressing the question of

prescription held that the Appellant was unable to prove prescriptive

title to the land as there was no sufficient evidence to prove such.

7. Aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned District Court Judge,

the Appellant of the instant case preferred an appeal to the High Court

of Civil Appeal of Colombo Holden at Mount Lavinia to set aside the

judgment of the District Court dated 18.08.2006. The learned Judges

of the High Court dismissed the appeal and held in favour of the

Respondent.

8. Being aggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the Appellant

preferred the instant appeal to this Court. This Court granted leave to

5

appeal on the question of law set out in subparagraph (a) of paragraph

24 of the petition dated 02.05.2012.

Question of Law

24 (a) In the circumstances pleaded has the defendant proved his

prescriptive rights before the Court?

9. The principal legal instrument governing the area of prescription is

the Prescription Ordinance of 1871 (as amended), of which Section

3 provides as follows:

“ Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a

defendant in any action, or by those under whom he claims, of

lands or immovable property, by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in such action (that

is to say, a possession unaccompanied by payment of rent or

produce, or performance of service or duty, or by any other act by

the possessor, from which an acknowledgment of a right existing

in another person would fairly and naturally be inferred) for ten

years previous to the bringing of such action, shall entitle the

defendant to a decree in his favour with costs...”

(emphasis mine)

10. The burden of proof in a case of prescriptive title falls on the party

who claims prescriptive title as per Gratiaen J. in Chelliah v.

Wijenathan [1951] 54 NLR 337 at 342:

“…Where a party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an

adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests

6

fairly and squarely on him to establish a starting point for his or

her acquisition of prescriptive rights….”

11. In light of the above, I will take into account the following

positions furthered by the Appellant by way of the arguments placed

before this Court to determine if title by prescription has been

successfully established.

12. The principal premise of the Appellant’s case is the occupation of

his predecessor E.R. Gunawathie in the corpus from 1974 – 1990,

prior to the occupation of the Appellant. To substantiate this position,

the Appellant has furthered both documentary and oral evidence. In

terms of documentary evidence, the extracts from the Electoral

Register from 1985 – 1990 were provided marked “V17A” to “V17F”

(pages 450 – 455 of the brief). Further, the document marked “V10”

notes E.R. Gunawathie as the previous assessment taxpayer

concerning this property (page 410 of the brief). The Appellant has

also presented proof of their assessment tax payment for the years

1899 – 2000 by documents marked “V 7 A -D” (pages 400 – 403 of the

brief)

13. In terms of oral evidence, at the District Court trial, E.R.

Gunawathie has admitted to physically possessing the property in

question from the years 1974 – 1990. "1974 - 1990 ෙවනක% ෙමම ඉඩෙ*

ෙ+පල මම ./0 1%දා. ෙපා5 6වස/ ඇ9ලත ප;ං= ෙවලා >?යා" . (Vide page 245

of the brief).

14. She further testified that her possession was uninterrupted.

“ඇB1% ෙහD ෙවන ය* තැනැFෙත/ ෙමම ඉඩමට ආරJK කෙK නැහැ. L 8 M දැ/ෙවන

" (Page 247 of the brief).

7

15. She has testified that she paid assessment tax to the Municipal

Council of Maharagama for four years and further, that she acted in

the capacity of the owner in selling the land marked as “A1” in 1980

by deed bearing no. 4278 marked “V14 b”. The land has been

transferred back to her in the year 1981 through a deed bearing no.

4761 (marked “V15”). In 1990, she submitted that she sold the land

to the Appellant of the instant case through a deed bearing no. 1556

(marked “V9” at page 406 of the brief). (vide pages 245, 246 of the

brief).

16. The learned counsel for the Appellant, at the hearing of the case

further submitted that the oral evidence of E.R. Gunawathie was never

contested by the Respondents. Further, that the learned District

Court Judge did not appraise the aforementioned oral evidence in

coming to his decision relying solely on the documents whereby

contending that such alone is insufficient to establish possession.

17. In response to the above averments, the Respondents furthered

two positions primarily. First, concerning the oral evidence, the

learned counsel submitted that, the mere statements of possession

are not sufficient to establish title by prescription. The judgment of

Sirajudeen and Others v. Abbas [1994] 2 SLR 365 was cited in this

regard.

18. Second, in response to the documentary evidence, it was the

position of the Respondents that the payment of rates on its own does

not substantiate a claim of possession in a claim of prescriptive title.

The judgment of Hassan v. Romanishamy 66 CLW 112 was cited in

support.

19. In these circumstances, I will first consider the legal position on

this area to then consider whether the evidence placed before the

8

Court are in fact satisfactory to establish the claim of prescriptive title

of the Appellant.

20. The facts prima facie compel a discussion on the question of

whether the defendant in a case of prescription of land could claim

possession by relying on the period of possession by a predecessor. In

this regard, reading into Section 3 of the Ordinance, it is apparent

that such is legitimate as it requires proof “of the undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession by a defendant in any action, or by those

under whom he claims” (emphasis mine). The same was affirmed in

the case Wijesundera and Others v. Constantine Dasa and

Another [1987] 2 SLR 66. Therefore, I hold that the Appellant of the

instant case can rely on the period of 17 years from 1974 – 1990 his

predecessor E.R. Gunawathie claims to have possessed the land in

question to claim prescription.

21. Having established that prescriptive title could be claimed

through the possession of the land or immovable property by a

predecessor, I will now consider whether the occupation of the land

by E.R. Gunawathie fulfils the requirements of “possession” for the

purposes of the Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance of 1871

(as amended).

22. In the same judgment Sirajudeen and Others v. Abbas [1994]

2 SLR 365 cited by the Respondents, De Silva CJ quoted from the

text of Walter Pereira’s Laws of Ceylon, 2nd Edition, at page 396,

where it is stated that:

“As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere

general statement of witnesses that the plaintiff “possessed” the

land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive

period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse

possession necessary to support a title by prescription. It is

9

necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts, and

the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by the

Court”

23. In the instant case, taking into consideration the way the land

has been possessed by E.R. Gunawathie, at the cross-examination at

the District Court trial, she has admitted to physically possessing the

property in question from the years 1974 – 1990. There is also

evidence of there being a hut in the land. "1974 - 1990 ෙවනක% ෙමම

ඉඩෙ* ෙ+පල මම ./0 1%දා. ෙපා5 6වස/ ඇ9ලත ප;ං= ෙවලා >?යා" .(Page 245

of the brief).

“V: ෙයDජනා කරනවා තY% Zයන ෙලස ෙමම L 8 සැලැස්ෙ* සහ L 9 ඔ]^ෙ_ උප

ෙKඛනෙb සඳහ% ඉඩෙ* 6වස/ 0.ෙ% නෑ Zයා

උ: 6වස/ 0.නා. මම ඉ%ෙ% ළමO එ/ක.”

24. In the cross examination of Wickremasena Jeromanis Edirisinghe

(predecessor of the Respondent) also, the existence of this hut is

noted.

“V: ෙමM 6වස/ 0.ෙ% නැ+ද?

උ: 0.නා

V: එM ප;ං= ෙවලා >?ෙb කJද?

උ: ඒ කාෙK මට මතක නෑ හhයට Zය%න”

(Vide page 251 of the brief)

25. She has also acted in the capacity of the owner of the corpus in

question “A1” by selling it in 1980 and transferring it back to herself

in 1981 (vide pages 245, 246 of the brief). She has stated that she

paid assessment tax to the Municipal Council of Maharagama for four

years as well (pages 248, 249 of the brief). It is further evidenced

through the cross-examination of the Respondent at the District

Court that there is no proof of payment of assessment tax by him.

10

26. To establish title by prescription, it is also required that the

possession is held as “a title adverse to or independent of that of the

claimant or plaintiff”. The terms “adverse” or “independent” have been

interpreted to mean holding possession in a way that is incompatible

with the title of the paper title holder. Canekeratne J. in Fernando v.

Wijesooriya [1947] 48 NLR 320 at 325 stated the following:

“…It is necessary to inquire in what manner the person who had

been in possession during the time held it, if he held in a character

incompatible with the idea that the title remained in the claimant

to the property it would follow that the possession in such character

was adverse….”

27. It is further required that the possession be uninterrupted as per

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. In the case I.L.M. Cadija

Umma and Another v. Manis Appu and Others [1938] 40 NLR 392

at page 396, it was stated:

“…Their Lordships are unable to doubt that the purpose— perhaps

the somewhat ambitious purpose—of the parenthetical clause is to

explain the character of the possession which, if held without

disturbance or interruption for ten years, will result in

prescription….”

(emphasis mine)

28. In the case at hand, similarly, the oral evidence of E.R.

Gunawathie asserted that the Respondent had visited the land during

her occupation and did not interrupt or disturb her possession,

whereby the evidence points to possession that is adverse as

possession has been held incompatible with the title of the plaintiff.

29. I will also consider the police reports filed by both parties here.

In the police report dated 19.01. 2000 marked “V3”, the Appellant has

11

reported to the police about the construction of a fence by the

Respondent in the corpus. The police report dated 20.01.2000

marked “X7” mentions the threats the Appellant is alleged to have

made against the Respondent upon the Respondent attempting to

enter into the land. These actions are further proof such evidence to

conclude that the Appellant himself also did, in fact, hold possession

of the land in a way that was incompatible with the title of the plaintiff.

30. Therefore I am inclined to hold that the possession of the corpus

for 16 years by E.R. Gunawathie is capable of falling within the

standard of proof required to establish possession for the purposes of

S.3 of the Prescription Ordinance, and therefore, that the learned

District Court Judge has erred in law by failing to take into account

the oral evidence presented by E.R. Gunawathie in deciding on the

issue of prescription.

31. The learned counsel for the Respondent contented that the

Appellant of the instant case has no sufficient evidence to establish

possession during his period 1990 – 2000. I am of the view that this

position need not be considered as the title to the land was already

prescribed by the predecessor during her possession of 17 years.

32. At the hearing, the learned counsel for the Appellant furthered

the following argument in favour of the Appellant as well. It was

submitted to the Court that in the case 674/1994/L which was

instituted in the District Court of Mount Lavinia, concerning a

different corpus but the same Respondent as of the instant case, the

licensed surveyor, J. Jayawickrema in presenting the plan numbered

744, identifies the land in question of the current case and submits

that the Respondent is not in possession of that plot of land. (See page

396 of the brief). The case 674/1994/L has subsequently been

withdrawn by the Respondent’s Attorney.

12

33. Therefore, I hold that the Appellant has successfully established

a prescriptive title over the property described in the second schedule

to the plaint marked A1 in extent 23.75 perches in plan 10836,

answering the question set in subparagraph (a) of paragraph 24 of the

petition dated 02.05.2012 in the affirmative.

34. The Judgments of the High Court and the District Court are

therefore set aside and the Appellant (the Defendant in the District

Court) is entitled to a judgment in his favour as prayed for in the

District Court

35. The Learned District Judge of the District Court of Mount Lavinia

is directed to enter the decree in accordance with this judgment.
