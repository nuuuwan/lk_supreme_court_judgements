"would be a deviation from the task I have in hand and therefore, I would not embark on such"
"an exercise. For me, it would suffice to state here that whoever is caught up within the afore-"
"said subsequent Regulation made by the Minister  was not entitled to make such deduction"
"earlier, i.e., before the said subsequent Regulation, such a concession was non-existent and"
"therefore was not available for the taxpayer."
"Moreover, there can only be two possibilities for the issue whether the Respondent Company"
"is  caught  up  within  the  afore-said  subsequent  Regulation  made  by  the  Minister.  The  first"
"possibility  is  that  the  Respondent  Company  is  caught  up  within  the  afore-said  subsequent"
"Regulation. Then, the Respondent Company is allowed to make a deduction of one third of"
"the Nation Building Tax charged as a ‘prescribed tax or levy ’in terms of Section 26(1)(l)(iii)"
"of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  No.  10  of  2006.  The  second  possibility  is  that  the  Respondent"
"Company  is  not  caught  up  within  the  afore-said  subsequent  Regulation.  Then,  since  that"
"Regulation does not apply to it, the Respondent Company cannot make a deduction of one"
"third  of  the  Nation  Building  Tax  charged  as  a  ‘prescribed  tax  or  levy  ’in  terms  of  Section"
"26(1)(l)(iii) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006."
"The  first  scenario  (i.e.,  if  the  afore-said  subsequent  Regulation  applies  to  the  Respondent"
"Company)  necessarily  means  that  Section 26(1)(l)(iii) of the  Inland Revenue  Act No. 10  of"
"2006 also applies to the Respondent Company."
"The  second  scenario  (i.e.,  if  the  afore-said  subsequent  Regulation  does  not  apply  to  the"
"Respondent  Company;  this 
is  the  argument  advanced  by  the 
learned  counsel  for  the"
"Respondent  Company)  would  then  necessarily  mean  that  Section  26(1)(l)(iii)  of  the  Inland"
"Revenue  Act  No.  10  of  2006  must  be 
interpreted  without  recourse 
to  the  afore-said"
"subsequent  Regulation  made  by  the  Minister.  Indeed,  I  have  chosen  to  take  that  path  in"
"coming to the conclusion I have reached prior to the discussion on the issue of applicability"
"of the afore-said subsequent Regulation made by the Minister to the Respondent Company."
"The said conclusion is that there is no specific provision of law under which the Respondent"
"Company can become entitled to deduct the amount of Nation Building Tax it had earlier paid."
"That is why as already adverted to above by me, I have taken the view that I need not embark"
"on resolving the issue whether the Respondent Company is caught up within the afore-said"
"subsequent Regulation made by the Minister in order to address the issue placed before me"
"in the instant case."
