"11-2011. Hence, it is Section 163(5)(a)(i) of the IRA which applies in respect of the return of"
"income submitted by the Respondent Company in the instant situation. This means that the"
"time period allowed by Section 163(5)(a)(i) of the IRA for making an assessment is a period"
"of two years from the thirtieth day of November 2011. In other words, the afore-said two-"
"year period commences to run from 30-11-2011."
