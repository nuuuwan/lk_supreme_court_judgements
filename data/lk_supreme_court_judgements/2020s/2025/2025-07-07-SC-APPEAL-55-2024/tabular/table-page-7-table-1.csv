"advanced by the learned President’s Counsel for the Respondent Company is that the Notice"
"of  Assessment  was  posted  on  03rd  December  2013  and  therefore  was  received  by  the"
"Respondent Company on a date later than the date it was posted. It  is  the position  of the"
"Respondent  Company  that  both  the  making  of  the  Assessment  and  giving  notice  of  such"
"Assessment must be done before the expiry of two years."
"It is on that basis that the Respondent Company seeks to argue that the Assessment is time"
"barred even when the Assessment is taken to have been issued on 29th November 2013. This"
"is on the basis that the Respondent Company has received the Notice of Assessment only on"
"a date after 03rd December 2013 (date it was posted)."
"I observe that the Court of Appeal in its judgment, having cited Section 164 of the IRA which"

"making of Assessment and not to the serving of the notice of Assessment and the serving of"
"the  Notice  of  Assessment  is  not  a  pre-condition  to  the  validity  of  the  making  of  the"
"Assessment.2 I agree."
"If the provision of law set out in Section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 as"
"amended by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 2011 is clear and unambiguous"
"in  its  meaning, then  that  meaning  must  be  given  effect  to  as  it  is  a  taxing  statute.  Courts"
"cannot read into sections when interpreting provisions of law in such statutes. I have dealt"
"with this aspect of law in more detail in the course of the discourse I have had with regard to"
"the question of law No. 02 in the pages ahead. Therefore, it would suffice for me to state here"
"that I will apply the same theory when interpreting Section 163(5) of the IRA at this stage of"
"the judgment as well."
"Section 163(3) of IRA is as follows:"
