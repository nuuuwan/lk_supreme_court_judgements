"issued.  That  is  an  act  which  is  different  to  the  act  of  communicating  the  reasons  for  not"
"accepting the Return of Income. Section 163(3) of the IRA is amply clear on this. Therefore,"
"I am unable to subscribe to the view taken by the Court of Appeal that that the Assessment"
"shall be deemed to have been made by the Assessor on 09th September 2013 which is the"
"date of the communication in writing to the tax payer under Section 163(3) of the IRA, the"
"Assessor’s  reasons  for  not  accepting  the  Return  of  Income  submitted  by  the  Respondent"
"Company.  I  hold  that  it  is  the  date  the  Assessment  is  issued  by  the  Assessor  (i.e.,  29th"
"November 2013) which must be taken for the calculation of the time bar set out in Section"
"163(5)."
"There is no dispute that if the Assessment can be taken to have been made on 29-11-2013"
"then it has been made within the time prescribed by Section 163(5) of the Inland Revenue"
"Act  No.10  of  2006  as  amended  by  the  Inland  Revenue  (Amendment)  Act  No.  22  of  2011."
"However, let me for the sake of completeness, further elaborate on this aspect."
"Section 106(1) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 has mandated that a taxpayer shall"
"furnish a return of his income for any year of assessment commencing on the 1st day of April"
"of  a  given  year  and  ending  on  the  31st  day  of  March  of  the  immediately  succeeding  year."
"Under this section, such taxpayers must submit their returns of income before the 30th day of"
"September  of  the  said  immediately  succeeding  year.  Thus,  the  term  ‘year  of  assessment ’"
"under this Act is a year commencing from 1st April of a given year and ending on the 31st of"
"March of the following year."
"The  Respondent  Company  has  submitted  its  return  of  income  for  the  Year  of  Assessment"
"2010/2011  on  30-11-2011.  The  Year  of  Assessment  which  is  denoted  as  2010/2011  is  the"
"year commencing from 1st April 2010 and ending on 31st of March 2011. Therefore, the Year"
"of Assessment 2010/2011 is a year of assessment which commences prior to April 1, 2013 for"
"the purpose of Section 163(5) (a)(i) of the IRA."
"Section  163(5)  (a)(i)  of  the  IRA  has  stated  that  the  two-year  period  referred  therein"
"commences to run from the thirtieth day of November of the immediately succeeding year of"
"assessment.  As the relevant  year  of assessment is 2010/2011, the  immediately succeeding"
"year  of  assessment  thereto,  is  the  year  of  assessment  2011/2012.  This  is  the  year  of"
"assessment commencing from 1st April  2011 and ending  on 31st  of March 2012. Therefore,"
"the thirtieth day of November of the immediately succeeding year of assessment referred to"
"in Section 163(5) (a)(i) of the IRA for the purpose of the instant case would be 30-11-2011."
