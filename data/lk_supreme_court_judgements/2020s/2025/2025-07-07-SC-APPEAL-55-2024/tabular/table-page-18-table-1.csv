"Moreover, the Respondent Company does not claim that it is an entity which has not paid NBT"
"at the time of importing its products. It does not seek to argue that NBT is not a prescribed"
"tax  or  levy.  It  also  does  not  show  any  other  provision  which  makes  it  entitled  to  have  an"
"exemption from Section 26(1)(l)(iii) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006. What then is"
"the result? The result is that the Respondent Company is not entitled to deduct the amount"
"of Nation Building Tax it had earlier paid, in its return of income. This is because the liability"
"of  the  Respondent  Company to income  tax  without such  deduction is  found  in  a clear and"
"unambiguous  manner  in  the  taxing  statute  coupled  with  the  fact  that  the  Respondent"
"Company has failed to show any other provision which makes it entitled to have an exemption"
"from Section 26(1)(l)(iii) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006."
"Furthermore, I observe that in Section 5(1) of the NBT Act No. 9 of 2009, the Director General"
"of Customs only functions as a collector of NBT at the point of importation of goods. I also"
"observe  that  the  Act  itself in  Section  5(2), has  stated that any amount  so  collected  by the"
"Director  General  of  Customs,  as  per  the  above  provision  shall  be  deemed  to  be  the  tax"
"chargeable in respect of the tax liability of the turnover arising from the importation of such"
"article. Further, such tax is deemed to have been paid by such a person to the Commissioner"
"General on the day on which such amount was collected by the Director General of Customs."
"Therefore, I am satisfied that it is the NBT that is collected by the Director General of Customs"
"on behalf of the CGIR at the point of importation of goods."
"According  to  Section  5(3)  of  the  NBT  Act,  the  NBT  is  collected  by  the  Director  General  of"
"Customs as if it is a customs duty. This, in my view, is only a mechanism put in place by the"
"Act for the easy recovery of NBT in case of a default. Moreover, the liability of the Respondent"
"company to pay NBT to the Director General of Customs at the time of importation, is imposed,"
"not by Customs Ordinance but by the NBT Act. The charging section for payment of NBT when"
"the  Respondent  Company  pays  this  tax  to  the  Director  General  of  Customs  is  the  same"
"charging provision of law which is Section 2 and Section 3 of the NBT Act. There is no separate"
"section in the NBT Act which compels the Respondent Company to make such payments to"
"the Director General of Customs. As I stated before, Section 5 only deals with the recovery"
"process to ensure that the NBT is paid at the time of importation. Therefore, in my view, there"
"is  no  merit  in  the  argument  advanced  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent  Company  that  Section"
"26(1)(l)(iii) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 has no application to the Respondent"
"Company.  For  those  reasons,  I  reject  the  said  argument.  I  hold  that  the  decision  of  the"
"Assessor to reject the Return of Income submitted by the Respondent Company and issue the"
