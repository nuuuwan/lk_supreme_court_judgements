"[SC APPEAL 55/2024] Page 19 of 19"
"Assessment in terms of Section 106(1) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 is justified"
"and lawful."
"For the foregoing reasons I answer the question of law No. 02 in the negative."
"The Court of Appeal, by its judgment dated 19-05-2023, has annulled the Determination dated"
"12-06-2018 made by the Tax Appeals Commission. For the reasons set out in this judgment,"
"I have held that the said assessment is not time-barred and the Court of Appeal has erred in"
"law  when  it  held  that  the  said  assessment  is  time  barred.  On  this  basis,  I  set  aside  the"
"conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the Tax Appeals Commission has erred in law when it"
"came  to  the  conclusion  that  the  assessment  is  not  time-barred.  I  proceed  to set  aside the"
"decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  annul  the  assessment  affirmed  by  the  Tax  Appeals"
"Commission. The Court of Appeal judgment is set aside to that extent and should stand altered"
"to that extent."
"Thus, the assessment issued by the assessor, the determination made by the CGIR, and the"
"determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission affirming the assessment issued by the"
"assessor,  are  hereby  restored  and  will  remain  unaltered  and  affirmed.  That  would  be  the"
"resultant position."
