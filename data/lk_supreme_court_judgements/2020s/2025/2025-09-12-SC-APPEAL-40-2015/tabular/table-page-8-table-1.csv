"Question of Law No. 2"
"The learned trial judge held that no cause of action has accrued to the Appellant in the"
"absence of notifying the Respondent that he is now the owner of the corpus or the giving"
"of a notice to quit."
"The Respondent submitted that the Appellant had failed to prove that he informed the"
"Respondent of the new ownership and did not inform the Respondent to attorn to the"
"Appellant, nor pay the Appellant any rentals. The only allegation made by the Appellant is"
"that the Respondent verbally promised to the Appellant that he will vacate the corpus and"
"did not vacate as promised."
"According  to the Respondent, the  Appellant  had not proved that he had informed  the"
"Respondent to vacate the corpus and thereafter the Respondent promised to vacate the"
"corpus. In these circumstances, the Respondent submitted that no cause of action had"
"arisen in favour of the Appellant to institute this action against the Respondent."
"However, the principle is that  where an owner of property sues for ejectment, his real"
"cause of action is simply the fact that he is owner and therefore prima facie entitled to"
"possession. In this action, the Respondent is admittedly in possession of the corpus."
"In Graham v. Ridley (1931 T.P.D. 476 at 479) Greenberg, J. held that the cause of action in"
"that case arises out of the fact that the plaintiff is the owner and is therefore entitled to"
"possession, and whether a monthly lease is alleged, which has been lawfully terminated"
"or whether it is alleged that there is a long lease which has been lawfully terminated, it"
"does not affect her real ground of the right of possession."
"Greenberg, J. went on to refer (at page 479) to the following extract from the unreported"
"judgment in Gordon v. Kamaludin (T.P.D. 15.9.27):"
