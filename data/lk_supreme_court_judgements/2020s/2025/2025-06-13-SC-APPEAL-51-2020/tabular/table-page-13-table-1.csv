"establish that there was a stabbing incident where the 11th Defendant was the Defendant. All"
"the above stated evidence were placed before the District Court, apparently, to establish that"
"the 11th and 12th Defendant are licensees who are not related to the Plaintiff. When P3 shows"
"that the 11th Defendant had another address, other than the address relating to the land sought"
"to be partitioned, the original Plaintiff in 11V1 Affidavit had mentioned an address similar to"
"the  original  Plaintiff’s  address  as  the  address  of  the  11th  Defendant,  indicating  that  the  11th"
"Defendant also has an address in the land sought to be partitioned. The 11th Defendant in his"
"evidence had explained how and why he left the land sought be partitioned many years ago and"
"stayed with his brother, and also the reason for the other address was due to his livelihood being"
"related  to  fishing  in  the  sea.  However,  it  must  be  observed  that,  as  said  above,  what  the"
"substituted Plaintiff stated in relation to the 12th Defendant coming to stay in the land was not"
"from his personal knowledge, but rather, from things that he came to know from other sources,"
"and what he stated about the 11th Defendant in that regard also indicates that he was not the"
"one who gave such  permission to stay in the land but his aunt. He only put up a hut for the 11th"
"Defendant  to  stay.  The  11th  Defendant  did  not  admit  that  the  11th  to  13th  Defendants  are"
"licensees under someone. He marked V2, his birth certificate, to show that his place of birth is"
"‘Thotewatte’, the land sought to be partitioned.  This shows that the position of the Plaintiff,"
"that the 12th and 11th Defendants came to this land as licensees on a later occasion, cannot be"
"true, as those Defendants relationship with the land has a longer history indicating that their"
"mother was residing in the land sought to be partitioned even at the time of the 11th Defendant’s"
"birth. Further, this birth certificate shows that the name of the mother was Wedige Mai Nona;"
"a person who belongs to the Wedige lineage and was residing on the same property having the"
"same surname as the name of the original owner of the Plaintiff’s pedigree. The 11th Defendant"
"refers to the Plaintiff as maternal aunt’s son- vide page 304 of the brief. The 11th Defendant’s"
"evidence  was  that  Endorishamy  and  Matheshamy  who  owned  the  said  22/24  share  were"
"brothers and Charu Nona, mother of the Plaintiff, and the 1st to 3rd Defendant was one of the"
"Endorishamy’s child, and 11th, 12th Defendants and father of the 13th Defendants, Martin are"
"the children of Mai Nona, wife of Wilson, who was the only child of said Matheshamy. The"
"11th Defendant had also revealed one more child of Mai Nona in his amended Statement of"
"Claim and also in evidence, who is Peter. The above facts indicate, on balance of probability,"
"that  the  mother  of  the  11th  Defendant  and  the  mother  of  the  Plaintiff,  Charu  Nona,  both"
"belonged to the Wedige lineage and were living in the same property and they were relatives."
"Thus,  the  attempt  of  the  Substituted  Plaintiff  to  deny  the  relationship  of  the  11th  to  13th"
