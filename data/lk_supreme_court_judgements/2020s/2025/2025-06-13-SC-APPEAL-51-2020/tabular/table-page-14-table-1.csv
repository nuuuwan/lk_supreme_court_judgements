"ownership to the property. When the Plaintiff fails in proving that 11th and 12th Defendants are"
"licensees, his pedigree starting by showing 22/24 shares of the Corpus to Endorishamy cannot"
"explain the presence of the 11th and the 12th Defendants within the Corpus."
"A
s per the age given while giving evidence, it appears that the 11th Defendant is about 13 years"
"older than the Substituted Plaintiff. Thus, the 11th Defendant may have a better knowledge of"
"the pedigree of Wedige lineage. He had said that Endorishamy and Matheshamy were brothers"
"and the 22/24 share belonged to them. Further, he had explained how Endorishamy’s rights"
"would devolve as shown in the Plaint, and Matheshamy’s rights should come to his only child,"
"Mai Nona, his mother. He had also explained how Mai Nona’s rights should devolve according"
"to his knowledge. As per his evidence, he was born in the land sought to be partitioned in 1943"
"and he had left the land after his mother’s demise in 1962. After staying with his brother in a"
"different address and doing jobs such as fishing in the sea, he had stated that he returned to the"
"land sought to be partitioned in or around 1968, married in 1973 while living in the ancestral"
"house and putting up a house for his own. He had also explained in his evidence that even after"
"returning to the land sought to be partitioned, how on certain times, he stayed in another address"
"due  to  his  job  relating  to  fishing  in  the  sea.  He  had  further  stated  that  the  12th  Defendant,"
"Lilasena, lives in the ancestral house. He had categorically denied that he is a licensee under"
"anyone. Even the X1 reports made by the surveyor shows that the 12th Defendant had claimed"
"buildings and plantations in the Corpus."
"I
t  is  observed  that  even  though  the  11th  Defendant  had  stated  in  his  evidence-in-chief  that"
"Endorishamy and Mateshamy had inherited from their father, during the cross examination, he"
"had stated that he does not know who their father was and how those two got title to the land"
"in dispute. This indicates that the 11th Defendant does not know the owner prior to Endorishamy"
"and Matheshamy. This may be the reason that he named the original owner in his Statement of"
"Claim as ‘a man belonged to the Wedige Lineage (වැ#ෙ% &’ෙස))’on the premise that the"
"father of said Matiashamy and Endorishamy was the original owner. However, in his evidence,"
"the 11th Defendant had said that Endorishamy was the elder brother, while Matheshamy was"
"the younger brother, indicating that he has some personal knowledge of that relationship, but"
"at one place, he had stated that he came to know this relationship through an elderly person"
"over 100 years of age, who was dead by the time he was giving evidence. However, I do not"
"see that this evidence can be accepted in terms of Section 32(5) of the Evidence Ordinance as"
"it is not revealed as to how the said person got that special knowledge and as to when that"
