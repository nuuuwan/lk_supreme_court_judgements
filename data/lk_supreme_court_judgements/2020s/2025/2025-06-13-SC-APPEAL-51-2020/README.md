E.A.G.R Amarasekara, J.

This is an appeal made against the Judgment dated 17.09.2019 of the Civil Appellate High

Court of Southern Province holden in Galle in Case No. SP/HCCA/GA/74/2013/(F) which

affirmed the Judgment dated 02.07.2013 of the District Court of Galle in Case No. 12942/P.

The aforesaid action in the District Court was a partition action filed by the original Plaintiff,

one Wadumesthrige Gilman to obtain a partition decree for the land named ‘Thotewatte’

morefully described in the schedule to the Plaint in accordance with the pedigree shown in the

said Plaint dated 05.10.1995. As per the said Plaint, entitlement to the shares in the land have

been shown to the Plaintiff and the 1st to 10th Defendants and the position in the Plaint was that

12th Defendant resides in the land with the consent of the parties and the 11th Defendant is a

licensee of the 3rd Defendant who came to the land 3 years prior to the date of the Plaint.

The 1st Defendant filed its Statement of Claim dated 06.03.2003 in line with the averments in

the Plaint and had stated that 11th, 12th and 13th Defendants are there as licensees and they have

no rights in the property.

SC/APP/51/2020

9

The 14th, 15th, and 16th Defendants who later intervened in the said partition action have

tendered a Statement of Claim dated 12.02.2010, which basically corresponds with the Plaint

but further expands the devolution of title shown to the 5th and 7th Defendants in the Plaint

explaining how the shares shown to them in the Plaint devolve on their successors due to the

death of those parties. The said Statement of Claim also reveals that Pinhamy referred to in the

pedigree of the Plaintiff had another child named Lilinona and how her share should devolve

after her demise. Hence, this Statement of Claim by the 14th, 15th and 16th Defendants only

suggest some amendments to certain branches of the Plaintiff’s pedigree which is not in dispute

in this appeal.

The 11th Defendant first filed his Statement of Claim dated 15.06.2001 and then filed the

amended Statement of Claim dated 30.08.2002. As per the pedigree presented by the amended

Statement of Claim by the 11th Defendant, the number of original owners and the entitlements

of the original owners differ from the that of the pedigree of the Plaintiff. As per the Statement

of Claim filed by the 13th Defendant dated 23.01.2002, his claim corresponds with the pedigree

presented by the 11th Defendant but reveals that Gonapeenuwala Withanage Simon mentioned

in the pedigree of the 11th Defendant had four more children besides 13th Defendant.

Thus, the Plaintiff, 1st Defendant, and 14th, 15th, and 16th Defendants apparently stood on one

stance as to the original ownership of the land sought to be partitioned, and the 11th and 13th

Defendants stood on a different stance as to the same.

The admissions and points of contests relevant to the trial concerned in this appeal had been

recorded on 29.01.2007, where the parties had admitted the Corpus sought to be partitioned as

Lot 1 in in the Preliminary Plan No.539 made by R. S. Weerasekara, L.S. On that date the

Plaintiff had raised points of contest No.1 to 4 while the 4th Defendant had raised the point of

contest No. 5. On the same date, the 11th to 13th Defendants had raised their points of contest

No. 6 to 13. During the trial, points of contest No. 14, 15 by the 11th Defendant (vide

proceedings dated 09.09.2008) and No. 16, 17 and 18 by the 14th to 21st Defendants (vide

proceedings dated 29.07.2010) had been raised.

Even though the 1st Defendant started giving evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff, it appears his

evidence was not concluded as a date was moved by the Plaintiff to add some parties before

the conclusion of the cross-examination by the 11th Defendant. Thus, later on, the substituted

SC/APP/51/2020

10

Plaintiff had given evidence and closed his case reading his documents marked P1 and P2 in

support of the pedigree relied on by the Plaintiff and the parties who stood with him. P1 and

P2 are two deeds that establish pedigree and title to 2/24 of the extent of the Corpus which is

not in dispute in this appeal. The 11th Defendant had given evidence in support of the pedigree

he stated in his Statement of Claim and closed his case reading in evidence documents marked

11V1 and 11V2. 11V 1 is an Affidavit, dated 05.10.1995, tendered by the original Plaintiff for

an application related to an injunction where the 11th Defendant’s address is mentioned by the

Plaintiff similar to his address to indicate that both were residing in the same land, which is an

indication of an admission as to the fact that the 11th Defendant resides in the subject matter.

V2 is the birth certificate of the 11th Defendant. P3 and P4, which are a charge sheet and a

journal entry of a case respectively, had been marked during the cross examination of the 11th

Defendant to show that he had a criminal case for stabbing a person as stated by the substituted

Plaintiff in his evidence. As per the substituted Plaintiff’s evidence, it was this incident that

caused the 11th Defendant to come to this land and the reason to permit him to stay there in the

subject matter. Other than those documents, Preliminary Plan and its report also had been

marked in evidence as X and X1. Apart from the aforesaid documents, it was the oral evidence

of the substituted Plaintiff and the 11th Defendant that was available for the learned Additional

District Judge to decide the pedigree for the balance 22/24 share of the Corpus, of which the

original ownership was in dispute between the contesting parties.

After the conclusion of the evidence, the learned Additional District Judge held with the

original ownership stated by the 11th Defendant and decided the pedigree in accordance of that

finding. In the appeal made by the Substituted Plaintiff Appellant, even the learned High Court

Judges approved the decision of the learned Additional District Judge. When the leave to appeal

application was supported on behalf of the substituted Plaintiff-Appellant, this Court has

granted leave on the following questions of law.

“1. Did the learned Judges of the High Court fail to consider the fact that the 11th to 13th

Respondents did not prove the pedigree referred to in their statement of claim?”

Consequential Question of Law raised by the Counsel for the 12A Defendant-Respondent;

“2. Whether the Petitioner has failed to prove his pedigree in regard 22/24 of shares of the

corpus referred to in the plaint?”

SC/APP/51/2020

11

As said before there is no dispute as to the identification of the Corpus and the original

ownership of 2/24 of the shares of the Corpus. As per the stance of the Plaintiff, this 2/24 was

originally owned by Pinnaduwage Kathohamy, Peththayadhdhehige Appusignho, Mangonona,

Miththohamy, Ganhewage Yasohamy, Siligallage Arnolis, Ganhewage Endoris and

Wathudura Uderishamy, who were the vendors in Deed No.396 marked P2. Through P2 they

have transferred their rights over the land to Arlis Wijesuriya, and the rights of said Arlis

Wijesuriya had been devolved upon Justin, Conistance, Regina, Dislin and Agnes by paternal

inheritance. All of them had transferred their rights to Wedige Chara Nona by Deed marked

P1. With the demise of Chara Nona said 2/24 share had been devolved on the Plaintiff, 1st, 2nd

and 3rd Defendants in equal portions. The learned Additional District Judge had found that part

of the Plaintiff’s pedigree as correct, which is also supported by the Deeds marked P1 and P2.

The 11th to 13th Defendants did not appeal against the Judgment of the learned Additional

District Judge which is in favour of them. No other party appealed against the said Judgment

other than the Substituted Plaintiff-Appellant. However, the said finding of the learned

Additional District Judge relating to the said 2/24 of shares of the Corpus was in accordance

with the Plaintiff’s Pedigree, and the said devolution of title to the 2/24 shares of the Corpus is

not in dispute.

What is disputed is the original ownership of the balance 22/24 shares of the Corpus. The

Plaintiff’ and the Defendants’ who stands together with the same stance had taken up the

position that the original owner of the said 22/24 was one Wedige Endorishamy, On the other

hand, the 11th Defendant’s position was that the original ownership of the said 22/24 was with

a man in the Wedige lineage and the said person had two children who were the said

Endorishamy mentioned in the Plaintiff’s pedigree and one Matheshamy and as such, the

ownership of each of them was limited to 11/24 shares of the Corpus. Hernce, his position was

that said 11/24 of the Endorishamy should devolve according to the Plaintiff’s pedigree and

the balance 11/24 should devolve according to the pedigree shown by him giving rights to the

11th to 13th Defendants.

The substituted Plaintiff in his evidence-in-chief itself had stated that Wedige Endorishamy

had his entitlements to the land but he did not know the extent of that entitlement- vide page

221 of the brief. Same answer had been given during cross examination- vide page 231 of the

brief. The substituted Plaintiff had not seen Endorishamy in during his life time -vide page 232

SC/APP/51/2020

12

of the brief. As per the evidence given in pages 233 and 234 of the brief, he once had attempted

to state that Endorishamy obtained his rights through a deed and again had stated by inheritance

from his parents. Again, at page 244 had stated that he does not admit that it was from paternal

inheritance but at page 245 states that it was from paternal inheritance the aforesaid

Endorishany obtained his rights to the Corpus. No deed or document showing the

Endorishamy’s entitlement to the Corpus had been marked before the learned Additional

District Judge. The learned Additional District Judge in her Judgement had stated that he spoke

of a fiscal auction but no such fiscal conveyance was marked in evidence. It appears that it was

the 1st Defendant, whose evidence was not concluded, stated so in evidence. However, no such

fiscal conveyance had been marked in evidence.

The above clearly show that the evidence led on behalf of the Plaintiff was not sufficient to

establish that the said Endorishamy was an original owner for a 22/24 share of the Corpus. In

fact, if it was not for the position of the 11th Defendant that Endorishamy had 11/24, there is

no reliable evidence from the substituted Plaintiff to establish the extent of the original

ownership of the said Endorishamy other than a mere statement to say that the said

Endorishamy had 22/24 share of the Corpus. However, he has through his evidence had

explained how, through inheritance, Endorishany’s entitlement devolve on the Plaintiff and the

other Defendants who rely on the Endorishamy’s entitlement. It appears that the 11th Defendant

had not challenged that part of inheritance except the original ownership for 22/24 shares of

the Corpus. During his evidence, the substituted Plaintiff has denied that there was a brother

named Matheshamy to the aforesaid Endorishamy but his lack of knowledge and consistency

shown even with regard to Endorishamy cannot make this denial to be considered as one made

with a well-informed knowledge.

The Substituted Plaintiff in his evidence had attempted to indicate that the12th Defendant came

to the land 30 years ago as his grandmother brought him into the land. However, it appears

what he says is what he came to know and not of his first-hand knowledge- vide page 224 of

the brief. Again, he has stated that the 11th Defendant came to his aunt’s house about 15 years

ago after a brawl with someone, and later, she allowed the 11th Defendant to stay in the land

and he put up a hut for the 11th Defendant to stay in the Corpus – vide pages 224, 234, 235 and

246 of the brief. He had further stated that he knew the 11th Defendant as one who came to do

farming work of theirs and does not know him as a relative- vide page 230 of the brief.

Aforesaid P3 and P4 had been marked during the cross examination of the 11th Defendant to

SC/APP/51/2020

13

establish that there was a stabbing incident where the 11th Defendant was the Defendant. All

the above stated evidence were placed before the District Court, apparently, to establish that

the 11th and 12th Defendant are licensees who are not related to the Plaintiff. When P3 shows

that the 11th Defendant had another address, other than the address relating to the land sought

to be partitioned, the original Plaintiff in 11V1 Affidavit had mentioned an address similar to

the original Plaintiff’s address as the address of the 11th Defendant, indicating that the 11th

Defendant also has an address in the land sought to be partitioned. The 11th Defendant in his

evidence had explained how and why he left the land sought be partitioned many years ago and

stayed with his brother, and also the reason for the other address was due to his livelihood being

related to fishing in the sea. However, it must be observed that, as said above, what the

substituted Plaintiff stated in relation to the 12th Defendant coming to stay in the land was not

from his personal knowledge, but rather, from things that he came to know from other sources,

and what he stated about the 11th Defendant in that regard also indicates that he was not the

one who gave such permission to stay in the land but his aunt. He only put up a hut for the 11th

Defendant to stay. The 11th Defendant did not admit that the 11th to 13th Defendants are

licensees under someone. He marked V2, his birth certificate, to show that his place of birth is

‘Thotewatte’, the land sought to be partitioned. This shows that the position of the Plaintiff,

that the 12th and 11th Defendants came to this land as licensees on a later occasion, cannot be

true, as those Defendants relationship with the land has a longer history indicating that their

mother was residing in the land sought to be partitioned even at the time of the 11th Defendant’s

birth. Further, this birth certificate shows that the name of the mother was Wedige Mai Nona;

a person who belongs to the Wedige lineage and was residing on the same property having the

same surname as the name of the original owner of the Plaintiff’s pedigree. The 11th Defendant

refers to the Plaintiff as maternal aunt’s son- vide page 304 of the brief. The 11th Defendant’s

evidence was that Endorishamy and Matheshamy who owned the said 22/24 share were

brothers and Charu Nona, mother of the Plaintiff, and the 1st to 3rd Defendant was one of the

Endorishamy’s child, and 11th, 12th Defendants and father of the 13th Defendants, Martin are

the children of Mai Nona, wife of Wilson, who was the only child of said Matheshamy. The

11th Defendant had also revealed one more child of Mai Nona in his amended Statement of

Claim and also in evidence, who is Peter. The above facts indicate, on balance of probability,

that the mother of the 11th Defendant and the mother of the Plaintiff, Charu Nona, both

belonged to the Wedige lineage and were living in the same property and they were relatives.

Thus, the attempt of the Substituted Plaintiff to deny the relationship of the 11th to 13th

Defendants during his evidence and to show them as mere licensees is an attempt to hide their

SC/APP/51/2020

14

ownership to the property. When the Plaintiff fails in proving that 11th and 12th Defendants are

licensees, his pedigree starting by showing 22/24 shares of the Corpus to Endorishamy cannot

explain the presence of the 11th and the 12th Defendants within the Corpus.

As per the age given while giving evidence, it appears that the 11th Defendant is about 13 years

older than the Substituted Plaintiff. Thus, the 11th Defendant may have a better knowledge of

the pedigree of Wedige lineage. He had said that Endorishamy and Matheshamy were brothers

and the 22/24 share belonged to them. Further, he had explained how Endorishamy’s rights

would devolve as shown in the Plaint, and Matheshamy’s rights should come to his only child,

Mai Nona, his mother. He had also explained how Mai Nona’s rights should devolve according

to his knowledge. As per his evidence, he was born in the land sought to be partitioned in 1943

and he had left the land after his mother’s demise in 1962. After staying with his brother in a

different address and doing jobs such as fishing in the sea, he had stated that he returned to the

land sought to be partitioned in or around 1968, married in 1973 while living in the ancestral

house and putting up a house for his own. He had also explained in his evidence that even after

returning to the land sought to be partitioned, how on certain times, he stayed in another address

due to his job relating to fishing in the sea. He had further stated that the 12th Defendant,

Lilasena, lives in the ancestral house. He had categorically denied that he is a licensee under

anyone. Even the X1 reports made by the surveyor shows that the 12th Defendant had claimed

buildings and plantations in the Corpus.

It is observed that even though the 11th Defendant had stated in his evidence-in-chief that

Endorishamy and Mateshamy had inherited from their father, during the cross examination, he

had stated that he does not know who their father was and how those two got title to the land

in dispute. This indicates that the 11th Defendant does not know the owner prior to Endorishamy

and Matheshamy. This may be the reason that he named the original owner in his Statement of

Claim as ‘a man belonged to the Wedige Lineage (වැ#ෙ% &'ෙස))’on the premise that the

father of said Matiashamy and Endorishamy was the original owner. However, in his evidence,

the 11th Defendant had said that Endorishamy was the elder brother, while Matheshamy was

the younger brother, indicating that he has some personal knowledge of that relationship, but

at one place, he had stated that he came to know this relationship through an elderly person

over 100 years of age, who was dead by the time he was giving evidence. However, I do not

see that this evidence can be accepted in terms of Section 32(5) of the Evidence Ordinance as

it is not revealed as to how the said person got that special knowledge and as to when that

SC/APP/51/2020

15

statement was made. Even if it is considered that it is not proved that Endorishamy and

Matheshamy are brothers, the evidence of the 11th Defendant is clear that the Matheshamy had

11/24 shares in the Corpus and it devolved upon their mother, Mai Nona, and accordingly, that

share must come to the heirs of Mai Nona.

In Magilin Perera v Abraham Perera (1986) 2 Sri Lr 208 at 210, it was stated: “Therefore,

in actual practice it is the usual, and in my view sensible, attitude of Courts that it would not

be reasonable to expect proof within very high degrees of probability on questions such as

those relating to the original ownership of land. Courts by and large countenance infirmities

in this regard, if infirmities they be, in an approach which is realistic rather than legalistic, as

to do otherwise would be to put the relief given by partition decrees outside the reach of very

many persons seeking to end the co-ownership.”

It must also be noted that the Plaintiff failed to prove the 11th and 12th Defendants are licensees,

and the occupation of the 12th Defendant in the Corpus as per the Surveyor’s report is indicative

of the rights of the people in the 11th Defendant’s pedigree to the land in dispute. As said before,

the substituted Plaintiff’s evidence was not satisfactory even to say that Endorishamy had the

ownership to 22/24 shares or any lesser portion. It is only the admission by the 11th Defendant

that he too had 11/24, that makes it possible to consider granting of rights as per the Plaintiff’s

pedigree from the original ownership of Endorishamy. It is so admitted on this basis that the

said Endorishamy and Matheshamy are brothers. In fact, challenging that relationship on behalf

of the substituted Plaintiff, challenges their claim through the original ownership of

Endorishamy, as they failed to prove that the said Endorishamy was the owner of said 22/24

share of the land.

It must be noted that all contesting parties who claimed from the said 22/24 share of the Corpus

claim through inheritance and no one had tendered a single deed to claim any share from the

said 22/24 share of the Corpus. Thus, there is no documentary evidence that refers to the

entitlement of that share. Thus, the Court has to decide it based on the oral evidence available

along with the other supporting documents to establish the relevant conflicting stances taken

by the Parties. The Court has to decide the said entitlement on a balance of probability. The

11th Defendant, being the grandson, should have known Mathiashamy as his grandfather and

his mother, Mai Nona, as his daughter and V2 birth certificate proves that Mai Nona was his

mother. As it is not proved that they are licensees under anyone of the Plaintiff’s pedigree, his

SC/APP/51/2020

16

occupation of the Corpus along with the occupation of the 12th Defendant who gain rights as

per the 11th Defendant’s pedigree show that they are entitled to the Corpus. There is nothing to

doubt the evidence of the 11th Defendant, that they are entitled to 11/24 of the shares of the

Corpus, as per the pedigree relied upon by them starting from Matheshamy while giving the

balance 11/24 to the people who comes under Plaintiff’s pedigree where the Plaintiffs failed to

prove the extent of share entitlement to their original owner, Endorishamy, through the

evidence of the substituted Plaintiff, if not for the admission by the 11th Defendant of the

entitlement to 11/24 share by Endorishamy. It must be noted that the Plaintiff’s pedigree does

not explain the presence of the 11th and 12th Defendants within the Corpus when they failed to

prove their stance that they are licensees but the 11th Defendant’s pedigree shows that it is

because they are co-owners.

It appears that the learned Additional District Judge more or less of the grounds discussed

above held in favour of the 11th Defendant’s stance accepting the pedigree of the 11th Defendant

to the said 22/24 share of the Corpus. The said Additional District Judge, who delivered the

Judgment, heard the case and observed the witnesses. I cannot find that the findings of the

learned Additional District Judge as perverse. The learned High Court Judges affirmed the said

Judgment stating that the learned Additional District Judge had properly evaluated the evidence

and the Judgment had been delivered in accordance with the evidence led at the trial. It is also

stated by the learned High Court Judges that the learned Additional District Judge had

investigated the title of the parties.

The Counsel for the substituted Plaintiff had cited many cases including Peris v Perera 1 N L

R 362 at 367, Gooneratne v Bishop of Colombo 53 N L R 337 and Mather v Tamotharam

Pillai 6 N L R 246 to indicate that the Court should be satisfied as to the entitlement of the

parties before it enters a decree in favour of them. There is no doubt as to the correctness of

that view. It is also trite law that, in a partition action, it is the paramount duty of the Court to

investigate title. However, the Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery. It has to decide based

on the available evidence. Even to call further evidence, there must be an indication that other

evidence is available. The learned Additional District Judge, after evaluating the available

evidence, had come to the conclusion that the stance taken up by the 11th Defendant is the

correct stance. This Court does not see that conclusion as an improbable or perverse conclusion

as per the evidence led at the trial. The learned High Court Judges affirmed the Judgment of

SC/APP/51/2020

17

the learned Additional District Judge. This Court cannot find that the High Court Judges erred

in that regard.

Therefore, the Question of Law No.1 referred to above is answered in the Negative and the

Question of Law No.2 referred to above is answered in the affirmative.

Hence, this appeal is dismissed with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
