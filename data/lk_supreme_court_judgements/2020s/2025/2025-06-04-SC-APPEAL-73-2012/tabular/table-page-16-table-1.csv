"C
onduct of the Respondent"
"The court record of the trial court and the appellate courts illustrates that the Appellant"
"on numerous instances  had  moved court to obtain orders and interim relief prohibiting and"
"restraining the Respondent from making improvements to the building already constructed in"
"the  disputed  land  and  also  to  direct  the  Respondent  to  remove  unlawful  construction  of"
"pathways and stairways which amply showcase the conduct of the Respondent."
"W
hilst this Appeal was being heard before this Court too, we note that an application"
"was made, by the Appellant and on 05-06-2023 Order was made for the parties to maintain the"
"status-quo as at the date Leave to Appeal was granted by Court, and to maintain the said status-"
"quo until the appeal is heard and determined."
"N
umber of years have passed consequent to the filing of the instant case in the District"
"Court of Kegalle and in view of the impugned judgements, the Respondent is utilizing the land"
"situated in a hilly terrain in the town of Bulathkohupitiya to his benefit and to the detriment of"
"the Appellant."
"Conclusion"
"H
aving  considered  the  factual  matrix,  the  law  governing  ownership  of  property  and"
"rights and title of the parties, and for reasons more fully adumbrated in this judgement, I see"
"merit in the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the impugned Order of"
"the High Court and the judgement of the District Court, dismissing the action should be set"
"aside. I am  not inclined to accept the contention of the learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel  for the"
"Respondent, that the dismissal of the plaint was valid and justified."
"T
his Court granted the Appellant Leave to Appeal, only on two Questions of Law more"
"fully  referred  to  earlier  in  the  judgement.  I  answer  the  said  two  Questions  of  Law  in  the"
"affirmative and in favour of the Appellant."
"I
 hold that the dismissal of the  plaint was erroneous and the Appellant is entitled to"
"have a declaration of title in respect of his co-owned rights to the subject matter in dispute, as"
"was determined by the learned trial judge by answering issues bearing numbers 1, 2 and 4 in"
"favour of the Appellant. Accordingly, I allow the appeal."
