"maintain a rei vindicatio action against the 2nd Defendant, and if at all only a partition action"
"could  have  been  instituted  and  that  too,  only  if  the  Plaintiff  accepted  the  fact  that  the  2nd"
"Defendant is also a co-owner of the corpus."
"The Defendant relied on the judgement of Hariette v. Pathmasiri (1996) 1 SLR 358,"
"to  justify  their  case.  In  the  said  case  the  Defendant  contended,  it  was  held,  in  order  for  a"
"Plaintiff  to  obtain  a  declaratory  action,  the  burden  to  adduce  exclusive  possession  and"
"acquisition of prescriptive right by ouster is on the Plaintiff. Applying the said observations to"
"the instant case, the contention of the Defendant was that in this instance, the Plaintiff failed"
"to establish exclusive possession of the total extent of land, including the four perches of land"
"which was leased to the 1st Defendant and occupied by the 1st Defendant and therefore, the"
"Plaintiff cannot obtain declaratory relief for the subject land described in the schedule to the"
"plaint."
"The learned judges of the High Court by their Order dated 04th August 2011, dismissed"
"the appeal of the Plaintiff. The reason for dismissal was that the 1st Defendant entered the land"
"lawfully and had complied with the terms of the lease agreement. Furthermore, the learned"
"judges of the High Court held, that there was no evidence to substantiate that the 1st Defendant"
"was requested to attorn or was informed about the termination of the lease and therefore the"
"1st Defendant was not a trespasser of the subject matter in dispute as contended by the Plaintiff."
"The High Court also held, the Plaintiff cannot maintain this action, for lesser relief than"
"what was prayed for, relying upon the case of Attanayake v. Ramyawathie (Supra), since the"
"Plaintiff failed to establish exclusive ownership for the larger land."
