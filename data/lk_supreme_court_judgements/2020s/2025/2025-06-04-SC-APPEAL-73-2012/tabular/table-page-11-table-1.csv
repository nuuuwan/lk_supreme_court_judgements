"undisturbed possession of the said land for long years and had prescribed to the subject land."
"Thus, the Appellant contended before this Court, that in the said circumstances, dismissing the"
"Plaintiff’s application was wrong and not in accordance with the law and facts."
"Furthermore, the contention of the Appellant was after answering the afore discussed"
"issues pertaining to title, in favour of the Plaintiff and accepting that the Plaintiff has co-owned"
"rights to the land in dispute, the dismissal of the plaint by the learned trial judge was erroneous."
"Therefore, it was argued that in the least, the Plaintiff’s co-owned rights to the land in dispute,"
"should have been recognized by way of a declaratory right, since the learned District Judge"
"answered issues bearing numbers 1,2 and 4 in favour of the Plaintiff."
"The  two  questions  of  law  raised  before  this  Court,  revolves  around  the  Plaintiff’s"
"co-owned title to the land in dispute. Thus, we see merit in the Appellant’s submissions that"
"the  said  two  questions  of  law  should  be  answered  in  the  affirmative  and  in  favour  of  the"
"Appellant."
"Notwithstanding  the  above,  I  wish  look  at  the  law  pertaining  to  the  dispute  from  a"
"different perspective."
