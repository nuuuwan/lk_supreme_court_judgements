"his undivided share of the land and title to the land described in the schedule to the plaint,"
"which is the subject matter in dispute."
"Further, the Plaintiff contended that the Plaintiff, even if he is considered as a co-owner,"
"was entitled to have the Defendant ejected since he has failed to attorn to the Plaintiff and also"
"failed  to  pay  ground  rent  to  the  Plaintiff  and  acknowledge  the  Plaintiff  as  the  landlord."
"Therefore, the Defendant cannot resist the action only by showing that the Defendant has a"

"Moreover, the Plaintiff submitted, even if it’s accepted that the Plaintiff’s predecessor"

"agreement  (approx.  4  perches)  out  of  54  perches,  of  the  disputed  land  for  a  studio  to  the"
"1st Defendant, that the Plaintiff can still have the 1st Defendant ejected from the rest of the land,"
