"The case of the Plaintiff was that he acquired title to the land in dispute from one Agnes"
"Fernando  upon  Deed  bearing  No.  4410  dated  31-12-1988  and  that  Agnes  Fernando,  the"
"Plaintiff’s  predecessor  in  title,  acquired  title  to  the  said  land  from  Caroline  Fernando  on"
"21-03-1965  upon  Deed  bearing  No.17683.  Thus,  the  Plaintiff  submitted  that  from  the  year"
"1965, the Plaintiff’s predecessor Agnes Fernando had undisputed and uninterrupted title to the"
"subject  land,  upon  a  notarially  executed  deed  for  a  period  of  23  years  when  the  Plaintiff"
"obtained title to the land in 1988."
"The  aforesaid  contention  of  the  Plaintiff,  was  further  substantiated  by  Plaintiff’s"
"predecessor in title Agnes Fernando who gave evidence at the trial and stated under oath, that"
"Caroline  Fernando  from  whom  Agnes  Fernando  acquired  title  to  the  land  in  extent  of  54"
"perches was her mother. She further traced the line of title to her grandfather Singho Fernando."
"Her  evidence  was  that  her  grandfather  Singho  Fernando  and  his  brother  Soota  Fernando"
"amicably divided the land known as “Koswatta” and Singho Fernando possessed the “Western"
"portion of the said land”. Agnes Fernando further contended that Agnes Fernando’s mother"
"Caroline  Fernando,  and  Caroline  Fernando’s  two  brothers,  James  Fernando  and  Michael"
"Fernando received title to the said “Western portion of Koswatta” (together with other lands)"
"upon  paternal  inheritance  and  the  three  siblings,  amicably  settled  their  rights  and  shares,"
"inherited from their father Singho Fernando by exchange of lands and title, and possession of"
"“Western  portion  of  Koswatta”  the  land  in  issue  was  given  to  Caroline  Fernando  and  she"
"possessed the subject land, undisturbed and uninterrupted and had prescriptive title to the said"
"land. Agnes Fernando further contended, therefore not only she, but her mother too had clear"
"title and possessed the subject land, undisturbed and uninterrupted and had prescriptive title to"
"the demarcated land, more fully referred to in the plaint, for a very long period."
"In  the  aforesaid  background,  let  me  look  at  the  issues  1,  2,  and  4  once  again.  Issue"
"number one raised at the trial was whether the original owners of the land referred to in the"
"schedule  to  the  plaint  were  Singho  Fernando  and  Soota  Fernando;  issue  number  two  was,"
"whether Agnes Fernando acquired such rights from Singho Fernando and Soota Fernando; and"
"issue number four, whether such rights devolved on the Plaintiff."
"Having  examined  the  evidence,  the  deeds  and  documents  the  learned  trial  judge"
"answered the said issues as “Yes, subject however to the co-owner’s rights”"
"Thus, the trial judge accepted the Plaintiff’s title and that the rights of the Plaintiff’s"
"predecessors, running back to a number of years, devolved upon the Plaintiff, subject however"
"to co-owned rights."
"Upon perusal of the judgement of the District Court, it is further observed, that the trial"
"judge did not refer to who the co-owners were or what was the share that was bestowed upon"
