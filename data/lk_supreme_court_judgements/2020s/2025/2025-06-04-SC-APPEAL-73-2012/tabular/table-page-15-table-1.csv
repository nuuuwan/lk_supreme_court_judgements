"The learned President’s Counsel relied on the following two judgements to justify his"
"contention that the dismissal of the Plaintiff’s case was in order. viz., Wijesuriya v. Senaratne"
"[1997] 2 SLR 323 and the case of Sirinivasa Thero v. Sudassi Thero 63 NLR 31."
"W
e have considered the aforesaid judgements in detail. In the Wijesuriya v. Senaratne"
"case, the matter in issue was a tenant cultivator and improper admission of evidence and the"
"submission  of  the  President’s  Counsel  was  that  the  relief  not  prayed  in  a  plaint  cannot  be"
"granted by a court as it changes the character of the application. In Sirinivasa Thero’s case,"
"the matter relate to the declaration of the office of Viharadhipathi, wherein, the decree issued"
"was in relation to possession of Vihara property and the Court held, that the issuance of a writ"
"of possession was not in order as the principal relief sought was not the issuance of a writ."
"I
n my view, the aforesaid cases relating to tenant cultivator and Viharadhipathi have no"
"relevance or bearing on the appeal under consideration, which relates to a declaratory title of"
"an owner/ co-owner and therefore can be easily distinguished. In any event we have already"
"considered the dicta in Attanayake v. Ramyawathi case (Supra) and have come to the finding"
"that a lesser relief, than what is prayed for can be granted by a trial court."
"Having contended that the Appellant cannot maintain a rei vindicatio action, the learned"
"President’s  Counsel’s,  next  submission  was  that  the  Appellant,  being  a  co-owner,  ought  to"
"have filed a partition action."
"A
s discussed earlier in this judgement, the case of the Appellant was that he had sole"
"and  exclusive  title  to  the  land  in  issue  and  that  the  Respondent  was  only  the  lessee  of  the"
"Appellant’s predecessor Agnes Fernando. Secondly, the Respondent paid ground rent to Agnes"
"Fernando but consequent to Agnes Fernando transferring the property to the Appellant, the"
"Respondent failed and refused to attorn to the Appellant and also refrained from paying any"
"ground rent to the Appellant."
"I
n my view, the factual matrix related above, does not entail a partition action being"
"filed, as the Respondent under no circumstances can be considered as a party, who will come"
"within the realm of a co-owner. He is a mere licensee or a lessee and in view of his failure to"
"attorn or pay ground rent to the Appellant, falls within the definition of a trespasser."
"T
hus, I see no merit in the aforesaid argument of the learned President’s Counsel for"
"the  Respondent  that  the  dismissal  of  the  plaint  was  correct  and  the  only  application  the"
"Appellant could have filed was a partition action and not a land  action, as was filed in this"
"instance."
