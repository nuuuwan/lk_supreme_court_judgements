"the Plaintiff. However, it appears that the learned judge was not convinced that the Plaintiff"
"and his predecessor Agnes Fernando, had exclusive and clear possession of the subject land."
"The reason for such view seems to be that there were no notarially executed documents and/or"
"plans pertaining to the amicable settlement said to have been entered between Singho Fernando"
"and  Soota  Fernando,  produced  before  the  trial  court.  Similarly,  there  were  no  plans  or"
"notarially executed deeds produced by the Plaintiff, pertaining to the mutual settlement of the"
"lands said to have been entered between Agnes Fernando’s mother, Caroline Fernando and her"
"two siblings."
"H
owever, there was the evidence of Agnes Fernando. It is observed that there was no"
"reason stated in the judgement to reject the evidence given by Agnes Fernando. The learned"
"judge held that the devolution of title to Caroline Fernando and her siblings in relation to the"
"subject land was not explained by the Plaintiff and his predecessor Agnes Fernando, to the"
"satisfaction of the trial court. Similarly, the amicable division said to have been arrived by and"
"between  Singho  Fernando  and  Soota  Fernando,  by  which  Singho  Fernando  possessed  the"
"“Western portion of Koswatta” too, had not been to the satisfaction of the trial judge. These"
"shortcomings, though not specifically stated may have been the reason, that the learned trial"
"judge accepted the Plaintiff’s title, subject to co-owner’s rights."
"However, the trial judge’s aforesaid findings about the Plaintiff’s co-owned title to the"
"land in dispute, have not been challenged or questioned by the Defendants and or by any other"
"person and or by any other co-owner before the High Court or any other judicial forum. The"
"said findings stand undisputed and unchallenged. In the aforesaid circumstances, I see merit in"
"the submissions of the learned Counsel for the Appellant, that the trial court should not have"
"dismissed  the  plaint,  but  should  have  granted  the  declaratory  order  sought  by  the  Plaintiff."
"Hence,  the  two  questions  raised  before  this  Court,  should  consequentially  be  answered  in"
"favour of the Appellant."
"Independent to the above we have considered in detail the factual matrix, the chain of"
"title,  the  deeds  relied  upon  by  the  Plaintiff,  and  this  Court  is  satisfied  that  the  Plaintiff  has"
"established his right and title, to the subject land. The only question remaining is whether it is"
"exclusive or co-owned. In the appeal, we do not wish to analyse the said factual position and"
"thus, will not disturb the findings of the trial judge in respect of the Plaintiff’s co-owned title"
"to the land in dispute, especially since, the questions of law for which our answer is sought is"
"not framed on such lines."
"In any event the main relief the Plaintiff sought in the District Court was a declaration"
"of title to the land morefully described in the schedule to the plaint. The Plaintiff’s contention"
"was that the rights devolved upon him as described in the plaint and that the predecessors in"
"title  (Agnes  Fernando,  Caroline  Fernando,  and  Singho  Fernando)  had  uninterrupted  and"
