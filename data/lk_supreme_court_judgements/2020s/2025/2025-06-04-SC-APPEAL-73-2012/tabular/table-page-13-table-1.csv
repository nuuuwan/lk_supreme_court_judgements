"the Plaintiff’s predecessor in title Agnes Fernando."
"T

"Superficiarium but simply accepted the Defendant’s version, and that there was no evidence"
"led  pertaining  to  the  ‘attornment’  or  ‘cancellation  of  the  lease’  and  held  that  the  Rent  Act"
"should govern such a situation."
"T
his finding of the trial judge, in my view, leads to an absurd situation. In the instant"
"case,  the  Defendant,  whether  he  being  a  licensee  or  lessee,  will  have  the  right  to  continue"
"possessing the ‘leased land’ without paying ground rent, whereas the lessor will not even have"
"a paper title. Undisputedly, by notarial execution, the lessor/ landlord Agnes Fernando, sold"
"her  rights  and  title  and  transferred  the  property  to  the  Plaintiff.  Thus,  even  though  Agnes"

"in view of the finding of the trial judge the Defendant can deny the title of the landlord. Thus,"
"the Plaintiff the bona fide purchaser, will not be entitled to obtain title to his own property,"
"whereas the lessee will continue to possess not only the four perches leased to him but the"
"entire land in extent 54 perches."

"numbers 1, 2 and 4 accepted and acknowledged that the Appellant has co-owned rights to the"

"O
ur law of property based on the principles of Roman Dutch Law and the jurisprudence"
"governing proprietary rights, clearly identifies the use and exploitation of co-owned property"
"by co-owners, against third parties and against co-owners themselves."
"I

"of  a  co-owner  to  sue  a  trespasser  to  have  his  title  to  an  undivided  share  declared  and  for"
"ejectment  of  the  trespasser  from  the  whole  land,  in  view  of  the  fact  that  an  owner  of  an"
