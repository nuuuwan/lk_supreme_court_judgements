"Defendant’s  contention  was  that  ground  rent  in  a  sum  of  Rs.  100  and  Rs  50  were  paid"
"respectively in terms of the said two lease agreements to Agnes Fernando. Though the five"
"year lease period in terms of the lease agreement had lapsed, the Defendant contended that he"
"continued to make the payments to Agnes Fernando."
"Thus, the case of the 1st Defendant was that he was the lawful tenant of Agnes Fernando,"
"the  lease  was  never  terminated,  that  the  Plaintiff  did  not  request  him  to  attorn  to  him,  and"
"therefore  moved  for dismissal of the  Plaintiff’s  action. The 1st Defendant also prayed for  a"
"declaration that he is the lawful tenant of the photographic studio put-up on the disputed land."
"The 2nd Defendant, (who was added on the intimation of the 1st Defendant, but from"
"whom no relief was claimed by the Plaintiff) in her answer contended that she acquired title to"
"a land in extent of 30 perches from one Podisingho, upon Deed bearing No. 622 dated 18-08-"
"1990 (i.e., consequent to filing of the plaint) and that prior to the acquisition of the property"
"she was in the said land as a lessee and built a house on the said land somewhere around 1985."
"The 2nd Defendant also sought dismissal of the Plaintiff’s action and a declaration that she is"
"entitled to 30 perches and the house she built on the said land, upon the basis that she had co-"
"owned rights to the land in dispute."
