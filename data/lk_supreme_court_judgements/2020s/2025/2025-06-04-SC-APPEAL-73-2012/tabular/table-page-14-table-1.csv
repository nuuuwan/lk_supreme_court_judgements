"several co-owners may without joining any other co-owners in the action, sue a trespasser for"
"a declaration of his undivided share, ejectment and damages."
"T
hus, even based upon the finding that the Appellant is a co-owner, our law permits"
"the Appellant to sue a trespasser because the co-owner has an interest in every grain of sand"
"and every grass blade growing on the co-owned land."
"I do not wish to go on an academic discourse in relation to co-owners, trespassers and"
"ejectment because, its not relevant nor necessary to examine such matter in considering the"
"two questions that this Court is called upon to decide."
"S
uffice  it  to  state,  although  the  learned  trial  judge  held  that  the  Defendant  is  not  a"
"trespasser (since the Defendant did not refuse to attorn or the Defendant was not intimated that"
"the lease was terminated), I am of the view by continuing to occupy the subject land against"
"the  wishes  of  the  Appellant,  that  the  Defendant  has  abandoned  the  status  of  lessee  and/or"
"licensee and has exposed himself to being a mere trespasser."
"I
n any event, the plaint and the relief sought indicates that the Plaintiff is willing to"
"compensate the Defendant for improvements made, as per the terms of the lease agreement"
"entered between the Plaintiff’s predecessor Agnes Fernando and the 1st Defendant and also has"
"prayed for an alternative relief in the plaint to pay compensation to the Defendant and eject the"
"Defendant from the subject law land."
"I
t is not my intention to tread the areas of ejectment and compensation as the questions"
"of law raised before this Court are not akin to same and it is not a matter before this Court as"
"stated above."
"N
evertheless,  as  observed  in  the  case  of  Hariette  v.  Pathmasiri  (Supra),  since  this"
"Court recognizes the right of a co-owner to sue a trespasser to have his title to an undivided"
"share declared, I am of the view that there is merit in the submissions of Dr. Coorey, the learned"
"Senior Counsel for the Appellant, that the Appellant should be granted a declaratory order in"
"relation to co-own the subject land. Thus, and for that reason too, I would answer the questions"
"of law in favour of the Appellant and allow the appeal."
"Rei-vindicatio Action Vs. Partition Action"
"The  submission  of  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  for  the  Respondents  before  this"
"Court was that the case filed by the Plaintiff does not fall within the ambit of a rei vindicatio"
"action and therefore should be dismissed."
