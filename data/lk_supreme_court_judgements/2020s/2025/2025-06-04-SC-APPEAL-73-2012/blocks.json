This is an appeal against the judgement of the Civil Appellate High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province, Holden in Kegalle (\u201cthe High Court\u201d) dated 04th August, 2011. The Plaintiff-Appellant-Appellant (\u201cthe Plaintiff/the Appellant\u201d) instituted an action in the District Court of Kegalle in July 1990 seeking inter-alia a declaration of title to the land described in the schedule to the plaint in extent half an acre and ejectment of the Defendant-Respondent-Respondent (\u201cthe Defendant/the Respondent\u201d) from the said land. In the alternative, the Plaintiff prayed for the ejectment of the Defendant from the premises occupied by him, consequent to the sum incurred by the Defendant for construction of the building on the said land being paid to him by the Plaintiff. The Defendant took up the position that he was the lawful tenant of the Plaintiff\u2019s predecessor and upon the consent of the Plaintiff\u2019s predecessor, the Defendant constructed a building on the leased land at a cost of Rs. 250,000.00 and thus, the Plaintiff does not have a cause of action against the Defendant and moved for dismissal of the plaint. The Defendants further pleaded that his daughter is a necessary party to this action. The Plaintiff filed amended caption and added the daughter of the Defendant as a party to this case. The original Defendant thus, became the 1st Defendant and the added party the 2nd Defendant. The 2nd Defendant, in her answer took up the position that she on her own right acquired title to the land described in the plaint and that the Plaintiff has no cause of action to sue her and moved that the Plaintiff\u2019s action be dismissed. The case went into trial. Admissions were recorded, issues raised and evidence of many witnesses led. Thereafter, the District Judge, by judgment dated 11th May, 2010 dismissed the case of the Plaintiff, with costs, on the basis that the Plaintiff has failed to establish his case. Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Plaintiff went before the High Court and the High Court too, affirmed the judgement of the District Court and dismissed the Plaintiff\u2019s appeal.",

Plaintiff\u2019s case Before the trial court, the Plaintiff contended that the subject land was transferred to him, by one Agnes Fernando, by virtue of a Deed bearing No. 4410 dated 31-12-1988, 18 months prior to filing of the plaint. The Plaintiff further contended that the said Agnes Fernando, before transferring the land to him, has leased out a defined portion of land from the aforesaid land, to the Defendant upon two lease bonds bearing No. 286 dated 24-11-1975 and No. 318 dated 28-01-1980 respectively. Further, the Plaintiff pleaded that the Defendant had constructed a small building on a defined portion of the leased land and carried on a business of a photographic studio at the said premises. The Plaintiff also contended upon the Plaintiff purchasing the said land in 1988, the Plaintiff requested the Defendant to attorn to him. The Defendant failed and refused to attorn to the Plaintiff. Furthermore, the Defendant did not pay ground rent to the Plaintiff but continued to occupy the premises and also disputed the Plaintiff\u2019s ownership to the leased land, which the Plaintiff contended was based upon Jus Superficiarium a Roman Law concept. Defendant\u2019s case The case of the 1st Defendant was that he came into occupation of the subject land and constructed a photographic studio, as a tenant of Plaintiff\u2019s predecessor Agnes Fernando and therefore he is entitled to the protection of the provisions of the Rent Act. He further contended that in terms of the lease agreement bearing No. 286 the studio was constructed upon the terms stated in the said agreement and he paid ground rent to Agnes Fernando. The Defendant also contended that by a subsequent lease agreement bearing No. 318, he was permitted to expand the studio for which too, he paid an additional amount as ground rent to Agnes Fernando.

Though the five year lease period in terms of the lease agreement had lapsed, the Defendant contended that he continued to make the payments to Agnes Fernando. Thus, the case of the 1st Defendant was that he was the lawful tenant of Agnes Fernando, the lease was never terminated, that the Plaintiff did not request him to attorn to him, and therefore moved for dismissal of the Plaintiff\u2019s action. The 1st Defendant also prayed for a declaration that he is the lawful tenant of the photographic studio put-up on the disputed land. The 2nd Defendant, (who was added on the intimation of the 1st Defendant, but from whom no relief was claimed by the Plaintiff) in her answer contended that she acquired title to a land in extent of 30 perches from one Podisingho, upon Deed bearing No. 622 dated 18-08-1990 (i.e., consequent to filing of the plaint) and that prior to the acquisition of the property she was in the said land as a lessee and built a house on the said land somewhere around 1985. The 2nd Defendant also sought dismissal of the Plaintiff\u2019s action and a declaration that she is entitled to 30 perches and the house she built on the said land, upon the basis that she had co-owned rights to the land in dispute. The Trial At the trial, Agnes Fernando predecessor in title of the Plaintiff, gave evidence for the Plaintiff and indicated the manner in which she acquired title to the land in dispute and also the manner in which she leased out the land to the 1st Defendant. In her evidence she admitted that the 1st Defendant paid her ground rent. Further, she stated based upon the terms of the first lease agreement, she permitted the construction of the photographic studio and by the second lease, the expansion of the studio. In her evidence she also explained, how she transferred the land together with everything standing thereon to the Plaintiff, by Deed bearing No. 4410 on 31-12-1988.",

Further, the learned judge held that the Plaintiff has filed the plaint on an erroneous and wrongful basis, and that the facts do not relate to a rei-vindicatio situation and/or a matter in which an ejectment order can be given against the Defendants. Nevertheless, it is observed that the learned judge answered certain issues in favour of the Plaintiff, especially issues bearing numbers 1,2 and 4 and some others which are not material to this appeal. The District Court also rejected the Defendants\u2019 claim, that they had co-owned rights to the land in dispute and specifically held that the Defendants were tenants of the Plaintiff\u2019s predecessor Agnes Fernando. Appeal before the High Court Being aggrieved by the trial court judgement, the Plaintiff went before the High Court. In appeal the Plaintiff contended that the learned trial judge had erred by holding that the Plaintiff cannot maintain this action, when the evidence given by the Plaintiff established that the 1st Defendant has failed to attorn and pay ground rent to the Plaintiff, in order to continue to be in possession of the studio. It is observed, that the High Court decided the appeal on written submissions, and no opportunity was given to the parties to make oral submissions. Before the High Court, the contention of the Plaintiff was that the trial judge failed to appreciate that a lessee cannot deny the title of the landlord. Further, he contended that even if the Plaintiff was considered not as a sole owner of the land but a co-owner, that a co-owner can maintain an action to evict a trespasser and also that a co-owner can maintain an action against another co-owner, to obtain a declaration in respect of the co-owned right. The Plaintiff also stated, that the trial judge answered issues bearing numbers 1,2 and 4 relating to the title of the Plaintiff in favour of the Plaintiff, subject however to the fact that the Plaintiff is entitled to undivided shares of the corpus. Thus, the contention of the Plaintiff was after arriving at the said finding in respect of the corpus that the Plaintiff is entitled to undivided shares of the corpus, that the trial judge could not have dismissed the plaint, but should have granted a declaration in respect of the Plaintiff\u2019s ownership to the undivided shares of the corpus. Therefore, it was argued that the dismissal of the plaint by the trial judge was erroneous and should be reviewed in appeal. Further, the Plaintiff relied on the decided case of Attanayake v. Ramyawathie (2003) 1 SLR 401 to contend, that if an appellant has asked for a greater relief than he is entitled to, the mere claim for a greater share in the land should not prevent him having a judgement in his favour for a lower share in the land. Thus, it was contended, although the plaint did not",

In this instance the Plaintiff was willing to pay a sum of Rs 250,000.00 said to be the cost incurred by the Defendant, for construction of the building and the improvements made thereto, as averred to by the 1st Defendant in his answer. The Plaintiff also contended that the Rent Act has no applicability in this instance, since the 1st Defendant, admittedly only paid ground rent to the Plaintiff\u2019s predecessor and ground rent, was not rent for a premises or a building but was only for the demarcated land leased to the Defendant for a specific time period, based upon the terms of the lease agreement. With regard to the 2nd Defendant, the contention of the Plaintiff was that the learned trial judge erred in answering issue No. 19 in the affirmative, after answering issue numbers 17 and 18, pertaining to the title of the 2nd Defendant, as \u2018not proved\u2019. Further, it was the case of the Plaintiff that the crucial deed bearing No. 622 dated 18-08- 1990 relied upon by the 2nd Defendant, had been executed after this action was filed and the other deeds produced had no relevance to the land in dispute. In response to the said contention of the Plaintiff, the Defendants in their written submissions relied upon the fact that the Plaintiff did not seek any relief against the 2nd Defendant (though she was added as a party to the action) and further that the Plaintiff cannot",

The Defendant relied on the judgement of Hariette v. Pathmasiri (1996) 1 SLR 358, to justify their case. In the said case the Defendant contended, it was held, in order for a Plaintiff to obtain a declaratory action, the burden to adduce exclusive possession and acquisition of prescriptive right by ouster is on the Plaintiff. Applying the said observations to the instant case, the contention of the Defendant was that in this instance, the Plaintiff failed to establish exclusive possession of the total extent of land, including the four perches of land which was leased to the 1st Defendant and occupied by the 1st Defendant and therefore, the Plaintiff cannot obtain declaratory relief for the subject land described in the schedule to the plaint. The learned judges of the High Court by their Order dated 04th August 2011, dismissed the appeal of the Plaintiff. The reason for dismissal was that the 1st Defendant entered the land lawfully and had complied with the terms of the lease agreement. Furthermore, the learned judges of the High Court held, that there was no evidence to substantiate that the 1st Defendant was requested to attorn or was informed about the termination of the lease and therefore the 1st Defendant was not a trespasser of the subject matter in dispute as contended by the Plaintiff. The High Court also held, the Plaintiff cannot maintain this action, for lesser relief than what was prayed for, relying upon the case of Attanayake v. Ramyawathie (Supra), since the Plaintiff failed to establish exclusive ownership for the larger land. The Appeal before this Court If I may summarize, the appeal before this Court is based on the two questions of law for which leave was granted. The grievance of the Appellant is that the dismissal of the plaint is erroneous and that the Appellant is entitled to a declaration from this Court at the minimum, in respect of the Appellant\u2019s undivided share to the subject matter in dispute, since the trial judge, accepted the entitlement of the Appellant by answering issue numbers 1, 2 and 4 in his favour. At this juncture, I wish to look at the factual matrix of the case. It is observed the issues 1, 2 and 4 pertain to the Plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to the land in dispute, which is more fully referred to in the schedule to the plaint as a land in extent of 54 perches being the western portion of the land known as \u2018Koswatta\u2019.",

Thus, the Plaintiff submitted that from the year 1965, the Plaintiff\u2019s predecessor Agnes Fernando had undisputed and uninterrupted title to the subject land, upon a notarially executed deed for a period of 23 years when the Plaintiff obtained title to the land in 1988. The aforesaid contention of the Plaintiff, was further substantiated by Plaintiff\u2019s predecessor in title Agnes Fernando who gave evidence at the trial and stated under oath, that Caroline Fernando from whom Agnes Fernando acquired title to the land in extent of 54 perches was her mother. She further traced the line of title to her grandfather Singho Fernando. Her evidence was that her grandfather Singho Fernando and his brother Soota Fernando amicably divided the land known as \u201cKoswatta\u201d and Singho Fernando possessed the \u201cWestern portion of the said land\u201d. Agnes Fernando further contended that Agnes Fernando\u2019s mother Caroline Fernando, and Caroline Fernando\u2019s two brothers, James Fernando and Michael Fernando received title to the said \u201cWestern portion of Koswatta\u201d (together with other lands) upon paternal inheritance and the three siblings, amicably settled their rights and shares, inherited from their father Singho Fernando by exchange of lands and title, and possession of \u201cWestern portion of Koswatta\u201d the land in issue was given to Caroline Fernando and she possessed the subject land, undisturbed and uninterrupted and had prescriptive title to the said land. Agnes Fernando further contended, therefore not only she, but her mother too had clear title and possessed the subject land, undisturbed and uninterrupted and had prescriptive title to the demarcated land, more fully referred to in the plaint, for a very long period. In the aforesaid background, let me look at the issues 1, 2, and 4 once again. Issue number one raised at the trial was whether the original owners of the land referred to in the schedule to the plaint were Singho Fernando and Soota Fernando; issue number two was, whether Agnes Fernando acquired such rights from Singho Fernando and Soota Fernando; and issue number four, whether such rights devolved on the Plaintiff. Having examined the evidence, the deeds and documents the learned trial judge answered the said issues as \u201cYes, subject however to the co-owner\u2019s rights\u201d Thus, the trial judge accepted the Plaintiff\u2019s title and that the rights of the Plaintiff\u2019s predecessors, running back to a number of years, devolved upon the Plaintiff, subject however to co-owned rights. Upon perusal of the judgement of the District Court, it is further observed, that the trial judge did not refer to who the co-owners were or what was the share that was bestowed upon",

Hence, the two questions raised before this Court, should consequentially be answered in favour of the Appellant. Independent to the above we have considered in detail the factual matrix, the chain of title, the deeds relied upon by the Plaintiff, and this Court is satisfied that the Plaintiff has established his right and title, to the subject land. The only question remaining is whether it is exclusive or co-owned. In the appeal, we do not wish to analyse the said factual position and thus, will not disturb the findings of the trial judge in respect of the Plaintiff\u2019s co-owned title to the land in dispute, especially since, the questions of law for which our answer is sought is not framed on such lines.
