"4.  In other words, there was a change of user and what was meant to be a Pilgrims"
"Rest transformed to be a shopping complex. The Appellants thus were the tenants"
"who held a contractual relationship with the YMBA, Vavuniya."
"5.  As  it  does  happen  in  cases  such  as  this,  the  Vavuniya  Urban  Council  issued  a"
"notice on the President, YMBA Vavuniya in October 1993 under Section 28 (A) (1)"
"(a) of the Urban Development Authority Law, No. 41 of 1978 (as amended) alleging"
"that  the  YMBA  had  contravened  Sections  8  J 
(1)  of  the  aforesaid 
law  by"
"constructing a shopping complex within the premises bearing assessment No. 19,"
"Horawapothana Road, Vavuniya and the said notice directed the President, YMBA"
"Vavuniya, who it alleged had executed the said development activity, to cease such"
"development activity forthwith and to restore the land on which such development"
"activity was being executed to its original condition. The notice gave the President,"
"YMBA  10  days  before  which  the  aforesaid  directions  were  to  be 
fulfilled."
"6.  As could be seen, the aforesaid directions are identically found in Section 28 (A)"
"(1) (a) and (b) of the UDA Law. It is worth noting while the notice referred to (a)"
"and (b) as above, the notice is silent on 28 (A) (1) (c). As the provision makes it"
"clear,  Section  28  (A)  (1)  (c)  provides  for  the  demolition  of  any  building  or  work."
"7.  Thus, the notice issued on the YMBA, Vavuniya did not require it to demolish the"
"shopping  complex.  It  only  required  the  YMBA,  Vavuniya  to  restore  the  land  on"
"which  such  development  activity  has  been  executed  to  its  original  condition."
"8.  Subsequent  to  this  notice,  the  Secretary,  Vavuniya  Urban  Council  made  an"
"application to the Magistrateâ€™s Court of Vavuniya praying inter alia ; for issuance"
"of  a  mandatory  order  under  Section  28  (A)  (3)  of  the  UDA  Law  authorizing  the"
"demolition  of 
the  unauthorized  building  at  No.  19,  Horawapothana  Road,"
"Vavuniya."
"9.  It repays attention that the notice initially issued did not necessitate a demolition"
"of the shopping complex but it rather required the restoration of the premises to"
