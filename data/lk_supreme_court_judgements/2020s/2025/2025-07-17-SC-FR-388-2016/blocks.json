This appointment was approved by the Board of Directors of LDBL on 6th March 2015. ii. On behalf of the Petitioner, in terms of section 42 of the Banking Act, the LDBL sought clearance from the 7th Respondent by submitting to the 7th Respondent P4 and P4A (P4 being the Affidavit of the Petitioner and P4A being the covering letter). iii. Since the 7th Respondent failed to respond to P4 and P4A within one (1) month of the notification to the CBSL, it must be deemed that the Petitioner was a fit and proper person to function as a Director of the LDBL.

If at all, the defect arises from the conduct of the Justice of Peace R.S. Pandithasekera by not having certified the Petitioners Affidavit correctly. v. The Petitioner satisfies the requisite criteria to be declared a fit and proper person, as contained in sections 42(2)(a) to (i) of the Banking Act. The DBS has never considered and decided that the Petitioner was not a fit and proper person to function as a Director of the LDBL. vi. In view of the foregoing, it must be deemed that the Petitioner had been duly appointed as a Director of the LDBL and had thereby been properly appointed as the Chairman of the bank. vii. The Petitioner is challenging the decisions contained in (i) P13 (sent by the 7th Respondent - Director, Bank Supervision, CBSL) stating that he was refusing to appoint the Petitioner as the Chairman of the LDBL, and (ii) P20 (sent by the 9th Respondent Secretary to the MBSL, CBSL) stating that the MBSL had decided to refuse both Appeals of the Petitioner contained in P18 and P19. However, what is in effect being challenged in these proceedings is the removal of the Petitioner from functioning as the Chairman / Director of LDBL. There is no provision in the Banking Act which authorises the 7th Respondent to refuse to appoint and/or remove a person as the Chairman of a bank. The position of Chairman is distinct from the position of Director. The methods for the appointment and removal of a Director are different to those of a Chairman. viii. The request of the LDBL to grant approval for the appointment of the Petitioner as a Director of the said bank, comes within section 42(4)(b) and section 42(8) of the Banking Act, since approval of the 7th Respondent DBS was sought after the appointment of the Petitioner as a Director and as the Chairman of the LDBL. In the circumstances, prior to the issue of P13, the 7th Respondent should have followed the procedure prescribed therein, which he has not done in the instant occasion. If at all, the removal should have been in terms of section 42(8)(a) by the 1st Respondent Monetary Board of Sri Lanka. On that ground too, P13 is ultra vires the powers of the 7th Respondent. Therefore, the 7th Respondent has acted in contravention of sections 42(4)(b), 42(6) and 42(8) of the Banking Act. ix. The 7th Respondent has wrongfully acted in terms of sections 42(4)(a) and 42(5) of the Banking Act.",

The DBS does not have legal authority to either approve the appointment of or remove the Chairman of a bank. Therefore, the purported removal of the Petitioner is ultra vires the powers vested in the 7th Respondent. xi. What the 7th Respondent has done amounts to removal of the Petitioner as the Chairman of the LDBL. He was not removed as a Director of the LDBL. It is section 42(8) of the Banking Act that provides for the removal of a Director of a bank. However, the 7th Respondent has not acted in terms of section 42(8) (which provides for removal of a Director of a bank after the initial appointment), and has purportedly acted under 42(2) read with section 76H of the Banking Act. xii. The purported reasons given by the 7th Respondent for the decision contained in P13 relates to the Petitioner having functioned as the Chairman of the LDBL and not as a Director of that bank. xiii. The officials of the CBSL have acted in bad faith by imposing retaliatory measures against the Petitioner in view of the regulatory failures highlighted by the Petitioner contained in P16B and P16C. xiv. The impugned conduct of the 7th Respondent DBS is unreasonable, arbitrary and illegal. xv. The 1st Respondent - MBSL which rejected the Appeal (P19) presented to it by the Petitioner, has not properly considered the grounds of Appeal contained in P19. Further, prior to rejecting the Appeal, the 1st Respondent did not afford the Petitioner a fair hearing. Therefore, the 1st Respondent has acted in violation of the rules of natural justice. xvi.

Since the LDBL is a licensed specialised bank, in terms of the Banking Act, it is subject to regulation by both the Monetary Board and the Director of Banking Supervision of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. ii. The authority given to the Secretary to the Treasury (in his capacity as the sole shareholder) to appoint Directors to the LDBL, is subject to the provisions of the Banking Act. Though the Memorandum of Association (MoA) of the LDBL empowers the Secretary to the Treasury to appoint and remove Directors of the LDBL, by virtue of the provisions of the Banking Act, that power of appointment is subject to the provisions of the Banking Act. Article 73 of the MoA empowers the Secretary to the Treasury to also nominate the Chairman of the bank. iii. In this instance, the Petitioner had been purportedly appointed by the Minister of Finance, which is in contravention of the provisions of the MoA. Therefore, the purported appointment of the Petitioner as the Chairman and as a Director of the LDBL was flawed. iv. In terms of the Regulations issued under the Banking Act, the Petitioner was required to submit a Declaration by way of an Affidavit to the 7th Respondent for him to be considered under section 42 of the Banking Act to be a fit and proper person to hold office as a Director of the LDBL. v. In the Petition to the Supreme Court, the Petitioner has taken up the position that this requirement was fulfilled by the submission of P4 and P4A. Such Affidavit and the Declaration submitted were contrary to the provisions of section 42(4)(b) of the Banking Act, in that, they had not been submitted within 15 days of the Petitioners appointment. Furthermore, drawing the attention of this Court to 7R1, the learned DSG submitted that the said Affidavit was contrary to law due to the fact that, while the Petitioner claims to have signed it on 6th March 2015, the Justice of Peace R.S. Pandithasekera who has purportedly attested the signature of the Petitioner as having been signed in his presence, has certified the Affidavit on 22nd April 2015. Therefore, that Affidavit was not valid as it contravened sections 12(2) and 12(3) of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance, No. 09 of 1895 (as amended). vi. Following the request made in June 2015 by the DBS to re-submit the said Affidavit and the declaration, on 17th July 2015, the Petitioner submitted another Affidavit which indicated that it had been signed and attested on 11th February 2015. That is the Affidavit (P4) which the Petitioner has presented to this Court along with P4A.",

By participating at a press conference held on 11th May 2015 and revealing confidential information, the Petitioner had grossly violated the secrecy provision contained in section 77 of the Banking Act. Therefore, the 7th Respondent dispatched 7R3 requiring the Petitioner to explain his conduct. Learned DSG drew the attention of this Court to portions of P16-B and P16-C (which are newspaper articles relating to the press conference held), which reveal that at the press conference the Petitioner had disclosed details of certain transactions of the LDBL. This was confidential information, which the Petitioner was prohibited from disclosing to the public. ix. By opening branches of the LDBL without the prior approval of the Monetary Board of Sri Lanka, Direction dated 21st November 1997, issued in terms of section 76(J)(1) of the Banking Act had been violated. The Petitioner was responsible for this violation. x.

Learned DSG pointed out that by his Appeal dated 5th June 2016 (P18) against P13, the Petitioner had admitted the allegations against him. In his second Appeal (P19) presented to the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner has elaborated his position contained in P18 and has taken up a new position that he had been removed as the Chairman of the LDBL and not as a Director.

Though P2 indicates that such appointment has been made in terms of section 73 of the Articles of Association of the LDBL, it must be noted that section 73 of the Articles of the LDBL provides that the Chairman of the Board shall always be nominated by the Secretary to the Treasury. Thus, the entitlement to nominate the Chairman of the LDBL has also been conferred on the Secretary to the Treasury. Furthermore, it provides that the Government shall be represented on the Board at all times with at least a minimum of two directors nominated by the Secretary to the Treasury. Section 74 provides that any shareholder who holds not less than twenty percent (20%) of the issued capital shall be entitled to nominate one (01) Director to the Board. Section 73 of the Articles must be read in conjunction with sections 204(2) and 205(1) of the Companies Act. Then, it becomes clear that the power of appointment of Directors is vested with the shareholders of the company. Since the Secretary to the Treasury holds 100% of the issued capital of the LDBL (the entirety of the shares of the company) he receives the entitlement to appoint all the Directors of LDBL. Similarly, it is the Secretary to the Treasury who may nominate the Chairman of the company. In terms of clauses 2(5)(iii) and 3(1)(iii) of Direction No. 12 of 2007 on Corporate Governance for Licensed Specialised Banks in Sri Lanka (P21) [issued by the 1st Respondent - MBSL], it is the Board (Board of Directors) of a licensed specialised bank that should appoint the Chairman of such bank. Therefore, the nomination of the Secretary to the Treasury should reach the Board of Directors appointed by the Secretary to the Treasury. The Board on a consideration of such nomination, should appoint the Chairman of the LDBL.",

It is the view of this Court that suitability arises out of two aspects: the persons being competent and them being persons with integrity. Given the complexity of banking operations and their impact on the financial markets, the overall financial sector, economy of the country and the interests of the customers and other transacting parties of banks, those at the level of the Board of Directors and key management personnel must be persons with (i) a high degree of competence, as reflected by their qualifications, (ii) previous work exposure and (iii) experience. Furthermore, they must be persons of high integrity, moral standing and unblemished reputation. It is for this purpose that section 42(2) contains certain criteria based upon which the Director of Bank Supervision may determine whether a particular individual is a fit and proper person to be appointed or function as a Director of a bank. Permitting a person who has lost his fit and proper status to remain to function as a Director of a bank would be most undesirable and contrary to the interest of all stakeholders of banks and the Sri Lankas public interest. 57.

The expectation of this Court is that, a party seeking relief from any court should reveal the truth and the whole truth, and should not cunningly suppress or distort relevant facts.

If in fact after processing 7R1 and 7R2, the 7th Respondent formed the view that the Petitioner is a fit and proper person to be appointed as a Director of the LDBL, it was his duty to act in terms of section 42(5) of the Banking Act and forthwith inform the LDBL of that finding. If it was his view that the Petitioner was not a fit and proper person, it was even more important for him to have taken steps to notify the LDBL of his view, so that the Petitioner could have, acting in terms of section 42(6) appealed against such decision, and also for the bank to have taken steps under section 42(7) to ensure that the Petitioner ceases to be a Director of the LDBL. Particularly since the Director Bank Supervision is the gatekeeper and policeman of those who function as Directors of banks, he should have acted promptly and taken a decision on the matter.

He has cited two reasons for his decision. They being, (i) failure of the Petitioner to comply with clause 3(5)(ix) of Direction No. 12 of 2007 and (ii) breaching confidentiality and thereby acting in contravention of section 77 of the Banking Act. The evidence placed before this Court amply supports both those findings. Furthermore, the 7th Respondent has presented to this Court adequate evidence in support of his contention that by his own conduct the Petitioner had established a sufficient evidential basis to conclude that he was an unfit and improper person to be permitted to continue to function as the Chairman / a Director of the LDBL. However, what is it that the Director Bank Supervision is empowered to do under such circumstances? According to section 42(8) of the Banking Act, the Director of Bank Supervision is required to submit a Report regarding the matter to the Monetary Board. The position of the 7th Respondent is that 7R7 was tantamount to the Report contemplated in section 42(8). Even if 7R7 is recognised by this Court to be the Report provided for by section 42(8), on a consideration of such Report, it is the Monetary Board that is empowered to declare that a Director of a bank is not a fit and proper person, and direct the bank in writing to remove such person from the office of Director within such period as may be specified in such direction, giving reasons for such direction, and notify in writing such person whose removal is required under such direction, of such direction, a copy of which shall be annexed to such notification. It would thus be seen that the terminology contained in P13 to the effect that I write to inform you of the refusal of appointment of Mr. Lasantha Goonewardena as the Chairman under the provisions of section 42(2) read with section 76(H) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 as amended, due to the following reasons is flagrantly ultra vires the powers conferred on the 7th Respondent by the Banking Act. In fact, the evidence does not disclose the 1st Respondent Monetary Board having dispatched its determination under section 42(8) of the Banking Act.",
