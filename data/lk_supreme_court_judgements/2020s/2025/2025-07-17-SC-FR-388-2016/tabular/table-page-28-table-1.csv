"Respondent,  if  the  Petitioner  wished  to  retain  a  copy,  he  would  have  either"
"obtained a photo-copy of the original “P4” or kept a copy of the original Affidavit"
"prior to applying the revenue stamp and singing it. As stated above, “P4” contains"
"an image of a revenue stamp on which the Petitioner had signed. If so, it must have"
"been a photo-copy of the original “P4”, and then the Registered Attorney could"
"not have certified it as a ‘true copy’, as it if at all is a ‘true copy’ of an uncertified"
"copy of “P4”."
"62. In any event, the narrative contained in the Petitioner’s Affidavit is incomplete, as"
"it does not contain any reference as to how “7R1” and “7R2” came to be dispatched"
"to the 7th Respondent and are found filed in the official file maintained by the 7th"
"Respondent."
