"","Secretary  to  the  Treasury  should  first  form  his  own  opinion  that  the"
"","identified person is a ‘fit and proper person’ to be appointed as a Director"
"","of  the  LDBL.  Doing  so  is  important  as,  in  terms  of  section  42(4)  of  the"
"","Banking Act, prior clearance that a person to be appointed as a Director is"
"","a 
‘fit  and  proper  person’  by 
the  Director  Bank  Supervision, 
though"
"","desirable, is not essential. Thus, the identification of a suitable person to be"
"","nominated / appointed as a Director should certainly not be founded upon"
"","the pleasure or the whims and fancies of the Minister of Finance or any such"
"","other person in authority."
"ii.","Upon  receipt  of  the  intention  of  the  Secretary  to  the  Treasury,  the  LDBL"
"","should,  acting  in  terms  of  section  42(4)(a)  of  the  Banking  Act  seek  the"
"","clearance of the Director Bank Supervision that the nominated person is a"
"","‘fit and proper person’."
"iii.","Should the Director Bank Supervision declare that the nominee is a ‘fit and"
"","proper  person’,  such  person  shall  be  appointed  by  the  Secretary  to  the"
"","Treasury as a Director of the LDBL."
"iv.","In  the  alternative  to  ‘i’,  ‘ii’  and  ‘iii’  above,  should  the  Secretary  to  the"
"","Treasury deem it appropriate and necessary to directly appoint a person as"
"","a  Director  of  the  LDBL,  he  shall  communicate  such  appointment  to  the"
"","LDBL. Following the receipt of the appointment, the LDBL shall acting in"
"","terms  of  section  42(4)(b)  of  the  Banking  Act,  within  15  days  of  such"
"","appointment,  notify  the  Director  Bank  Supervision  of  such  appointment,"
"","and  seek  clearance 
that  such  appointee 
is  a 
‘fit  and  proper  person’."
"","However, in terms of clause 2(3)(i) of Direction No. 12 of 2007 (issued by"
"","the 1st Respondent - MBSL) “directors should be fit and proper persons in order"
"","to be eligible to hold office as directors of a bank and no person should serve as a"
"","director unless such person is a fit and proper person”. It must also be noted that,"
"","if recourse is to be had by the Secretary to the Treasury to directly make an"
"","appointment  (without  seeking  the  prior  clearance  of  the  Director  Bank"
"","Supervision), he runs a serious risk, as the appointed person commences to"
"","function  as  a  Director  of 
the  bank  without  any  prior  vetting  by  an"
"","independent  authority  (such  as  the  Director  Bank  Supervision)  as  to  his"
"","suitability to function as a Director of the bank. Thus, the Secretary to the"
"","Treasury should have recourse to this course of action, only if there is an"
"","urgency or other good reason for doing so."
