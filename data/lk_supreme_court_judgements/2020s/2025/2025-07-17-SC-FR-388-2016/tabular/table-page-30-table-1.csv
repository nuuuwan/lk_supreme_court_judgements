"","Petitioner’s  explanation  supports  this  allegation.  There  is  no  proof  that"
"","some of the revelations made by the Petitioner at the Press Conference were"
"","already  in  the  public  domain.  Even  if  that  be  the  case,  that  is  not  a"
"","justification for acting in contravention of section 77 of the Banking Act. In"
"","any event, the statements made by the Petitioner at the Press Conference"
"","amounts  to  a  violation  of  the  prohibition  contained  in  section  77  of  the"
"","Banking Act."
"v.","Two  branches  of 
the  LDBL  had  been  opened 
in  Tambuttegama  and"
"","Akuressa, without obtaining the prior permission of the Monetary Board,"
"","as required by law. There is strict proof in support of this allegation."
"vi.","Bypassing the Credit Committee of the LDBL, the Petitioner had personally"
"","directed that certain loans be granted to some individuals. However small"
"","may be the loaned amounts, it remains a fact that it had been at the instance"
"","of  the  Petitioner  that  the  relevant  loans  had  been  granted,  bypassing  the"
"","internal procedures of the LDBL."
"67. In  view  of  the  afore-stated  developments  coming  to  the  attention  of  the  7th",""
"","Respondent,  he  claims  to  have  deferred  the  decision  to  grant  clearance  to  the"
"","Petitioner and to the other Directors of the LDBL as ‘fit and proper’ persons. I am"
"","unable to accept that position due to the following reasons, notwithstanding the"
"","fact that other than in respect of (ii) above, there is adequate evidence in support"
"","of the allegations contained in the preceding paragraph. However, it is necessary"
"","to note that, there are two phases relating to the declaration of a person as a ‘fit"
"and proper person’. They are –",""
"i.","Declaration of whether (a) a person to be appointed, elected or nominated"
"","as a Director of a bank (before such appointment, election or nomination)"
"","or  (b)  a  person  appointed,  elected  or  nominated  as  a  Director  (within  15"
"","days  of  such  appointment,  election  or  nomination),  is  a  ‘fit  and  proper"
"","person’ [Sec. 42(4)(a) & (b)]."
"ii.","Declaration  of  whether  a  person  functioning  as  a  Director  of  a  bank  has"
"","ceased to be a ‘fit and proper person’ [Section 42(4)(c) and 42(8)]."
