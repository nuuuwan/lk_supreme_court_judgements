"Petitioner  to  conduct  himself  in  terms  of  established  procedures  and  to"
"abide by banking norms of good governance."
"71. It is in this backdrop that the 7th Respondent wrote to the General Manager / CEO"
"of the LDBL on 24th March 2016 (“P13”) informing him that it had been decided ‘to"
"refuse the appointment of the Petitioner as the Chairman of the LDBL’. He has cited two"
"reasons for his decision. They being,  (i)  failure of the  Petitioner to comply  with"
"clause  3(5)(ix)  of Direction No. 12 of 2007 and  (ii) breaching  confidentiality and"
"thereby  acting  in  contravention  of  section  77  of  the  Banking  Act.  The  evidence"
"placed before this Court amply supports both those findings. Furthermore, the 7th"
"Respondent  has  presented  to  this  Court  adequate  evidence  in  support  of  his"
"contention  that  by  his  own  conduct  the  Petitioner  had  established  a  sufficient"
"evidential  basis  to  conclude  that  he  was  an  ‘unfit  and  improper’  person  to  be"
"permitted  to  continue  to  function  as  the  Chairman  /  a  Director  of  the  LDBL."
"However, what is it that the Director Bank Supervision is empowered to do under"
"such circumstances? According to section 42(8) of the Banking Act, the Director of"
"Bank  Supervision  is  required  to  submit  a  Report  regarding  the  matter  to  the"
"Monetary Board. The position of the 7th Respondent is that “7R7” was tantamount"
"to the Report contemplated  in section 42(8). Even if  “7R7” is recognised by this"
"Court to be the ‘Report’ provided for by section 42(8), on a consideration of such"
"Report, it is the Monetary Board that is empowered to declare that a Director of a"
"bank is not a ‘fit and proper person’, and direct the bank in writing to remove such"
"person from the office of Director within such period as may be specified in such"
"direction,  giving  reasons  for  such  direction,  and  notify  in  writing  such  person"
"whose removal is required under such direction, of such direction, a copy of which"
"shall be annexed to such notification. It would thus be seen that the terminology"
"contained in “P13” to the effect that “I write to inform you of the refusal of appointment"
"of Mr. Lasantha Goonewardena as the Chairman under the provisions of section 42(2) read"
"with section 76(H) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 as amended, due to the following"
"reasons” is flagrantly ultra vires the powers conferred on the 7th Respondent by the"
"Banking Act. In fact, the evidence does not disclose the 1st Respondent – Monetary"
"Board having dispatched its determination under section 42(8) of the Banking Act."
