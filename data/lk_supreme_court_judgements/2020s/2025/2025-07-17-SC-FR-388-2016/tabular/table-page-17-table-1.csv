"x.","Furthermore, under the provisions of the Banking Act, the jurisdiction of"
"","the DBS is limited to Directors and not to the Chairman of a bank. The DBS"
"","does  not  have  legal  authority  to  either  approve  the  appointment  of  or"
"","remove the Chairman of a bank. Therefore, the purported ‘removal’ of the"
"","Petitioner is ultra vires the powers vested in the 7th Respondent."
"xi.","What the 7th Respondent has done amounts to ‘removal’ of the Petitioner as"
"","the Chairman of the LDBL. He was not removed as a Director of the LDBL."
"","It  is  section  42(8)  of  the  Banking  Act  that  provides  for  the  ‘removal’  of a"
"","Director of a bank. However, the 7th Respondent has not acted in terms of"
"","section 42(8) (which provides for ‘removal’ of a Director of a bank after the"
"","initial  appointment),  and  has  purportedly  acted  under  42(2)  read  with"
"","section 76H of the Banking Act."
"xii.","The  purported  reasons  given  by  the  7th  Respondent  for  the  decision"
"","contained 
in  “P13”  relates  to  the  Petitioner  having  functioned  as  the"
"","Chairman of the LDBL and not as a Director of that bank."
"xiii.","The  officials  of  the  CBSL  have  acted  in  bad  faith  by  imposing  retaliatory"
"","measures  against 
the  Petitioner 
in  view  of 
the 
regulatory 
failures"
"","highlighted by the Petitioner contained in “P16B” and “P16C”."
"xiv.","The  impugned  conduct  of  the  7th  Respondent  –  DBS  is  unreasonable,"
"","arbitrary and illegal."
"xv.","The 1st Respondent - MBSL which rejected the Appeal (“P19”) presented to"
"","it  by  the  Petitioner,  has  not  properly  considered  the  grounds  of  Appeal"
"","contained 
in  “P19”.  Further,  prior 
to 
rejecting 
the  Appeal, 
the  1st"
"","Respondent did not afford the Petitioner a fair hearing. Therefore,  the 1st"
"","Respondent has acted in violation of the rules of natural justice."
"xvi.","The 
impugned  decisions 
infringe 
the  Petitioner’s 
fundamental  rights"
"","guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution."
