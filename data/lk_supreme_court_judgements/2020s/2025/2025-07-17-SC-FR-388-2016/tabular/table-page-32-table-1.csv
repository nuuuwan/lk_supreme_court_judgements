"ii.","The Report of the special investigation  (“7R7”) was considered by the 7th"
"","Respondent.  The  Report  revealed  the  following  (among  several  other"
"","findings) regarding the Petitioner:"
"","a.  That  he  had  engaged  in  direct  supervision  of  key  management"
"","personnel."
"","b.  That he had got involved in other executive duties such as approving"
"","credit  facilities  (despite  the  absence  of  a  delegated  authority)  to"
"","borrowers depicting adverse status, authorising imprudent changes"
"","to  interest rates  and  conditions  proposed  by  the  management  and"
"","approving recruitments deviating from internal procedures."
"","c.  That  he  had  recommended 
the  grant  of 
facilities 
to 
ineligible"
"","persons, contrary to the approved Credit Policy and Manual."
"","d.  That  he  had  instructed  the  management  to  recruit  staff  deviating"
"","from the internal recruitment and promotion procedure."
"","e.  That he had made amendments to the Minutes of a Staff Committee"
"","meeting, even though he was not a member of that Committee."
"","f. 
That  he  along  with 
the  Working  Director  had 
taken  part 
in"
"","deliberations on additional facilities to be provided and revisions of"
"","payments to themselves."
"","An examination of  “7R7” reveals that these allegations of misconduct on"
"","the part of the Petitioner are well-founded."
"iii.","At its meeting held on 18th December 2015, the 1st Respondent – Monetary"
"","Board  of  Sri  Lanka  had  considered  the  Report  relating  to  the  special"
"","investigation of the LDBL carried out by the DBS, and had inter alia decided"
"","to inform the Minister of Finance of the serious supervisory concerns the"
"","DBS  had  with  regard 
to 
the  Petitioner 
(who  had  been  purportedly"
"","appointed by the Minister of Finance) and inform the Minister that due to"
"","the Petitioner’s conduct, he would have to be declared as unfit  (not a ‘fit"
"","and proper person’) to hold a position in the LDBL’s Board. It is the view"
"","of this Court that, the procedure adopted by the 1st Respondent - Monetary"
"","Board of Sri Lanka is not provided for in the Banking Act or the Regulations"
"","made thereunder. There was no basis for the 1st Respondent to have sought"
"","the 
intervention  of 
the  Minister  of  Finance 
in 
this  matter. 
If 
the  1st"
"","Respondent was of the view that the Petitioner had engaged in misconduct,"
"","the  1st  Respondent  should  have  acted  in  terms  of  the  provisions  of  the"
"","Banking Act and arrived at a determination on whether the Petitioner had"
"","ceased to be a ‘fit and proper person’."
"iv.","By letter dated 18th January 2016 (“7R5”), the then Governor of the Central"
"","Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  Arjuna  Mahendran  wrote  to  the  Minister  of  Finance"
