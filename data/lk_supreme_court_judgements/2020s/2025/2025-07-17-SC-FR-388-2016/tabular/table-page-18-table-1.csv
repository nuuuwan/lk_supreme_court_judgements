"i.","Since the LDBL is a licensed specialised bank, in terms of the Banking Act,"
"","it is subject to regulation by both the Monetary Board and the Director of"
"","Banking Supervision of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka."
"ii.","The authority given to the Secretary to the Treasury (in his capacity as the"
"","sole  shareholder)  to  appoint  Directors  to  the  LDBL, 
is  subject  to  the"
"","provisions  of  the  Banking  Act.  Though  the  Memorandum  of  Association"
"","(MoA) of the LDBL empowers the Secretary to the Treasury to appoint and"
"","remove Directors of the LDBL, by virtue of the provisions of the Banking"
"","Act, that power of appointment is subject to the provisions of the Banking"
"","Act. Article 73 of the MoA empowers the Secretary to the Treasury to also"
"","nominate the Chairman of the bank."
"iii.","In  this  instance,  the  Petitioner  had  been  purportedly  ‘appointed’  by  the"
"","Minister of Finance, which is in contravention of the provisions of the MoA."
"","Therefore,  the  purported  appointment  of  the  Petitioner  as  the  Chairman"
"","and as a Director of the LDBL was flawed."
"iv.","In  terms  of  the  Regulations  issued  under  the  Banking  Act,  the  Petitioner"
"","was  required  to  submit  a  Declaration  by  way  of  an  Affidavit  to  the  7th"
"","Respondent for him to be considered under section 42 of the Banking Act"
"","to be a ‘fit and proper’ person to hold office as a Director of the LDBL."
"v.","In  the  Petition  to  the  Supreme  Court,  the  Petitioner  has  taken  up  the"
"","position that this requirement was fulfilled by the submission of “P4” and"
"","“P4A”. Such Affidavit and the Declaration submitted were contrary to the"
"","provisions of section 42(4)(b) of the Banking Act, in that, they had not been"
"","submitted  within  15  days  of  the  Petitioner’s  appointment.  Furthermore,"
"","drawing the attention of this Court to  “7R1”, the learned DSG submitted"
"","that the said Affidavit was contrary to law due to the fact that, while the"
"","Petitioner claims to have signed it on 6th March 2015, the Justice of Peace"
"","R.S.  Pandithasekera  who  has  purportedly  attested  the  signature  of  the"
"","Petitioner as having been signed in his presence, has certified the Affidavit"
"","on 22nd April 2015. Therefore, that Affidavit was not valid as it contravened"
"","sections 12(2) and 12(3) of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance, No. 09 of"
"","1895 (as amended)."
"vi.","Following the request made in June 2015 by the DBS to re-submit the said"
"","Affidavit  and  the  declaration,  on  17th  July  2015,  the  Petitioner  submitted"
"","another Affidavit which indicated that it had been signed and attested on"
"","11th  February  2015.  That  is  the  Affidavit  (P4)  which  the  Petitioner  has"
"","presented to this Court along with “P4A”."
