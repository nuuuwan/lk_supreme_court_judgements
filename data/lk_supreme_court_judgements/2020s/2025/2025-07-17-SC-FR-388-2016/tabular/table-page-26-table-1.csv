"","quite  rightly  that  the  ‘fit  and  proper  test’  is  a  requirement  that  ensures  that"
"","Directors of banks and Senior Executive officers are suitable persons to carry-out"
"","their duties. It is the view of this Court that ‘suitability’ arises out of two aspects:"
"","the persons being ‘competent’ and them being persons with ‘integrity’. Given the"
"","complexity of banking operations and their impact on the financial markets, the"
"","overall financial sector, economy of the country and the interests of the customers"
"","and other transacting parties of banks, those at the level of the Board of Directors"
"","and  key  management  personnel  must  be  persons  with  (i)  a  high  degree  of"
"","competence, as reflected by their qualifications, (ii) previous work exposure and"
"","(iii)  experience.  Furthermore,  they  must  be  persons  of  high  integrity,  moral"
"","standing  and  unblemished  reputation.  It  is  for  this  purpose  that  section  42(2)"
"","contains certain criteria based upon which the Director of Bank Supervision may"
"","determine  whether  a  particular  individual  is  a  ‘fit  and  proper  person’  to  be"
"","appointed or function as a Director of a bank. Permitting a person who has lost his"
"","‘fit and proper’ status to remain to function as a Director of a bank would be most"
"","undesirable and contrary to the interest of all stakeholders of banks and the Sri"
"Lanka’s public interest.",""
"57. Seeking  clearance  from","the  Director  Bank  Supervision  on  behalf  of 
the"
"","Petitioner that he is a ‘fit and proper person’ to function as a Director – It was by"
"","letter dated 30th April 2015 (“P4A”) that the General Manager / Chief Executive"
"","Officer  of  the  LDBL  Lasantha  Amarasekara,  sought  the  clearance  of  the  7th"
"","Respondent  –  DBS  for  inter  alia  the  Petitioner,  to  be  declared  a  ‘fit  and  proper"
"","person’ to hold office as a Director of the LDBL. [I have previously dealt with the"
"","necessity  of  such  clearance  to  be  obtained  for  the  purpose  of  a  person  to  be"
"","appointed, elected, or nominated as a Director, or to continue to hold office as a"
"","Director of a licensed specialised bank.] Though “P4A” does not make a specific"
"","reference to that effect, as stated in the Petitioner’s Affidavit, it was agreed during"
"the  hearing  that,","it  was  for  that  purpose  that  “P4A”  had  been  dispatched."
"","Furthermore, the 7th Respondent has also viewed “P4A” as having been submitted"
"","for that purpose. Thus, the purpose for which “P4A” was submitted is clear."
