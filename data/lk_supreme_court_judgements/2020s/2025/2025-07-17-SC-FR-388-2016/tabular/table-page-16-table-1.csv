"","Petitioner (affirmant) having placed his signature and the Justice of Peace"
"","having attested the signature, that is not a defect that may be attributed to"
"","the Petitioner. If at all, the defect arises from the conduct of the Justice of"
"","Peace R.S. Pandithasekera by not having certified the Petitioner’s Affidavit"
"","correctly."
"v.","The Petitioner satisfies the requisite criteria to be declared a ‘fit and proper’"
"","person, as contained in sections 42(2)(a) to (i) of the Banking Act. The DBS"
"","has  never  considered  and  decided  that  the  Petitioner  was  not  a  ‘fit  and"
"","proper’ person to function as a Director of the LDBL."
"vi.","In view of the foregoing, it must be deemed that the Petitioner had been"
"","duly appointed as a Director of the LDBL and had thereby been properly"
"","appointed as the Chairman of the bank."
"vii.","The Petitioner is challenging the decisions contained in (i) “P13” (sent by"
"","the 7th Respondent - Director, Bank Supervision, CBSL) stating that he was"
"","refusing to ‘appoint’ the Petitioner as the Chairman of the LDBL, and (ii)"
"","“P20” (sent by the 9th Respondent – Secretary to the MBSL, CBSL) stating"
"","that  the  MBSL  had  decided  to  refuse  both  Appeals  of  the  Petitioner"
"","contained in “P18” and “P19”. However, what is in effect being challenged"
"","in these proceedings is the ‘removal’ of the Petitioner from functioning as"
"","the Chairman / Director of LDBL. There is no provision in the Banking Act"
"","which authorises the 7th Respondent to refuse to ‘appoint’ and/or ‘remove’"
"","a person as the Chairman of a bank. The position of ‘Chairman’ is distinct"
"","from  the  position  of  ‘Director’.  The  methods  for  the  appointment  and"
"","removal of a Director are different to those of a Chairman."
"viii.","The  request  of  the  LDBL  to  grant  approval  for  the  appointment  of  the"
"","Petitioner as a Director of the said bank, comes within section 42(4)(b) and"
"","section 42(8) of the Banking Act, since approval of the 7th Respondent – DBS"
"","was sought after the appointment of the Petitioner as a Director and as the"
"","Chairman of the LDBL. In the circumstances, prior to the issue of “P13”, the"
"","7th  Respondent  should  have  followed  the  procedure  prescribed  therein,"
"","which he has not done in the instant occasion. If at all, the removal should"
"","have  been  in  terms  of  section  42(8)(a)  by  the  1st  Respondent  –  Monetary"
"","Board of Sri Lanka. On that ground too, “P13” is ultra vires the powers of"
"","the 
7th  Respondent. 
  Therefore, 
the 
7th  Respondent  has 
acted 
in"
"","contravention of sections 42(4)(b), 42(6) and 42(8) of the Banking Act."
"ix.","The 7th Respondent has wrongfully acted in terms of sections 42(4)(a) and"
"","42(5) of the Banking Act."
