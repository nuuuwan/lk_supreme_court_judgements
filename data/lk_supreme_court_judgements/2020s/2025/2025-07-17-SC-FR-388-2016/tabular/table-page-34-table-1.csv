"Conclusions",""
"","72. As pointed out above, the following factors cannot be overlooked by this Court:"
"i.","That the purported appointment of the Petitioner as a Director of the LDBL"
"","was flawed and hence it is not possible to recognise that the Petitioner had"
"","ever been lawfully appointed as the Chairman or as a Director of the LDBL."
"ii.","A  serious  doubt  arises  regarding 
the 
integrity  of 
the  documentation"
"","submitted to the 7th Respondent on behalf of the Petitioner pertaining to the"
"","LDBL seeking the clearance under section 42(4) of the Banking Act that the"
"","Petitioner is a ‘fit and proper person’. Thus, the Petitioner has not shown"
"","uberrima fides towards this Court."
"iii.","The  Petitioner’s  conduct  during  the  period  he  purportedly  conducted"
"","himself as the Chairman and a Director of the LDBL had been irresponsible,"
"","dangerous and is in flagrant violation of the provisions of the Banking Act"
"","and Direction No. 12 of 2007."
