"the custody one part and it cannot be found after his death, the presumption"
"of 
law  is  that  he  destroyed  it  animus  revocandi”.   The  7th  Respondent"
"submitted  that based on the evidence the Last Will could be traced back to"
"the Testator."
"T
he  7th  Respondent  further  submitted  that  the  first  set  of  issues  of  the"
"Defendant  were 
framed  on  the  basis  that  the  Last  Will 
is 
fraudulent."
"However  as  the  Appellant  did  not  produce  the  original,  the  Respondents"
"raised  an  additional  issue  based  on  the  evidence  led  by  the  Appellant,"
"namely  that:  “whether  without  producing  the  original  of  the  Last  Will,  the"
"Petitioner could maintain the action”."
"T
he  7th  Respondent  submitted,  relying  on  Pure  Beverages  Ltd  v  Shanil"
"Fernando  [1997]  3  Sri  LR  202  that  issues  need  not  be  raised  in  the"
"pleadings. 
In 
the 
circumstances 
that 
the 
Defendant 
raised 
the"
"consequential issues and then dropped the other issues the court answered"
"those issues against the Appellant."
"T
he 9th Respondent in his further written submissions, stated that proving"
"the existence of the purported Last Will at the time of death of the Testator"
"rests on the party who seeks to assert on it and in this instance the burden"
"of  proof 
in 
terms  of  section  101  of  the  evidence  ordinance 
is  on  the"
"Appellant."
"T
he  9th  Respondent  further  submitted  that the law can be summarised as"
"follows:  a.  The  Last  Will  must  be  shown  to  have  been  in  the  possession of"
"the  Testator,  b.  The  Last  Will  is  not  forthcoming  upon  the  death  of  the"
"Testator, c. Then it is presumed to have been destroyed animo revocandi."
