n Vanderbona v Justin Perera [1985] 2 Sri LR 65 it was held that “The"
"rule regulating the burden of proof is contained in sections 101 to 103 of the"
"Evidence Ordinance’. ""The true meaning-of the rule."" states Monir in the Law"
"of  Evidence,  5th  Ed.  page""400,  in  regard  to  those  sections  of  the  Indian"

that he who asks the court to believe in the existence of a certain fact or set"
"of  facts,  must  prove  that  fact or set of facts exist. Non-existence of a fact is"
"as much a fact as the existence of a fact and, therefore, the non-existence of"
"a  fact  is  as  much  within  the  meaning  of  sections  103  and  101  as  the"
"existence of a fact. Thus interpreted, these two sections of the Evidence Act"
"may  be  taken  to  lay  down  the  general  rule  that  where  a  given  allegation,"
"whether affirmative or negative, forms an essential part of a party's case,the"
"proof  of  such  allegation  rests  on  such  party,  and  that  is  how  the  rule  is"
"stated  in  the  English  Cases  ""...........  Monir  then  elaborates  it  as  follows  :"
"“the  rule applicable to all such cases is that where a claim or defence rests"
"upon  a  negative  allegation,  the  one  asserting  such  claim  or  defence  is  not"
"relieved of the onus probandi by, reason of the form of the allegation, or the"
"inconvenience of proving:a negative. Where in order to show a right to relief,"
"it  becomes  necessary  for  a  party,  under.the  substantive  law,  to  prove  the"
"non-existence  of  a  fact,  the burden of proving such 'negative allegation' will"
"be  on  him  ...........  and  indeed,  in  every  case  in  which  the plaintiff grounds"
"his  right  of  action  upon  a  negative  allegation  and the establishment of this"
"negative is consequently an essential element in support of his claim.”"
