"the  Last  Will  is  the  wife  of  the  purported 2nd Marriage. She should have"
"known  the  date  of  marriage  and  the  certificate  of  marriage  should  have"
"been  available  with  her.  Thus,  there  was  every  possibility  to  tender"
"acceptable evidence as to the date of marriage during the hearing. It itself"
"is  a  ground  not  to  accept  new evidence in appeal â€“ vide Beatrice Dep v"
"Lalani Meemaduwa (1997) 3 Sri L R 379 and Ratwatte v Bandara 70 N"
"L  R  231.  On  the other hand, there must be proper application to tender"
"fresh evidence while giving an opportunity for the other side to oppose to"
"it.  After  considering  the  application,  the  Appellate  Court  may  have  to"
"decide  the  mode  of  producing  the  fresh  evidence  as  mere  producing  a"
"document  without  an  opportunity  giving  to  the  opposite  party  will  open"
"gates  to  unverified,  untested  documents  to  be  considered  as  evidence"
"causing  irreparable  harm to the opposite party. Even a bogus document"
"may  come  in  as evidence by allowing such documents without giving an"
"opportunity  for  the  opposite  party  to  challenge  it  in  a  proper  manner."
"Thus, in my view this Court should not consider said marriage certificate"
"filed during the appeal. However, as per evidence, it is indicated that this"
"second  marriage  took  place  before  the  divorce  action  was  concluded"
"between  the  Testator  and  the  first  wife.  If  so,  there  cannot  be  a  valid"
"marriage. 
It 
is  said  that  the  second  marriage  was  done  in  terms  of"
"Muslim 
law. 
In  Natalie  Abeysundere  v  Christopher  Abeysundere"
"(1997)  1  Sri  L  R  26  it  was  held  that  the  marriage  contracted  under"
"Muslim  Law  is  null  and  void  unless  the  first  marriage  is  dissolved  in"
"terms  of 
the  Roman  Dutch  Law.  Thus, 
in 
fact  there 
is  no  second"
"marriage  before  law  proved  before  the Courts below to consider that the"
"Last Will is repudiated by the second marriage."
