"Judge  held  that  there  was  no  forgery.  However,  the Learned District Court"
"Judge held that Last Will was null and void due to the subsequent marriage"
"in lieu of section 6 of the Prevention of Frauds ordinance."
"T
he Learned President’s Counsel for the 7th Respondent submitted that the"
"duly executed Last Will of the deceased was not produced at the trial."
"The  Learned  President’s Counsel submitted that the Court accepts as valid"
"a  Last  Will  on  protocol  and  grants  probate  on  the  same  contingent  on  the"
"fact  that  the  original  Last  Will  has  been  proved  and  the  Original  Last  Will"
"must be proved in order to remove suspicion."
"R
elying  on  section  6  of  the  Prevention  of  Frauds  Ordinance,  the  Learned"
"President’s  Counsel  submitted  that,  when the Last Will can be traced back"
"to  the  Testator  at  the  time  of  death, but cannot be found after the death a"
"presumption  arises  that  the  Last  Will  has  been  destroyed  by  the  Testator."
"This presumption can be rebutted, however it has not been rebutted in this"
"case and thus it is contended that the Last Will was destroyed."
"T
he Learned Counsel for the 9th Respondent stated that where the Last Will"
"can be traced to the Testator and where the Last Will cannot be found with"
"the  Testator  at the time of death, the presumption arises that the Last Will"
"has been destroyed. Such presumption can be rebutted through evidence."
"C
iting  Bertram  CJ,  the  Learned  Counsel  submitted  that  there  are  two"
"elements  for  this  principle  to  apply,   1.  that  the  Last Will cannot be found"
"and  2.  Has  the  Last  Will been in the possession of the Testator at the time"
"of  death?  According  to  evidence  led  at  trial  by  one  Sirisena,  it  has  been"
"12"
