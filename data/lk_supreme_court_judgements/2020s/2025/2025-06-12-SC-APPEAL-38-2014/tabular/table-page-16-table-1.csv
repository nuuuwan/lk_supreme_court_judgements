"Perusing  the  judgement  of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  the  Honourable  Justice  of"
"the  Court  of  Appeal  has  held  that  the 7th Respondent objected to the Last"
"Will  mainly  on two grounds. That the deceased had destroyed the Last Will"
"and  drew  inferences  in  favour  of  the  presumption  that  the  Last  Will  was"
"destroyed  as  the  Testator  did  not  intend  to  give  effect  to  it,  and  that  the"
"Testator had married after the Last Will was executed and pleaded section 6"
"of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance. However in perusal of the Record of"
"the trial at the District Court the issues raised by the Respondents relate to"
"forgery and consequently on the maintainability of the action based on non"
"submission of the Original of the Last Will to court. Consequently two other"
"issues were raised regarding the application of section 6 of the Prevention of"
"Frauds  Ordinance  relating  to  contracting  of  the  second  marriage  by  the"
"Testator and not regarding the revocation by destruction of the Last Will."
