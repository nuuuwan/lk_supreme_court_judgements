"I
t is the 7th Respondent who raised two additional issues regarding the date"
"of the second marriage of the Testator which invalided the Last Will and the"
"application of section 6 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, as such the"
"onus  on  proving  the  same  lies  with  the  7th  Respondent.  However,  the  7th"
"Respondent  has  not  led  any  evidence  at  trial  and  failed  to  discharge  the"
"burden cast upon her."
"In  any  event,  as  correctly  asserted  by  the  Learned  President's  Counsel  for"
"the  Appellant,  the  Testator's  divorce  proceedings  with  the  7th  Respondent"
"had  not  been  finalised  at  the  time  he  entered  into  marriage  with  the  8th"
"Respondent  under  Muslim  Law.  Consequently,  the  second  marriage  was"
"inherently invalid."
"This  position  has  been  firmly  established  by  a five-judge bench decision of"
"the  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of  Natalie  Abeysundere  v  Christopher"
"Abeysundere  and  Another  [1991]  1 Sri LR at page 26 which held that a"
"marriage  contracted  under  Muslim  Law  is  null  and  void  unless  the  first"
"marriage is dissolved in terms of the Roman Dutch Law."
"Based  on  the  above, the second marriage of the Testator was invalid in the"
"eyes  of  the  law  and  had  no bearing on the validity of the Last Will No 962."
"When  considering  all  the  circumstances  discussed  above, it is evident that"
"the  Appellant  in  the  present  case  has  correctly  proved  the  validity  of  the"
"purported  Last  Will.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Respondents  have  failed  to"
"bring conclusive evidence to defend their position."
