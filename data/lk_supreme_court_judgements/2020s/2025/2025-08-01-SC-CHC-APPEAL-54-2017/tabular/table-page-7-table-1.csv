"Having  considered  and  analysed  the  evidence  placed  before  the  Court,  the"
"learned High Court Judge has come to a finding that the evidence of the 1st"
"defendant cannot be relied upon as to the manner the transaction occurred,"
"for which I have no reason to disagree."
"The  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  also  considered  the  stand  of  the  1st"
"defendant where he has claimed that he never signed the agreement marked"
"P-01, but only signed the contract he marked as V-01."
"The learned High Court Judge has drawn his attention to the fact that the 1st"
"defendant,  who  claims  that  the  document  marked  P-01  was  a  fraudulent"
"document, has failed to take any steps to establish that fact before the Court."
"Having considered the contents of P-01 and V-01, it has been determined that"
"both  the  documents  have  been  signed  for  the  same  purpose  of  supplying"
"copper as stated by the plaintiff, and the document marked P-01 was the soft"
"offer  letter,  and  V-01  was  the  sales  agency  agreement  entered  between  the"
"plaintiff as the agent of his fatherâ€™s company in Korea and the 1st defendant."
"It has been determined that since at the time of signing the said document,"
"the company which the 1st defendant claims that he represented was not in"
"existence, the 1st defendant has entered into the agreement in his personal"
"capacity."
"The learned High Court Judge has also made a note of the fact that when the"
"1st  defendant  was  arrested  and  produced  before  the  Magistrate  Court  in"
"relation to a complaint lodged by the plaintiff to the police of this transaction"
"on the basis that a fraud has been committed, at no point the 1st defendant"
"has  claimed  that  the  documents  produced  by  the  plaintiff  to  the  police  are"
"fraudulent documents."
"The  argument  that  the  plaintiff  has  no  locus  standi  to  institute  an  action"
"against  the  defendants  as  argued  before  this  Court  has  also  been  a  matter"
"considered by the learned High Court Judge in his judgment."
