"plaintiff to run a business in Sri Lanka. He has also claimed that he did not"
"know  what  the  business  was,  but  has  stated  that  after  he  signed  the"
"document, he came to know that the business was a one related to copper."
"In the impugned judgment, it is manifestly clear that the learned Judge of the"
"Commercial High Court has considered the evidence placed before the Court"
"by both  the parties in its totality in order to come to a finding whether the"
"plaintiff  has  established  his  case,  or  whether  the  defendantâ€™s  stand  should"
"succeed.  With  that  in  mind,  the  learned  trial  Judge  has  considered  the"
"evidence  in  the  balance  of  probabilities,  which  is  the  standard  of  proof"
"required in a civil suit."
"In view of the undisputed fact that the 1st defendant received a sum equivalent"
"to USD 96,000 to his account, and also the undisputed fact that no export of"
"copper  has  taken  place,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  has  proceeded  to"
"consider the evidence in that context, being mindful of the issues raised by"
"the parties, while reaching his conclusions."
"In this process, the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence of"
"the 1st defendant where he has claimed that he had no knowledge of exporting"
"copper to South Korea when the money was remitted to his account, but went"
"on the belief  that it  was only to facilitate the plaintiff to have money in Sri"
"Lanka to conduct his business."
"However, as correctly observed by the learned High Court Judge, the answer"
"of the 1st defendant filed in Court was in complete contrast to the stand taken"
"by him in his evidence. In his answer, he has taken up the position that he"
"agreed to act as an intermediary on behalf of the Sri Lankan company Vilasa"
"Oseas PLC, where he was a director, and the plaintiff, who acted as an agent"
"of the Korean company in order to supply 15 tonnes of copper locally. It has"
"been  claimed  that  he  reached  an  agreement  only  in  that  regard  with  the"
"Korean company."
