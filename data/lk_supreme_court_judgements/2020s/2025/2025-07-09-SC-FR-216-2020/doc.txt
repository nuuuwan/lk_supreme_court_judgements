Argued on: 27/03/2025

Decided on: 09/07/2025

A. L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

Factual Background

1. By Petition and Affidavit dated 13/07/2020, the Petitioners are before this

Court for an alleged incident of ragging which took place on 06/03/2020,

during a social event organized by the senior students to mark the

conclusion of the ragging period for first-year students at the University

of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte. The events of that night led to the 2nd

Petitioner, Jayasinghe Arachchige Pasindu Hirushan Silva, sustaining

8

grievous injuries, and presently in a stage of recovery. This incident is the

subject of proceedings preferred before the Magistrates Court of

Gangodawila under Case No. 1245/2020.

2. By this Petition, the Petitioners seek a just and equitable relief for the

injuries suffered by the 2nd Petitioner while also advocating for systemic

accountability to prevent future ragging incidents. By holding the

Respondents accountable for their acts of negligence, the Petitioners aim

to safeguard university students from similar harm and ensure a ragging-

free educational environment.

3. The 2nd Petitioner was enrolled as a first-year student of the Faculty of

Management Studies and Commerce in December, 2019. He also pursued

his academic aspirations in Chartered Accountancy. Known for his

involvement in sports and aesthetic studies, he was determined to fund his

education independently. However, due to the serious injuries sustained

on the night of the incident, he was incapable of personally signing the

Petition; therefore, was compelled to prefer this Petition through the 1st

Petitioner, Jayasingha Arachchige Shermila Priyadarshani Silva, Attorney-

at-Law, his elder sister.

4. The Petitioners assert that ragging, despite being prohibited under Sri

Lankan law, remains a deeply ingrained practice within the university

culture, particularly in the weeks following a new intake. The incident in

question took place in the early hours of 06/03/2020, during a welcome

party organized by the senior students. Amidst the celebrations, a large

backhoe tyre was rolled down a flight of stairs, striking the 2nd Petitioner,

standing at the bottom of the staircase. The resulting impact caused him to

be thrown a considerable distance away from where he was, leading to

severe head and chest injuries, including fractures to the skull and brain

trauma, resulting in retrograde amnesia and partial paralysis.

9

5. Following the incident, the 2nd Petitioner was immediately rushed to

Colombo South Teaching Hospital and, due to the gravity of his injuries, he

was later transferred to the National Hospital, Colombo. He remained in

intensive care for over three months, undergoing multiple surgeries to

address haemorrhage and fractures. His recovery has required extensive

physiotherapy, including chest therapy, limb rehabilitation, speech

therapy, and occupational therapy. Despite these medical interventions,

the extent of his long-term recovery remains uncertain, raising concerns

about his ability to resume a normal life.

6. Through the Petition, the Petitioners seek judicial intervention to ensure

accountability and justice. They emphasize that this case not only concerns

the personal grievances of the 2nd Petitioner, but also has broader

implications for university students at large. The Petition urges

institutional reforms and heightened oversight to prevent future instances

of ragging that could disrupt the lives of young students seeking to pursue

higher education.

7. The Petitioners assert that the University Administration, despite granting

permission for the social event on 05/03/2020, failed to ensure

compliance with the stipulated conditions. The administration had

mandated that the event conclude by 10:00 p.m. and explicitly prohibited

the prevalence of alcohol within university premises. However, these

restrictions were not adequately enforced. The lack of oversight resulted in

alcohol being brought onto campus premises, leading to intoxication

among some of the students, including individuals involved in the incident

that caused severe injuries sustained to the 2nd Petitioner. Moreover, the

event continued past midnight, far beyond the permitted time, highlighting

a lapse in supervisory measures.

8. Following the incident, six students from the University of Sri

Jayewardenepura were arrested and produced before the Magistrates

10

Court of Gangodawila on 11/03/2020. The Petitioners acknowledge that

these proceedings remain pending, and it is acknowledged in the Petition

that the accused students are currently enlarged on bail.

9. Given the totality of the circumstances outlined in the Petition, the 1st

Petitioner submits that the 2nd Petitioners Fundamental Right to Equality

and Equal Protection under Article 12(1) of the Constitution has been

violated.

Expansion of Proceedings and Inclusion of Additional Respondents

10. On 24/01/2022, this Court was inclined to grant Leave to Proceed under

Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Affidavit and the supporting

documents of the 2nd Respondent were filed on 30/11/2022.

11. By Order dated 08/06/2023, the Court held that; although, Leave to

Proceed was granted in this matter and the matter was fixed for hearing,

taking into consideration the issues involved, exercising its powers vested

in the Supreme Court in terms of Article 126(4), the Court was of the view

that the scope of this application should be expanded so that effective

remedies can be considered and appropriate orders made.

12. The 2nd Petitioner, clearly a victim of an act of ragging, has sustained

serious injuries due to that act. Ragging has been identified to cause a

series of adverse consequences in university education, primarily physical,

physiological, and behavioral changes, and is identified as a cause for an

increasing number of university drop-outs. Having realized the gravity and

the urgent attention it requires, the Court inquired from the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners and the learned Deputy Solicitor

General Dr. Avanti Perera representing some of the Respondents, whether

an expansion of the scope of this application is necessitated particularly,

given the relief prayed for in paragraph e of the Petition which reads thus;

11

Declare through order of Your Lordships Court guidelines to be

implemented and enforced through the 1st Respondent Commission to all

National State Universities under the 1st Respondent Commission.

13. Given this prayer, the Court was of the view that Vice Chancellors of all

Universities that came under the University Grants Commission [UGC]

(the 1st Respondent) should be made Added Respondents in terms of

Section 34(2) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 (as amended).

Accordingly, the Vice-Chancellors of the following Universities that come

within the purview of the UGC were added as Respondents to this

Application, i.e.;

(1) University of Colombo

(2) University of Vavuniya

(3) Eastern University

(4) University of Jaffna

(12) South-Eastern University

(13) University of Uva Wellassa

(14) University of Visual and Performing Arts

(15) University of Wayamba

(16) Gampaha Wickramaarachchi University of Indigenous Medicine

14. The said Added Respondents were directed to submit a report to this

Court within 8 weeks from the date of Order, on all measures presently in

place in their respective Universities to curb and curtail instances of

12

Ragging, and such report also to contain the complaints received by the

respective Universities of all incidents of Ragging during the past 3 years,

and the follow up remedial steps taken by such University in that regard.

15. This Court also directed the Petitioners to add the Inspector General of

Police as the 23rd Added Respondent. The Inspector General of Police was

directed to submit a report within 8 weeks from the date of the said Order,

on investigations conducted by the Sri Lanka Police concerning instances

of Ragging and the action taken under The Prohibition of Ragging and

Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act No. 20 of 1998,

on all pending cases filed under that Act.

16. In addition, it was brought to the attention of this Court that in terms of

Sections 19 and 20 of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978, it is incumbent

on the Minister of Higher Education to issue directions on university

education to the UGC (the 1st Respondent), and such general and written

directions as deemed necessary, in pursuance of National Policy. In the

circumstances, the Minister of Higher Education was added as a

Respondent.

17. The Petitioners filed an Amended Caption adding the Added Respondents

as per the Order dated 08/06/2023.

18. On 29/08/2023, the Acting Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri

Jayawardenepura (3rd Respondent), along with his affidavit, filed the

Disciplinary Committee report relating to the incident where the 2nd

Petitioner, Pasindu Hirushan, had sustained serious injuries (3R1). On

page 07 of the said report, which refers to extracts of the statement made

by the injured student, reveals that the freshers were subjected to assault

by the senior students, specifically the students staying in residential halls.

13

19. The Court directed the Vice Chancellor (Acting) of University of Sri

Jayawardenepura (3rd Respondent) and the Dean of Faculty of

Management Studies and Commerce of University of Sri Jayawardenepura

(4th Respondent) to submit a detailed report as to what action was taken by

them to identify and take disciplinary action against the senior students

who had engaged in ragging the freshers as revealed by the 2nd Petitioner.

In case no such action had been taken up to now, the said Respondents

were directed to set out reasons for such lapse. The annexures to the

affidavit of the 2nd Respondent, marked and produced as 2R7A, 2R7B, and

2R7C, refer to relief recommended by the Ragging Relief Committee. The

2nd Respondent was directed to submit a detailed report on the nature of

ragging of the students referred to in the said statements and the action

taken by the 2nd Respondent or the competent authority of the relevant

University regarding the students who engaged in ragging the students

referred to in the said documents. The 2nd Respondent was further directed

to submit details of disciplinary action taken against the students regarding

the offences referred to in page xiv of Schedule 2 of the UGC Circular no.

946 dated 10/02/2011 (2R4).

Judicial Review of Institutional Effectiveness in Formulating Anti-

Ragging Guidelines / Directives / Circulars for Higher Educational

Institutions

21. The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that what

the Petitioners are seeking from this Court is not a declaration on the

violation of the Petitioners rights but directions and guidelines on the

respective Universities and the UGC to ensure that any future occurrence

of ragging would be addressed efficiently and effectively and take necessary

steps to ensure elimination of Ragging from Universities as provided by

law.

22. The learned Counsel for the added Respondents were of the view that even

though the universities had taken necessary action keeping with the anti-

ragging protocol in certain instances, the assistance extended by the law

enforcement authorities in such instances was not forthcoming or efficient

and effective. Therefore, it is necessary to have the law enforcement

authorities also be apprised of the importance of this matter.

23. Accordingly, the Court directed the Hon. Attorney General to initiate a

discussion with the UGC, inclusive of all the added Respondent universities

as well as the law enforcement agencies, to review all existing guidelines,

circulars and with the agreement of all universities, tender to Court

consolidated and comprehensive guidelines to deal with ragging efficiently

and effectively. All the Respondents who are named in these proceedings

were directed to actively participate in this process and to liaise with the

UGC in developing such guidelines.

24. On 25/09/2024, the learned Deputy Solicitor General drew the attention

of this Court to the motion dated 13/09/2024, which was tendered to Court

along with the final Draft Guidelines marked as Z. The learned Deputy

Solicitor General further submitted that the draft was developed with the

21

consultation of all Universities, the University Grants Commission, the

law enforcement agencies, and the Ministry of Higher Education, as

directed by this Court. (Empasis is added.)

25. In the above circumstances, on 27/03/2025, the learned President's

Counsel for the Petitioners reiterated that he would not seek a declaration

on the violation of rights by the Respondents but would seek

guidelines/directions on the respective Universities to ensure the

elimination of ragging efficiently as provided by law. All Respondent

parties in principle agreed to this application and had no objections to this

Court initiating the necessary process to draft guidelines that were to be

tendered to this Court with the agreement of all relevant stakeholders.

26. Consequent to the above stand, the Hon. Attorney General, convened a

meeting on 09/07/2024 with the Vice Chancellors of all the Higher

Educational Institutions who are Respondents to this Application, as well

as representatives of the University Grants Commission (1st Respondent),

Sri Lanka Police (23B Respondent) and Minister of Higher Education (22B

Respondent), to pursue a consultative approach, to prepare the Draft

Guidelines to be formulated by the Hon. Attorney General. Upon receipt of

recommendations from the aforesaid parties, the Guidelines to Combat

Ragging in Higher Educational Institutions marked "Z3" was filed of

record by the Hon. Attorney General with notice to all parties.

27. The Guidelines to Combat Ragging in Higher Educational

Institutions (Z3) mandate every Higher Educational Institution [HEI],

to establish Victim Support and Anti-Ragging Committees, provide legal,

medical, and psychological support for victims, and enforce strict

disciplinary procedures against perpetrators and negligent staff. It also

makes sure that the HEIs ensure campus safety through surveillance, staff

training, and secure accommodation, while also addressing substance

abuse and cyberbullying.

22

Legal and Institutional Framework on Ragging: Systemic Failures in

Regulatory Mechanisms, and the Need for Effective Enforcement

28. Ragging in Sri Lankan Universities has led to devastating consequences,

including students abandoning their academic pursuits and, in extreme

cases, taking their own lives. Despite legal prohibitions and institutional

policies aimed at curbing ragging, the practice continues to inflict severe

psychological and physical harm on victims, often leaving them with no

viable recourse.

29. Many students subjected to ragging experience intense emotional distress,

leading to withdrawal from university education altogether. Victims often

struggle with anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress, making it

difficult for them to focus on their studies or integrate into campus life.

Some students, unable to cope with the trauma, choose to discontinue their

education, forfeiting their aspirations and future opportunities. Reports

indicate that students from urban backgrounds or those perceived as

socially or economically privileged are disproportionately targeted, further

exacerbating inequalities in higher education.

30. Systematic failure on the part of the universities in the implementation of

Anti-Ragging procedures can be clearly observed, given the reports

submitted by the respective universities. Despite the existence of various

policies and legal frameworks aimed at preventing ragging in Sri Lankan

universities, their implementation remains inconsistent and ineffective.

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued multiple directives,

including regulatory mechanisms and relief measures for victims of

ragging, having minimal or no avail.

31. In consequence of the inhumane incidents of ragging, several mechanisms

and commissions have been established over the years to combat and

prevent ragging in universities, such as;

23

The Presidential Committee to Probe Ragging (1997-1998), appointed

by the President, which investigated the causes and consequences of

ragging in universities, made several recommendations, including

strong disciplinary action, psychological counselling, and introducing

anti-ragging legislation;

The University Grants Commission Circulars No. 919 (2010), No. 946

(2011), No. 12/2019 (2019), and No. 04/2020 (2020);

The UGC Anti-Ragging Task Force, which aimed to coordinate with

universities on anti-ragging measures, investigate complaints, and

recommend disciplinary and legal action;

the UGC Standing Committee on Student Affairs, which monitored

student welfare,

Ministry of Higher Education initiatives on anti-ragging awareness

campaigns.

Redressing Victims of Ragging & Providing a Regulatory Mechanism

to Prevent Ragging Related Abusive Conduct in Sri Lankan State

Universities and Higher Educational Institutions, the Report of the

Committee appointed by the University Grants Commission, headed

by former Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Dr. Saleem Marsoof

PC, refers to the following reports;

o Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Ragging at the

Vidyalankara Campus of the University of Sri Lanka (also

known as the V. W. Kularatne Commission), Sessional Paper

SLP No. 24295 of 2006.

32. The Court is possessed of the above findings and has considered the various

measures taken and mechanisms adopted over the years to combat and

prevent ragging in universities. We have examined the structure,

implementation, and effectiveness of the said findings in addressing the

issues relating to implementation, institutional accountability, and student

safety.

33. The Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 (as amended) mandates the University

Grants Commission (UGC), the regulation of the administration of higher

educational institutions and matters connected therewith or incidental

thereto.

34. Circular No. 919, issued on 15/01/2010, outlines the various forms of

ragging occurring in Higher Education Institutions and provides measures

for prevention, procedural guidelines, and associated penalties. It also

introduces a 'Declaration' for new students, requiring them to sign an

affidavit, countersigned by a parent or guardian, affirming their

commitment to refrain from engaging in, assisting, or facilitating any form

of ragging or violence. Furthermore, the circular mandates the

establishment of an Anti-Ragging Committee, comprising the Vice

Chancellor, Deans, a Council Member, a nominee from the University

Grants Commission, the University Medical Officer, Student Counsellors,

and Sub-Wardens. This committee is required to convene at least twice a

month during high-risk periods and submit regular reports to the

University Council. The circular also mandates that all reported ragging

incidents be documented, either openly or confidentially, and reported to

the nearest Police Station and the University Grants Commission (UGC).

Additionally, it requires that victims be referred for medical or psychiatric

evaluation. The circular further encourages the submission of evidence and

25

written complaints concerning ragging, with provisions allowing

complaints to be filed on a confidential basis when necessary.

35. Circular No. 946, issued on 10/02/2011, establishes standardized

guidelines on student discipline, detailing procedures for disciplinary

action, appeals, and prescribed punishments. It grants the Vice Chancellor

broad authority to address misconduct, including initiating investigations,

gathering reports from staff, formulating charges, and enforcing

punishments as recommended by the Board of Discipline or Senate. The

circular outlines a comprehensive framework for handling disciplinary

matters, ensuring structured enforcement, with clear stipulations on the

maximum permissible penalties for violations.

36. Circular No. 12/2019, issued on 22/11/2019, mandates universities to

implement prescribed anti-ragging strategies and develop corresponding

By-laws while conducting awareness programs on the harmful effects of

ragging and Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV). Vice Chancellors

and Deans are tasked with ensuring student protection, with particular

focus on identifying first-semester students who have missed exams and

monitoring potential dropouts. Universities must collaborate with cleaning

staff and security personnel to gather intelligence on ragging activities,

while administrators are required to chair regular meetings with Wardens,

Proctors, Marshals, and Student Counsellors to enhance preventive

measures. Additionally, each university is instructed to form an Anti-

Ragging Committee led by the Vice Chancellor, with individual faculties

establishing their own committees headed by the Dean. These committees

are to include representatives from academic and non-academic staff,

proctors, marshals, student counsellors, and both new and senior students

to ensure comprehensive oversight and enforcement.

37. Circular No. 04/2020, issued on 10/08/2020, directs the university Vice

Chancellors to report complaints relating to ragging and Sexual and

26

Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) to the University Grants Commission

(UGC) within seven days of receiving them.

38. Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational

Institutions Act No. 20 of 1998 criminalizes ragging and prescribes severe

penalties.

39. Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the Prohibition of Ragging and Other

Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act No. 20 of 1998 read

thus:

2. (1) Any person who commits, or participates in, ragging, within or

outside an educational institution, shall be guilty of an offence under

this Act and shall on conviction after summary trial before a

Magistrate be liable, to rigorous imprisonment for a term not

exceeding two years and may also be ordered to pay compensation of

an amount determined by court, to the person in respect of whom the

offence was committed for the injuries caused to such person.

(2) A person who, whilst committing ragging causes sexual

harassment or grievous hurt to any student or a member of the staff,

of an educational institution shall be guilty of an offence under this Act

and shall on conviction after summary trial before a Magistrate be

liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years and may

also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by

court, to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for

the injuries caused to such person.

3. Any person who, within or outside an educational institution,

threatens, verbally or in writing, to cause injury to the person,

reputation or property of any student or a member of the staff, of an

educational institution (in this section referred to as "the victim") or to

the person, reputation or property of some other person in whom the

victim is interested, with the intention of causing fear in the victim or

27

of compelling the victim to do any act which the victim is not legally

required to do, or to omit to do any act which the victim is entitled to

do, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall on conviction

after summary trial before a Magistrate be liable to rigorous

imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

4. Any person who does any act, by which the personal liberty and the

freedom of movement of any student or a member of the staff of an

educational institution or other person within such educational

institution or any premises under the management and control of such

educational institution, is restrained without lawful justification and

for the purpose of forcing such student, member of the staff or person

to take a particular course of action, shall be guilty of an offence under

this Act and shall on conviction after summary trial before a

Magistrate, be liable to rigorous imprisonment for a term not

exceeding seven years.

5. Any person who unlawfully obstructs any student or a member of

the staff of an educational institution, in such a manner as to prevent

such student or member of the staff from proceeding in any direction

in which such student or member of the staff, has a right to proceed,

shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall on conviction after

summary trial before a Magistrate be liable to rigorous imprisonment

for a term not exceeding seven years.

6. Any person who unlawfully restrains any student or a member of

the staff of an educational institution in such a manner as to prevent

such student or member of the staff from proceeding beyond certain

circumscribing limits, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and

shall on conviction after summary trial before a Magistrate be liable

to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years.

28

7. (1) Any person who, without lawful excuse, occupies, by force, any

premises of, or under the management or control of, an educational

institution shall be guilty of an offence under this Act, and shall on

conviction after summary trial before a Magistrate be liable to

imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to a fine not

exceeding ten thousand rupees or to both such imprisonment and fine.

(2) Any person who causes mischief in respect of any property of, or

under the management or control of, an educational institution shall

be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall on conviction after

summary trial before a Magistrate he liable to imprisonment for a

term to not exceeding twenty years and a fine of five thousand rupees

or three times the amount of the loss or damage caused to such

property, which ever amount is higher.

8. Where a person is convicted of an offence under this Act, the court

may, having regard to the gravity of the offence__

(a) in any case where the person convicted is a student of an

educational institution, order that such person be expelled from such

institution;

(b) in any case where the person convicted is a member of the staff of

an educational institution, order that such person be dismissed from

such educational institution.

40. The Prohibition of Ragging Act establishes that ragging offences can be

committed against both students and staff, whether within or outside

educational institutions. The Act grants Magistrates the discretion to issue

an expulsion order for an undergraduate or dismiss a staff member found

guilty of such acts. Additionally, individuals accused of ragging involving

sexual harassment or hostage-taking can only be granted bail by the High

Court, as all offences under the Act are classified as cognizable, requiring

immediate legal intervention.

29

41. The Prohibition of Ragging Act imposes stricter penalties than those

prescribed for similar offenses in the Penal Code, underscoring the gravity

of ragging-related crimes. Additionally, perpetrators may face charges not

only under the Penal Code but also under the Convention Against Torture

and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Act,

No. 22 of 1994, depending on the nature of the offence.

42. However, despite the existence of numerous laws, regulations, and

circulars intended to prevent ragging-related suicides, permanent

disabilities, and psychological trauma among university students, the

failure to ensure due and timely enforcement of guidelines/directions has

enabled perpetrators to continue violating established guidelines/

circulars, with impunity.

Institutional Negligence and the Urgent Need for Reform

43. Ragging often targets students based on socioeconomic background,

ethnicity, gender, or regional identity, perpetuating existing prejudices

within the student community. Senior students use ragging as a tool to

assert dominance, fostering a culture of subservience rather than equality.

In addition, ragging also takes on sexist and misogynistic forms, where

female students are subjected to additional forms of humiliation,

objectification, or even sexual harassment, which can be identified as a

manifestation of gender-based prejudice.

44. Enforcement mechanisms have manifestly failed with or without the

implicit support of the authorities that matter, permitting ragging to

persist as a deeply ingrained practice within university culture. Despite

the various countermeasures in place, enforcement remains elusive or, at

its best, abrupt and inconsistent. Many cases stand unreported due to

institutional negligence or the victims' fear of retaliation, a cause for

prejudice, or retribution.

30

45. The free education system in Sri Lanka aims to provide equal academic

opportunities to all students from the poorest to the wealthiest; however,

ragging disproportionately affects all strata of society. Student dropouts

due to fear and psychological trauma act as a barrier to pursuing their right

to free education. Sri Lanka invests heavily in higher education, but due

to widespread ragging incidents, public-funded universities have become

sites for violence rather than institutions for academic progression.

Ragging corrupts the core intent of free education, restricting academic

access and nurturing abuse under the guise of institutional norms.

46. Thus, ragging is not merely bullying, but also an institutionalized

manifestation of prejudice, preventing students from equal opportunities,

fostering discrimination, and enabling systemic injustices. This Court is of

the view that strengthening oversight and ensuring strict implementation

of laws is crucial in eradicating ragging from Sri Lankan universities.

47. As discussed earlier in this Judgment, most universities have established

internal mechanisms to prevent ragging, including disciplinary codes and

student conduct guidelines. However, it is lamentable that these measures

are often poorly enforced or not enforced at all, leaving the victim more

vulnerable and unsafe, due to administrative failures to take appropriate

and proactive steps to monitor and prevent ragging. In many cases,

complaints are either ignored or inadequately addressed, leaving victims

without proper recourse. The lack of stringent enforcement mechanisms

has contributed to a culture of impunity, where perpetrators continue with

their abusive practices unabated.

48. The Court observed that a significant number of ragging cases go

unreported due to fear of reprisal, social stigma, and lack of trust in

institutional authorities. Victims often refrain from filing complaints due

to concerns that their academic progression or personal safety may be

jeopardized. Additionally, some students perceive ragging as an

31

unavoidable rite of passage, further discouraging them from seeking

justice. The underreporting, which has led to a distorted perception of the

prevalence of ragging, allowing university administrators to downplay its

severity, is deplorable.

49. The Court also observed that one of the reasons ragging in universities

continued for years on end is that university staff members remained silent

about ragging incidents. Some administrative or faculty members advocate

silence and complaisance, either due to personal affiliations or external

influence, and fail to take action against perpetrators. This complicity

enables ragging to continue unchecked, reinforcing a cycle of abuse within

the university environment. The absence of independent oversight

mechanisms exacerbates this issue, making it difficult to hold institutions

accountable for their failure to protect students. This is clearly supported

by the Vice Chancellor of the University of Ruhuna, in paragraph 54 of his

affidavit dated 21/02/2024, which reads as follows;

I further state that it was not possible for the ragging in that form to

have existed for a long period of time without the knowledge of the

academic staff, non-academic staff, security staff including Rakna

Lanka staff, cleaning staff, canteen keeper and his staff, sub wardens,

wardens. They were part of the whole process. There was simple

ignorance of responsibility of civil society in the prevention of crimes.

50. This Court recognizes that the persistence of ragging in Sri Lankan

universities underscores the urgent need for systemic reform. Universities

must not only declare but also enforce a zero-tolerance policy towards

ragging, ensuring that complaints are promptly investigated, appropriate

disciplinary action is taken swiftly, and accountability measures are

enforced for lapses in implementation. Strengthening legal frameworks,

improving awareness campaigns, and fostering a culture of respect and

32

inclusion are essential steps toward eradicating ragging and ensuring a safe

educational environment for all students.

51. The Court is of the view that the inability to prevent or to hold perpetrators

accountable must result in consequences for individuals responsible.

University administrative members should be held responsible for failing

to report ragging incidents. If systemic negligence is proven, penalties such

as suspension or dismissal must be enforced. Additionally, accountability

should extend to faculty members who are entrusted with ensuring a safe

and disciplined educational environment, and mandatory anti-ragging

training to recognize signs of ragging, intervene effectively, and resist

bribery or external pressure to ignore complaints.

Creating a Safe Environment for Victims of Ragging to Lodge Complaints.

52. Strengthening implementation mechanisms alone will be insufficient to

curb and curtail ragging if affected students refrain from lodging

complaints due to fear of retaliation or institutional apathy. The effective

eradication of ragging necessitates not only robust enforcement but also

the creation of a legal and administrative environment wherein students

are assured protection, free from intimidation ensuring their willingness to

report such offences. Higher Education Institutions must unequivocally

reinforce that ragging constitutes a criminal act with no place within

academic settings, necessitating strict procedural safeguards that both

deter perpetrators and empower students to seek justice without fear.

53. Upon filing a complaint regarding ragging, the complainant's safety must

be ensured through protective measures akin to witness protection

protocols. Universities must implement strict confidentiality policies to

prevent disclosure of the complainant's identity and provide necessary

safeguards to protect them from retaliation by senior students or other

interested parties. This includes secure accommodation, monitored access

33

to facilities, and direct coordination with law enforcement where

necessary, ensuring that the students can continue their education without

fear of intimidation or further harm.

54. The academic and non-academic staff, should intervene positively to report

ragging incidents. Consciously permitting such incidents to persist must

bear accountability for negligence in performing their duties, and

disciplinary measures should follow. Additionally, accountability should

extend to student union leaders to ensure they actively prevent and/or

discourage ragging instead of nurturing a culture of silence and impunity.

55. Therefore, this Court insists that a safe environment should be created for

the protection of university students to approach first responders at the

earliest to seek redress and to be afforded such relief promptly and in a

purposeful manner without being subjected to fear or favor. Creating that

environment would rest squarely on the authorities.

Conclusions

56. This Court is of the view that the Guidelines to Combat Ragging in Higher

Educational Institutions, marked "Z3", drafted with the agreement of all

Added Respondents and relevant stakeholders, would curtail incidents of

ragging and further act as a deterrent in its application. Accordingly, the

said Guidelines to Combat Ragging in Higher Educational

Institutions, identified as Orders of Court, referred to in Annexure I,

shall form part of this Judgement. All Orders of Court, in Annexure I, shall

be duly implemented by all Respondents. The Respondents shall report

back to this Court the steps taken to comply with the directions of the

Court, inter alia, making of By-laws, designing a foundation course, issuing

ministerial orders, issuing police circulars, requesting budgetary

allocations, within 6 months from the date of this Judgment. This Court

34

insists on strict compliance and enforcement of the said orders by all

relevant stakeholders.

57. In due consideration of the submissions made by the learned President's

Counsel for the Petitioners, this Court would not proceed to make a

declaration on the violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution by any of

the Respondents as prayed for, and the subsequent grant of Leave in terms

of Article 12(1).

58. In conclusion, we wish to place on record our deep appreciation of the

assistance given by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, Dr. Avanti Perera,

the learned President's Counsel who represented the Petitioners and all

other learned Counsel who appeared for the added Respondents and made

submissions in this matter.

be promptly informed to the Proctor, who shall forthwith inform

the Vice Chancellor for steps to inquire into such incident and take

necessary action;

i) Where the police fail to commence investigations of a complaint of

ragging within 30 days of the complaint or unduly influences a

victim or his family members to have the complaint withdrawn, the

Committee shall notify the Vice Chancellor who shall make a

complaint against the relevant police officers to the Inspector

General of Police, with a copy to the Attorney General;

37

j) Identify and seek the assistance of a panel of attorneys-at-law, who

have sufficient experience and preferably having a practice within

the province in which the HEI is located, who are willing to provide

pro bono legal representation for victims7 and facilitating access to

justice for victims;

k) Require that a member of the Committee, as well as an attorney-

at-law from the aforesaid panel, accompanies a victim to the police

station to report the alleged incident of ragging, where the victim

has not already lodged a complaint by himself;

l) Facilitate victims to obtain medical treatment, including

absence and extension of academic deadlines, in terms of the

applicable rules and regulations,8 with a view to minimizing drop-

outs due to the trauma of ragging;

o) Facilitate all victims, until the completion of their degree, to access

continuous counselling services within the HEI, if available, or as

provided by professionals or relevant authorities outside the HEI;

p) Ensure that, in the course of exercising the functions of the

Committee, every member thereof shall respect the privacy of the

victim and maintain confidentiality;

7 Alternatively, the UGC may provide for a central panel of attorneys-at-law from among whom each HEI may seek, pro bono legal assistance in respect of incidents of ragging, as and when necessary, on a case by case basis. The HEI or the UGC, as the case may be, may seek the assistance of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka in order to constitute the panel of attorneys-at-law, 8 If existing rules and regulations are inadequate to implement this guideline, the HEI should take steps to amend the same or make new rules or regulations.

38

q) Make recommendations to the Anti-Ragging Committee and/or

the Gender Focal Point of the HEI, on measures to prevent ragging.

2. Every HEI shall have an effective internal disciplinary inquiry

mechanism, which includes the following features:

attend academic activities at the university premises, the

perpetrator and, where necessary, any of his associates, should be

imposed with no-contact orders restricting them from coming

within close distance of or communicating with the victim or any

witness. Subject to available resources, reasonable measures

should also be taken to ensure that both parties do not share the

same hostel/accommodation facilities during the pendency of the

inquiry.

3. Every HEI shall facilitate any student against whom disciplinary

proceedings in respect of an alleged incident of ragging are pending or

have been concluded without an order for expelling such student, to

access counselling services within the HEI, if available, or as provided

by professionals or relevant authorities outside the HEI.

39
