"5.","Following  the  incident,  the  2nd  Petitioner  was  immediately  rushed  to"
"","Colombo South Teaching Hospital and, due to the gravity of his injuries, he"
"","was later transferred to the National Hospital, Colombo. He remained in"
"","intensive  care  for  over  three  months,  undergoing  multiple  surgeries  to"
"","address  haemorrhage  and  fractures.  His  recovery has  required  extensive"
"","physiotherapy, 
including 
chest 
therapy, 
limb 
rehabilitation, 
speech"
"","therapy,  and  occupational  therapy.  Despite  these  medical  interventions,"
"","the extent of his long-term recovery  remains uncertain,  raising  concerns"
"","about his ability to resume a normal life."

.","Through the Petition, the Petitioners seek judicial intervention to ensure"
"","accountability and justice. They emphasize that this case not only concerns"
"","the  personal  grievances  of 
the  2nd  Petitioner,  but  also  has  broader"
"","implications 
for 
university 
students 
at 
large.  The 
Petition 
urges"
"","institutional reforms and heightened oversight to prevent future instances"
"","of ragging that could disrupt the lives of young students seeking to pursue"
"","higher education."

.","The Petitioners assert that the University Administration, despite granting"
"","permission 
for 
the 
social 
event  on  05/03/2020, 
failed 
to 
ensure"
"","compliance  with 
the 
stipulated 
conditions.  The  administration  had"
"","mandated that the event conclude by 10:00 p.m. and explicitly prohibited"
"","the  prevalence  of  alcohol  within  university  premises.  However,  these"
"","restrictions were not adequately enforced. The lack of oversight resulted in"
"","alcohol  being  brought  onto  campus  premises, 
leading  to 
intoxication"
"","among some of the students, including individuals involved in the incident"
"","that caused severe injuries sustained to the 2nd Petitioner. Moreover, the"
"","event continued past midnight, far beyond the permitted time, highlighting"
"","a lapse in supervisory measures."
