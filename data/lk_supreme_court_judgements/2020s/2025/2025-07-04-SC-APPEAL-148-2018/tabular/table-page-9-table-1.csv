"Appellants’ Motion to Add the New Owner as a Necessary Party to the Appeal"
"22.  However, on 11th October 2017, the Appellants had brought to the notice of this Court by"
"way of a  motion, that the ownership of the movable property in dispute had changed,"
"seeking  permission  to  add  the new  owner,  one  Selvarasa  Selvarooban,  as  a  ‘necessary"
"party’  to the instant appeal, as such addition is necessary to ‘effectually  and completely"
"adjudicate  the  dispute’.  Owing  to  the  said  motion  being  misplaced,  Appellant  had"
"repeated this application in a second motion dated 03rd May 2018, as well as two other"
"motions, dated 10th October 2018 and 26th November 2018. Along with the fourth motion,"
"the Appellant had tendered an amended petition and affidavit, with an amended caption"
