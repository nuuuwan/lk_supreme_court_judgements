"26.  Thereafter, this matter was initially taken up for argument on 03rd February 2025, it was",""
"","revealed that the Counsel for the Appellant had not filed written submissions as required"
"","under the Supreme Court Rules. In addition,  it was further revealed that she is not duly"
"","prepared  to  make  submissions  and  had not numbered  the  brief  properly,  rendering  it"
"","virtually impossible for this Court to follow the submissions of either party."
"27.","In the interest of justice, this Court rescheduled the matter and ordered the Appellants to"
"","file  written  submissions  and  properly  number  the  Appeal  Brief.  When  the  argument"
"","resumed on 17th March 2025, the Court found that the Counsel for the Appellant had not"
"","complied with the order and that she had filed written submissions well after the deadline"
"","without seeking permission from the Court. The argument was once again postponed to"
"","the next day, as the Registered Attorney  (who was  also  the Counsel in the matter)  had"
"","failed to properly number the Appeal Brief as well."
"28.","In spite of all such irregularities in the course of this Appeal, in the interest of justice and"
"","in order to be fair by the  litigants,  this Court allowed the  proceedings  to continue and"
"","granted all parties permission to file post-argument written submissions."
"","“Preliminary Objection” of the Appellants"
"29.  Adding on to the irregularities, the Counsel for Appellants sought to raise a preliminary",""
"","objection  when  the  matter  was  taken  up  for  argument,  as  well  as 
in  their  written"
"","submissions, which were not filed according to Supreme Court Rules but were only filed"
"","after this Court directed the Appellant to file the same once this matter was taken up for"
"","argument."
"30.","In this “preliminary objection”, she  contends that the  Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent"
"","did not exercise his right of appeal in time but instead sought to challenge the decision"
