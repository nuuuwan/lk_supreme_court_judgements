"with the Plaintiff leaving out the 1st Defendant while there was an undertaking, as per the said"
"agreements, to indemnify and hold harmless the 1st Defendant from any liabilities that may arise"
"– vide Order dated 08.07.2009. The said Order specifically states that the said amendment is vital"
"as the said amendment would decide whether the 1st Defendant is liable to pay damages to the"
"Plaintiff as prayed for in the Plaint. By the amended answer, among other things, after revealing"
"the existence of the said three agreements, the 1st Defendant had averred that if there is any money"
"to be recovered by the Plaintiff, it should be recovered from the 2nd Defendant and not from the 1st"
"Defendant, and at the end had prayed to dismiss the Plaintiff’s action. If the learned High Court"
"Judge misconceived the facts and law and thought that the Plaintiff should have enforced the said"
"three agreements without proceedings against the 1st Defendant, the result would have been the"
"dismissal of the action against the 1st Defendant. Anyhow, the Judgment was not to dismiss the"
"action against the 1st Defendant. In fact, it is against the 1st Defendant and the prayer for injunction"

"Agreements marked 1D4, 1D5, and 1D6 entered into between the 1st and 2nd Defendants, whereby"
"the 2nd Defendant singlehandedly accepted all the liabilities arising out of those Agreements. At"
"one place, the learned High Court judge considers the possible unenforceability of the aforesaid"
"three agreements and in another place, Court’s inability to order further compensation to be paid"
"by the 2nd Defendant due to the settlement. Thus, it is indicated that the learned High Court Judge"
"considered evidence before the Court, especially the three agreements and decided that it is not"
