"proceedings, the liability to monetary claims, namely damages and or compensation etc. should"
"have been imposed on the 2nd Defendant using the Court’s discretion. In my view, this could have"
"been done if the 2nd Defendant remained a party to the action in terms of the aforequoted Section"
"14 of the Civil Procedure Code even if the Plaint had been filed alleging joint liability as explained"
"above  since  the  said  section  contemplates  a  judgment  to  be  given  according  to  the  respective"
"liabilities of the Defendants. Merely because the Plaintiff entered into a settlement with one of the"
"Defendants,  taking  away  the  Courts  ability  to  use  discretion  on  the  respective  liabilities  as"
"contemplated by aforesaid Section 14 on the said Defendant who entered into a settlement, the"
"Court should not impose the said liability that could have been imposed on the one who entered"
"into settlement with the Plaintiff on the remaining Defendant or Defendants. The discretion that"
"the Court has in terms of Section 14 of the Civil procedure Code to decide respective liabilities"
"should not be affected owing to any settlement entered between the Plaintiff and one or some of"
"the Defendants."
"On the other hand, if there is a doubt as to why a Court acted in a certain manner, if it can be"
"referrable to a provision of law or a legal basis, in my view it has to be presumed that it was so"
"happened  due  to  that  legal  basis. What  the  Plaintiff  has  done  was,  before  the  Court  decide  the"
"respective liabilities of the Defendants, to enter into a settlement with 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiff"
"must  face  the  consequences  of  such  a  settlement  as  Section  408  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code"
"provides for adjustment of actions wholly or in part and once the decree is passed it becomes final"
"between the parties. Referring to Mack v. Perera 33 NLR 179 at 180-181 it is pointed out when"
"money is paid, it is to be applied according to the expressed will of the payer, not of the receiver."
"As  such,  it  is  argued  that  there  is  nothing  in  the  settlement  between  the  Plaintiff  and  the  2nd"
"Defendant to show that the payment made by the 2nd Defendant was also intended to release the"
"1st Defendant from his liability regarding the infringements. Factually this may be correct but it is"
"also  clear  that  the  2nd  Defendant’s  payment  was  made  to  relieve  the  2nd  Defendant  from  his"
"liabilities of the alleged infringements. Thus, what was settled there was the liability that may come"
"upon  the  2nd  Defendant,  if  the  case  is  continued  against  him.  In  other  words,  if  the  case  was"
"continued against him, what may be decided as his respective liability in terms of Section 14 of"
"the Civil Procedure Code by the Judge has been settled for an agreed value by the parties to the"
"settlement. Decision of the respective liability falls within the judgment of the Judge on evidence"
"available  to  him.  As  explained  above,  it  appears  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  decided"
