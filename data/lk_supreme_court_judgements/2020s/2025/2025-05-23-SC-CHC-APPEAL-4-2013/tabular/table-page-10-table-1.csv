"respective liability with regard to prayer ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’, and ‘f’ should not fall on the 1st Defendant as"
"per the evidence available but should fall on the 2nd Defendant. Thus, this Court does not see that"
"the decision to not grant prayer ‘c’ which contemplates the compensation or damages against the"
"1st Defendant was not based on a misconception or the forgetfulness of the principles relating to"
"privity  of  contracts  as  urged  by  the  Counsel  for  the  Plaintiff  but  a  decision  taken  on  available"
"evidence in deciding respective liabilities in terms of Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Code which"
"is within the power of the High Court and also the task of the High Court in judgment. //"
"On the other hand, the learned High Court Judge could have observed that it is unreasonable to"
"impose the liability for damages or compensation on the 1st Defendant as per evidence revealed by"
"the said agreements, it was the 2nd Defendant who misrepresented and deceived the 1st Defendant"
"as to the ownership of the intellectual property rights in issue and got the 1st Defendant to take part"
"in the infringements and the 1st Defendant was merely instrumental in the infringing act due to"
"said misrepresentation, and as such the liabilities with regard to damages and compensation should"
"fall on the 2nd Defendant. I do not think it was an unreasonable view on the part of the learned"
"High Court Judge. That seems to be the reason, the learned High Court Judge had stated that due"
"to the unique facts and circumstances of this case especially in view of the said agreements he was"
"not inclined to grant relief relating to compensation and damages. It must also be mentioned here"
"that, as per Section 22 (2) (b) of the Intellectual Property Act, where the infringer did not know or"
"had no reasonable cause to know that he was engaged in infringing activity, the court may limit"
"damages  to  the  profits  or  to  pre-established  damages.  It  is  also  noted  what  has  been  prayed  as"
"damages is Rs. 20 million which has to be proved as against the statutory damage of which the"
"maximum limit is Rs. 10 million."
"It  is  also  contended  on  behalf  of  the  Plaintiff  that,  under  and  in  terms  of  the  said Agreements"
"marked as '1D4', 'ID5' and '1D6', any obligation on the part of the 2nd Defendant to indemnify"
"arises  only  in  favour  of  the  1st  Defendant  and  conditional  upon  any  loss,  liability,  damage  or"
"judgment occurring to or being granted against the 1st Defendant. Hence, it is further contended"
"that due to the determination of the learned High Court Judge not to grant relief by way of damages"
"and/or compensation to the Plaintiff against the 1st Defendant, no liability has arisen on the part of"
"the  1st  Defendant,  in  the  first  instance,  in  respect  of  the  said  acts  of  infringement  of  copyright"
"belonging  to  the  estate  of  late  Clarance  Wijewardene  committed  by  the  1st  Defendant,  and"
