"marked in evidence, the Court cannot consider them as evidential materials in coming to a decision"
"to do justice. Aforesaid three agreements were tendered along with affidavit evidence of the 1st"
"Defendant tendered as evidence-in-chief of his evidence and the only objection was based on that"
"they were photocopies thus subject to tendering the originals-vide proceedings dated 15.11.2011."
"Originals were shown on 11.05.2012- vide proceedings dated 11.05.2012."
"Even though the Counsel for the Plaintiffs state that 1st Defendant was found liable for the flagrant"
"violation of the intellectual property rights of the estate of late Clarance Wijewardene, the said"
"three agreements marked in evidence indicate that it was the 2nd Defendant who misrepresented"
"and deceived the 1st Respondent to cause the infringements. However, the Plaintiff entered into a"
"settlement with the 2nd Defendant for a lesser amount than she has claimed as damages in the Plaint"
"but proceeded against the 1st Defendant to claim the whole amount."
"As per Section 22 of the Intellectual Property Act of 2003, the High Court hearing the case has"
"power to grant damages for infringements including the infringements of moral rights. Section 21"
"of  the  1979 Act  similarly  recognized  this  power  of  Court  to  grant  damages  for  infringements"
"including infringements of moral rights – Vide Director, Department of Fisheries and Aquatic"
"Resources  and  Three  Others  v.  C. Aloy.  W.  Fernando  and  Five  Others.  [Cabral's  IP  Law"
"Reports (Volume II) 1010 at 1037]."
"Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Code which is quoted below is s also important in this regard."
"“All persons may be joined as defendants against whom the right to any relief is alleged to exist,"
"whether  jointly,  severally,  or  in  the  alternative,  in  respect  of  the  same  cause  of  action.  And"
"judgment may be given against such one or more of the Defendants as may be found to be liable,"
"according to their respective liabilities, without any amendment.” (emphasis by me)"
"Aforementioned Section, as Counsel of the Plaintiff also submits, empowers the Court to grant"
"judgment  against  individual  Defendants  based  on  their  respective  liabilities,  irrespective  of"
"whether the action had been instituted against defendants for them to be liable jointly, severally or"
"in the alternative. Thus, even though, the Plaint in the case at hand has alleged joint liability of the"
"Defendants, the Court has the discretion to give judgment according to their respective liabilities."
"It is true that the decision of the learned High Court Judge not to grant relief by way of damages"
"and/or compensation to the Plaintiff has referred to the three (3) Agreements mentioned above,"
