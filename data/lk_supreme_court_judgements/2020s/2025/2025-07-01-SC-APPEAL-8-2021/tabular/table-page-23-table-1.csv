"64.","I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment proposed to be delivered by my"
"","learned  brother  Thurairaja,  PC,  J.  I  agree  with  his  conclusion  that  the  appeal  must  be"
"","allowed and the order of the Commercial High Court dated 25th February 2019 set aside."
"65.","I wish to set forth succinctly my reasons for allowing the appeal."
"66.  The  Commercial  High  Court  by  its  judgment  dated  8th  December  2018  granted  the",""
"","application  made  by  the  Petitioner-Respondent-Appellant  (Appellant)  to  enforce  the"
"","arbitral 
award. 
Sometime 
thereafter, 
the 
1st 
Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent"
"","(Respondent) made an application to the Commercial High Court under Section 839 of"
"","the Civil Procedure Code to have the judgment dated 8th December 2018 set aside on"
"","per incuriam basis."
"67.","It was the contention of the Respondent that though the model number and the serial"
"","number as depicted in the lease agreement was in fact the vehicle claimed to have been"
"","given on lease, in actual fact it was a different vehicle given to the Respondent bearing a"
"","different  model  number  and  serial  number.  It  was  claimed  that  the  Appellant  had"
"","engaged in similar type of deceptive transactions with several other customers of the"
"","Appellant.  The  Respondent  asserted  that  the  fact  the  Appellant  had  given  a  different"
"","vehicle on lease, other than the vehicle bearing the model number and the serial number"
"","as stated in the lease agreement to the Respondent is evident from the fact that, in the"
"","document marked X1, a different model tractor has been mentioned as belonging to the"
"","Appellant. The Respondent therefore contended that arbitration proceedings could not"
"","have commenced."
"68.","It  appears  that  the  learned  judge  of  the  Commercial  High  Court  had  granted  the"
"","Appellant several dates in order to clarify the position but it was not done. The impugned"
"","order was made thereafter."
