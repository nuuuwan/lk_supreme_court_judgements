"43.  Accordingly, in light of the above discussion, I answer the third question of law in the",""
"","Affirmative, for the Respondents have not duly made an application under Section 32 of"
"","the Arbitration Act to challenge the arbitral award."
"44.","In light of this finding, I am of the view that there is no necessity to consider the fourth"
"","question of law."
"45.  Considering the first and second questions of law together, the 1st Respondent claims",""
"","that the Appellant had leased to him a vehicle different from the one identified in the"
"","lease  agreement,  asserting 
that  although 
the 
lease  states 
the  model  number  as"
"","‘K600A22888,’ the document marked ‘X1’ being the notice of writ issued to the Fiscal of"
"","the High Court of Kandy, refers to the model as ‘K75’. Based on this discrepancy, the 1st"
"","Respondent alleges that the Appellant engaged in a fraudulent transaction."
"46.  This  Court  finds  that  the  arbitral  award  was  issued  in  relation  to  the  lease  agreement",""
"","bearing No. HOLELE1301234800, which specifically identifies the vehicle with the model"
"","number  ‘K600A22888’  and  the  serial  number  ‘GA75-009790’.  These  same  details  are"
"","reflected in the vehicle registration document and the delivery order, both of which have"
"","been included in the brief as part of the Appellant’s supporting material and are relied"
"","upon to substantiate the Appellant’s position."
"47.","In response to the seizure order subsequently issued during writ execution contains a"
"","reference to the model number ‘K75’, the Appellant submits that this may have been the"
"","result of an inadvertent clerical error in the enforcement process."
"48.  This Court wishes to make clear that it is not within its scope to determine whether the",""
"","vehicle  delivered  was  different  from  the  one  referred  to  in  the  lease  agreement.  The"
"","allegation of factual inconsistency based on a model number discrepancy would require"
"","a re-evaluation of evidence already presented to and assessed by the arbitral tribunal."
