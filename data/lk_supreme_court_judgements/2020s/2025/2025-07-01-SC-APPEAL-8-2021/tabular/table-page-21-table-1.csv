"","S. Thurairaja, PC, J."
"","also undermines party autonomy and the finality of arbitral awards, effectively defeating"
"","the  purpose  of  alternative  dispute  resolution.  Judicial  restraint  in  this  context  is  not  a"
"","matter of discretion but a legal imperative flowing from legislative intent."
"57.","I would be remiss if I did not address the legal foundation upon which the 1st Respondent"
"","sought to challenge the judgment of the Commercial High Court dated 08th December"
"","2017.  The  application  was  filed  under  Section  839  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code,  which"
"","preserves the inherent power of the court to make such orders as may be necessary for"
"","the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court. It does not provide a"
"","basis  for  reopening  matters  that  have  already  been  conclusively  determined  by  an"
"","arbitral tribunal acting under the authority of the Arbitration Act."
"58.","In  the  present  case,  the  1st  Respondent  sought  to  invoke  Section  839  of  the  Civil"
"","Procedure Code on the ground that the judgment enforcing the arbitral award had been"
"","entered per incuriam. However, a careful examination of the pleadings and of the High"
"","Court’s order dated 25th February 2019 makes it clear that the contention advanced by"
"","the 1st Respondent centred not on any procedural oversight committed by the Court, but"
"","rather on factual assertions relating to the vehicle delivered under the lease agreement,"
"","assertions which had not been raised before the arbitral tribunal, and which were not"
"","addressed in the award. The effect of the application was thus to invite the Court to re-"
"","evaluate  matters  that  were,  by  that  stage,  beyond  the  Court’s  jurisdiction.  The  per"
"","incuriam rule has no application in this context."
"59.","In my view, the learned High Court Judge, in granting the said application, exceeded the"
"","scope of their jurisdiction under Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code. The jurisdiction"
"","conferred by  said provision does not permit  a court to displace the legal  effect of an"
"","arbitral award by re-examining facts that were, or could have been, raised in arbitration."
"","To do so amounts to sitting in appeal over an arbitral award."
