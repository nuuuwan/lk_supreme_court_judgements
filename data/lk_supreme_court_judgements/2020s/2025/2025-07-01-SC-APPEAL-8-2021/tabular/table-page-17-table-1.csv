"40.","In the present case, the Respondents have made no attempt to assert that the arbitral"
"","award  was  not  served  on  them  earlier;  nor  have  any  such  claim  been  raised  in  their"
"","petition before the Commercial High Court."
"41.  Any party seeking to challenge the award must bring all grounds of challenge within that",""
"","time frame and place before the High Court all the supporting material, including that"
"","which is intended to invoke the Court’s intervention under Section 32(1)(b). This ensures"
"","finality  in  arbitral  proceedings  and  discourages  parties  from  attempting  to  reopen"
"","matters long after the award has been made and served. It further provides certainty to"
"","parties who have acted on the outcome of the award, preventing unnecessary disruption"
"","to commercial arrangements."
"42.","It must be underscored that arbitration, as a mode of dispute resolution, exists not merely"
"","as  an  alternative 
to 
litigation  but  as  a 
framework  designed 
to  promote 
finality,"
"","expediency, and party autonomy in the resolution of commercial disputes. The statutory"
"","time limits imposed for challenging an award are not procedural technicalities, but an"
"","essential feature of that framework, intended to provide closure and certainty to parties"
"","who have chosen to resolve their disputes privately and efficiently through arbitration."
"","To  permit  belated  or  procedurally 
irregular  challenges  would  not  only  erode  the"
"","effectiveness  of  the  arbitral  process  but  also  undermine  the  legislative  intent,  which"
"","places a premium on respecting the integrity and conclusiveness of arbitral awards. In"
"","this instance, it is evident that the Respondents have not acted within the boundaries set"
"","by law, nor have they demonstrated cause for judicial intervention at this stage."
