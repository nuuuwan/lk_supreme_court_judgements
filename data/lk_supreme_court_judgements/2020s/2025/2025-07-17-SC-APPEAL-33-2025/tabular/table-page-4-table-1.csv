"I have noted above that once the copy-pasted portions of the post-hearing written submissions"
"of learned Counsel before the Court of Appeal are removed from the impugned judgment, there"
"is  no  independent  evaluation  of  the  positions  taken  up  by  the  two  parties.  Nor  are  there"
"independent judicial findings."
"I
n  these  circumstances,  the  2nd  question  in  respect  of  which  Special  Leave  to  Appeal  has  been"
"granted  must  necessarily  be  answered  in  the  negative,  i.e.,  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  has  not"
"consciously, judiciously and independently considered the cases presented to it by the parties."
"W
hat is then left for this Court to decide is whether this Court should direct the Court of Appeal"
"to rehear this matter."
"W
e have considered the nature of the dispute presented to the Court of Appeal by the two sides,"
"in  respect  of  which  a  highly  relevant  fact  is  the  age  of  the  Petitioners  and  those  whom  they"
"represent.  This 
is  particularly  given  the  passage  of  time  since  the  filing  of  the  original"
"Application in the Court of Appeal and the relevancy of their age to the question of retirement"
"from public service. As learned counsel for the Appellant pointed out, it is more than likely that"
"these Petitioners have by now exceeded the age of 63 which thereby disentitles them to remain"
"in  public  service  even  under  the  terms  of  the  gazette  notification,  which  the  Executive  had"
"initially introduced (which extended the age of retirement from 60 to 63) and later vacated. It is"
"the vacation of the said notification which led to the Petitioners â€“ Respondents instituting action"
"in the Court of Appeal. In the circumstances, the third question of law in respect of which Special"
"Leave to Appeal was granted must also be answered in favour of the Appellants."
"L
earned counsel for the Respondents submits that this is an instance where the Executive has"
"treated medical officers and medical specialists differently from the manner in which they have"
"treated nursing officers."
"I
n  view  of  the  fact  that  this  Court  is  exercising  appellate 
jurisdiction  with  regard  to  the"
"impugned Judgment of the Court of Appeal, it is the view of this Court that this is not a fit case"
"where this Court should consider and decide whether in fact one party has been discriminated"
"against the other. In the circumstances, we refrain from making any observation in that regard."
"However, if the Respondents so choose, they may engage in suitable negotiations and arrive at"
"an amicable settlement on whether any nursing officer aged between 60 to 63 who has served"
"the National Health Service beyond reaching 60 years ought to be remunerated."
