Decided on: 18/02/2025

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

[1] The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent, (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Applicant-Respondent) preferred an application dated 21/09/2012 to the Labour

Tribunal Galle, stating inter alia, that his employment as a heavy-duty driver with

the Respondent-Appellant-Appellants, (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Respondent-Appellant) was unjustly terminated with effect from 03/09/2012. The

Applicant sought reinstatement with back wages, payment of his statutory

entitlements and compensation arising from unjust termination of services.

[2] By answer dated 23/10/2012, the Appellant denied termination of service of the

Respondent. It further said that the Applicant, no longer having any intention to

carry out his services as an employee, used vituperative language on one of the

directors and left the place of employment on his own volition.

P a g e 4 | 14

[3] At the conclusion of the Inquiry, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal by

Order dated 09/09/2016, held with the Applicant and directed that the Respondent

should pay 3 years back wages for the financial loss caused to the Applicant.

[4] Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent by Petition of Appeal dated

11/10/2016, appealed to the High Court of the Southern Province holden in Galle

(the High Court). The High Court, by Judgment dated 03/03/2021 affirmed the

said Order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal dated 09/09/2016 and

dismissed the appeal with costs.

[5] The Respondent-Appellant, by Petition dated 02/10/2020 is before this Court, to

set aside the said Judgment dated 03/03/2021, delivered by the High Court.

[6] By Order dated 04/08/2022, this Court granted leave to appeal on the following

questions of law;

I. Has the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the

Southern Province holden at Galle failed to appreciate and consider the fact

that the Learned President of Labour Tribunal has admitted and accepted

and acted upon the false testimony of the aforesaid Ayurvedic Physician

Walawage in the light of the fact that the said witness himself has admitted

that he falsified his record for the purpose of issuing the medical certificate

marked A1

II. While the answer of the Respondents reveal; that the Applicant scolded and

used vituperative language on one of the directors of the employer company

and further cross examining the Applicant on the above basis the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal held that the said position of the

Respondent was a new position created by the Respondents subsequent to

the Applicant closed his case being an error of law has not been appreciated

P a g e 5 | 14

by the learned High Court Judge

III. Did the Learned High Court Judge fail to appreciate that the order of the

Labour Tribunal was not just and equitable.

[7] The Applicants evidence before the Labour Tribunal was limited to that of the

Applicant and of an Ayurvedic Physician who examined the mother of the

Applicant for a shoulder ailment on 03/09/2021.

[8] The position of the Applicant is that on the day in question, i.e. 03/09/2012, the

Respondent had requested that he undertakes a long-distance delivery of goods.

Since his mother was indisposed due to a fracture in her shoulder, he was

compelled to keep away from his duties in order to attend to his mothers medical

needs. However, the Respondent had insisted that he carried on with the assigned

task, or no longer have his employment with the Respondent-Appellant.

[9] The Applicant claimed that, subsequent to this incident, successive attempts to

report for duty was thwarted by the Respondent and he was finally informed that

his services were no longer required.

[10] In order to establish his mothers indisposition, the Applicant submitted a medical

certificate issued by an Ayurvedic Physician marked X4 which certified that the

Applicants mother was treated for a left shoulder fracture from 1 st September

2012 to 3 months time (produced verbatim), and the register of patients for the

relevant period marked X7.

[11] The Applicant claimed that the prescribed period by the Ayurvedic Physician was

a course of treatment to be taken every other day commencing from 1 st September

2012.

[12] It is the position of the Appellant that the entry of the Applicants mothers name

on 01/09/2012, is a falsification of the register of patients. The Appellant points

P a g e 6 | 14

out that the penultimate entry in the page of the register of patients was made on

27/08/2012 whilst the very first entry on the next page of the register is 30/08/2012.

Therein it is submitted that, in order to justify the claim of the Applicant, the

Applicants mothers name was entered making use of the blank space below the

last line. This position had been admitted by the Ayurvedic Physician in his

evidence before the Tribunal.

[13] In his testimony, the Ayurvedic Physician clearly states that he did not recall the

exact date on which the Applicants mother was seen by him and that upon the

Applicants request, an entry was inserted to the medical registry and a medical

certificate was issued.

[14] The reason for the Applicants refusal to engage in the long-distance work

assignment was that his mother had to be taken to the Ayurvedic Physician every

other day of the week and accordingly, the Applicant was with his mother for

treatment on 03/09/2012. It is observed that the Applicant has admitted in evidence

that in the ensuing month, his mother had not visited the Ayurvedic Physician on

any other day other than the 03/09/2012.

[15] It is submitted that the Labour Tribunal has failed to consider the said admission

of falsification of the medical registry in its proper perspective which has created

a substantial doubt as to whether the Applicant consulted the Ayurvedic Physician

on 03/09/2012, therein, to strengthen his position in rejecting to engage in his work

assignment and thereby to justify unjust termination of employment.

[16] In his testimony before the Tribunal, the Ayurvedic Physician has clearly admitted

that he incorporated a false entry to the register of patients in order to tender it as

evidence in this case:

P a g e 7 | 14

:

.

. .

.

[17] In the above circumstances, the learned Counsel for the Appellant urged Court to

disregard the evidence of the Ayurvedic Physician which creates a substantial

doubt to his credibility and his testimonial trustworthiness.

[18] When evaluating evidence on falsification of the medical register, the Labour

Tribunal concludes that trustworthiness of the evidence should not be challenged

on the scheme of registration of patients but on the evaluation of evidence given

by the Ayurvedic Physician in its totality. However, neither the Tribunal nor the

High Court made any adverse finding on a clear admission in evidence by the

Ayurvedic Physician of falsifying the medical register.

[19] It is also observed that the Labour Tribunal and the High Court failed to examine

the said evidence relating to the falsification of the medical register which weighed

strongly on the presumption that it could have been carried out for the Applicant

to construct a case to justify unjust termination of employment.

[20] In the circumstances, I find reason to address the first and third questions of law,

together.

Section 31C(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act provides that Where an application

under section 31B is made to a Labour Tribunal, it shall be the duty of the tribunal

to make all such inquiries into that application and hear all such evidence as the

tribunal may consider necessary, and thereafter make not later than six months

from the date of such application, such order as may appear to the tribunal to be

just and equitable (emphasis added).

P a g e 8 | 14

[21] Equity, carries a fundamental maxim: "He who seeks equity must come with clean

hands." This principle was established in the landmark case of Dering vs. Earl of

Winchelsea1 and has since been consistently upheld as an integral principle of

equitable relief. Therefore, a party seeking the intervention of a Tribunal or Court

on equitable grounds must demonstrate honesty and integrity in their conduct.

[22] The said deliberate misrepresentation made by the Ayurvedic Physician clearly

demonstrates to an admission of falsifying the medical register to place the

Applicant at an advantage. Such action not only puts into question the testimonial

trustworthiness of the witness but also the malicious intent to mislead the judicial

process in arriving at a just and equitable order, which both lower courts thought

fit to ignore.

[23] When judges are vested with the power to adjudicate under the premise of equity

and fairness, the decisions must be anchored in truth, good faith, and the law. The

exercise of this discretion is not unfettered, it must operate within the framework

of established legal principles and cannot be guided merely by sympathetic

considerations. As held in Richard Pieris & Co. Ltd. vs. D.J. Wijesiriwardena2 ,

"justice and equity can themselves be measured not according to the urgings of a

kind heart, but only within the framework of the law."

[24] As aptly stated in K. A. Munidasa Wattahena, Thalagaswala vs. Diya-

kithulkanda Co-operative Thrift & Credit Society Ltd3, this court does not

endeavor to re-assess or re-evaluate any facts unless and otherwise the Appellant

has satisfied the court that the learned President of the Labour Tribunal

overlooked or reached conclusions which were against the weight of the evidence,

or the conclusions reached were rationally impossible or perverse.

P a g e 9 | 14

[25] In the present case, the Appellant has sufficiently established that the Learned

President of the Labour Tribunal failed to properly consider the falsified evidence

presented by the Ayurvedic Physician and overlooked the clear admissions made

during cross-examination.

[26] As held in Ashok Somalal Thakkar and Anr. vs. State Of Gujarat4 The doctrine

falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus merely involves the question of weightage of

evidence which a Court may apply in a given set of circumstances and not a

mandatory rule of evidence, it has to apply in each case as to what extent the

evidence is worthy of acceptance, and merely because in some respects the Court

considers the same to be insufficient for placing reliance on the testimony of a

witness, it does not necessarily follow as a matter of rule that it must be

disregarded in all respects as well. But where it is not feasible to separate the truth

from falsehood, because grain and chaff are inextricably mixed up, and in the

process of separation an absolutely new case has to be reconstructed by divorcing

essential details presented by the prosecution completely from the context and the

background against which they are made, the only available course to be made is

to discard the evidence in toto.

[27] The Applicants narration of events pertaining to 03/09/2012 centers around his

inability to perform his duty as requested by the Respondent company, due to the

urgent need of taking his mother for treatment. The evidence before this Court

suggests that it was crucial for the Applicant to establish that his mother was taken

for treatment on 01/09/2012. On the advice of the Ayurvedic Physician the

treatment to continue every other day and 03/09/2012 was the next date the

Applicant had to take her for treatment.

[28] As previously highlighted, the inconsistency in the patient registers when

considered together with the Ayurvedic Physician's inability to recall whether the

4 2007CRILJ3579

P a g e 10 | 14

Applicant's mother was actually treated on the 1st of September, undermines the

credibility of the evidence. There is no reliable basis to establish that such

treatment occurred on the said date. Therefore, it is clear that the Labour Tribunal

failed to properly assess the medical register (X7) and the medical certificate (X4)

in their proper perspective, instead placing undue reliance on the Physician's

testimony, which was cluttered with falsehood.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer the first and third questions of law, in favor of

the Appellant.

[29] The Respondent also claims that on the date in question, the Applicant behaved in

an unruly manner using vituperative language against a director of the Appellant-

company. It is submitted that the evidence relating to the use of such language was

witnessed and testified to at the Tribunal by four employees of the Appellant-

company, of which, at least three witnesses admittedly were within close proximity

to the said incident. It is further contended that in the given circumstances, the use

of such language by the Applicant would not have given him no other choice but

to vacate his post.

[30] In Lanka Synthetic Fibre Co. Ltd vs. Perera 5, the Court found that Perera, who

was serving as an Assistant Security Officer, was found guilty of using abusive

language and physically assaulting his superior officer, during a disagreement

regarding the unauthorized removal of company property. This Court held that

such actions constituted serious misconduct, including neglect of duty, and a

breach of workplace discipline. It rejected the view of the High Court that the

incident was minor and exaggerated and held that the use of abusive language

towards a superior amount to a misconduct irrespective of the circumstances in

which it has been uttered.

5 1998 3SLR 19

P a g e 11 | 14

[31] In Wickramage Stanley Perera vs. National Police Commission and Others 6, the

Supreme Court clarified the legal definition and application of Vacation of

Employment. The Court held that it requires two essential elements: a physical

element and a mental element. The physical element refers to the employee's

unauthorized absence from work, while the mental element refers to the intention

to abandon employment. Both elements must co-exist for an employer to validly

consider an employee to have vacated their post. The Court cited Nelson de Silva

vs. Sri Lanka State Engineering Corporation (1996), and explained that physical

absence alone is insufficient to establish vacation of employment; the employer

must also prove the employees intention to abandon their duties.

[32] Evidence given by three employees/ witnesses in support of the contention that the

Applicant had used abusive language on the director of the Appellant-company

corroborates with each other.

[33] In this instance, the Applicants use of abusive and vituperative language towards a

director of the Appellant company within the bounds of his employment, goes

beyond mere misconduct and reflects a deliberate intention to sever the employer-

employee relationship. It is clear from the evidence that the Applicant has made an

explicit declaration that he no longer wished to continue work with the Appellant

company. During the argument with the director, the Applicant explicitly stated

that he "did not want to work here anymore" and added that he "could find many

other places to work for." This verbal admission is a clear and an unambiguous

expression of his intention to sever the employer-employee relationship. Such a

declaration made to a director, especially in the presence of fellow employees/

witnesses, cannot be considered as mere frustration or dissatisfaction. It is, rather

a decisive indication of voluntary abandonment of employment. After making this

declaration, he had slammed the vehicle key onto the table. These actions together,

6 SC FR/APPLICATION NO. 403/2016

P a g e 12 | 14

indicate a clear intention on the part of the employee to vacate his employment.

[34] As mentioned above in Lanka Synthetic Fibre Co. Ltd, acts of insubordination

and abusive language, towards superiors constitute grave misconduct warranting

termination. However, in the present case, the Applicant went further by not only

engaging in misconduct but also explicitly expressing his intention to leave and

returning the key of the vehicle back to the company.

When viewed in totality, the Applicant voluntarily abandoned his employment.

This was not a case of wrongful dismissal but one where the Applicant, through

his own words and deeds, clearly expressed his intention to terminate the

employment relationship.

[35] It is alleged by the Appellant, that the Labour Tribunal rejected the said evidence

stating that, the Appellant had the opportunity to hear the evidence presented by

the Applicant, and that it was a mere afterthought to change its defence to counter

the claim placed by the Applicant.

[36] The Labour Tribunal was of the view that the Appellant had thereafter

manufactured an entirely new defence and that the Applicant was not cross-

examined on the new position adopted by the Appellant.

[37] On evidence necessary and evidence tendered W.E.M. Abeysekara, commented

thus7;

Tendered evidence is subject to the rules of relevancy just as the requirement to

record such is no bar to the adjudicator calling in addition any necessary evidence.

The distinction between the two classes being subtle, in actual practice it becomes

difficult to firmly decide, from such of evidence that is tendered is necessary under

the principles of natural justice which are a sine-qua-non for a just and equitable

7 WEM Abeysekara, Industrial Law and Adjudication with Emphasis on the Industrial Disputes Act, vol 1 (1970) 257.

P a g e 13 | 14

award or order.

[38] In the answer tendered to the Labour Tribunal dated 23/10/2012, the Appellant had

precisely adverted to the above position. It is also observed that at least in three

separate instances the Appellant suggested this position to the Applicant in the

proceedings before the Labour Tribunal.

[40] In the case, The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. vs. National Employees'

Union8, this Court addressed whether strict pleadings are necessary in proceedings

before a Labour Tribunal. The Court held that statements filed by parties in Labour

Tribunal applications are not equivalent to pleadings in a civil action and in

determining what is "just and equitable" should be considered based on the

circumstances of the case.

[41] Proceedings in Labour Tribunals are considered to be more flexible when

compared with civil procedure, where pleadings strictly define the scope of the

case. The President of the Labour Tribunal is therefore obligated to consider all

relevant facts and evidence presented during the inquiry, even if such facts are not

explicitly stated in the initial statements filed by the parties. In the above case the

Court held that, the tribunal must look beyond the written statements to the totality

P a g e 14 | 14

of the evidence and circumstances of the dispute.

[42] For the foregoing reasons, I answer the second question of law also in favor of the

Appellant.

[43] Accordingly, the Appeal is allowed, and the Judgment of the High Court dated

03/03/2021 and the order of the Labour Tribunal dated 09/09/2016 are hereby set

aside.
