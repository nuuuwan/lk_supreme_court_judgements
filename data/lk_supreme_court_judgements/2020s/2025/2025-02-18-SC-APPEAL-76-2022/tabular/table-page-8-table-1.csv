"[21]","Equity, carries a fundamental maxim: ""He who seeks equity must come with clean"
"","hands."" This principle was established in the landmark case of Dering vs. Earl of"
"","Winchelsea1  and has  since been  consistently upheld as  an  integral  principle of"
"","equitable relief. Therefore, a party seeking the intervention of a Tribunal or Court"
"","on equitable grounds must demonstrate honesty and integrity in their conduct."
"[22]","The  said  deliberate misrepresentation made by  the  Ayurvedic Physician clearly"
"","demonstrates  to  an  admission  of  falsifying  the  medical  register  to  place  the"
"","Applicant at an advantage. Such action not only puts into question the testimonial"
"","trustworthiness of the witness but also the malicious intent to mislead the judicial"
"","process in arriving at a just and equitable order, which both lower courts th ought"
"","fit to ignore."
"[23]","When judges are vested with the power to adjudicate under the premise of equity"
"","and fairness, the decisions must be anchored in truth, good faith, and the law. The"
"","exercise of this discretion is not unfettered, it must operate within the framework"
"","of  established  legal  principles  and  cannot  be  guided  merely  by  sympathetic"
"","considerations. As held in Richard Pieris & Co.  Ltd. vs. D.J.  Wijesiriwardena2 ,"
"","""justice and equity can themselves be measured not according to the urgings of a"
"","kind heart, but only within the framework of the law."""

aptly  stated 
in  K.  A.  Munidasa  Wattahena,  Thalagaswala  vs.  Diya-"
"","kithulkanda  Co-operative Thrift  &  Credit Society  Ltd 3,  “…this  court does  not"
"","endeavor to re-assess or re-evaluate any facts unless and otherwise the Appellant"
"","has  satisfied  the  court 
that 
the 
learned  President  of 
the  Labour  Tribunal"
"","overlooked or reached conclusions which were against the weight of the evidence,"
"","or the conclusions reached were rationally impossible or perverse.”"
