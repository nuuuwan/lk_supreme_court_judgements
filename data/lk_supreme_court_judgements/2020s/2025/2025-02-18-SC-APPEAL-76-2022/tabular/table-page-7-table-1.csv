"[17]","In the above circumstances, the learned Counsel for the Appellant urged Court to"
"","disregard  the  evidence of  the  Ayurvedic  Physician which  creates a  substantial"
"","doubt to his credibility and his testimonial trustworthiness."
"[18]","When  evaluating  evidence on  falsification  of the  medical  register,  the  Labour"
"","Tribunal concludes that trustworthiness of the evidence should not be challenged"
"","on the scheme of registration of patients but on the evaluation of evidence given"
"","by the Ayurvedic Physician in its totality. However, neither the Tribunal nor the"
"","High  Court  made  any adverse finding on  a  clear admission in  evidence by  the"
"","Ayurvedic Physician of falsifying the medical register."
"[19]","It is also observed that the Labour Tribunal and the High  Court failed to examine"
"","the said evidence relating to the falsification of the medical register which weighed"
"","strongly on the presumption that it could have been carried out for the Applicant"
"","to construct a case to justify unjust termination of employment."
"[20]","In the circumstances, I find reason to address the first and third questions of law,"
"","together."
"","Section 31C(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act provides that “Where an application"
"","under section 31B is made to a Labour Tribunal, it shall be the duty of the tribunal"
"","to make all such inquiries into that application and hear all such evidence as the"
"","tribunal may  consider necessary, and thereafter make not later th an six months"
"","from the date of such application, such order as may appear to the tribunal to  be"
"","just and equitable” (emphasis added)."
