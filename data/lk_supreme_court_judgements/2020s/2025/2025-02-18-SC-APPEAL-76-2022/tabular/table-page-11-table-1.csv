"[31]","In Wickramage Stanley Perera vs. National Police Commission and Others 6, the"
"","Supreme  Court  clarified  the  legal  definition  and  application  of  Vacation  of"
"","Employment. The “Court held that it requires two essential elements: a physical"
"","element  and  a  mental  element.  The  physical element  refers  to  the  employee's"
"","unauthorized absence from work, while the mental element refers to the intention"
"","to abandon employment. Both elements must  co-exist for an employer to validly"
"","consider an employee to have vacated their post”. The Court cited Nelson de Silva"
"","vs. Sri Lanka State Engineering Corporation (1996), and explained that physical"
"","absence alone is  insufficient to establish vacation of employment; the employer"
"","must also prove the employee’s intention to abandon their duties."
"[32]","Evidence given by three employees/ witnesses in support of the contention that the"
"","Applicant had used abusive language  on the  director of the  Appellant-company"
"","corroborates with each other."
"[
33]","In this instance, the Applicants use of abusive and vituperative language towards a"
"","director of  the  Appellant company within  the  bounds of  his  employment,  goes"
"","beyond mere misconduct and reflects a deliberate intention to sever the employer-"
"","employee relationship. It is clear from the evidence that the Applicant has made an"
"","explicit declaration that he no longer wished to continue work with the Appellant"
"","company. During  the argument with  the director, the Applicant explicitly stated"
"","that he ""did not want to work here anymore"" and added tha t he ""could find many"
"","other places to work  for."" This  verbal admission is  a clear and  an unambiguous"
"","expression of his  intention to sever the employer-employee relationship. Such a"
"","declaration made  to  a  director, especially in  the presence of  fellow employees/"
"","witnesses, cannot be considered as mere frustration or dissatisfaction. It is, rather"
"","a decisive indication of voluntary abandonment of employment.  After making this"
"","declaration, he had slammed the vehicle key onto the table. These actions together,"
