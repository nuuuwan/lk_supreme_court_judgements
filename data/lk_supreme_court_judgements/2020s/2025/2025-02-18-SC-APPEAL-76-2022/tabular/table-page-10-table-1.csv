"","Applicant's mother was actually treated on the 1st of September, undermines the"
"","credibility  of  the  evidence.  There  is  no  reliable  basis  to  establish  that  such"
"","treatment occurred on the said date. Therefore, it is clear that the Labour Tribunal"
"","failed to properly assess the medical register (X7) and the medical certificate (X4)"
"","in  their  proper  perspective, instead  placing  undue  reliance  on  the  Physician's"
"","testimony, which was cluttered with falsehood."
"","For the foregoing reasons, I answer the first and third questions of law, in favor of"
"","the Appellant."
"[29]","The Respondent also claims that on the date in question, the Applicant behaved in"
"","an unruly manner using vituperative language against a  director of the Appellant-"
"","company. It is submitted that the evidence relating to the use of such language was"
"","witnessed and  testified to  at  the  Tribunal  by  four  employees of  the  Appellant-"
"","company, of which, at least three witnesses admittedly were within close proximity"
"","to the said incident. It is further contended that in the given circumstances, the use"
"","of such language by the Applicant would not have given him no other choice but"
"","to vacate his post."
"[30]","In Lanka Synthetic  Fibre Co.  Ltd vs. Perera 5,  the Court found that Perera, who"
"","was  serving as an Assistant Security Officer, was  found guilty  of using abusive"
"","language  and  physically assaulting  his  superior officer,  during  a  disagreement"
"","regarding  the  unauthorized  removal of company  property. This  Court  held that"
"","such  actions  constituted serious  misconduct,  including  neglect  of  duty,  and  a"
"","breach of  workplace discipline. It  rejected the  view  of  the  High  Court  that the"
"","incident was  minor  and  exaggerated and  held  that the  use  of  abusive language"
"","towards a  superior amount to  a misconduct irrespective  of the circumstances in"
"","which it has been uttered."
