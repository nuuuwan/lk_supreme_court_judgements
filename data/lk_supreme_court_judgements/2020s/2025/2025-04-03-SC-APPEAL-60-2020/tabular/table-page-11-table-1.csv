"7, and 8 were each below the minimum extent required by the Regulations for"
"development   purposes.  Yet,   even   when   combined,   the   total   extent   of   these"
"three lots would still not meet the required minimum extent of six perches."
"Nevertheless, if these lots are sold as a single lot, bidders would likely offer a"
"better price at the sale, or the Defendants to whom the adjoining Lots 6 and 9"
"have been allotted may even choose to purchase them."
"The   Commissioner   appears   to   have   acted   in   the   best   possible   manner   by"
"allotting   the   improvements   claimed   by   each   party   during   the   preliminary"
"survey. In fact, the contesting party, the Plaintiff -Petitioner, was allotted 17.5"
"perches   in   Lot   No.   1,   which   is   0.5   perches   more   than   the   17   perches   she"
"originally claimed during the preliminary survey."
"Since buildings are situated on each lot adjacent to one another, it is evident"
"that no scheme of partition could be prepared in a way that accommodates each"
"party’s entitlement from a single lot. This view is further supported by the"
"alternative plan submitted by the Plaintiff–Petitioner, which was prepared by"
"Mr. L. P. Liyanage, Licensed Surveyor."
"Hence, as suggested by Mr. Lasitha Kanuwanaarachchi, the learned Counsel"
"for   the   2A  Defendant–Respondent,   the   only   practicable   way   to   make   the"
"Commissioner’s scheme of partition viable is to relocate Lot No. 5, which is"
"currently situated along the Northern boundary of Lot No. 6, to the Southern"
"part of Lot No. 6 and to merge the existing Lot No. 5 with Lot No. 6."
"This course of action is not repugnant to the Partition Law. Our courts have"
"time   and   again   observed   that   the   phrase  ""the   court   shall,   after   a   summary"
"inquiry, confirm such scheme with or without modifications"" in Section 37 (2)"
"of   the   Partition   Law   should   not   be   interpreted   as   permitting   only   minor"
"alterations. In confirming the scheme, the trial judge has the discretion to adopt"
"the partition scheme prepared by the Commissioner, with any modifications he"
"considers justified."
"I   note   that   the   Plaintiff–Petitioner's   intention   in   submitting   an   alternative"
"scheme of partition was revealed through the testimony of his own surveyor,"
