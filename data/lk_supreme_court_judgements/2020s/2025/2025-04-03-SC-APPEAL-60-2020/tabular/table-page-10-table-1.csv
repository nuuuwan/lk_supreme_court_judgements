"Regulations. Reducing Lot No. 7 by 1.5 perches would further diminish its"
"extent from 3.02 perches to 1.52 perches, which would still not conform to the"
"Regulations. Moreover, such a reduction would further limit its viability for"
"agricultural or horticultural use, apart from development."
"In the alternative plan, Licensed Surveyor Mr. L.P. Liyanage reallocated 1.5"
"perches   from   Lot   No.   7   to   the   Plaintiff-Petitioner’s   Lot   No.   1,   where   she"
"resides, by carving out a small strip of land from Lot No. 2, which had been"
"allotted to the 1st Defendant–Respondent–Respondent–Respondent (hereinafter"
"referred to as the ""1st Defendant – Respondent"")."
"This   adjustment,   if   allowed,   would   reduce   the   effective   enjoyment   of   the"
"backyard of the 1st Defendant - Respondent’s dwelling house, which is situated"
"within Lot No. 2. Additionally, it would result in both the Plaintiff - Petitioner’s"
"Lot No. 1 and the 1st Defendant - Respondent’s Lot No. 2 being reshaped into"
"irregular and impractical configurations."
"I do concede that the plan prepared by Commissioner Mr. M. Gamini D. Peiris"
"is not in conformity with the Regulations. Not only is Lot No. 7, allotted to the"
"Plaintiff -Petitioner, below the required extent, but Lot No. 5, allotted to the 1 st"
"Defendant -Respondent, and Lot No. 8, allotted to the 2nd  and 3rd  Defendant"
"-Respondent -Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the “2nd and"
"3rd  Defendant   -Respondents”),   each   measure   only   1.39   perches,   which   also"
"fails to meet the required standards."
"Although   the   1st  to   3rd  Defendant-Respondents   did   not   raise   any   objection"
"regarding their respective allocations, the fact remains that such allocations are"
"in violation of the Regulations and cannot be permitted to stand under the"
"Partition Law."
"In   terms   of   Section   31(2)   of   the   Partition   Law   No.   21   of   1977,   the"
"Commissioner, Mr. M. Gamini D. Peiris, should have, as far as practicable,"
"divided the land in a manner that would allow for the allotment or sale of such"
"portions as a single lot. This was particularly necessary given that Lots No. 5,"
