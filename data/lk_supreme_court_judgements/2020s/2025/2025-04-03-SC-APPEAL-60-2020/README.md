This is an application seeking leave to appeal against the judgment of the High

Court of the Civil Appeals of the Western Province, holden at Kalutara,

delivered on June 11, 2018, in an appeal challenging the order of the learned

District Judge of Panadura, made on May 12, 2017.

The Plaintiff-Petitioner-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiff-Petitioner) instituted Partition Action No. P/866 in the District Court

of Panadura, seeking partition of the land known as Damminnagahawatta

SC/APPEAL/0060/2020 6

alias Daminagahawatta, morefully described in the schedule to the plaint,

naming five Defendants.

As per the plaint, the Plaintiff sought to partition the corpus among the

Plaintiff and the 1st to 4th Defendants in the following proportions: 12/48 shares

to the Plaintiff, 9/48 shares each to the 1st to 4th Defendants, and 9/48 shares to

remain unallotted. The 5th Defendant was named as a party on the basis that she

was in possession of a portion of the corpus.

Following the preliminary survey of the corpus and the filing of statements of

claim by the Defendants, the case proceeded to trial.

After trial, the learned District Judge delivered judgment on April 19, 2005,

allotting shares of the corpus to the parties as stated in the plaint. An

interlocutory decree was accordingly entered, and a Commission was issued to

Licensed Surveyor and Court Commissioner, Mr. Gamini Peiris, to prepare the

final scheme of partition.

The Commissioner, upon executing the Commission, submitted Plan No. 2662

along with his report dated September 18, 2013. In accordance with the plan,

the corpus was divided, and the parties were allotted specific lots as follows.

(a) Lot 1 (17.5 perches) and Lot 7 (3.02 perches) to the Plaintiff-

Petitioner.;

(b) Lot 2 (14.00 perches) and Lot 5 (1.39 perches) to the 1st Defendant-

Respondent (deceased wife of the 4th Defendant - Respondent);

(c) Lot 3 (14.00 perches) and Lot 8 (1.39 perches) to the 2nd and 3rd

Defendant - Respondents;

(d) Lot No. 4 (15.39 perches) to 4th Defendant - Respondent;

(e) Lot No. 6 (9.09 perches) and Lot No. 9 (6.30 perches) - unallotted.

The Plaintiff-Petitioner, being dissatisfied with the proposed scheme of

partition, filed a Petition dated January 27, 2014, supported by an affidavit,

along with an alternative scheme of partition depicted in Plan No. 816, dated

November 14, 2013, prepared by L.P. Liyanage, Licensed Surveyor.SC/APPEAL/0060/2020 7

The 4th Defendant-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to

as the "4th Defendant-Respondent") filed a statement of objections dated

November 25, 2016, supported by an affidavit, opposing the alternative scheme

of partition proposed by the Plaintiff -Petitioner.

Consequently, the learned District Judge of Panadura conducted an inquiry into

the matter. At the inquiry, the Plaintiff-Petitioner, Licensed Surveyor Mr. L.P.

Liyanage, and the 4th Defendant - Respondent gave evidence.

The learned District Judge, after inquiring into the scheme of partition, has

ordered the sale of amalgamated Lots No. 7 and 8 as a single lot and the sale of

Lot No. 5 initially, among the parties to the partition action. If no party to the

action bids or if the bids are below the valuation, the lots were ordered to be

offered to outsiders. The learned District Judge has further ordered that the

proceeds of the auction be distributed among the parties who were allocated

shares in those three lots, in proportion to the shares specified in the judgment.

Subject to these directives, the learned District Judge confirmed the

Commissioners Plan No. 2662, dated September 13, 2013.

Against this order, the Plaintiff-Petitioner sought leave to appeal from the Civil

Appellate High Court of Kalutara. The learned Judges of the High Court

initially granted leave to appeal from the said order1. However, by judgment

dated June 11, 2018, they refused the appeal presented by the Plaintiff-

Petitioner. Thereafter the present application to this Court was made where this

Court granted leave on the two questions of law set out in paragraphs 34 (A)

(iii) and 34 (C) of the petition, which reads in verbatim as follows:

(1) Paragraph 34 (A)(ii):

Has the learned District Judge erred in law by his failure to take into

consideration the fact that Mr. Gamini Peiris, the Licensed Surveyor

who made his return to the commission in the present case and whose

scheme of partition was confirmed by the Order of the learned District

Judge after the scheme inquiry had failed to comply with Section 31(2)

1 Order dated June 22,2017.SC/APPEAL/0060/2020 8

of the Partition Law 22 (sic) of 1977 in that he had not divided the land

so far as practicable in such a manner as would enable the allotment or

sale of Lot 5,Lot 7 and Lot 8 as one lot although the extent of each one

of them are less than the minimum extent required by written law

regulating the subdivision of land for development purposes?

(2) Paragraph 34 (C):

Have the learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeals of the

Western Province holden at Kalutara and the learned District Judge of

Panadura erred in law by his failure to take into consideration the fact

that Mr. Gamini Peiris, the Licensed Surveyor who made his return to

the commission in the present case and whose scheme of partition was

confirmed by the Order of the learned District Judge after the scheme

inquiry had failed to comply with Section 31(2) of the Partition Law

No:22 (sic) of 1977, in that he had not divided the land so far as

practicable in such a manner as would enable the allotment or sale of

Lot 5, Lot 7 and Lot 8 as one lot although the extent of each one of them

are less than the minimum extent required by written law regulating the

subdivision of land for development purposes?

Since both questions of law are pertaining to the same matter, I will address them simultaneously.

During her testimony at the scheme inquiry, the Plaintiff Petitioner has stated

that the extent of Lot No. 7 allotted to her was only 3.02 perches, which was

less than the minimum extent required by the Local Government Authority for

the subdivision of land under the Urban Development Authority Planning and

Building Regulations. She has contended that if 1.5 perches were deducted

from Lot No. 7 and added to Lot No. 1, she would be able to utilize Lot No. 1

more effectively, particularly as it is the area where she resides.

However, I find no logical basis for her statement, as her initial complaint to

the District Court, on which the learned District Judge initiated the inquiry, was

that Lot No. 7 had been allotted to her in violation of the applicable

SC/APPEAL/0060/2020 9

Regulations. Reducing Lot No. 7 by 1.5 perches would further diminish its

extent from 3.02 perches to 1.52 perches, which would still not conform to the

Regulations. Moreover, such a reduction would further limit its viability for

agricultural or horticultural use, apart from development.

In the alternative plan, Licensed Surveyor Mr. L.P. Liyanage reallocated 1.5

perches from Lot No. 7 to the Plaintiff-Petitioners Lot No. 1, where she

resides, by carving out a small strip of land from Lot No. 2, which had been

allotted to the 1st DefendantRespondentRespondentRespondent (hereinafter

referred to as the "1st Defendant Respondent").

This adjustment, if allowed, would reduce the effective enjoyment of the

backyard of the 1st Defendant - Respondents dwelling house, which is situated

within Lot No. 2. Additionally, it would result in both the Plaintiff - Petitioners

Lot No. 1 and the 1st Defendant - Respondents Lot No. 2 being reshaped into

irregular and impractical configurations.

I do concede that the plan prepared by Commissioner Mr. M. Gamini D. Peiris

is not in conformity with the Regulations. Not only is Lot No. 7, allotted to the

Plaintiff -Petitioner, below the required extent, but Lot No. 5, allotted to the 1st

Defendant -Respondent, and Lot No. 8, allotted to the 2nd and 3rd Defendant

-Respondent -Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd and

3rd Defendant -Respondents), each measure only 1.39 perches, which also

fails to meet the required standards.

Although the 1st to 3rd Defendant-Respondents did not raise any objection

regarding their respective allocations, the fact remains that such allocations are

in violation of the Regulations and cannot be permitted to stand under the

Partition Law.

In terms of Section 31(2) of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977, the

Commissioner, Mr. M. Gamini D. Peiris, should have, as far as practicable,

divided the land in a manner that would allow for the allotment or sale of such

portions as a single lot. This was particularly necessary given that Lots No. 5,

SC/APPEAL/0060/2020 10

7, and 8 were each below the minimum extent required by the Regulations for

development purposes. Yet, even when combined, the total extent of these

three lots would still not meet the required minimum extent of six perches.

Nevertheless, if these lots are sold as a single lot, bidders would likely offer a

better price at the sale, or the Defendants to whom the adjoining Lots 6 and 9

have been allotted may even choose to purchase them.

The Commissioner appears to have acted in the best possible manner by

allotting the improvements claimed by each party during the preliminary

survey. In fact, the contesting party, the Plaintiff -Petitioner, was allotted 17.5

perches in Lot No. 1, which is 0.5 perches more than the 17 perches she

originally claimed during the preliminary survey.

Since buildings are situated on each lot adjacent to one another, it is evident

that no scheme of partition could be prepared in a way that accommodates each

partys entitlement from a single lot. This view is further supported by the

alternative plan submitted by the PlaintiffPetitioner, which was prepared by

Mr. L. P. Liyanage, Licensed Surveyor.

Hence, as suggested by Mr. Lasitha Kanuwanaarachchi, the learned Counsel

for the 2A DefendantRespondent, the only practicable way to make the

Commissioners scheme of partition viable is to relocate Lot No. 5, which is

currently situated along the Northern boundary of Lot No. 6, to the Southern

part of Lot No. 6 and to merge the existing Lot No. 5 with Lot No. 6.

This course of action is not repugnant to the Partition Law. Our courts have

time and again observed that the phrase "the court shall, after a summary

inquiry, confirm such scheme with or without modifications" in Section 37 (2)

of the Partition Law should not be interpreted as permitting only minor

alterations. In confirming the scheme, the trial judge has the discretion to adopt

the partition scheme prepared by the Commissioner, with any modifications he

considers justified.

I note that the PlaintiffPetitioner's intention in submitting an alternative

scheme of partition was revealed through the testimony of his own surveyor,

SC/APPEAL/0060/2020 11

Mr. L.P. Liyanage, Licensed Surveyor. In response to a question posed on

behalf of the 4th DefendantRespondent regarding the Plaintiff Petitioners

grievance, he stated that the Plaintiff had instructed him to make room for the

construction of a washroom.

I am of the view that such a need of an individual party should not be a

determining factor in the scheme of partition in this case.

It is settled law that in a partition action, the Commissioners scheme of

partition should not be lightly rejected2. However, in this instance, the

Commissioner in allotting Lot No 5,7, and 8 to the 1st Defendant-Respondent,

Plaintiff-Petitioner and 2nd and 3rd Defendant-Respondents has acted in

violation of a statutory provision in the Partition Law; specifically, Section

31(2).

Hence, I order the relocation of Lot No. 5 along the Southern boundary of Lot

No. 6 and merger of existing Lot No. 5 with Lot No. 6. Even to the naked eye,

it is easy to perceive that Lot No. 5. can be re-located to the Southern boundary

of Lot No. 6, if necessary, with a slight alteration in the shape. I issue this

direction since if this matter is sent back to the District Court for the re-

consideration of alterations, it could allow a party to re-agitate the same issue

through legal channels, potentially prolonging the proceedings, even reaching

this Court again, a process that has already spanned twelve years since the final

scheme of partition.

In light of the above analysis, I find no reason to interfere with the impugned

order of the learned District Judge dated May 12, 2017, and of the learned

Judges of the High Court except for the modification ordered by this Court

regarding Lot No. 5.

In this case, unlike in an ordinary case, it is possible to include a special

direction for the sale of Lots No 5,7 and 8 in the interlocutory decree since this

order is made after the preparation of the scheme of partition.

2Appuhamy v. Weeratunge 46 N.L.R. p. 461 and Gunasekara v. Soothanona [1988] 2 SLR 8.

SC/APPEAL/0060/2020 12

The learned District Judge is directed to issue a Commission to the

Commissioner to modify the final scheme of partition in accordance with the

order of this Court. As per Section 26(2)(b) of the Partition Law, the

interlocutory decree may contain an order for sale of the entirety of the corpus

or a share or a divided lot. Therefore, the learned District Judge is directed to

enter an interlocutory decree, giving effect to this order, before issuing the

commission for the modified scheme of partition. Furthermore, the learned

District Judge shall make the necessary orders under Sections 38 to 42

concerning the auction of Lots No. 5, 7, and 8, which the Commissioner must

depict as a single lot.

Hence, I answer in the affirmative the two questions of law on which this Court

granted leave to appeal.

Accordingly, the appeal is partially allowed subject to the aforementioned

direction. The parties shall bear their own costs.
