"SC Appeal No. 159/23"
"of the Penal Code as amended by the Act no.22 of 1995, the relevant part of which reads as"
"follows:"
"“
Whoever, by assault or use of criminal force, sexually harasses another person, or by the use"
"of words or actions, causes sexual annoyance or harassment to such other person, commits the"
"offence of sexual harassment …”"
"C
an  the  mere  presence  of  semen  of  the  Accused  on  the  undergarment  establish  assault  or"
"criminal force? The answer should be in the Negative. It needs some more facts to be proved."
"On  the  other  hand,  harassment  and  annoyance  contemplated  in  the  said  Section  cannot  be"
"established unless it is established that it was done without consent or against the wishes of the"
"person who was subjected to the offense. Mere presence of semen does not establish a prima"
"facie case against the Accused that it is a result of an act done against the Deceased’s consent"
"or wishes."
"A
s stated in Ajith v Attorney General (supra), the burden of proving the offence is always on"
"the prosecution."
"I
 would prefer to consider the possible inferences that can be made based on the presence of"
"Accused’s  semen  on  the  undergarments  of  the  Deceased,  Jeong.  In  my  view,  the  possible"
"inference would be that ejaculation of the Accused’s semen happened in very close proximity"
"to the undergarments of the Deceased, Jeong, or that those undergarments were used to wipe"
"away the semen of the Accused by someone; it may be the Accused or the Deceased or someone"
"else. However, this does not establish that there was sexual assault, criminal force, or that the"
"sexual act or advance was against her consent or wishes. Without those being established, there"
"cannot be a prima facie case to call for defence."
"A
s suggested by the Prosecution, it could have happened against the consent or wishes of the"
"Deceased  or  by  using  criminal  force,  but  at  the  same  time  it  could  have  happened  as  a"
"consensual act. The Prosecution has not been able to place any reliable evidence to vitiate the"
"possibility of the latter, namely the consent or willingness of the Deceased."
"T
he learned SASG contended that as per Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance when any fact"
"is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him."
