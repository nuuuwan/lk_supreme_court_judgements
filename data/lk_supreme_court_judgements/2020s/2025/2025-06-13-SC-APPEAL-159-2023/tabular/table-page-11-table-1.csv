"SC Appeal No. 159/23"
"shall record verdict of acquittal ; if however the Judge considers that there are grounds for"
"proceeding with the trial he shall call upon the accused for his defence.”"
"I
t is the view of this Court that the Prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case as the"
"evidence led at the Trial fails to establish the commission of the offence charged against the"
"Accused in the indictment or of any other offence of which he might be convicted on such"
"indictment as it cannot be inferred as per the evidence led that it was the Accused who removed"
"the undergarments of the Deceased as stated in the charge indicating the mode of commission"
"of the offence as well as, irrespective of the removal of the undergarment, it cannot be inferred"
"that the semen of the Accused came in contact with the undergarments of the Deceased without"
"her consent or against her wishes or willingness. Thus, the learned high Court Judge’s decision"
"not to call defence is correct and approval of that decision by the Court of Appeal is also correct."
"I
  do  not  think  that  there  was  any  issue  with  regard  to  the  number  of  witnesses  called  or"
"reliability of the witnesses called as indirectly contended by the learned SASG. Even the R-v-"
"Galbraith (1981) 73 Cr. App. R124 cited by the learned SASG, states that when there is no"
"evidence that the crime alleged has been committed by the accused the Judge has to stop the"
"case. Even as per the Sri Lankan case Attorney-General v Baranage (2003) 1 Sri L R 340,"
"before calling for the defence, the Judge is entitled to consider the probability of the prosecution"
"case, the weight of evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the proven facts."
"After considering them, if the Judge sees that there is no prima facie case to call the defence,"
"calling defence becomes a futile exercise as he cannot rely on the Prosecution’s case as to the"
"proof of the charge."
"I
t is not the function of a Criminal Court to call for defence to fill the gaps of the Prosecution."
"The charge has to be proved by the Prosecution, and to call for defence, there must be prima"
"facie case for the prosecution. In the matter at hand, as discussed above, the Prosecution failed"
"to prove the contents of the charge as well as the lack of consent or willingness of the Deceased"
"for the alleged sexual act."
"A
s per the reasons discussed above, I answer the questions of law (a), (b), and (c) mentioned"
"above in the negative and the question of law (e) in the affirmative."
