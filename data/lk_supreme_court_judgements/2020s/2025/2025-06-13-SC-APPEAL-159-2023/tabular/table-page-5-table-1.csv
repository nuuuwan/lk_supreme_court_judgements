"SC Appeal No. 159/23"
"L.R. 01, which held that when a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence, the"
"proved items of circumstantial evidence, when taken together, must irresistibly point towards"
"the  fact  that  the  accused  committed  the  offence.  It  was  further  held:  “Therefore,  if  upon  a"
"consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if the only inference that can be"
"drawn is that accused committed the offence then they can be found guilty. That is not all, the"
"prosecution  must  prove  that  no  one  else  other  than  the  accused  had  the  opportunity  of"
"committing the offence. Therefore, the accused can be found guilty only and only if the proved"
"items  of  circumstantial  evidence  is  consistent  with  their  guilt  and  inconsistent  with  their"
"innocence” - at Pg 6- 7."
