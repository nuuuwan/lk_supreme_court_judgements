"SC Appeal No. 159/23"
"on the lane running from Daegu to Masan, on the early morning of 17.10.1998. Her death was"
"due to a Motor Traffic accident that happened on the expressway and the cause of death was a"
"rupture of the brain. Even though her body was clothed, her under garments were not found on"
"the body and later on the same day, those undergarments, namely underpants with a sanitary"
"pad  attached  to  it  and  a  girdle,  were  found  about  100  meters  away  from  the  place  of  the"
"accident. DNA analysis confirmed that the blood on the sanitary pad matched with the Victim"
"of  the  accident,  Jeong.  Further,  expert  evidence  confirmed  the  presence  of  semen  on  the"
"underpants and girdle, which was established to be the semen of the accused by DNA analysis."

"any sexual harassment. There were 157 proposed agreed facts at the Trial, and the Accused,"
"through his Counsel, admitted all but except item 50 and matters incidental to that item. Thus,"
"the learned High Court Judge correctly recorded all those proposed agreed facts as admissions"

"garments, he engaged in any sexual act against the consent or wishes of the Deceased, Jeong."
"I do not think, this will be changed even when one considers item 50 and 51 which were not"
"considered as admitted facts. Recovery of the undergarments with semen of the Accused, away"
"from the Deceasedâ€™s dead body, does not suggest that those undergarments were removed by"
