"SC Appeal No. 159/23"
"Judgment is sufficient to confirm the conclusion of the learned High Court Judge not to call"
"for defence."
"H
owever, it appears that the learned High Court Judges concentration was more on the aspect"
"of  criminal  force.  This  would  have  happened  due  to  the  nature  of  the  charge  framed.  The"
"Charge complained of an act of removing underpants which needs a physical force used against"
"the purported Victim of the crime. As per the interpretation contained in Section 341 of the"
"Penal Code for the term ‘Criminal Force’, it is apparent that lack of consent of the purported"
"victim is a must. As per the interpretation given to the word ‘Assault’ in Section 342 of the"
"Penal  Code,  it  is  clear  that  the  ‘gesture  or  preparation’  of  the  perpetrator  must  give  the"
"impression that he is about to use ‘Criminal Force’ against the victim of the crime. Thus, it also"
"refers to something that would happen against the consent of the purported victim. What is"
"more important is the two words ‘annoyance or harassment’ found in Section 345 of the Penal"
"Code, of which section the relevant portion is quoted below in this Judgment. These two words"
"innately indicate that the offensive act has to be done against the consent or wishes or likings"
"or expectations (hereinafter these mental elements will be referred to as ‘against the consent or"
"wishes’ or ‘without the consent or wishes’ or by using similar terms) of the purported victim."
"Thus, there is always a mental element involved in proving the offence contained in Section"
"345 of the Penal Code. If the alleged offense contains a mental element, it has to be proved by"
"the  Prosecution.  The  learned  SASG  attempts  to  contend  that  the  concept  of  ‘volenti  non  fit"
"injuria’ contained in Section 80 of the Penal Code under the General Exceptions applies, and,"
"as per Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance, it is the Accused who must prove that there was"
"consent. However, it applies to situations where the party who suffers harm has given consent,"
"expressly or impliedly, to suffer such harm. However, when the elements of the offence contain"
"a mental element, as the offense has to be proved by the Prosecution, that mental element also"
"has to be proved by the Prosecution. To call for defense, as the learned SASG contends, at least"
"there must be a prima facie case placed before the Judge including facts relevant to such mental"
"elements before the Judge. If mere presence of semen on a dress is sufficient to prove a sexual"
"offence, no sexual relationship is safe before law."
"T
he factual matrix indicates that Jeong, the Victim of the Accident, was student studying at"
"Keimyung University. She was last seen leaving the said University premises at about 10.30"
"pm on 16.10.1998 where a function took place and she consumed alcohol. Later, her body was"
"found on Guma Expressway about 300 hundred meters away from the Nam Daegu interchange,"
