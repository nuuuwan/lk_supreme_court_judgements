At all times material to this application, the 1st Petitioner was a minor aged 16 years and

8 months. He was a student at CP/Katu/Dehideniya Muslim Maha Vidyalaya and had just

completed the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination. The 1st and 2nd Respondents were

attached to the Hatharaliyadda Police Station. The 1st Respondent was the Acting Officer-

in-Charge. The 3rd Respondent is named as the Officer-in-Charge of the Hatharaliyadda

Police Station.

The events leading to this application arose from an alleged theft of jewellery from the

house of one Ajmeel, who is the cousin of the 1st Petitioner and lives in a house on the

same plot of land as the 1st Petitioners house a few meters away. The 1st Petitioner was

arrested by the 1st Respondent in relation to this incident and produced before the

Galagedera Magistrates Court in Case No. 9068/23. The 1st Petitioner was acquitted after

trial.

In this application, the 1st Petitioner is impugning his wrongful arrest, torture and

detention by the 1st to 3rd Respondents. Leave to proceed has been granted under Articles

11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution.

Article 11

In Channa Peiris and Others v. Attorney General and Others [(1994) 1 Sri LR 1] it was

held that having regard to the nature and gravity of the issue, a high degree of certainty

is required before the balance of probability might be said to tilt in favour of a petitioner

endeavouring to discharge his burden of proving that he was subjected to torture or to

cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.

According to the 1st Petitioner, he was first tortured on 06.08.2022 during interrogation

by the 1st Respondent. Upon the 1st Petitioner refusing to confess to the alleged offence,

the 1st Respondent struck the soles of his feet several times with a large pole about 1

inches in diameter and one meter long. The 1st Respondent directed another police officer

to hold the 1st Petitioners legs stretched out during this assault so that the soles of his

feet were within easy reach of the pole.

The 1st Petitioner shouted continuously that he did not take the jewellery and pleaded

with the 1st Respondent not to beat him. However, the 1st Respondent mocked him that

the punishment the 1st Respondent meted out to the 1st Petitioner will be worse than the

punishment he will get from Allah.

Page 4 of 13

After the assault, the 1st Respondent got the 1st Petitioner to walk about in the room and

jump up and down several times so as to inflict more pain.

The 1st Petitioner was tortured for the second time on 08.08.2022. Once again the 1st

Respondent got another police officer to hold the legs of the 1st Petitioner outstretched

while he struck the soles in a similar manner to the assault on 06.08.2022.

Later in the same day, a similar assault took place. This was followed by the 1st Respondent

crushing some nai miris on a handkerchief, then mixing it with water and squeezing the

nai miris extract into the eyes of the 1st Petitioner.

The narrative of the 1st Petitioner is corroborated by the medical evidence. On 09.08.2022,

he was admitted to the National Hospital of Kandy after obtaining bail. The diagnosis card

states assault as the principal diagnosis. The 1st Petitioner was referred to the Medical

Officer Legal Medicine. The Medico-Legal Report contains the following details on the

nature, size, shape, disposition and site of injury:

1. Blue coloured contusion, placed at the left sole in which the center of the contusion

was placed 8 cm above the heel and 3 cm away from the medial border of the sole.

2. Blue coloured contusion, placed at the right sole in which the center of the

contusion was placed 15 cm below the big toe and 4 cm away from the medial

border of the sole.

It appears that the 1st Respondent had attempted to prepare a narrative explaining the

injuries on the sole of the 1st Petitioner. In his notes dated 09.08.2022, the 1st Respondent

states that the 1st Petitioner tried to escape by running over some rocks no sooner he saw

the 1st Respondent on 08.08.2022 and as such he had to put handcuffs on the 1st

Petitioner.

However, as the Petitioners correctly submit, the notes of the 1st Respondent from the

previous date, i.e. 08.08.2022 depicts the 1st Petitioner as having being compliant and

Page 5 of 13

makes no mention of an attempt to escape. I also observe that the 1st Respondent in his

evidence before the Magistrate merely states that the 1st Petitioner tried to avoid him

when he had first seen the 1st Respondent.

Upon a consideration of all the foregoing circumstances, I have no hesitation in holding

that the 1st Petitioner has proved that the 1st Respondent has infringed his fundamental

rights guaranteed by Article 11 of the Constitution by torturing him both physically and

mentally.

The 2nd Petitioner claims that her fundamental right guaranteed by Article 11 of the

Constitution has been infringed by the torture of the 1st Petitioner. Of course, she had not

seen the torture. However, she has testified of the deprivation of seeing the 1st Petitioner

at the Police Station although she had sought for an opportunity. Moreover, when she

went to the Police Station on 08.08.2022 at around 2.00 p.m., the 1st Petitioner caught a

glimpse of the 2nd Petitioner and called out in Tamil to save him. The 2nd Petitioner heard

the screams of her son but was forced to leave by an unidentified Police Officer.

A mothers love and feelings for a minor child, and for that matter, any child is boundless.

The sayings and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, known as hadiths, underscore the

significance of a mothers love.

Imam Hakims al-Mustadrak (Vol. 2, p114) Narration 2502:

:

. : : :

It was narrated from Muawiyah bin Jahimah, that Jahimah came to the Prophet and

said: I want to go out on military expedition so I have come to ask your advice. He ()

said: Do you have a mother? He said: Yes. He () said: Go and be with her because

Paradise is at her feet.'

Page 6 of 13

As Buddha preached:

Even as a mother protects with her life her child, her only child,

So with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings

- Karaniya Metta Sutta, Sutta Nipata 143-151

The 2nd Petitioner, as the mother of the 1st Petitioner, a minor, had a legitimate expectation

to be afforded access to her child, particularly during a period of custodial detention. It is

evident from the material placed before this Court that such access was denied, causing

her considerable emotional distress. The 2nd Petitioner, having endured the natural

physical and emotional demands of pregnancy and childbirth, was placed in a position

where she was unable to render support or comfort to her minor son during a moment of

acute vulnerability.

The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that the 2nd Petitioner was compelled

to leave the police premises, despite the audible and urgent pleas of the 1st Petitioner,

who was calling out for his mothers intervention. This experience, by its very nature,

would be deeply distressing to any parent, and particularly to a mother who was rendered

helpless in the face of her childs visible anguish.

While the Court is mindful of the symbolic impartiality represented by Lady Justice, the

principle of human dignity requires that such instances of emotional trauma, particularly

involving a minor and his parent, are not overlooked. The psychological impact on the 2nd

Petitioner, arising from the events as presented, cannot be disregarded and must be

acknowledged as part of the broader context of the 2nd Petitioners grievance.

It is trite law that Article 11 encompasses both physical and psychological elements [See

Mrs. W.M.K. de Silva v. Chairman, Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation (1989) 2 Sri LR 393;

Adhikary and Another v. Amarasinghe and Another [(2003) 1 Sri LR 270; Dilshan

Page 7 of 13

Tilekeratne (minor) and Another v. Seargent Douglas Ellepola and Others (S.C.F.R.

578/2011, S.C.M. 14.01.2016].

There can be no doubt that the 2nd Petitioner was subjected to mental torture by the

forgoing circumstances.

I hold that the 1st Respondent has infringed the fundamental rights of the 2nd Petitioner

guaranteed by Article 11 of the Constitution.

Article 13(1)

Article 13 (1) of the Constitution states that no person shall be arrested except according

to procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the reason for

his arrest.

This provision has two parts. The first prescribes that an arrest must be done according to

lawful procedure, while the second requires that the reasons for the arrest must be

informed.

In the assessment of any violation under Article 13 (1), the questions that arise are 1) if

there was an arrest, if so, 2) whether the arrest was made according to the procedure

established by law, and 3) if the reasons for the arrest were informed to the person

arrested at the time of arrest.

Admittedly, the 1st Petitioner was arrested. The question then is whether the proper

procedure was followed in making the arrest.

In Channa Peiris [supra. at 27] it was held that:

The procedure generally established by law for arresting a person without a

warrant are set out in Chapter IV B (Sections 32-43) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure. Where a person is arrested without a warrant otherwise than in

accordance with these provisions, Article 13(1) of the Constitution will be violated.

Page 8 of 13

Section 32 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Code) specifies several instances where any

Police Officer may without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant arrest any

person. In Mohamed Razik Mohamed Ramzy v. B.M.A.S.K. Senaratne and Others

[S.C.F.R. Application No. 135/2020, S.C.M. 14.11.2023 at pages 41-42], my learned

brother Kodagoda, P.C., J. examined the scope of Section 32(1)(b) of the Code and held as

follows:

When separated into its constituent ingredients, section 32(1)(b) can be depicted

in the following manner:

Any peace officer may

without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant

arrest any person

(a) who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or

(b) against whom

(i) a reasonable complaint has been made

or

(ii) credible information has been received

or

(iii) a reasonable suspicion exists

of his having been so concerned.

Page 9 of 13

Therefore, for a peace officer to be authorized by law to arrest a person (suspect)

for having committed a cognizable offence, one of the following should have

occurred

(i) the peace officer should have by himself formed an objective opinion that

the suspect has been concerned in the commission of a cognizable offence;

(ii) the peace officer should have either directly received a complaint or must be

aware that a complaint has been made against the suspect, and he should

have formed the objective opinion that such complaint against the suspect

(that he has been concerned in committing a cognizable offence) is

reasonable;

(iii) the peace officer should have either directly received information or should

be aware that information has been received against the suspect, and he

should have formed the objective opinion that such information is credible

and gives rise to the allegation that the suspect has been concerned in the

commission of a cognizable office (sic); or

(iv) the peace officer should have developed reasonable suspicion that the

suspect has been concerned in the commission of a cognizable offence.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents have failed to file objections although they were represented.

Hence the version of the Petitioners against them has to be considered in the absence of

any denial by them.

During his testimony in Galagedera Magistrates Court Case No. 9068/23, the 1st

Respondent admitted having arrested the 1st Petitioner. According to him, the arrest was

made subsequent to a complaint made by one Ajmeer Mohomed Fathima Farzana who

named the 1st Petitioner as the suspect for the theft of certain jewellery belonging to her.

According to the 1st Respondent, this complaint was made at 16.30 on 08.08.2022.

Page 10 of 13

The parties are at variance as to the date on which the arrest was made. According to 1st

Respondent, the arrest took place on 08.08.2022 subsequent to the complaint made on

that day.

However, the 1st Petitioner claims that he was arrested on 07.08.2022 and produced

before the Magistrate only on 09.08.2022. The complainant in her testimony before the

Magistrate stated that the incident took place on 04.08.2022 and that after complaining

of this to the Police, she was asked to come on 05.08.2022 to record the complaint. In

view of this evidence, I conclude that the arrest of the 1st Petitioner took place on

07.08.2022 as claimed by the Petitioner.

The complaint of Ajmeer Mohomed Fathima Farzana had been recorded by the Police only

on 08.08.2022. The 1st Petitioner was arrested on 07.08.2022. Assuming that she had

made a verbal complaint to the Police on 04.08.2022 as claimed by her during the

Magistrate Court proceedings, that by itself does not, in the circumstances of this matter,

provide a reasonable basis to have arrested the 1st Petitioner.

Moreover, according to the notes of the 1st Respondent, the 1st Petitioner was arrested

because he was behaving suspiciously. However, by that time, the house of the 1st

Petitioner had not been even subjected to a search. To make matters worse, the 1st

Respondent had stated under cross examination before the Magistrate that the 1st

Petitioner was arrested for questioning and investigations.

In Piyasiri & Others v. Nimal Fernando, A.S.P. & Others [(1988) 1 Sri LR 173 at 184] it was

held that:

No Police Officer has the right to arrest a person on a vague and general

suspicion, not knowing the precise crime suspected but hoping to obtain evidence

of the commission of some crime for which they have the power to arrest. Even if

such evidence comes to light the arrest will be illegal because there will have been

Page 11 of 13

no proper communication of the reason for the: arrest to the accused at the time

of the arrest. (emphasis added)

In Premlal De Silva v. Inspector Rodrigo and Others [(1991) 2 Sri LR 307 at 321]

Kulatunga, J. warned that if the police continue with the practice of taking into custody

suspects on speculation or merely on the ground that they are persons of bad repute, in

the hope of getting a break in the investigations by interrogating them, it would end up in

the use of third-degree methods.

In this case, this is what precisely happened. A minor was taken into custody without a

reasonable suspicion and tortured with a view to extracting a confession.

I hold that the 1st Respondent infringed the fundamental rights of the 1st Petitioner

guaranteed by Article 13(1) of the Constitution.

Article 13(2)

Article 13(2) directs that every person held in custody shall be brought before the

Magistrate according to the procedure established by law. This is a safeguard aimed at

protecting the personal liberty of such person.

In Channa Pieris [supra. at 76] Amerasinghe, J. held that in general, the purpose of Article

13(2) is to enable a person arrested without a warrant by a non-judicial authority to make

representations to a judge who may apply his "judicial mind" to the circumstances before

him and make a neutral determination on what course of action is appropriate in relation

to his detention and further custody, detention or deprivation of personal liberty.

I have concluded that the 1st Petitioner was arrested on 07.08.2022 at about 5.00 p.m. He

was produced before the Magistrate only on 09.08.2022 at around 8.30 a.m.

Page 12 of 13

Accordingly, I hold that the 1st Petitioner was not produced before the learned Magistrate

within the time frame envisaged by Sections 36 and 37 of the Code. I hold that the 1st

Respondent has infringed the fundamental rights of the 1st Petitioner guaranteed by

Article 13(2) of the Constitution.

Article 12(1)

This guarantees the equal protection of the law. I have concluded that the 1st Respondent

has infringed the fundamental rights of the 1st Petitioner guaranteed by Articles 11, 13(1)

and 13(2) of the Constitution. Ipso facto, the 1st Respondent has infringed the

fundamental right of the 1st Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1).

What remains is to determine the compensation payable to the 1st and 2nd Petitioners.

There are aggravating circumstances in this case which must be considered by this Court.

According to the birth certificate of the 1st Petitioner (P1), he was 16 years (minor) at the

material time. He had revealed this in his statement made to the Police. Yet the Police

detained the 1st Petitioner in a cell along with another adult who was not a relative.

Section 13 of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance prevents a child or young person

from associating with an adult (not being a relative) who is charged with any offence while

detained in a police station. In Landage Ishara Anjali (Minor) and Another v. Waruni

Bogahawatte and Others [S.C.F.R. No. 677/2012, S.C.M. 12.06.2019] Aluwihare P.C., J. in

setting out guidelines pertaining to the detention of suspects held that children shall be

detained separately from adult detainees.

While all forms of torture on any person must be condemned in the strongest terms, in

this case the 1st Petitioner had to undergo the agony of nai miris extract being poured into

his eyes. He was 16 years of age at that time having just completed the G.C.E. Ordinary

Level Examiantion. The fear of loss of eyesight must definitely have tortured his mind.

Page 13 of 13

Upon a consideration of all the foregoing reasons, I declare that:

(1) The 1st Respondent has infringed the fundamental rights of the 1st Petitioner

guaranteed by Articles 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution.

(2) The 1st Respondent has infringed the fundamental rights of the 2nd Petitioner

guaranteed by Article 11 of the Constitution.

The 1st Respondent shall pay a sum of Rs. 3,00,000/= as compensation from his personal

funds to the 1st Petitioner.

The 1st Respondent shall pay a sum of Rs. 75,000/= as compensation from his personal

funds to the 2nd Petitioner.

In the exercise of the just and equitable jurisdiction of this Court, I further direct the 4th

Respondent, the Inspector General of Police to issue a direction to all Police Officers

directing that when a minor is arrested, the mother or father (or in their absence a close

relative) of the minor be granted access to the minor before he is produced before the

Magistrate and in any event, within 6 hours of the arrest.

Application allowed.
