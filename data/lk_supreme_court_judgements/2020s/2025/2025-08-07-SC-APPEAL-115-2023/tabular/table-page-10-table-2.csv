"Tribunal can pass on to the next stage of making an order that is fair and equitable"
"having regard to the facts so found.‚Äù [emphasis added]."
"It is therefore clear that while Sec(cid:415)on 31C(1) has circumscribed the role of a Labour"
"Tribunal, it has drawn a nexus that the Tribunal must maintain between the material"
"that is placed before it and the just and equitable award that it would eventually"
"make. It is also clear that in the guise of making a just and equitable order, the Labour"
"Tribunal  cannot  discriminate  between  the  par(cid:415)es.  It  must  consider  the  cases  put"
"forward by both par(cid:415)es in a balanced manner, and its decision must be supported"
"by evidence. It is only then that the order of a Labour Tribunal would be truly just"
"and equitable."
