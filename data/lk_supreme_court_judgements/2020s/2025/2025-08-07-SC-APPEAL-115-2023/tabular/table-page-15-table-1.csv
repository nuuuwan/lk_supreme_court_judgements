"32)","In my view, there were several items of evidence that ought to have been considered"
"","by the High Court in determining the principal issue of whether the services of the"
"","Applicant had been terminated by the Employer  or whether the Applicant le(cid:332) his"
"","employment voluntarily."
"3
3)","The ﬁrst is the fact that the Applicant reported to the Head Oﬃce immediately upon"
"","being asked to do so, without raising any objec(cid:415)on, and con(cid:415)nued to do so."
"34)","The second item of evidence is the correspondence between the Applicant and Lee"
"","where Lee informed the Applicant on 3rd August 2018 that “you can only resign” and"
"","“we have no other suitable work for you, so you only have to resign and leave”. True"
"","enough, the services of the Applicant have not been terminated by these messages"
"","but the said messages provide an insight into the mind of the Employer, and gives"
"","context to what the Applicant claims he was told by Irene the next day."
"3
5)","The third item of evidence is the failure on the part of the Employer to assign du(cid:415)es"
"","to  the  Applicant,  even  though the  Applicant  reported  for  work  on  the 3rd and 4th"
"","August 2018, and in spite of the Applicant having speciﬁcally requested by an email"
"","sent on the 4th that he be assigned du(cid:415)es. I do understand that the Employer may"
"","have been irritated by the fact that the Applicant did not report for duty without any"
"","prior in(cid:415)ma(cid:415)on on the 2nd, and reported late on the 3rd, but the fact remains that"
"","the Applicant was a resident of Medirigiriya and that having reported to the Head"
"","Oﬃce immediately upon being asked to do  so, the  Applicant needed  (cid:415)me to ﬁnd"
"","accommoda(cid:415)on within Colombo."
"3
6)","The 
fourth  and  perhaps  the  most 
important 
item  of  evidence 
is  that  when"
"","considering the posi(cid:415)on of the Applicant, one must bear in mind that, (a) it was Irene"
"","who communicated the decision of the Employer that the Applicant must report to"
"","the Head Oﬃce on 31st July 2018 [A2], (b) the response of the Applicant was sent to"
"","Irene [A2a], and (c) the Applicant sought a list of du(cid:415)es also from Irene [A4b]. Thus,"
"","the decisions of the Employer were communicated to the Applicant by Irene, and"
"","thus, the decision of the Labour Tribunal to accept the evidence of the Applicant on"
"","this issue cannot be faulted. In any event, it was open for the Employer to have led"
"","the  evidence  of  Irene,  if  what  the  Applicant  was  sta(cid:415)ng  was  not  true,  which  the"
"","Employer did not do."
