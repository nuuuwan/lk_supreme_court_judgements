"I am in agreement with the Labour Tribunal that the evidence in this case supports"
"the conclusion that what was conveyed to the Applicant by  Irene was the decision"
"of the Employer and that the services of the Applicant had been terminated by the"
"Employer  without any  valid  reason. The conveyance  of  the  said  decision  by  Irene"
"cannot  be  considered  in  isola(cid:415)on  of  the  other  evidence  to  which  I  have  already"
"referred to. Whether such a message was conveyed is a ques(cid:415)on of fact supported"
"by evidence and hence, the said conclusion cannot be described as being perverse."
"In the light of the above material, I am of the view that the High Court erred when it"
"arrived at the conclusion that the Applicant had not been told by Irene not to report"
"for work."
