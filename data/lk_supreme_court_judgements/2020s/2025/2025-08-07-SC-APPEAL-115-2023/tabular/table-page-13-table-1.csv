"In Kotagala Planta(cid:415)ons Ltd. and Lankem Tea and Rubber Planta(cid:415)ons (Pvt) Ltd. v"
"Ceylon Planters Society [supra; at page 303], Chief Jus(cid:415)ce J.A.N De Silva held that:"
"“An appeal lies from an order of a Labour Tribunal only on [a] ques(cid:415)on of law. A"
"ﬁnding on facts by the Labour Tribunal is not disturbed in appeal by an Appellate"
"Court  unless  the  decision  reached  by  the  Tribunal  can  be  considered  to  be"
"perverse. It has been well established that for an order to be perverse the ﬁnding"
"must  be  inconsistent  with  the  evidence  led  or  that  the  ﬁnding  could  not  be"
"supported by the evidence led (vide Caledonian Estates Ltd. v. Hillman 79 (1) NLR"
"421)” [emphasis added]."
