"","termina(cid:415)on are essen(cid:415)ally ques(cid:415)ons of fact that must be determined by the Labour"
"","Tribunal. Unless the decision of the Labour Tribunal is perverse or its ﬁndings are not"
"","supported by the evidence, the decision of the Labour Tribunal on factual ma(cid:425)ers is"
"","not a ma(cid:425)er that the High Court must interfere with."
"2","9) 
The Labour Tribunal, having speciﬁcally considered the posi(cid:415)on of the Employer that"
"","Irene  did  not  tell  the  Applicant  not  to  report  for  work,  arrived  at  the  following"
"","conclusion:"

"3","0) 
Thus, the High Court was clearly in error when it held that the Labour Tribunal has"
"","not given its mind to this issue."
"3","1) 
In any event, the High Court only considered the evidence of the Applicant that he"
"","was told by Irene not to report for work any further in coming to its conclusion that"
"","the  Applicant  voluntarily  abandoned  his  employment.  Quite  apart  from  the  said"
"","ﬁnding of the High Court not being supported by the evidence, I am of the view that"
"","the High Court ought to have taken a holis(cid:415)c approach to the evidence in deciding"
"","whether the Labour Tribunal was correct in its conclusion."
