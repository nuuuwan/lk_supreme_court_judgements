"Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  Order  of  the  High  Court,  the  Defendants  instituted  these"
"proceedings seeking to get both the Orders of the High Court and District Court set aside."
"This Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following questions set out in Paragraphs (a),"
"(b) and (f) of the Petition dated 21.11.2018:"
"(a) Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law by misapplying Section 93(2) of the"
"Civil Procedure Code?"
"(b) Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law and/ or in fact by failing to consider"
"that the Respondent has not pleaded and/ or submitted any ground which could satisfy"
"that  the  refusal  of  the  proposed  amendment  would  cause  a  ‘grave  and  irremediable"
"injustice’ to the Respondent?"
"(f) Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law in concluding that the Respondent is"
"not guilty of laches?"
"The Defendants argue that the District Court Order dated 11.07.2018 is contrary to the"
"provisions of Section 93(2) of the CPC and relevant judicial precedents.  The contention"
"of the Defendants is that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that rejecting the amendment"
"would cause grave and irremediable injustice and that it provides no justification for the"
"significant delay in seeking to amend the Plaint. The Defendants assert that the Plaintiff is"
"guilty  of  laches,  as  the  facts  relating  to  the  proposed  amendments  were  known  to  the"
"Plaintiff  when  the  action  was  filed  and  do  not  relate  to  any  new  events  or  facts  that"
"emerged later."
"The  Defendant  brings  to  the  attention  of  this  Court  that  the  High  Court  has  correctly"
"identified that the application to amend the Plaint falls within the scope of Section 93(2)"
"of the CPC and has correctly acknowledged that laches could prevent the Plaintiff from"
"amending the Plaint. Anyhow, the learned Judge of the High Court concluded there was"
"no  laches.  The  Defendants  complain  that  although  the  High  Court  correctly  applied"
"Section  93(2)  of  the  CPC  and  acknowledged  the  relevance  of  laches,  its  final  decision"
"contradicts the District Court’s factual finding that the Plaintiff was guilty of laches. The"
"Defendant contends that the District Court, despite such findings, has erroneously allowed"
"the amendment on a flawed basis."
