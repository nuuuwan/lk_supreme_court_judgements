"irremediable injustice and the absence of laches, remain consistent in both the old and new"
"provisions. The said Section 93 (before the amendment in 2017) reads:"
"“93(1) Upon application made to it before the day first fixed for trial of the action,"
"in  the  presence  of,  or  after  reasonable  notice  to  all  the  parties  to  the  action,  the"
"Court shall have full power of amending in its discretion, all pleadings in the action,"
"by way of addition, or alteration, or of omission."
"(2)  On  or  after  the  day  first  fixed  for  the  trial  of  the  action  and  before  final"
"judgement, no application for the amendment of any pleadings shall be allowed"
"unless the Court is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded by the Court, that grave and"
"irremediable injustice will be caused if such amendment is not permitted, and on"
"no other ground, and that the party so applying has not been guilty of laches."
"(3)  Any  application  for  amendment  of  pleadings  which  may  be  allowed  by  the"
"Court  under  subsection  (1)  or  (2)  shall  be  upon  such  terms  as  to  costs  and"
"postponement or otherwise as the Court may think fit."
"(4) The additions or alterations or omissions shall be clearly made on the face of"
"the pleading affected by the order;  or if this cannot conveniently be  done, a fair"
"copy of the pleading as altered shall, be appended in the record of the action to the"
"pleading amended. Every such addition or alteration or omission shall be signed"
"by the Judge.”"
