"recognizing  that  litigants  must  be  afforded  a  fair  hearing,  noted  that  the  Court  cannot"
"afford an unlimited hearing and stated as follows:"
"“Whether  in  superior  Courts  or  original  Courts,  there  is  no  doubt  that  litigants  must  be"
"afforded a fair hearing, but the Court cannot afford, in my view, an unlimited hearing. We"
"must understand that the demands and exigencies of contemporary justice are fundamentally"
"different from those that prevailed decades ago. Litigants are not entitled to unfettered use of"
"judicial time, as other litigants await their turn. This shift reflects the current trend across all"
"major jurisdictions, which I will discuss further under the subheading ‘Global Trends’”."
