"have made the application for amendment of pleadings before the date the case was first fixed"
"for the pre-trial, not on the date the case was taken up for pre-trial”."
"Accordingly, 
the  said  case  of  Rajapaksha  Appuhamilage  Lionel  Ranjith  clarifies 
the"
"application of Section 93 of the CPC as amended by Acts No. 9 of 1991, No. 8 of 2017,"
"and No. 29 of 2023. The court emphasized that amendments to pleadings after the first"
"pre-trial  conference  are  strictly 
limited  to  prevent  grave  and 
irremediable 
injustice,"
"provided the applicant has not been guilty of laches. Mere delay does not constitute laches;"
"the delay must be unreasonable and unjustifiable in context. The earlier liberal approach"
"to  allowing  amendments  at  any  stage  is  no  longer  valid,  reflecting  modern  judicial"
"demands for efficiency and fairness. The application of the defendants in the said case, to"
"amend their joint answer was rejected, as the alleged conflict of interest was foreseeable,"
"and the application was untimely, made on the pre-trial date. Thus, I hold the view that"
"the  latest  jurisprudence  laid  down  in  the  said  judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  on  the"
"discretion vested under the said Section 93 should be adopted in resolving the questions of"
"the instant case."
"It is observed that the Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the stringent requirements outlined in"
"Section 93(2) of the CPC for amending pleadings after the initial trial date. Specifically,"
"under Section 93(2), the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence or reasoning for the"
"District  Court  to  be  satisfied  that  denying  the  amendment  would  result  in  grave  and"
"irremediable injustice, nor has the Court recorded such reasons to justify the amendment."
"Furthermore, as required by Section 93(2), the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that such a"
"grave injustice would occur if the amendment is not permitted, and no other valid grounds"
"have  been  presented  to  support  his  application.  Additionally,  the  Plaintiff  is  guilty  of"
"laches,  having  delayed  the  filing  of  the  first  Amended  Plaint  until  25.07.2017,  and  the"
"second  Amended  Plaint  until  14.09.2017,  despite  the  original  Plaint  being  filed  on"
"05.05.2016.  The  Plaintiff  has  offered  no 
reasonable/sufficient  explanation 
for 
this"
"inordinate  delay,  and  the  proposed  amendments  pertain  to  facts  that  were  within  the"
"Plaintiff’s knowledge at the time the action was instituted, further indicating laches."
"On  careful  consideration  of  the  circumstances  of  the  whole  matter,  I  hold  that  the"
"Plaintiff’s application for the amendment of his Plaint fails to meet the mandatory criteria"
"outlined in Section 93(2) of the CPC, rendering the requested amendments impermissible."
"I take the view that this is not a fit and proper case for the trial judge to use his discretion"
