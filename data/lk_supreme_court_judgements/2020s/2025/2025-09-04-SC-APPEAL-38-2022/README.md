Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Plaintiff- Respondent- Respondent (Plaintiff) filed an action against the Defendants-

Petitioners- Appellants (Defendants) by way of a Plaint dated 05.05.2016 seeking a

declaration stating that the Defendants have violated the oral and written agreements

entered into in September 2014, between the Plaintiff and the Defendants. Additionally,

the Plaintiff sought a decree to be entered against the Defendants in a sum of

Rs.10,600,000/-. The Defendants filed separate Answers on 18.01.2017, raising multiple

preliminary objections specifically on Sections 14, 15, 36(1), 40(d), 43, 46(2), and 50 of the

Civil Procedure Code (CPC). In their Answers, the Defendants not only prayed for the

dismissal of the case but also sought an order from the Court to reject or return the Plaint.

The first date of trial fixed by the Court was 26.04.2017, but it was again postponed

without taking up for trial. The Plaintiff filed his list of witnesses and documents on

07.04.2017, whereas the Defendants filed their list of witnesses and documents on

09.04.2017. Meanwhile, a motion was filed by the Plaintiff on 18.07.2017 seeking

permission to amend the Plaint. The matter was once again postponed on the second

scheduled date of trial, i.e. 25.07.2017, when the Amended Plaint was filed, subject to the

objections of the Defendants. Once again, the Plaintiff filed a second Amended Draft of

the Plaint on 14.09.2017. After considering the Defendants' objections, the District Court

issued an Order on 11.07.2018 accepting the Amended Plaint dated 14.09.2017.

The Defendants filed a Leave to Appeal Application in the Provincial High Court,

exercising civil jurisdiction holden in Colombo (High Court), challenging the said Order

dated 11.07.2018 of the District Court. The learned Judge of the High Court observed that

under Section 93(2) of the CPC, laches is the sole factor to consider whether any injustice

is caused to the opposite party when an application for amendment of pleadings is made.

The learned High Court Judge found no evidence of laches and, on that basis, sanctioned

the amendment of the Plaintiffs Plaint through an Order issued on 11.10.2019.

Page 5 of 10

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the High Court, the Defendants instituted these

proceedings seeking to get both the Orders of the High Court and District Court set aside.

This Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following questions set out in Paragraphs (a),

(b) and (f) of the Petition dated 21.11.2018:

(a) Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law by misapplying Section 93(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code?

(b) Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law and/ or in fact by failing to consider

that the Respondent has not pleaded and/ or submitted any ground which could satisfy

that the refusal of the proposed amendment would cause a grave and irremediable

injustice to the Respondent?

(f) Has the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law in concluding that the Respondent is

not guilty of laches?

The Defendants argue that the District Court Order dated 11.07.2018 is contrary to the

provisions of Section 93(2) of the CPC and relevant judicial precedents. The contention

of the Defendants is that the Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that rejecting the amendment

would cause grave and irremediable injustice and that it provides no justification for the

significant delay in seeking to amend the Plaint. The Defendants assert that the Plaintiff is

guilty of laches, as the facts relating to the proposed amendments were known to the

Plaintiff when the action was filed and do not relate to any new events or facts that

emerged later.

The Defendant brings to the attention of this Court that the High Court has correctly

identified that the application to amend the Plaint falls within the scope of Section 93(2)

of the CPC and has correctly acknowledged that laches could prevent the Plaintiff from

amending the Plaint. Anyhow, the learned Judge of the High Court concluded there was

no laches. The Defendants complain that although the High Court correctly applied

Section 93(2) of the CPC and acknowledged the relevance of laches, its final decision

contradicts the District Courts factual finding that the Plaintiff was guilty of laches. The

Defendant contends that the District Court, despite such findings, has erroneously allowed

the amendment on a flawed basis.

Page 6 of 10

The stand taken by the Plaintiff is that the District Court must identify the cause of action

together with the real dispute between the parties, granting its authority to allow necessary

amendments even following the amendments to Section 93(2) of the CPC. The Plaintiff

contends that the Amended Plaint did not introduce a new cause of action but merely

elaborated on the original one. The Plaintiff asserts that although Section 93 of the CPC

was amended by Act No. 9 of 1991 with the introduction of Section 93(2) regarding the

amendment of pleadings, other relevant sections, namely Sections 18, 21, 146, 148, and

149 of the CPC, remain unchanged. Therefore, he contends that in addition to evaluating

amendments under Section 93, courts can also consider the implications of these sections

when a party applies to amend pleadings.

I must now explore the evolution of Section 93 of the CPC and its applicability. Section

93 was repealed and replaced by a new provision under the Civil Procedure Code

(Amendment) Act No. 9 of 1991. Subsequently, the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment)

Act No. 8 of 2017 replaced the words first fixed for trial in subsections (1) and (2) with

the words first fixed for Pre-Trial. Subsequently, the Civil Procedure Code

(Amendment) Act No. 29 of 2023 further amended subsections (1) and (2) by substituting

the words first fixed for Pre-Trial of the action with the words first fixed for Pre-Trial

conference of the action.

As noted earlier, the Plaintiff filed the original Plaint on 05.05.2016. The first Amended

Plaint was filed on 25.07.2017, followed by the second Amended Plaint on 14.09.2017.

On 01.06.2018, the District Court reserved its Order, concerning the Defendants

objections to the second Amended Plaint, until 11.07.2018. Consequently, it is necessary

to determine whether the provisions of Section 93, as amended by Act No. 8 of 2017, apply

to this case. The Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 08 of 2017 was certified on

07.06.2017. Section 17 of this Amendment Act, which addresses pending actions subject

to the Act, states as follows:

All actions and matters which have been filed in the District Court but in respect

of which no date has been fixed for trial shall also be subject to the provisions of as

on the date of coming into operation of this Act.

In light of the above chronology of events, I take the view that the questions concerning

the said Section 93 in the instant case should be resolved based on the provisions that

Page 7 of 10

existed immediately before the said Amendment Act No. 8 of 2017. However, such

amendments are not crucial to the Plaintiffs applications as the cardinal requirements for

seeking an amendment to pleadings, including the need to demonstrate grave and

irremediable injustice and the absence of laches, remain consistent in both the old and new

provisions. The said Section 93 (before the amendment in 2017) reads:

93(1) Upon application made to it before the day first fixed for trial of the action,

in the presence of, or after reasonable notice to all the parties to the action, the

Court shall have full power of amending in its discretion, all pleadings in the action,

by way of addition, or alteration, or of omission.

(2) On or after the day first fixed for the trial of the action and before final

judgement, no application for the amendment of any pleadings shall be allowed

unless the Court is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded by the Court, that grave and

irremediable injustice will be caused if such amendment is not permitted, and on

no other ground, and that the party so applying has not been guilty of laches.

(3) Any application for amendment of pleadings which may be allowed by the

Court under subsection (1) or (2) shall be upon such terms as to costs and

postponement or otherwise as the Court may think fit.

(4) The additions or alterations or omissions shall be clearly made on the face of

the pleading affected by the order; or if this cannot conveniently be done, a fair

copy of the pleading as altered shall, be appended in the record of the action to the

pleading amended. Every such addition or alteration or omission shall be signed

by the Judge.

The Supreme Court in Rajapaksha Appuhamilage Lionel Ranjith v. Suraweera Arachchige

Dona Leelawathi and Others (SC Appeal 100/2020 SC Minutes of 14.05.2025) extensively

considered the scope of Section 93 of the CPC, as amended, and effectively settled the law

regarding amendments to pleadings under the said section. His Lordship Justice Mahinda

Samayawardhena, in the said case took the view that the previously accepted view that

all amendments necessary for the proper ventilation of the dispute and the determination

of the real controversy between the parties should be permitted at any stage from the

commencement of trial to final judgment, so long as any resulting prejudice or injustice

Page 8 of 10

could be cured by costs, can no longer be regarded as good law. His Lordship, whilst

recognizing that litigants must be afforded a fair hearing, noted that the Court cannot

afford an unlimited hearing and stated as follows:

Whether in superior Courts or original Courts, there is no doubt that litigants must be

afforded a fair hearing, but the Court cannot afford, in my view, an unlimited hearing. We

must understand that the demands and exigencies of contemporary justice are fundamentally

different from those that prevailed decades ago. Litigants are not entitled to unfettered use of

judicial time, as other litigants await their turn. This shift reflects the current trend across all

major jurisdictions, which I will discuss further under the subheading Global Trends.

Under Section 93(2), on or after the day first fixed for pre-trial conference of the action

and before final judgment, no application for amendment of any pleadings shall be

allowed: (a) unless the Court is satisfied, (b) for reasons to be recorded by the Court, (c)

that grave and irremediable injustice will be caused if such amendment is not permitted,

(d) and on no other ground, (e) and that the party so applying has not been guilty of laches.

Dealing with the aspect of laches, the Supreme Court in the said case emphasized that

mere delay, however prolonged, does not per se amount to laches and in other words,

laches cannot be determined solely by reference to the length of time taken to make the

application. The Court further observed as follows: the relevant question is not how many

months or years have elapsed since the application ought to have been madefor instance,

in this case, how much time has passed since the case was first fixed for pre-trial conference

to move for an amendment of the answerbut whether the delay is unreasonable and

unjustifiable in the context of the particular case.

His Lordship Justice Samayawardhena in the said case unambiguously held that the law

is now settled and that the provisions of Section 93(2) of the CPC are intended to address

amendments to pleadings after the day first fixed for pre-trial conference of the action,

arising from unforeseen circumstances. His Lordship further states:

The purported conflict of interest and grave injustice were foreseeable at the time the 1st

and 2nd defendants chose to file a joint answer, joint admissions and issues, and a joint list

of witnesses and documents, at three separate occasions after deliberations. In any event, if

they had really intended to amend the joint answer and file separate answers, they ought to

Page 9 of 10

have made the application for amendment of pleadings before the date the case was first fixed

for the pre-trial, not on the date the case was taken up for pre-trial.

Accordingly, the said case of Rajapaksha Appuhamilage Lionel Ranjith clarifies the

application of Section 93 of the CPC as amended by Acts No. 9 of 1991, No. 8 of 2017,

and No. 29 of 2023. The court emphasized that amendments to pleadings after the first

pre-trial conference are strictly limited to prevent grave and irremediable injustice,

provided the applicant has not been guilty of laches. Mere delay does not constitute laches;

the delay must be unreasonable and unjustifiable in context. The earlier liberal approach

to allowing amendments at any stage is no longer valid, reflecting modern judicial

demands for efficiency and fairness. The application of the defendants in the said case, to

amend their joint answer was rejected, as the alleged conflict of interest was foreseeable,

and the application was untimely, made on the pre-trial date. Thus, I hold the view that

the latest jurisprudence laid down in the said judgment of the Supreme Court on the

discretion vested under the said Section 93 should be adopted in resolving the questions of

the instant case.

It is observed that the Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the stringent requirements outlined in

Section 93(2) of the CPC for amending pleadings after the initial trial date. Specifically,

under Section 93(2), the Plaintiff has not provided sufficient evidence or reasoning for the

District Court to be satisfied that denying the amendment would result in grave and

irremediable injustice, nor has the Court recorded such reasons to justify the amendment.

Furthermore, as required by Section 93(2), the Plaintiff has not demonstrated that such a

grave injustice would occur if the amendment is not permitted, and no other valid grounds

have been presented to support his application. Additionally, the Plaintiff is guilty of

laches, having delayed the filing of the first Amended Plaint until 25.07.2017, and the

second Amended Plaint until 14.09.2017, despite the original Plaint being filed on

05.05.2016. The Plaintiff has offered no reasonable/sufficient explanation for this

inordinate delay, and the proposed amendments pertain to facts that were within the

Plaintiffs knowledge at the time the action was instituted, further indicating laches.

On careful consideration of the circumstances of the whole matter, I hold that the

Plaintiffs application for the amendment of his Plaint fails to meet the mandatory criteria

outlined in Section 93(2) of the CPC, rendering the requested amendments impermissible.

I take the view that this is not a fit and proper case for the trial judge to use his discretion

Page 10 of 10

under Section 93 to allow the application for amendments to the Plaint or to employ the

concepts of fairness. Taking into account the entirety of the circumstances, I answer the

questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted in the affirmative. The Judgements

of the High Court (dated 11.10.2019) and the District Court (dated 11.07.2018) are hereby

set aside, and the instant Appeal is allowed without costs.
