Dr. Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

This Court granted Leave to Appeal on 06.05.2010 from the Judgement of the Provincial

High Court of the Southern Province holden in Matara (‘High Court’) dated 17.12.2009. At

that stage, no specific question of law had been identified by this Court, beyond the general

questions described in the Petition that need to be addressed in the instant Application.

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (‘Plaintiff’) instituted a Partition Action against the

Defendants-Respondents-Respondents (‘Defendants’), including the 4th Defendant-

Respondent-Appellant (‘4th Defendant’), seeking a declaration that he is entitled to an

undivided portion (146.33 Perches) of the subject land and also to get the said land partitioned

among the parties. The District Court decided that the Plaintiff is not entitled to the title as

described in the Plaint, and the subject property belongs to the 4th Defendant. However, in the

High Court, the Appeal lodged by the Plaintiff was allowed, and he was granted the relief as

prayed for in the prayer of the Plaint.

The 4th Defendant asserts that the land in question has long been held in possession as property

belonging to the Polommaruwa Raja Maha Viharaya in Tangalle, spanning many centuries. The

Chief Incumbent of the said Viharaya has given the property to the Plaintiff’s father,

Sawundias Wanigasingha, for cultivation under the Planting Agreement ‘4V1’ (Deed No. 561

dated 26.11.1939). He states that the buildings on Lot No. 3 were constructed by the 2nd and

3rd Defendants respectively, with the leave and license of the 4th Defendant Thera. The 2nd and

3rd Defendants were supposed to possess the land after constructing their residences with the

permission of the said 4th Defendant.

Page 7 of 12

Nevertheless, the Plaintiff maintains that his mother, Leelawathie, obtained prescriptive

ownership over the property in dispute. Citing the Plaintiff's cross-examination, the 4th

Defendant highlights that the Plaintiff's mother secured her claim through cultivation, though

the Plaintiff admitted ignorance regarding how she (Leelawathie) initially gained access to

the land for planting. Drawing on the available evidence, the 4th Defendant underscores that

Leelawathie never acquired the land, via purchase from any party. Furthermore, the 4th

Defendant argues that during cross-examination, the Plaintiff acknowledged his mother's

possession of the property commencing in 1939, the same year the Planting Agreement ‘4V1’

was executed. Notably, the said Planting Agreement appoints the Plaintiff's father, Sawundias

Wanigasingha, as the individual responsible for the planting.

The 4th Defendant highlights the multiple contradictions on the part of the evidence in the

Plaintiff's testimony. It is contended that the position taken up by the Plaintiff in his pleadings

was contradicted during cross-examination, when the Plaintiff acknowledged the disputed

property as State Land. Upon being questioned, during cross-examination as to why his father

entered into the Planting Agreement given his mother’s alleged ownership, the Plaintiff

offered no reply and refrained from disputing the validity of the aforesaid Planting Agreement.

The 4th Defendant, drawing attention of this Court to the Plaintiff's testimony, contends that

at the outset of the District Court Trial, the Plaintiff asserted prescriptive title for both himself

and his predecessor over the disputed property. Yet, during cross-examination he shifted his

stance, claiming instead that his mother obtained the title through an informal deed in

exchange for valuable consideration.

The 4th Defendant further contends that the Plaintiff thereafter adopted an entirely different

position that the subject matter is State Land. Thus, the 4th Respondent asserts that the

Plaintiff is precluded from prevailing on his claim for a declaration of prescriptive title, given

these successive and inconsistent assertions regarding his alleged ownership. The learned

High Court Judge proceeded on the premise that the Plaintiff had indeed acquired title by

prescription, whereas the learned District Judge rejected the Plaintiff's credibility owing to

several inconsistencies in his evidence.

Page 8 of 12

The 4th Defendant places comparable emphasis on the absence of any documentary proof

submitted to the District Court to validate the Plaintiff's alleged prescriptive title, apart from

his Deed No. 1016 (marked 'P1'). Nonetheless, the 4th Defendant maintains that this Deed

‘P1’ fails to bolster the Plaintiff's prescriptive claim, since Leelawathie, as the wife, and the

Plaintiff, as the son of Sawundias Wanigasingha (Planter), are constrained as his heirs,

executors, and administrators by the terms of the said Planting Agreement marked as ‘4V1’.

Additionally, the 4th Defendant submits that in terms of Section 34 of the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance, a claim of prescription cannot be maintained in respect of temple

property/sangika property. He relies on the Judgement of Waharaka alias Moratota Sobitha

Thero v Amunugama Ratnapala Thero [1981] 1 Sri LR 201, at 224, in which the Supreme Court

held that:

"When a Viharadhipathi sues to be declared entitled to the office of Viharadhipathi of a temple

and to eject those disputing his rights or to recover possession of the temple and its endowments

he is enforcing a right he has in law and any such claim is exempt from the provisions of the

Prescription Ordinance by virtue of the Provisions of S. 34 Cap. 318. [Buddhist Temporalities

Ordinance 1931]. Therefore, all cases that have held that such an action is bound by the

provisions of either Section 3 or Section 10 of the Prescription Ordinance have been wrongly

decided ‘and should no longer be considered good law” (emphasis added)

Meanwhile, the Plaintiff maintains that his mother, Leelawathie, independently held

possession of the property for 50 years, securing prescriptive ownership in the process, before

conveying the land to him; he in turn, transferred an undivided share of 20 perches to the 1st

Defendant. The Plaintiff argues that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants failed to present any credible

evidence to dispute the Plaintiff’s prescriptive title. He insists that his acquisition of the land

stems from Deed No. 1016 (marked ‘P1’), a document undisputed by the 2nd to 4th Defendants.

On this basis, the Plaintiff asserts that he has duly established the pedigree outlined in the

Plaint, as well as his rightful title to the disputed property.

The stand taken by the Plaintiff in respect of the ‘4V1’ is that the said Planting Agreement

was never registered at the Land Registry. He further argues that the land described in the

schedule to that Agreement differs clearly from the property in dispute, as the boundaries and

Page 9 of 12

the extent reflected in the Plaint bear no resemblance to those in ‘4V1’. Additionally, the

Plaintiff contends that the Defendants did not comply with Section 18(3) of the Partition Act,

having omitted to secure a commission for verifying their claim, since the land apparently

subject to partition is distinct from the actual contested property.

Another facet of the arguments raised on behalf of the Plaintiff hinges on the Defendants'

purported inability to furnish reliable proof that the property constitutes sangika property. In

particular, he maintains that the documents tendered by the 4th Defendant, marked as ‘4V2'

to '4V7,' were intended to demonstrate the character of the land as sangika property but are

inadequate as they furnish no clear identification of the relevant parcel of land by omitting to

delineate exact boundaries. It is observed that the 3rd Defendant is the husband of the

Plaintiff's sister, and he testified that the disputed property may qualify as sangika property.

The plaintiff does not hold possession of the land in question, whereas the 2nd and 3rd

Defendants do. The 2nd Defendant is reportedly the son of the Plaintiff's sister. In his

examination in chief, the 2nd Defendant rejected the assertion that Leelawathie was the

original owner of the land, maintaining instead that it belongs to the Temple. After the

Plaintiff's evidence, the retired ‘Gramasevaka’ was summoned as a witness, and during his

cross-examination, he clearly conceded he was unaware of the ownership of the land in

dispute.

Review of the said Planting Agreement reveals that three boundaries correspond with those

specified in Preliminary Plan No. 881101. The southern boundary alone fails to align;

nonetheless, the 4th Defendant counters this by suggesting that the surveyor likely overlooked

or omitted any reference to the land extending beyond the road shown in that Preliminary

Plan. It is therefore reasonable to infer that the Plaintiff's father, Sawundias Wanigasingha,

implicitly acknowledged the subject land's ownership by the Chief Incumbent Thera, given

his execution of the Planting Agreement ‘4V1’.

The learned District Judge took the view that, in a partition action, the title of the parties

needs to be examined thoroughly and the land to be partitioned should be identified correctly

prior to any partition. The District Court decided that the Plaintiff does not own the total

extent described in the plan marked ‘P1’. Drawing from the Planting Agreement ‘4V1’, the

Page 10 of 12

Trial Judge noted that said ‘4V1’ is very much older than the Deed marked ‘P1’, rendering it

untenable to presume that the Plaintiff has been in possession of the subject land for a long

period. The District Court further observed that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants were made parties

in its’ proceedings because they hold possession of the property. Moreover, the Trial Judge

opined that the action could not be dismissed solely for want of evidence regarding the

registration of Deed No. ‘4V1’ at the land registry. The learned District Judge has concluded

that the Plaintiff failed to prove his case on a balance of probabilities.

The learned High Court Judge, referring to the schedule of the answer of the 4th Defendant,

took the view that the boundaries therein are distinct from the boundaries mentioned in the

schedule of the Plaint. Further, she has observed that the extent mentioned in the Answer of

the 4th Defendant and the Plaintiff's Plaint are different. Additionally, the High Court has

drawn its attention to the fact that no steps were taken to issue a commission to the Surveyor

General. In summation, the learned High Court Judge decided that the Defendants had failed

to establish that the land claimed by the Plaintiff and the land subject to the Deed marked as

‘4V1’ are the same. As a result, the High Court granted the Plaintiff the reliefs prayed for in

the prayer of the Plaint.

At this stage, I need to draw my attention to the dicta in Gabriel Perera v. Agnes Perera 43

CLW 82 where Basnayake J. (in agreement with Gratiaen J.), held that:

“It is settled rule of interpretation of deeds that, where the portion conveyed is perfectly described,

and can be precisely ascertained, and no difficulty arises except from a subsequent inconsistent

statement as to its extent, the inconsistency as to extent should be treated as a mere falsa

demonstratio not affecting that which is already sufficiently conveyed. Llewellyn vs. Earl of Jersey

(1843) 11 M. and W. 183, 12 L. J. Ex 243.”

Therefore, I am satisfied, based on the evidence, that the land described in the said Planting

Agreement ‘4V1’ is not a completely different land from the land described in the Plaint. Upon

careful examination of the overall evidence led in the District Court, I am convinced that the

Plaintiff has failed to establish title to the subject property on a balance of probabilities. I arrive

at such a conclusion given the serious inconsistencies in his evidence and the binding effect

of the Planting Agreement marked '4V1' executed by his father acknowledging the Chief

Page 11 of 12

Incumbent Thera's ownership. The absence of credible evidence supporting a prescriptive title

over what is demonstrably sangika property is also another reason.

The learned District Judge's conclusions that the Plaintiff does not own the total extent

described in the plan marked ‘P1’ and that the action cannot succeed without thorough

examination of the parties' title and precise identification of the land for partition, are correct

and unassailable based on the circumstances of this case. Likewise, I am taking the view that

the evidence revolves around the execution of the said Planting Agreement ‘4V1’ in favour of

the father of the Plaintiff outweighs the ancillary evidence adduced on behalf of the Plaintiff

in establishing his alleged title. Hence, I am unable to agree with the conclusions of the

learned High Court Judge.

Having examined the evidence and the Judgements of the District Court as well as the High

Court, I consider it appropriate, based on the circumstances of this case, to answer the

following questions arising from the contents of paragraph 10 of the Petition dated

25.01.2010, in the affirmative;

1. Did the learned Judges of the High Court fail to give due consideration to the evidence

led and the documents filed in the Case?

2. Did the learned Judges of the High Court err in holding that the Defence had failed to

prove that the land in suit is a sangika property?

3. Did the learned Judges of the High Court fail to consider that the Plaintiff had not

denied that his predecessors entered the land in suit on the Agreement marked ‘4V1’?

4. Did the High Court err in holding that the Plaintiff had prescriptive title to the land in

suit?

5. Did the learned Judges of the High Court fail to consider that the document marked

‘4V1’, is only a Planting Agreement under which the Plaintiff's father had been allowed

to plant coconut trees on the said land and therefore no title to the land can be claimed

based on the said Agreement marked ‘4V1’?

In these circumstances, the Appeal from the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge is

allowed. Accordingly, the said Judgment of the High Court dated 17.12.2009 is set aside and

the Judgment of the learned District Judge dated 30.07.2004 is affirmed. I order no costs.
