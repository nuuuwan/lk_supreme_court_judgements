"Samayawardhena, J."
"T
he  plaintiff  instituted  this  action  in  the  District  Court  of  Panadura  on"
"06.10.1971, seeking to partition the land described in the schedule to the"
"plaint among himself and the four defendants (page 171 of the appeal brief"
"marked  X).  Subsequently,  several  parties  intervened  and  were  added  as"
"defendants. George Fransis De Silva, who appeared before the surveyor at"
"the preliminary survey as a claimant, was added as the 5th defendant. He"
"filed a statement of claim dated 11.09.1972, seeking undivided rights of the"
"land on paternal inheritance and long possession (page 177 of the brief)."
"According  to  this  statement  of  claim,  his  father  had  acquired  undivided"
"rights by Deed No. 10353, which was marked as 1V16 by the 1st defendant"
"through the evidence of the 5A defendant. Notably, in the said statement of"
"claim, the 5th defendant did not, in my view, affirmatively assert prescriptive"
"possession to the land. He did not disclose how or when he ceased to be a"
"co-owner of the land. In other words, he failed to point out how or when his"
"common possession transformed to adverse possession to the exclusion of"
"all  the  other  co-owners.  The  relevant  extract  from  his  statement  of  claim"
