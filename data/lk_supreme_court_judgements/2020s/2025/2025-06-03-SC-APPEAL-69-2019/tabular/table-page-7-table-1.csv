"and  the  particular  circumstances  of  the  case.  Bertram  C.J.  succinctly"
"articulated the principle at page 24 in the following terms:"
"It  is,  in  short,  a  question  of  fact,  wherever  long-continued  exclusive"
"possession by one co-owner is proved to have existed, whether it is not"
"just and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case that the parties"
"should  be  treated  as  though  it  had  been  proved  that  separate  and"
"exclusive possession had become adverse at some date more than ten"
"years before action brought."
