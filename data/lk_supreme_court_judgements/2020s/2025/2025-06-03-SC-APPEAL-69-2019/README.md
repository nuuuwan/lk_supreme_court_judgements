Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Panadura on

06.10.1971, seeking to partition the land described in the schedule to the

plaint among himself and the four defendants (page 171 of the appeal brief

marked X). Subsequently, several parties intervened and were added as

defendants. George Fransis De Silva, who appeared before the surveyor at

the preliminary survey as a claimant, was added as the 5th defendant. He

filed a statement of claim dated 11.09.1972, seeking undivided rights of the

land on paternal inheritance and long possession (page 177 of the brief).

According to this statement of claim, his father had acquired undivided

rights by Deed No. 10353, which was marked as 1V16 by the 1st defendant

through the evidence of the 5A defendant. Notably, in the said statement of

claim, the 5th defendant did not, in my view, affirmatively assert prescriptive

possession to the land. He did not disclose how or when he ceased to be a

co-owner of the land. In other words, he failed to point out how or when his

common possession transformed to adverse possession to the exclusion of

all the other co-owners. The relevant extract from his statement of claim

reads as follows:

5. 1955/8/18 වන දින අංක. 10353 දරණ ඔප්පුව පිට මෙෙ විත්තිකරුමේ පියාවූ එල්.

ඇන්තනී සිල්වා, ඔහුමේ උරුෙය මෙෙ විත්තිකරුට සහ ඔහුමේ සමහෝදරයාවූ ත ෝමස්

තෙනඩික ට පවරන ලදී.

6. අවුරුදු 75ක් පෙණ කාලයක සිට මෙෙ ඉඩමේ "බී" මකාටස සහ එහි ඇි වගාව සහ

මගාඩනැගිලි පැමිණිලිකරුට සහ අනිකුත්ත අයට විරුද්ධව බුක්ි විඳ ඇි බව මොහු කියා

සිටී.

Upon the death of the 5th defendant, his wife, Josephin Silva, was

substituted as the 5A defendant (page 74 of the brief). She initially filed a

new statement of claim dated 27.11.1981, seeking undivided rights to the

land (pages 189–191 of the brief). This position was reaffirmed in her further

SC/APPEAL/69/2019 6

amended statement of claim dated 17.09.1984, in which she again sought

undivided rights (pages 244–247 of the brief). However, in her amended

statement of claim dated 26.11.1990, she stated that she had acquired

prescriptive title to Lot B of the Preliminary Plan (pages 240–243 of the

brief). The Preliminary Plan appears at page 379 of the brief. It is evident

that the 5A defendant shifted her position over time in the course of the

proceedings. She appeared uncertain as to whether to claim undivided

rights or prescriptive title, but ultimately confined her claim to prescriptive

title. At the trial, 5A defendant raised three issues (issue Nos. 16-18) seeking

exclusion of Lot B from the corpus on the ground that she and her

predecessors have prescribed to that Lot (pages 506-507 of the brief).

At the trial, the 5A defendant gave evidence (pages 650–676) and marked

only one document, 5AV1, which is a receipt evidencing the payment of

rates to the Urban Council in respect of a “cadjan tenement and land”

identified as Assessment No. 16/5 and 16/6 over a period of time (pages

464–466 of the brief). That was the entirety of the evidence led on behalf of

the 5A defendant in support of her claim to prescriptive title to Lot B. In her

testimony, she spoke of long possession. However, it is trite law that, in

terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, long possession alone is

insufficient to establish a successful claim based on prescription. Moreover,

our courts have consistently held that, where a co-owner claims prescriptive

title, there must be clear and cogent evidence of an overt act marking the

commencement of adverse possession.

I am in entire agreement with the view expressed by the Full Bench of the

Supreme Court in Tillekeratne v. Bastian (1918) 21 NLR 12, wherein it was

held, in the context of prescription among co-owners, that a court may infer

that possession, though initially that of a co-owner, has subsequently

become adverse against other co-owners, depending on the lapse of time

SC/APPEAL/69/2019 7

and the particular circumstances of the case. Bertram C.J. succinctly

articulated the principle at page 24 in the following terms:

It is, in short, a question of fact, wherever long-continued exclusive

possession by one co-owner is proved to have existed, whether it is not

just and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case that the parties

should be treated as though it had been proved that separate and

exclusive possession had become adverse at some date more than ten

years before action brought.

Bertram C.J., at pages 20–21, addressed the artificiality of insisting upon

proof of an overt act where possession extends back as far as reasonable

memory reaches, in the following terms:

If it is found that one co-owner and his predecessors in interest have

been in possession of the whole property for a period as far back as

reasonable memory reaches; that he and they have done nothing to

recognize the claims of the other co-owners; that he and they have

taken the whole produce of the property for themselves; and that these

co-owners have never done anything to assert a claim to any share of

the produce, it is artificial in the highest degree to say that such a

person and his predecessors in interest must be presumed to be

possessing all this time in the capacity of co-owners, and that they can

never be regarded as having possessed adversely, simply because no

definite positive act can be pointed to as originating or demonstrating

the adverse possession. Where it is found that presumptions of law

lead to such an artificial result, it will generally be found that the law

itself provides a remedy for such a situation by means of counter-

presumptions. If such a thing were not possible, law would in many

cases become out of harmony with justice and good sense.

SC/APPEAL/69/2019 8

In the instant case, the position may have been different if the 5th defendant,

and later the 5A defendant, had consistently and firmly maintained the

position that they had prescribed to Lot B of the Preliminary Plan. However,

they shifted their position from time to time. When a party claims undivided

rights at one stage of the proceedings, it is incumbent upon him to explain

how and when prescriptive possession commenced against the other co-

owners. Prescriptive possession cannot commence after the institution of

the action, regardless of how long the litigation may have continued.

There was no cogent evidence led to demonstrate a clear separation of Lot

B, on the northern boundary, from the remainder of the land. Lot B is not

a small portion; it extends to 1 rood and 20.5 perches.

The learned District Judge, by judgment dated 28.08.2001, held that the

evidence led by the 5A defendant was insufficient to establish prescriptive

title to Lot B of the Preliminary Plan. The High Court, by its judgment dated

18.09.2013, affirmed the judgment of the District Court. I see no reason to

interfere with the judgment of the High Court.

The two questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted by this

Court, and the answers thereto, are as follows:

Q. Did the High Court err in law in concluding that the 5A defendant

and her predecessors did not possess Lot B in Plan X as a distinct

entity, notwithstanding the alleged admission by the 1st defendant of

the 5A defendant’s exclusive possession?

A. No. The 1st defendant did not admit to exclusive possession of Lot

B by the 5A defendant in a manner sufficient to establish prescriptive

title.

Q. Did the High Court fail to correctly apply the principles of

prescription in dismissing the appeal of the 5A defendant?

SC/APPEAL/69/2019 9

A. No.

Accordingly, the appeal of the 5A defendant is dismissed, but without costs.
