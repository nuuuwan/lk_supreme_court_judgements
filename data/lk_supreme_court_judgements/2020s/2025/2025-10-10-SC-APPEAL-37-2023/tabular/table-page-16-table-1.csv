"","","before the Tribunal was an employee who had ten years of unblemished service, but"
"","","who  stood  unfairly  accused  of  misinterpre(cid:415)ng  circulars  and  paying  employees  a"

"","","chose to ignore the said approval evidenced by the document E50 even though his"
"","","a(cid:425)en(cid:415)on was drawn to it. The second factor is that the Respondent did not lead any"
"","","evidence  to  establish  that 
the  reinstatement  of 
the  Applicant  would  not  be"
"","","expedient or appropriate in the circumstances of this case."
