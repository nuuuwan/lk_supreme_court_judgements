"4","6)","In my view, the High Court erred on three grounds when it failed to hold that the"
"","","decision of the Labour Tribunal not to reinstate the Applicant was wrong."
"4","7)","The  ﬁrst  was  when 
it  held  that  the  rela(cid:415)onship  between  the  par(cid:415)es  was  not"
"","","conducive to the reinstatement of the Applicant. This was not a ma(cid:425)er that had been"
"","","adverted to by the Labour Tribunal for the simple reason that there was no evidence"
"","","placed before the Tribunal in that regard."
"4","8)","The second ground on which the High Court erred is when it stated that since the"
"","","Applicant  is  54  years  of  age,  there  is  nothing  wrong  in  the  Labour  Tribunal  not"
"","","ordering reinstatement. Thus, the High Court failed to appreciate that (a) as long as"
"","","the Applicant was within the age of re(cid:415)rement at the (cid:415)me of the Order, there was"
"","","no legal impediment to the reinstatement of the Applicant, and (b) such remedy was"
"","","the most just and equitable order that the Labour Tribunal could have made in the"
"","","circumstances of this case."
"4","9)","The third ground is when it stated that the Applicant had sought compensa(cid:415)on in"
"","","lieu  of  reinstatement,  thus  demonstra(cid:415)ng  that  she  is  content  with  an  order  for"
"","","compensa(cid:415)on as opposed to reinstatement. The High Court failed to appreciate that"
"","","the said relief had been prayed for in the alterna(cid:415)ve, and that it is the responsibility"
"","","of  the  Labour  Tribunal  to  make  a  just  and  equitable  order  having  considered  the"
"","","evidence."
