While the ques\u019fons of law have been reproduced in paragraph 17 below, the primary issue that arises for determina\u019fon in this appeal is whether the High Court erred in law when it failed to order the reinstatement in service of the Applicant \u2013 Appellant \u2013 Appellant [the Applicant] in spite of the \ufb01nding of the Labour Tribunal, with which the High Court agreed, that the termina\u019fon of the services of the Applicant was unfair. Facts in brief 2) By le\u01a9er dated 30th September 2004, the Respondent \u2013 Respondent \u2013 Respondent [the Respondent] had appointed the Applicant to the post of Accountant with e\ufb00ect from 1st October 2004 [V1]. Her services had been con\ufb01rmed on 1st October 2007 by le\u01a9er dated 25th September 2007 [V2]. Pursuant to approval being granted by the Department of Management Services for the cadre posi\u019fons of the Respondent, the Applicant had been issued with a fresh le\u01a9er of appointment to the same post of Accountant with e\ufb00ect from 1st January 2009 [V3]. 3) Pursuant to an anonymous complaint followed by the \ufb01ndings of a preliminary inves\u019fga\u019fon, the Applicant had been placed on compulsory leave on 12th December 2013 with half pay. It is admi\u01a9ed that the Applicant had an unblemished record of service un\u019fl then. The Applicant had been interdicted on 29th May 2014 and had been issued with a charge sheet containing the following thirteen charges:",

Applica\u019fon to the Labour Tribunal and the appeal to the High Court 7) Aggrieved, the Applicant \ufb01led an applica\u019fon before the Labour Tribunal, Anuradhapura. The Respondent led the evidence of the Inves\u019fga\u019fon O\ufb03cer, the Inquiry O\ufb03cer and two others, and the Applicant gave evidence on her behalf. 8) The \ufb01nding of the Labour Tribunal that the termina\u019fon of the services of the Applicant is unfair and unjus\u019f\ufb01ed has been a\ufb03rmed by the High Court and is no longer in issue. However, in order to place in context my decision, I shall brie\ufb02y refer to the principal accusa\u019fon against the Applicant contained in the aforemen\u019foned \ufb01rst three charges, that being the failure on the part of the Applicant to act in terms of Circulars issued by the Department of Management Services in calcula\u019fng the salaries of employees of the Respondent resul\u019fng in the overpayment of the salaries of the said employees and thereby causing a \ufb01nancial loss to the Respondent. 9) It transpired in evidence that the aforesaid employees had been in the employment of the Respondent at the \u019fme the Department of Management Services formally approved the cadre posi\u019fons of those employees including the Applicant in 2008. The posi\u019fon taken up by the Respondent was that in accordance with the said Circulars, the employees in ques\u019fon should have been placed at the bo\u01a9om step of the salary scale from the point approval was granted by the Department of Management Services. However, since these employees were already in service and had earned several salary increments, in calcula\u019fng the salaries, it was alleged that the Applicant had taken into considera\u019fon their period of service prior to 2009,",
