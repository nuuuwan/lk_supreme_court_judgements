The Applicant-Appellant-Respondent (Respondent) was an employee of the Respondent-

Respondent-Appellant (Appellant).

In November, 2018 the Respondent made an application to the Labour Tribunal of

Panadura alleging that the Appellant had unjustly and unlawfully terminated his services.

After inquiry, the Labour Tribunal held that the Appellant had acted mala fide in

terminating the services of the Respondent. The termination was held to be unjust and

unlawful.

However the Labour tribunal did not order reinstatement as it could be an impediment to

industrial peace. Instead, compensation was awarded in a sum of Rs. 318,000/= which

amounted to 06 months basic salary.

The Respondent appealed to the High Court of the Western Province holden in Panadura

(High Court). At the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant raised a preliminary objection

that the appeal was out of time. The learned High Court Judge overruled the preliminary

objection.

The Appellant sought leave to appeal against the said order. Leave to appeal has been

granted on the following question of law:

Did the Learned High Court Judge err in law in computation of the time applicable

for filing of appeals from the awards made by the Labour Tribunal to the High

Court?

At the outset, it must be elucidated that we are not dealing with a law that was enacted

in English prior to the 1972 Constitution. In such cases, the Court will be guided by the

language in which the law was enacted.

In Attorney-General v. Herath Mudiyanselage Hamyge Herath Banda [(1983) Bar

Association Law Journal Reports Vol. I Part III 108] it was held that the Bribery Act was

enacted in English and for the purposes of legal work it could not be considered in any

other language. [See Chandrawathi v. Wijewickrama (S.C. Appeal 177/2016, S.C.M.

28.07.2022 at page 5)].

The Industrial Disputes (Hearing and Determination of Proceedings) (Special Provisions)

Act No. 13 of 2003 (Act) was enacted under the 1978 Constitution. Section 6(1) of

specifies the time limit within which a petition of appeal must be filed. The English text of

the Act reads as follows:

A petition of appeal made under section 31D of the Industrial Disputes Act against

an order made by a labour tribunal, shall be filed within a period of thirty days

(including the day on which the order appealed from was made, but excluding

Page 5 of 10

Sundays and Public Holidays) of the date of the making of the order from which

the appeal is preferred. (emphasis added)

However, the Sinhala text of Section 6(1) of the Act reads as follows:

31 (

)

. (emphasis added)

There is a clear discrepancy between the Sinhala and English texts. According to the

English text, Sundays and Public Holidays must be excluded in the computation whereas

the Sinhala text requires the exclusion of Sundays and Poya Days.

The order of the Labour Tribunal was pronounced on 15.12.2020. The petition of appeal

in this case was filed in the High Court on 20.01.2021 at 4.00 p.m.

If time is computed based upon the Sinhala text of the Act, the petition of appeal was filed

on the 31st day calculated by including the day on which the order was pronounced but

excluding Sundays and Poya days. Then the petition of appeal is out of time by one day.

However, during this period there were two public holidays, namely 25 December 2020

(Christmas) and 14th January 2021 (Thai Pongal). Should the English text of the Act prevail,

the petition of appeal is within time.

The learned High Court judge relied on the English text and concluded that the Sinhala

text refers to Poya Days rather than Public Holidays due to an error which ought to be

corrected to read as Public Holidays. He therefore held that the holidays for Christmas and

Thai Pongal should be excluded in computing the time.

The Tamil text of Section 6(1) of the Act reads as follows:

ifj;njhopy; gpzf;Fr;rl;lk; gpupT 31D ,w;F mika XH njhopy; epaha

rigapd; Mizf;F vjpuhf gjpag;gLk; XH Nkd;KiwaPl;L kDthdJ

cs;slq;fhJ) gjpT nra;ag;gly; Ntz;Lk;.

Therefore, the Tamil and English texts of Section 6(1) of the Act are consistent in requiring

Sundays and Public Holidays to be excluded in the computation of time.

However, Section 18 of the Sinhala text of the Act provides that in the event of any

inconsistency or discrepancy between the Sinhala and Tamil texts, the Sinhala text shall

prevail. The foundation of this legislative direction is Article 23(1) of the Constitution

which reads as follows:

23(1) All laws and subordinate legislation shall be enacted or made and published

in Sinhala and Tamil, together with a translation thereof in English;

Provided that Parliament shall, at the stage of enactment of any law

determine which text shall prevail in the event of any inconsistency between

texts;

Provided further that in respect of all other written laws the text in which

such written laws were enacted or adopted or made, shall prevail in the

event of any inconsistency between such texts.

The following points can be made:

1. All laws and subordinate legislation shall be enacted or made and published in

Sinhala and Tamil.

2. Such enactment or making and publication must be with a translation thereof in

English.

Page 7 of 10

3. However, Parliament can, at the stage of enactment or making of any law,

determine whether the Sinhala or Tamil text shall prevail in the event of any

inconsistency between those texts.

It is important to observe that Article 23(1) as originally enacted in 1978 read as follows:

All laws and subordinate legislation shall be enacted or made, and published, in

both National Languages together with a translation in the English Language. In

the event of any inconsistency between any two texts, the text in the Official

Language shall prevail.

Article 18 specified the Official Language to be Sinhala. Article 19 specified the National

Languages to be Sinhala and Tamil. Hence original the intention of the legislature under

the 1978 Constitution was that all laws shall be enacted and published both in Sinhala and

Tamil together with a translation in the English Language. In the event of any inconsistency

between the Sinhala and Tamil or Sinhala and English texts, the text in Sinhala was to

prevail.

The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution amended Article 18 by making Tamil also

an Official Language and English, the link language. No amendment was made to Article

23(1). Hence after the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, the legislature was required

to enact or make legislation in both official Languages, namely Sinhala and Tamil

languages. There was no specific provision in the Constitution to deal with situations

where there was any inconsistency between the Sinhala and Tamil texts as both were now

Official Languages.

However, the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, which came into effect on 17.12.1988,

amended Article 23(1) and brought in the present formulation which allows the legislature

to determine, at the stage of enactment of any law, which text shall prevail in the event

of any inconsistency between texts.

Page 8 of 10

The legislative history provides a clear indication of the intention of the legislature to vest

on itself the power to determine which text shall prevail in the event of any inconsistency.

There is no opportunity for any court to embark upon a voyage of interpretative discovery

given the clear and unambiguous words used by the legislature to set forth its intention

acting in terms of the powers vested in it by Article 23(1).

Unfortunately the learned High Court judge did exactly that and thereby sought to clothe

himself with legislative power in an attempt to correct what he perceived to be a mistake

in the Sinhala text. Should there be any mistake in the Sinhala text, it is up to Parliament

to remedy it. That legislative function cannot be usurped by any court of law under the

charade of legislative interpretation.

The learned High Court judge inter alia held:

(a) Article 9 of the Constitution enshrines that while Buddhism is to be given the

foremost place, the State has to assure to all other religions, the rights guaranteed

by the Constitution;

(b) However, if Public and Bank Holidays declared under the Holidays Act No. 29 of

1971 (Holidays Act) such as Christmas and Thai Pongal are not included as dates

to be excluded when computing time for purposes of Section 6(1) of the Act, it

would tantamount to a breach of the duty cast on the State to protect the rights

guaranteed to all other religions under Article 9 of the Constitution;

(c) On the other hand, even in terms of computing days under Section 754(4) of the

Civil Procedure Code and Section 321(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the

legislature has decided that Sundays as well as Public holidays (Government

holidays) are to be excluded.

Page 9 of 10

However, Section 18 of the Holidays Act defines Full Moon Poya Day to mean any day

which is declared to be a Full Moon Poya Day by Order for the time being in force made

by the Minister under the Holidays Act and Public Holiday to mean any day which is a

public holiday by virtue of the operation of the provisions of the Holidays Act.

The First Schedule of the Holidays Act titled Public Holidays inter alia lists both

Christmas and Thai Pongal as Public Holidays. According to Section 2 therein, every

Full Moon Poya Day shall be a public holiday. Clearly the Holidays Act provides for two

different procedures to be followed in specifying Public Holidays and Poya Days. The

learned High Court judge erred in proceeding on the basis that Christmas and Thai

Pongal should be equated to Poya Day in determining the days to be excluded in the

computation of time.

Furthermore, the learned High Court judge erred in proceeding on the basis that in

practice a Bill is drafted in English and then translated to Sinhala and Tamil. Whatever may

be the practice of drafting legislation, a Court cannot ignore the direction the legislature

has made on itself in Article 23(1) that all laws and subordinate legislation shall be enacted

or made and published in Sinhala and Tamil, together with a translation thereof in English.

I must add in closing that previously Court has on several occasions given primacy to the

Sinhala text when there was an inconsistency between the Sinhala and English texts [See

In the matter of a Reference under Article 154H(4) of the Constitution for a

Determination relating to the Transport Board Statute (Take Over of Assets &

Liabilities of Northern & Eastern Province Transport Board) (S.C. No. 7/89 (Special),

S.C.M. 22.02.1990); Don Tilakaratne v. Indra Priyadarshanie Mandawala [(2011) 2 Sri

LR 280 at 290]; Tropical Island Commodities (Private) Limited v. Mediterranean Shipping

Company (S.C. Appeal 137/2015, S.C.M. 03.12.2018 at 4-5); Subeya Hakuru Susilrathne

v. Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and Others (S.C.

Appeal 10/2024, S.C.M. 03.05.2024 at 8)].

Page 10 of 10

In summary, the Sinhala text of Section 6(1) of the Act prevails in the event of any

inconsistency with either the Tamil or English text. Therefore, only Sundays and Poya Days

should be excluded in the computation of time. The learned High Court judge erred in

excluding Christmas and Thai Pongal. The petition of appeal of the Respondent filed in the

High Court is out of time.

For all the foregoing reasons, I answer the question of law in the affirmative and allow the

appeal. The order of the learned High Court judge dated 22.11.2021 is set aside.

The petition of appeal of the Respondent filed in the High Court is dismissed as it has been

filed out of time. The order of the Labour Tribunal of Panadura dated 15.12.2020 stands.

Appeal allowed. Parties shall bear their costs.

In conclusion, I must place on record my concern on a recurring problem which has, in this

case, led to this appeal. There have been several instances previously where we have had

reason to comment on the discrepancy between the Sinhala and English texts of Bills in

the process of enactment or making of legislation [See Anti-Corruption Bill Determination

(S.C.S.D. 16-21/2023 at 78-79); Ayurveda (Amendment) Bill Special Determination

(S.C.S.D. Nos. 22-24, 34-35, 52, 55, 57/2023 at 55)]. I am once again drawing the attention

of the legislature to this recurring problem with the hope that effective remedial steps will

be taken to address it early.
