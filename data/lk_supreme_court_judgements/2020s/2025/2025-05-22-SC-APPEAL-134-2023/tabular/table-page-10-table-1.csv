"In  summary,  the  Sinhala  text  of  Section  6(1)  of  the  Act  prevails  in  the  event  of  any"
"inconsistency with either the Tamil or English text. Therefore, only Sundays and Poya Days"
"should be excluded in the computation of time. The learned High Court judge erred in"
"excluding Christmas and Thai Pongal. The petition of appeal of the Respondent filed in the"
"High Court is out of time."
"For all the foregoing reasons, I answer the question of law in the affirmative and allow the"
"appeal. The order of the learned High Court judge dated 22.11.2021 is set aside."
"The petition of appeal of the Respondent filed in the High Court is dismissed as it has been"
"filed out of time. The order of the Labour Tribunal of Panadura dated 15.12.2020 stands."
"Appeal allowed. Parties shall bear their costs."
"In conclusion, I must place on record my concern on a recurring problem which has, in this"
"case, led to this appeal. There have been several instances previously where we have had"
"reason to comment on the discrepancy between the Sinhala and English texts of Bills in"
"the process of enactment or making of legislation [See Anti-Corruption Bill Determination"
"(S.C.S.D.  16-21/2023  at  78-79);  Ayurveda  (Amendment)  Bill  Special  Determination"
"(S.C.S.D. Nos. 22-24, 34-35, 52, 55, 57/2023 at 55)]. I am once again drawing the attention"
"of the legislature to this recurring problem with the hope that effective remedial steps will"
"be taken to address it early."
