"However, the Sinhala text of Section 6(1) of the Act reads as follows:"
"“කම්කරු විනිශ්චය අධිකාරියක් විසින් කරනු ලබන ආඥාවකට එරරහිව කාර්මික ආරවුල්"

"කරනු ලැබුරේ යම් ආඥාවකට එරරහිව ද ඒ ආඥාව කරනු ලැබූ දිනයද ඇතුළුව එරෙේ ඉරිදා"

"There  is  a  clear  discrepancy  between  the  Sinhala  and  English  texts.  According  to  the"
"English text, Sundays and Public Holidays must be excluded in the computation whereas"

"The order of the Labour Tribunal was pronounced on 15.12.2020. The petition of appeal"
"in this case was filed in the High Court on 20.01.2021 at 4.00 p.m."
"If time is computed based upon the Sinhala text of the Act, the petition of appeal was filed"
"on the 31st day calculated by including the day on which the order was pronounced but"
"excluding Sundays and Poya days. Then the petition of appeal is out of time by one day."
"However, during this period there were two public holidays, namely 25 December 2020"
"(Christmas) and 14th January 2021 (Thai Pongal). Should the English text of the Act prevail,"
"the petition of appeal is within time."
"The learned High Court judge relied on the English text and concluded that the Sinhala"
"text refers to Poya Days rather than Public Holidays due to an error which ought to be"
"corrected to read as Public Holidays. He therefore held that the holidays for Christmas and"
"Thai Pongal should be excluded in computing the time."
