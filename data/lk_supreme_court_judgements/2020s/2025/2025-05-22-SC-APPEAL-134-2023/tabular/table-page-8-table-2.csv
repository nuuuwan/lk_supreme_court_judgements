"The learned High Court judge inter alia held:"
"(a) Article  9  of  the  Constitution  enshrines  that  while  Buddhism  is  to  be  given  the"
"foremost place, the State has to assure to all other religions, the rights guaranteed"
"by the Constitution;"
"(b) However, if Public and Bank Holidays declared under the Holidays Act No. 29 of"
"1971 (“Holidays Act”) such as Christmas and Thai Pongal are not included as dates"
"to be  excluded  when  computing  time for purposes of Section 6(1)  of the Act, it"
"would tantamount to a breach of the duty cast on the State to protect the rights"
"guaranteed to all other religions under Article 9 of the Constitution;"
"(c) On the other hand, even in terms of computing days under Section 754(4) of the"
"Civil  Procedure  Code  and  Section  321(1)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,  the"
"legislature  has  decided  that  “Sundays”  as  well  as  “Public  holidays  (Government"
"holidays)” are to be excluded."
