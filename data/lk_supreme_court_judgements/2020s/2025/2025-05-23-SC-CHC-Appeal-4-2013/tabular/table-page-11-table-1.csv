"consequently, no liability has arisen on the part of the 2nd Defendant also under and in terms of the"
"said Agreements marked as '1D4', '1D5' and '1D6' in respect thereof. It is also argued that the above"
"situation had resulted in extinguishing the liability of both the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant"
"in respect of the said acts of infringement of copyright belonging to the estate of late Clarance"
"Wijewardene committed by the 1st Defendant. It is the position of the Counsel of the Plaintiff that,"
"had  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  been  pleased  to  grant  relief  by  way  of  damages  and/or"
"compensation to the Plaintiff against the 1st Defendant in respect of the acts of infringement of"
"copyright belonging to the estate of late Clarance Wijewardene committed by the 1st Defendant,"
"under  and  in  terms  of  the  said Agreements  marked  as  '1D4',  '1D5'  and  'ID6',  the  1st  Defendant"
"would have become entitled to call upon the 2nd Defendant to satisfy such Judgment made against"
"the  1st  Defendant  in  favour  of  the  Plaintiff  or  recover  losses  and  damages  occasioned  to  him"
"pursuant to such Judgement."
"It is true that, if the Court decided to grant damages or compensations against the 1st Defendant,"
"the  1st  Defendant  may  have  the  possibility  to  sue  the  2nd  Defendant  to  recover  it  from  the  2nd"
"Defendant relying on the said three agreements which may pave way for multiplicity of actions"
"since all those agreements had a clause to indicate that the 2nd Defendant has agreed to indemnify"
"and hold harmless the 1st Defendant. However, as said before, I cannot find that the learned High"
"Court Judge was trying to enforce those agreements when the case after the settlement was between"
"the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff, who was not a party to said agreements, through his judgment."
"(Perhaps, enforcement of the said agreements may give the same result but to say that the decision"
"was to enforce the agreements then there should be a finding that the 1st Defendant is liable to pay"
"a certain amount and, as it should be paid by the 2nd Defendant as per the said agreements, it is not"
"going  to  be  recovered  from  the  1st  Defendant).  In  fact,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  at  one"
"occasion, as said before, has referred to the possible unenforceability of the said agreements (vide"
"page  14  of  the  Judgment).  Further,  the  learned  High  Court  Judge  at  page  15  of  the  Judgment"
"mentions that, owing to the settlement by the Plaintiff with the 2nd Defendant, inability of the Court"
"to order further compensation to be paid by the 2nd Defendant. This indicates, that if there was no"
"settlement between them, the learned High Court Judge was prepared to impose the liability of"
"paying compensation on the 2nd Defendant based on the evidence led. In fact, the evidence led"
"including the said agreements indicated that it was the 2nd Defendant, who, by misrepresentation"
"as to the ownership of the intellectual property rights, deceptively got the 1st Defendant to commit"
