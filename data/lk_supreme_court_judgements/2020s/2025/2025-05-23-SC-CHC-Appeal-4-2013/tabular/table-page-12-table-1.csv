"the infringing acts as alleged. Thus, it is not wrong to recognize the 2nd Defendant as the one who"
"is really responsible for the compensation to be paid for the infringements. However, being misled"
"by  the  misrepresentation,  by  reproduction  and  distribution  etc.,  the  1st  Defendant  would  have"
"earned a profit but as explained below, no steps have been taken prior to the judgment to call for"
"the accounts and prove such profit to grant any relief in terms of prayer ‘f’ of the Plaint. Therefore,"
"I cannot find fault with the learned High Judge for not granting relief against the 1st Defendant in"
"terms of prayer ‘c’ of the Plaint as it was within his power to decide respective liability in terms of"
"Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Code based on evidence. In that backdrop, the contention that"
"the indemnifying the 1st Defendant arises only after the liability of the 1st Defendant is decided"
"does not arise. On the other hand, what has happened was not extinguishing of the liability to pay"
"compensation but the person, who the learned High Court Judge has observed as the person who"
"should be liable to pay the compensation, and the Plaintiff settling that liability for a lesser amount."

"respective liability to deliver them, it cannot be correct to think that the liability to hand over the"
"infringing material with the 1st Defendant is not with him due to the facts revealed through said"
"agreements. As per the said agreements, it was the 1st Defendant who was to reproduce, distributes"
"or duplicate the material containing the works referred to in the agreements. As the infringement"
"was  established,  I  think  prayer  ‘d’  should  have  been  granted  to  the  Plaintiff  against  the  1st"
"Defendant. In that regard, it is my view that the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge should"
"stand amended."
"It must be noted that the prayer ‘e’ and ‘f’ in the Plaint are interconnected and included in the Plaint"
