"wrong doing. However, the sum contemplated in prayer ‘f’ has to be decided only after perusing"
"the accounts referred to in prayer ‘e’. Thus, without leading evidence before the Judgment, a Court"
"cannot decide the sum referred to in prayer ‘f’ of the plaint. Mere granting of said reliefs in prayer"
"‘e’ and ‘f’ at the final judgment will not serve any effective and useful purpose due to the fact that"
"even a false account may be tendered indicating a loss.  As trial is concluded, no opportunity is"
"available  for  the  verification  as  to  the  truth  of  the  accounts. Thus,  I  do  not  intend  to  consider"
"whether this Court should interfere with the refusal of the learned High Court Judge to grant said"
"reliefs  contemplated  in  said  prayers  ‘e’  and  ‘f’.  Perhaps  the  provisions  contained  in  Chapter"
"XXXVII of the Civil Procedure Code could have been useful to the Plaintiff if she had used such"
"interlocutory measures for accounts to be taken by the Court. As such measures were not taken to"
"prove any profits prior to the judgment, as said before, the High Court was not in a position to"
"decide the profit to grant relief as per prayer ‘f’ of the Plaint irrespective of the reason to refuse"
"the said prayers in the Judgment. Hence, this Court does not wish to interfere with the decision of"
"the learned High Court Judge to refuse the reliefs in prayer ‘e’ and ‘f’ of the Plaint irrespective of"
"the reason it was refused."
"The Counsel for the 1st Defendant has contended that as the action has been filed based on the joint"
"liability, in the circumstances of this case, it is logical and common sensical that no further reliefs"
"can be sought once one of Defendants to a joint action has settled the case with the Plaintiff. This"
"contention  might  have  been  based  on  the  English  law  principles  relating  to  joint  liability  that"
"judgment against one joint debtor discharge the others, even though the judgment has not been"
"satisfied – see Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts volume 1 Section 575. These principles"
"have  been  followed  by  our  courts  where  English  law  applies-  vide  Suppiaya  Reddiar  Vs"
"Mohamed 39 N L R 459, Manuel Istaky Vs Sinnatamby 13 N L R 284. However, our Courts"
"have  on  certain  occasions  deviate  from  applying  such  rules  to  avoid  injustice  –  vide  Dias  Vs"
"Eastern Hardware Stores Ltd. 60 N L R 284. However, as per Sections 3 and 4 of the Civil Law"
"Ordinance, matters relating to Intellectual Property has not been identified as an area English law"
"applies.  In  fact,  Intellectual  Property  could  not  have  been  in  contemplation  when  the  said"
"Ordinance was enacted. Our Intellectual Property Act is statutory law that has been passed by our"
"legislature. However, it is not a codification of any Roman Dutch law principles but might have"
"influenced by English law and various convention and treaties etc. However, as it is our own statute"
"one  cannot  argue  that  English  law  principles  should  be  strictly  apply.  On  the  other  hand,  even"
