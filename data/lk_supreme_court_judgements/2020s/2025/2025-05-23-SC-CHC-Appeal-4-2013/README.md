Argued on: 01.02.2022

Decided on: 23.05.2025

E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J.

This is an appeal filed by the Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff),

seeking for reliefs in prayers c, d, e and f of the original Plaint, in addition to the reliefs that

have already been granted by the Judgment of the Commercial High Court of the Western Province

3

Holden in Colombo dated 30.07.2012. What has been granted as the relief were the injunction

prayed for by the Plaintiff and the costs of the action.

The prayers c, d, e and f in the original Plaint is extracted as follows:

c. Judgment and decree against the Defendants in a sum of Rs. 20 Million or such

other sum as Court may find due to the Plaintiff on account of the loss suffered by the

Plaintiff as a consequence of the several acts of infringement by the Defendants,

together with legal interest from the date hereof until the date of decree and thereafter

on the decreetal amount until the payment in full.

d. an order to deliver up to the Plaintiff by the Defendants all the infringing material

in the possession of the Defendants including all copies of the Audio Compact Discs

and the Audio-Visual Work titled Sing along with RAJIV SEBASTIAN, Viduru Mal

Reka Heenen Piyamba and Torana SINHALA Karaoke Vol.2

e. an order to render accounts to the Plaintiff of the profits made by the Defendants

attributable to the infringement.

f. judgment and decree against the Defendants in such sum as found to be due to the

Plaintiff upon taking into account of profits made by the Defendants together with the

legal interest thereon.

The Plaintiff based her Plaint on four causes of action stating that the economic rights belonging

to the estate of late Clarance Arthur Somasinghe Wijewardene (hereinafter referred to as late

Clarance Wijewardene) had been infringed by the 1st and 2nd Defendants-Respondents

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st and 2nd Defendants) in relation to the copy rights

attached to certain lyrics and music compositions as described in the Plaint and also for the

violation of moral rights attached to certain music compositions by distorting the said music

compositions as described in the Plaint. When one goes through the body of the Plaint and the

prayer and consider them as a whole, it is understood that the position taken up in the Plaint is that

the Defendants are jointly liable for the causes of action described therein. Both Defendants first

filed a joint answer refuting the claims of the Plaintiff and praying for the dismissal of the

Plaintiffs action. However, before the cross examination commenced on the evidence in chief

tendered by way of an affidavit, the 2nd Defendant came to a settlement with the Plaintiff. The first

4

settlement was not properly adhered by the 2nd Defendant but the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant

re-adjusted the terms and entered into a settlement, among other things, to pay Rs.2 million

including the Rs. 500,000/- that had already been paid, while admitting the said intellectual

property rights of late Clarance Wijewardene. Meanwhile, the 1st Defendant moved to amend the

answer which was objected by the Plaintiff. However, the High Court allowed the amendment and

accordingly an amended answer was filed by the 1st Defendant. The said decision to allow the

amended answer had not been challenged in appeal.

Based on the consolidated admissions and issues, case was fixed for trial on 07 admissions and 44

issues. After the trial, the learned High Court Judge answered the issues and through such answers,

decided that the intellectual property rights, namely the impugned economic rights and moral

rights as pleaded in the Plaint, belongs to the late Clarance Wijewardanes estate and those rights

have been infringed but granted only two reliefs in favour of the Plaintiff, namely the injunction

that had been prayed for and costs of the action against the 1st Defendant, but refused to grant

aforementioned reliefs contained in prayers c, d, e and f of the prayer to the Plaint.

The 1st Defendant did not appeal against the Judgment of the High Court which found

infringements of the intellectual property rights that belongs to the estate of the late Clarance

Wijewardene nor, it appears, that he took steps to challenge it in terms of Section 772 of the Civil

Procedure Code. Thus, findings relating to the infringements of such rights need not be scrutinized

in this Judgment. Thus, what has to be decided in this appeal is that, after finding that alleged

infringements had occurred, whether the learned High Court Judge was correct to decide not to

grant the reliefs as prayed for in prayer c, d, e, and f of the Plaint.

Firstly, I prefer to consider the refusal of prayer c mentioned above:

What is quoted below from the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge explicates the reasons

adduced by the learned High Court Judge for his refusal to grant the said reliefs.

"The Court is not inclined to order the 1" defendant to pay compensation/damages to the plaintiff

for violation of the copyrights of the late Mr. Clarance Wijewardena in the unique facts and

circumstances of this case, especially in view of the Agreements marked 1D4, 1D5, and 1D6

entered into between the 1st and 2nd defendants, whereby the 2nd defendant singlehandedly

accepted all the liabilities arising out of those Agreements, and particularly the knowledge both

5

the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant had about those Agreements and the defence taken up by the 1"

defendant, when the plaintiff and the 2nd defendant decided to settle the case conditionally" (vide

page 702 of the brief).{emphasis by me}

It must be noted that the Plaintiff was not a party to the said Agreements marked 1D4, 1D5 and

1D6, and they were agreements between the 1st and the 2nd Defendant where, among other things,

the 2nd Defendant had represented to the 1st Defendant that he was the owner of the works set forth

in them, including subject matters of the instant action, and further had agreed to indemnify and

hold the 1st Defendant harmless against any loss, liability, damages or judgments in respect of the

production , reproduction or distribution etc. of the said works that may be arisen due to the breach

of the said representation.

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff has brought to the attention of Court that the 1st Defendant

had not preferred an appeal from the said Judgment of the learned High Court Judge and

accordingly, the said findings of the learned High Court Judge remain unassailed as to the

wrongdoing of the 1st Defendant regarding the alleged infringements of the intellectual property

rights, and thus, it is argued that in the aforesaid circumstances, a flagrant violation of the rights

belonging to the estate of the late Clarance Wijewardene by the 1st Defendant had been established

and accordingly, the Plaintiff is in law entitled for an award of damages. In this regard, the Courts

attention has been invited to the following passage from Lionel Bently and Brad Sherman,

'Intellectual Property Law' (Indian Edition) at p. 1023.

"The most common remedy for infringement of intellectual property rights is an award of damages.

The damages recoverable are the same as with other torts: the aim is to restore the victim to the

position he or she would have been in if no wrong had been committed: it does not aim to punish

the defendant."

It is also noted that this is not an action to enforce those three agreements and even the 1st

Defendant could not have made a claim in reconvention in this case against the 2nd Defendant even

if the 2nd Defendant remained as a party without being released due to the settlement between the

2nd defendant and the Plaintiff since claim in reconvention can be made only against the Plaintiff

as claim in reconvention are made in the answer in reply to the Plaint. A claim in reconvention has

to be a claim that can be adjusted or set off with the claim in the Plaint- vide Section 75 of the

Civil Procedure Code and Silva Vs Perera 17 N L R 206. This does not mean that when they were

6

marked in evidence, the Court cannot consider them as evidential materials in coming to a decision

to do justice. Aforesaid three agreements were tendered along with affidavit evidence of the 1st

Defendant tendered as evidence-in-chief of his evidence and the only objection was based on that

they were photocopies thus subject to tendering the originals-vide proceedings dated 15.11.2011.

Originals were shown on 11.05.2012- vide proceedings dated 11.05.2012.

Even though the Counsel for the Plaintiffs state that 1st Defendant was found liable for the flagrant

violation of the intellectual property rights of the estate of late Clarance Wijewardene, the said

three agreements marked in evidence indicate that it was the 2nd Defendant who misrepresented

and deceived the 1st Respondent to cause the infringements. However, the Plaintiff entered into a

settlement with the 2nd Defendant for a lesser amount than she has claimed as damages in the Plaint

but proceeded against the 1st Defendant to claim the whole amount.

As per Section 22 of the Intellectual Property Act of 2003, the High Court hearing the case has

power to grant damages for infringements including the infringements of moral rights. Section 21

of the 1979 Act similarly recognized this power of Court to grant damages for infringements

including infringements of moral rights Vide Director, Department of Fisheries and Aquatic

Resources and Three Others v. C. Aloy. W. Fernando and Five Others. [Cabral's IP Law

Reports (Volume II) 1010 at 1037].

Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Code which is quoted below is s also important in this regard.

All persons may be joined as defendants against whom the right to any relief is alleged to exist,

whether jointly, severally, or in the alternative, in respect of the same cause of action. And

judgment may be given against such one or more of the Defendants as may be found to be liable,

according to their respective liabilities, without any amendment. (emphasis by me)

Aforementioned Section, as Counsel of the Plaintiff also submits, empowers the Court to grant

judgment against individual Defendants based on their respective liabilities, irrespective of

whether the action had been instituted against defendants for them to be liable jointly, severally or

in the alternative. Thus, even though, the Plaint in the case at hand has alleged joint liability of the

Defendants, the Court has the discretion to give judgment according to their respective liabilities.

It is true that the decision of the learned High Court Judge not to grant relief by way of damages

and/or compensation to the Plaintiff has referred to the three (3) Agreements mentioned above,

7

marked as 1D4,1D5 and 1D6. As said before, they had been entered into between the 1st Defendant

and the 2nd Defendant, and the 2nd Defendant had represented himself to be the owner of the

impugned works, which had been found by the High Court as works on which the intellectual

property rights belong to the estate of late Clarance Wijewardene exists. As said before, the

Plaintiff was not a party to the said Agreements marked as '1D4', '1D5' and '1D6'.

In this regard, while referring to Viscount Haldane LC in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v

Selfridge and Co. Ltd. [1915] AC 847, HL, the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff contends that;

The principle of privity of contract dictates that a contract creates rights and imposes

obligations only between the parties thereto.

Only a person who is a party to a contract can sue on it and a stranger to a contract cannot

enforce the contract.

For a person, with whom a contract not under seal has been made, is to be able to enforce

it, consideration must have been given by him to the promisor or to some other person at

the promisor's request. However, a principal not named in the contract may sue upon it if

the promisee really contracted as his agent. But again, in order to entitle him so to sue, he

must have given consideration either personally or through the promisee, acting as his

agent in giving it.

Hence the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff endeavored to indicate that the Plaintiff had nothing to

do with the said agreements and was not in a position to enforce it but the obligation created by

those agreements are between the 1st and the 2nd Defendants. This Court also accept that the

Plaintiff was not a party to the said contracts and there for not a person who can enforce those

contracts and those contracts have created obligations only between the 1st Defendant and the 2nd

Defendant. However, what has to be looked into is whether the refusal of reliefs prayed for through

prayers c, d, e, and f of the Plaint can be attributed to a misconception or forgetfulness of

the principles relating to privity of contract or some other ground that may have a legal or

justifiable basis.

It must be noted that an amended answer was allowed by the High Court even after the first date

fixed for trial and the reason recorded for the permission to amendment was the conduct of the 2nd

Defendant who first filed a joint answer with the 1st Defendant and thereafter came to a settlement

8

with the Plaintiff leaving out the 1st Defendant while there was an undertaking, as per the said

agreements, to indemnify and hold harmless the 1st Defendant from any liabilities that may arise

vide Order dated 08.07.2009. The said Order specifically states that the said amendment is vital

as the said amendment would decide whether the 1st Defendant is liable to pay damages to the

Plaintiff as prayed for in the Plaint. By the amended answer, among other things, after revealing

the existence of the said three agreements, the 1st Defendant had averred that if there is any money

to be recovered by the Plaintiff, it should be recovered from the 2nd Defendant and not from the 1st

Defendant, and at the end had prayed to dismiss the Plaintiffs action. If the learned High Court

Judge misconceived the facts and law and thought that the Plaintiff should have enforced the said

three agreements without proceedings against the 1st Defendant, the result would have been the

dismissal of the action against the 1st Defendant. Anyhow, the Judgment was not to dismiss the

action against the 1st Defendant. In fact, it is against the 1st Defendant and the prayer for injunction

has been granted along with costs of the action in favour of the Plaintiff. In my view, nothing is

mentioned in the reasoning of the learned High Court Judge in the impugn judgment to indicate

that refusal to grant reliefs prayed in prayer c, d, e, and f was due to a misconception of the

principles relating to privity of contract or forgetfulness of said principles as contended by the

Counsel of the Plaintiff. Then, a question arises whether there was any legal or justifiable basis for

this refusal other than that.

What the learned High Court Judge has stated is that the Court is not inclined to order the 1st

Defendant to pay compensation/damages to the Plaintiff for violation of the copyrights of the late

Clarance Wijewardena in the unique facts and circumstances of this case, especially in view of the

Agreements marked 1D4, 1D5, and 1D6 entered into between the 1st and 2nd Defendants, whereby

the 2nd Defendant singlehandedly accepted all the liabilities arising out of those Agreements. At

one place, the learned High Court judge considers the possible unenforceability of the aforesaid

three agreements and in another place, Courts inability to order further compensation to be paid

by the 2nd Defendant due to the settlement. Thus, it is indicated that the learned High Court Judge

considered evidence before the Court, especially the three agreements and decided that it is not

proper to decide that the monetary liability should be imposed on the 1st Defendant and it is what

should have been imposed on the 2nd Defendant, if the 2nd Defendant continued to be a party.

Though, it is not stated by clear words, there is an indication that if the 2nd Defendant remained a

Defendant without settling the matter with the Plaintiff to get himself discharged from the

9

proceedings, the liability to monetary claims, namely damages and or compensation etc. should

have been imposed on the 2nd Defendant using the Courts discretion. In my view, this could have

been done if the 2nd Defendant remained a party to the action in terms of the aforequoted Section

14 of the Civil Procedure Code even if the Plaint had been filed alleging joint liability as explained

above since the said section contemplates a judgment to be given according to the respective

liabilities of the Defendants. Merely because the Plaintiff entered into a settlement with one of the

Defendants, taking away the Courts ability to use discretion on the respective liabilities as

contemplated by aforesaid Section 14 on the said Defendant who entered into a settlement, the

Court should not impose the said liability that could have been imposed on the one who entered

into settlement with the Plaintiff on the remaining Defendant or Defendants. The discretion that

the Court has in terms of Section 14 of the Civil procedure Code to decide respective liabilities

should not be affected owing to any settlement entered between the Plaintiff and one or some of

the Defendants.

On the other hand, if there is a doubt as to why a Court acted in a certain manner, if it can be

referrable to a provision of law or a legal basis, in my view it has to be presumed that it was so

happened due to that legal basis. What the Plaintiff has done was, before the Court decide the

respective liabilities of the Defendants, to enter into a settlement with 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiff

must face the consequences of such a settlement as Section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code

provides for adjustment of actions wholly or in part and once the decree is passed it becomes final

between the parties. Referring to Mack v. Perera 33 NLR 179 at 180-181 it is pointed out when

money is paid, it is to be applied according to the expressed will of the payer, not of the receiver.

As such, it is argued that there is nothing in the settlement between the Plaintiff and the 2nd

Defendant to show that the payment made by the 2nd Defendant was also intended to release the

1st Defendant from his liability regarding the infringements. Factually this may be correct but it is

also clear that the 2nd Defendants payment was made to relieve the 2nd Defendant from his

liabilities of the alleged infringements. Thus, what was settled there was the liability that may come

upon the 2nd Defendant, if the case is continued against him. In other words, if the case was

continued against him, what may be decided as his respective liability in terms of Section 14 of

the Civil Procedure Code by the Judge has been settled for an agreed value by the parties to the

settlement. Decision of the respective liability falls within the judgment of the Judge on evidence

available to him. As explained above, it appears that the learned High Court Judge decided

10

respective liability with regard to prayer c, d, e, and f should not fall on the 1st Defendant as

per the evidence available but should fall on the 2nd Defendant. Thus, this Court does not see that

the decision to not grant prayer c which contemplates the compensation or damages against the

1st Defendant was not based on a misconception or the forgetfulness of the principles relating to

privity of contracts as urged by the Counsel for the Plaintiff but a decision taken on available

evidence in deciding respective liabilities in terms of Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Code which

is within the power of the High Court and also the task of the High Court in judgment. //

On the other hand, the learned High Court Judge could have observed that it is unreasonable to

impose the liability for damages or compensation on the 1st Defendant as per evidence revealed by

the said agreements, it was the 2nd Defendant who misrepresented and deceived the 1st Defendant

as to the ownership of the intellectual property rights in issue and got the 1st Defendant to take part

in the infringements and the 1st Defendant was merely instrumental in the infringing act due to

said misrepresentation, and as such the liabilities with regard to damages and compensation should

fall on the 2nd Defendant. I do not think it was an unreasonable view on the part of the learned

High Court Judge. That seems to be the reason, the learned High Court Judge had stated that due

to the unique facts and circumstances of this case especially in view of the said agreements he was

not inclined to grant relief relating to compensation and damages. It must also be mentioned here

that, as per Section 22 (2) (b) of the Intellectual Property Act, where the infringer did not know or

had no reasonable cause to know that he was engaged in infringing activity, the court may limit

damages to the profits or to pre-established damages. It is also noted what has been prayed as

damages is Rs. 20 million which has to be proved as against the statutory damage of which the

maximum limit is Rs. 10 million.

It is also contended on behalf of the Plaintiff that, under and in terms of the said Agreements

marked as '1D4', 'ID5' and '1D6', any obligation on the part of the 2nd Defendant to indemnify

arises only in favour of the 1st Defendant and conditional upon any loss, liability, damage or

judgment occurring to or being granted against the 1st Defendant. Hence, it is further contended

that due to the determination of the learned High Court Judge not to grant relief by way of damages

and/or compensation to the Plaintiff against the 1st Defendant, no liability has arisen on the part of

the 1st Defendant, in the first instance, in respect of the said acts of infringement of copyright

belonging to the estate of late Clarance Wijewardene committed by the 1st Defendant, and

11

consequently, no liability has arisen on the part of the 2nd Defendant also under and in terms of the

said Agreements marked as '1D4', '1D5' and '1D6' in respect thereof. It is also argued that the above

situation had resulted in extinguishing the liability of both the 1st Defendant and the 2nd Defendant

in respect of the said acts of infringement of copyright belonging to the estate of late Clarance

Wijewardene committed by the 1st Defendant. It is the position of the Counsel of the Plaintiff that,

had the learned High Court Judge been pleased to grant relief by way of damages and/or

compensation to the Plaintiff against the 1st Defendant in respect of the acts of infringement of

copyright belonging to the estate of late Clarance Wijewardene committed by the 1st Defendant,

under and in terms of the said Agreements marked as '1D4', '1D5' and 'ID6', the 1st Defendant

would have become entitled to call upon the 2nd Defendant to satisfy such Judgment made against

the 1st Defendant in favour of the Plaintiff or recover losses and damages occasioned to him

pursuant to such Judgement.

It is true that, if the Court decided to grant damages or compensations against the 1st Defendant,

the 1st Defendant may have the possibility to sue the 2nd Defendant to recover it from the 2nd

Defendant relying on the said three agreements which may pave way for multiplicity of actions

since all those agreements had a clause to indicate that the 2nd Defendant has agreed to indemnify

and hold harmless the 1st Defendant. However, as said before, I cannot find that the learned High

Court Judge was trying to enforce those agreements when the case after the settlement was between

the 1st Defendant and the Plaintiff, who was not a party to said agreements, through his judgment.

(Perhaps, enforcement of the said agreements may give the same result but to say that the decision

was to enforce the agreements then there should be a finding that the 1st Defendant is liable to pay

a certain amount and, as it should be paid by the 2nd Defendant as per the said agreements, it is not

going to be recovered from the 1st Defendant). In fact, the learned High Court Judge, at one

occasion, as said before, has referred to the possible unenforceability of the said agreements (vide

page 14 of the Judgment). Further, the learned High Court Judge at page 15 of the Judgment

mentions that, owing to the settlement by the Plaintiff with the 2nd Defendant, inability of the Court

to order further compensation to be paid by the 2nd Defendant. This indicates, that if there was no

settlement between them, the learned High Court Judge was prepared to impose the liability of

paying compensation on the 2nd Defendant based on the evidence led. In fact, the evidence led

including the said agreements indicated that it was the 2nd Defendant, who, by misrepresentation

as to the ownership of the intellectual property rights, deceptively got the 1st Defendant to commit

12

the infringing acts as alleged. Thus, it is not wrong to recognize the 2nd Defendant as the one who

is really responsible for the compensation to be paid for the infringements. However, being misled

by the misrepresentation, by reproduction and distribution etc., the 1st Defendant would have

earned a profit but as explained below, no steps have been taken prior to the judgment to call for

the accounts and prove such profit to grant any relief in terms of prayer f of the Plaint. Therefore,

I cannot find fault with the learned High Judge for not granting relief against the 1st Defendant in

terms of prayer c of the Plaint as it was within his power to decide respective liability in terms of

Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Code based on evidence. In that backdrop, the contention that

the indemnifying the 1st Defendant arises only after the liability of the 1st Defendant is decided

does not arise. On the other hand, what has happened was not extinguishing of the liability to pay

compensation but the person, who the learned High Court Judge has observed as the person who

should be liable to pay the compensation, and the Plaintiff settling that liability for a lesser amount.

Therefore, this Court does not think that this Court should interfere with the decision of the High

Court in relation to not granting prayer c as it is based on available evidence and relates to the

using of its discretion as to the respective liabilities in terms of Section 14 of the Civil Procedure

Code.

However, it appears that the High Court erred in not granting prayer d as prayed for in the Plaint.

Even though the Plaint is filed alleging joint liability, what it has been prayed in prayer d is to

hand over the infringing material that are in the possession of the Defendants. In deciding the

respective liability to deliver them, it cannot be correct to think that the liability to hand over the

infringing material with the 1st Defendant is not with him due to the facts revealed through said

agreements. As per the said agreements, it was the 1st Defendant who was to reproduce, distributes

or duplicate the material containing the works referred to in the agreements. As the infringement

was established, I think prayer d should have been granted to the Plaintiff against the 1st

Defendant. In that regard, it is my view that the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge should

stand amended.

It must be noted that the prayer e and f in the Plaint are interconnected and included in the Plaint

to get the profit earned by the wrong doers using the intellectual property rights of late Clarence

Wijewardene to be recovered as it should belong to the estate of the said Clarence Wijewardene as

well as the wrong doers should not be allowed to enjoy the profits which they earned through the

13

wrong doing. However, the sum contemplated in prayer f has to be decided only after perusing

the accounts referred to in prayer e. Thus, without leading evidence before the Judgment, a Court

cannot decide the sum referred to in prayer f of the plaint. Mere granting of said reliefs in prayer

e and f at the final judgment will not serve any effective and useful purpose due to the fact that

even a false account may be tendered indicating a loss. As trial is concluded, no opportunity is

available for the verification as to the truth of the accounts. Thus, I do not intend to consider

whether this Court should interfere with the refusal of the learned High Court Judge to grant said

reliefs contemplated in said prayers e and f. Perhaps the provisions contained in Chapter

XXXVII of the Civil Procedure Code could have been useful to the Plaintiff if she had used such

interlocutory measures for accounts to be taken by the Court. As such measures were not taken to

prove any profits prior to the judgment, as said before, the High Court was not in a position to

decide the profit to grant relief as per prayer f of the Plaint irrespective of the reason to refuse

the said prayers in the Judgment. Hence, this Court does not wish to interfere with the decision of

the learned High Court Judge to refuse the reliefs in prayer e and f of the Plaint irrespective of

the reason it was refused.

The Counsel for the 1st Defendant has contended that as the action has been filed based on the joint

liability, in the circumstances of this case, it is logical and common sensical that no further reliefs

can be sought once one of Defendants to a joint action has settled the case with the Plaintiff. This

contention might have been based on the English law principles relating to joint liability that

judgment against one joint debtor discharge the others, even though the judgment has not been

satisfied see Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts volume 1 Section 575. These principles

have been followed by our courts where English law applies- vide Suppiaya Reddiar Vs

Mohamed 39 N L R 459, Manuel Istaky Vs Sinnatamby 13 N L R 284. However, our Courts

have on certain occasions deviate from applying such rules to avoid injustice vide Dias Vs

Eastern Hardware Stores Ltd. 60 N L R 284. However, as per Sections 3 and 4 of the Civil Law

Ordinance, matters relating to Intellectual Property has not been identified as an area English law

applies. In fact, Intellectual Property could not have been in contemplation when the said

Ordinance was enacted. Our Intellectual Property Act is statutory law that has been passed by our

legislature. However, it is not a codification of any Roman Dutch law principles but might have

influenced by English law and various convention and treaties etc. However, as it is our own statute

one cannot argue that English law principles should be strictly apply. On the other hand, even

14

though it does not codify Roman Dutch Law, one may argue our Common Law principles should

be applied to joint liability issues which principles are different from English law as Intellectual

Property is not a subject where English law applies as per Civil Law Ordinance. As per Roman

Dutch Law principles judgment against one joint debtor does not bar action against others. - vide

Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts Volume 1 Section 563. However, my view is whether a

judgment against one bar the action against the others with joint liability falls within the discretion

of the court depending on the facts as Section 14 of the Civil Procedure Code provides for the

Court to decide respective liability. It is also contended by the Plaintiff that no objection or issue

was raised subsequent to the settlement regarding the continuation of the Action. It is not necessary

to discuss that as this Court does not come to the conclusion that action against the 1st Defendant

should have been dismissed after the settlement.

In my view, the aforesaid reasons are sufficient to partly allow the Appeal to grant the relief prayed

in prayer d of the Plaint in addition to the other reliefs granted by the learned High Court Judge.

Thus, the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge should stand amended in accordance with

this Judgment. The Plaintiff-Appellant is entitled to the costs of this Appeal.

Appeal partly allowed with costs.
