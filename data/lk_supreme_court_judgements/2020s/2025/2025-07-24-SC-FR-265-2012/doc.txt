alleged violations of Article 13(1) Article 13(2) and Article 11 of

the Constitution.

Factual Matrix

At the time of the alleged violation of his Fundamental Rights, the

Petitioner was attached to the Tangalle STF Camp as a Police

Constable. The Petitioner stated that the 1st Respondent was the

Officer-in-Charge of the Tissamaharama Police Station until he

was interdicted. The Petitioner stated that the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents were also officers attached to the Tissamaharama

Police Station and the 4th Respondent was the Acting Officer-in-

Charge of the Tangalle Police Station, while the 5th Respondent

served as the Zonal Commanding Officer of the STF in Suriyawewa.

The Petitioner stated that he enrolled in the STF on 16th April 2006

as a Police Constable. (A true copy of his letter of appointment

dated 19th September 2006 is annexed as P-01). The Petitioner

stated that thereafter, he served in various STF units and camps,

primarily in operational areas, including the Kundasale Police

Training School, Katukurunda STF Headquarters, Thirukkovil STF

Camp, Ampara STF Camp, Kalmunai STF Camp and finally the

Tangalle STF Camp, where he was stationed from 3rd August 2011

onwards.

The Petitioner stated that on 27th April 2012, the 2nd Respondent,

along with another unidentified police officer and several civilians,

arrived at the Tangalle STF Camp in a van bearing registration

number 56-5838. The 2nd Respondent recorded statements from

him as well as from another Sub-Inspector named Sampath, in

connection with an alleged abduction and the theft of a

"Walampuri" valued at Rs. 3 million.

5

The Petitioner further stated that on 28th April 2012, the

Tissamaharama police station issued a telephone message (No.

774) to the Officer-in-Charge of the Tangalle STF Camp,

instructing him to hand over the Petitioner and Sub-Inspector

named Sampath to the Tissamaharama police station. The

Petitioner claimed that he was handed over to the said police

station between 4:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. Subsequently, the

Officer-in-Charge of the Tangalle STF Camp recorded the return

entry under reference No. 377/3114 RIB at 9:15 p.m. on the same

day. (marked as 5R1 and 5R2)

According to the Petition, the Petitioner and Sub-Inspector

Sampath were detained at the Tissamaharama police station. On

the same night, when the Petitioner requested food from the 2nd

Respondent, the 4th Respondent insulted him and directed for him

to be taken to the Crime Branch. The Petitioner stated that at the

Crime Branch, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents forced him to strip

naked and kneel on the floor while interrogating him for

approximately half an hour. The Petitioner stated that he was not

given any food that night.

The Petitioner also stated that on 29th April 2012, at around 11.45

a.m., his brothers, Mery Nimal and Mery Sampath Kumara, visited

the police station to check on his condition. He stated that one of

his brothers, Mery Nimal (who was also a police officer) and the

other brother visited him again on 30th April and 1st May 2012. The

Petitioner stated that both brothers have submitted affidavits

confirming that he was unlawfully detained from 28th April to 1st

6

May 2012 without being produced before a Magistrate. These

affidavits are annexed as P-02A and P-02B.

The Petitioner further stated that on 29th April 2012, a person

named Dasun Sanjeewa, who had been detained on an assault

charge, was placed in the same cell. The Petitioner stated that

Dasun Sanjeewa was granted police bail and released a few hours

after being placed in the cell on 29th April 2012. At the time of his

release, the Petitioner was still in custody in the same cell. The

Petitioner also stated that Dasun Sanjeewa witnessed this and

subsequently submitted an affidavit confirming the Petitioners

continued detention. This affidavit is annexed as document P-03.

The Petitioner stated that on 1st May 2012, he and Sub-Inspector

Sampath were produced before the Acting Magistrate of

Tissamaharama. The Petitioner was represented by an Attorney-

at-Law who informed the court that the Petitioner had been

arrested on 28th April 2012. A certified copy of the B Report bearing

No. 254/12 is marked as X, and the application made is marked

as P-04.

The Petitioner stated that he was remanded until 8th May 2012 and

subsequently further remanded until 15th May 2012. He stated

that on 15th May 2012, an identification parade was conducted,

but he was not identified by any of the complainants. Nevertheless,

he was further remanded until 21st May 2012, on which date he

was granted bail. The Petitioner stated that although bail was

granted on 21st May 2012, he was only released on the 23rd May

2012. The Petitioner stated that, immediately after he was released

7

on bail he reported to the STF Camp Tangalle as he was summoned

to report back to the STF Camp of Tangalle.

The Petitioner stated that on 25th May 2012, he received a

telephone message bearing No. 685 issued at 1655 hours by the

5th Respondent, informing him that he had been interdicted with

immediate effect under Sections 27:08 and 27:10 of Chapter XLVIII

of Volume II of the Establishments Code due to his arrest and

remand. The Petitioner stated that he was ordered to hand over his

belongings and leave the camp. (A true copy of the said message is

annexed as P-06.)

The Petitioner stated that his arrest was effected without any

reasonable cause or material to justify it and that he was detained

unlawfully for three days without being produced before a

Magistrate, in contravention of the procedure set out in the Code

of Criminal Procedure. The Petitioner further stated that he was

subjected to torture and cruel, inhumane, degrading treatment,

including being forced to strip and kneel during interrogation. He

also stated that he was denied food on the night of 28th April 2012.

The Petitioner stated that the failure to identify him at the

identification parade held on 15th May 2012 indicated that there

was no basis to pursue criminal charges against him.

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents denied the allegations made by

the Petitioner and submitted that their actions were at all times

lawful, reasonable and carried out in the course of their official

duties in accordance with the law. They categorically denied the

Petitioners claim that he was arrested and detained by the Special

Task Force (STF) on 28th April 2012. The 1st Respondent stated

8

that the Petitioner surrendered at the Tissamaharama police

station on 30th April 2012, following a statement made by another

suspect, Sugath Ranjan Dissanayake, who had implicated the

Petitioner in the alleged theft of a Valampuri shell. This statement

has been marked as 1R 2(a).

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents further submitted that the

Petitioner was taken into custody only after proper legal procedure

was followed, in accordance with Section 32(1)(b) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Respondents stated that there is no record, written or otherwise,

indicating that the Petitioner was arrested by the Special Task

Force or detained prior to 30th April 2012. The 1st Respondent

specifically stated that he was not present at the police station on

the 28th or 29th of April 2012, as he had been assigned to official

duties at the Senior Superintendent of Police Conference held in

Tangalle on the 28th of April 2012 and at the Sithul Pawwa Temple

on the 29th of April 2012. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents have

submitted affidavits, marked as 1R1, 2R1 and 3R1 to assert their

version of events that took place. In view of these circumstances,

the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents asserted that the Petitioners

account of events lacks any supporting evidence and appears to

have been deliberately fabricated to mislead the Court.

Additionally, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents emphasised that the

Petitioner was produced before a Magistrate without undue delay

and in full compliance with the applicable legal requirements. They

strongly denied any allegation of torture or inhumane treatment

while the Petitioner was in custody.

9

Having considered the above sequences of events as narrated by

the Petitioner and the 1st to 3rd Respondents, I will now consider

the alleged infringement of the Fundamental Rights of the

Petitioner by the 1st to 3rd Respondents.

Legal Analysis

Alleged violation of Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the

Constitution;-

The issues that arise for determination in this application are

whether the Petitioner was subjected to an unlawful arrest by the

1st to 3rd Respondents in violation of Article 13(1) of the

Constitution and whether his continued detention from 28th April

2012 to 1st May 2012 without being produced before a Magistrate

amounted to an infringement of his Fundamental Right under

Article 13(2). It must also be considered whether the Petitioner

was subjected to torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading

treatment or punishment during the period 28th April 2012 to 1st

May 2012 in contrary to Article 11 of the Constitution. Further, it

is necessary to determine whether the actions and omissions of the

1st to 3rd Respondents amounted to violations of the Petitioner's

Fundamental Rights and whether the State bears responsibility for

those violations.

Article 13(1) of the Constitution provides that [n]o person shall be

arrested except according to procedure established by law. Any

person arrested shall be informed of the reason for his arrest. This

provision serves as a cornerstone of the rule of law and due

process, ensuring that executive power is exercised within legal

10

boundaries and not at the whim of individual authority. The

phrase "procedure established by law" implies not only that there

must be a legal basis for the arrest, but also that such procedure

must be fair, reasonable, and just. Any deviation from this

constitutional mandate renders the arrest unlawful and infringes

upon the personal liberty of the individual, which the Constitution

seeks to vigorously protect. Furthermore, the duty to inform the

arrested person of the grounds of arrest is not a mere formality but

a substantive right, aimed at empowering the detainee to challenge

the legality of the detention and to prepare an effective defense.

In this context, credible information becomes the foundational

requirement for any lawful arrest under Article 13(1). The

legitimacy of the procedure established by law hinges on the

presence of trustworthy and verifiable material that gives rise to a

reasonable belief or suspicion of an offence. Without such credible

input, any action taken by law enforcement risks being arbitrary

and in direct violation of the constitutional mandate.

Section 32(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15

of 1979 provides that any peace officer may, without a warrant,

arrest any person who has been concerned in any cognizable

offence, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made,

or credible information has been received, or a reasonable

suspicion exists of such involvement.

In the context of the powers of investigation vested in executive

agencies, G.L. Peiris, Criminal Procedure in Sri Lanka Under

the Administration of Justice Law (1st edn, Lake House

Investments 1979) 35, aptly observed:

11

[T]he primary objectives of the rules applicable to criminal

procedure in this area involve a compromise between efficiency

and restraint. The public interest demands the discovery and

punishment of crime with greater energy and expedition, but

not at the expense of rights which, in fairness to the accused,

are guaranteed from the outset. It is the aim of the law of

procedure to ensure that the liberty of the individual is not

eroded by actions taken during the course of the preliminary

investigation.

This statement highlights the essential balance that must be

maintained between the efficient pursuit of justice and the

safeguarding of individual liberties, emphasising that the

protection of rights of the accused is fundamental throughout all

stages of the criminal investigation.

In this case, the core allegation against the Petitioner arises from

a robbery incident involving two conch shells (Valampuri) valued

at Rs. 3000,000/=. The 1st to 3rd Respondents have submitted that

the Petitioner, allegedly misused his official position as an STF

Officer to participate in this robbery along with another STF officer

(Sub-Inspector Sampath) from the Tangalle STF camp. The B

report (marked as 1R2(a)) filed in the Magistrates Court

Thissamaharama was based on the statement made by Sugath

Dissanayake.

Sugath Dissanayakes statement marked as 1R2(a), revealed that

the Sub- Inspector Sampath had purportedly communicated with

him via mobile phone and informed him that the stolen Valampuri

shells were kept in the possession of the Petitioner (Ruwan

12

Kumara) at the house of the Petitioner. Even though this statement

creates a suspicion it amounts to hearsay evidence. Stolen items

were not recovered and the Petitioner was not identified by the

complainants in the Identification Parade.

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents clarified that they have obtained

a search warrant (marked as P5) under section 68 of the Police

Ordinance No 16 of 1865 in their written submissions, but there

is no further information about the search to prove that the stolen

items were recovered.

Although the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents claimed that the

Petitioner surrendered to the Tissamaharama Police on 30th April

2012 and was subsequently arrested, the factual matrix does not

disclose any independent or voluntary version by the Respondents

concerning the alleged robbery, other than the statement made by

Sugath Dissanayake. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents have not

submitted any contemporaneous investigative material that

substantiates the Petitioners participation in the robbery.

Section 32(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15

of 1979 permits arrest without a warrant where credible

information has been received or where reasonable suspicion

exists regarding a persons involvement in a cognizable offence.

However, it is trite law that such suspicion must be grounded in

specific, verifiable facts. In the present case, the police have acted

based only on Sugath Dissanayakes statement, but no other

material corroboration in order to have reasonable suspicion. Lack

of supporting evidence and credibility does not create a reasonable

suspicion.

13

Therefore, in analysing whether the arrest and continued

detention of the Petitioner were justified, it becomes necessary to

evaluate not only the existence of a complaint or statement but

also whether such information was sufficiently credible and

objectively verified to warrant the deprivation of liberty. In the

absence of such verification, the justification for the arrest

becomes legally questionable, and the claim of violation under

Articles 13(1) of the Constitution.

In Mahanama Tilakaratne v Bandula Wickremasinghe,

Senior Superintendent of Police and Others [1999] 1 Sri L.R.

at page 382, Dheeraratne J stated,

Issuing a warrant is a judicial act involving the liberty of

an individual and no warrant of arrest should be lightly issued

by a Magistrate simply because a prosecutor or an investigator

thinks it is necessary. It must be issued as the law requires,

when a Magistrate is satisfied that he should do so, on the

evidence taken before him on oath. It must not be issued by a

Magistrate to satisfy the sardonic pleasure of an opinionated

investigator or a prosecutor.

In Ven. Dharmaratana Thero and Another v Sanjeewa

Mahanama and Others [2013] 1 Sri L.R. 81 at page 89 Dep J(as

he then was) stated,

[I]n order to arrest a person under this subsection there should

be a reasonable complaint, credible information or a

reasonable suspicion. Mere fact of receiving a complaint or

information does not permit a peace officer to arrest a person.

Police Officer upon receipt of a complaint or information is

14

required to commence investigations and ascertain whether

the complaint is a reasonable complaint, the information is

credible, or the suspicion is reasonable before proceeding to

arrest a person.

Kulatunga, J in Dissanayaka v Superintendent Mahara Prison

and others [1991] (2) SLR 247, 248-249 stated the following to

highlight the importance of examining the material to decide the

validity of the arrest.

Nevertheless, it is for the Court to determine the validity of the

arrest objectively. The Court will not surrender its judgement to

the executive for if it did so, the fundamental right to freedom

from arbitrary arrest secured by Article 13(1) of the Constitution

will be defeated. The executive must place sufficient material

before the Court to enable the Court to make a decision, such as

the notes of investigation, including the statements of witnesses,

observations etc. without relying on bare statements in

affidavits".

Accordingly, although the 1st to 3rd Respondents relied on Section

32(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979,

which permits arrest without a warrant based on credible

information or reasonable suspicion, the lack of objectively

verifiable facts raises serious concerns as to whether that legal

threshold was in fact satisfied in this case. Where the suspicion is

based solely on the confession of a third party, untested by

independent corroboration, the legality of the arrest becomes

questionable in light of the constitutional safeguards guaranteed

under Article 13(1).

15

Having established the foundational principles of lawful arrest

under Article 13(1), it is important to examine how Article 13(2)

further reinforces these protections by addressing the broader

issue of detention following an arrest. While Article 13(1) focuses

on the legality and transparency of the arrest process itself, Article

13(2) shifts the focus to the continued deprivation of liberty,

ensuring that individuals who are detained are not held

indefinitely or without judicial oversight. In other words, Article

13(2) complements Article 13(1) by providing an essential

safeguard against prolonged or unlawful detention. It requires that

any person held in custody or otherwise deprived of liberty must

be promptly brought before a judge, in accordance with the

procedures established by law. This judicial intervention serves to

ensure that detention is not only lawful but also justified,

preventing arbitrary or abusive practices by the authorities.

While the Petitioner was formally arrested on 30th April 2012, the

period between 28th April and 30th April remains significant. The

law prohibits the detention of a suspect for purposes of questioning

or investigative convenience without judicial authorisation,

particularly beyond the twenty-four-hour limit prescribed by law.

This requirement arises from the interplay between the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the Police

Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, which collectively establish the

procedural safeguards for arrest and detention.

Section 37 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979 stipulates:

16

No peace officer shall detain in custody a person arrested

without a warrant for a longer period than under all the

circumstances of the case is reasonable, and such period

shall not exceed twenty-four hours exclusive of the time

necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the

Magistrate.

Correspondingly, Section 65 of the Police Ordinance No. 16 of

1865 provides:

Every person taken into custody by any police officer

without warrant (except persons detained for the mere

purpose of ascertaining their name and residence) shall

forthwith be delivered into the custody of the officer in charge

of a station in order that such person may be secured until he

can be brought before a Magistrate to be dealt with according

to law, or may give bail for his appearance before a

Magistrate, if the officer in charge shall deem it prudent to

take bail as hereinafter mentioned:

Provided that where bail is not taken, the prisoner shall be

brought before a Magistrate within twenty-four hours, unless

circumstances render delay unavoidable.

These provisions collectively ensure that the deprivation of liberty

is subject to timely judicial oversight, thereby preventing arbitrary

or prolonged detention without lawful justification.

Therefore, although proper judicial procedures appear to have

been followed from 30th April onwards, the failure to demonstrate

lawful detention and prompt judicial production during the

17

preceding two days raises a question whether the Petitioners

fundamental rights under Article 13(2) of the Constitution is

violated.

It is evident from the contents of the affidavits placed before this

Court. According to the affidavit filed by the 5th Respondent, he

admitted the contents of paragraph 5 of the Petition. The 5th

Respondent acknowledged that the Petitioner was handed over to

the Tissamaharama Police by the Officer-in-Charge of the Tangalle

STF Camp in connection with the alleged criminal offence. The

notes made by the Officer who effected the handover are marked

as 5R1 and 5R2.

According to document 5R2, it is recorded that:

-2012.04.28..

. . , .. 16085,

. .

.

Furthermore, the 5th Respondent admitted that the Petitioner was

handed over to the Tissamaharama Police on 28th April 2012.

The 1st Respondent, in his affidavit, stated that he was not present

at the Tissamaharama Police Station on 28th April 2012 due to

attending the SSP Conference in Tangalle, but no proof has been

given to support this claim. Crucially, the 5th Respondent admitted

that the Petitioner was handed over to the Tissamaharama Police

18

on that date by STF officers, as proved by documents(IB Extracts

dated 28th April 2012) 5R1 and 5R2. Thus, regardless of the 1st

Respondents presence or absence, the available material clearly

confirms that the Petitioner was in police custody from 28th April

2012.

The affidavit of Dasun Sanjeewa (marked P3) and the affidavits of

Mery Nimal and Mery Sampath Kumara (marked P-02A and P-

02B), that the Petitioner was in fact in police custody from at least

28th April 2012. According to these affidavits, the Petitioner was

handed over to the Tissamaharama Police by STF officers on 28th

April 2012 and was continuously held thereafter. Specifically,

Dasun Sanjeewa averred:

2012.04.29

...

2012.04.30 . 9.00

This establishes that the Petitioner was already in custody by 29th

April, prior to the alleged formal arrest on 30th April 2012.

Additionally, both Mery Nimal and Mery Sampath Kumara averred

that:

2012.04.28

and

19

2012.04.29

The above mentioned Affidavits corroborated that the Petitioner

was detained in the Police station from 28th April to the 1st of May

2012.

Based on the evidence presented, it is clear that the Petitioner was

in police custody from 28th April 2012, even though his formal

arrest was recorded only on 30th April 2012. The affidavits filed by

the 5th Respondent and other witnesses, along with documents

marked 5R1 and 5R2, confirm that the Petitioner was handed over

to the Tissamaharama Police on 28th April and remained in

custody afterward. However, the Respondents have failed to

establish that the Petitioner was brought before a Magistrate or

lawfully detained during this period.

In Senaratne v Punya De Silva and others [1995] 1 Sri L.R. at

page 296 Amarasinghe J observed that

In Mahinda Rajapakse and Vasudeva Nanayakkara v. Chief

Inspector Karunaratne and Others (supra), Bandaranayake, J.

said that Article 13(2) is not concerned with the lawfulness of

the arrest but with the question of ensuring the containment

of executive power. His Lordship said that in considering

Article 13(2), No distinction ought to be drawn between lawful

and unlawful custody, detention or deprivation of liberty in

considering this Article ... The need for such an enquiry should

not be read into this Article. This Article is not concerned with

this. The Article is plain enough and provides that executive

20

detention cannot extend beyond 24 hours without judicial

intervention. The twenty-four hour period is the maximum

period (exclusive of the time necessary for the journey from

place of arrest to the Magistrate) permitted by section 37 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure in the case of an arrest without a

warrant. It cannot, as Bandaranayake, J. said, extend

beyond 24 hours without judicial intervention. However, the

fact that a person is in such a case produced before a

Magistrate within twenty-four hours does not necessarily

satisfy the constitutional requirement prescribed in Article

13(2). Article 13(2) of the Constitution provides, among other

things, that Every person held in custody, detained or

otherwise deprived of personal liberty shall be brought before

the judge of the nearest competent court according to procedure

established by law.

Despite the 1st,2nd and 3rd Respondents' contention that the formal

arrest occurred on 30th April 2012, the undisputed evidence

demonstrates that the Petitioners liberty was curtailed before that

date. There is no B Report, judicial warrant, or procedural record

authorising such detention from 28th to 30th April.

The law does not permit a suspect to be held for investigative

convenience without judicial intervention, especially beyond 24

hours. The detention during this period lacked judicial oversight,

was not supported by statutory authority, and was clearly outside

the procedural safeguards provided by both the Criminal

Procedure Code and the Police Ordinance.

21

The Petitioner was subjected to continued detention without being

produced before a Magistrate within the time prescribed by law,

constituting a breach of these rights.

Accordingly, I find that the Petitioner was subjected to arbitrary

arrest and unlawful detention from 28th to 30th April 2012, in

violation of Article 13(1) and 13(2) of the Constitution.

Alleged Violation of Article 11 of the Constitution:-

Article 11 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic

of Sri Lanka of 1978 No person shall be subjected to torture or to

cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

This provision is absolute and non-derogable and as such, any

claim made under it must be examined with the utmost judicial

seriousness. However, the evidential burden to establish a

violation lies squarely with the Petitioner. In Aranagalle

Samantha v OIC Biyagama and Others [SC (FR) No. 458/2012

SC Minutes of 28.01.2020], Aluwihare J, PC observed that

In proceedings of this nature, the court has very limited

avenues to test the veracity of these assertions and

necessarily have to depend on the affidavits and other

documents filed. In the circumstances, in arriving at a just and

equitable decision in the realm of the fundamental rights

jurisdiction, the court necessarily has to apply the test of

probability to the factual matters placed before us.

In Velmurugu v. Attorney General and another [1981] 1 SLR

406, the Court held that

22

the standard of proof is a preponderance of probabilities as in

a civil case, qualified with the requirement for a high degree of

certainty to tilt in favor of the Petitioner.

Similarly, in Kapugeekiyana v. Hettiarachchi [1984] 2 SLR

153, Wimalaratne J observed:

In deciding whether any particular fundamental right has

been infringed I would apply the test laid down in Velmurugu

that the civil, and not the criminal standard of persuasion

applies, with this observation: that the nature and gravity of

an issue must necessarily determine the manner of attaining

reasonable satisfaction of the truth of that issue.

In applying the above legal standards to the facts in hand, this

Court notes that the Petitioner has, in his Petition, alleged that he

was subjected to torture while in police custody. However, these

allegations remain wholly unsupported by material evidence. The

affidavits marked P-2A and P-2B, sworn by the Petitioners

brothers, contained no reference to any instance or indication of

torture. Instead, they focused on the period and circumstances of

detention. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents have specifically

denied any allegation of torture. Crucially, the affidavit marked P-

3, said to have been made by a fellow detainee (Dasun Sanjeewa),

also did not contain any reference to mistreatment or physical

abuse of the Petitioner.

According to the Affidavits of Mery Nimal and Mery Sampath

Kumara (marked as P-2A and P-2B), they stated,

Further scrutiny is warranted with respect to the affidavit of Dasun

Sanjeewa, who also stated that he was detained at the

Tissamaharama Police Station during the relevant period. His

statement is highly relevant because he claimed to have shared

custody with the Petitioner on the date in question. The relevant

portion of his affidavit stated as follows:

........2012.04.30 . 9.00

.

This statement confirmed that Sanjeewa was detained on the same

date and was released on police bail, but it notably did not include

any mention of torture or inhumane treatment of the Petitioner or

any other detainee. Given the proximity of the affiant to the

24

Petitioners circumstances, the absence of any complaint of

mistreatment in his account substantially weakens the Petitioners

version of events.

Specifically, where it is claimed that the Petitioner was forcibly

stripped naked and made to kneel on the floor. During this time,

the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents allegedly interrogated the

Petitioner for approximately half an hour while he remained in this

humiliating position.

Such acts, if proven, clearly fall within the ambit of cruel,

inhumane, and degrading treatment prohibited under Article 11.

Forcing a person to strip naked and to kneel during interrogation

constitutes a severe affront to human dignity and is unacceptable

under any lawful system of justice.

However, this Court notes the absence of any medical or

independent evidence to corroborate these serious allegations. No

medical reports or expert testimony were presented to substantiate

claims of physical or psychological harm resulting from this

treatment. The marked affidavits (P-3, P2A and P2B) tendered by

the Petitioners family members and others do not support or

reference the occurrence of such treatment.

The burden of proof lies with the Petitioner to establish the

occurrence of torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment.

Mere allegations without supporting material cannot suffice to

establish a breach of constitutional protections under Article 11.

Having carefully considered the above evidence and applicable

legal principles, this Court finds that the Petitioner has not

25

established a violation of Article 11 on a balance of probabilities.

In the absence of even a prima facie allegation of torture in the

supporting affidavits, the Court has no basis to presume the

occurrence of inhumane treatment.

In light of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents clear denial and the

lack of credible, independent corroboration, this Court finds that

the Petitioner has failed to substantiate his claim under Article 11

of the Constitution.

In relation to the 4th Respondent, the only reference to his

involvement appears in the Petitioners version of events.

According to the Petition, the Petitioner states that while he was at

the Tissamaharama Police Station, the 4th Respondent insulted

him and instructed that he be taken to the Crime Branch.

However, there is no independent evidence before this Court to

support this claim. Apart from this uncorroborated allegation,

there is nothing to indicate that the 4th Respondent was involved

in the arrest, detention, or any subsequent action taken against

the Petitioner.

With regard to the involvement of the 5th Respondent, it is evident

that his role was limited and administrative in nature. In his

affidavit he admitted that the Petitioner was handed over to the

Tissamaharama Police by the Officer-in-Charge of the Tangalle STF

Camp on 28th April 2012, in connection with an alleged criminal

offence. This fact is supported by the documents marked 5R1 and

5R2. Apart from this admission, there is no indication that the 5th

Respondent was involved in the arrest, detention, or interrogation

of the Petitioner.

States Liability:-

In addressing the States responsibility in protecting fundamental

rights, Thurairaja, J, PC in Kandawalage Don Samantha Perera

v OIC Hettipola and others [SC (FR) No 296/2014 SC Minutes

of 16.06.2020] emphasised that

............State to ensure that education and information

regarding the prohibition against torture are fully included in

the training of law enforcement personnel, civil or military,

medical personnel, public officials and other persons who may

be involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment of any

individual subjected to any form of arrest, detention or

imprisonment may provide a starting point. As a society that is

committed to protecting the Dignity and Well-being of the People

(See the Preamble/ Svasti of the Constitution), the violation of

the right to liberty guaranteed by Articles 11 and 13 of the

Constitution should be of serious concern and in my view, the

State should take more proactive steps to address the gap

between the law and practice.

This observation underscores the imperative for the State not only

to ensure compliance with constitutional safeguards but also to

actively educate and train all relevant officials to prevent

violations, thereby reinforcing the protection of fundamental rights

and upholding the dignity of every individual.

The violation of the Petitioners fundamental rights under Article

13(2) entails the liability of the State for failing to uphold

constitutional protections regarding personal liberty. It is

27

incumbent upon the State and its authorities to ensure strict

compliance with procedural safeguards, including the timely

production of detainees before a judicial officer. Failure to do so

not only infringe individual rights but also undermines the rule of

law and public confidence in the justice system. The State,

therefore, bears responsibility for the unlawful arrest and

detention, and must take remedial steps to prevent such violations

in the future.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, the Court finds that the

Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 13(1)

and 13(2) of the Constitution have been violated by the acts of the

1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents and the State.

However, no violation of Article 11 has been established against

any of the Respondents, as the Petitioner has not demonstrated,

on a balance of probability, that he was subjected to torture or to

cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment.

Therefore I direct the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents to pay Rs.

250,000/- each as compensation from their personal funds to the

Petitioner and the State to pay a further sum of Rs. 50,000/- as

compensation to the Petitioner.
