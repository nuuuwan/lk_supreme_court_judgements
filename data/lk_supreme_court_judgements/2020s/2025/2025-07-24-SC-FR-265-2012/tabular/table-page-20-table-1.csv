It  cannot,  as  Bandaranayake,  J.  said, 
‘extend"
"beyond 24 hours without judicial  intervention.’ However, the"
"fact 
that  a  person 
is 
in  such  a  case  produced  before  a"
"Magistrate  within 
twenty-four  hours  does  not  necessarily"
"satisfy  the  constitutional  requirement  prescribed 
in  Article"
"13(2).  Article  13(2)  of  the  Constitution  provides,  among  other"
"things, 
that 
‘Every  person  held 
in  custody,  detained  or"
"otherwise deprived of personal liberty shall be brought before"
"the judge of the nearest competent court according to procedure"
"established by law.’ ”"
