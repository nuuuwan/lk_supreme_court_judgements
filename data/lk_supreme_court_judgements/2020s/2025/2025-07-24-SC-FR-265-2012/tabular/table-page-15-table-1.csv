"Having  established  the  foundational  principles  of  lawful  arrest"
"under Article 13(1), it is important to examine how Article 13(2)"
"further  reinforces  these  protections  by  addressing  the  broader"
"issue of detention following an arrest. While Article 13(1) focuses"
"on the legality and transparency of the arrest process itself, Article"
"13(2)  shifts  the  focus  to  the  continued  deprivation  of  liberty,"
"ensuring 
that 
individuals  who 
are  detained 
are  not  held"
"indefinitely  or  without  judicial oversight.  In other words,  Article"
"13(2)  complements  Article  13(1)  by  providing  an  essential"
"safeguard against prolonged or unlawful detention. It requires that"
"any person held in custody or otherwise deprived of liberty must"

in  accordance  with  the"
"procedures established by law. This judicial intervention serves to"
"ensure 
that  detention 
is  not  only 
lawful  but  also 
justified,"
"preventing arbitrary or abusive practices by the authorities."
"While the Petitioner was formally arrested on 30th April 2012, the"
"period between 28th April and 30th April remains significant. The"
"law prohibits the detention of a suspect for purposes of questioning"
"or 
investigative 
convenience  without 
judicial 
authorisation,"
"particularly beyond the twenty-four-hour limit prescribed by law."
"This  requirement  arises  from  the  interplay  between  the  Code  of"
"Criminal  Procedure  Act  No.  15  of  1979  and 
the  Police"
"Ordinance  No.  16  of  1865,  which  collectively  establish  the"
"procedural safeguards for arrest and detention."
"Section  37  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  Act  No.  15  of"
"1979 stipulates:"
