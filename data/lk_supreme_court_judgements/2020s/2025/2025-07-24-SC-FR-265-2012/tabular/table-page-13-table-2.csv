"at page 382, Dheeraratne J stated,"
"“Issuing a warrant is a judicial act involving the liberty of"
"an individual and no warrant of arrest should be lightly issued"
"by a Magistrate simply because a prosecutor or an investigator"
"thinks it is necessary. It must be issued as the law requires,"
"when  a  Magistrate  is  satisfied  that  he  should  do  so,  on  the"
"evidence taken before him on oath. It must not be issued by a"
"Magistrate to satisfy the sardonic pleasure of an opinionated"
"investigator or a prosecutor.”"
