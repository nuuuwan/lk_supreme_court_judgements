"Therefore, 
in 
analysing  whether 
the 
arrest 
and 
continued"
"detention of the Petitioner were justified, it becomes necessary to"
"evaluate  not  only  the  existence  of  a  complaint  or  statement  but"
"also  whether  such 
information  was  sufficiently  credible  and"
"objectively  verified  to  warrant  the  deprivation  of  liberty.  In  the"
"absence  of  such  verification, 
the 
justification 
for 
the  arrest"
"becomes  legally  questionable,  and  the  claim  of  violation  under"
"Articles 13(1) of the Constitution."
