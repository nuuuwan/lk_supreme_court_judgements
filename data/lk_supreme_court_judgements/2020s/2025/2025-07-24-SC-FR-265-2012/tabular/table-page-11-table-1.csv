"“[T]he  primary  objectives  of  the  rules  applicable  to  criminal"
"procedure in this area involve a compromise between efficiency"
"and restraint. The public interest demands the discovery and"
"punishment  of  crime  with  greater  energy  and  expedition,  but"
"not at the expense of rights which, in fairness to the accused,"
"are  guaranteed  from  the  outset.  It  is  the  aim  of  the  law  of"
"procedure  to  ensure  that  the  liberty  of  the  individual  is  not"
"eroded  by  actions  taken  during  the  course  of  the  preliminary"
"investigation.”"
