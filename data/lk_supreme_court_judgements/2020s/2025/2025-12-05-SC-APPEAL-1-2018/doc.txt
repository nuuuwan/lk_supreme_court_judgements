Introduction

The plaintiff filed this action naming ten defendants as parties, seeking

partition of the land known as Danwatte Kumbura alias Danatte Kumbura

alias Ratmehera Danatte Liyadde Kumbura among the plaintiff and the 1ˢᵗ

to 10ᵗʰ defendants. The number of defendants was later increased to thirty

two. The Preliminary Plan No. 2286 consists of four Lots, namely Lots A to

D.

After trial, the learned District Judge excluded Lots B and C and confined

the land to be partitioned to Lots A and D, which was partitioned among

the plaintiff and the 1ˢᵗ to 10ᵗʰ defendants. In the judgment, the learned

District Judge varied the allocation of shares slightly from what was set out

in the plaint.

Being dissatisfied with the exclusion of Lots B and C from the corpus, the

plaintiff preferred an appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal, which

dismissed the appeal. Hence, this appeal to this Court.

Exclusion of lot B

The 15ᵗʰ defendant filed a statement of claim asserting that Lot B in the

Preliminary Plan was a different land known as Duwe Addara Kumbure

Kebella. He claimed title to Lot B on the basis of several deeds, which were

produced at the trial marked 15D1 to 15D11. According to those deeds,

Duwe Addara Kumbura is a land in extent of one Amunam of paddy-sowing

area. Learned Counsel for the 15ᵗʰ defendant accepted that one Amunam of

paddy-sowing area is equivalent to 400 perches. However, the extent of Lot

B is only 36 perches.

The 15ᵗʰ defendant died pending the action, and his children have not taken

steps to substitute themselves to proceed with the case. The 15(a)

7

SC/APPEAL/1/2018

defendant, a relation of the 15ᵗʰ defendant, gave evidence at the trial but

failed to explain the discrepancy in extent.

In addition, the boundaries described in the deeds do not tally with those

of Lot B in the Preliminary Plan, and the 15(a) defendant has not offered

any explanation for this inconsistency either. Notably, the southern

boundary of Lot B is the main road, whereas the 15ᵗʰ defendant’s deeds do

not indicate a road as the southern boundary.

From the evidence of the 15(a) defendant, it is also clear that he was not in

possession of Lot B.

According to the report on the Preliminary Plan, the deceased 15ᵗʰ defendant

claimed title to Lot B and its improvements based on Plan No. 1045 dated

23.09.1926. However, that Plan was not produced either to the surveyor or

at any stage of the proceedings. The Court may properly draw the

presumption that it was not produced because it was unfavourable to the

15ᵗʰ defendant’s case.

In excluding Lot B in favour of the 15ᵗʰ defendant, the learned District Judge

relied heavily on Plan No. 2948 prepared for another partition action (DC

Galle Case No. 21054) marked P3, and its judgment marked P4. That Plan

had been prepared in 1865. The learned District Judge concluded that Lot

B in the Preliminary Plan and Lot A in Plan No. 2948 were the same, and

that according to the report to the said Plan, Lot A had been claimed by

Wattuhamy and Simon as a land known as Ratmehera Doowa Addara

Kumbura, through whom the 15ᵗʰ defendant claimed title.

Although the report to Plan No. 2948 states that Lot A had been claimed by

Wattuhamy and Simon as Ratmehera Doowa Addara Kumbura, there is

nothing in the judgment to indicate that the Court accepted that position.

According to the judgment, that partition action was dismissed.

8

SC/APPEAL/1/2018

Considering the situation and extent of Lot B, it is unlikely that Lot B

constitutes a separate land. By its appearance and location, it forms part of

the land to be partitioned.

Seeking exclusion of Lot B on the basis of prescription, while treating it as

part of the corpus, is one thing; seeking exclusion of it on the footing that

it is a different land altogether is quite another.

On the facts and circumstances of this case, I am not persuaded that there

was sufficient evidence to exclude Lot B as a different land, or to hold that

it had been acquired by the 15ᵗʰ defendant by prescription.

Exclusion of lot C

The 5ᵗʰ and 16ᵗʰ to 19ᵗʰ defendants sought exclusion of Lot C of the

Preliminary Plan No. 2286. At the argument before this Court, only the 5ᵗʰ

and 17ᵗʰ defendants were represented by Mr. Sahabandu, P.C. They sought

exclusion of Lot C on the basis that it is a different land known as

Ketakalagahawatta.

The 5ᵗʰ defendant filed a separate statement of claim, while the 16ᵗʰ to 19ᵗʰ

defendants filed another. The 5ᵗʰ defendant comes within the plaintiff’s

pedigree and is therefore a co-owner. In the plaint, the plaintiff has

apportioned an undivided 12/240 share to the 5ᵗʰ defendant.

The 5ᵗʰ defendant marked six deeds (5D1 to 5D6) in his evidence. Learned

President’s Counsel for the 5ᵗʰ defendant before this Court stated that only

5D1 and 5D2 relate to the land sought to be partitioned, while the

remaining deeds are irrelevant. Although the 5ᵗʰ and 16ᵗʰ to 19ᵗʰ defendants

took up the position before the District Court and the High Court that Lot

C is a different land known as Ketakalagahawatta, learned President’s

Counsel for the 5ᵗʰ and 17ᵗʰ defendants submitted before us that Lot C is

also part of the land sought to be partitioned, namely Danwatte Kumbura

9

SC/APPEAL/1/2018

alias Danatte Kumbura alias Ratmehera Danatte Liyadde Kumbura, and

that exclusion is now sought only on the basis of prescription.

The inconsistency in the positions taken before different Courts clearly

undermines the credibility and strength of their claim.

The 5ᵗʰ defendant, being a co-owner, cannot successfully claim prescriptive

title to a portion of the land unless there is strong and convincing evidence

establishing prescription. No such evidence has been adduced in this case.

The mere claim made before the surveyor with respect to cultivation is

insufficient to discharge that burden. I hold that the claim of prescriptive

title to Lot C by the 5ᵗʰ defendant cannot succeed.

According to the plaintiff’s calculation, the 5ᵗʰ defendant is entitled to an

undivided 12/240 share. However, the learned District Judge, in the

judgment, has allotted an undivided 14/240 share to him. The plaintiff does

not dispute that finding.

The 16ᵗʰ to 19ᵗʰ defendants did not give evidence or produce any deeds. On

behalf of the 16ᵗʰ defendant, a surveyor was called to give evidence. The 17ᵗʰ

defendant did not even appear before the surveyor as a claimant. There is,

therefore, no basis for any claim advanced by the 17ᵗʰ defendant.

I am accordingly of the view that Lot C forms part of the corpus and cannot

be excluded either as a different land or on the basis of prescriptive

possession by any of the parties.

Conclusion

A previous Bench of this Court has granted leave to appeal on several

questions of law. The first of them reads as follows:

Did the High Court of Civil Appeal misdirect itself in holding that the

learned District Judge had correctly analysed the evidence pertaining

10

SC/APPEAL/1/2018

to the exclusion of Lots B and C from the corpus, on the basis that the

15ᵗʰ, 5ᵗʰ, and 16ᵗʰ to 19ᵗʰ defendants had clearly established that the

said two lots were respectively Duwe Addara Kumbura and

Ketakalagahawatta?

I answer that question of law in the affirmative. In view of that finding, it is

unnecessary to consider the remaining questions of law, as they are

peripheral and arise within the ambit of the above question.

I hold that Lots B and C of the Preliminary Plan cannot be excluded from

the land to be partitioned. Lots A to D together form the corpus, and the

corpus shall be divided among the parties in the manner determined by the

learned District Judge.

Accordingly, the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal is set aside, and

the judgment of the District Court is affirmed, subject to the modification

that Lots A to D of the Preliminary Plan No. 2286 shall form part of the

corpus.
