"possession of the property, and therefore, he acquired prescriptive title to it."
"The defendant has relied on deed No. 3482 dated 15-09-1992 marked V-02,"
"to assert that the said Yehiya gifted the property to her and she also has a"
"deed of declaration in that regard in the form of deed No. 3477 dated 04-09-"
"1992 marked V-03. She has claimed prescriptive title for the property based"
"on the above deeds, as well as her possession from 1992."
"Accordingly,  the  learned  District  Judge  has  looked  into  the  evidence  led  in"
"order to find out whether there is evidence on the balance of probability that"
"the  defendant’s  alleged  predecessor 
in  title,  namely  Yehiya,  has 
in 
fact"
"acquired prescriptive title to the property. In this process, the learned District"
"Judge has looked whether there was evidence before the  Court to conclude"
"that  he  has  possessed  the  property  as  against  the  property  rights  of  the"
"plaintiff and her predecessors in title."
"Having  considered  the  evidence  placed  before  the  trial  Court,  the  learned"
"District  Judge  has  correctly  come 
to  a  conclusion 
that 
the  claimed"
"predecessor in title of the defendant, namely Yehiya, had lived in the property,"
"but he had lived there only under the tenancy rights of the mother of both the"
"plaintiff and the defendant. It has also been determined that the documentary"
"evidence  tendered  by  both  parties  at  the  trial,  has  established  that  the"
"mentioned Yehiya had been living in a separate address during 1990, 1991"
"and 1992. Even the defendant herself has admitted that during the time the"
"deed of declaration was executed, Yehiya was not living in the property."
"The 
learned  District  Judge  has  also  considered 
the  admission  by 
the"
"defendant in her evidence given on 01-06-2008 that it was Mohammed Ismail,"
"the  plaintiff’s  predecessor  of  title,  who  owned  the  property.  The  fact  of  the"
"defendant’s admission that their mother was the tenant of the property and"
"their uncle Yehiya under whom the defendant is claiming prescription to the"
"property  lived  under  the  tenancy  of  their  mother  has  also  been  considered"
"relevant. It has also been considered the fact that the claimed predecessor of"
"the  title  of  the  defendant,  namely,  Yehiya’s 
failure  to  substantiate  the"
"prescriptive rights of the defendant as relevant as well."
