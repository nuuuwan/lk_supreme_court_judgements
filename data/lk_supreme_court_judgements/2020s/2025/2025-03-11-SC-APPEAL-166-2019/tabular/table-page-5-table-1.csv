"mother was the tenant of the property and upon her death, she succeeded to"
"the tenancy of the premises before she became the owner of the property."
"She has also pleaded that her sister, who is the defendant of this action, and"
"one  of  their  uncles,  named,  Fuard  Thuan  Yehiya,  was  also  living  in  the"
"property under the tenancy of their mother. It had been her position that after"

"acquired prescriptive title to the property and he transferred his rights to her,"
"and therefore, the plaintiff or her claimed predecessors in title never had any"
