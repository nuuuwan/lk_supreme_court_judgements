"a primary fact that needs to be established to take up an issue of this nature."
"None of the deeds produced by either party has mentioned a value more than"
"Rs. 100,000/-. Hence, I find no basis to presume as to the value of the estate"
"of the deceased person."
"I find that the learned judges of the Provincial High Court of Western Province"
"holden in Colombo while exercising the civil appellate jurisdiction has taken"
"up the argument raised on behalf of the defendant for the 1st time in appeal"
"without  considering  whether  such  an  argument  can  be  raised  in  such  a"
"manner, without it being taken up before the trial Court."
"It is clear that for such a ground of appeal to qualify for the 1st time in appeal,"
"there must be clear evidence before the trial Court to show that the estate of"
"the deceased person had a value of Rs. 500,000/- or more. There was no such"
"evidence as there was no such issue. It is clear that the said question is not"
"a pure question of law, but a question that needs consideration of facts for a"
"determination.  Hence,  I  am  in  full  agreement  with  the  contention  that  the"
"learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden"
"in Colombo while exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction were erred in law"
"when deciding the appeal preferred by the defendant on such a basis."
"The next matter that needs to be considered is whether there was a basis to"
"hold that the plaintiff has failed to establish her title to the property in suit."
"As I have considered in detail previously, it is the considered view of this Court"
"that in fact, the plaintiff has proved her title to the property, and once the title"
"is  proved,  the  right  to  possess  is  presumed,  and  the  burden  shifts  to  the"
"defendant  who  claims  independent  rights  to  the  property  in  the  form  of"
"prescription to establish that fact as against the rights of the plaintiff to the"
"satisfaction of the Court."
"I find no basis to conclude that the title pleaded by the plaintiff was not clear"
"as determined by the learned High Court Judges of the Provincial High Court"
"of the Western Province holden in Colombo while exercising the civil appellate"
"jurisdiction. On the contrary, I find that the plaintiffâ€™s title has been proved to"
"the satisfaction of the trial Court."
