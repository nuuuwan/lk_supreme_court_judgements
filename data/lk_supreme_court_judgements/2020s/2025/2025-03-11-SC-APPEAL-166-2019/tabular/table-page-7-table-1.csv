"accordingly,  his  widow  Useiya  Ismail  and  daughter  Farzana  have  become"
"owners of the said property."
"They have also executed the deed of declaration  No. 749 dated 16-03-1999"
"(the  deed  marked  P-03)  to  assert  their  rights.  Subsequently,  they  have"
"transferred their rights to the property by deed No. 912 dated 21-06-2001 to"
"the  plaintiff  (deed  marked  P-04),  and  thereby,  the  plaintiff  has  become  the"
"owner of the property."
"As correctly observed by the  learned District Judge,  none of the above title"
"deeds have been disputed at the trial, and therefore, the said documents can"
"be accepted without further proof. The Notary Public, who attested the deeds"
"marked P-03 and P-04, has also given evidence at the trial."
"The  learned  District  Judge  in  the  process  of  evaluating  evidence  has  well"
"considered the claim that one of the plaintiffs’ predecessors in title, namely,"
"Mohammed Ismail, has in fact transferred his right to his father and the said"
"father has transferred it to one of his other brothers in 1959, in order to find"
"out  whether  it  has  any  effect  on  the  title  of  the  plaintiff.  The  evidence  led"
"before  the  trial  Court  has  clearly  established  that  the  mentioned  brother,"
"namely Mohideed Sadoon, has in fact instituted an action before the District"
"Court claiming that he is only holding the property in question on trust on"
"behalf of his brother Mohammed Ismail, which establishes that upon Ismail’s"
"death,  the  property  had  been  inherited  by  his  wife  and  daughter,  who  has"
"then transferred the said property to the plaintiff."
"It is therefore abundantly clear that the plaintiff has proven her paper title to"
"the property under litigation as pleaded by her in the plaint. The identity of"
"the property had never been in dispute."
