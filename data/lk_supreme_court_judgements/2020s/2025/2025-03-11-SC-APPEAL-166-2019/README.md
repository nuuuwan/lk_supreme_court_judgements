The plaintiff-respondent-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the plaintiff) filed

this appeal on the basis of being aggrieved by the judgment dated 06-06-2016,

pronounced by the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in

Colombo exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction.

From the impugned judgment, the judgment pronounced by the learned

District Judge of Colombo on 04-12-2009, where a judgment was pronounced

in favour of the appellant was set aside. While allowing the appeal preferred

by the defendant-appellant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

defendant), the action of the appellant initiated before the District Court of

Colombo was dismissed.

Page 4 of 14

When the application for leave to appeal from the impugned judgment was

considered before this Court, leave to appeal was granted on 14-10-2019,

based on sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph 9 of the petition dated 11-

07-2016.

The said grounds of appeal read thus;

(i) Have the learned High Court Judges erred in law in holding that

the petitioner had failed to establish her title to the property in

suit.

(ii) Have the learned High Court Judges erred in law in holding that

the provisions of section 545 of the Civil Procedure Code apply to

the estate of the said Mohammed Ismail, and hence, the plaintiff

has not become the owner of the said property by the said deed

of transfer No. 912, as the said transfer effected by the said

daughter and the widow of the said Mohammed Ismail without

obtaining the letters of administration in respect of the estate of

the said Ismail.

At the hearing of the appeal, this Court had the advantage of listening to the

submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel who represented the

appellant, as well as the learned Counsel who represented the defendant, and

also the written submissions tendered by both parties as to their respective

stands.

This is a matter where the appellant initiated proceedings before the District

Court of Colombo in the form of a vindicatory suit, praying for a declaration

of title for the property mentioned in the 1st schedule of the plaint, and also

for an order to eject the defendant from the property morefully described in

the 2nd schedule of the plaint, which is a portion of the property mentioned in

the 1st schedule.

The case for the plaintiff had been that she became the owner of the property

as per the chain of title pleaded in the plaint. It has also been stated that her

Page 5 of 14

mother was the tenant of the property and upon her death, she succeeded to

the tenancy of the premises before she became the owner of the property.

She has also pleaded that her sister, who is the defendant of this action, and

one of their uncles, named, Fuard Thuan Yehiya, was also living in the

property under the tenancy of their mother. It had been her position that after

she became the owner of the property, she demanded the defendant to vacate

the property, and notwithstanding the said demand, the defendant kept on

occupying the portion of the land morefully described in the 2nd schedule of

the plaint. It was on that basis she has pleaded for the reliefs as prayed in the

plaint.

The position taken up by the defendant in her answer had been that neither

their mother nor their grandmother had occupied this property as a tenant of

the original owners, and the property was owned by their uncle, the earlier

mentioned Thuan Yehiya, by long and uninterrupted prescriptive possession.

She has claimed that the said Yehiya, who became the owner of the property

through prescription, gifted the same to her by way of the deed pleaded in her

answer, and she is now the owner of the property.

In her answer, she has also pleaded that the claimed original owner as stated

by the plaintiff, namely Mohammed Mohideen Mohammed Ismail, had no

rights to the property as the said property was transferred to his father by

him, and thereafter, the said father has transferred the property to one of his

other sons on 10-11-1959 by the deed No. 868. Accordingly, she has pleaded

for the dismissal of the plaintiffs action and to give her the possession of the

property claimed by the plaintiff, as well as several other reliefs as prayed for

in her answer.

However, when the matter was taken up for trial, it appears from the issues

raised by the defendant that she has mainly relied on her claim that her uncle

acquired prescriptive title to the property and he transferred his rights to her,

and therefore, the plaintiff or her claimed predecessors in title never had any

title to the property. Her issues have been on the basis that it is she who

Page 6 of 14

acquired prescriptive title to the property based on her uncles gift, as well as

her possession of the property.

It is quite clear from the evidence led before the trial Court that although the

plaintiff has been questioned as to her predecessors in title on the basis that

Mohammed Mohideen Mohammed Ismail did not have title for his wife and

daughter to inherit the property upon his death, as he has transferred his

right to his father, and thereafter, his father has transferred his right to one

of his other sons, it needs to be noted that, it was never an issue raised before

the District Court. It appears that the plaintiff has led evidence to counter the

position taken up in the answer of the defendant, although it was not an issue

taken up before the trial Court.

It is well settled law that once the issues are settled before a trial Court, the

pleadings recede to the background, and it is based on the issues raised, that

the matter should be decided by a trial Judge.

It was held in the case of Cellate International Company Vs. Turner Steiner

East Asia Ltd. (S.C. Appeal No. 17/98, SC minute dated 21-06-2001,

BASL Newsletter October 2001 page 05) that although in an answer, there

is a denial of a particular matter pleaded in plaint, unless that matter is put

in issue at the trial, such denial is deemed to have been waived.

It was also held in the case of Dharmasiri Vs. Wickramathunge (2002) 2

SLR 2018 that, once issues are framed and accepted, pleadings recede to the

background.

It is quite apparent from the judgment of the learned District Judge that the

matter has been decided purely on the issues raised before the Court to be

determined, and not based on other extraneous matters that need not be

considered in the judgment.

It has been determined that the original owners of the land, namely

Mohammed Mohideen, Mohammed Ismail, Mohammed Kaleed and

Mohammed Naheem, gifted the property by the deed No. 552 dated 09-03-

1931 to Mohammed Ismail (deed marked P-01). The said Mohammed Ismail

has died without leaving an estate which needs administration, and

Page 7 of 14

accordingly, his widow Useiya Ismail and daughter Farzana have become

owners of the said property.

They have also executed the deed of declaration No. 749 dated 16-03-1999

(the deed marked P-03) to assert their rights. Subsequently, they have

transferred their rights to the property by deed No. 912 dated 21-06-2001 to

the plaintiff (deed marked P-04), and thereby, the plaintiff has become the

owner of the property.

As correctly observed by the learned District Judge, none of the above title

deeds have been disputed at the trial, and therefore, the said documents can

be accepted without further proof. The Notary Public, who attested the deeds

marked P-03 and P-04, has also given evidence at the trial.

The learned District Judge in the process of evaluating evidence has well

considered the claim that one of the plaintiffs predecessors in title, namely,

Mohammed Ismail, has in fact transferred his right to his father and the said

father has transferred it to one of his other brothers in 1959, in order to find

out whether it has any effect on the title of the plaintiff. The evidence led

before the trial Court has clearly established that the mentioned brother,

namely Mohideed Sadoon, has in fact instituted an action before the District

Court claiming that he is only holding the property in question on trust on

behalf of his brother Mohammed Ismail, which establishes that upon Ismails

death, the property had been inherited by his wife and daughter, who has

then transferred the said property to the plaintiff.

It is therefore abundantly clear that the plaintiff has proven her paper title to

the property under litigation as pleaded by her in the plaint. The identity of

the property had never been in dispute.

In the case of Luwis Singho and Others Vs. Ponnamperuma (1996) 2 SLR

320, it was held;

Actions for declaration of title and ejectment (as in this case) and

vindicatory actions are brought for the same purpose of recovery of

property. In Rei Vindicatio action, the course of action is based on the sole

Page 8 of 14

ground of the violation of the right of ownership and in such an action

proof is required that,

1. The plaintiff is the owner of the land in question i.e. he has the

dominium and,

2. That the land is in the possession of the defendant.

Even if an owner never had possession, it would not be a bar to a

vindicatory action.

In the case of Leisa and Another Vs. Simon and Another (2002) 1 SLR 148,

the plaintiff-appellants instituted an action seeking a declaration of title and

ejectment of the defendants from the premises in question. The defendants

claimed prescriptive rights. The plaintiffs action was dismissed.

On appeal, it was held:

1. The contest is between the right of dominium of the plaintiffs

and the declaration of adverse possession amounting to

prescription by the defendants.

2. The moment the title is proved the right to possess it is

presumed.

3. For the Court to have come to its decision as to whether the

plaintiff had dominium the proving of paper title is sufficient.

4. Once the paper title becomes undisputed, the burden shifts to

the defendant to show that they had independent rights in the

form of prescription as claimed by them.

It is clear from the judgment of the learned District Judge that after having

satisfied that the appellant has proved her title to the property in question,

his attention has been shifted to consider whether the defendant has proved

the prescription she has claimed for the same property to the satisfaction of

the Court.

Her prescriptive title has been primarily based on the claimed prescriptive

title of her uncle Yehiya, who has admittedly lived in the same property while

the plaintiffs mother was the tenant of the property. The defendants claim

has been that it was Yehiya who had uninterrupted and undisturbed

Page 9 of 14

possession of the property, and therefore, he acquired prescriptive title to it.

The defendant has relied on deed No. 3482 dated 15-09-1992 marked V-02,

to assert that the said Yehiya gifted the property to her and she also has a

deed of declaration in that regard in the form of deed No. 3477 dated 04-09-

1992 marked V-03. She has claimed prescriptive title for the property based

on the above deeds, as well as her possession from 1992.

Accordingly, the learned District Judge has looked into the evidence led in

order to find out whether there is evidence on the balance of probability that

the defendants alleged predecessor in title, namely Yehiya, has in fact

acquired prescriptive title to the property. In this process, the learned District

Judge has looked whether there was evidence before the Court to conclude

that he has possessed the property as against the property rights of the

plaintiff and her predecessors in title.

Having considered the evidence placed before the trial Court, the learned

District Judge has correctly come to a conclusion that the claimed

predecessor in title of the defendant, namely Yehiya, had lived in the property,

but he had lived there only under the tenancy rights of the mother of both the

plaintiff and the defendant. It has also been determined that the documentary

evidence tendered by both parties at the trial, has established that the

mentioned Yehiya had been living in a separate address during 1990, 1991

and 1992. Even the defendant herself has admitted that during the time the

deed of declaration was executed, Yehiya was not living in the property.

The learned District Judge has also considered the admission by the

defendant in her evidence given on 01-06-2008 that it was Mohammed Ismail,

the plaintiffs predecessor of title, who owned the property. The fact of the

defendants admission that their mother was the tenant of the property and

their uncle Yehiya under whom the defendant is claiming prescription to the

property lived under the tenancy of their mother has also been considered

relevant. It has also been considered the fact that the claimed predecessor of

the title of the defendant, namely, Yehiyas failure to substantiate the

prescriptive rights of the defendant as relevant as well.

Page 10 of 14

For the matters considered as above, I have no reason to disagree with the

learned District Judge that the defendant has failed to prove her claimed

prescriptive title as against the proved title of the plaintiff, and thereby,

granting reliefs to the plaintiff as sought for in the prayer of the plaint.

When the matter was appealed against to the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province holden in Colombo exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction,

it appears that the learned High Court Judges who pronounced the judgment

has considered matters that were not in the issues settled before the trial

Court.

The fact whether the property upon which this action was based upon is a

property that required administration in terms of section 545 of the Civil

Procedure Code was never at issue during the trial before the District Court.

The learned Counsel who represented the defendant, who was the appellant

before the Provincial High Court of Western Province holden in Colombo

exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction, has taken up this question for the

1st time in his written submissions tendered to the High Court. Therefore, it

is abundantly clear that this was a matter the learned District Judge of

Colombo was never required to address his mind when pronouncing his

judgement.

The said section of the Civil Procedure Code as it stood before the section was

repealed by Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 11 of 2010 and

replaced by a new section, reads as follows;

545. No person shall

a. Maintain any action for the recovery of any property,

b. Effect any transfer of any property,

movable or immovable, in Sri Lanka, belonging to, or

included in, the estate or effects of any person dying testate

or intestate in or out of Sri Lanka within 20 years prior to

Page 11 of 14

the institution of the action or the effecting of the transfer,

unless the grant of probate has been issued in the case of a

person dying testate or letters of administration or

certification of heirships have been issued, in the case of a

person dying intestate and leaving an estate amounting to or

exceeding Rs. 500 000/- in value.

Since the plaintiffs predecessor in title, namely Ufaifa Ismail and Fathima

Farzana Ismail, has transferred their rights to the plaintiff on the basis of

inheritance from Mohammed Mohideen Mohammed Ismail, the argument that

the said Ismail died leaving an estate which requires administration in terms

of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, is a mixed question of facts and

law as correctly pointed out by the learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of

the plaintiff.

It is well settled law that although a pure question of law can be taken up for

the 1st time in an appeal, if the said question is a question of fact and law

combined, such a position cannot be taken up for the 1st time in an appeal.

In the case of Setha Vs. Weerakoon 49 NLR 225, it was held,

A new point which was not raised in the issues or in the course of the

trial cannot be raised for the 1st time in appeal, unless such point might

have been raised at the trial under one of the issues raised, and the Court

of Appeal has before it all the requisite material for deciding the point or

the question is one of law and nothing more.

In the case of H.E.A Jayawickrama and Another Vs. A. David Silva 76 NLR

427, it was determined that,

A pure question of law can be raised in appeal for the 1st time but if it is

a mixed question of fact and law, it cannot be so done. The facts elicited

in the original Court on this point are not sufficient to decide the question

of law raised in appeal.

Page 12 of 14

In the case of Rev. Pallegama Gnanarathana Vs. Rev. Galkiriyaagama

Soratha (1998) 1 SLR 99 at page 121, it was observed,

The Court of Appeal also appears to have taken the view that a custom

whereby the chief priest of a temple could be appointed by the laity is

contrary to the Buddhist ecclesiastical law. Its judgment, however,

contains no exposition of the relevant ecclesiastical law. It has also held

that the contents of the ecclesiastical law on a particular matter is a pure

question of law and, as such, it could be raised in first time in appeal. I

do not agree with the view of the Court of Appeal. As pointed out by the

learned Presidents Counsel what the Buddhist ecclesiastical law on any

matter is has to be established on evidence as a matter of fact. It is not a

pure question of law but of fact and law. Apart from those disputed

questions of Buddhist ecclesiastical law which have already been settled

by judicial decisions, other questions such as the one under consideration

involving as they do questions of fact have to be established in evidence

adduced at the trial like any other fact. As such I hold that the Court of

Appeal erred in permitting the respondent in spite of the objections

thereto, to raise this point for the first time in appeal as a pure question

of law.

Similarly, as pointed out correctly by the learned Presidents Counsel, there

is no basis to consider the said position raised based on the question whether

the estate of the plaintiffs predecessor in title should have been administered

or not, as a pure question of law. For an estate to be administered under the

provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, there must be evidence to show that

the person who died intestate left an estate amounting to or exceeding Rs.

500,000/- in value as per the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code

applicable before the relevant section was repealed and amended.

As this was never an issue before the trial Court, there had been no evidence

placed either by the plaintiff or by the defendant to show that the relevant

estate of the deceased person had a value of Rs. 500,000/- or more, which is

Page 13 of 14

a primary fact that needs to be established to take up an issue of this nature.

None of the deeds produced by either party has mentioned a value more than

Rs. 100,000/-. Hence, I find no basis to presume as to the value of the estate

of the deceased person.

I find that the learned judges of the Provincial High Court of Western Province

holden in Colombo while exercising the civil appellate jurisdiction has taken

up the argument raised on behalf of the defendant for the 1st time in appeal

without considering whether such an argument can be raised in such a

manner, without it being taken up before the trial Court.

It is clear that for such a ground of appeal to qualify for the 1st time in appeal,

there must be clear evidence before the trial Court to show that the estate of

the deceased person had a value of Rs. 500,000/- or more. There was no such

evidence as there was no such issue. It is clear that the said question is not

a pure question of law, but a question that needs consideration of facts for a

determination. Hence, I am in full agreement with the contention that the

learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden

in Colombo while exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction were erred in law

when deciding the appeal preferred by the defendant on such a basis.

The next matter that needs to be considered is whether there was a basis to

hold that the plaintiff has failed to establish her title to the property in suit.

As I have considered in detail previously, it is the considered view of this Court

that in fact, the plaintiff has proved her title to the property, and once the title

is proved, the right to possess is presumed, and the burden shifts to the

defendant who claims independent rights to the property in the form of

prescription to establish that fact as against the rights of the plaintiff to the

satisfaction of the Court.

I find no basis to conclude that the title pleaded by the plaintiff was not clear

as determined by the learned High Court Judges of the Provincial High Court

of the Western Province holden in Colombo while exercising the civil appellate

jurisdiction. On the contrary, I find that the plaintiffs title has been proved to

the satisfaction of the trial Court.

Page 14 of 14

For the reasons as considered above, I answer the two questions of law

considered in the affirmative.

Accordingly, I set aside the appellate judgment pronounced on 06-06-2016 by

the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

holden in Colombo exercising its appellate jurisdiction as it cannot be allowed

to stand, and affirm the judgment dated 04-12-2009 pronounced by the

learned District Judge of Colombo.

The appeal is allowed. There will be no costs of the appeal.
