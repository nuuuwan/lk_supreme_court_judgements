"However, I observe that the Petitioners have chosen not to name any PNB officer as"
"a Respondent and also chosen not to attribute any responsibility to any PNB officer"
"for placing the 2nd Petitioner under arrest inside the PNB premises itself. Although the"
"2nd Petitioner has made CI Ruwan Kumara of PNB as the 4th Respondent in his Petition,"
"that has been done on the basis that it was his complaint which had led to initiate the"
"investigations against the 2nd Petitioner by the CID and not on the basis that the 4th"
"Respondent is responsible for his physical arrest and detention in PNB premises."
