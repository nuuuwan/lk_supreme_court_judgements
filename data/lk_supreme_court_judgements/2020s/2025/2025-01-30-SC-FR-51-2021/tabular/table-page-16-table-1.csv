"I
 have already adverted to above, the material placed against the 2nd Petitioner. I am"
"of the view that the said material is sufficient to pass on the objective test, the decision"
"made by the Minister of Defence that there was sufficient basis for the issuance of the"
"Detention Order."
"The leaned Counsel for the Petitioner also advanced another argument with regard to"
"the  validity  of  the  Detention  Orders  marked  P  2(a),  P  2(b)  and  P  2(c).  It  is  the"
"submission  of  the  learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioner  that  it  is  only  the  Minsters  of"
"Defence  who  has  been  empowered  in  terms  of  Section  9(1)  of  the  PTA,  to  make"
"Detention Orders. It is also his submission that some of the Detention Orders [marked"
"P 2(a), P 2(b)] issued to detain the 2nd Petitioner have been signed by the President"
"and therefore not valid in law."
