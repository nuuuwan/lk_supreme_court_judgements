The Court of Appeal having considered a series of attendant facts and circumstances, had decided rather peculiarly to amend the charge contained in the indictment to one under section 314 of the Penal Code (causing hurt) and on that premise had taken into consideration the maximum sentence attaching the committing of the offence of \u2018hurt\u2019 and imposed a substantive term of 6 months rigorous imprisonment which sentence the Court of Appeal had deemed fit to suspend for a period of 5 years. I shall refrain from commenting on the legality and the appropriateness of the course of action adopted by the Court of Appeal and the substituted sentence imposed. That is primarily because the Hon. Attorney General for reasons not disclosed to this Court, does not seem to have been aggrieved or perturbed by the altered conviction and the lessor sentence imposed and therefore had not presented an Appeal to this Court in respect of the Judgment of the Court of Appeal. Thus, I shall leave that matter at rest, though the decision of the Court of Appeal and the subsequent inaction by the Honourable Attorney-General gives rise to considerable concern to this Court.",
