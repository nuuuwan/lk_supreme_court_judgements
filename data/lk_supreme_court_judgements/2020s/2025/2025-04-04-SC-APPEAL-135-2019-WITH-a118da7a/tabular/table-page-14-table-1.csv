"[25]  To strengthen this position the Court was of the view that “the Defendant whilst"
"giving evidence has admitted that the land in dispute is Lot 1 in Plan ‘X’, which"
"further confirms that there is no uncertainty as to the identity of the land”, whereas"
"the Defendant’s claim was not based only on Lot 1 but also included the land to"
"the southern boundary in Plan ‘X’. When the land was surveyed, the Defendant"
"claimed  his  rights  beyond  the  southern  boundary  of  Lot  1  however,  due  to  the"
"Plaintiffs’ insistence, the Surveyor limited the scope of the Commission only to"
"the land claimed by the Plaintiffs."
