By the said judgment, the High Court set aside the judgment of the District Court of Matale [the District Court] and granted the Substituted Plaintiff \u2013 Appellant \u2013 Respondent [the Plaintiff] the relief prayed for in the plaint. 2) Aggrieved, the Defendant \u2013 Respondent \u2013 Appellant [the Defendant] sought and obtained leave to appeal from this Court on 28th March 2013 on three questions of law which are set out in paragraph 39 of this judgment. 3) The primary issue that needs to be determined in this case is whether the Plaintiff has discharged the burden cast on a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action, with the Plaintiff claiming that the corpus in issue is praveni land [sometimes referred to as paraveni] and not maruvena land [sometimes referred to as bandara]. The facts in brief 4) The Plaintiff filed action on 7th November 2002 in the District Court of Matale stating that he is the owner of the land referred to in Schedule \u201cB\u201d to the plaint, in extent of 9A 3R 14P, by virtue of Deed No. 1807 dated 23rd November 1974 [P4]. The Plaintiff had referred to the several deeds by which his predecessors had acquired title, with the earliest deed having been executed on 5th December 1951. These deeds were tendered in evidence during the trial [P8 \u2013 P15] and although initially marked subject to proof, had been read in evidence without any objection at the time the case of the Plaintiff was closed. 5) The Plaintiff acknowledged in the plaint that the rights of his predecessors in title were subject to the performance of service to the Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya, which fact is reflected in the early deeds relied upon by the Plaintiff.",

He also claimed that he had effected improvements on the land which he valued at Rs. 2.5m and sought to recover the said sum in the event the Plaintiff was granted the relief that was sought. 9) Admissions and Issues were settled on 6th July 2006.

Money, in the form of coins and banknotes, is not easily identifiable and thus not easily vindicable.

    "text": "\u201cThe feudal land tenure system in Sri Lanka, commonly referred to as the \u201crajakariya\u201d system, is a historical one that started well before the colonial periods. The Sinhala king was the lord paramount of all the land in the country. On this basis (the) king granted away whole villages to temples or individual persons on sannasa (\u0dc3\u01e6\u0db1\u0dc3), royal grant etc., though much of the land was already held by private parties. A village (\u0d9c\u0db8) so granted to a temple is viharagama (\u026a\u0dc4\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0d9c\u0db8) or dewalagama (\u0dd9\u01ca\u0dc0\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0d9c\u0db8), and a village granted to an individual is nindagama (\u01e7\u01e6\u0daf\u0d9c\u0db8). The proprietor of a viharagama, dewalagama or nindagama was known as ninda proprietor or ninda lord. Each such village consisted of a number of holdings or allotments and each such holding was known as panguwa (\u0db4\u0d82\u011b\u0dc0). The ninda lord could assign such holdings to people subject to service (rajakariya). Such people are known as nilakarayas (\u01e7\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dcf). Nilakarayas were of two kinds, namely paraveni nilakaraya (\u0db4\u0dbbfjs\u01e7 \u01e7\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dcf) and maruwena nilakaraya (\u0db8\u0dcf\u025ef\u0dc0\u0db1 \u01e7\u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dba\u0dcf). Paraveni nilakaraya\u2019s panguwa is known as paraveni panguwa (\u0db4\u0dbbfjs\u01e7 \u0db4\u0d82\u011b\u0dc0) whereas maruwena nilakaraya\u2019s panguwa is known as maruvena panguwa (\u0db8\u0dcf\u025ef\u0dc0\u0db1 \u0db4\u0d82\u011b\u0dc0). Paraveni nilakarayas are those who held their lands before the nindagama or viharagama or dewalagama was granted to the ninda lord, and maruvena nilakarayas are those who received their lands from the ninda lord subsequent to the royal grant.",

[per Lascelles C. J. and Grenier J. in Tikiri Banda v Ranasinghe Mudalige Appuhamy [(1912) SC Minutes of 5th March, 1912] The first point to be determined, therefore, is whether each of the lands claimed by the plaintiffs is shown by the register to be a paraveni land. Moreover, prima facie evidence of title is all that is required in such an action. Prima facie evidence of title, of course, there must be. \u2026 I have now, I think, examined the whole body of evidence on which the plaintiffs rely. It is in many respects vague and unsatisfactory. But precise evidence in support of title to lands of the character that we have here to deal with cannot readily be procured. In view of this circumstance, and of the failure of the company to call the trustee to warrant and defend the title, which he conveyed to Ranasinghe, I am not prepared to say that the prima facie evidence does not justify a declaration of title and a decree for ejectment in the plaintiffs' favour.

    "text": "\u201cIn such background the issue is whether the Plaintiff was bound to prove the subject matter is praveni property in the absence of any pleading or issue contrary to such aspect. It is reiterated that parties admitted that the property in dispute is subject to service tenure to Dambulla Rajamaha Viharaya and the Defendant merely raised an issue that the action cannot be maintained since it is subject to such rajakariya. It is settled law that praveni nilakaraya is treated as the owner of the property subject to such rajakariya. It is true that if the subject matter is a maruvena property the Plaintiff is not entitled to a declaration of title to the land in dispute. Nevertheless on a perusal of the proceedings it is clear that it was not in dispute whether the subject matter is maruvena property or praveni property though the learned District Judge is of the view that the Plaintiff should prove it is a praveni property by adducing cogent evidence specially the relevant register which indicates whether the land in suit is in fact a praveni property or not.",

Hence, I am not inclined to agree with the High Court that the District Court went on a voyage of discovery when it considered the issue of whether the land was praveni or not. While I would thus answer the third question of law in the affirmative, I must state that the view expressed by the High Court that the District Court went on a voyage of discovery had no bearing on its final decision. 54) This brings me to the critical issue of whether the judgment of the High Court must",
