"The position of the petitioner had been that the witnesses led at the inquiry"
"had said that only a footpath had existed, not a roadway and that the paddy"
"land in question had not been cultivated since 2007."
"The Court of Appeal in the impugned order had said that since the main matter"
"is before the District Court, which the petitioner failed to mention, the decision"
"of the Agrarian services commissioner should stand until the original court"
"decides on the substantive issue."
"Being aggrieved by the said order the instant appeal has been filed."
"However, in the order marked as ‘R1’, the Commissioner has analyzed the"
"evidence led at the inquiry by the complainants and had revealed that the"
"roadway in question had been used by the complainants to carry out their"
"agricultural activities as per section 90(1) of the relevant act."
"The Commission has further considered the evidence of the relevant"
"Gramasevaka, who had corroborated the complainants and had said that the"
"petitioner had blocked the alleged roadway and had carried out illegal gemming"
"on the said land."
"The photographic evidence marked as ‘W9a’ and ‘W9e’ is indicative of a"
"pathway and not a footpath and the 1st and 2nd respondents further"
"corroborate the material in ‘R1’."
"The Court of Appeal when making the impugned order on 13.12.2019 had"
"taken all these material into consideration and the non-disclosure by the"
"petitioner before the Court of Appeal regarding the pendency of the District"
"Court case."
"Hence, the dismissal by the Court of Appeal is not only on the ground of not"
"divulging all the facts to Court, but upon the consideration of ‘R1’ and other"
"relevant documents such as ‘RR1’ to ‘RR4’."
"Thereafter, the Court of Appeal has very correctly decided that the orders made"
"by the Commissioner against the petitioner are only provisional orders which"
"have no bearing on the substantive rights of the parties and have directed the"
"matter to be decided by the respective District Court and until such time the"
"Commissioners order on 07.11.2016 is to prevail as per section 90(1) of the"
"Agrarian Development Act."
"Hence, I am of the view that there is no merit in the submissions made on"
"behalf of the appellant to disturb the findings of the Court of Appeal."
