Janak De Silva, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (Plaintiff) instituted this action to partition the

corpus identified as Aswaddume Kumbura containing of

paddy sowing. In the schedule of the plaint filed in 1974, the corpus is described as

follows:

,

:- , . .

, :-

, . . , :-

, ..

, :

. . . .

.

According to the Plaintiff, Bandirala was at one time the owner of the corpus. He had three

children named Appuhamy, Hethuhamy and Punchi Menika. Bandirala died intestate.

Accordingly, Appuhamy, Hethuhamy and Punchi Menika each inherited an undivided 1/3

share of the corpus.

By deed No. 7808 dated 31.08.1921 (P1) and attested by C.P. Senayanake, Notary Public,

Appuhamy sold his undivided 1/3 share to his two children, Dingiri Menika and Ukku

Menika. They sold their shares to the Plaintiff by deed No. 33, attested by O.G.W.

Dassanayake dated 06.07.1968 (P5).

Page 5 of 11

According to the Plaintiff, Hethuhamy died intestate and his share was inherited by the 1st

to 6th Defendant-Respondent-Respondents (1st to 6th Defendants).

Punchi Menika died intestate leaving her son Punchi Banda who inherited her undivided

1/3 share of the corpus. He also died intestate leaving as his heirs 7th to 15th Defendant-

Respondent-Respondents (7th to 15th Defendants).

The main contest between the parties was the identity of the corpus.

The learned trial judge held that the corpus was correctly identified and entered

interlocutory decree accepting the pedigree presented by the Plaintiff.

Aggrieved by the judgment of the District Court, the 1A (16), 17th, 18th and 19th Defendants

appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the District

Court.

Aggrieved by the judgment of the Court of Appeal, 1B (16A) and 19th Defendant-Appellant-

Appellants (Appellants) appealed to this Court. Special leave to appeal was granted on the

questions of law set out in paragraph 26 of the petition.

Nevertheless, during the argument, parties agreed to limit the appeal to the questions of

law set forth in paragraph 26 (b), (c) and (d). They are as follows:

(1) In the circumstances pleaded, is the Court of Appeal correct in holding that

there is sufficient evidence to identify the corpus and that the land shown in

the preliminary plan consist of the corpus?

(2) Has the Court of Appeal considered the fact that the Plaintiff had not

established his pedigree by leading cogent evidence?

(3) Since the learned District Judge had not answered the points of contest raised

at the trial, and also due to the fact that the learned District Judge had not

analysed and evaluated the evidence adduced at the trial in the correct

Page 6 of 11

perspective, is the judgment of the learned District Judge compliant with the

provisions in Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code?

Identity of the Corpus

Section 25 of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 (Partition Law) requires the trial judge to

examine the title of each party to the land to which the action relates. This duty to

investigate the title can only be embarked upon after the corpus is properly identified.

Once the corpus is identified, the trial judge must examine the documentary and oral

evidence to ascertain the title of each party to the corpus so identified.

There was no admission on the identity of the corpus. The Plaintiff raised a point of contest

on whether the corpus sought to be partitioned is depicted as lot Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in plan

No. 362. The 1st and 10th Defendants raised a point of contest on whether the land

described in the plaint is depicted as lot No. 2B in plan 362. In other words, the 1st and

10th Defendants took up the position that the partition action must be limited to lot No.

2B in plan 362.

Plan No. 362 was prepared by W.C.S.M. Abeysekera, Licensed Surveyor after a preliminary

survey. According to it, the total extent of the corpus is 3A 3R 12P. Lot 2B therein is 1A 0R

25P in extent.

The Appellants contend that according to the schedule to the plaint, the corpus to be

partitioned is which is the English equivalent to 1A 2R

10P.

In Ratnayake and Others v. Kumarihamy and Others [(2002) 1 Sri LR 65 at 68]

Weerasuriya, J., after referring to Ceylon Law Recorder, vol. XXII, page XLVI held:

However, it is to be noted that this system of land measure computed according to

the extent of land required to sow with paddy or Kurakkan vary due to the

interaction of several factors. The amount of seed required could vary according to

Page 7 of 11

the varying degrees of fertility of the soil, the size and quality of the grain, and the

peculiar qualities of the sower. In the circumstances, it is difficult to correlate

sowing extent accurately by reference to surface areas.

In fact, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent makes a similar contention in explaining the

discrepancy between the actual extent of the corpus and the extent set out in the

schedule to the plaint.

I am in respectful agreement with the proposition that the system of land measure

computed according to the extent of land required to sow with paddy or Kurakkan vary

due to the interaction of several factors. A mere discrepancy between this system of

measure and the actual extent of the corpus does not necessarily lead to the conclusion

that the corpus in a partition action is not identified.

Inconsistency in extent will not affect the question of identity if the portion of land to be

partitioned is clearly identified in the deeds forming the pedigree and can be precisely

ascertained.

In deed No. 7808 dated 31.08.1921 (P1), the boundaries of the corpus are identified as

follows:

:- ,

:- , :-

, :

The next deed No. 368 (P2) dated 01.06.1934 describes the corpus by reference to the

same boundaries. Deed No. 15309 (P3) dated 10.02.1938 also has the same boundaries.

The first difference in the boundaries can be seen in Mortgage Bond No. 7814 (P4) dated

12.06.1940, where the northern boundary is identified as :- ,

. The rest of the boundaries remained the same as described in P1, P2 and P3.

Page 8 of 11

The Plaintiff claims title through deed No. 33 (P5) dated 06.07.1968. The boundaries in

this deed are the same as the boundaries set out in the schedule to the plaint. There are

changes in all four boundaries compared to the boundaries set out in P1, P2 and P3. The

Plaintiff testified that he had got the boundaries changed to depict the boundaries that

were in existence at the time P5 was executed.

I observe that even by 1968, the corpus had not been surveyed and a plan prepared. In

these circumstances, I do not find anything objectionable in P5 setting forth the existing

boundaries after referring to the earlier boundaries.

However, the Plaintiff, during his evidence-in-chief testified that there was a dispute when

he tried to cultivate part of the corpus in 1968 and at that point of time, the dispute was

referred to the Mediation Board. P5 was also executed in 1968.

Moreover, the discrepancy between the extent of the corpus identified in the plaint and

the extent identified at the preliminary survey is 2A 1R 2P. This is not a discrepancy that

can be explained away by merely referring to infirmities in the use of the traditional

Sinhala measures.

The Plaintiff sought to explain the discrepancy by claiming that this was due to the filling

up of a lake that was bordering the corpus. The learned District Judge appears to have

accepted this explanation.

Nonetheless, in arriving at his decision, the learned District Judge failed to consider a

material aspect of the case. The Plaintiffs explanation was that a portion of land, initially

situated outside the corpus and forming part of a lake, had subsequently become

integrated with the corpus. However, the Plaintiff did not assert a prescriptive title to the

corpus in the plaint. Instead, he relied solely upon the deeds produced in evidence and

the principles of intestate succession. Despite this, during the formulation of the points of

contest, the Plaintiff succeeded in introducing an issue relating to prescription.

Page 9 of 11

Nevertheless, this issue was confined strictly to the land derived under the said deeds and

by way of intestate succession. At no point was a prescriptive claim advanced in respect

of any land beyond the extent described as ' ', which was

the portion later merged with the corpus.

Significantly, the Surveyors report regarding the identity of the corpus does not support

the Plaintiffs case. Admittedly, in the preliminary plan, the Surveyor has recorded the

extent of the corpus as 3A 3R 12P. However, as the preliminary survey was conducted

under the Partition Act No. 16 of 1951, the report contains no specific affirmation that the

land surveyed and the land sought to be partitioned, as described in the plaint, are one

and the same. Accordingly, the Surveyors report does not conclusively establish the

identity of the corpus in favour of the Plaintiff.

In this context, I observe that the District Court had directed the same Surveyor to make

a further survey of the land. This appears to have been on the application of the 1st

Defendant. This further survey was done on 15.12.1977. His report reads as follows:

,

1977-12-15 .

1

362 2 .

362 2B .

1 0 00 .

1 .

.

2.

The Surveyor ultimately stated that there exists an error in the schedule, and that he is

unable to determine whether the said error pertains to the extent or the boundaries of

the land. However, the learned District Judge, in reaching his conclusion, relied solely on

the earlier portion of the Surveyors report, while disregarding the Surveyors express

conclusion that he was unable to clarify whether the discrepancy lies in the extent or in

the boundaries. This selective reliance on the evidence constitutes a misdirection in law.

The Surveyor, being an expert witness, provided evidence that is pivotal in establishing

the identity of the corpus. Both of his reports were admitted into evidence without

objection, thereby rendering his entire testimony properly before the Court.

Consequently, the learned trial judge was obliged to evaluate the totality of the Surveyor's

evidence and assign to it the appropriate probative value. However, in the present case,

the learned trial judge erred in law by according weight to only a portion of the Surveyors

evidence while disregarding the remainder.

Upon a consideration of all the evidence led on the identification of the corpus, I hold that

the Plaintiff has failed to identify the corpus.

I answer the question of law No. 1 in the negative.

In view of my conclusions on question of law No. 1, there is no necessity to answer the

other questions of law.

Page 11 of 11

For all the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated

04.09.2012 and the judgment of the District Court of Kurunegala dated 26.10.1995.

I have given anxious consideration to whether justice can be served by sending this case

back for trial de novo or to dismiss the action. However, I have concluded that no purpose

can be served by directing a trial de novo as the 1st Defendant did at the outset claim that

the partition action must be limited to lot 2B in plan 362, which was rejected by the

Plaintiff.

Accordingly, I have no option but to dismiss the action. Parties shall bear their costs.
