"For  all  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  set  aside  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  dated"
"04.09.2012 and the judgment of the District Court of Kurunegala dated 26.10.1995."
"I have given anxious consideration to whether justice can be served by sending this case"
"back for trial de novo or to dismiss the action. However, I have concluded that no purpose"
"can be served by directing a trial de novo as the 1st  Defendant did at the outset claim that"
"the  partition  action  must  be  limited  to  lot  2B  in  plan  362,  which  was  rejected  by  the"
"Plaintiff."
"Accordingly, I have no option but to dismiss the action. Parties shall bear their costs."
