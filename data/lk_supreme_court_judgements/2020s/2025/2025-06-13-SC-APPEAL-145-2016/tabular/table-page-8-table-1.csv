"defendants which includes the 1st and 2nd defendants as well has not been challenged in appeal"
"by the 3A defendant. The exparte judgment stands unchallenged.”"
"F
urther  the  learned  Court  of  Appeal  Judges  has  stated  that  the  learned  District  Judge  had"
"carefully analyzed the evidence and has correctly refused the objections and allow the Plaintiff"
"to execute decree of the District Court."
"W
hen one reads the above reasons given by the Court of Appeal, as well as the learned District"
"Judge, it may give the impression, that, as prayer (e) was granted by the ex parte Judgment,"
"grant of that relief itself allows evicting the 1st and 2nd Defendants qua 1st and 2nd Defendant as"
"it is prayed in that part of the prayer to evict all the Defendants and all who claims under them"
"from the encroached portion and put the Plaintiff back in peaceful possession. However, the"
"case between the Plaintiff and the 1st and 2nd Defendants concluded with the inspection and the"
"inter  parte  Judgment  made  in  accordance  with  the  inspection.  Thus,  as  far  as  the  ex  parte"
"Judgment  against  3A  Defendant  is  concerned,  prayer  (e)  in  the  Plaint  has  to  be  read  and"
"understood as a relief prayed for to evict the 3rd Defendant and all who claim under her from"
"the said encroached portion of the land as 1st and 2nd Defendants are not parties to the ex parte"
"trial and Judgment. If the 1st and 2nd Defendants fall within the category of ‘all who claim under"
"the 3rd Defendant’, irrespective of the fact that they were the 1st and 2nd Defendants for the inter"
"parte Judgment, they have to face the consequence of the issuance of the writ against the 3A"
"Defendant. Even if they were never Defendants in this case, and only 3A was the Defendant,"
"still if they fall under the term ‘all who claim under 3A Defendant’, they are bound to respect"
"the decree. If the 1st and 2nd Defendants do not fall under the term ‘all who claim under the 3rd"
"Defendant’, they can make their claim or objection when the writ of possession is executed,"
"but here admittedly, through their Answer, they have stated that the Plaintiff has no right to file"
"or maintain an action of the nature of what is contained in the Plaint against them, indicating"
"that they have nothing to do with the cause of action of the Plaintiff, which is based on the"
"encroachment of his property, apparently because they are tenants of the 3rd Defendant, who is"
"the  landlord.  When  the  writ  is  issued  against  the  legal  representative  of  the  3rd  Defendant,"
"namely 3A defendant, they cannot say that they do not fall under the term “All who claim under"
"the 3rd Defendant”. In fact, the relevant part of the amended decree which is relevant to the ex"
"parte Judgment, order to evict the 3A Defendant and all who claim under 3A Defendant. Thus,"
"the amended decree and any writ of execution based on that amended decree is lawful. On the"
"other hand, any unlawful encroachment done in favour of the 3rd Defendant has to be proceeded"
