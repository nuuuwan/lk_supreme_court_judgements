"A.   Does not arise as the Judgment against the 1st and 2nd Defendants appear to have been"
"made after inspection in terms of Sections 408 and 428 of the C P C. Thus, no appeal"
"lies. Judgment against the 3rd Defendant was made ex parte and 3rd Defendant did not"
"move  to  vacate  it.  1st  and  2nd  Defendants  being  persons  claimed  under  the  3rd"
"Defendant and not a party to the ex parte trial, has no right of appeal over it."
"O
n the other hand, as said before, the 1st and 2nd Defendants do not have any rights to the lands"
"of the Plaintiff. Their contractual rights as tenants are with the 3A Defendant. That has nothing"
"to do with the rights of the Plaintiffs relating to the encroached lands of the Plaintiff. The 1st"
"and 2nd Defendants have not claimed any land rights to that portion, nor have any contractual"
"rights with the Plaintiff as to the tenancy. Therefore, it cannot be said that any substantial right"
"of the 1st and 2nd Defendants are going to be affected by the enforcement of the amended decree."
"I
 do not see any reasonable ground for making these appeals to the Court of Appeal and then"
"to this Court other than relying on mere technicalities without any merit. The conduct of the"
"Appellant  has  hindered  the  Plaintiff  enjoying  his  victory  peacefully  for  about  twenty  years."
"Thus, this Court orders that the Plaintiff-Respondent is entitled to twice the amount of taxed"
"costs."
"H
ence, this appeal is dismissed with costs as above."
