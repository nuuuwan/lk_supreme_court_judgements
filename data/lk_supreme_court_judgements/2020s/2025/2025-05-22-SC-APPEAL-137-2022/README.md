Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Panadura against

the three defendants, seeking a declaration of title to the land described in

the second schedule to the plaint, which encompasses the land described

in the fourth schedule, presently in the possession of the 2A defendant.

According to the plaintiff, the land situated immediately to the east of her

land, which is described in the third schedule to the plaint, belonged to the

1st defendant and was, at the relevant time, in the possession of the 2nd and

3rd defendants. The 1st defendant did not respond to summons and the case

was fixed for ex parte trial against her. The 2nd and 3rd defendants filed an

answer seeking the dismissal of the plaintiffs action and a declaration that

they are entitled to the land described in the schedule to their answer,

which does not correspond to any of the lands described in the schedules

to the plaint. After trial, the District Court entered judgment for the plaintiff,

which was affirmed by the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kalutara. Hence

this appeal by the 2A defendant.

SC/APPEAL/137/2022

The 1st defendant was the owner of the larger land described in the first

schedule to the plaint. She transferred a specific portion of this landLot 2

in Plan No. 3490 dated 21.12.1983 (2A V1), which is 6.75 perches in

extentto the 2nd and 3rd defendants by Deed No. 4828 dated 19.01.1984

(2A V2), which was registered at the Land Registry on 25.01.1984. The

plaintiff did not disclose this Deed in the plaint.

Thereafter, the 1st defendant transferred another specific portion of the

larger landLot A in Plan No. 855 dated 07.07.1981 (P1), which is 7.75

perches in extentto the plaintiff by Deed No. 320 dated 01.03.1984 (P3),

which was registered at the Land Registry on 17.04.1984. This land is

described in the second schedule to the plaint.

The two parcels of land are situated adjacent to each other. The land

claimed by the defendants lies immediately to the east of the plaintiffs land.

The dispute concerns the precise boundary between the two lands.

There can be no dispute that the defendants Deed gets priority over the

plaintiffs Deed. When the defendants raised the issue of whether they were

the owners of the land described in the schedule to the answer, there was

no need for a separate specific issue on priority to be raised in the District

Court, as that question was subsumed within the broader issue of

establishing title.

It is true that the original owner, the 1st defendant, first sold a portion of

the land depicted in one Plan to the 2nd and 3rd defendants, and thereafter

sold another portion on a different Plan to the plaintiff. However, this

sequence of transactions does not suggest any collusion between the 1st

defendant and the 2nd and 3rd defendants to defraud the plaintiff, as was

suggested by learned counsel for the plaintiff during the argument. At the

time the 1st defendant sold the land to the 2nd and 3rd defendants, the

plaintiff was unknown to any of the parties. The plaintiff purchased a

4

SC/APPEAL/137/2022

different portion of the larger land on the basis of another Plan

subsequently.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff argued that the 1st defendant executed an

Agreement to Sell No. 4780 dated 29.06.1983 in favour of the 2nd and 3rd

defendants to sell Lot B in Plan No. 855 in extent of 11.19 perches and

placed the 2nd and 3rd defendants in possession of that portion. This land is

described in the third schedule to the plaint. The 2nd and 3rd defendants

accept the existence of the said Sale Agreement. What the defendants state

is that although an Agreement to Sell was entered into for the sale of Lot B

in Plan No. 855 in extent of 11.19 perches, what was ultimately sold was a

lesser extent of 6.75 perches on Plan No. 3490 dated 21.12.1983. This is

not unusual. The 2nd and 3rd defendants cannot be found fault with it. It

cannot be construed as a collusion among the three defendants to defraud

the plaintiff.

For the purpose of this case, the plaintiff obtained a commission, and

licensed surveyor Sampath Fernando prepared Plan No. 1105 (P7) based on

the plaintiffs Plan No. 855. By superimposition, he identified the

encroached portion as Lot A3, which is 2.2 perches in extent. There is no

dispute over this Plan.

On the other hand, the 2nd defendant also obtained a commission, and

licensed surveyor Malwanna prepared Plan No. 2480 (2A V3) based on the

2nd and 3rd defendants Plan No. 3490. By superimposition, he identified the

encroached portion as A2, which is 00.02 perch in extent. In their amended

answer, the 2nd and 3rd defendants themselves stated that they are willing

to forgo the portion marked as Lot A2 in Plan No. 2480. There is no dispute

regarding this Plan either. Both Plans are accurate.

The error committed by the District Court, and perpetuated by the High

Court, was in deciding the case based on Mr. Sampath Fernandos Plan No.

5

SC/APPEAL/137/2022

1105, rather than on Mr. Malwannas Plan No. 2480, perhaps because the

former was prepared on a commission taken by the plaintiff. However, Mr.

Sampath Fernandos Plan, which was prepared based on Plan No. 855, does

not assist in identifying the disputed portion, particularly in view of the fact

that the Deed and Plan of the 2nd and 3rd defendants take precedence over

those of the plaintiff, by reason of priority, as I have already explained. If I

may reiterate, the land of the 2nd and 3rd defendants (Lot 2 in Plan No. 3490)

must first be identified and excluded. Only thereafter should the plaintiffs

land (Lot A in Plan No. 855) be identified. This was not done by the Courts

below.

The questions of law on which leave to appeal has been granted are as

follows:

(a) Did the High Court fail to consider the 2A defendants claim based

on prescriptive title?

(b) Did the High Court err in failing to identify the corpus?

(c) Did the High Court fail to properly evaluate the evidence relating to

the 2A defendants paper title?

I answer (b) and (c) above in the affirmative. There is no necessity to answer

(a) above.

The appeal of the 2A defendant is allowed. The plaintiffs action in the

District Court shall stand dismissed. The cross claim of the 2nd and 3rd

defendants is allowed. The said defendants are entitled to Lot B in Plan No.

2480 dated 20.01.2004, which is 6.75 perches in extent. The 2A defendant

is not entitled to Lot A2 in the said Plan, which is 0.02 perch in extent. That

portion shall accrue to the plaintiffs land, unless the plaintiff is willing to

sell it to the 2A defendant, as suggested in his answer. The parties shall

bear their own costs. The learned District Judge will enter decree in

accordance with this judgment.
