"The  1st  defendant  was  the  owner  of  the  larger land  described  in  the  first"
"schedule to the plaint. She transferred a specific  portion of this land—Lot 2"
"in  Plan  No.  3490  dated  21.12.1983

"Thereafter,  the  1st  defendant  transferred  another  specific  portion  of  the"
"larger land—Lot  A  in  Plan  No.  855  dated  07.07.1981 
(P1),  which  is  7.75"
