"framework  of  the 
law,  bearing 
in  mind  that  the  policy  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure  Code  is to avoid multiplicity of actions.  In Grace De Alwis v."
"Walter De Alwis (1971)  76  NLR 444,  it was held  that “The statement in"
"the judgment of a divisional bench in Lebbe v. Sandanam (64 N.L.R. 461)"
"that in no circumstances can a new cause of action be added when a plaint"
"is amended was made obiter and is now not followed.”"
"However, the Court is not bound to grant the amendment solely because"
"it  was  sought  before  the  pre-trial  conference  but  must  consider  the"
"nature of the application."
"Amendments made mala fide, in abuse of the process  of Court, with the"
"sole intention of prolonging proceedings,  and thereby gaining an unfair"
"advantage, must not be permitted."
"Amendments  that  introduce  entirely  new  causes  of  action  and  new"
"positions,  altering  the  fundamental  character  of  the  action  cannot  be"
"allowed.  For  example, 
if  a  plaintiff 
initially  files  an  action  claiming"
"damages for breach of the contract and later seeks  to amend the plaint"
"to  claim  damages  based  on  fraud  arising  from  the  same  transaction,"
"such  an  amendment,  which  introduces  a  new  cause  of  action,  would"
"alter  the  fundamental  character  of  the  case  and  would  therefore  be"
"impermissible."
"The 
first  proviso  to  section  46  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  states:"
"“Provided that  no  amendment  shall  be  allowed which  would  have  the"
"effect of converting an action of one character into an action of another and"
"inconsistent character.”"
"Amendments 
that  would  prejudice 
defences 
such

of"
"prescription  are not  permitted.  (Weldon v.  Neal  (1887)  19  Q.B.D.  394,"
"Hall v. Meyrick [1957] 2 Q.B. 455, Waduganathan  Chettiar v. Sena Abdul"
"Cassim  (1952)  54  NLR 185)  For  instance,  a plaintiff  files  an  action on"
"01.01.2023

of  a  written  contract
