"In the oft-quoted case of Gunasekera v. Abdul Latiff [1995]  1 Sri LR 225"
"at 232, Ranaraja J. stated:"
"The amendments to pleading on or after first date of trial can now"
"be allowed only in very limited circumstances. It prohibits court from"
"allowing an application for amendment at this stage unless (1) it is"
"satisfied that grave and irremediable injustice will be caused if the"
"amendment is not permitted, and (2) the party applying has not been"
"guilty of laches. On no other ground, can court allow an application"
"for  an  amendment  of  pleadings.  Furthermore,  court  is  obliged to"
"record reasons  for  concluding  that  the  two  conditions referred to"
"have been satisfied."
