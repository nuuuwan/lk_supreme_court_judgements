"section 93(2) is the former, not the latter."
"Section 93(2), as presently constituted, reads as follows:"
"On or after the day first fixed for pre-trial conference of the action"
"and before final judgment, no application for the amendment of any"
"pleadings shall be allowed unless the Court is satisfied, for reasons"
"to be recorded by the Court,  that grave and  irremediable injustice"
"will be caused if such amendment is not permitted, and on no other"
"ground, and that the party so applying has not been guilty of laches."
