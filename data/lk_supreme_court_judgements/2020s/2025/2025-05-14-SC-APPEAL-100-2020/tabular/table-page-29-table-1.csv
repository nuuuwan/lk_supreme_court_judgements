"75 states:"
"The  function  of  pleadings  then  is  to  ascertain  with  precision the"
"matters on which  the parties differ and  the points on  which they"
"agree;  and  thus  to  arrive  at  certain  clear  issues  on  which  both"
"parties desire a judicial decision. In order to attain this object, it is"
"necessary  that  the  pleadings  interchanged  between  the  parties"
"should  be  conducted  according  to  certain  fixed  rules.  The  main"
"purpose of these rules is to compel each party to state clearly and"
"intelligibly the material facts on which he relies, omitting everything"
"immaterial, and then to insist on his opponent frankly admitting or"
"explicitly denying every material matter alleged against him. By this"
"method they must speedily arrive at an  issue. Neither party need"
"disclose  in  his  pleading  the  evidence  by  which  he  proposes  to"
"establish his case at the trial. But each must give his opponent a"
"sufficient outline of his case."
