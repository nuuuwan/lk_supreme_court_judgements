"SC/APPEAL/100/2020"
"39"
"before  the  District  Court  in  support  of  their  application  to  amend  the"
"pleadings."
"Firstly, they contended that since the case was not fixed for trial, section"
"93(1) was applicable. This contention is manifestly erroneous, as section"
"93(1) cannot be invoked when an application for amendment is made on"
"or after the date first fixed for pre-trial."
"Secondly,  they argued that there  is a conflict  of interest between the 1st"
"and  the  2nd  defendants,  and  that  unless  they  are  permitted  to  file"
"separate answers clearly articulating their respective  positions,  a grave"
"injustice would be caused to them."
"The purported “conflict of interest” and “grave injustice” were foreseeable"
"at the time the 1st and 2nd defendants  chose  to file a joint answer, joint"
"admissions  and issues,  and a joint list of witnesses  and documents,  at"
"three  separate  occasions  after  deliberations.  In  any  event,  if  they  had"
"really intended to amend the joint answer and file separate answers, they"
"ought to have made the application  for amendment of pleadings  before"
"the date the case was first fixed for the pre-trial, not on the date the case"
"was taken up for pre-trial."
"The High Court did not appreciate both the law and the facts of the case."
"It  appears 
that  the  High  Court  proceeded  on 
the  basis 
that  the"
"amendments  would  not  surprise  the  plaintiff  and  therefore  could  be"
"permitted.  I  am  surprised  that  the  High  Court  did  not  consider  the"
"applicability of section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code at all."
"I unhesitatingly answer the question of law on which leave to appeal was"
"granted in the affirmative. Accordingly, the judgment of the High Court"
"dated  09.01.2020 
is  set  aside,  and  the  judgment  of  the  District  Court"
"dated 28.11.2018  is restored. The appeal is allowed with costs."
"As  agreed,  the  parties 
in  SC/APPEAL/101/2020  will  abide  by  this"
"judgment."
