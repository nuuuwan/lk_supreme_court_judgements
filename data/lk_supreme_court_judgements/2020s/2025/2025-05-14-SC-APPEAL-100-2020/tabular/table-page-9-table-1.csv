"9"
"46(1) Every plaint presented by a registered attorney on behalf of a"
"plaintiff shall be subscribed by such  registered attorney.  In  every"
"other case in which a plaint is presented, it shall be subscribed by"
"the plaintiff; and his signature shall be verified by the signature of"
"some officer authorized by the court in that behalf."
"(2)  Before  the  plaint  (whether  presented  by  the  plaintiff  or  by  a"
"registered attorney in  his  behalf)  is allowed to be  filed, the  court"
"may, if in its discretion it shall think fit, refuse to entertain the same"
"for any of the following reasons, namely:-"
"(a) if it does not state correctly, and  without prolixity, the  several"
"particulars hereinbefore required to be specified therein;"
"(b) if it contains any particulars other than those so required;"
"(c) if it is not subscribed, or subscribed and verified, as the case may"
"be, as hereinbefore required;"
"(d) if it does not disclose a cause of action;"
"(e) if it is not framed in accordance with section 33;"
"(f) if it is wrongly framed by reason of non-joinder or misjoinder of"
"parties, or because the plaintiff has  joined causes of action which"
"ought not to be joined in the same action;"
"and may return the same for amendment then and there, or within"
"such time as may be fixed by the court, upon such terms as to the"
"payment of costs occasioned by the amendment as the court thinks"
"fit;"
"Provided that  no  amendment shall be  allowed which would have"
"the effect of converting an  action of one character into an  action of"
"another and inconsistent character;"
"And provided further, that in each of the following cases, namely:-"
"(g) Where the relief sought is undervalued, and the plaintiff, on being"
"required by the court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed"
"by the court, fails to do so;"
