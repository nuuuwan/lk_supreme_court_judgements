"In Kuruppuarachchi  v. Andreas (supra) at page 13, G.P.S.  De Silva C.J."
"concluded:"
"Turning  now to the averments in the amended answer, it is clear"
"that the defendant was well aware of the fact that the plaintiff was"
"living  in  adultery  at  the  time the  answer  was  filed, but  she  has"
"chosen not to rely on that ground in her answer. After the second"
"date  of trial, she  is seeking  to amend  the  answer by  including  a"
"cause  of  action  based  on  adultery.  In  these  circumstances,  the"
"conclusion of  the  Court  of  Appeal,  that  the  defendant  is  guilty of"
"laches and that the amended answer has to be rejected in terms of"
"section 93(2) (as amended) must be affirmed."
