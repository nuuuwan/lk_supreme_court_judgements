"back to the date of the original plaint or answer. In Lucihamy v. Hamidu"
"(1923) 26 NLR 41 at 43-44, Bertram C.J. stated:"
"It has been settled both by local and by English decisions that when"
"an amended plaint or statement of claim is filed, it is considered for"
"all  purposes as  relating  back  to  the  date of  the  original plaint  or"
"statement  of  claim.  In  Weldon  v.  Neal  (1887)  19  Q.B.D.  394  an"
"amendment of a statement of claim was disallowed, on the ground"
"that  it  sought  to  include  fresh  claims  which  at  the  time  of  the"
"amendment was barred by the Statute of Limitations, although not"
"barred  at 
the  date  of 
the  writ.  Lord  Esher  M.R.  said:  “If  an"
"amendment were allowed setting up a cause of action, which, if the"
"writ were issued in respect thereof at the date of the amendment,"
"would be barred by the Statute of Limitations, it would be allowing"
"the plaintiff to take advantage of her former writ to defeat the statute"
"and taking away an existing right from the defendant, a proceeding"
"which, as  a  general  rule, would be,  in  my opinion,  improper and"
"unjust. We have the converse case in our own books (see Morris v."
"Dias (1892)  2  C.L.R. 185).  In  that case, after the  institution of an"
"action  on  a  promissory  note, 
the  plaint  was  amended  by 
the"
"addition of an alternative count for goods sold and delivered. It was"
"there held that the period of limitation must be reckoned up to the"
"date  of  the  original  summons,  and  not  up 
to  the  date  of  the"
"amendment. “This new cause,” said Withers J., “relates back to the"
"date of the original writ.”"
