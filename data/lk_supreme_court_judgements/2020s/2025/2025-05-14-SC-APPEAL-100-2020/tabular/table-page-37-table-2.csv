"articulating the rationale behind this approach, Willis J. highlighted the"
"increasing inconvenience caused by delays associated with amendments:"
"It has long been my conviction that the commencement of a trial is"
"the fulcrum upon which the courtsâ€™ stance in respect of applications"
"for amendments to pleadings should be balanced. The further away"
"the  parties  are  from the  commencement of  the  trial,  the  easier  it"
"should be for a litigant to obtain an amendment and, conversely, the"
"deeper  the  parties  are  into  trial  and  the  nearer  they  may  be  to"
"obtaining judgment, the more difficult it ought to be."
