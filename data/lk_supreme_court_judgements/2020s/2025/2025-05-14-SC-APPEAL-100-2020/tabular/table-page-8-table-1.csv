"SC/APPEAL/100/2020"
"8"
"controversy  between  the parties should be  permitted at any stage from"
"the  commencement  of  trial to  final judgment,  so  long  as any resulting"
"prejudice or injustice could be cured by costs, can no longer be regarded"
"as good law."
"The  administration  of  justice  today  extends  beyond  the  resolution  of"
"disputes  between  individual  parties.  The  modern  conception  of  justice"
"emphasises  fairness and access to justice for all, rather than justice for"
"one at the expense of many. A significant backlog of cases exists at every"
"level of the judicial hierarchy. The concept of effective case management"
"has  gained  global  recognition  as  essential  to  the proper  functioning  of"
"the justice system. When cases are repeatedly postponed and allowed to"
"stagnate, effective case management is undermined, the efficiency of the"
"entire system is compromised, and access to justice is ultimately denied."
"Access to justice is a cornerstone  of the rule of law. If undue delays and"
"procedural  inefficiencies  are  allowed  to  persist,  the  erosion  of  public"
"confidence  in the legal system becomes  inevitable."
"Whether  in  superior  Courts or  original  Courts, there  is  no  doubt  that"
"litigants must be afforded a fair hearing, but the Court cannot afford, in"
"my view, an unlimited hearing. We must understand that the demands"
"and exigencies of contemporary justice are fundamentally different from"
"those that prevailed decades  ago. Litigants are not entitled to unfettered"
"use of judicial time, as other litigants await their turn. This shift reflects"
"the  current  trend  across  all  major  jurisdictions,  which  I  will  discuss"
"further under the subheading “Global Trends”."
"Amendment of pleadings before accepting the plaint or answer"
"Once the plaint or answer is filed,  the Court may, ex mero motu, return"
"it for amendment  without accepting  it. Sections  46  and 77  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code are relevant in this regard."
"Section 46 deals with when a plaint can be returned for amendment or"
"rejected by the Court."
