Factual matrix

By Deed No. 981 dated 18.04.1989 the 1st defendant gifted the land

described in the 6th schedule to the plaint to the plaintiff. Thereafter, the

1st defendant revoked that gift by Deed No. 159 dated 24.06.2014, and

transferred the land by Deed No. 176 dated 24.12.2014 to the 2nd

defendant.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Gampaha seeking a

declaration that he is the owner of the land described in the 6th schedule

to the plaint, and cancellation of Deed Nos. 159 and 176. The Land

Registrar of Gampaha was made the 3rd defendant to give effect to the

said orders in the event he succeeds.

The 1st and 2nd defendants filed a joint answer seeking the dismissal of

the plaintiffs action, while the 3rd defendant filed a separate answer. The

District Judge fixed the case for pre-trial on 23.03.2018.

In the meantime, the 1st and 2nd defendants filed a joint list of witnesses

and documents, and proposed admissions and issues with copies to the

opposite parties. The plaintiff and the 3rd defendant also did so.

On 23.03.2018, when the case was taken up for the pre-trial, the

revocation papers of the then existing proxy and the new proxy were filed

on behalf of the 1st defendant, and the 1st and 2nd defendants tendered

separate amended answers. The plaintiff objected, and the District

Judge, after hearing the parties by way of written submissions, refused

to accept the amended answers by order dated 28.11.2018, as the Court

was not satisfied that the conditions stipulated in section 93(2) of the

3

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

Civil Procedure Code had been fulfilled by the 1st and 2nd defendants. In

reaching that finding, the District Judge analysed the statutory

provisions and relevant case law in the said order.

Being dissatisfied with this order, the 1st and 2nd defendants appealed to

the High Court of Civil Appeal of Gampaha with leave obtained. By

judgment dated 09.01.2020, the High Court set aside the order of the

District Judge without referring to any statutory provisions or case law

governing the amendment of pleadings in a civil case, and directed the

District Judge to accept the amended answers. I regret that I am unable

to comprehend the reasoning (quoted below) upon which the High Court

set aside the order of the District Judge.

This Court granted leave to appeal against this Judgment of the High

Court on the following question of law:

Did the High Court of Civil Appeal err in law by not considering

whether the 1st and 2nd defendants have complied with section 93(2)

of the Civil Procedure Code as amended?

Historical development of statutory provisions

The Civil Procedure Code dedicates a separate chapterChapter XVto

the subject of amendment of pleadings. This chapter contains only one

section, namely, section 93. The fact that an entire chapter is devoted to

a single section underscores the importance the legislature has attached

to it.

As originally enacted, section 93 granted the Court broad discretion to

allow amendments to pleadings at any hearing of the case, up until the

delivery of the final judgment. Section 93, as it originally stood, read as

follows:

At any hearing of the action, or any time in the presence of, or after

reasonable notice to, all the parties to the action before final

judgment, the court shall have full power of amending in its

discretion, and upon such terms as to costs and postponement of

day for filing answer or replication or for hearing of cause, or

otherwise, as it may think fit, all pleadings and processes in the

action, by way of addition, or of alteration, or of omission. And the

amendments or additions shall be clearly written on the face of the

pleading or process affected by the order; or if this cannot

conveniently be done, a fair draft of the document as altered shall

be appended to the document intended to be amended, and every

such amendment or alteration shall be initialled by the Judge.

5

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

This section was repealed and replaced by a new section under the Civil

Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 79 of 1988. Following this

amendment, section 93 read as follows:

93(1) The court may, in exceptional circumstances and for reasons

to be recorded, at any hearing of the action, or at any time in the

presence of, or after reasonable notice to all the parties to the action,

before final judgment, amend all pleadings and processes in the

action by way of addition, or of alteration or of omission.

(2) Every order for amendment made under this section shall be

upon such terms as to costs and postponement of the date fixed for

the filing of answer, or replication, or for the hearing of the cause or

otherwise, as the court may think fit.

(3) The amendments or additions made in pursuance of an order

under this section shall be clearly written on the pleadings or

processes affected by the order; or if it cannot be conveniently so

done, a fair draft of the document as altered shall be appended to

the document intended to be amended and every such amendment

or alteration shall be initialled by the judge.

Section 93 was again repealed and substituted with a new section under

the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 9 of 1991. Following this

amendment, section 93 read as follows:

93(1) Upon application made to it before the day first fixed for trial

of the action, in the presence of, or after reasonable notice to all the

parties to the action, the Court shall have full power of amending in

its discretion, all pleadings in the action, by way of addition, or

alteration, or of omission.

(2) On or after the day first fixed for the trial of the action and before

final judgement, no application for the amendment of any pleadings

shall be allowed unless the Court is satisfied, for reasons to be

6

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

recorded by the Court, that grave and irremediable injustice will be

caused if such amendment is not permitted, and on no other ground,

and that the party so applying has not been guilty of laches.

(3) Any application for amendment of pleadings which may be

allowed by the Court under subsection (1) or (2) shall be upon such

terms as to costs and postponement or otherwise as the Court may

think fit.

(4) The additions or alterations or omissions shall be clearly made

on the face of the pleading affected by the order; or if this cannot

conveniently be done, a fair copy of the pleading as altered shall, be

appended in the record of the action to the pleading amended. Every

such addition or alteration or omission shall be signed by the Judge.

After this amendment, section 93 was amended by the Civil Procedure

Code (Amendment) Act No. 8 of 2017 whereby, for the words first fixed

for trial in subsections (1) and (2), the words first fixed for Pre-Trial

were substituted.

Thereafter, by the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 29 of 2023,

the words first fixed for Pre-Trial of the action in subsections (1) and

(2), were substituted by the words first fixed for Pre-Trial conference of

the action.

Section 93, as it presently constitutes reads as follows:

93(1) Upon application made to it before the day first fixed for pre-

trial conference of the action, in the presence of, or after reasonable

notice to all the parties to the action, the Court shall have full power

of amending in its discretion, all pleadings in the action, by way of

addition, or alteration, or of omission.

(2) On or after the day first fixed for the pre-trial conference of the

action and before final judgement, no application for the amendment

of any pleadings shall be allowed unless the Court is satisfied, for

7

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

reasons to be recorded by the Court, that grave and irremediable

injustice will be caused if such amendment is not permitted, and on

no other ground, and that the party so applying has not been guilty

of laches.

(3) Any application for amendment of pleadings which may be

allowed by the Court under subsection (1) or (2) shall be upon such

terms as to costs and postponement or otherwise as the Court may

think fit.

(4) The additions or alterations or omissions shall be clearly made

on the face of the pleading affected by the order; or if this cannot

conveniently be done, a fair copy of the pleading as altered shall, be

appended in the record of the action to the pleading amended. Every

such addition or alteration or omission shall be signed by the Judge.

Ironically, as section 93 originally stood, the Judge had no discretion to

amend the pleadings before trial. Amendments were permitted only after

the commencement of the trial but before judgment. Section 93 began

with: At any hearing of the action, or any time in the presence of, or after

reasonable notice to, all the parties to the action before final judgment, the

court shall have full power of amending in its discretion all pleadings in

the action. In Lebbe v. Sandanam (1963) 64 NLR 461 at 467, Basnayake

C.J. observed: The Court may not exercise that power before the hearing

or after final judgment. The words at any time in the context mean at any

time after the hearing and not at any time before the hearing. What must

be emphasised is that the current legal position stands in stark contrast

to this.

Under the present law, amendments are permitted only before the day

first fixed for the pre-trial conference of the action, except in exceptional

circumstances falling within section 93(2).

The previously accepted view that all amendments necessary for the

proper ventilation of the dispute and the determination of the real

8

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

controversy between the parties should be permitted at any stage from

the commencement of trial to final judgment, so long as any resulting

prejudice or injustice could be cured by costs, can no longer be regarded

as good law.

The administration of justice today extends beyond the resolution of

disputes between individual parties. The modern conception of justice

emphasises fairness and access to justice for all, rather than justice for

one at the expense of many. A significant backlog of cases exists at every

level of the judicial hierarchy. The concept of effective case management

has gained global recognition as essential to the proper functioning of

the justice system. When cases are repeatedly postponed and allowed to

stagnate, effective case management is undermined, the efficiency of the

entire system is compromised, and access to justice is ultimately denied.

Access to justice is a cornerstone of the rule of law. If undue delays and

procedural inefficiencies are allowed to persist, the erosion of public

confidence in the legal system becomes inevitable.

Whether in superior Courts or original Courts, there is no doubt that

litigants must be afforded a fair hearing, but the Court cannot afford, in

my view, an unlimited hearing. We must understand that the demands

and exigencies of contemporary justice are fundamentally different from

those that prevailed decades ago. Litigants are not entitled to unfettered

use of judicial time, as other litigants await their turn. This shift reflects

the current trend across all major jurisdictions, which I will discuss

further under the subheading Global Trends.

Amendment of pleadings before accepting the plaint or answer

Once the plaint or answer is filed, the Court may, ex mero motu, return

it for amendment without accepting it. Sections 46 and 77 of the Civil

Procedure Code are relevant in this regard.

Section 46 deals with when a plaint can be returned for amendment or

rejected by the Court.

9

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

46(1) Every plaint presented by a registered attorney on behalf of a

plaintiff shall be subscribed by such registered attorney. In every

other case in which a plaint is presented, it shall be subscribed by

the plaintiff; and his signature shall be verified by the signature of

some officer authorized by the court in that behalf.

(2) Before the plaint (whether presented by the plaintiff or by a

registered attorney in his behalf) is allowed to be filed, the court

may, if in its discretion it shall think fit, refuse to entertain the same

for any of the following reasons, namely:-

(a) if it does not state correctly, and without prolixity, the several

particulars hereinbefore required to be specified therein;

(b) if it contains any particulars other than those so required;

(c) if it is not subscribed, or subscribed and verified, as the case may

be, as hereinbefore required;

(d) if it does not disclose a cause of action;

(e) if it is not framed in accordance with section 33;

(f) if it is wrongly framed by reason of non-joinder or misjoinder of

parties, or because the plaintiff has joined causes of action which

ought not to be joined in the same action;

and may return the same for amendment then and there, or within

such time as may be fixed by the court, upon such terms as to the

payment of costs occasioned by the amendment as the court thinks

fit;

Provided that no amendment shall be allowed which would have

the effect of converting an action of one character into an action of

another and inconsistent character;

And provided further, that in each of the following cases, namely:-

(g) Where the relief sought is undervalued, and the plaintiff, on being

required by the court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed

by the court, fails to do so;

10

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

(h) Where the relief sought is properly valued, but the plaint is

written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff on being

required by the court to supply the requisite stamps within a time to

be fixed by the court fails to do so;

(i) When the action appears from the statement in the plaint to be

barred by any positive rule of law;

(j) When the plaint having been returned for amendment within a

time fixed by the court is not amended within such time;

(k) When the plaint is not accompanied by such number of

summonses as there are defendants;

the plaint shall be rejected; but such rejection shall not of its own

force preclude the plaintiff from presenting a fresh plaint in respect

of the same cause of action.

Section 77 deals with when an answer can be returned for amendment

or rejected without accepting it.

77. If any answer is substantially defective in any of the particulars

hereinbefore defined, or is argumentative or prolix, or contains

matter irrelevant to the action, the court may, by an order to be

endorsed thereon, reject the same or return it to the party by whom

it was made, for amendment within a period not exceeding one

month from the date on which the answer was so returned, and the

court may impose such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks

fit.

If the answer is rejected or left unamended as ordered, the

defendant shall be regarded as having failed to file answer.

The order so endorsed shall specify the ground of the rejection.

Amendment of pleadings before the case is fixed for pre-trial

Section 93(1) applies when an application to amend pleadings is made

by a party before the day first fixed for pre-trial of the action or, as

11

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

amended by Act No. 29 of 2023, before the day first fixed for pre-trial

conference of the action.

According to section 93(1), Upon application made to it before the day

first fixed for pre-trial conference of the action, in the presence of, or after

reasonable notice to all the parties to the action, the court shall have full

power of amending in its discretion, all pleadings in the action, by way of

addition, or alteration, or of omission.

Once pleadings are accepted, the Court cannot, ex mero motu, amend

pleadings. Only a party to the action may make such an application, in

the presence of, or with reasonable notice to, all other parties to the

action. The Court must first hear the parties before making a decision.

It may not be irrelevant to emphasise that, notwithstanding section 93(1)

stating that the Court shall have full power of amending in its discretion

all pleadings in the action before the day first fixed for pre-trial

conference of the action, this discretion is not unfettered. The judge must

act reasonably and not arbitrarily. The following observation made by

Lord Wrenbury in Roberts v. Hopwood [1925] AC 578 at 613 aptly

summarises the standard expected in the exercise of discretion:

A person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion

upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to

do what he likes merely because he is minded to do sohe must in

the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought.

In other words, he must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and

follow the course which reason directs. He must act reasonably.

According to section 93(3), any application for amendment of pleadings

which may be allowed by the Court under subsection (1) or (2) shall be

upon such terms as to costs and postponement or otherwise as the Court

may think fit. The phrase otherwise as the court may think fit empowers

the Court to allow the amendment without costs, depending on the facts

and circumstances in which the application is made.

12

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

As a general rule, the Court shall adopt a liberal approach when

considering applications to amend pleadings before the day first fixed for

pre-trial conference of the action, bearing in mind its duty (a) to facilitate

the presentation of the real dispute or disputes in controversy between

the parties and (b) to prevent a multiplicity of actions arising from the

same set of facts.

At this stage, amendments that serve only to clarify or define the real

issue or issues between the parties will readily be granted. (Hatton

National Bank Ltd v. Whittal Boustead Ltd [1978-79] 2 Sri LR 257,

Abeywardena v. Euginahamy [1984] 2 Sri LR 231, Wijesinghe v.

Karunadasa [1987] 2 Sri LR 179)

In Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal v. K.K. Modi (2006) 4 SCC 385, the Supreme

Court of India stated: It is settled by catena of decisions of this Court that

the rule of amendment is essentially a rule of justice, equity and good

conscience and the power of amendment should be exercised in the larger

interest of doing full and complete justice to the parties before the Court.

In terms of section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code, every action shall

include the whole of the claim to which the plaintiff is entitled on the

cause of action. Actions cannot be filed on a piecemeal basis.

According to section 75(e), if the defendant sets up a claim in

reconvention in the answer, it shall have the same effect as a plaint.

As a general principle, new causes of action arising after the institution

of the action, even if they stem from the same transaction, cannot be

accommodated. This is due to the general rule that the rights of the

parties are determined at the time of the institution of the action. (Hatton

National Bank v. Silva [1999] 3 Sri LR 113) However, as with most rules,

exceptions may apply. An amendment that introduces a new cause of

action arising from the same transaction may be allowed prior to the day

first fixed for pre-trial conference of the action, provided it does not alter

the fundamental character of the action and remains within the

13

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

framework of the law, bearing in mind that the policy of the Civil

Procedure Code is to avoid multiplicity of actions. In Grace De Alwis v.

Walter De Alwis (1971) 76 NLR 444, it was held that The statement in

the judgment of a divisional bench in Lebbe v. Sandanam (64 N.L.R. 461)

that in no circumstances can a new cause of action be added when a plaint

is amended was made obiter and is now not followed.

However, the Court is not bound to grant the amendment solely because

it was sought before the pre-trial conference but must consider the

nature of the application.

Amendments made mala fide, in abuse of the process of Court, with the

sole intention of prolonging proceedings, and thereby gaining an unfair

advantage, must not be permitted.

Amendments that introduce entirely new causes of action and new

positions, altering the fundamental character of the action cannot be

allowed. For example, if a plaintiff initially files an action claiming

damages for breach of the contract and later seeks to amend the plaint

to claim damages based on fraud arising from the same transaction,

such an amendment, which introduces a new cause of action, would

alter the fundamental character of the case and would therefore be

impermissible.

The first proviso to section 46 of the Civil Procedure Code states:

Provided that no amendment shall be allowed which would have the

effect of converting an action of one character into an action of another and

inconsistent character.

Amendments that would prejudice defences such as a plea of

prescription are not permitted. (Weldon v. Neal (1887) 19 Q.B.D. 394,

Hall v. Meyrick [1957] 2 Q.B. 455, Waduganathan Chettiar v. Sena Abdul

Cassim (1952) 54 NLR 185) For instance, a plaintiff files an action on

01.01.2023 for breaches of a written contract that occurred on

01.01.2018. Under section 6 of the Prescription Ordinance, since the

14

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

cause of action prescribes within six years, the claim is within time.

However, if the plaintiff in 2025 seeks to amend the plaint to introduce

a new claim based on a breach of the same contract that occurred on

01.01.2017, which was within time when the action was filed but is now

prescribed, the amendment cannot be permitted, as allowing such an

amendment would deprive the defendant of the defence of prescription.

This is because, when pleadings are amended, they are deemed to relate

back to the date of the original plaint or answer. In Lucihamy v. Hamidu

(1923) 26 NLR 41 at 43-44, Bertram C.J. stated:

It has been settled both by local and by English decisions that when

an amended plaint or statement of claim is filed, it is considered for

all purposes as relating back to the date of the original plaint or

statement of claim. In Weldon v. Neal (1887) 19 Q.B.D. 394 an

amendment of a statement of claim was disallowed, on the ground

that it sought to include fresh claims which at the time of the

amendment was barred by the Statute of Limitations, although not

barred at the date of the writ. Lord Esher M.R. said: If an

amendment were allowed setting up a cause of action, which, if the

writ were issued in respect thereof at the date of the amendment,

would be barred by the Statute of Limitations, it would be allowing

the plaintiff to take advantage of her former writ to defeat the statute

and taking away an existing right from the defendant, a proceeding

which, as a general rule, would be, in my opinion, improper and

unjust. We have the converse case in our own books (see Morris v.

Dias (1892) 2 C.L.R. 185). In that case, after the institution of an

action on a promissory note, the plaint was amended by the

addition of an alternative count for goods sold and delivered. It was

there held that the period of limitation must be reckoned up to the

date of the original summons, and not up to the date of the

amendment. This new cause, said Withers J., relates back to the

date of the original writ.

15

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

Amendments that would result in grave prejudice to the opposite party

shall not be permitted. The Court must weigh the potential irremediable

injustice that may arise from refusing the amendment against the

substantial prejudice that may be occasioned to the opposing party if it

is allowed. Where the latter outweighs the former, the Court shall

exercise its discretion to refuse the amendment. For instance, if an

amendment seeks to introduce a material factual assertion that was not

pleaded in the original plaint, or to withdraw an important admission

already made in the original pleading, thereby nullifying or undermining

the defence raised in the answer, such an amendment would cause grave

prejudice to the opposing party and cannot be permitted.

Addition, deletion, misjoinder and nonjoinder of parties and causes

of action

It may also be relevant to note that section 18, which permits the

addition or deletion of parties, section 22, which addresses misjoinder

and non-joinder of parties, and sections 35 to 38, which govern the

misjoinder of causes of action, are all closely linked to the amendment of

pleadings.

While the addition or deletion of parties could previously be made at any

time before the hearing, the amendment Act No. 29 of 2023 now permits

such applications to be made only on or before the day first fixed for the

pre-trial conference. Section 18(1) reads as follows:

The court may on or before the day first fixed for the pre-trial

conference, upon the application of either party, and on such terms

as the court thinks just, order that the name of any party, whether

as plaintiff or as defendant improperly joined, be struck out; and the

court may at any time, either upon or without such application, and

on such terms as the court thinks just, order that any plaintiff be

made a defendant, or that any defendant be made a plaintiff, and

that the name of any person who ought to have been joined, whether

as plaintiff or defendant, or whose presence before the court may be

16

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

necessary in order to enable the court effectually and completely to

adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in that action,

be added.

Section 21 makes it mandatory to amend the plaint once a defendant is

added after the institution of the action. Section 21 reads:

Where a defendant is added, the plaint shall, unless the court

directs otherwise, be amended in such manner as may be

necessary, and a copy of the amended plaint shall be served on the

new defendant and on the original defendants.

The objections as to misjoinder or nonjoinder of parties shall be taken

before the day first fixed for pre-trial conference. Section 22 enacts as

follows:

All objections for want of parties, or for joinder of parties who have

no interest in the action, or for misjoinder as co-plaintiffs or co-

defendants, shall be taken at the earliest possible opportunity, and

in all cases before the day first fixed for pre-trial conference. And

any such objection not so taken shall be deemed to have been

waived by the defendant.

Sections 35 to 38 deal with misjoinder of causes of action. Section 35

reads as follows:

35(1) In an action for the recovery of immovable property, or to obtain

a declaration of title to immovable property, no other claim, or any

cause of action, shall be made unless with the leave of the court,

except-

(a) claims in respect of mesne profits or arrears of rent in respect of

the property claimed;

(b) damages for breach of any contract under which the property or

any part thereof is held; or consequential on the trespass which

constitutes the cause of action; and

17

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

(c) claims by a mortgagee to enforce any of his remedies under the

mortgage.

Example:- A sues B to recover land upon the allegation that the land

belongs to C, and that he A, has bought it of C. A makes C a party

defendant; but he cannot, without leave of the court, join with this

claim an alternative claim for damages against C for non-

performance of his contract of sale.

(2) No claim by or against an executor, administrator, or heir, as

such, shall in any action be joined with claims by or against him

personally unless the last-mentioned claims are alleged to arise

with reference to the estate in respect of which the plaintiff or

defendant sues or is sued as executor, administrator, or heir, or are

such as he was entitled to or liable for jointly with the deceased

person whom he represents.

Section 36 allows the Court to separate causes of action.

36(1) Subject to the rules contained in the last section, the plaintiff

may unite in the same action several causes of action against the

same defendant or the same defendants jointly, and any plaintiffs

having causes of action in which they are jointly interested against

the same defendant or defendants may unite such causes of action

in the same action.

But if it appears to the court that an such causes of action cannot be

conveniently tried or disposed of together, the court may, at any time

before the hearing, of its own motion or on the application of any

defendant, in both cases either in the presence of, or upon notice to,

the plaintiff, or at any subsequent stage of the action if the parties

agree, order separate trials of any such causes of action to be had,

or make such other order as may be necessary or expedient for the

separate disposal thereof.

18

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

(2) When causes of action are united, the jurisdiction of the court as

regards the action shall depend on the amount or value of the

aggregate subject-matter at the date of instituting the action,

whether or not an order has been made under the second paragraph

of subsection (1).

In terms of sections 37 and 38, separation of causes of action can be

done upon the application of the defendant.

37. Any defendant alleging that the plaintiff has united in the same

action several causes of action, which cannot be conveniently

disposed of in one action, may at any time before the hearing apply

to the court for an order confining the action to such of the causes of

action as may be conveniently disposed of in one action.

38(1) If, on the hearing of such application, it appears to the court

that the causes of action are such as cannot all be conveniently

disposed of in one action, the court may order any of such causes of

action to be excluded, and may direct the plaint to be amended

accordingly, and may make such order as to costs as may be just.

(2) Every amendment made under this section shall be attested by

the signature of the Judge.

Until sections 36, 37 and 38 are amended in line with the legislative

intent to make any amendment before the day first fixed for pre-trial

conference, these sections shall be read with section 93. As I have

already emphasised, amendments are not permitted after the day first

fixed for pre-trial conference of the action, unless the requirements under

section 93(2) are fulfilled.

Amendment of pleadings after the case is fixed for pre-trial

conference

Where an amendment was sought on or after the date the case was first

fixed for pre-trial of the action (as provided under Act No. 8 of 2017) or

19

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

for pre-trial conference of the action (as the law now stands under Act

No. 29 of 2023), the discretion of the Court was, and continues to be,

significantly curtailed.

Let me first make it clear that there is a difference between the day first

fixed for pre-trial conference of the action and the day the case is first

taken up for pre-trial conference of the action. What is contemplated in

section 93(2) is the former, not the latter.

Section 93(2), as presently constituted, reads as follows:

On or after the day first fixed for pre-trial conference of the action

and before final judgment, no application for the amendment of any

pleadings shall be allowed unless the Court is satisfied, for reasons

to be recorded by the Court, that grave and irremediable injustice

will be caused if such amendment is not permitted, and on no other

ground, and that the party so applying has not been guilty of laches.

Under section 93(2), on or after the day first fixed for pre-trial conference

of the action and before final judgment, no application for amendment of

any pleadings shall be allowed:

(a) unless the Court is satisfied,

(b) for reasons to be recorded by the Court,

(c) that grave and irremediable injustice will be caused if such

amendment is not permitted,

(d) and on no other ground,

(e) and that the party so applying has not been guilty of laches.

As section 93(2) presently stands, the Court must be satisfied that a

grave and irremediable injustice is inevitable if the amendment is not

allowed. The injustice must not be a mere injustice, but one that is both

grave and irremediable. Whether this threshold is met will depend on the

specific facts and circumstances of the case. However, even if such grave

and irremediable injustice is bound to occur, the Court should not allow

20

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

the amendment if the party seeking the amendment is guilty of laches.

Both requirements shall be met, not one of them. It must also be

emphatically emphasised that the law expressly prohibits allowing

amendments on any other ground.

In the oft-quoted case of Gunasekera v. Abdul Latiff [1995] 1 Sri LR 225

at 232, Ranaraja J. stated:

The amendments to pleading on or after first date of trial can now

be allowed only in very limited circumstances. It prohibits court from

allowing an application for amendment at this stage unless (1) it is

satisfied that grave and irremediable injustice will be caused if the

amendment is not permitted, and (2) the party applying has not been

guilty of laches. On no other ground, can court allow an application

for an amendment of pleadings. Furthermore, court is obliged to

record reasons for concluding that the two conditions referred to

have been satisfied.

In reference to section 93(2), in the case of Kuruppuarachchi v. Andreas

[1996] 2 Sri LR 11 at 13, G.P.S. De Silva C.J. stated:

While the Court earlier discouraged amendment of pleadings on the

date of trial, now the court is precluded from allowing such

amendments save on the ground postulated in the subsection.

Laches

Laches is an equitable defence that precludes relief where there has been

an unreasonable and unexplained delay in asserting a claim. Rooted in

the equitable maxim equity aids the vigilant, not the indolent, the

doctrine seeks to uphold fairness in litigation by ensuring that parties do

not suffer undue hardship due to the inaction of others.

The term laches has been defined in several renowned legal

dictionaries.

21

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

Blacks Law Dictionary, 11th edition, page 1046:

Laches. [Law French remissness; slackness] (14c) 1.

Unreasonable delay in pursuing a right or claim almost always an

equitable one in a way that prejudices the party against whom

relief is sought. also termed sleeping on rights.

Prosecution laches. (1977) Patents. In a claim for patent-

infringement, the equitable defense that the patentee did not timely

enforce the patent rights.

2. The equitable doctrine by which a court denies relief to a claimant

who has unreasonably delayed in asserting the claim, when that

delay has prejudiced the party against whom relief is sought. Cf.

LIMITATION (3).

The doctrine of lachesis an instance of the exercise of the

reserved power of equity to withhold relief otherwise regularly given

where in the particular case the granting of such relief would be

unfair or unjust. Willim F. Walsh Treatise on Equity 472 (1930).

Chambers 20th Century Dictionary (1983), page 704:

Negligence or undue delay, esp. such as to disentitle to remedy.

Anglo-French lachesse.

K.J. Aiyars Judicial Dictionary, 11th Edition 1992, page 673:

Slackness, negligence in pursuing a legal remedy whereby the party

forfeits the benefits upon the principle vigilantibus non dormientibus

jura subveniunt. [Whartons Law Lexicon, 1976 Reprint Ed. at 562].

Strouds Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases, 8th Edition 2017, Vol

2, page 1571:

LACHES. Laches, or lasches, is an old French word for slacknessse

or negligence, or not doing (Co. Litt. 380B; see also Co. Litt. 246B;

22

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

Termes de la Ley; Cowel); that definition was cited and applied by

North J., Partridge v. Partridge [1894] 1 Ch. 351.

Laches is a neglect to do something which by law a man is obliged

to do (per Ellenborough C.J., Sebag v. Abitbol, 4 M. & S. 463).

Mozley and Whiteleys Law Dictionary, 10th Edition 1988, page 260:

Laches. Slackness or negligence. In general, it means neglect in a

person to assert his rights, or long and unreasonable acquiescence

in the assertion of adverse rights. This neglect or acquiescence will

often have the effect of barring a person from the remedy which he

might have had if he had resorted to it in proper time. Thus, under

the Limitation Act 1980, the time is specified within which various

classes of actions respectively mentioned in it may be brought.

Independently of this statute, a court of equity will often refuse relief

to a plaintiff who has been guilty of unreasonable delay in seeking

it.

The Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Aiyar, 1995, page 698:

Laches, or lasches, is an old French word for slackness or

negligence, or not doing (Co. Litt. 380b, Terms de la Ley).

Laches in law is a neglect to do something which by law a man is

obliged to do (per Ellenborough, C.J., Sebag v. Abitbol, 4 M. & S.

463). In a general sense it means a neglect to do what in the law

should have been done for an unreasonable or unexplained length

of time under circumstances permitting diligence.

Laches to bar the plaintiffs right must amount to waiver,

abandonment, or acquiescence and to raise a presumption of any of

these, the evidence of conduct must be plain and unambiguous. (32

Bom. 234 and 33 Cal. 633, Ref. 95 I.C. 636=1926 Nag. 416)

23

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

What would be laches in one case might not constitute such in

another. The question is one addressed to the sound discretion of

the court, depending upon all the facts of the particular case.

It must be emphasised that mere delay, however prolonged, does not per

se amount to laches. In other words, laches cannot be determined solely

by reference to the length of time taken to make the application. The

relevant question is not how many months or years have elapsed since

the application ought to have been madefor instance, in this case, how

much time has passed since the case was first fixed for pre-trial

conference to move for an amendment of the answerbut whether the

delay is unreasonable and unjustifiable in the context of the particular

case. As Mark Fernando J. observed in Lulu Balakumar v. Balasingham

Balakumar [1997] BLR 22, the circumstances of the particular case, the

reason for the delay, and impact of the delay on the other party, must all

be taken into account. Similarly, Sharvananda J. (as he then was), in

Biso Menika v. Cyril de Alwis [1982] 1 Sri LR 368 at 379, stated: What

is reasonable time and what will constitute delay will depend upon the

facts of each particular case. Where the delay is satisfactorily explained,

relief ought not to be refused on the ground of laches.

Negligence v. Mistake

It follows that a party will not be able to explain the delay to the

satisfaction of the Court if he has been negligent, careless, imprudent,

failed to exercise due diligence, or displayed similar conduct. It need

hardly be emphasised that the term party extends to and includes his

Attorney-at-Law.

In Packiyanathan v. Singarajah [1991] 2 Sri LR 205, a strong Bench of

this Court comprising Mark Fernando J., Amarasinghe J. and Kulatunga

J. held at 213 that where the default has resulted from the negligence of

the Attorney-at-Law in which event the principle is that the negligence of

the Attorney-at-Law is the negligence of the client and the client must

suffer for it.

24

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

In this context, I must refer to the Supreme Court Rules of 1988, made

under Article 136(1)(g) of the Constitution concerning the conduct and

etiquette of Attorneys-at-Law, and published in Gazette Extraordinary

No. 535/7 dated 07.12.1988, which remain in force to date.

Rule 10 thereof reads as follows:

An Attorney-at-Law shall not accept any professional matter unless

he can attend to it with due diligence.

Rule 15 reads as follows:

On accepting any professional matter from a client or on behalf of

any client, it shall be the duty of an Attorney-at-Law to exercise his

skill with due diligence to the best of his ability and care in the best

interests of his client in such manner as he may decide and he

should do so without regard to any unpleasant consequences either

to himself or to any other person. Furthermore he should at all times

so act with due regard to his duty to Court, Tribunal or any

Institution established for the Administration of Justice before which

he appears and to his fellow Attorneys-at-Law opposed to him.

Lord Griffiths, sitting in the House of Lordsthe highest Appellate Court

in the United Kingdom prior to the establishment of the Supreme Court

in 2009observed in Ketteman v. Hansel Properties [1987] AC 189:

Another factor that a judge must weigh in the balance is the

pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in litigation and

the consequent necessity that, in the interests of the whole

community, legal business should be conducted efficiently. We can

no longer afford to show the same indulgence towards the negligent

conduct of litigation as was perhaps possible in a more leisured age.

There will be cases in which justice will be better served by allowing

the consequences of the negligence of the lawyers to fall upon their

25

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

own heads rather than by allowing an amendment at a very late

stage of the proceedings.

Nonetheless, I must hasten to add that to err is humanwhether made

by the client or the Attorney-at-Lawand mistakes may occur despite

the exercise of due diligence and meticulousness. Depending on the

particular facts and circumstances of the case, a mistake may, though

not as a matter of course, be excused if the other requisite conditions are

met. This, however, does not extend to instances of negligence,

carelessness, or similar lapses.

As Millett L.J. in Gale v. Superdrug Stores PLC [1996] 1 WLR 1089 at

1098E stated:

The administration of justice is a human activity, and accordingly

cannot be made immune from error. When a litigant or his advisor

makes a mistake, justice requires that he be allowed to put it right

even if this causes delay and expense, provided that it can be done

without injustice to the other party.

This principle was explained in Packiyanathan v. Singarajah (supra) as

follows at page 213:

However, it is necessary to make a distinction between mistake or

inadvertence of an Attorney-at-Law or party and negligence. A mere

mistake can generally be excused; but not negligence, especially

continuing negligence. The decision will depend upon the facts and

circumstances of each case; and where the conduct of Counsel is

involved the Court will, in granting relief, ensure that its order will

not condone or in any manner encourage the neglect of professional

duties expected of Attorneys-at-Law.

However, not every error can be categorised as a mistake. A mistake is

an unintentional act or omission made in good faith, arising from an

honest misunderstanding or misapprehension of fact. Negligence, on the

26

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

other hand, denotes a failure to exercise due diligence or the standard of

care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise under similar

circumstances, resulting in foreseeable harm. In other words,

foreseeable harm cannot be justified on the basis of mistake.

Foreseeable harm

In the case of Gunasekera v. Latiff (supra), Ranaraja J. referring to the

observation made by Amarasinghe J. in Ranaweera v. Jinadasa (S.C.

Appeal 41/91) that No postponements must be granted, or absence

excused, except upon emergencies; occurring after the fixing of the date,

which could not have been anticipated or avoided with reasonable

diligence, and which cannot otherwise be provided for, stated at page 236

that The provisions of section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code are

intended to be used when amendments to pleadings are necessitated by

unforeseen circumstances.

The principle laid down in Ranaweeras case when applied to the

facts of the present case would clearly deny the petitioners the right

to plead absence of laches. They will be hard put to satisfy any court

that they were taken by surprise or the error could not have been

discovered earlier with reasonable diligence. The petitioners

conduct points to one conclusion alone. That is, they have acted

without due diligence. The delay on their part to detect the error

deprives them of the right to amend their answer at the time they

applied to do so. The provisions of section 93(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code are intended to be used when amendments to

pleadings are necessitated by unforeseen circumstances. They

should not be applied in circumstances as disclosed in the present

case.

This dictum of Ranaraja J. that the provisions of section 93(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code are intended to be used when amendments to pleadings

are necessitated by unforeseen circumstances has been consistently

followed in later cases including but not limited to Colombo Shipping Co.

LR 309, Kanagaraj v. Alankara [2010] 1 Sri LR 185). I am in respectful

agreement with that view.

In Kuruppuarachchi v. Andreas (supra) at page 13, G.P.S. De Silva C.J.

concluded:

Turning now to the averments in the amended answer, it is clear

that the defendant was well aware of the fact that the plaintiff was

living in adultery at the time the answer was filed, but she has

chosen not to rely on that ground in her answer. After the second

date of trial, she is seeking to amend the answer by including a

cause of action based on adultery. In these circumstances, the

conclusion of the Court of Appeal, that the defendant is guilty of

laches and that the amended answer has to be rejected in terms of

section 93(2) (as amended) must be affirmed.

In reference to the submission of counsel for the defendant that the

defendant refrained from pleading adultery in her answer as she wished

to preserve the marriage in the interest of the children, the Chief Justice,

at page 14, observed:

Her intentions were no doubt laudable and deserving of sympathy,

but if such a plea is admissible the purpose of the amendment

would, to a great extent, be defeated.

The law is now settled that the provisions of section 93(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code are intended to address amendments to pleadings after

the day first fixed for pre-trial conference of the action, arising from

unforeseen circumstances.

28

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

In Archlane Ltd v. Johnson Controls Ltd [2012] EWHC B12 (TCC), the

High Court of Justice of England and Wales refused permission for an

amendment ten weeks before the trial, inter alia, on the ground that there

was no reason why the relevant evidence could not have been obtained,

and the application to amend made, at an earlier stage. Edwards-Stuart

J. observed that the fact that the defendant was the author of its own

misfortune was a relevant factor in deciding whether to grant the

amendment:

because to the extent that the First Defendant will suffer prejudice

by the refusal of this amendment, which I accept is a clear

possibility, it seems to me clear also that it is very substantially the

author of that prejudice. The reality is that nothing has changed

since the original incident and there appears to be nothing that has

been discovered now that could not have been discovered three

years ago.

Finally, I must emphasise that when an application for amendment of

pleadings is made after the day first fixed for pre-trial conference of the

action, in addition to fulfilling the conditions set out in section 93(2), the

party seeking the amendment must also satisfy the general requirements

applicable to an application made before the day first fixed for pre-trial

conference of the action. For instance, amendments made: (a) mala fide,

with the sole intention of prolonging the proceedings; (b) to introduce

entirely new causes of action and positions, thereby altering the

fundamental character of the action; (c) that would defeat a plea of

prescription; and (d) that would result in grave prejudice to the opposing

party, shall not be permitted. (Gunasekera v. Abdul Latiff (supra) at 234)

Role of the Judge

The overarching purpose of pleadings is to present the case of each party

with clarity, thereby affording the opposing party an opportunity to

respond appropriately and enabling the Court to ascertain the precise

29

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

matters in dispute, with a view to securing their resolution, whether by

settlement or through trial.

Odgers Principles of Pleadings and Practice, 18th Edition (1963), page 74-

75 states:

The function of pleadings then is to ascertain with precision the

matters on which the parties differ and the points on which they

agree; and thus to arrive at certain clear issues on which both

parties desire a judicial decision. In order to attain this object, it is

necessary that the pleadings interchanged between the parties

should be conducted according to certain fixed rules. The main

purpose of these rules is to compel each party to state clearly and

intelligibly the material facts on which he relies, omitting everything

immaterial, and then to insist on his opponent frankly admitting or

explicitly denying every material matter alleged against him. By this

method they must speedily arrive at an issue. Neither party need

disclose in his pleading the evidence by which he proposes to

establish his case at the trial. But each must give his opponent a

sufficient outline of his case.

Every pleading must, inter alia, concisely state the material facts in

summary form and must not contain evidence or legal argument. If a

pleading is unduly prolix, it becomes difficult for both the opposite party

and the Court to identify the real issues in dispute. In such

circumstances, the Court is empowered, under sections 46 and 77 of the

Civil Procedure Code, to return the pleading for amendment or to reject

it altogether, if the amendment is not effected within the time fixed by

the Court.

The refusal of an amendment to pleadings does not bring the matter to

a close. What is of primary importance is not the pleadings themselves,

but the proper identification of the issues in dispute between the parties.

30

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

In terms of section 79B(a) of the Civil Procedure Code, the parties are

required to tender their proposed admissions and issues of fact and law

in writing to the registry of the Court, not less than thirty days before the

date first fixed for the pre-trial conference, and after giving notice thereof

to all other parties with proof of service. Once the issues are settled, the

pleadings recede into the background. In terms of section 142F, it is the

duty of the Courtnot the Attorneys-at-Lawto determine the issues at

the pre-trial conference by considering the pleadings, proposed

admissions and issues of the parties, interrogatories, documents,

agreements between the parties, and any reports submitted to Court.

Although it has always been the law that the duty of framing issues rests

with the District Judge, in practice, difficulties were frequently

encountered by Judges in identifying the issues at trial. However, with

the introduction of comprehensive provisions for pre-trial conference

under the Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, No. 29 of 2023, such

difficulties can no longer serve as a valid excuse. As I observed in

Sanjeewa Fernando v. Perera and Another (2024/25 BLR 265 at 274):

In terms of section 142A of the Civil Procedure Code, the main

purpose of a pre-trial conference is to facilitate a settlement between

the parties. The pre-trial conference is not another procedural step

in a civil case such as filing the answer or calling the case in open

Court to fix a date for trial. It is also a mistake to assume that the

purpose of a pre-trial conference is to lay a solid foundation for a

full-blown trial. In terms of section 142A(2), it is the peremptory duty

of each District Judge conducting the pre-trial conference to make

every effort to persuade the parties to reach a settlement of the

dispute. A Judge conducting a pre-trial conference must actively

take part in the process, rather than being a passive observer or

umpire. Settlement is the norm and fixing the case for trial is the

exception. The Judge shall fix the case for trial, if, and only if, all

settlement efforts fail. In the event the case is fixed for trial, the

Judge must limit the trial to the real issue or issues between the

31

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

parties, as identified by the Judge himself. In accordance with

section 142F, the Judge shall determine the issue or issues by

considering the pleadings, proposed admissions and issues of the

parties, interrogatories, documents, agreements of the parties, and

reports, if any, submitted to the Court during the pre-trial

conference. Although the Judge may, of course, seek the assistance

of lawyers, the Judge cannot delegate this judicial function to them.

There is one further matter I wish to address concerning the amendment

of pleadings in the context of the provisions relating to the pre-trial

conference. It may be contended that a party who failed to make an

application to amend the pleadings before the day first fixed for pre-trial

conference of the action may nevertheless seek such amendment under

section 142H(a)(i) at the pre-trial conference. This position is untenable.

Section 142H(a)(i) cannot override section 93(2), which is couched in

mandatory terms. The provisions of a statute must be interpreted and

applied harmoniously, as a cohesive whole, in order to give effect to the

purpose and intent of the legislature.

Global trends

When compared with other common law jurisdictions, it is evident that

Sri Lanka adopts a more stringent approach to the amendment of

pleadings. However, recent global trends indicate a gradual shift in the

same direction.

The traditional view of the English Courts, which was followed in our

jurisdiction in a bygone era, is encapsulated in the oft-quoted dictum of

Bowen L.J. in Cropper v. Smith (1884) 26 Ch.D. 700 at 710711, where

he observed:

it is a well established principle that the object of courts is to decide

the rights of the parties, and not to punish them for mistakes they

make in the conduct of their cases by deciding otherwise than in

accordance with their rights .... I know of no kind of error or mistake

32

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

which, if not fraudulent or intended to overreach, the court ought not

to correct, if it can be done without injustice to the other party. Courts

do not exist for the sake of discipline, but for the sake of deciding

matters in controversy, and I do not regard such amendment as a

matter of favour or grace.... It seems to me that as soon as it appears

that the way in which a party has framed his case will not lead to

a decision of the real matter in controversy, it is as much a matter

of right on his part to have it corrected, if it can be done without

injustice, as anything else in the case is a matter of right.

In contrast, recent decisions of the Courts in England reflect a stricter

approach to amendment of pleadings, rejecting applications not only on

the grounds of prejudice or injustice to the opposing party but also on

broader considerations of procedural discipline, effective case

management, and the overall efficiency of the justice system.

In England, the modern approach finds clear reflection in the decision of

the Court of Appeal in Worldwide Corporation Ltd v. GPT Ltd [1998] EWCA

Civ 1894, where Lord Bingham L.C.J., Peter Gibson L.J., and Waller L.J.,

after examining a series of authorities, emphasised the importance of

overall justice over individual justice. The Court held that the interests

of all Court users must be safeguarded, underscoring that when cases

stagnate unnecessarily without timely resolution, the overall efficacy of

the judicial process is compromised.

[I]n previous eras it was more readily assumed that if the amending

party paid his opponent the costs of an adjournment that was

sufficient compensation to that opponent. In the modern era it is

more readily recognised that in truth the payment of the costs of an

adjournment may well not adequately compensate someone who is

desirous of being rid of a piece of litigation which has been hanging

over his head for some time, and may not adequately compensate

him for being totally (and we are afraid there are no better words

for it) mucked around at the last moment. Furthermore, the courts

33

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

are now much more conscious that in assessing the justice of a

particular case the disruption caused to other litigants by last

minute adjournments and last minute applications have also to be

brought into the scales.

Every sore in litigation cannot be healed by costs. Trial judges must be

afforded the discretion to manage their trial roll effectively.

The appreciation of the injustice to other litigants and the damage

to parties in trials being delayed which cannot adequately be

compensated by an order for costs has led the court to a more

interventionist approach in the management of trials, and has

furthermore led to appellate courts being very reluctant to interfere

with decisions of judges who with all those interests in mind have

taken decisions at interlocutory stages.

Consequently, in refusing the plaintiffs applications to amend their

points of claim and to furnish additional particulars for their quantum

meruit claim (a principle permitting recovery for work or services

rendered in the absence of a formal contract) Waller L.J. held:

Where a party has had many months to consider how he wants to

put his case and where it is not by virtue of some new factor

appearing from some disclosure only recently made, why, one asks

rhetorically, should he be entitled to cause the trial to be delayed so

far as his opponent is concerned and why should he be entitled to

cause inconvenience to other litigants? The only answer which can

be given and which, Mr Brodie has suggested, applies in the instant

case is that without the amendment a serious injustice may be done

because the new case is the only way the case can be argued, and

it raises the true issue between the parties which justice requires

should be decided.

We accept that at the end of the day a balance has to be struck. The

court is concerned with doing justice, but justice to all litigants, and

34

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

thus where a last minute amendment is sought with the

consequences indicated, the onus will be a heavy one on the

amending party to show the strength of the new case and why

justice both to him, his opponent and other litigants requires him to

be able to pursue it.

While the above judgment was decided before the enforcement of the Civil

Procedure Rules in 1998, its alignment with the Rules and its overriding

objective was recognised by Rix L.J. in Savings & Investment Bank Ltd v.

Fincken [2003] EWCA Civ 1630 at paragraph 79 as follows:

As a postscript I would add that, although decided prior to the

introduction of the CPR and concerned with an egregious application

to change direction in the course of trial itself, the judgment of this

court in Worldwide Corporation Ltd v. GPT Limited contains a full

compendium of citation of authorities as at that date which

emphasises that, even before the CPR, the older view that

amendments should be allowed as of right if they could be

compensated in costs without injustice had made way for a view

which paid greater regard to all the circumstances which are now

summed up in the overriding objective.

Notable decisions which have followed suit include Swain-Mason v. Mills

& Reeve LLP [2011] EWCA Civ 14 and Nesbit Law Group LLP v. Acasta

European Insurance Co Ltd [2018] EWCA Civ 268.

In MGN Pension Trustees Limited v. Invesco Asset Management Ltd &

Others [1993] Lexis Citation 3019, the Court of Appeal in England

refused leave to appeal against a decision by the trial Judge who

disallowed an amendment to the pleadings. Henry L.J. observed:

In a case such as this the trial judges task is not only judicial but

also managerial. The managerial responsibility is considerable,

with the overall costs budget in millions. Consequently, that function

is very important in an age where litigation of all sorts at every level

35

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

is too expensive because unnecessarily long. So judges are not only

entitled but encouraged to be pro-active in their trial management

and interlocutory appeals are consequently discouraged.

Likewise, the High Court of Australia, in the seminal case of AON Risk

Services Australia Ltd v. Australian National University (2009) 239 CLR

175, departed from the previously liberal approach to late amendments

of pleadings and adopted a more restrictive stance. In that case, the

plaintiff sought an adjournment on the third day of trial to file an

amended statement of claim, thereby expanding its claim against the

defendant, its insurance broker, for fire damage. In considering the

factors relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion in permitting belated

amendments, the Court emphasised the necessity of providing a cogent

explanation for any delay in seeking an amendment, stating as follows:

The importance attached by r 21 to the factor of delay will require

that, in most cases where it is present, a party should explain it. Not

only will they need to show that their application is brought in good

faith, but they will also need to bring the circumstances giving rise

to the amendment to the courts attention, so that they may be

weighed against the effects of any delay and the objectives of the

Rules.

Despite the absence of specific statutory provisions in Australia

expressly recognising the need for expedition in Court procedure relating

to amendments, it was stressed that judicial practice has evolved to

address concerns of undue delay and inefficiency, guided by

considerations of the public interest:

The Judicature Act Rules (Judicature Act 1873 (UK) amended by the

Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 (UK)) and their Australian

offspring did not in terms make reference to the public interest in the

expeditious dispatch of the business of the courts. The way in which

proceedings progress has been left to the parties. This may be seen

as an aspect of the adversarial system which is a dominant part of

36

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

the common law inheritance of Judicature Act procedure. In this

respect, however, the adversarial system has been qualified by

changing practices in the courts directed to the reduction of costs

and delay and the realisation that the courts are concerned not only

with justice between the parties, which remains their priority, but

also with the public interest in the proper and efficient use of public

resources.

The Judicature Acts and associated Rules of Court are reflected in

rr 501 and 502 of the ACT (Australian Capital Territory) Rules. The

ACT Rules, like their precursors, confer the discretion to give leave

to amend and impose the duty to make amendments for the purpose

of deciding the real issues in, and avoiding multiplicity of,

proceedings. The discretion is exercised in the context of the common

law adversarial system as qualified by changing practice. But that

is not a system which today permits disregard of undue delay.

Undue delay can undermine confidence in the rule of law. To that

extent its avoidance, based upon a proper regard for the interests of

the parties, transcends those interests. Another factor which relates

to the interests of the parties but transcends them is the waste of

public resources and the inefficiency occasioned by the need to

revisit interlocutory processes, vacate trial dates, or adjourn trials

either because of non-compliance with court timetables or, as in this

case, because of a late and deliberate tactical change by one party

in the direction of its conduct of the litigation. These are matters

which, even under the Australian versions of the Judicature Act

system, unaffected by the sequelae of the civil procedure reforms of

1998 in the United Kingdom, are to be regarded as both relevant

and mandatory considerations in the exercise of the discretion

conferred by rules such as r 502.

This transition in judicial approach in Australia, aimed at addressing

delays and costs in the litigation process, was recognised as early as

2000 by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report Managing

37

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

Justice: A Review of the Federal Civil Justice System, Report No. 89 at

[6.3].

Comparatively, the law in South Africa reflects a markedly

accommodative attitude regarding amendments to pleadings. The Court

has the discretion to grant leave to amend any pleading or document at

any stage before judgment, notwithstanding any contrary provisions in

the Rules, subject to the Courts power to impose terms as it deems fit,

including those related to costs or other matters.

In spite of this, the Court in Randa v. Radopile Projects CC 2012 (6) SA

128 (GSJ), in deviating from the previous approach, laid the groundwork

for the development of a more balanced exercise of the Courts

jurisdiction in allowing late amendment of pleadings by taking into

account the reasons for delay, the conduct of the litigants, and any

injustice incapable of being compensated for by costs.

The case involved a monetary claim by the respondent in terms of a

building dispute, wherein the appellant later sought to amend his plea

and counterclaim in order to inter alia increase the quantum of damages.

Bava A.J., having regard to the absence of a satisfactory explanation for

the delay and the appellants negligent conduct in contributing to the

undue protraction of proceedings, refused to grant leave to amend. In

articulating the rationale behind this approach, Willis J. highlighted the

increasing inconvenience caused by delays associated with amendments:

It has long been my conviction that the commencement of a trial is

the fulcrum upon which the courts stance in respect of applications

for amendments to pleadings should be balanced. The further away

the parties are from the commencement of the trial, the easier it

should be for a litigant to obtain an amendment and, conversely, the

deeper the parties are into trial and the nearer they may be to

obtaining judgment, the more difficult it ought to be.

38

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

I am fortified in this conviction by reference to Halsburys Laws of

England (4th Edition (Reissue) Volume 36 (1) paragraph [1]) in which

it is stated that the function of pleadings is to

enable the parties to decide in advance of the trial what

evidence will be needed. From the pleadings the appropriate

method of trial can be determined.

Furthermore, as litigants approach a trial and, even more so, once a

trial commences, costs increase exponentially; there are not

infrequently considerable logistical difficulties in securing the

timeous attendance of witnesses at court. As the trial progresses,

the court hearing the matter will have begun to form impressions of

witnesses and develop a sense the direction in which the wind may

be blowing. These factors mitigate against the more relaxed or

liberal attitude that may prevail before trial.

These developments across jurisdictions reflect a growing recognition

that belated applications for amendment of pleadings can undermine

timely justice and burden the system. The emphasis is increasingly on

balancing individual fairness with the effective functioning of the justice

system, reinforcing the principle that access to justice includes not only

the right to be heard, but also the right to timely resolution.

Applicability of the law to the facts of the case

At the material time to this appeal, amendment Act No. 8 of 2017 was in

operation.

It is undisputed that the 1st and 2nd defendants made the application to

amend the pleadings on the day first fixed for the pre-trial of the action.

Therefore, the applicable provision is section 93(2), not section 93(1).

By examining the written submissions filed before the District Court, it

is evident that the 1st and 2nd defendants advanced two main arguments

39

SC/APPEAL/100/2020

before the District Court in support of their application to amend the

pleadings.

Firstly, they contended that since the case was not fixed for trial, section

93(1) was applicable. This contention is manifestly erroneous, as section

93(1) cannot be invoked when an application for amendment is made on

or after the date first fixed for pre-trial.

Secondly, they argued that there is a conflict of interest between the 1st

and the 2nd defendants, and that unless they are permitted to file

separate answers clearly articulating their respective positions, a grave

injustice would be caused to them.

The purported conflict of interest and grave injustice were foreseeable

at the time the 1st and 2nd defendants chose to file a joint answer, joint

admissions and issues, and a joint list of witnesses and documents, at

three separate occasions after deliberations. In any event, if they had

really intended to amend the joint answer and file separate answers, they

ought to have made the application for amendment of pleadings before

the date the case was first fixed for the pre-trial, not on the date the case

was taken up for pre-trial.

The High Court did not appreciate both the law and the facts of the case.

It appears that the High Court proceeded on the basis that the

amendments would not surprise the plaintiff and therefore could be

permitted. I am surprised that the High Court did not consider the

applicability of section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code at all.

I unhesitatingly answer the question of law on which leave to appeal was

granted in the affirmative. Accordingly, the judgment of the High Court

dated 09.01.2020 is set aside, and the judgment of the District Court

dated 28.11.2018 is restored. The appeal is allowed with costs.

As agreed, the parties in SC/APPEAL/101/2020 will abide by this

judgment.
