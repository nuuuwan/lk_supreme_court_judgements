The Dharmachakra or the \u2018Wheel of Dharma\u2019 [ ], containing a hub, eight radial spokes, and a rim, is a sacred symbol primarily associated with Buddhism. It represents Lord Buddha\u2019s teachings and the path proclaimed by him to be necessary to reach the cessation of the recurrence of life. Buddhists believe that it signifies the turning of the wheel of truth and the continuous cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, which Lord Buddha had preached, should be breached in order to end suffering and the recurrence of life. He had preached that it can be achieved by following the noble eightfold path, which is founded upon ethical and spiritual principles contained in the Dhamma (Lord Buddha\u2019s teachings). The Dharmachakra is a symbolic visual representation of that noble eightfold path. It is said to represent Lord Buddha\u2019s first sermon to his first set of disciples, titled the Dharma Chakra Pavathvana Suthra. The Dharmachakra is recognized as the symbol of Buddhism across all major Buddhist traditions, namely Theravada, Mahayana, and Va-jrayana. The Dharmachakra is prominently featured in the national emblem of the Dem-ocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. It appears at the crest of the emblem, symbolizing the country\u2019s deep-rooted Buddhist heritage and the requirement for governance ac-cording to Buddhist principles. It is also found at the apex of the emblem of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and is prominently displayed in the body of the emblem of the Sri Lanka Police together with its motto \u201cDhammo Havei Rakkhathi Dhamachari\u201d (\u201cThe one who lives by the Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma.\u201d). In India, the Dharmachakra is a pro-found symbol of spiritual law, moral governance, and national identity, associated with the mythical universal benevolent king Chakravarthi. It is also prominently featured as the Ashoka Chakra of Emperor Ashoka (3rd century BCE) and is embedded in the centre of India\u2019s national flag. Thus, quite understandably, the Dharmachakra is held sacred in the Indian sub-continent and is deeply respected by Buddhists world over. 15.

This duty stems from Article 12, which confers equality to all persons, from which the principle of parity of status can be derived.

Possibly due to sheer ignorance stemming from a lack of education, the Petitioner had engaged in conduct that ultimately brought her considerable inconvenience, distress, and infringement of her Fundamental rights.
