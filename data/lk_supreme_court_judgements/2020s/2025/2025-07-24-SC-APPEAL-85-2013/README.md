One Ranpatipura Dewage Lukshman Fernando died intestate. Mahipala

Dharmasiriwardenege Soidahamy, widow of the deceased (the original Petitioner -

Administrator), applied to the District Court of Kurunegala for the letters of

administration. Originally, there were five respondents named in the petition, which

later increased to nine. The parties entered into a settlement agreeing to the grant of

letters of administration to Soidahamy and the distribution of the estate.

Page 8 of 15

After the issue of the letters of administration to Soidahamy, there were several claims

made by debtors against the estate. The total of these claims was about Rs. 29,000/=

whereas the amount lying to the credit of the application was Rs. 4940.35. The value

of the properties left by the deceased was around Rs. 68,000/=.

Soidahamy sought the leave of Court to sell four of the lands to settle the debtors.

Only three of those properties were sold and it is claimed that the said sale was done

with the permission of Court. Subsequently, Soidahamy sought permission from the

court to sell the 4th land described in the inventory and the court granted permission

on 03.12.1980. The sale took place on 17.02.1981 and the said land was purchased by

Soidahamy.

Thereafter, the administrator Soidahamy died, and the letters of administration was

re-issued to R.D. Sirisena, the 4C SubstitutedAdministrator-Respondent-Respondent.

Objections were filed against the aforesaid second sale but the learned District Judge

confirmed the sales by order dated 27.02.1991 (A 16).

The 4A Respondent-Respondent-Respondent aggrieved by the said order appealed to

the Court of Appeal which was rejected on 09.12.1994 in terms of Rule 13(b) of the

Supreme Court (Court of Appeal Appellate Procedure Copies of Records) Rules 1978.

On 05.07.1995, the learned District Judge, who succeeded the learned District Judge

who delivered the Order marked A 16, called for a Registrar's Report regarding the

entire case. With the filing of the said Registrar's Report, the learned District Judge

called for the Inventory and the Final Accounts. On 22.11.1995, the District Judge fixed

for consideration of the Final Accounts and Inventory.

On 21.04.1998 the learned District Judge delivered order holding that the earlier sales

of the lands was not legal and that all of those properties should go to the deceased's

heirs.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Appellant-Appellants

appealed to the Court of Appeal.

Page 9 of 15

At the same time, 1st and 2nd Respondent-Appellant-Appellants filed a revision

application to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the revision

application holding that the petitioner has not discharged the burden of satisfying the

court that there are compelling reasons why the court should exercise its discretionary

jurisdiction through Revision.

Thereafter, the Court of Appeal took up the appeal filed by the 1st and 2nd Respondent-

Appellant-Appellants and dismissed it. Court of Appeal held that the impugned

judgment/order cannot be said to have attracted the qualification of a final

order/judgment which is capable of finally disposing the matter in litigation.

Accordingly, Court held that no appeal lies against the impugned order.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Appellant-

Appellants applied and obtained leave to appeal on the following questions of law:

1. Does the impugned order of the District Court dated 25th April 1998 [A-26] has

the effect of setting aside the order made by a previous District Judge marked

A-16 at page 315 of the brief and the Judgment in D.C. Kurunegala Case No.

4726/L/94 at pages 530 to 548 of the brief, and if so, do the said Order marked

A-16 and the Judgment in D.C. Kurunegala case No. 4726/L operate as Res

Judicata?

2. Did the District Court err in law in holding that Sales effected by the

Administrator were done illegally and those properties should go to the heirs

of the deceased intestate?

3. Did the Court of Appeal err in law and in fact in holding that, there is no right of

appeal against the impugned Order of the District Court dated 21st April, 1998

in terms of Sec. 744 of the Civil Procedure Code?

Question of law Nos. 1 and 2 will arise for consideration only if the answer to question

of law No. 3 is in the affirmative. As such, I shall first consider question of law No. 3.

Page 10 of 15

I must state at the outset that the Court of Appeal did not make any reference to

Section 744 of the Civil Procedure Code. In fact, the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Appellant-

Appellants contended that this was never raised before the Court of Appeal. However,

leave to appeal has been granted on this question and I must therefore address this

contention.

Section 744 of the Civil Procedure Code states that every order or decree made under

the provisions of Chapter LV shall be subject to an appeal to the Court of Appeal. This

chapter deals with the accounting and settlement of the estate. None of the provisions

therein provide for the setting aside by the District Court of the sale of lands which

have been confirmed by the District Court by order dated 27.02.1991(A 16). Moreover,

the appeal preferred by the 4A Respondent-Respondent-Respondent against the said

order A16 was also dismissed by the Court of Appeal.

Accordingly, I hold that the impugned order is not one made under the provisions of

Chapter LV of the Civil Procedure Code and hence Section 744 of the Civil Procedure

Code does not assist the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Appellant-Appellants.

In these circumstances, the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Appellant-Appellants must

establish that the impugned order is a judgment within the meaning of Section 754(1)

read with Section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code in order to maintain this appeal.

Let me initially set out the development of the relevant principles in English law as our

law was developed on those principles.

The English Courts have adopted two tests, which were referred to as order approach

test and application approach test by Sir John Donaldson MR in White v.

Brunton[(1984) 2 All ER 606], to determine whether an order or judgment is final or

interlocutory for the purpose of the relevant English Rules.

The application approach appears to have been adopted in Standard Discount Co. v.

La Grange [(1877) 3 C.P.D. 67] where Lord Esher held (at page 67) that if the decision

Page 11 of 15

given in one way will finally dispose of the matter in dispute, was given the other way

to allow the action to go on, then it is not a final but interlocutory order.

In Salaman v. Warner and Others [(1891) 1 QB 734 at 735] Lord Esher M.R., further

clarified the application approach test for determining the question as follows:

The question must depend on what would be the result of the decision

of the Divisional Court, assuming it to be given in favour of either of the

parties. If their decision, whichever way it is given, will, if it stands, finally

dispose of the matter in dispute, I think that for the purposes of these

rules it is final. On the other hand, if their decision, if given in one way,

will finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other, will

allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final, but interlocutory.

Fry, L. J., expounded the same test in the following words (at page 736):

I conceive that an order is final only where it is made upon an

application or other proceeding which must, whether such application or

other proceeding fail or succeed, determine the action. Conversely I think

that an order is interlocutory where it cannot be affirmed that in either

event the action will be determined. Applying this test to the present

case, it is obvious that the order here was made on an application of

which the result would not in one event be final. Therefore this is an

interlocutory order."

Lopes L. J., enunciated the same test thus (at page 736):

"I think that a judgment or order would be final within the meaning of

the rules, when, whichever way it went, it would finally determine the

rights of the parties."

The decision in Salaman (supra.) was adopted with approval in White (supra.).

Page 12 of 15

The order approach appears to have been adopted in Shubrook v. Tuffnell [(1882) 9

QBD 621] where it was held that an order is final, if it finally determines the matter in

litigation. In Bozson v. Altrincham Urban District Council [(1903) 1 KB 547 at 548] Lord

Alverstone, C.J., proceeded to lay down the order approach test as follows:

It seems to me that the real test for determining this question ought to

be this: Does the judgment or order, as made, finally dispose of the rights

of the parties? If it does, then I think it ought to be treated as a final order,

but if it does not, it is then, in my opinion, an interlocutory order".

Several English decisions adopted the order approach enunciated in Bozson (supra.)

[See Isaacs & Sons v. Salbstein and Another (1916) 2 K. B. 139, 147, Haron bin Mohd

Zaid v. Central Securities (Holdings) Bhd (1982) 2 All ER 481].

Hence, the order approach test considers only the nature of the order made. If the

order, taken in isolation, finally disposes of the rights of the parties in litigation without

leaving the suit alive, the order is final and a direct appeal lies as of right. In Rank Xerox

(Singapore) Pte Ltd. v. Ultra Marketing [(1991) 2 SLR (R) 912] it was held that the

phrase the rights of the parties contained in Bozson (supra.) referred to the

substantive rights in dispute in the particular action in which the summary judgment

application was made.

On the contrary, in the application approach test, the focus is on the nature of the

application made to Court and not the order delivered per se. If the order given in one

way finally disposes the matter in litigation, but if given in the other way will allow the

action to continue, the order is interlocutory and not final. According to this approach,

the order will be final only where, whichever way it is given, the order finally

determines the rights of the parties in the litigation.

Page 13 of 15

In Salter Rex & Co. v. Ghosh [(1971) 2 All ER 865] Lord Denning MR having considered

the two tests held (at page 866):

Lord Alverstone CJ was right in logic but Lord Esher MR was right in

experience. Lord Esher MR's test has always been applied in practice. For

instance, an appeal from a judgment under RSC Ord 14 (even apart from

the new rule) has always been regarded as interlocutory and notice of

appeal had to be lodged within 14 days. An appeal from an order striking

out an action as being frivolous or vexatious, or as disclosing no

reasonable cause of action, or dismissing it for want of prosecution

every such order is regarded as interlocutory: see Hunt v Allied Bakeries

Ltd [1956]3 All ER 513, [1956] 1 WLR 1326. So I would apply Lord Esher

MRs test to an order refusing a new trial. I look to the application for a

new trial and not to the order made. If the application for a new trial

were granted, it would clearly be interlocutory. So equally when it is

refused, it is interlocutory. It was so held in an unreported case, Anglo-

Auto Finance (Commercial) Ltd v Robert Dick, and we should follow it

today.

In Siriwardena v. Air Ceylon Ltd. [(1984) 1 Sri.LR. 286] the Supreme Court adopted the

order approach advocated by Lord Alverstone C.J. in Bozson (supra.) in determining

whether an order was interlocutory or a final. However, later in Ranjit v.

Kusumawathie and Others [(1998) 3 Sri.L.R. 232] the Court adopted the application

approach advocated in Salman (supra.) and Salter Rex (supra.). A fuller bench in S. R.

Chetttiar and Others v. S. N. Chettiar [(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 70] and Dona Padma Priyanthi

Senanayake v. H. G. Chamika Jayantha and two others [(2017) BLR 74] reviewed all

the previous decisions and held that the application approach test must be applied to

ascertain whether an order or judgment is interlocutory or final.

Applying the application approach test to the impugned order, I hold that it is an

interlocutory order. The substantive rights of the parties in the main application were

Page 14 of 15

never determined by the impugned order. As the Court of Appeal correctly held, the

substantive rights of the parties were determined when the parties entered into terms

of settlement in 1970 and 1972. This constitutes the judgment of this action. It clearly

lays down as to who should be issued the letters of administration, the parties who

should be treated as the intestate heirs of the deceased and the extent to which the

widow is entitled to the properties under Kandyan Law. Hence the settlement entered

into between the parties has the effect of pronouncing final judgment in this action.

All other proceedings are ancillary to the final judgment.

Upon an application of the application approach test, it is clear that in any action, there

can be only one final judgment which is liable to a direct appeal. All other orders are

ancillary to the final judgment and can be appealed only with leave first obtained. This

approach has the utility of ensuring that actions do not get delayed due to final appeals

been lodged against ancillary orders.

In an application for grant of letters of administration as in this action, the type of

orders that can be made are set out in Section 534 of the Civil Procedure Code. A

judgment made thereunder will be the final judgment in such proceedings which is

liable to a direct appeal. In this action, that came about in the form of settlement

between the parties as explained above.

I must add in passing that had I concluded that the impugned order was one made

under Section 744 of the Civil Procedure Code, the question of applying the application

approach test will not arise. In Barbara Iranganie de Silva and Another v. Hewa

Waduge Indralatha [(2017) BLR 68] it was held that the ratio in Chettiar (supra) has

no application when the language of a statute is clear and the right of appeal is given

in express terms. In Believers Church v. Paneer Selvam Jenita Enriya [S.C. No.

SC/HCCA/LA 184/2023, S.C.M. 12.03.2024] I have examined this aspect and agreed

with the reasoning in Barbara Iranganie de Silva and Another (supra).

For all the foregoing reasons, I answer question of law No. 3 in the negative. Hence

there is no need to answer questions of law Nos. 1 and 2.

Page 15 of 15

The Court of Appeal was correct in dismissing the appeal filed by the 1st and 2nd

Respondent-Appellant-Appellants. I affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal dated

04.10.2010.

Appeal is dismissed.

In all the circumstances of the case, I make no order as to costs.
