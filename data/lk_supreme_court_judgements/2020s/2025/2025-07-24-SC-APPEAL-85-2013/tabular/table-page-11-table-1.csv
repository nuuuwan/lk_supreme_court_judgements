"In Salaman v. Warner and Others [(1891) 1 QB 734 at 735] Lord Esher M.R., further"
"clarified the application approach test for determining the question as follows:"
"“The question must depend on what would be the result of the decision"
"of the Divisional Court, assuming it to be given in favour of either of the"
"parties. If their decision, whichever way it is given, will, if it stands, finally"
"dispose of the matter in dispute, I think that for the purposes of these"
"rules it is final. On the other hand, if their decision, if given in one way,"
"will finally dispose of the matter in dispute, but, if given in the other, will"
"allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final, but interlocutory.”"
