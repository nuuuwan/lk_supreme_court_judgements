"","knowledge or consent but held that the alteration was not material because it"
"","was procedural in nature and did not alter the fundamental obligations under"
"","the guarantee."
"[18]","As Cresswell J explained:"
"","“The contract of guarantee (and indemnity) with cl. 37 completed would not"
"","have operated differently from the guarantee in its original form (with cl. 37"
"","containing  blanks).  The  legal  incidence  of  the  contract  of  guarantee  (and"
"","indemnity) was not altered by the insertions into cl. 37. The business effect of"
"","the contract of guarantee (and indemnity), if used for any ordinary business"
"","purpose for which a contract of guarantee (and indemnity) is used, was not"
"","altered by the insertion into cl. 37. The alteration was not, in the context of this"
"","guarantee (and indemnity), material.”"
"[19]","Similarly,  in  the  present  case,  the  typewritten  particulars  inserted  into  the"
"","guarantee bond after signature do not fall within either category of “material"
"","alteration.” They did not change the nature or character of the instrument. The"
"","bond remained what it was at execution, a guarantee by the Appellant to answer"
"","the  obligations  of  the  1st  Defendant  under  the  lease.  No  new  debtor  was"
"","substituted,  no  new  creditor  was  introduced,  and  the  scope  of  the  obligation"
"","was not changed, nor were these insertions prejudicial to the guarantor’s legal"
"","rights  or  obligations.  The  typewritten  parts  had  only  specified  procedural  or"
"","administrative details necessary for the operation of the bond."
"[20]","For  the  forgoing  reasons,  the  alterations  complained  of  do  not  constitute"
"","“material”  alterations.  The  Appellant’s  fundamental  obligation  remained  the"
"","same,  and  his  rights  as  guarantor  were  not  diminished.  The  guarantee  bond"
"","therefore remains valid and enforceable."
