"","such subsequent insertions to be the date of execution of the guarantee bond,"
"","the  reference  number  of  the 
lease  agreement,  the  personal  details  of  the"
"","guarantors  (entered  below  their  respective  signatures),  and  the  name  and"
"","address of the lessee."
"[10]","However, it is crucial to note that none of these particulars were pleaded by the"
"","Appellant to be false or to amount to a misrepresentation."
"[11]","In support of his claim, the Appellant relied on the testimony of the Plaintiffâ€™s"
"","witness, Belan Daminda who conceded that the blank spaces in the guarantee"
"","agreement were completed after the 3rd Defendant had placed his signature."
"[12]","The 3rd Defendant-Appellant, in his testimony, stated that at the time he signed"
"","the guarantee bond, the document contained only the printed part and alleged"
"","that the typewritten part was inserted later. He takes up the position that, by"
"","leaving  blank  spaces  in  the  guarantee  bond  to  be  filled  later,  the  lender  has"
"","made a fundamental mistake which makes the agreement void."
"[13]","However, it is noted that any subsequent insertion ipso facto would not render"
"","a contract unenforceable, but rather enforceability would be determined by the"
"","nature of the alteration and the knowledge or consent of the executing party. A"
"","contract  can  be  vitiated  where  the  insertion  constitutes  a  material  alteration"
"","that fundamentally changes the obligations undertaken, or where the signature"
"","was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation."
"[14]","In the present case, it is not disputed that the Appellant executed the guarantee"
"","as  surety  of  the  1st  Defendant  under  the  lease  agreement.  The  nature  of  that"
"","obligation remained constant, irrespective of the fact that the particulars were"
"","subsequently filled. The Appellant is a literate businessman, and has not alleged"
"","that  his  signature  was  obtained  by  fraud  or  duress  by  the  Respondent.  His"
"","evidence  was  that  he  signed  the  printed  form  knowing  it  to  be  a  guarantee."
