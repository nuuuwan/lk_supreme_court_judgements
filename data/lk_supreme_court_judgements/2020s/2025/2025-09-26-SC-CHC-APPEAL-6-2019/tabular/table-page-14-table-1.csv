"[33]","Although the Appellant did not expressly plead the defence of non est factum,"
"","the  learned  trial  Judge  in  the  above  observation  appears  to  have  treated  the"
"","Appellant’s claim to be similar to the defence “non est factum” meaning a plea"
"","denying execution of the instrument sued on or signing a document by a person"
"","without  knowing  its  contents.  I  am  of  the  view  that  this  was  an  appropriate"
"","application  of  the  principle  by  the  learned  High  Court  Judge.    This  plea  is"
"","primarily available to persons who are illiterate, sick, or incapacitated. It can"
"","also  extend 
to  an  executor  of  a  document  presumed 
to  have  read  and"
"","understood the document before its execution; however, by proving that it was"
"","not the document the executor intended to sign, or that it was obtained by fraud"
"","or force."
"[34]","Regarding  the  usage  of  this  principle,  Paget  on  Law  of  banking  states  as"
"","follows3:"
"","“The doctrine is now rarely invoked successfully, and negligence in failing to"
"","ascertain  the  meaning  of  the  document  can  prevent  its  application.  So  in"
"","Saunders  v  Anglia  Building  Society,  an  elderly  widow  failed  to  read  a"
"","document  which  she  executed  in  the  belief  that  it  was  a  deed  of  gift  of  a"
"","property to her nephew, when in fact it was an assignment to a third party."
"","The House of Lords rejected a plea of non est factum in a dispute between the"
"","claimant widow and a lender who had innocently lent money on the strength"
"","of  the  document.  The  claimant  had  known  that  she  was  signing  a  legal"
"","document, and although she was mistaken as to its terms, she had not taken"
"","the trouble to read it so as to ascertain even its general effect.”"
