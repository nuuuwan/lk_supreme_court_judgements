"[35]","Prof. C.G. Weeramantry in ‘Law of Contracts’ states as follows:"
"","“A person signing a document is held strictly to its terms on the basis that he"
"","does so at his peril. This is known as the caveat subscriptor rule, and in the"
"","operation  of  this  rule  the  principles  relating  to  justus  error  come  into  play."
"","This rule must not however be viewed as a special head of exemption from the"
"","ordinary  rules  relating  to  mistake.  Where  a  person  deliberately  affixes  his"
"","signature to a written contract, the court would naturally be more hesitant in"
"","permitting him to plead that he did so in consequence of a mistake as to the"
"","nature or substance of the transaction, and to this extent would be less prone"
"","to view the error as justus.”4"
"[36]","I  also  wish  to  echo  the  opinion  of  A.H.M.D.  Nawaz,  J,  in  the  judgement  of"
"","Nimalasena vs. L.B. Finance Company Ltd and others5 where he held that;"

"","tradesman on his own admission. The witness came through as a man of the"
"","world who could not have been so naive as to be unaware of the implications"
"","of placing one's signature to a guarantee. If he knew that the act of signing a"
"","guarantee would spell for him disastrous consequences of monetary burdens,"
"","he should have exhibited prudence. So his assertion that he only signed as a"
"","witness and not as a guarantor does not inspire confidence in this Court. The"
"","necessity to exercise prudence was emphasized by the House of Lords in the"
"","context of the plea of non est factum.”"
"[37]","The guarantors have not pleaded fraud or force when obtaining signatures, or"
"","that 
the 
signatures  were  placed  unintentionally  or  without  a  complete"
"","understanding  of 
the 
implications.  The  nature  and
