"[29]","As  explained  above,  the  law  does  not  require  that  the  lease  agreement  be"
"","translated 
for 
the 
guarantor, 
it 
is 
sufficient 
that  he  understands  his"

"","1.3  
Analysis"
"[30]","The 3rd Defendant-Appellant takes up the position that he is not liable to pay"
"","the  demanded  sum  since  the  guarantee  bond  was  incomplete  at  the  time  he"
"","placed his  signature.  The  Appellant  also  contends  that  due  to  his  inability  to"
"","read and understand the English language, he required a Sinhala translation of"
"","the Agreement, which was not given to him. Under cross-examination, the 3rd"
"","Defendant-Appellant  refers  to  certain  numbers  in  document  P8,  which  he"
"","claims include the typewritten parts."
"[31]","The Respondent was obligated to  explain to the guarantors  the nature of the"
"","transaction and the liability imposed on them in the event the principal debtor"
"","defaults. It is evident that the 3rd Defendant-Appellant, as guarantor, was aware"
"","of the amount he was liable to pay to the lessor in the event of any default of"
"","payment of the obligated sum."
"[32]","The Judge of the Commercial High Court, in the overall analysis of the evidence,"
"","concluded that the 3rd Defendant-Appellant was aware that he signed P8 as a"
"","guarantor to the 1st Defendant, that the 1st Defendant had defaulted on payment,"
"","that failure or neglect to pay the sum guaranteed or the return of “the property”,"
"","the liability was on the guarantor to pay its value on demand. The trial Judge"
"","observed  that,  although  the  3rd  Defendant-Appellant  claims  to  have  signed  a"
"","document  which  had  blank  spaces,  the  Appellant  was  admittedly  a  literate"
"","businessman owning a trading business and was not under any incapacity or"
"","disability, such as blindness or deafness, to be misguided."
