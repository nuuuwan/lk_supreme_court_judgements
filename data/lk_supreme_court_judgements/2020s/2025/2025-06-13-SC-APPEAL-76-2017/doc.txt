The plaintiff, who was a passenger at the time of the accident, instituted

this action in the District Court of Moratuwa against the 1st defendant, the

driver of the private bus in which the plaintiff was travelling, and the 2nd

defendant, the registered owner of the said bus, seeking compensation in a

sum of Rs. 3,000,000 for the injuries sustained in the accident, alleging

that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the 1st defendant. The

cause of action against the 2nd defendant was based on vicarious liability.

Notwithstanding that summons had been duly served on the 1st defendant,

he did not appear to contest the action, and the matter proceeded to ex

parte trial against him. In his answer, the 2nd defendant admitted that the

1st defendant was his employee and that the accident occurred in the course

of the employment. However, his position was that the accident was caused

due to the negligence of the driver of the other bus involved in the collision.

At the trial, the plaintiff testified, and medical evidence was also led to assist

in determining the quantum of compensation.

SC/APPEAL/76/2017 3

The judgment of the District Court was delivered on 09.05.2006, holding

that the plaintiff had proved his case against the defendants on a balance

of probabilities, and that the 2nd defendant was vicariously liable for the

acts committed by the 1st defendant in the course of his employment. The

District Court accordingly awarded compensation to the plaintiff in a sum

of Rs. 1,500,000, together with interest and costs of the action, to be

recovered from the 1st and 2nd defendants jointly and/or severally.

The appeal filed by the 2nd defendant against the judgment of the District

Court was dismissed by the High Court of Civil Appeal by its judgment dated

22.09.2016.

The 2nd defendant is now before this court, challenging the judgment of the

High Court of Civil Appeal. The pivotal argument advanced by learned

counsel for the 2nd defendant–appellant is that the plaintiff failed to

establish that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the 1st

defendant. However, I am not inclined to accept that submission, having

regard to the facts and circumstances of this case.

In paragraph 4 of the plaint, the plaintiff stated as follows:

වර්ෂ 2001 පෙබරවාරි මස 19 වන දින ප ෝ ඊට ආසන්න දිනක 1 වන විත්තිකරු එකි

බව ප්‍රකාශ කර සිටි.

The 1st defendant did not contest this position.

In this regard, the 2nd defendant, in his answer, stated as follows:

ෙැමිණිල්පල් 4 වන පේදපේ දැක්පවන සම්ප්‍රකාශ ප්‍රිපෂ්ෙ කර සිටින පමම විත්තිකරු

කර සිටී.

The 2nd defendant did not give evidence, nor did he call any other witness

in support of his case.

In the cross examination of the plaintiff, the 2nd defendant produced V1, in

order to demonstrate that the police had filed a case in the Magistrate’s

Court against the driver of the other bus for negligent driving, that he had

pleaded guilty to the charge, and that a fine of Rs. 1,500 had been imposed

on him. This was not disputed by the plaintiff.

During cross-examination, learned counsel for the 2nd defendant further

suggested to the plaintiff as follows:

ප්‍ර: තවදුරටත්ත මට කියා සිටිනවා පමම අනතූර සිදු වුපන් තමා ගමන් කළ බස් රථපේ

උ: උත්තතරයක් නැත.

SC/APPEAL/76/2017 5

ප්‍ර: තමා පම් සිේධිය දැක්පක් නෑ කිේපවාත්ත රි පන්?

උ: ඔේ.

It is on this basis that learned counsel for the 2nd defendant argues that the

negligence of the 2nd defendant was not proved.

As this court held in LOLC Factors Limited v. Airtouch International (Pvt) Ltd

(SC/CHC/APPEAL/20/2015, SC Minutes of 03.04.2024), “In terms of

section 85(1), what the plaintiff is required to do at the ex parte trial is to lead

evidence to satisfy the court that he is entitled to the relief claimed; no higher

degree of proof is required. If there is no satisfactory evidence, the court shall

dismiss the plaintiff’s case.”

In De Silva v. De Silva (1974) 77 NLR 554 at 558 this court stated “The

evidence led in an ex parte trial is of the barest minimum”.

In the case of The Finance Company PLC v. Thushara and Others

(SC/CHC/APPEAL/5/2012, SC Minutes of 26.01.2017), this court held

that, in an ex parte trial, the plaintiff is only required to present evidence

on a prima facie basis, demonstrating the constituent elements of his cause

of action.

When determining whether or not burden of proof has been discharged

in an ex parte trial, it has to be kept in mind that, a Plaintiff who

adduces evidence at an ex parte trial is, usually, required to adduce

only such evidence as is necessary to establish his case on a prima

facie basis by establishing the constituent elements of his cause of

action. This is subject to the Court seeing no reason to doubt the

authenticity and bona fides of the evidence.

Merely because the driver of the other bus pleaded guilty to the charge of

negligent driving—knowing well that the court would impose only a nominal

fine of Rs. 1,500—the 1st defendant cannot be exonerated, particularly when

SC/APPEAL/76/2017 6

he did not contest the plaintiff’s assertion that he too was liable for negligent

driving.

It is true that the High Court, in its judgment, observed that “it is possible

to apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to the matter at hand in the

circumstances.” I am prepared to accept that this may not be an ideal case

for the application of that doctrine. However, it must be noted that the High

Court did not affirm the judgment of the District Court on that basis alone.

The High Court further stated as follows:

In fact when the plaintiff and the doctor who gave evidence on behalf

of the plaintiff were being cross examined the learned counsel put

questions relating to the injuries caused to the plaintiff. It appears that

neither questions nor suggestions put to the plaintiff on the basis that

the 1st defendant driver was driving the bus with due care to the

passengers including other vehicles driven on the road when the

accident took place other than tendering the document marked as V1

to show that the driver of the other bus had been charged before the

magistrate court. A perusal of that document reveals that the accused

in that case had pleaded guilty but it is not clear exactly to what charge

he had pleaded guilty enabling court to conclude that the accident

occurred entirely on the negligence of the driver of the other bus who

collided with the bus in which the plaintiff was travelling.

The issues raised by the 2nd defendant at the trial were as follows:

10. ෙැමිණිල්පල් සද න් අනතුර සිදු වුපේ උත්තතර ප්‍රකාශපේ 4 වන පේදපේ සද න් ෙරිදි

අංක 62-8026 දරණ බස් රථය ෙැදවූ රියදුරාපේ වරදක් නිසාද?

11. ඉ ත සද න් විසදිය යුතු ප්‍රශ්නයට ‘ඔේ’ යැයි ගරු අධිකරණපයන් පිළිතුරු ලැබුනප ාත්ත

පමම 2 වන විත්තිකරුට එපරහිව ෙැමිණිල්ල ෙවත්තවාපගන යා ැකිද?

12. පකපස් පවතත්ත ඉල්ලා ඇි අලාභ ඉතා අධිකද?

SC/APPEAL/76/2017 7

Even if issue No. 10 was answered in the affirmative, it does not necessarily

follow that the plaintiff’s action should have been dismissed by the District

Court. A motor traffic accident may occur due to the negligence of the

drivers of both vehicles involved in the collision. As previously noted, in the

present case, the 1st defendant, by failing to contest the plaintiff’s claim,

effectively accepted that he was, at the very least, partly responsible for the

accident.

The District Court was not incorrect in concluding that the 1st and 2nd

defendants were jointly and/or severally liable to pay the plaintiff a sum of

Rs. 1,500,000, together with interest and costs of the action.

It is regrettable that the plaintiff has been unable to recover this modest

sum for over 19 years, despite the judgment of the District Court having

been delivered as far back as May 2006.

A previous Bench of this Court granted leave to appeal on the following

questions of law:

1. Did the High Court err in applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to

the relevant accident?

2. Did the High Court err in law in holding that the onus was on the 2nd

defendant to establish that the 1st defendant exercised due care

towards the respondent at the time of the accident?

3. Did the High Court err in law in not considering that the negligence

of a third party caused the accident?

My answers to the above questions are as follows:

1. The High Court did not affirm the judgment of the District Court

solely on the basis of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.

2. The High Court did not affirm the judgment of the District Court

solely on that basis.

SC/APPEAL/76/2017 8

3. The High Court did consider the role of the third party in its judgment.

Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal with costs.
