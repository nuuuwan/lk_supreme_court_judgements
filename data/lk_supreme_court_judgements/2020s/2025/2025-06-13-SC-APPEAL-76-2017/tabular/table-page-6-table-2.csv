"Court did not affirm the judgment of the District Court on that basis alone."
"The High Court further stated as follows:"
"In fact when the plaintiff and the doctor who gave evidence on  behalf"
"of  the  plaintiff  were  being  cross  examined  the  learned  counsel  put"
"questions relating to the injuries caused to the plaintiff. It appears that"
"neither questions nor suggestions put to the plaintiff on the basis that"
"the  1st  defendant  driver  was  driving  the  bus  with  due  care  to  the"
"passengers  including  other  vehicles  driven  on  the  road  when  the"
"accident took place other than tendering the document marked as V1"
"to show that the driver of the other bus had been charged before the"
"magistrate court. A perusal of that document reveals that the accused"
"in that case had pleaded guilty but it is not clear exactly to what charge"
"he  had  pleaded  guilty  enabling  court  to  conclude  that  the  accident"
"occurred entirely on the negligence of the driver of the other bus who"
"collided with the bus in which the plaintiff was travelling."
