"32.  As it was stated in the Sierra Construction Ltd. v Road Development Authority and",""
"","others (supra), I am in complete agreement with my brother’s opinion that if each and"
"","every breach of law or a violation of a contractual right or a breach of contract cannot and"
"","should not be treated as a violation of a fundamental right. If that were so, this Court’s"
"","role in addressing the genuine violations would indeed be heavily diluted."
"33.  As was observed in Wijesinghe v. Attorney General and Others,14",""
"","“We  have 
to 
take  cognizance  of 
the  distinction  between  ordinary  rights  and"
"","fundamental rights, and it is only a breach of a fundamental right that calls for our"
"","intervention.  Every  wrong  decision  or  breach  of  the 
law  does  not  attract  the"
"","constitutional remedies relating to fundamental rights.”"
"34.","It is perhaps necessary for me to highlight at this juncture that, while the 1st Respondent"
"","is a corporation amenable to fundamental rights jurisdiction, such amenability does not"
"","make  this  a  one-size-fits-all  forum  to  bring  all  disputes  relating  to  such  corporation."
"","Enabling such a practice to continue could potentially open up floodgates, causing various"
"","claims associated with State corporations to flow through and clog the systems of this"
"","Court."
"35.  As such, for the reasons mentioned above, I am of the opinion that the circumstances of",""
"","this  matter  relate  merely  to  a  Commercial  Agreement  and  a  dispute  between  parties"
"","arising therefrom."
"36.","I refrain from making any declarations as to the contractual rights and obligations on the"
"","part of the Petitioners and the Respondents, for such is not the function of this Court in"
"","the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 126 of the Constitution."
