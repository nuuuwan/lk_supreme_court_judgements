SUBMISSIONS:

Respondent on 22nd August 2019 and on 17th June 2020

Petitioners on 23rd September 2019

ARGUED ON: 15th July 2025

DECIDED ON: 10th September 2025

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The Petitioners, namely, K.D. Chandrasekara (hereinafter the 1st Petitioner) and K.D.H.

Nadeeka Chandrasekara (hereinafter the 2nd Petitioner) are the Producer and the

Director of a Tele-drama named La Sanda Pamula ( &) (hereinafter the Tele-

drama) respectively.

2. By a Petition dated 6th July 2015, the Petitioners invoked this Courts jurisdiction, alleging

the violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1), 14(1)(a), 14(1)(g)

and 14A(1) of the Constitution pursuant to a decision of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini

Corporation (hereinafter the 1st Respondent) and the Chairman of Sri Lanka Rupavahini

Corporation (hereinafter the 2nd Respondent) to terminate the telecasting of the said

Tele-drama.

3. This Court granted leave to proceed on the alleged violation of Articles 12(1), 14(1)(a) and

14(1)(b) of the Constitution.

FACTUAL MATRIX

The Petitioners Narration of Events

4. The Petitioners state that they produced a Tele-drama after thorough research with the

purpose of improving the human values in society at large and particularly to develop the

habit of reading among the younger generation of the country. They had financed the

said production by their own savings, borrowings and by mortgaging their property. The

SC (F/R) 282/2015 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 11

final product included 60 episodes of 21 minutes each, and as per the Petitioners, the

total cost of the production had come to Rs. 8 million.

5. They had subsequently tendered the Tele-drama to several TV channels, including the 1st

Respondent, Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation.

6. After paying a preview fee of Rs. 12,000/- to the 1st Respondent, the Tele-drama was

previewed by a panel of previewers, and the 1st Respondent had been informed by a letter

dated 30th January 20131 that the Tele-drama was approved by the said panel. However,

in the same letter, the 1st and 2nd Respondents had informed the Petitioners that the said

Tele-drama will only be telecasted after finding a sponsor.

7. After approximately 1 years, the 1st Respondent had informed the Petitioners that the

Tele-drama could be telecasted at 9.00 p.m. from 4th August 2014. The Petitioners state

that they agreed to the 1st Respondents offer, despite the price offered per episode being

comparatively low. A trailer for the Tele-drama had also been aired, stating that the tele-

drama would be televised from the aforementioned date. The Respondent had done so

before signing any formal agreement.

8. Despite advertising, the 1st Respondent had not televised the Tele-drama on the 4th of

August 2014. The Petitioners have not received any reasons for such action. The

Petitioners state that, by the telecasting of the trailer on the 1st Respondents channel,

they were deprived of the opportunity to tender the Tele-drama to any other channel.

9. Thereafter, the Petitioners had managed to persuade the Respondents to telecast the

Tele-drama at 8.30 p.m. from 4th September 2014. No formal agreement had been signed

even at this juncture.

SC (F/R) 282/2015 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 11

10. The Petitioners allege that, thereafter, the Petitioners were compelled to accept the terms

and conditions put forward by the 1st to 3rd Respondents, although the Petitioners

considered the same to be unfavourable to them, and the Petitioners had accordingly

signed the Agreement No.8672 dated 5th September 2014 with the 1st Respondents.

11. Subsequent to the said Agreement, the 1st Respondent had commenced televising the

Tele-drama from 30th September 2014 at 8.30 p.m.

12. The 2nd Respondent, by a letter dated 15th May 2015,3 had tendered the notice for

termination of the aforesaid Agreement to the 2nd Petitioner and informed that the said

Agreement will be terminated with effect from 22nd May 2015 in terms of clause No. (1)

of the said Agreement.

13. Aggrieved by the said action of the 1st to 3rd Respondents, the Petitioners had sought

relief by writing letters to His Excellency the President, the Hon. Prime Minister and the

Hon. Minister of Mass Media and Information. The 2nd Petitioner, by a letter dated 18th

May 2015,4 addressed to the 2nd Respondent and to the other authorities, had

communicated and complained of their grievances arising out of the said unfair

termination. The Petitioners state that, although the said authorities directed the 2nd

Respondent to take appropriate actions, no such action was taken by any of the

Respondents.

14. Hence, the Petitioners had sought relief by complaining to the Human Rights Commission

on 15th June 20155. As per the Petitioners, viewers of this Tele-drama were also

disappointed by the sudden cancellation and signed an online petition to express their

views. On behalf of such viewers, one filed a complaint to the Human Rights Commission

on 12th June 20156.

15. After an inquiry, the Human Rights Commission had found the Petitioners fundamental

rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution to have been violated by the

Respondents and recommended to re-broadcast the Tele-drama7.

16. The Respondents have then complied with the recommendation of the Human Rights

Commission, by a decision of its Programme Committee dated 2nd November 2016,8 and

re-televised the Tele-drama beginning with episode 01 from February 2017.

17. The Petitioners contended during their submissions before this Court that the Petitioners

are entitled to compensation for the re-televised episodes as well.

The Respondents Position

18. The Respondents take up the position that, by the Agreement signed between the

Petitioners and the Respondents, the 1st Respondent bought the commercial and non-

commercial rights of the Tele-drama to transmit, re-transmit and simulcast the said Tele-

drama or portions thereof.

19. Having purchased the said rights, the 1st Respondent had commenced screening the Tele-

drama. However, the said Tele-drama, despite airing in the prime time, had not attracted

the desired level of commercial endorsement, failing to generate sufficient income.

20. The Respondents submit a comparison of the Television Viewing Ratings (TVR) of the 1st

Respondent channel and other channels for the time belt in which the Tele-drama in

SC (F/R) 282/2015 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 11

question was aired and state that this rating has a direct impact on the revenue generated

during that period. It is in these circumstances that the 1st Respondent had terminated

the screening of the Tele-drama pursuant to a decision dated 8th May 2015.9

21. The said Respondent further states that the decision to terminate the Agreement with the

Petitioners was a decision taken by the Programme Procurement Committee consisting

of ten officers on the grounds that it was not generating the expected revenue.

22. Furthermore, the Respondents state that not only the said Tele-drama but three other

Tele-dramas have been terminated for not producing a sufficient income. The

Respondents submit that the decision to terminate the said Tele-drama is purely a

business decision in order to maximise their performance as a business entity.

23. It was also submitted by the Respondents that they have acted in terms of Clause 1 of the

Agreement entered into with the Petitioners in terminating the said Agreement.

24. The Respondents further state that the Respondents are not bound to pay extra

charge/compensation for the episodes re-televised, adhering to the order by the Human

Rights Commission, since they have already purchased the said episode and hold the right

to re-televise the episodes under and in terms of the Agreement between the Petitioners

and the Respondents.

ANALYSIS

25. After perusing the materials presented to this Court, it can be observed that the

Respondents have tendered notices to the Petitioners in terms of Clause 1 of the

Commercial Agreement entered into by the parties to terminate the Agreement.

9 Marked R1 attached to the Aidavit dated 23rd November 2016

SC (F/R) 282/2015 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 11

26. As it was observed, according to the Television Viewing Ratings (TVR)10 tendered to this

Court, the said Tele-drama had not reached the expected number of viewers.

Furthermore, according to the internal reports11 tendered by the Respondents, it is clear

that the said Tele-drama failed to generate the income which was projected by the

Respondent Corporation.

27. It is also pertinent to highlight, as was contended by the learned Deputy Solicitor General,

that the 1st Respondent has the highest coverage across the island among the other TV

Channels. However, despite that, the TVR Ratings tendered by the Respondents to this

Court transpired a staggeringly low viewing rating during the time when the said Tele-

drama was aired.

28. Furthermore, it is the view of this Court that the Agreements entered into between the

parties are purely of a commercial nature. Hence, party autonomy concerning the matters

set out in such Agreements ought to be respected by this Court. If the Petitioners wish to

challenge the manner in which the Respondents have conducted themselves within the

contours of such Agreements, this may not be the appropriate forum, considering the

nature of the jurisdiction exercised by this Court and its inherent limitations. The Court

has previously commented on such limitations when commercial and highly technical

matters are canvassed by way of a fundamental rights application.

29. As Samayawardhena J observed previously in Sierra Construction Ltd. v. Road

Development Authority and others12,

Neither the Court nor the petitioner possesses the requisite expertise, resources

and capacity to challenge through a fundamental rights application the accuracy of

10 Marked R10(A) attached to the Aidavit dated 23rd November 2016

11 Marked R10(B) attached to the Aidavit dated 23rd November 2016

12 SC/FR/135/2023, SC minutes dated 10th February 2025

SC (F/R) 282/2015 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 11

the findings in the several reports filed by the Technical Evaluation Committee, the

Ministry Procurement Committee, and the Expert Committee appointed by the Court.

Based on the facts and circumstances of the case, the findings in those reports are

not perverse and are prima facie acceptable to the Court. In such cases, in exercising

its writ or fundamental rights jurisdiction, this Court must exercise caution in

revisiting decisions that are highly technical in nature. This restraint is necessitated

by the Courts institutional limitations.

If the petitioner truly wishes to challenge the findings of those reports, the petitioner

would have to go before a different forum, and this cannot practically be done within

the context of a fundamental rights application decided on limited pleadings without

oral evidence, and meant to be concluded within two months of its filing, as

stipulated by Article 126(5) of the Constitution. Those are statutory limitations. I am

aware that the contours of the applicability of Article 12(1), the right to equality, have

expanded significantly over the years to encompass virtually any violation under its

purview. However, every procedural or substantive error does not and cannot attract

the invocation of the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.13

30. Commercial Agreements, as the term denotes, are in fact for profit-making endeavours,

and the parties have the freedom to make appropriate business decisions which would

benefit their respective businesses. In the circumstance where the Tele-drama in question

was not performing to the expected level and not generating the expected revenue, the

1st Respondent, as a business entity, should be free to take appropriate business decisions

to terminate their agreement.

31. In fact, the core purpose of including a termination clause in an agreement is to give the

freedom for the parties of such agreement to terminate the same as and when required.

13 Ibid, at pp. 10-11

SC (F/R) 282/2015 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 11

32. As it was stated in the Sierra Construction Ltd. v Road Development Authority and

others (supra), I am in complete agreement with my brothers opinion that if each and

every breach of law or a violation of a contractual right or a breach of contract cannot and

should not be treated as a violation of a fundamental right. If that were so, this Courts

role in addressing the genuine violations would indeed be heavily diluted.

33. As was observed in Wijesinghe v. Attorney General and Others,14

We have to take cognizance of the distinction between ordinary rights and

fundamental rights, and it is only a breach of a fundamental right that calls for our

intervention. Every wrong decision or breach of the law does not attract the

constitutional remedies relating to fundamental rights.

34. It is perhaps necessary for me to highlight at this juncture that, while the 1st Respondent

is a corporation amenable to fundamental rights jurisdiction, such amenability does not

make this a one-size-fits-all forum to bring all disputes relating to such corporation.

Enabling such a practice to continue could potentially open up floodgates, causing various

claims associated with State corporations to flow through and clog the systems of this

Court.

35. As such, for the reasons mentioned above, I am of the opinion that the circumstances of

this matter relate merely to a Commercial Agreement and a dispute between parties

arising therefrom.

36. I refrain from making any declarations as to the contractual rights and obligations on the

part of the Petitioners and the Respondents, for such is not the function of this Court in

the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 126 of the Constitution.

37. I find no violations of the Petitioners rights guaranteed under the fundamental rights

chapter of the Constitution as alleged by the Petitioners. Accordingly, the Application

should stand dismissed.

Application Dismissed.
