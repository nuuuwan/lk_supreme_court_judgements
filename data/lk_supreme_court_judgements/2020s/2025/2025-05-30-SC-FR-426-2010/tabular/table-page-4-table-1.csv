"The other two persons had been produced before the Magistrate and they had"
"pleaded guilty, while the petitioner had refused to make a statement. Police"
"records reveal that the petitioner and the garage owner have several pending"
"cases in the Magistrates Court. (2R8a)"
"According to document marked and attached as 2R7, the petitioner had been"
"drunk and behaving in a very unruly manner in the Yatiyanthota town with"
"some others on the night of 29th June and when the police jeep arrived, he had"
"runaway."
"The respondents also had recorded statement of persons who had been in the"
"Yatiyanthota town at the time of the incident, which are at 2R5, which clearly"

"The petitioner had filed only the garage ownerâ€™s affidavit to substantiate his"
"position but the said affidavit does not reveal whether the respondents"
"assaulted the petitioner, as alleged by him, or the place in which the alleged"

"statements from very independent people to say that the petitioner was part of"
"a very unruly, drunk crowd in the town of Yatiyanthota and ran away when the"
"police jeep arrived at the scene."
"Therefore, there is no reasonable evidence to draw the inference that the"
"petitioner sustained injuries from being assaulted by the respondents."
"Instead, there is cogent evidence to say that the petitioner was involved in an"
