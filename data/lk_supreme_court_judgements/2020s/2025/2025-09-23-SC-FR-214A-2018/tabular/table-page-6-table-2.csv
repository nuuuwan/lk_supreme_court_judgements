"1","5)","The  first  is  that  the  marking  scheme  that  was  followed  at  the  interview  [P13]"
"","","provided  only  for  thirty  marks  for  Educational  Qualifications,  with  the  reduction"
"","","arising from the deletion of the five marks allotted for the PhD. The reduction of"
"","","these five marks did not prejudice the Petitioner or any other candidate as none of"
"","","them possessed a PhD. In fact, it accrued to the advantage of the Petitioner as these"
"","","five  marks  were  added  to  the  seniority  category,  for  which  the  Petitioner  was"
"","","entitled to full marks, irrespective of whether she was marked under P7 or P13."

"","","provision similar thereto that recognised the ICASL qualification."
