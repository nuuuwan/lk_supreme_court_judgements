"Reasons for the change from P7 to P13","",""
"2","2)","I  shall  now  consider  what  led  to  the  impugned  change  after  P7  was  issued.  The"
"","","learned Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent submitted that four days after"
"","","the publication of P7, several employees who were qualified to apply including the"
"","","Petitioner had made written representations to the Chairman of the 1st Respondent"
"","","[3R1] stating that P7 is a deviation from the scheme that existed until then, and that"
"","","there are issues with the manner in which marks are to be allotted in terms of P7."
"","","They had requested that due recognition be given to the seniority of the employees"
"","","who are eligible to apply, as they have been stagnating in the same grade for several"
"","","years.  Those  who  have  signed  3R1  have  also  pointed  out  that  there  is  a  lack  of"
"","","uniformity 
in  allotting  marks  between 
the  various  divisions  within 
the  1st"
"","","Respondent,  and  that  persons  such  as  the  Petitioner  who  are  attached  to  the"
"","","Finance Division of the 1st Respondent have lost out from being promoted on many"
"","","occasions as a result of due recognition not being afforded to seniority."
"2","3)","The learned Senior State Counsel submitted further that the said representations in"
"","","3R1 were considered by the 1st Respondent as part of an overall restructuring of the"
"","","criteria  and  marking  scheme 
for  recruitments  and  promotions  within  the  1st"
"","","Respondent. She stated that having obtained the approval of the Board of Directors"
"","","of  the  1st  Respondent  on  20th  February  2018,  the  1st  Respondent  had  issued  the"
"","","document  titled  ‘Criteria  and  marking  scheme  for  recruitments  and  promotions’"
"","","[P13/3R3] which was to apply across all levels of recruitment and promotions within"
"","","the 1st Respondent. It was therefore the position of the learned Senior State Counsel"
"","","that P13 was not limited to the selection of candidates to fill the vacancies referred"
"","","to in P7."
"2","4)","Thus, the first argument of the learned Senior State Counsel was that the change in"
"","","the marking scheme in P7 was carried out as part of an overall restructuring of the"
"","","scheme of recruitment and promotion within the 1st Respondent, a process which"
"","","had been undertaken by the 1st Respondent even prior to the issuance of P7, and"
"","","that 
in  doing  so, 
the  grievances  of 
the  Petitioner  and  several  others  were"
"","","considered."
