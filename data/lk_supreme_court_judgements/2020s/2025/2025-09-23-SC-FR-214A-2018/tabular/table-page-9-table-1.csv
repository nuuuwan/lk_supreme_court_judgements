"25)","The  learned  Senior  State  Counsel  emphasised  that  the  new  scheme  of  allotting"
"","marks did not seek to discriminate the Petitioner in any manner. I must observe that"
"","the  Petitioner  has  not  made  any  specific  allegation  that  P13  was  introduced  to"
"","penalize her or to favour others. Hence, I am in agreement with the submission of"
"","the learned Senior State Counsel that P13 was introduced by the 1st Respondent in"
"","good  faith  and  not  with  a  view to penalizing the  Petitioner  or  to  grant  an  undue"
"","advantage to any other candidate."

6)","The second argument of the learned Senior State Counsel was that the Petitioner"
"","benefitted from the deviation. The request that more marks be allotted for seniority"
"","has  in  fact  been  acceded  to  by  the  1st  Respondent  as  seen  in  the  increase  from"
"","twenty marks under P7 to thirty marks under P13, thus benefitting the Petitioner"
"","and others who had served long periods in the 1st Respondent without receiving a"
"","promotion  to  Grade  A.  Thus,  it  was  contended  that  the  Petitioner  obtained  an"
"","advantage of ten marks which she would not otherwise have been entitled to had"
"","P7 been applied. That the Petitioner benefitted from the  change is evident from the"
"","fact that  the 7th, 9th and 10th Respondents had less marks than the Petitioner for"
"","seniority."

7)","Even though P13 may have been part of an overall restructuring of the recruitment"
"","and promotion scheme within the 1st Respondent, and even though it appears that"
"","the 1st Respondent took into consideration the representations made in 3R1,  the"
"","material tendered to this Court does not demonstrate that those persons who had"
"","applied  pursuant 
to  P7 
including 
the  Petitioner  had  been  apprised  of 
the"
"","applicability of P13, thus denying such persons the opportunity of challenging P13"
"","prior to it being applied at the interview."

8)","As pointed out in N.C. Gajaweera and Others v Professor Siri Hettige, Chairman,"
"","National  Police  Commission  and  Others  [SC  (FR)  Application  No.  14/2017;  SC"
"","minutes  of  20th  March  2024],  “A  fundamental  requirement 
inherent 
in  a  fair"
"","selection  process  is  the  need  to  maintain  transparency  throughout  all  stages  of"
"","recruitment and promotion.” Thus, I am of the view that any change to the scheme"
"","laid down in P7 ought to have been formally announced within the 1st Respondent"
"","and  especially  to  those  who  had  responded  to  P7.  Quite  apart  from  maintaining"
