    "text": "Obeyesekere, J 1) The Petitioner is an employee of the 1st Respondent, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. She has complained to this Court that the failure on the part of the 1st Respondent to appoint her to the post of Officer (Audit) - Grade A7 at the 1st Respondent is unreasonable, irrational and arbitrary, and is therefore violative of her fundamental right to equality and the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. In addition to the declaration that her fundamental rights have been violated, the Petitioner has sought a declaration that the decision to promote the 6th \u2013 10th Respondents to the said post is null and void, and an order directing the 1st Respondent to appoint the Petitioner to the post of Officer (Audit) \u2013 Grade A7. 2) Leave to proceed was granted on 15th October 2018 for the alleged violation of Article 12(1). Facts in brief 3) The Petitioner had joined the 1st Respondent on 2nd October 1995 as an Accounts Clerk \u2013 Grade 3, and had been confirmed in service in November 1999 with effect from her date of appointment. She had thereafter been promoted as an Audit Clerk \u2013 Grade B2 in 2005. The job designation of the Petitioner had been changed to Management Assistant (Accounts and Audit) in 2012. 4) By an internal notice issued on 6th July 2017 [P7], the 1st Respondent had called for applications for the posts of Officer (Audit) - Grades A5, A6 and A7. The Petitioner states that she possessed the required qualifications stipulated in P7 to apply for the post of Officer (Audit) \u2013 Grade A7 and that she accordingly submitted an application on 18th July 2017 [P8]. The Petitioner had been called for an interview on 6th April 2018, together with several others including the 6th \u2013 11th Respondents. The Petitioner states that while she was not selected, she became aware on 29th June 2018 that the 6th \u2013 8th Respondents had been selected for the said post. She had found out a few days later that the 9th and 10th Respondents too had been selected, with the 11th Respondent having been named on the reserved list.",

The Petitioner states that amending the marking scheme after the calling of applications is arbitrary and a violation of her expectation that marks will be allotted in accordance with P7. This is the first submission of the learned President\u2019s Counsel for the Petitioner. 8) The stated intention in formulating a scheme of recruitment containing the criteria that would be followed in selecting the most suitable candidate is to ensure that the selection process remains transparent at all times and to create a level playing field, thus affording those who are eligible for any appointment or promotion an equal opportunity of being selected. 9) It is common ground that once applications are called to fill a vacancy with the criteria for selection being laid down in the notice calling for applications, such criteria including the marking scheme must remain frozen until selections are made.
