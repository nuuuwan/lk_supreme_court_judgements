"","which was the correct course of action to have been followed. It is clear from the"
"","judgment of the High Court that it proceeded on the basis that the evidence of Arain"
"","had been struck off and his evidence has not been considered."
"(","36)  Virjee was called as a witness only because the previous witness was not available."
"","Virjee was not directly involved with the transaction and his name did not feature in"
"","any of the correspondence. He was however the Legal Counsel of the Plaintiff during"
"","the time the transaction took place and was involved during the time the parties"
"","negotiated  a  settlement.  While  he  did  not  have  personal  knowledge  of  the"
"","transaction, his position was that he was affirming to the facts from “the information"
"","gathered  from  books  and  documents 
in  the  custody  of  the  Plaintiff  which  are"
"","available to me.”"
"(","37)  The application of the learned President’s Counsel who appeared for the Defendant"
"","at that time that he is objecting to paragraph 5 onwards of the affidavit of Virjee was"
"","on the basis that it contained inadmissible evidence. These averments were almost"
"","in its entirety a reproduction of the averments of the plaint, on which most of the"
"","admissions were based."
"(","38)  The 
learned  President’s  Counsel  who  appeared  for  the  Plaintiff  at  that  time"
"","responding to the said objection had stated as follows:"
"","“This  is  a  matter  that  has  to  be  gone  into  at  a  later  stage  because  most  of  the"
"","documents are admitted in the admissions. Exchage of correspondence is admitted"
"","and  whether  the  evidence  is  hearsay  or  not 
is  a  matter  to  be  tested  in  cross"
"","examination because the Plaintiff’s case is basically on documents and this objection"
"","is totally premature …”"
"(","39) 
I am in agreement with the above submission of the Plaintiff. I am also of the view"
"","that  since  almost  the  entirety  of  the  Plaintiff’s  case  was  based  on  admissions,"
"","whether any evidence that Virjee may give was to be rejected on the basis that it"
"","was hearsay was a matter to be determined after the cross examination of Virjee. I"
"","am  therefore  in  agreement  with  the  view  taken  by  the  High  Court  that  the  said"
"","objection be considered at a later stage."
