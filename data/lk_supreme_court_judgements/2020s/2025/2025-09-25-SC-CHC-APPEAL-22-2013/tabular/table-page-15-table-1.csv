"","","the  Defendant  did  not  move  that  it  be  tried  as  a  preliminary  issue  nor  did  the"
"","","Defendant address it in the written submissions filed in the High Court."
"(","","45)  The learned President’s Counsel for the Defendant submitted that the transaction"
"","","was  a  contract  for  the  sale  of  a  good,  that  being  the  Vessel,  and  the  applicable"
"","","provision for the purposes of prescription is Section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance,"
"","","which reads as follows:"
"","","“No action shall be maintainable for or in respect of any goods sold and delivered,"
"","","or for any shop bill or book debt, or for work and labour done, or for the wages of"
"","","artisans, laborers, or servants, unless the same shall be brought within one year after"
"","","the debt shall have become due.”"
"(","46)","It is noted that in terms of Section 2(1) of the Sale of Goods Ordinance No. 11 of"
"","","1896, as  amended [the  Ordinance],  a  contract  for  the sale  of goods is  a  contract"
"","","whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in the goods to the"
"","","buyer for a money consideration called the price, with the former called a ‘sale’ and"
"","","the latter an ‘agreement to sell’."
"(","","47)  The learned President’s Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that (a) the ownership of"
"","","the  Vessel  remained  with  the  Defendant  at  all  times,  (b)  the  management  and"
"","","control of the Vessel too remained with the Defendant, and (c) the Vessel was never"
"","","sold and/or delivered to the Plaintiff, although the Vessel was made available to the"
"","","Plaintiff for its use. It was therefore his submission that the transaction was not a"
"","","typical sale of a good, and the requirements of Section 8 have not been satisfied."
"(","48)","In terms of Section 2(1) it is through a ‘contract for the sale of a good' that the seller"
"","","either transfers or agrees to transfer the property. The former is a sale and the latter"
"","","is an agreement to sell. Therefore, as provided in Section 59, a ""contract for sale"""
"","","can  include  either  a  sale  or  an  agreement  to  sell.  An  agreement  to  sell  is  not"
"","","considered as a sale, rather it is considered as a contract for the sale of a good."
"(","","49)  For Section 8 to apply, there are two elements that must be satisfied. The first is,"
"","","there must be a sale of a good. It is admitted that through email correspondence an"
"","","agreement to sell was made between the Plaintiff and the Defendant to purchase"
