"claim that the Plaintiff is not entitled to the refund of the advance payment or that"
"it is entitled as of right to forfeit the entire advance payment or any part thereof."
"(
28)  While neither party presented any material as to what transpired immediately after"
"D2 was sent, the documents that are available do indicate that the parties discussed"
"a settlement and action was filed only when negotiations in that regard failed."
"(
29)  Critical to the success of the claim of the Plaintiff that the parties had agreed that"
"the  Plaintiff  shall  be  entitled  to  a  full  refund  in  the  event  of  the  transaction  not"
"proceeding, is the admission made by the Defendant that the advance payment was"
"being held in trust by the Defendant – vide P1(c). The documents before me do not"
"indicate that there has been a change in that position, nor did the Defendant allege"
"such a change, either in its correspondence, its pleadings or in the cross examination"
"of Virjee."
"(30)  P3,  P4  and  P5  sent  by  the  Defendant  after  the  Vessel  was  returned  and  during"
"negotiations acknowledge the receipt of the advance payment, but do not claim that"
"the Defendant was entitled to forfeit the advance. Instead, P3 – P5 gives credit to"
"the  entire  advance  payment  but  asserts  the  right  of  the  Defendant  to  set  off  its"
"losses against such sum including the loss arising from the resale of the Vessel, the"
"cost of maintenance of the Vessel and the loss suffered as a result of not being able"
"to charter the Vessel during the interim period."
"(31)  Thus, with the Defendant having failed to prove that retaining 10% of the contract"
"price from the advance payment is a standard practice in the shipping industry, I am"
"satisfied on the documents that the Plaintiff has established a prima facie case that"
"it  is  entitled  to  a  full  refund  of  the  advance  payment,  subject  to  the  right  of  the"
"Defendant to recover any losses that it may have suffered arising from the return of"
"the  Vessel.  I  must  state  that  during  the  negotiations  and  as  part  of  an  overall"
"settlement,  the  Plaintiff  was  willing  to  concede  that  the  Defendant  has  suffered"
"losses arising as a result of the transaction not proceeding."
