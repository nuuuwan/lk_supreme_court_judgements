Factual matrix

The 7th and 8th Respondents made a joint application to the National Gem

and Jewellery Authority (the 1st Respondent) seeking a gemming licence

in terms of section 15(3) of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority Act

No. 50 of 1993 in respect of the land known as Bogahawatta in the

district of Ratnapura on the basis that they collectively hold more than

two-thirds share of the land. It is common ground that in accordance

with No. 8(2) of the State Gem Corporation By-Laws No. 1 of 1971

published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 14,989/8 dated 23.12.1971

marked A23, a person applying for a gemming licence shall establish that

he himself owns the land or he has obtained the consent of so many of

other owners as to ensure that he and such other consenting owners

together own at least two-thirds of the land in respect of which the

application has been made. The Petitioner objected to the application on

the ground that the 7th and 8th Respondents do not hold more than a two-

thirds share of the land, but he does.

After inquiry, the 1st Respondent Authority, having determined that

neither the Petitioner nor the 7th and 8th Respondents had established

entitlement to a two-thirds share of the land, dismissed both applications

and communicated its decision to the Petitioner by A25 dated 03.05.2013

and to the 7th and 8th Respondents by A26 of the same date.

According to section 15(8) of the Act, when the 1st Respondent Authority

refuses such an application, the dissatisfied party may appeal to the

Secretary to the line Ministry within thirty days of the refusal. However,

instead of following this procedure, both parties appear to have appealed

against the decision of the 1st Respondent Authority to the same

Authority. Subsequently, the Director General of the 1st Respondent

5

SC/MIS/4/2014

Authority (the 3rd Respondent), sitting on appeal against the said

decision, decided to issue the licence to the 7th and 8th Respondents on

the basis that they had established a two-thirds share of the land and

communicated this decision to the Petitioner and the 7th and 8th

Respondents by A27 dated 06.01.2014.

Aggrieved by this order, the Petitioner appealed to the Secretary to the

Ministry of Environment (the 5th Respondent), who by order marked A29

dated 12.09.2014 affirmed the decision of the Director General of the 1st

Respondent Authority. The Petitioner filed this appeal before this Court

against the decision of the 5th Respondent in terms of section 15(11) of

the Act.

At the argument before this Court learned counsel for the Petitioner-

Appellant challenged the decisions of the 3rd and 5th Respondents both

on the merits and procedural impropriety. In relation to the latter,

learned counsel submitted that if an application made to the 1st

Respondent Authority is refused, in terms of section 15(8) of the Act, a

right of appeal is available to such party to the Secretary to the line

Ministry, and in this instance, the appeal made to the Director General

of the 1st Respondent Authority against the decision of 1st Respondent

Authority is bad in law. The counsel argued that the decision of the

Director General in allowing the appeal of the 7th and 8th Respondents is

ultra vires and made without authority. The subsequent order of the 5th

Respondent affirming the decision of the Director General has no force or

avail in law.

I have no hesitation in accepting the argument of the learned counsel for

the Petitioner-Appellant. The Director General of the 1st Respondent

Authority cannot sit on appeal against a decision of his own Authority

and reverse it.

6

SC/MIS/4/2014

Learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 1st Respondent has

tendered to Court the inquiry proceedings which led the 3rd Respondent

to reverse the decision of the 1st Respondent Authority with the motion

dated 29.08.2024. According to the documents filed with that motion it

appears to me that the 3rd Respondent has not held an inquiry but has

reversed the decision of the 1st Respondent Authority on the

recommendations of the Legal Officer of the 1st Respondent Authority

dated 03.01.2014. The first paragraph of the said document dated

03.01.2014 reveals that the 7th and 8th Respondents had appealed

against the decision of the Authority to the Legal Branch relying on the

same material presented at the original application. ( -

1. 2. ,

.

.)

There are no inquiry notes indicating the presence of any fresh material.

According to the last document attached to that motion, written by the

Legal Officer to the 7th and 8th Respondents, the 7th and 8th Respondents

have sent a petition, not an appeal. (

-

.) A copy of the said petition

has not been tendered to Court for the Court to understand the precise

nature of the appeal tendered by the 7th and 8th Respondents which

culminated in the 3rd Respondent reversing the decision of the Authority.

It is abundantly clear that reversing the decision of the 1st Respondent

Authority by the 3rd Respondent in favour of the 7th and 8th Respondents

has been done completely outside the purview of appellate procedure laid

7

SC/MIS/4/2014

down by the Act. The decision of the Director General is ultra vires and,

therefore, a nullity. Consequently, there is no valid decision in the eyes

of the law for the 5th Respondent to affirm.

A decision made ultra vires is a nullity

If a decision is ultra vires, it is a nullity for all intents and purposes. It is

void, not voidable. Everything that stems from a decision which is a

nullity also automatically becomes a nullity without further ado.

Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [1961] 3 All ER 1169 at

1172 articulates this notion in his own inimitable style in this way:

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad, but

incurably bad. There is no need for an order of the court to set it

aside. It is automatically null and void without more ado, though it

is sometimes convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And

every proceeding which is founded on it is also bad and incurably

bad. You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there.

It will collapse.

This passage was referred to with approval by Justice G.P.S. de Silva (as

he then was) in Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera [1982] 1 Sri Kantha LR

164 at 168-169, Justice Sharvananda (as he then was) in Sirisena v.

Kobbekaduwa, Minister of Agriculture and Lands (1978) 80 NLR 1 at 182,

and Justice Sripavan (as he then was) in Leelawathie v. Commissioner of

National Housing [2004] 3 Sri LR 175 at 178 and in many more

judgments.

Professor Paul Craig in Administrative Law, (3rd Edition, Sweet & Maxwell

1994) at page 456 takes the view that the invalid acts are retrospectively

void:

8

SC/MIS/4/2014

As we have seen, this means that the decision-maker never had the

power to make the decision, and that, therefore, the decision could

have no effect at all. This is encapsulated by the idea that decisions

made outside jurisdiction are retrospectively null or invalid.

Professor William Wade and Professor Christopher Forsyth in

Administrative Law (11th Edition, 2014) echo the same sentiments when

they state at page 249 that since a void administrative act is, and always

has been, non-existent in law, a finding that an act is void will generally

be retrospective.

Although this general principle vitiates everything which flows from the

original ultra vires decision, it is customary for Courts to issue formal

orders quashing such subsequent decisions, albeit redundantly.

Professor De Smith in De Smiths Judicial Review (8th Edition, 2018) at

page 1011 under the discussion on the Courts discretion in granting and

withdrawing remedies opines:

There can be no purpose in purporting to keep alive a decision which

is devoid of all content. Subject to there being some purpose in

obtaining the decision of a court, if the court comes to the conclusion

that a decision is totally invalid and of no effect, it will normally

readily be prepared to grant a declaration to this effect. Strictly

speaking there is nothing to be achieved in the case of a decision

which is a nullity in making a quashing order. You cannot quash

something which is already a nullity. However, in practice adopting

a pragmatic approach and so avoiding becoming involved in issues

as to the quality and status of an invalid administrative decision, the

court will be prepared to make a quashing order without resolving

the complex issue as to whether or not this is strictly necessary. This

is subject to the case being one in which the court would in any event

9

SC/MIS/4/2014

have granted relief, if this were necessary, in the form of a quashing

order.

Presumption of validity and ultra vires decisions

The presumption of validity deviates from the general principle that there

is no need for an order of the Court to set aside a decision which is a

nullity because such a decision together with follow up decisions is

automatically null and void without any intervention of Court.

Even if a decision is ex facie ultra vires, the question of whether it is

automatically null and void or requires a formal pronouncement by the

Court has now become a matter of contention. This is especially so in

view of the presumption of validity, which recognizes that all official

decisions are presumed to be valid until set aside or otherwise held to be

invalid by a Court of competent jurisdiction. This is to protect the

entitlement of the public to rely upon the official decisions and to prevent

individuals from taking the law into their own hands.

Clive Lewis in Judicial Remedies in Public Law (2nd Edition, London Sweet

& Maxwell, 2000) at page 150 states The concept of ultra vires and

voidness are deceptively simple in appearance but have given rise to

theoretical and practical problems. Wade at page 248 states an absolute

approach to invalidity, although principled and resting upon high authority,

poses conundrums that need to be understood in order to be resolved. De

Smith at page 230 says Behind the simple dichotomy of void acts (void ab

initio, invalid, without legal effect) and voidable acts (valid until held by a

court to be invalid) lurk terminological and conceptual problems of

excruciating complexity. Wade at page 249 stating that we see the

conundrum that theoretically void administrative acts are functionally

voidable gives an example at page 250 that A common case where an

order, however void, becomes valid for practical purposes is where a

10

SC/MIS/4/2014

statutory time limit expires after which its validity cannot be questioned.

The statute does not say that the void order shall be valid; but by cutting

off legal remedies it produces that result.

There are decisions of the House of Lords which vigorously support the

view that for an apparent validity to be a nullity there must be judicial

intervention and it cannot happen as a matter of course. Lord Radcliffe

in Smith v. East Elloe RDC [1956] AC 736 at 769 states:

An order, even if not made in good faith, is still an act capable of

legal consequences. It bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead.

Unless the necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the

cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset, it will

remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable

of orders.

This point of view was adopted by the House of Lords in Hoffman-La

Roche and Co. v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295

at 365 where Lord Diplock stated:

Under our legal system, however, the courts as the judicial arm of

government do not act on their own initiative. Their jurisdiction to

determine that a statutory instrument is ultra vires does not arise

until its validity is challenged in proceedings inter partes either

brought by one party to enforce the law declared by the instrument

against another party or brought by a party whose interests are

affected by the law so declared sufficiently directly to give him locus

standi to initiate proceedings to challenge the validity of the

instrument. Unless there is such challenge and, if there is, until it

has been upheld by a judgment of the court, the validity of the

statutory instrument and the legality of acts done pursuant to the

law declared by it are presumed.

11

SC/MIS/4/2014

Lord Diplock at page 366 imposed further restrictions when he stated

that the presumption of validity can be rebutted only before a court of

competent jurisdiction by a party having locus standi to do so.

I think it leads to confusion to use such terms as voidable,

voidable ab initio, void or a nullity as descriptive of the legal

status of subordinate legislation alleged to be ultra vires for patent

or for latent defects, before its validity has been pronounced on by a

court of competent jurisdiction. These are concepts developed in the

private law of contract which are ill-adapted to the field of public

law. All that can usefully be said is that the presumption that

subordinate legislation is intra vires prevails in the absence of

rebuttal, and that it cannot be rebutted except by a party to legal

proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction who has locus standi

to challenge the validity of the subordinate legislation in question.

All locus standi on the part of anyone to rebut the presumption of

validity may be taken away completely or may be limited in point of

time or otherwise by the express terms of the Act of Parliament which

conferred the subordinate legislative power, though the courts lean

heavily against a construction of the Act which would have this effect

(cf. Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission [1969] 2

A.C. 147). Such was the case, however, in the view of the majority

of this House in Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council [1956] A.C.

736, at any rate as respects invalidity on the ground of latent

defects, so the compulsory purchase order sought to be challenged

in the action had legal effect notwithstanding its potential invalidity.

Furthermore, apart from express provision in the governing statute,

locus standi to challenge the validity of subordinate legislation may

be restricted, under the courts inherent power to control its own

procedure, to a particular category of persons affected by the

subordinate legislation, and if none of these persons chooses to

12

SC/MIS/4/2014

challenge it the presumption of validity prevails. Such was the case

in Durayappah v. Fernando [1967] 2 A.C. 337 where on an appeal

from Ceylon, although the Privy Council was of opinion that an order

of the Minister was ultra vires owing to a latent defect in the

procedure prior to its being made, they nevertheless treated it as

having legal effect because the party who sought to challenge it had,

in their view, no locus standi to do so.

De Smith at page 231 on the dichotomy of acts from void and voidable

to lawful and unlawful suggests that a formal pronouncement of a

Court is helpful for the aggrieved partys own safety:

Again, although an ultra vires decision was ineffective against the

party aggrieved, he might need, for his own protection, a formal

pronouncement of a court setting the decision or declaring it be void.

Meanwhile, he could be enjoined from disregarding the decision until

its validity had been finally determined. If he took no judicial

proceedings at all within a prescribed statutory time limit, the void

decision could become impregnable as if it has been valid in the first

place.

However, Wade at page 249 referring to the presumption of validity

comments thus:

The House of Lords held in 1975 that there is a presumption of

validity in favour of a disputed order until set aside by the court. And

this is so even where temporary obedience to the disputed order

would cause irreparable loss to a party. But their Lordships have

since been held that this presumption was an evidential matter at

the interlocutory stage and involved no sweeping proposition that

subordinate legislation must be treated for all purposes as valid until

set aside. (R v. Wicks [1998] AC 92 at 116 by Lord Hoffmann) There

13

SC/MIS/4/2014

is no rule that lends validity to invalid acts. (Boddington v. British

Transport Police [1999] 2 AC 143 at 174) The presumption of validity,

therefore, is temporary and procedural only; it does not determine

the validity in law of the disputed act.

The effect of the presumption is that the impugned decision is presumed

to be good in law until it is pronounced to be unlawful, but after which it

regarded as never having had any legal effect at all.

Lord Denning in Lovelock v. Minister of Transport (1980) 40 P. & C.R. 336

at 345 was disconcerted about this conundrum revolving around void

and voidability:

Assuming that he did fail to take into account a relevant

consideration, the result is that, in point of legal theory, his consent

was void. It was made without jurisdiction. It was a nullity. Just

as if he had failed to observe the rules of natural justice. But, in point

of practice, it was voidable. It seems to me to be a matter of words

semantics and that is all. I have got tired of all the discussion

about void and voidable. The plain fact is that, even if such a

decision as this is void or a nullity, it remains in being unless and

until some steps are taken before the courts to have it declared void.

By virtue of the presumption of validity, a formal pronouncement of

nullity is necessary with regard to the initial ultra vires decision. While it

is desirable to have a formal judicial pronouncement regarding

subsequent actions or decisions, such a pronouncement is not

mandatory. Nonetheless, prudence dictates that a formal pronouncement

be made, depending on the unique facts and circumstances of each case.

For example, if X has been invalidly removed from an office and Y has

been appointed in his place, or if the licence issued to X has been invalidly

cancelled and allocated to Y, X cannot disregard the invalid decisions and

14

SC/MIS/4/2014

carry on as if nothing has happened. Conversely, if those invalid

decisions made in respect of X are declared null and void by formal

pronouncements by Court, in practice, the decisions made in favour of Y

cannot have any effect notwithstanding that no such formal

pronouncement by Court has been made. This is because, once the initial

decision is declared a nullity, there is no room to accommodate Y. In such

an event, Ys remedy lies against the wrongful decision maker, and not

against X.

In the backdrop of the presumption of validity, what is the status of

the subsequent acts taken on the basis of the first void act?

Clive Lewis in Judicial Remedies in Public Law at page 154 states The

need to establish illegality says nothing about the remedy that follows once

the invalidity has been established. Nor does it necessarily say anything

about the legal status of the act in the period between the decision and the

court ruling that the act is unlawful.

In this regard, Wade at page 252 says:

The theory of the second actor holds that the validity of these second

acts does not depend upon any presumption of validity or judicial

exercise of a discretion to refuse a remedy to an applicant in

particular proceedings. It depends upon the legal powers of the

second actor. Did that second actor have power to act even though

the first act was invalid?

In Boddington v. British Transport Police [1998] 2 WLR 639, Lord Steyn

cited with approval the theory of the second actor as advanced by

Professor Christopher Forsyth in The Metaphysic of Nullity, Invalidity,

Conceptual Reasoning and the Rule of Law, in Christopher Forsyth and

Ivan Hare (eds), The Golden Metwand and the Crooked Cord: Essays on

Public Law in Honour of Sir William Wade (OUP 1998), as follows:

15

SC/MIS/4/2014

I accept the reality that an unlawful byelaw is a fact and that it may

in certain circumstances have legal consequences. The best

explanation that I have seen is by Dr. Forsyth who summarised the

position as follows in The Metaphysic of Nullity, Invalidity,

Conceptual Reasoning and the Rule of Law, at p. 159:

it has been argued that unlawful administrative acts are void in

law. But they clearly exist in fact and they often appear to be valid;

and those unaware of their invalidity may take decisions and act on

the assumption that these acts are valid. When this happens the

validity of these later acts depends upon the legal powers of the

second actor. The crucial issue to be determined is whether that

second actor has legal power to act validly notwithstanding the

invalidity of the first act. And it is determined by an analysis of the

law against the background of the familiar proposition that an

unlawful act is void.

If this theory is applied to the facts and circumstances of this case, it

becomes evident that the Director General did not possess the

jurisdiction to set aside the decision of the 1st Respondent Authority made

under section 15(1) of the Act. Consequently, his decision is invalid in

law. As a result, the parties are left with the decision of the 1st Respondent

Authority, which refused the applications of both parties on the ground

that neither had established a two-thirds share of the land. The 5th

Respondent does not have the authority to ex mero motu review the

decisions of the 1st Respondent Authority without a valid appeal filed by

a dissatisfied party against such a decision. In this case, neither party

appealed against the decision of the 1st Respondent Authority to the 5th

Respondent. The petitioners appeal to the 5th Respondent was against

the decision of the Director General. The 5th Respondent affirmed the

decision of the Director General, not that of the 1st Respondent Authority.

16

SC/MIS/4/2014

It is trite law that a party cannot confer jurisdiction where none exists.

Accordingly, this emerging exception has no application to the present

case.

Collateral attack against invalid decisions

The validity of a decision can be attacked directly or indirectly. However,

this should be allowed with caution. As a general rule, the decision maker

must be heard before the decision is struck down on exceeding powers

or any other ground. An order made contrary to the principles of natural

justice is outside the jurisdiction and void. This is applicable not only to

administrative bodies but also to Courts. Illegality cannot be rectified by

another illegality. Therefore, collateral attacks on decisions should not be

encouraged.

Wade is not against collateral attacks on void decisions when he says at

page 235:

The validity of the act or order may be challenged directly, as in

proceedings for certiorari to quash it or for a declaration that it is

unlawful. But it may also be challenged collaterally, as for example

by way of defence to a criminal charge, or by way of defence to a

demand for some payment. As a general rule, the court will allow

the issue of invalidity to be raised in any proceedings where it is

relevant. Where some act or order is invalid or void, that should be

able to be raised in any proceedings which depend on the validity of

that act.

Clive Lewis at page 154 states:

A challenge to the validity of an act may be by direct action or by

way of collateral or indirect challenge. A direct action is one where

the principal purpose of the action is to establish the invalidity. This

17

SC/MIS/4/2014

will usually be by way of an application or judicial review or by use

of any statutory mechanism for appeal or review. Collateral

challenges arise when the invalidity is raised in the course of some

other proceedings, the purpose of which is not to establish but where

questions of validity become relevant. The invalidity of subordinate

legislation may be raised as a defence in criminal proceedings where

an individual is charged with an offence created by that subordinate

legislation. A public authority may seek the assistance of the court

to enforce a demand for payment, or to recover possession of land,

and the invalidity of the acts of the public body may be raised as a

defence. Or, an individual may bring a tortious action against a

public authority which may claim it is acting lawfully in the exercise

of statutory powers. The individual may in turn allege that the public

authority is acting unlawfully as its actions are ultra vires.

An appeal against convictions for bribery before a statutory tribunal may

succeed on the ground that the members of the tribunal were invalidly

appointed, so that the tribunal was without jurisdiction. The judgment of

the Supreme Court in Ranasinghe v. Bribery Commissioner (1962) 64 NLR

449 where it was held that the conviction of the appellant in this case and

the orders made against him are null and inoperative, on the ground that

the persons composing the Bribery Tribunal which tried him were not

lawfully appointed to the Tribunal was affirmed on appeal by the Privy

Council in Bribery Commissioner v. Ranasinghe (1964) 66 NLR 73.

However, Wade accepts at page 237 that There are a number of situations

in which the court will not permit an order to be challenged in collateral

proceedings. The most obvious is where such proceedings are expressly

excluded by statute. Other cases flow partly from the familiar distinctions

based on jurisdiction, but partly also they are exceptions to the general rule

stated above, made for reasons of convenience.

18

SC/MIS/4/2014

Clive Lewis at page 155 states:

Even if invalidity could potentially be established there are

circumstances where the court will not intervene to quash the act.

Rules governing standing, and the time-limits for bringing

applications for judicial review, may prevent a particular individual

from establishing the invalidity of an act. In addition, in judicial

review proceedings the courts have a wide discretion to refuse a

remedy. The courts have recognised that the consequences of

retrospective nullity, with its requirement that the invalid act be

treated as if it never existed, are on occasions too draconian.

Administrative decisions may, for example, have been relied upon

by third parties.

Futility

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondents submitted that,

consequent to the appeal decision (which this Court now holds ultra

vires), the 7th and 8th respondents were issued the gemming licence,

which has since lapsed. It was therefore argued that, as this appeal has

now become academic, it should be dismissed on the ground of futility. I

am not inclined to agree with this submission.

It is trite law that the rights of the parties shall be determined as at the

time of the institution of the action, not at the time of pronouncing the

judgment. When the Petitioner filed this appeal in this Court within the

appealable period, it appears that either the gem mining licence had not

been issued to the 7th and 8th Respondents or they had not commenced

gem mining.

In any event, this Court does not act in vain by formally quashing A27

and A29 to underscore the proper course of action expected of the

Respondents in the future. Public authorities entrusted with similar

19

SC/MIS/4/2014

functions are hereby reminded that actions inconsistent with their legal

obligations may attract similar judicial consequences. This judgment

serves not only to resolve the present matter but also to reaffirm the

importance of adhering to the principles of legality and accountability in

the discharge of public functions.

In Sundarkaran v. Bharathi [1989] 1 Sri LR 46, the Petitioner-Appellant

sought certiorari and mandamus to challenge the refusal of a liquor

license for the year 1987. By the time the matter was taken up before the

Supreme Court in 1988, the issue had become academic since the year

1987 had already elapsed. Nevertheless, in allowing the appeal, Justice

Amarasinghe observed: The court will not be acting in vain in quashing

the determination not to issue the licence for 1987 because the right of the

Petitioner to be fully and fairly heard in future applications is being

recognised.

In Nimalasiri v. Divisional Secretary, Galewela [2003] 3 Sri LR 85, Justice

Sripavan (as he then was) stated:

Learned State Counsel urged that it is a futile exercise to issue a writ

of certiorari because the decision complained of related to the year

2002 which had already expired. However, following the decision in

Sudakaran v. Barathi and others [1989] 1 Sri LR 46 this Court issues

a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the second Respondent

contained in the letter dated 27.08.2002 marked (P4). Thus this

Court is not acting in vain because the right of the Petitioner to be

fully and fairly heard in future application is recognized.

In the present case despite the lapse of the licence granted to the 7th and

8th respondents, it is important to note that the effect of the courts

judgement of nullity operates erga omnes, and hence a pronouncement

on its invalidity is called for.

As Lord Diplock states in Hoffman-La Roche and Co. v. Secretary of State

for Trade and Industry (supra) at 365:

Although such a decision is directly binding only as between the

parties to the proceedings in which it was made, the application of

the doctrine of precedent has the consequence of enabling the benefit

of it to accrue to all other persons whose legal rights have been

interfered with in reliance on the law which the statutory instrument

purported to declare.

Conclusion

I formally quash the decision of the 3rd Respondent marked A27 and the

decision of the 5th Respondent marked A29 and allow the appeal of the

Petitioner with costs payable by the 7th and 8th Respondents to the

Petitioner.
