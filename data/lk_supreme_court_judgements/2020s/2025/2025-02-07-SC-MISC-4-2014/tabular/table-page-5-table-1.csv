"5       
SC/MIS/4/2014"
"Authority 
(the  3rd  Respondent),  sitting  on  appeal  against 
the  said"
"decision, decided to issue the licence to the 7th and 8th Respondents on"
"the basis that they had established a  two-thirds share of the land and"
"communicated 
this  decision 
to 
the  Petitioner  and 
the  7th  and  8th"
"Respondents by A27 dated 06.01.2014."
"Aggrieved by this order, the Petitioner appealed to the Secretary to the"
"Ministry of Environment (the 5th Respondent), who by order marked A29"
"dated 12.09.2014 affirmed the decision of the Director General of the 1st"
"Respondent Authority. The Petitioner filed this appeal before this Court"
"against the decision of the 5th Respondent in terms of section 15(11) of"
"the Act."
"At  the  argument  before  this  Court  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner-"
"Appellant challenged the decisions of the 3rd and 5th Respondents both"
"on  the  merits  and  procedural  impropriety.  In  relation  to  the  latter,"
"learned  counsel  submitted 
that 
if  an  application  made 
to 
the  1st"
"Respondent Authority is refused, in terms of section 15(8) of the Act, a"
"right  of  appeal  is  available  to  such  party  to  the  Secretary  to  the  line"
"Ministry, and in this instance, the appeal made to the Director General"
"of  the  1st  Respondent  Authority  against  the  decision  of  1st  Respondent"
"Authority  is  bad  in  law.  The  counsel  argued  that  the  decision  of  the"
"Director General in allowing the appeal of the 7th and 8th Respondents is"
"ultra vires and made without authority. The subsequent order of the 5th"
"Respondent affirming the decision of the Director General has no force or"
"avail in law."
"I have no hesitation in accepting the argument of the learned counsel for"
"the  Petitioner-Appellant.  The  Director  General  of  the  1st  Respondent"
"Authority cannot sit on appeal against  a decision of his own Authority"
"and reverse it."
