"that the presumption of validity can be rebutted only before a court of"
"competent jurisdiction by a party having locus standi to do so."
"I  think 
it 
leads  to  confusion  to  use  such  terms  as  “voidable,”"
"“voidable ab initio,” “void” or “a nullity” as descriptive of the legal"
"status of subordinate legislation alleged to be ultra vires for patent"
"or for latent defects, before its validity has been pronounced on by a"
"court of competent jurisdiction. These are concepts developed in the"
"private  law  of  contract  which  are  ill-adapted  to  the  field  of  public"
"law.  All  that  can  usefully  be  said  is  that  the  presumption  that"
"subordinate  legislation  is  intra  vires  prevails  in  the  absence  of"
"rebuttal,  and  that  it  cannot  be  rebutted  except  by  a  party  to  legal"
"proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction who has locus standi"
"to  challenge  the  validity  of  the  subordinate  legislation  in  question."
"All  locus  standi  on  the  part  of  anyone  to  rebut  the  presumption  of"
"validity may be taken away completely or may be limited in point of"
"time or otherwise by the express terms of the Act of Parliament which"
"conferred the subordinate legislative power, though the courts lean"
"heavily against a construction of the Act which would have this effect"
"(cf.  Anisminic  Ltd.  v.  Foreign  Compensation  Commission  [1969]  2"
"A.C. 147). Such was the case, however, in the view of the majority"
"of this House in Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council [1956] A.C."
"736,  at  any  rate  as  respects  invalidity  on  the  ground  of  latent"
"defects, so the compulsory purchase order sought to be challenged"
"in the action had legal effect notwithstanding its potential invalidity."
"Furthermore, apart from express provision in the governing statute,"
"locus standi to challenge the validity of subordinate legislation may"
"be  restricted,  under  the  court’s  inherent  power  to  control  its  own"
"procedure, 
to  a  particular  category  of  persons  affected  by 
the"
"subordinate  legislation,  and  if  none  of  these  persons  chooses  to"
