"intervention and it cannot happen as a matter of course. Lord Radcliffe"
"in Smith v. East Elloe RDC [1956] AC 736 at 769 states:"
"An  order,  even  if  not  made  in  good  faith,  is  still  an  act  capable  of"
"legal consequences. It bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead."
"Unless the necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the"
"cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset, it will"
"remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable"
"of orders."
