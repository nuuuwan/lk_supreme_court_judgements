"Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [1961] 3 All ER 1169 at"
"1172 articulates this notion in his own inimitable style in this way:"
"If  an  act  is  void,  then  it  is  in  law  a  nullity.  It  is  not  only  bad,  but"
"incurably  bad.  There  is  no  need  for  an  order  of  the  court  to  set  it"
"aside. It is automatically null and void without more ado, though it"
"is sometimes convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And"
"every proceeding which is founded on it is also bad and incurably"
"bad. You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there."
"It will collapse."
