"I accept the reality that an unlawful byelaw is a fact and that it may"
"in 
certain 
circumstances  have 
legal 
consequences.  The  best"
"explanation that I have seen is by Dr. Forsyth who summarised the"
"position  as 
follows 
in 
“The  Metaphysic  of  Nullity, 
Invalidity,"
"Conceptual Reasoning and the Rule of Law”, at p. 159:"
"“it  has  been  argued  that  unlawful  administrative  acts  are  void  in"
"law. But they clearly exist in fact and they often appear to be valid;"
"and those unaware of their invalidity may take decisions and act on"
"the  assumption  that  these  acts  are  valid.  When  this  happens  the"
"validity  of  these  later  acts  depends  upon  the  legal  powers  of  the"
"second  actor.  The  crucial  issue  to  be  determined  is  whether  that"
"second  actor  has  legal  power  to  act  validly  notwithstanding  the"
"invalidity of the first act. And it is determined by an analysis of the"
"law  against  the  background  of  the  familiar  proposition  that  an"
"unlawful act is void.”"
