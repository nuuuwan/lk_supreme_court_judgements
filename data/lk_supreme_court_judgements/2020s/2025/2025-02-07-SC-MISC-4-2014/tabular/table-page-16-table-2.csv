"Wade is not against collateral attacks on void decisions when he says at"
"page 235:"
"The  validity  of  the  act  or  order  may  be  challenged  directly,  as  in"
"proceedings  for  certiorari  to  quash  it  or  for  a  declaration  that  it  is"
"unlawful. But it may also be challenged collaterally, as for example"
"by way of defence to a criminal charge, or by way of defence to a"
"demand for some payment. As a general rule, the court will  allow"
"the  issue  of  invalidity  to  be  raised  in  any  proceedings  where  it  is"
"relevant. Where some act or order is invalid or void, that should be"
"able to be raised in any proceedings which depend on the validity of"
"that act."
