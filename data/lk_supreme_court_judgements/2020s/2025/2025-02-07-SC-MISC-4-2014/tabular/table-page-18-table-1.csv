"Clive Lewis at page 155 states:"
"Even 
if 
invalidity 
could  potentially  be  established 
there  are"
"circumstances where the court will not intervene to quash the act."
"Rules 
governing 
standing, 
and 
the 
time-limits 
for 
bringing"
"applications for judicial review, may prevent a particular individual"
"from  establishing  the  invalidity  of  an  act.  In  addition,  in  judicial"
"review  proceedings  the  courts  have  a  wide  discretion  to  refuse  a"
"remedy.  The  courts  have  recognised 
that 
the  consequences  of"
"retrospective  nullity,  with  its  requirement  that  the  invalid  act  be"
"treated  as 
if 
it  never  existed,  are  on  occasions  too  draconian."
"Administrative  decisions  may,  for  example,  have  been  relied  upon"
"by third parties."
