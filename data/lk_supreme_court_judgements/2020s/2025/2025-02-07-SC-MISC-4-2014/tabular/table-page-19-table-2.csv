"Learned State Counsel urged that it is a futile exercise to issue a writ"
"of certiorari because the decision complained of related to the year"
"2002 which had already expired. However, following the decision in"
"Sudakaran v. Barathi and others [1989] 1 Sri LR 46 this Court issues"
"a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the second Respondent"
"contained  in  the  letter  dated  27.08.2002  marked  (P4).  Thus  this"
