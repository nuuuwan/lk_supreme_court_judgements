Court went on to hold that a party who wishes to set aside an arbitral award made in Sri Lanka must file an application under Section 32(1) within sixty days of that party receiving the award. The Court acting ex mero motu may set aside an award on the ground that it is in conflict with the public policy of Sri Lanka under Section 32(1)(b)(ii), but based strictly upon the material placed before the court and only in the course of an application made under Section 32(1).",
