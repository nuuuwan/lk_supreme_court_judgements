"As was emphasized in Mohamed v. Annamalai Chettiar [1932 CLR Vol. XII 228], no Court"
"may disregard the law of the land or purport in any given case, to ignore its provisions."
"Where a matter has been specifically dealt with or provided for by law there can be no"
"question that the law must prevail, for justice must be done according to law."
"In Wakachiku Construction Co. Ltd. Vs. Road Development Authority [(2013) 1 Sri LR 164"
"at 175] Court held that the Act gives a party an express provision to invoke the jurisdiction"
"of the High Court in a particular manner once an award is made and the party seeking to"
"enforce the right must resort to that remedy and not to others."
"The Act contemplates of only one instance where the High Court is empowered to exercise"
"the two jurisdictions at the same time. That is when as required by Section 35(1), the High"
"Court must consolidate applications made to enforce an award and an application to set"
"aside the same award. In Trico Maritime (Pvt) Limited v. Ceylinco Insurance Co. Limited"
"[(2010) 1 Sri LR 163 at 167-168] it was held that the law contemplates the consolidation"
"of applications made to set aside the award and to enforce the award and that it is the"

"High Court in an application made under Section 32(1) of the Act is limited to considering"
"whether an arbitral award should be set aside. There is a patent lack of jurisdiction which"
"prevents  a  High  Court  from  considering  whether  the  award  should  be  enforced  in  an"
"application made pursuant to Section 32(1) to set aside that award."
"The Respondent contended that since the application made by the Appellant to set aside"
"the Award has been rejected by the High Court, the Appellant cannot now object to the"
"enforcement of the Award. Reliance was placed on Section 35(2) of the Act which states"
"the Court shall not permit a party to an arbitration to object to the enforcement of the"
"award on any of the grounds specified in section 34 where an application to set aside the"
"award under section 32 has been refused."
"This  is  misconceived  in  law.  Firstly,  the  Respondent  has  failed  to  properly  invoke  the"
"jurisdiction of the High Court to enforce the Award. As such the question of objecting to"
"the enforcement does not arise. Secondly, Section 34 applies only to the recognition or"
