"On the contrary, where the jurisdiction of the High Court is invoked pursuant to Section"
"32(1)  of  the  Act  by  way  of  petition  and  affidavit,  Court  must  appoint  a  day  for  the"
"determination  of  whether  the  arbitral  award  must  be  set  aside.  When  Section  40(2)"
"requires Court to grant the parties named as Respondents a date to state their objections,"
"if any, in writing supported by affidavit, the objections must state the objections to the"
"setting  aside  of  the  arbitral  award  and  no  more.  The  jurisdiction  that  the  High  Court"
"exercises  in  such  application  is  limited  to  determine  whether  the  award  should  be  set"
"aside."
"The  decision  in  Lanka  Orix  Leasing  Company  Ltd  v.  Weeratunge  [(2019)  1  Sri  LR  528]"
"supports this approach. There an application was made to the High Court to enforce an"
"arbitral award under Section 31 of the Act. The respondent filed a statement of objections"
"wherein he pleaded inter alia that the award was not a valid award, the award had not"
"been served on him, and that he had been tricked into signing the settlement forming the"
"basis of the award. The respondent had not made an application to set aside the award"
"under section 32 of the Act."
"After inquiry, the High Court made order rejecting all of the objections pleaded by the"
"respondent.  However,  the  High  Court  went  on  to  consider  whether  the  award  was"
"contrary to the public policy of Sri Lanka and held that the award was contrary to public"
"policy and dismissed the appellant's application for enforcement of the award."
"In appeal, the Supreme Court held that (supra. at 529) when an application to enforce an"
"arbitral award is made to the Court in conformity with Sections 31(1) to 31(5) of the Act,"
"Section 31 (6) requires the Court to file the award and give judgment and enter decree"
"according  to  the  award  unless  there  is  an  application  pending  determination  made  by"
"another party to the arbitration to set aside the award under Section 32, or the Court sees"
"cause to refuse the recognition and enforcement of the award under Sections 33 and 34."
"Court went on to hold that a party who wishes to set aside an arbitral award made in Sri"
"Lanka must file an application under Section 32(1) within sixty days of that party receiving"
"the award. The Court acting ex mero motu may set aside an award on the ground that it"
"is in conflict with the public policy of Sri Lanka under Section 32(1)(b)(ii), but based strictly"
"upon the material placed before the court and only in the course of an application made"
"under Section 32(1)."
