ARGUED ON : 11th November, 2021 DECIDED ON : 25th July, 2025 ********** ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is a direct appeal, preferred by the Plaintiff-Appellant-

Company (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff Company), against the

judgment of the Commercial High Court dated 28.03.2013, by which its

action was dismissed. The Commercial High Court accepted the claim of

the Defendant-Respondent-Company (hereinafter referred to as the

Defendant Company) that the said action is prescribed.

In instituting the instant action before the said High Court on

01.11.2010, the Plaintiff Company had averred in its Plaint that the

Defendant Company is wrongfully and unlawfully in breach of its

obligation, in its failure or neglect to pay a sum of Rs. 6,034,241.35 and

therefore a cause of action accrued to sue that Company to recover the

same. The Plaintiff Company accordingly prayed inter alia from the trial

Court to grant a Judgment and Decree in a sum of Rs. 6,034,241.35,

together with further interest at 16% per annum in a sum of Rs.

3,900,000.00, from 01.11.2010, until the date of the Decree and thereafter a

further interest at 16% per annum on the aggregate amount of the Decree

until payment in full.

The Plaintiff Company was involved in a travel trade and had some

of its financial requirements being served by Pramuka Management and

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

4

Financial Services Ltd., an entity which was re-named Pramuka Merchant

Corporation in November 2000 and once more changed the name to its

present form, Sterling Merchant Investments Ltd., in July 2003. It is stated in

the Plaint that the Plaintiff Company made two fixed deposits with the

Defendant Company, bearing Nos. 2002/MMB/035 and 2002/MMB/058

for a sum of Rs. 2,400,000.00 and Rs. 1,500,000.00 respectively at an interest

rate of 16% per annum, on 08.02.2022. These two deposits were to mature

on 06.01.2003.

In addition to the said two fixed deposits, the Plaintiff Company

also obtained two Term Loans from the Defendant Company, amounting

to a sum of Rs. 1,796,000.00 (Term Loan No. 1) and Rs. 1,500,000.00 (Term

Loan No. 2), along with a bank guarantee of Rs. 8,000,000.00, issued by

Pramuka Bank Ltd. The two fixed deposits of the Plaintiff Company were

held under a lien by the Defendant Company in respect of those term loan

facilities. The Plaintiff Company claims that the total yield of the two fixed

deposits, once reached maturity, amounts to Rs. 4,524,000.00. The Plaintiff

Company wrote to the Defendant Company on 14.12.2004, informing latter

to make the necessary arrangements to pay the balance of the capital and

accrued interest to the former, after settling its dues under two term loan

facilities.

Instead of complying with the said direction, the Defendant

Company chose to set off the total outstanding amount due to it on the

two term loans, amounting to a sum of Rs. 1,363,369.11, against the total

sum payable on the maturity of the said two fixed deposits and proceeded

to re-invest the balance sum of Rs. 3,160,630.89 with them. The Plaintiff

Company was in agreement with the act of the Defendant Company in

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

5

setting off its dues under Term Loans but demanded that the balance from

sum of Rs. 3,160,630.89 due on the said two placements to be paid in full.

Since then, the Defendant Company, apart from making two part-

payments (the last of which was made on 14.11.2007), had wrongfully and

unlawfully neglected to make the balance payment in full, due on the

Plaintiff Company on capital and interest of the said two fixed deposits.

The Plaintiff Company, by its letter dated 09.11.2007, called upon the

Defendant Company to make the full payment.

The Defendant Company, in its answer, whilst moving Court to

dismiss the Plaint of the Plaintiff Company, stated that the re-investment

of the remaining amount due to the Plaintiff Company on the two fixed

deposits was made with the concurrence of the latter, who since accepted

the payments that were made from time to time, under the re-payment

scheme, and therefore is estopped from claiming a contrary position. The

Defendant Company also pleaded in its answer that the cause of action

disclosed by the Plaintiff Company is already prescribed.

Parties proceeded to trial on a total of 20 issues raised and accepted

by Court. Issue No. 19 in particular, had dealt with the question whether

the cause of action of the Plaintiff Company is prescribed.

The trial Court, in delivering its judgment, now being impugned by

the Plaintiff Company in this appeal, was of the view it can safely be

concluded that the first time the plaintiff wrote to the defendant specifying the

amount the defendant Company was willing to pay in terms of the said two

placements (the two fixed deposits) was not by letter X11(a) dated 09.11.2007,

but by letter X2 dated 21.03.2003. The plaintiff instituted this action on

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

6

01.11.2010. The action has been filed 6 years after the breach of the Agreement and

therefore prescribed in law. The trial Court thereupon proceeded to dismiss

the action instituted by the Plaintiff Company.

In coming to the said conclusion, the trial Court considered the

evidence presented before it in both oral and documentary forms and

reproduced the positions advanced by the Plaintiff Company regarding

the issue raised on prescription.

During the hearing of the instant appeal, learned Counsel for the

Plaintiff Company accepted the ruling made by the trial Court that the

cause of action is based on a written contract and as such the applicable

period of prescription is a period of six years. However, the learned

Counsel contended that the said Court was in clear error when it

concluded that the date on which the alleged breach of the agreement

committed by the Defendant Company should be reckoned with, in the

determination of the issue on prescription.

Learned Counsel, in support of the said contention, invited attention

of this Court to the judgment of the trial Court where it deals with the

position of the Plaintiff Company placed before that Court. The relevant

section of the impugned judgment reads [I] cannot accept that, the

defendant, on 09.11.2007, by X11(a) and Attachment thereto X11(b), for the first

time wrote to the plaintiff specifying the amount the defendant company was

willing to pay in terms of the said two placements. As the witness for the

defendant stated in evidence and so stated in X11(a), the letter X11(a) and X11(b)

are based on X2, which is a letter sent by the defendant to the plaintiff dated

21.03.2003 and, upon this reasoning, the Court reached the conclusion

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

7

that, it was by letter X2, dated 21.03.2003, the Defendant Company had

indicated its willingness to pay the specified amounts contained therein for

the first time, in terms of the written agreement (emphasis original).

The complaint of the Plaintiff Company regarding the correctness of

the process of reasoning adopted by the trial Court contained in the said

section of the judgment, is that the Court below, in adopting the said

process of reasoning, had fallen in to grave error, in its failure to consider

the evidence placed before it on behalf of that Company, in the form of a

series of correspondence between the two Companies, which clearly

indicate that there had been regular acknowledgement of the debt by the

Defendant Company, the most recent being on 01.03.2008, and therefore

the action instituted on 01.11.2010, is well within the applicable period of

six years, within which such an action should be instituted. Learned

Counsel relied on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Saparamadu and

another v Peoples Bank (2002) 2 Sri L.R. 15, in support of his submission

by placing reliance on where it is stated (at p. 19), [E]ven where the period of

prescription has expired a part payment or an acceptance of the sum which was

due would take the case out of the operation of the enactment which prescribes the

time within which an action ought to be brought. Part payment into the account of

the Bank on which the monies were transacted is a renunciation of the benefit of

prescription.

Learned Counsel for the Defendant Company, in his endeavour of

supporting the impugned judgment of the trial Court, contended that the

witness who gave evidence before the trial Court on its behalf had

categorically stated that the documents X11(a) and X11(b) are only a

reconciliation statements and therefore cannot be taken as an independent

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

8

documents to that of X2 and the references that were made in these two

documents were in fact and essentially based on the figures contained in

the document X2, as correctly held by the trial Court.

During the hearing of the appeal, learned Counsel for the Plaintiff

Company as well as the Defendant Company have conceded that the

applicable period of prescription in relation to the instant appeal is six

years. Thus, the only question they are at variance with is the date on

which the said prescription period should start to run.

Thus, in view of these two competing contentions, it is important

this Court to determine the question whether the trial Court was in error

when it concluded that the alleged breach of Agreement occurred when

the Defendant Company failed to act on its undertaking to pay the

amounts specified in the document X2, issued in the year 2003 or whether

there had been a subsequent acknowledgement of the debt by that

Company, which takes the action of the Plaintiff Company, out of the

relevant period of prescription.

It might be helpful to the reader if I were to make at least a notional

reference to each of these documents that were relied on by the parties

during their respective submissions, both in support as well as in

opposition, in relation to the issue of prescription.

I shall commence my consideration with an examination of the

contents of the documents marked X11(a), X11(b) and X3, according to

which the Commercial High Court had decided that the year in which the

alleged breach of the agreement as 2003. The document X11(a) is a letter

addressed by the Defendant Company to the Defendant Company on

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

9

9.11.2007, by which it informed the reasons for the delay in responding to a

previous correspondence, presumably of the Plaintiff Company, by stating

that it was due to the change of ownership and management of the

Company. The Defendant Company further stated that it is a Statement of

Reconciliation and notified the Plaintiff Company that the accrued

interest outstanding as at 31.07.2003 of Rs. 509,867.77, Rs. 500,000.00 has been

transferred to capital, and the total balance payable on the above two placements as

notified to you is Rs. 1,911,720.24.

The letter X11(a) in its last paragraph stated that we propose to

bring the Travel Club (Pvt) Ltd. in line with all the other placement holders, and

propose to refund 20% of the total placement value capitalized amounting to

Rs.382,344.04. The amount refundable after recovering an adjustment of Rs.

11,896.81 on account of unpaid interest due on loans amounts to Rs. 370,447.23.

We propose to make an immediate payment of Rs. 200,000.00 and the balance of

Rs. 170,447.23 payable by the end of November 2007. The next refund for the

placement holders is planned for January 2008 and details of this will be notified

later.

The document X11(b) is a Statement of Account, as referred to in

X11(a) and the document X2, on which the trial Court acted, is dated

21.03.2003 and addressed to the Plaintiff Company. It appears from the

contents of the first part of that letter was to explain the circumstances

under which the transition of the management of the Defendant Company

had taken place and informs the latter that it has taken over the

responsibility of honouring the payments of the placements you have made with

Pramuka Merchant Corporation Ltd..

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

10

But, in the concluding paragraph of X2, the Defendant Company

states that Sterling Merchant Investments Limited foresee that a minimum

period of 12 months is necessary to restructure the business operations of the

Company and to honour our commitments towards our valued customers. In

order for us to carry out this proposed restructuring we kindly request you to re-

invest the captioned placements with us for a further period of 12 months. Until

such time we will continue to pay the contracted interest rate up to the date of

maturity and thereafter at the prevailing market rates. Further, we are making

arrangements to pay the interest on matured placements to clients who wish to

obtain interest payments on matured placements on or before 30th April 2003.

Now I turn my attention to the contents of the letters that were

relied on by the Plaintiff Company in support of its position that there had

been subsequent acknowledgements of debt on the part of the Defendant

Company. Learned Counsel for the Plaintiff Company submitted that the

latest of such acknowledgements is reflected in the letter dated 01.03.2008

(X13) by which the Defendant Company admits that its liability over the

placement value as per the plan was Rs. 1,911,720.24 and thus, its action

against the latter was instituted well within the required period of six

years.

The letter X13, is a response by the Defendant Company to a letter

sent by the Plaintiff Company dated 25.01.2008 and sets down the several

important events that had taken place since its letter dated 03.01.2003

(X6) addressed to the Plaintiff Company, arranged in a chronological

order. Paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the letter X13 are of relevance to the issue

to be determined and are reproduced below.

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

2. Your deposits had been re-invested at a yield of 13.5% p.a. as

notified in the letter dated 3rd January 2003. Accordingly,

interest up to 31.07.2003 has been added as per the statement.

3. Thereafter, you have been advised of the amounts outstanding

on your placements at the time of the announcement of the

restructuring plan in July 2003. Your placement value as per

the plan was Rs. 1,911,720.24. How this is arrived at is also

shown on the reconciliation statement.

4&5 Accordingly, the amounts refunded in November 2003,

February 2004, and 20% refunded thereafter are all explained

in our letter dated 9th November 2007. You have been

refunded 30% of your placements to-date as per all other

placement holders of this Company, and you have accepted

these payments as and when refunded, without objection.

The purpose of reproducing the contents of these letters exchanged

between the Plaintiff Company and the Defendant Company was to assess

the correctness of the claim made by the former that they are in fact

acknowledgements of debt that would bring its action within the

prescriptive period, in the light of the relevant judicial precedents.

The relevant law on this regard is found in Section 6 of the

Prescription Ordinance, which sets out the limitation period on written

contracts states that no action shall be maintainable unless such action

shall be brought within six years from the date of the breach of such partnership

deed or of such written promise, contract, bargain, or agreement, or other written

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

12

security, or from the date when such note or bill shall have become due, or of the

last payment of interest thereon.

In describing the cause of action on which it sued the Defendant

Company, the Plaintiff Company states in its Plaint (at paragraphs 18, 19

and 20) that the former owes the latter a sum of Rs. 6,034,241.35 (as at

31.10.2010) in respect of the two fixed deposits it had maintained with

them, as reflected in the Statement Accounts P10, which is annexed to the

said Plaint. Since the Defendant Company, in breach of its obligation

wrongfully and unlawfully failed or neglected to pay the said sum, a cause

of action has accrued to the Plaintiff Company.

In effect, the Plaintiff Company maintains its cause of action against

the Defendant Company accrued to it in the year 2008, and raised issue

No. 8 based on that claim, which reads as follows;

8. As set out in paragraph 17 of the Plaint;

(a) Has the defendant by letters dated 09.11.2007

[P7/ X11(a)] and 01.03.2008 [P9/X13] admitted

and accepted its liability to pay the moneys due

to the plaintiff upon the said two investment

placements?

(b) If so, is the defendant estopped in law and in fact

from:

(i) denying its liability to pay the plaintiff?

(ii) pleading that the cause of action of the

plaintiff is prescribed?

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

13

The Commercial High Court answered issue No. 8(a) as yes, but on

restructuring scheme whilst answering issue Nos. 8(b)(i) and 8(b)(ii) as the

Defendant Company does not deny on the restructuring scheme and

defendant can, respectively. The issues that were raised by the Defendant

Company seeking to counter the said issue No. 8, are the issue Nos. 14, 15,

16 17 and 18, which based on its claim that the Plaintiff Company agreed

with the new investment plan it had proposed on 21.03.2003. The High

Court specifically found that the Defendant Company had proceeded to

act on the re-structuring plan it had formulated, disregarding the

objections repeatedly raised by the Plaintiff Company to the

implementation of such a plan.

Thus, the Commercial High Court arrived at the conclusion that the

cause of action, although claimed by the Plaintiff Company in its Plaint to

have accrued in the year 2008 on X 13, the oral and documentary evidence

presented before it clearly points to the conclusion that it in fact accrued in

2003, with the issuance of X2 by the Defendant Company and, when the

instant action was instituted in November 2010, it is clearly time barred by

operation of the statutory provisions contained in Section 6 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

The said conclusion reached by the trial Court is a justifiable

conclusion in view of the evidence presented by the parties. In order to

consider the contents of the correspondence between the parties in its

proper perspective, it is necessary to set out the circumstances under

which the documents X2, X11(a) and X11(b) were issued.

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

14

The genesis of the present dispute could be traced back to a bank

guarantee issued on behalf of the Plaintiff Company by Pramuka Savings &

Development Bank. On 28.10.2002, the Country Manager of the airline

Cathey Pacific, requested the Plaintiff Company to furnish a new bank

guarantee (X8). The Plaintiff Company requested the Defendant Company

to arrange a bank guarantee by letter dated 14.11.2002, but there was no

meaningful action taken, compelling the former to write to latter (X10)

once more on 15.11.2002 informing that Pramuka Savings & Development

Bank has ceased operations temporarily the guarantees issued through the bank

have been dishonoured. Importantly, the Plaintiff Company also made a

request in that letter to release the deposits with interest to us immediately

to substitute the guarantees through another bank. By this time, the two fixed

deposits that were made on 06.01.2002, for a period of 365 days, were to

mature within the next few weeks (date of maturity was in fact 06.01.2003).

Clearly, the Plaintiff Company made its intentions clear on the fate

of its deposits held by the Defendant Company for the first time by this

letter X10, which was followed by another letter dated 14.12.2002 (X5)

making a request to the latter to deduct the balance due from our fixed

deposit to cover the loan instalments of Rs. 119,252.24 and to make

necessary adjustments as to the balance due to it. The Defendant

Companys response to the said requests of returning the balance of the

two deposits, after deducting whatever dues, was informing the Plaintiff

Company of the fact that the balance amount of Rs. 3,160,630.89 will be re-

invested for a period of 6 months at a yield of 13.5% p.a. and it also

assured that every effort will be made to forward the above balance payment

due to you at the earliest possible time (vide letter dated 03.01.2003, tendered

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

15

as X6). The Plaintiff Company, by its letter dated 09.01.2003 (X6),

indicating it is not agreeable to the proposed re-investment plan and

renewed its request to make arrangements to refund the capital and

remaining interest.

Then comes a series of correspondence that indicate the Defendant

Company, totally ignoring the demands of the Plaintiff Company,

proceeded along its re-structuring plan after re-investing the balance from

the two fixed deposits (X2, X3, X11(a), X14, X16, X17, X18 and X19).

The letter dated 02.09.2003 (X20) stands out from the said series of

correspondence as for the first time, the Plaintiff Company forewarns the

Defendant Company that it would reluctantly compelled to resort to legal

action if the latter persisted with its actions any further. This letter was

followed by another letter sent on 26.09.2003 (X 21), demanding an

immediate return of the dues. Then the letter (X22), was sent to the

Defendant Company on 17.11.2003 with the title FINAL REMINDER

once more demanding to refund the dues. It also reminded the Defendant

Company once more that we will be reluctantly compelled to resort to legal

action in order to recover all our dues with accrued interest and cost.

Since the instant action was instituted on 01.11.2010, by working

back on the prescriptive period of six years, the cause of action on which

the Plaintiff Company sued the Defendant Company ought to have

accrued before 01.11.2004.

When the Plaintiff Company wrote the letters X20, X21 and X23, it

was fully aware that the Defendant Company had no intentions to depart

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

16

from the re-structuring plan it has put in place and thereafter implemented

to ensure the continuity of its commercial operations.

Thus, the conclusion reached by the trial Court that the dispute

arose well before six years from the date on which the action was

instituted, is a conclusion which could be justified, in view of the available

evidence.

It is apparent from the contention advanced by the learned Counsel

for the Plaintiff Company that it does not seriously canvass the validity of

that finding but rather opts to attribute a fault on the trial Court, on its

failure to consider the subsequent acknowledgements of debt, which it

should have, before proceeding to dismiss its action as time barred. Thus,

the Plaintiff Company thereby makes an attempt to bring its case within

Section 12 of the Prescription Ordinance by placing reliance on its

provisions that reads no acknowledgement or promise by words only shall

be deemed evidence of a new or continuing contract, whereby to take the case out

of the operation of enactments contained in the said Sections on the strength of

the documents X11(a), X20, X21 and X23.

Perusal of the judgment and the answers provided to the several

issues by the Commercial High Court, it is difficult to accept the said

proposition of the Plaintiff Company. It is already noted that the issue

Nos. 14, 15, 16 17 and 18 of the Defendant Company were based on its

claim that the Plaintiff Company had agreed with the new investment plan

it had proposed on 21.03.2003. Answers to issue No. 8(a), as well as to

issue Nos. 14, 15 and 18 clearly indicate the trial Court was mindful of the

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

17

subsequent developments over the initial dispute that already erupted

between the parties in 2003.

The issue No. 14 was raised on the basis that the Plaintiff Company

agreed with the interest due on the fixed deposits be payable upon

maturity after setting off its dues on the loan facilities, the Court answered

Plaintiff agreed only as per X5. The document X5 is a letter by which the

Plaintiff Company informed the Defendant Company that it could deduct

the monthly instalment of Rs. 119,252.24 from the accrues interest due

from the two fixed deposits. Similarly, when the Defendant Company

raised the issue No. 15 to read have the agreements entered into between

the plaintiff and the defendant in terms of the documents marked P2A [X3(a)] and

P2B [X3(b)], been renewed ?, the Court answered the issue in the

affirmative but with the qualification that the renewal was on a

different basis (vide X2) to which the plaintiff did not agree. Issue No. 18(a) of

the Defendant Company was to the effect whether the plaintiff not made

any objection to the new investment plan proposed by the defendant ? was

answered as Plaintiff did repeatedly whereas issue No. 18(b), raised on the

point whether the plaintiff obtained benefits in terms of the new investment

plan proposed by the defendant without raising any active objection to the same?,

the Court answered the same with obtained part payments without accepting

the rescheduled scheme.

A factual position similar to the one presented before this Court in

relation to the instant appeal, was presented before a bench of Dalton J and

Drieberg J, in Hoare & Company v Rajaratnam (1932) 34 NLR 219. In this

matter the defendant had written to the plaintiff Company a letter (P1) on

28.09.1928, stating In reply to your letter of 5th instant, on account of rubber

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

18

prices, you will have to wait another couple of months for settlement. The

plaintiff Company, in its reply to P1, declined to grant any further time

and asks the defendant for a cheque in settlement.

The District Court held P1 to be an unconditional promise to pay on

the expiration of two months from the date of the letter and that the Plaint

being filed on 30.10.1929 is not prescribed. Dalten J accepted that the P1 is

indicative of an acknowledgement of debt by the defendant he owed to the

plaintiff Company, but differed with the trial Court finding that it is an

unconditional promise by stating that (at p. 220), [I] am unable to agree with

the learned trial Judge that the letter was an unconditional promise to pay at the

expiration of two months. It is an acknowledgment of the defendant's indebtedness

at the date the letter was written, to which has been added an intimation that he

cannot raise the money for two months, implying a request to the plaintiff firm to

wait for that time, which request was refused.

After citing the judgment of Buckmaster v. Russell 10 C. B. N. S. (at

p. 750) quoting from Philips v. Philips 3 Hare (at p. 299), in which the

applicable law is very concisely set out, Dalten J states as follows (at p.

221);

The legal effect of an acknowledgment of a debt barred by the

statute of limitation is that of a promise to pay the old debt, and for

this purpose the old debt may be said to be revived. It is revived as a

consideration for a new promise. But the new promise and not the

old debt is the measure of the creditor's right. If a debtor simply

acknowledges an old debt, the law implies from that simple

acknowledgment a promise to pay, for which promise the old debt is

a sufficient consideration. But if the debtor promises to pay the old

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

19

debt when he is able, or by instalments, or in two years, or out of a

particular fund, the creditor can claim nothing more than the

promise given him.

Dalten J went on to state further that [T]he fact that to the

acknowledgment is added a request for time (to be distinguished, be it noted, from

a promise to pay within a definite time), does not, it seems to me, make the

acknowledgment any less a promise to pay. Having noted that the request for

couple of months to pay the debt was refused by the plaintiff Company,

nevertheless seeking to obtain as against the defendant the benefit of those two

months for itself in order to prevent the bar of prescription from running, when it

refused the request of the defendant to allow him the two months he asked for.

In view of these considerations Dalten J held (at p.221) that [T]here is

no doubt that the firm could have sued the defendant to recover the debt at once.

To hold defendant bound by his offer or request to pay after the lapse of two

months, when his request had been definitely rejected by the other side, would be

unjust, .

Returning to the facts of the instant appeal, it is with the letter dated

14.12.2002 (X5) under the title LOAN AMOUNTS: RS. 1,697,000/- & RS.

1,500,000/- , INSTALMENTS:RS. 63,542/24 & RS. 55,710/- Per month the

Plaintiff Company written to the Defendant Company issuing instructions

that [W]e write with reference to the above Instalments of Rs. 119,25,.24 per

month due on the above loan, and kindly request you to deduct the balance due

from our Fixed Deposit bearing numbers: 2002 MMB 35 & 2002 MMB 58

amounting to Rs. 3,900,000/- with accrued interest as at 27th December 2002,

being the maturity date of the Fixed Deposit. The letter X5 also contains a

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

20

request made by the Plaintiff that states [W]e would appreciate your

intimation after making necessary adjustments, as to the balance due to us on

same.

The letter X5 is clear in its meaning. The Plaintiff Company wants to

have the capital and interest due from the two deposits made, and after

deducting the dues to the Defendant Company, the balance to be paid to

them.

The Defendant Company responded to letter X5, with the letter

dated 03.01.2003 (X6) under the heading Credit Facilities and Placements

with PMCL. In that letter the Defendant Company clearly informed the

Plaintiff Company what it intends to do with regard to the instructions

issued by the latter by letter X5. The relevant sections of the letter X5 are

reproduced below as this forms the core of the issue that was argued

before this Court;

You will appreciate the fact due to the circumstances which prevail,

we are unable to forward the payment for capital and yield in respect

of the said placements. Therefore, as requested by you we are

agreeable to recover the total outstanding due on the term loan

facilities as at 06th January 2003 amounting to Rs. 1,363, 369/11

from the amounts payable on the placements.

The balance amount of Rs. 3,160,630/89 will be reinvested for a

period of 6 months at a yield rate of 13.5% p.a.

However, we assure you that every effort will be made to forward the

above balance payment due to you at the earliest possible time.

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

21

The Plaintiff Company was not at all pleased with the contents of

the reply letter sent by the Defendant Company. The Plaintiff Company

wrote to the Defendant Company on 09.01.2003 (X7) totally rejecting the

proposed re-investment of the balance sum due and demanding its

payment, stating [W]e write with reference to your fax dated 3rd January 2003

received by us on 8th January 2003, and the subsequent conversation I had with

you, and regret we are not agreeable for a reinvestment of Rs. 3, 160, 630/89, and

would like to request you to make arrangements as agreed to refund the said

amount withing the next 7-10 days.

Therefore, as in the case of Hoare & Company v Rajaratnam (supra)

where the plaintiff Company demanded its due from the defendant, who

then wrote P1, whilst acknowledging the debt, subject to the condition that

it will have to wait another couple of months for settlement, in this instance

too when the Plaintiff Company sends X5, the Defendant Company, whilst

acknowledging the debt, imposes a condition that The balance amount of

Rs. 3,160,630/89 will be reinvested for a period of 6 months at a yield rate of

13.5% p.a. Thus, it is a conditional acknowledgement of debt and is

qualified to be taken in as Dalton J observed [B]ut if the debtor promises to

pay the old debt when he is able, or by instalments, or in two years, or out of a

particular fund, the creditor can claim nothing more than the promise given him.

The vital part of the comparison is, similar to what the plaintiff Company

did in Hoare & Company v Rajaratnam (supra) by rejecting the letter of

the defendant P1, here too the Plaintiff Company made its intentions clear

when it conveyed that we are not agreeable for a reinvestment of Rs. 3, 160,

630/89, and would like to request you to make arrangements as agreed to refund

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

22

the said amount withing the next 7-10 days, which aligns with the

observation made by Dalton J that having refused the request for couple of

months to pay the debt made by the defendant, the plaintiff Company,

nevertheless sought to obtain as against the defendant the benefit of those

two months for itself in order to prevent the bar of prescription from running,

when it refused the request of the defendant to allow him the two months he asked

for.

In the instant appeal too, the Plaintiff Company relied on X20 to X22

to prevent the bar of prescription from running against its action, which

then attracts the principle on which the Court determined the appeal in

Hoare & Company v Rajaratnam (supra), namely [T]here is no doubt that

the firm could have sued the defendant to recover the debt at once. To hold

defendant bound by his offer or request to pay after the lapse of two months, when

his request had been definitely rejected by the other side, would be unjust, .

Dreiberg J, while concurring with the said conclusion added that (p. 223);

In this case the respondent's claim that the condition has been

fulfilled for the reason that they brought this action within a year of

the expiry of the two months requested in P 1, but can they by now

saying that they observed the conditions gain the benefit of the

promise which they had expressly rejected? The case of Buckmaster

v. Russell (1861) 10 C. B. new series 746 and 4 L. J. 552, is a direct

authority to the contrary; it was there held that a special promise is

one which will not bind unless accepted by the plaintiff to whom it is

preferred, and that where a proposal is rejected it cannot be relied on

as an acknowledgment to bar the statute.

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

23

The position of the Plaintiff Company, that it was by letter dated

09.11.2007 X11(a) only the Defendant Company acknowledged the debt it

owes to the former, was rejected by the Commercial High Court. It then

proceeded to dismiss the action as prescribed. The trial Court did so on the

basis that the acknowledgement of debt was not by letter X11(a) dated

09.11.2007 but by letter X2 dated 21.03.2003 issued well over seven years.

This conclusion reached by the Commercial High Court upon

adopting the said reasoning is justified. With the receipt of the letter dated

03.01.2003 (X6), the Plaintiff Company could have sued the Defendant to

recover the debt at once. In the year 2003, the Plaintiff Company had

written to the Defendant Company issuing a final reminder to latter that

they will be reluctantly compel to resort to legal action to in order to recover

all our dues with accrued interest. But they did so, only in October 2010,

despite the fact that date of maturity of the two fixed deposits was in fact

06.01.2003, on which fact the cause of action the Plaintiff Company of

refusal to pay was founded on.

The series of subsequent correspondence, including X11(a), X 20, X

21 and X22 are merely a reiteration of the stubborn refusal of the

Defendant Company to pay its debt to the Plaintiff Company reiterating its

already indicated position by sending X6, therefore does not accrue a new

cause of action by renewing an old debt, and extending the period of

limitation with the issuance of each of these letters.

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

24

Therefore, in my view that the facts of the Hoare & Company v

Rajaratnam (supra), are almost identical with the facts of the instant

appeal and thus, the principle of law, which the Court acted on then,

applies to the instant matter as well. This Court had consistently relied on

the reasoning of that judgment where the issue before Court was whether

there was an acknowledgement of debt, whether conditional or otherwise,

that either could be inferred or established through evidence ( vide

judgements of Triad Advertising Pvt Ltd., v Attorney General (SC Appeal

No. 48/2013 decided on 26.07.2024) and Wijitha Group of Companies

(Private) Ltd., v Capital Paintpack (Private) Ltd., (SC Appeal No.

21/2017 decided on 09.06.2023)

In Kahandawa Appuhamilage Don Tilakaratne v Wijesinghe

Mudiyanselage Chandarasiri and another (SC Appeal No. 48/2013

decided on 27.01.2017), in view of the judgment of Hoare & Company v

Rajaratnam (supra), this Court cited that a plaintiff is not to be allowed to

rely upon a ground of exemption from the law of limitation raised for the first time

in the Appeal Court.

The judgment of Sampath Bank PLC v Kaluarachchi Sasitha

Palitha (SC Appeal No. 196/2011 decided on 09.09.2019), where Murdu

N.B. Fernando J,( as she then was), in relation to the correctness of the

reliance placed on the judgment of Hoare & Company v Rajaratnam

(supra) by the Court below, in coming to the conclusion that there was no

acknowledgement of debt, observed that [T]he facts of the appeal before us,

in my view cannot be compared with the above case.

S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013

25

In view of the foregoing, I am of the view that the appeal of the

Plaintiff Company is devoid of merit. The judgment of the Commercial

High Court is accordingly affirmed and the appeal of the Plaintiff

Company is dismissed.

I make no order as to costs.
