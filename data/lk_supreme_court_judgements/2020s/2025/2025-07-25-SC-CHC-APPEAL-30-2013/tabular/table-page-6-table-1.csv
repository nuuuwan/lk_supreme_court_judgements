"S.C. CHC Appeal No. 30/2013"
"01.11.2010. The action has been filed 6 years after the breach of the Agreement and"
"therefore prescribed in law.” The trial Court thereupon proceeded to dismiss"
"the action instituted by the Plaintiff Company."
"In  coming  to  the  said  conclusion,  the  trial  Court  considered  the"
"evidence  presented  before  it  in  both  oral  and  documentary 
forms  and"
"reproduced  the  positions  advanced  by  the  Plaintiff  Company  regarding"
"the issue raised on prescription."
"During  the  hearing  of  the  instant  appeal,  learned  Counsel  for  the"
"Plaintiff  Company  accepted  the  ruling  made  by  the  trial  Court  that  the"
"cause  of  action  is  based  on  a  written  contract  and  as  such  the  applicable"
"period  of  prescription 
is  a  period  of  six  years.  However,  the 
learned"
"Counsel  contended 
that 
the  said  Court  was 
in  clear  error  when 
it"
"concluded  that  the  date  on  which  the  alleged  breach  of  the  agreement"
"committed  by  the  Defendant  Company  should  be  reckoned  with,  in  the"
"determination of the issue on prescription."
"Learned Counsel, in support of the said contention, invited attention"
"of  this  Court  to  the  judgment  of  the  trial  Court  where  it  deals  with  the"
"position  of  the  Plaintiff  Company  placed  before  that  Court.  The  relevant"
"cannot  accept 
that, 
the 
section  of 
the 
impugned 
judgment 
reads  “[I]"
"defendant, on 09.11.2007, by X11(a) and Attachment thereto X11(b), for the first"
"time  wrote  to  the  plaintiff  specifying  the  amount  the  defendant  company  was"
"willing  to  pay 
in  terms  of  the  said  two  placements.  As  the  witness 
for  the"
"defendant stated in evidence and so stated in X11(a), the letter X11(a) and X11(b)"
"are  based  on  X2,  which  is  a  letter  sent  by  the  defendant  to  the  plaintiff  dated"
"21.03.2003”  and,  upon  this  reasoning,  the  Court  reached  the  conclusion"
"6"
