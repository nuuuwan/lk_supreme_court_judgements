"renewed 
its  request  to  make  arrangements  to  refund

"remaining interest."
"Then  comes  a  series  of  correspondence  that  indicate  the  Defendant"
"Company,

"correspondence as for the first time, the  Plaintiff Company forewarns the"
"Defendant  Company  that  it  would  “reluctantly  compelled  to  resort  to  legal"
"action”  if  the  latter  persisted  with  its  actions  any  further.  This  letter  was"
"followed  by  another 
letter  sent  on  26.09.2003

"once more demanding to refund the dues. It also reminded the Defendant"
"Company once more that “… we will be reluctantly compelled to resort to legal"
"action in order to recover all our dues with accrued interest and cost.”"
"Since  the  instant  action  was  instituted  on  01.11.2010,  by  working"
"back on the prescriptive period of six years, the cause  of action on which"

"When  the  Plaintiff  Company  wrote  the  letters  X20,  X21  and  X23,  it"
"was fully aware that the Defendant Company had no intentions to depart"
