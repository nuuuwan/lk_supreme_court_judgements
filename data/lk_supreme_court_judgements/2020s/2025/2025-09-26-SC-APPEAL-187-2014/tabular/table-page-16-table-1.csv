"48.","This principle strikes at
the very
root of
the Respondents’
contention that once an"
"","internal computation is made,
the Notice of Assessment can lawfully be served at any"
"","later
time.
If
such an argument were to prevail,
the Assessor
could,
long after
the"
"","statutory deadline of 31st March 2008, generate or even backdate a document and"
"","present
it as an “assessment,”
thereby reducing the time bar
in Section 134(5) of
the"
"","2000 Act
to a hollow formality. The law cannot permit
taxpayers
to be held in such"
"","perpetual suspense."
"49.","The Respondents rely on the English decision of Honig and Others (administrators of"
"","Emmanuel Honig)
v
Sarsfield
(H M Inspector
of
Taxes),7
first
decided
in
the"

certificate in the official
assessment book on 16th"
"","March 1970, but
the notices were only served after 7th April 1970. The court held that"
"","the
assessments were
nevertheless
in

because
they were
“made” when
the"
"","Inspector
signed
the
book,
and
not when
the
notices were
served.
The
court’s"
"","Taxes
reasoning
rested
squarely
on
the
specific
statutory
framework
of
the"
"","Management
Act, which
expressly
distinguished
between
the
act
of
“making”
an"
"","assessment (by entry in the register) and the subsequent requirement to give notice."
"50.","It is evident
that the English procedure was markedly different from the scheme under"
"","the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000. Under
the UK legislation,
the Inspector was"
"","statutorily obliged to maintain an assessment
register,
