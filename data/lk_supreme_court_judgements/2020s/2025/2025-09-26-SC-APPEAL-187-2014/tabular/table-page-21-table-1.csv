"64.","The present case is materially different. Upon the perusal of
the letter of
intimation"
"","dated 25th March 2008,
I
find that although styled as an “intimation,”
the said letter"
"","cannot by any measure be equated with a Notice of Assessment within the meaning of"
"","Section 134 of the Act. While it contains certain preliminary calculations, these workings"
"","cannot be framed as a final and binding determination of liability."
"65.","The letter neither quantifies a conclusive sum payable nor calls upon the Appellant
to"
"","discharge such liability; specifies a date by when the amount shall be settled; nor does"
"","it
set out
the statutory right of appeal, which is an essential
feature of a Notice of"
"","Assessment under
Section 136.
The
computations
appear
as
tentative workings
to"
"","support the Assessor’s non-acceptance of the return, rather than as the imposition of a"
"","charge. To treat
this document as an “assessment” would strip the taxpayer of vital"
"","procedural safeguards and reduce the statutory right of appeal
to an empty formality."
"","Therefore,
unlike
in
Illukkumbura,
where
the
intimation
itself
embodied
the"
"","assessment, the letter before us is no more than a preliminary communication—a step"
"","antecedent
to
assessment—and
cannot
be
given
the
legal
effect
of
a Notice
of"
"","Assessment."
"66.","These authorities, read together,
I hold that an “assessment” is not complete until
it
is"
"","communicated to the taxpayer by a notice of assessment served within the time limit."
"","The statutory time bar applies to the assessment as a whole,
including notice. A letter"
"","of intimation is not an assessment, nor is it an internal departmental calculation."
"67.","The
Department’s
shifting
positions,
sometimes
treating
as
an
intimation,
‘P4’"
"","sometimes as an assessment, sometimes asserting an internal making, only reveal
the"
"","absence of a lawful assessment within time. To permit such evasions would be to drain"
"","Section 134(5) of meaning and to expose taxpayers
to uncertainty
and unfairness."
