"","Commissioner- General to appeal the Commissioner-General’s assessment to the"
"","TAC.”20"
"78.","In aligning with these observations,
I,
too, am of
the view that
judicial
review is not a"
"","substitute for statutory appeal, but serves as a necessary safeguard where the statutory"
"","process
cannot
adequately
address
the question of
legality
or
jurisdiction.
In
the"

the Appellant challenged an assessment
issued on 11th June 2008, after"
"","the statutory deadline of 31st March 2008 under Section 134(5) of
the Inland Revenue"
"","Act, 2000. The challenge was primarily not
to the quantum of
tax, but
to the very"
"","authority of
the Commissioner General
to issue the assessment, which had expired by"
"","operation of law."
"79.","The
statutory
appeal mechanism is
limited
to
correcting
errors made within
the"
"","Commissioner’s lawful authority and cannot provide relief where the assessment
itself"
"","ultra

is
or
time-barred.
Requiring
the Appellant
to

"","themselves to the statutory appeal would have compelled it to participate in a process"
"","incapable of addressing the legal defect, even after
the CGIR explicitly refused to"
"","consider the time-bar in their reasons for determination marked ‘P15’
in the brief."
"","In such circumstances, where the statutory remedy would not have been practically"
"","effective for the Appellant, the requirements identified by Justice Aluwihare are met."
