"","(iv) whether the making of an assessment
in law is separate and distinct
from"
"","the giving of notice of such assessment in terms of section 134(3); and"
"","(v) whether
the Appellant
is
estopped from invoking the
jurisdiction of
the"
"","Court of Appeal having invoked the appellate procedure provided in the"
"","Act.”"
"23. Accordingly, Special Leave to Appeal has been granted on five questions of law, two at",""
"","the instance of
the Appellant and three at
the instance of
the Respondents, which are"
"","reproduced herein in full."
"","ANALYSIS"
"24. At","the outset,
I consider
it appropriate to deal
first with Questions of Law 2, 3, and 4,"
"","which directly concern the validity of the assessment in issue. These questions go to the"
"","root of
the matter,
for
if
the assessment
itself
is not validly made,
little purpose is"
"","served in examining the further objections. Thereafter,
I shall turn to Questions of Law 1"
"","and 5, which relate to the jurisdiction of
the Court of Appeal and the question of"
"","estoppel raised by the Respondents."
"","Was the assessment validly made within the meaning of
the Inland Revenue Act"
"","No. 38 of 2000?"
"25.","I shall now proceed to consider Questions of Law 3 and 4 together,
for they both turn"
"","on the core issue of when,
in law, an “assessment”
is to be regarded as having been"
"","made within the meaning of Section 134 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000."
"26.","Some of the questions of law presented to this Court go to the very heart of the social"
"","contract between a State and its taxpayers. They ask us to define the precise moment a"
"","tax liability is legally imposed and whether a public authority, vested with the power to"
"","enforce tax policies, can disregard a clear statutory deadline."
