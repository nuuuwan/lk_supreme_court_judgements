"","Parliament has not given the Department an indefinite licence to assess at leisure.
It has"
"","given three years, no more. The Department must act, and must notify, within that time."
"68.","There is a wider principle at stake, as I noted earlier. Taxation is a compulsory exaction"
"","backed by the coercive power of the State.
It is therefore imperative that the power to"
"","tax
be
exercised
strictly
in
accordance with
law,
and within
the
boundaries
the"
"","legislature has drawn. Time bars in tax law are not
technical
traps for the Department;"
"","they are jurisdictional
limits imposed in the interests of certainty, fairness, and discipline."
"69.","To
erode
them by
accepting secret
assessments
or delayed
notices would be
to"
"","unsettle commercial
life and to undermine confidence in the rule of
law. The letter"
"","dated 25th March 2008 was not an assessment. The notice dated 11th
June 2008 was"
"","issued without
jurisdiction. The power
to assess expired on the 31st March 2008 and"
"","could not be revived thereafter."
"70.","For
reasons
above,
I
answer Questions
3
and 4
in
the
negative, holding that
an"
"","assessment is not validly “made” unless it is notified to the taxpayer within the statutory"
"","time limit, and that a letter of intimation does not amount to such notification."
