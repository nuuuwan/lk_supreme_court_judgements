"73. At its core, this question concerns the proper role of the Court of Appeal
in supervising"
"administrative action and ensuring that public authorities act within the limits of
their"
"legal powers. The Constitution, under Article 140, clearly empowers the Court of Appeal"
"to issue Writs of Certiorari as a safeguard to enforce the rule of law. The mere existence"
"of a statutory appeal, which ordinarily addresses errors made within the lawful scope of"
"authority, does not limit or displace this constitutional power."
