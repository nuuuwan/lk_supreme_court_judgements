"","ledgers,
ink signatures, and manual registers, a world that has long passed. Today, with"
"","computerised
systems,
electronic
records,
and
instant
communication,
issuing
an"
"","assessment
takes only moments.
In this modern context,
there is no justification for"
"","outdated formalistic distinctions
that once excused delay or uncertainty. Technology"
"","now makes it possible to act with precision, speed, and transparency, yet taxpayers are"
"","still entitled to prompt and clear communication of their obligations.
It is evident in this"
"","instance that not every possible effort has been taken to ensure assessments are issued"
"","in a timely manner, and one is compelled to observe that
the seriousness of promptly"
"","communicating
assessments
to
taxpayers
has
not
been
fully
appreciated
by
a"
"","Department that is fully capacitated to do so, given the e-Services and digital platforms"
"","it has adopted."
"62.","I now move on to examining the decision in Illukkumbura Industrial Automation"
"","(Pvt) Ltd v. Commissioner General of
Inland Revenue16 where the Court of Appeal"
"","had dealt with the question as to whether a letter of
intimation issued under Section"
"","163(3) of
the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006,
could constitute evidence of an"
"","assessment."
"63.","The Court,
through Wijeratne J., held that, because the letter
in that case contained"
"","both a statement of
reasons for
rejecting the return and a quantified computation of"
"","estimated income,
it satisfied the statutory requirements and therefore amounted to an"
"","assessment made within
time.
The Court’s
reasoning turned on
the
fact
that
the"
"","intimation was not a bare notification but a document that in substance, combined two"
"","indispensable elements—reasons for
rejection and an explicit computation of
income"
"","tax liability."
