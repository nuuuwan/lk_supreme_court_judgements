"","issue of legal validity was a matter for the courts. This demonstrates that the Appellant"
"","never accepted the validity of
the assessment and preserved its right
to seek judicial"
"","review from the outset."
"84.","The Respondentsâ€™ claim of estoppel cannot stand. Estoppel requires two things: a clear"
"","promise or admission by one party, and the other party relying on it to their detriment."
"","Neither
is present here. The Appellant never accepted that
the assessment was valid,"
"","and the Respondents never changed their position because of anything the Appellant"
"","did. From the beginning, the Respondents insisted the assessment was within time, and"
"","the Appellant consistently disputed that. There was never any conduct by the Appellant"
"","that could be taken as an admission."
