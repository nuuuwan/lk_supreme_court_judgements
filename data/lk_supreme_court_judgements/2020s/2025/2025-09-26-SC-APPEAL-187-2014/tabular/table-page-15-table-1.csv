"44.","It may be noted that when the
learned Chief
Justice
said,
“[h]is
reasons must be"
"","communicated at or about the time he sends his assessment on an estimated income”,"
"","His Lordship referred to the “sending of
the notice of assessment”, since the internal"
"","assessment document, which remains
in the possession of
the Assessor,
is only an"
"","“estimate”
and is not
sent
to the taxpayer. Thus,
the act of
sending the notice of"
"","assessment, with the reasons,
is what completes the legal process."
"45.","This passage highlights two critical principles. First, the giving of reasons is not a mere"
"","procedural
formality;
it
is
a
substantive
requirement
ensuring that
the
assessment"
"","reflects a genuine,
considered decision by
the Assessor. Second,
the timing of
the"
"","communication is essential;
reasons must accompany the notice of assessment at
the"
"","moment the assessment is sent; failing which, the remedial purpose of the legislation is"
"","defeated.
It is noted that in the case at hand,
it was also the Appellant’s position at the"
"","stage of appeal
to the CGIR that
sufficient
reasons were not communicated for
the"
"","rejection."
"46.","The dissenting opinion, notably
that of Sharvananda J.
(as His
Lordship was
then),"
"","treated the communication of reasons as a ""directory"" step, suggesting that an internal"
"","assessment could stand even if
the reasons were communicated later. However,
this"
"","view did not carry the force of binding precedent, while the majority’s
reasoning is"
"","binding on this Court."
