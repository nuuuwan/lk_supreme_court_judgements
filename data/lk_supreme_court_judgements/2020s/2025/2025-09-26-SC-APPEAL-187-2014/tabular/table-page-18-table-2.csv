"55.","In John Keels Holdings PLC v. Commissioner General of","Inland Revenue,13 D.N."
"","Samarakoon J. held that
the operation of
the time bar","runs from the sending of
the"
"","notice of
assessment,
and not
from the mere making of","the assessment, unless
a"
"","","proper book or register is maintained to show clearly the date on which the assessment"
"","","was made. His Lordship therefore underscored that the notice of assessment itself must"
"","be issued within the statutory period of limitation.",""
