"14.","The Appellant,
by way
of

submissions
dated
23rd March
2010,
vehemently"
"","could not
in
law be
construed as
an
disputed this position, maintaining that P4"
"","assessment, and reiterating that the assessment was made only on 11th June 2008, well"
"","beyond the period of three years."
"15. On 1st","July 2010, a determination was
issued under
the delegated authority of
the"
"","Commissioner General of
Inland Revenue, which reduced the taxable income but did"
"","not address the time-bar objection."
"16.","By letter dated 6th
July 2010,
the Appellant communicated its dissatisfaction with this"
"","determination, as
required under Section 138(1) of
the Act. On 14th
July 2010, by a"
"","letter,
the Commissioner General
communicated the reasons
for
the determination,"
"","indicating expressly that questions concerning the legal validity of
the assessment—"
"","including the issue of time bar—would not be considered by him, as such matters were"
"","for judicial determination."
"17.","Pursuant to the said determination, the Appellant lodged a further appeal to the Board"
"","of Review under
the Act, which appeal
concerned the merits
and quantum of
the"
"","assessment.
This
appeal was pending at
the
time
the Appellant
invoked the Writ"
"","jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal."
"18. Accordingly,","the Appellant
filed CA (Writ) Application No. 663/2010 in the Court of"
"","Appeal seeking Writs of Certiorari
to quash the Notice of Assessment dated 11th June"
"","2008 and the determination dated 1st
July 2010, on the grounds,
inter alia,
that
the"
"","assessment was issued outside the statutory time limit and was therefore a nullity, and"
"","that the Commissioner General had failed to properly determine the appeal
lodged by"
"","the Appellant."
