"10.","The said letter, however, did not quantify any income or
tax liability, nor did it specify"
"","the computation of
taxable income, nor call upon the Appellant
to make payment of"
"","any sum.
It was described only as an “intimation,” and did not bear the hallmarks of an"
"","“assessment” in terms of law."
"11.","Subsequently, on
12th
June
2008, more
than
two months
after
the
expiry of
the"
"","statutory time bar,
the Appellant
received a ‘Notice of Assessment’ dated 11th
June"
"","to additional
income tax for
the
2008, marked P6, purporting to assess the Appellant"
"","Year of Assessment 2004/2005. This Notice specified the income assessed, provided"
"","reasons for the non-acceptance of
the return, and advised the Appellant of
its right of"
"","appeal under Section 136 of
the Act. The departmental
record marked 1R2 also bears"
"","the same date, confirming the making of this assessment on 11th June 2008."
"12.","The Appellant, being dissatisfied,
lodged an
appeal by
letter dated 9th
July
2008,"
"","Inland Revenue
marked P7 in the brief, addressed to the Commissioner General of"
"","under Section 136 of the Act, challenging inter alia that the Notice of Assessment had"
"","been issued outside the statutory time limit and was therefore null and void. Several"
"","further objections were taken by the Appellant,
including that the mandatory statutory"
"","requirement
to
communicate
reasons
for
not
accepting
the
return
had not been"
"","complied with prior to the making of the assessment."
"13.","The appeal was thereafter taken up for hearing before the Department. The Appellant,"
"","in
by its written submissions dated 8th February 2010, marked P8 in the brief, set out"
"","detail the objections to the assessment. The Respondents, by their written submissions"
"","dated 26th February 2010, asserted that
the assessment had in fact been made within"
"","time, contending that the document marked P4 in the brief constituted an assessment"
"","in terms of Section 134, and that the Notice dated 11th June 2008 was only the formal"
"","communication of an assessment already made."
