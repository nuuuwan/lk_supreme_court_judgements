"the Assessor genuinely
applied their mind to the
taxpayer’s
return and reached a"
"definite determination. His Lordship stated:"
"“The primary purpose of
the amending legislation is to ensure that
the Assessor"
"will bring his mind to bear on the return and come to a definite determination"
"whether or not
to accept
it.
It was
intended to prevent arbitrary and grossly"
"unfair assessments which many Assessors had been making as
“a protective"
"measure"". An unfortunate practice had developed where some Assessors, due to"
"pressure of work and other
reasons,
tended to delay looking at a return till
the"
"last moment and then without a proper
scrutiny of
the return, made a grossly"
"exaggerated
assessment. Under
the
amendment when an Assessor
does not"
"accept a return,
it must mean that at
the relevant point of
time he has brought"
"his mind to bear on the return and has come to a decision rejecting the return."
"Consequent
to
this
rejection,
the
reasons must
be
communicated
to
the"
"Assessee… His reasons must be communicated at or about the time he sends his"
"assessment on an estimated income. Any later communication would defeat the"
"remedial action intended by the amendment.”5"
