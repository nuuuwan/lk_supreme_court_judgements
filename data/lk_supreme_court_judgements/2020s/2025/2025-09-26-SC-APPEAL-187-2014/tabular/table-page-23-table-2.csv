"in D.M.S. Fernando and Another v. Mohideen Ismail, where a similar contention was"
"raised by the Deputy Solicitor-General, the Court held that:"
"”There was another matter
that was
raised incidentally.
It was contended by"
"the Deputy Solicitor‑General that the Respondent was not entitled to maintain"
"this application for Writ because an alternative remedy by way of appeal was"
"available to him under
the Inland Revenue Act. Those provisions confine him"
"to an appeal against
the quantum of assessment. The Commissioner has not"
"been given power
to order
the Assessor
to communicate reasons. He may, or"
"may not, do so as an administrative act. The Assessor may, or may not, obey."
"The Assessee is powerless to enforce the execution of such administrative acts."
"The present objection goes to the very root of the matter and is independent of"
"quantum.
It concerns
the very exercise of power and is a fit matter
for Writ"
"jurisdiction. An application for Writ of Certiorari
is the proper remedy.”17"
