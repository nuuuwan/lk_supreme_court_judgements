"58.","It is in this context the teachings of the Arthashastra14, an ancient treatise on statecraft"
"","and economic policy by Kautilya (Chanakya), carry wisdom. Kautilya famously said:"
"","“The King shall
collect
taxes
from his
subjects
just as a bee
collects"
"","honey from a flower, without disturbing its petals.”"
"59.","The act of taxation, then, must reflect the touch of the honeybee—light, measured, and"
"","never
destructive.
Just
as
the
bee
draws
only what
it
needs,
leaving
the
flower"
"","unharmed to bloom again,
so too must
the State collect
revenue in a manner
that"
"","secures
its
due without
crippling
the
people who
provide
it.
Taxation must
be"
"","restrained,
imposed “gently and without
inflicting pain or hardship,” so that both the"
"","government and its citizens may endure and prosper
together. The lesson is timeless,"
"","but perhaps never more important than today."
"60.","In today’s economy,
taxation is not merely a means for
the State to raise revenue;
it"
"","functions
like
the framework of
a bridge
that
supports
commerce
and livelihoods."
"","Businesses,
investors, and individuals build their plans upon it, expecting stability and"
"","predictability. When taxes are imposed arbitrarily, or assessments are issued without"
"","proper notice, the bridge wobbles, plans are disrupted and unnecessary burdens fall on"
"","those who rely on it.
In a modern,
interconnected economy,
the law must ensure that"
"","this
framework remains steady.
I
then repeat, once again,
that
taxation must be fair,"
"","measured,
and applied in a manner
that
allows both the State and its
citizens
to"
"","flourish together."
"61.","I wish to make a further observation with regard to deriving guidance from authorities"
"","of other
jurisdictions. Authorities
such as Honig15 were decided in a bygone era of"
"","14 Kautilya, The Arthasastra (R Shamasastry tr, Government Press 1915) bk 5, ch 2."
"","15 Honig and Others (administrators of Emmanuel Honig) v. Sarsfield (H M Inspector of Taxes) [1985] STC 31"
"","(Ch D), affd [1986] STC 246 (CA)."
