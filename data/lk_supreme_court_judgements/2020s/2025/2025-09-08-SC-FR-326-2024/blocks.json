In addition thereto, we have heard the submissions of learned Deputy Solicitor General representing the 7th Respondent \u2013 The Honourable Attorney General, who has assisted Court by tendering on the direction by Court the corresponding notes of investigations. On a considering of the available material, it is the view of this Court that the Petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court on a prima facie basis that his arrest was contrary to the threshold requirement contained in Section 32(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and that his arrest amounted to an infringement of his Fundamental Rights under Article 13(1) of the Constitution. That is on the footing that, as at the time the Petitioner was arrested, it is clear that the police had sufficient reliable material to objectively infer that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Petitioner had cheated the 4th Respondent and misappropriated the latter\u2019s money. In the circumstances, it is not possible to grant Leave to Proceed in this matter and accordingly the Petition is dismissed. In the course of considering the material placed before this Court, it transpired that the Mullativu Special Crimes Investigations Unit of the Sri Lanka Police had recorded the complaint against the Petitioner and another person, in the Sinhala language, notwithstanding the fact that the said complainant (4th Respondent) and the other such person are persons of Tamil ethnicity and speak the Tamil language. Further, perusal of the Information Book extracts reveals that the Petitioner as well as the other person suspected of having committed the offences jointly with the Petitioner are also Tamil gentlemen, who are not conversant in the Sinhala language. They had also been interviewed by the Police in Sinhala and their statements had also been recorded in the Sinhala language. It also transpired that the first \u2018B Report\u2019 tendered to the Magistrate\u2019s Court of Mullativu bearing No. B/444/2023 had been prepared in the Sinhala language, signed and presented to Court, notwithstanding the fact that the learned Magistrate is a Tamil speaking gentleman, the suspects produced before that Court are Tamil speaking, and the Attorneys-at-Law who represented them are also Tamil speaking. This Court notes that this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs. In the circumstances, the Attorney-General is directed to bring this unsatisfactory state of affairs and the observations of this Court to the attention of the Inspector General of Police and advise him to comply with the relevant provisions of the Constitution (Chapter IV) and with the official languages policy of the Government of Sri Lanka. The IGP is required to ensure that Tamil speaking suspects as well as victims of crime and other witnesses who speak the Tamil language are necessarily interviewed in their vernacular language and their",
