Introduction

This appeal arises from the judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal, Kegalle, dated September 28, 2015, whereby the learned Judges of the

High Court affirmed the order of the learned District Judge delivered on April

23, 2013.

5

The substituted Defendants-Respondents-Appellants-Appellants (hereinafter

referred to as the ‘substituted Defendants-Appellants’) sought leave to appeal

to this Court against the aforesaid judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal.

Upon hearing the submissions of learned Counsel for the substituted

Defendants as well as learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Petitioner-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Plaintiff-Respondent’), this Court

granted leave to appeal on the questions of law set out in paragraph 19(a), (b),

and (c).1

However, upon the conclusion of arguments, this Court decided to answer only

the questions of law set out in paragraph 19(a) and (b) of the Petition. For

clarity, I will now quote the two questions of law, which read as follows:

(a) Has the learned District Judge erred in law allowing the substitution of

the Petitioner under section 341 of the Civil Procedure Code in the absence

of a valid and executable decree?

(b) Can the substituted parties be compelled to purge a default of a deceased

party?

At the stage of argument, both learned Counsel for the substituted Defendants –

Appellants and for the Substituted Plaintiff-Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Plaintiff-Respondents’) were heard, and

judgment was reserved.

Since the questions of law were newly identified, both parties were permitted

to file post-argument written submissions.

Pleadings in the District Court

The Plaintiff instituted action in the District Court of Kegalle by his plaint

dated July 2, 1991, against the original Defendant, seeking, inter alia, a

declaration that he is entitled to use a footpath over the Defendant’s land to

access his residence; Rs. 5,000 as quantified damages; and Rs. 100 per month

as future damages.

Upon service of summons, the Defendant appeared in Court and filed his

answer dated June 3, 1992, seeking, inter alia, the dismissal of the Plaintiff’s

action and a declaration that the Plaintiff is not entitled to a right of way over

his land.

Thereafter, the Plaintiff sought a commission to survey the corpus. Upon

receipt of the plan and report, the Plaintiff filed an amended plaint on July 2,

1996, claiming the right of way depicted in the plan2.

In response, the Defendant filed an amended answer on September 2, 19963.

Thereafter, on May 23, 1997, the Plaintiff again filed an amended plaint4.

In the amended plaint, the Plaintiff claimed the right of way depicted as No. 1

in Plan No. 873, prepared by P. B. Wijesundara, Licensed Surveyor, on the

basis of necessity, and sought, inter alia, a declaration of his entitlement to the

said right of way; the removal of obstructions thereto; Rs. 5,000 as quantified

damages; and Rs. 100 per month as future damages.

In reply, the Defendant filed an amended answer on October 10, 19975. In his

amended answer, the Defendant sought, inter alia, the dismissal of the

Plaintiff’s action and a declaration that the Plaintiff was not entitled to a right

of way over his land.

After the closure of pleadings, the case was fixed for trial. Following the

second date of trial, the Plaintiff filed a draft amended plaint on July 22, 1999,

which the Court accepted as the amended plaint6. Consequently, the Defendant

amended his answer7.

Thereafter, the case was again fixed for trial, and subsequently scheduled for

trial and/or settlement on several occasions.

The ex-parte Trial, Judgment and the Decree

On the sixth date of trial, namely October 25, 2002, the Defendant was absent,

and the Defendant’s registered attorney informed the Court that he had no

instructions from the Defendant. Accordingly, the learned District Judge rightly

fixed the case for ex-parte trial against the Defendant, acting under Section 84

of the Civil Procedure Code.

On November 1, 2002, the case was taken up for ex-parte trial, and the Plaintiff

gave evidence in support of his case. The ex-parte judgment was delivered on

the same day granting the reliefs prayed for by the Plaintiff. Thereafter, the

learned District Judge, acting under Section 85(4) of the Civil Procedure Code,

ordered that a copy of the ex-parte decree be served on the Defendant. Under

Section 86(2), the Defendant had fourteen days from the service of the decree

to apply to the Court to purge his default. Accordingly, an ex-parte decree

entered against a Defendant is not an executable decree until it is served on the

Defendant who was in default.

8

The Plaintiff’s registered attorney had submitted a draft decree on several

occasions, but it was not issued to the Defendant due to various defects.8

Finally, the learned District Judge made the order to ‘take steps and move.’

After a long delay, a decree in order was submitted by the Plaintiff’s registered

attorney and signed by the learned District Judge. At that time, the Plaintiff

informed the Court that the Defendant had passed away after the ex-parte trial.

Thereafter, on January 21, 2012, the Plaintiff’s registered attorney made an

application to execute the ex-parte decree, and the learned District Judge,

notwithstanding that the Defendant was deceased before the decree was served,

ordered it to be issued through the Fiscal. The Fiscal proceeded to execute the

writ and reported to the Court that the Defendant was dead and that a house had

been built across the disputed right of way.

Consequently, the learned District Judge granted a date for the Plaintiff to

consider effecting substitution in place of the deceased Defendant for the

purpose of executing the decree. Accordingly, the Plaintiff moved to substitute

the 1st to 5th Respondents named in the Petition in the room and place of the

deceased Defendant9. Upon service of notice of substitution to the 1st to 5th

legal representatives of the deceased Defendant, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th

Respondents filed their objections. They sought to dismiss the Plaintiff’s

application for substitution and execution of the writ on the following grounds.

(i)The 4th and 5th Respondents are not children of deceased Defendant.

(ii)The Plaintiff has an alternative road.

(iii)The 4th Respondent had built his dwelling house about six years ago,

and the Plaintiff who did not object to the construction made this

application with the intention of demolishing it.

The 3rd Respondent, who appeared in Court and sought to file a proxy and

objections, did not file either the proxy or the objections.

9

Thereafter, the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th Respondents filed their written submissions.

Although the Respondents raised questions regarding the merits of the

Plaintiff’s case in their objections, in an inquiry for substitution, consideration

of such merits clearly falls outside the scope.

The learned District Judge, having considered that the inquiry had been

disposed of on written submissions, delivered the order allowing the

substitution of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Respondents. Accordingly, they were

substituted as 1අ, 1ආ, and 1 ඇsubstituted Defendants10.

The Defendant’s default, ex- parte decree and continuation of Proceedings

against the substituted Legal Representatives.

In the case at hand, the Defendant died on December 16, 2002, after the ex-

parte judgment was entered but before the decree was served on her. The

substituted Defendants-Respondents-Appellants-Appellants (hereinafter

referred to as the ‘substituted Defendants-Appellants’) contended that, since the

Defendant died before the decree was entered, no confirmed decree existed

against her in law.

However, Section 188 of the Civil Procedure Code reads that “as soon as may

be after the judgment is pronounced, a formal decree bearing the same date as

the judgment shall be drawn up by the court….” [Emphasis added]

In addition to that, as per the interpretation section of the Civil Procedure Code,

a decree is ‘the formal expression of an adjudication upon any right claimed

or defence set up in a civil court......’ [Emphasis added]

Accordingly, even if a decree is entered subsequently, it should relate back to

the date of the judgment, and it is the responsibility of the Court to enter the

10 Vide Order dated February 2, 2012 at p. 126 of the District Court record.

10

decree in accordance with its judgment. It is true that, over the years, a practice

has developed whereby parties prepare the decree and submit it to the Court for

the judge’s signature. However, such practices cannot override the statutory

responsibility conferred on the Courts. The Court of Appeal rightly observed in

Pathirana v. Induruwage11 that the entering of a decree is a ministerial act, and

it is the duty of the learned District Judge to enter the decree.

In the case of Perera et al. v. Fernando et al.,12 De Sampayo A.J. observed that,

“the failure of the Court to do a (….) ministerial act (….) in time should not

affect the parties, and when a formal decree is entered and signed, it should be

taken to be operative as from the date of the judgment. [Emphasis added]

As I have already stated above in this judgment, in the instant case there was a

long delay in entering the proper decree. However, as correctly submitted by

the Plaintiff, the sole responsibility for the delay cannot be attributed to the

Plaintiff.

In the instant case, the principal contention of the substituted Defendants

-Appellants was that they were not in a position to purge the default committed

by the diseased original defendant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as ‘the

original defendant’), as the reasons for such default were within the personal

knowledge of the original Defendant. However, it is important to note that in

the objections filed by the 1අ, 1ආ, and 1ඇ substituted Defendants-Appellants,

along with two others, they categorically stated that the original Defendant’s

default at trial was due to her prolonged illness caused by cancer.13 Hence, it is

clear that the reason was well within the knowledge of the substituted

Defendants-Appellants. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the

substituted Defendants-Appellants should not be allowed to approbate and

reprobate, or to blow hot and cold.11 [2002] 2 Sri L.R. 63.12 17 N.L.R. 300.13 Vide at page 93 and 95 of the District Court record.

11

Nevertheless, for the purpose of addressing Question of Law No. 2 sets out

above in this judgment, the broader issue of whether a substituted Defendant

may be compelled to purge the default of a deceased Defendant will be

considered below.

Section 398 of the Civil Procedure Code in force at the time relevant to this

case, provided as follows14;

398 (1) If there be more defendants than one, and any of them die before

entering decree and the right to sue on the cause of action does not survive

against the surviving defendant or defendants alone, and also in case of the

death of a sole defendant, or sole surviving defendant, where the right to

sue survives, the plaintiff may make an application to the court, specifying

the name, description, and place of abode of any person whom he alleges to

be the legal representative of the deceased defendant, and whom he desires

to be made the defendant in his stead. The court shall thereupon, on being

satisfied that there are grounds therefor, enter the name of such

representative on the record in the place of such defendant, and shall issue

a summons to such representative to appear on a day to be therein

mentioned to defend the action, and the case shall thereupon proceed in the

same manner as if such representative had originally been made a

defendant, and had been a party to the former proceedings in the action:

Provided that the person so made defendant may object that he is not the

legal representative of the deceased defendant, or may make any defence

appropriate to his character as such representative.

(2) The legal representative of a deceased defendant may apply to have

himself made a defendant in place of a deceased defendant, and the

provisions of this section, so far as they are applicable, shall apply to the

application and to the proceedings and consequences ensuing thereon.

14 Amendment No 08. of 2017 to the Civil procedure Code repealed Section 398, and a new section was adopted thereby.

12

In the Court of Appeal case of Hameed and Another v. Dharmasiri and

Others15, Wijeyaratne J. held;

“Thus, it is seen that by judicial interpretation the term "legal representative"

in section 394(2) has received an extended meaning. On the death of a

defendant the court should bring in the legal representative on the record

before proceeding with it.

The suit may be described to be in a state of suspension till then and no orders,

excepting formal or processual, can be passed. If the suit is disposed of without

impleading the legal representatives of a deceased party, re-trial will be

ordered (Commentary on the Code of Civil Procedure by Chitaley and Rao, 7th

Edition (1963), Volume III, Page 3372).”

At this stage, it is pertinent to consider the point at which proceedings may be

continued against the legal representatives following the death of the original

Defendant.

The decision in Muheeth v. Nadarajapillai Et Al16 lucidly draws the distinction

between the point at which litis contestatio is reached in an action in rem as

opposed to an action in personam. The Court held:

"An action became litigious, if it was in rem, as soon as the summons

containing the cause of action was served on the defendants; if it was in

personam, on litis contestatio which appears to synchronize. with the joinder

of issue or the close of the pleading"

In Executors of Meyer v. Gericke17, the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good

Hope, which also followed Roman-Dutch law as the common law, dealt with

the important question of the stage at which, in an action for defamation or

15[1990] 1 Sri L.R. 410.16 19 NLR 461 at 462.17 (1880) ZASCCGH 4 (2 February 1880) at page 16,17,18.

13

other personal injury, the death of one of the parties brings the action to an end,

and made the following observation:

"at what stage of the action does the litis contestatio take effect? Broadly

stated, the answer must be that it takes effect as soon as the case is ripe for

hearing, or, if the defendant is in default, as soon as he is debarred by law

from defending the action. Allowing for differences in the system of pleading,

this answer will apply equally to the Roman Law, the Dutch Law, and the law

of this Colony. In regard to the Roman system of civil process it is well known

that the mode of procedure underwent great changes from the early times of

Rome to the time of Justinian. Throughout these changes, however, it was

always considered necessary that the time when a contested right was to be

considered as really made the subject of litigation should be carefully marked.

In the time of Justinian an action was begun with the denunciatio actionis, by

which the plaintiff announced to a magistrate that he wished to bring an

action. and furnished a short statement of his case. This statement might be

oral or in writing, and was sent by the Magistrate, through a bailiff of the

Court, to the defendant. The parties or their procurators appeared before the

Magistrate, and he then and there decided the case. (...) The litis contestatio

took place directly the Magistrate began to hear the cause.

In Holland the mode of procedure was far more cumbrous, and the difficulty of

marking the exact time when the litis contestatio took place was

proportionately greater than under the Roman system. In summary causes

(such as actions for a decree of civil imprisonment, or for a decree of perpetual

silence) there was not much difficulty, for as soon as the defendant had

objected to the plaintiff’s claim, the litis contestatio was held to have taken

effect (....), for the Court might then hear and decide the case without further

pleadings.

Again, a kind of fictitious litis contestatio was, according to Voet, admitted

when a defendant remained in default after three edictal citations had been

issued against him (Comm. 5, 1, 145, and 47, 10, 22), for the effect of his

14

default was that he was thereafter debarred from defending the action, unless

leave was given to him by the opposite party, or by the Court, to purge his

default. In ordinary defended cases, however, the rule was that the litis

contestatio was not complete until after duplicatio was pleaded (...) - Now the

duplicatio or duplique of the Dutch law corresponds with the rejoinder of our

law (...) the-litis- contestatio in an ordinary defended suit may be considered to

take place as soon as the pleadings are closed." [Emphasis Added]

Accordingly, in an action where the Defendant appears before the Court, litis

contestatio occurs when the Defendant pleads. However, in a case where the

Defendant defaults, litis contestatio takes effect at the time of the Defendant’s

default.

Despite the fact that the reasons for the original Defendant’s default were

within the knowledge of the substituted Defendants in this case, the argument

that the reasons for the default lie solely within the personal knowledge of the

Defendant is devoid of merit in law. It is a well-established rule that, even in an

action in personam, an heir is bound by his predecessor in interest once the

action has reached the stage of litis contestatio.

Once an heir is substituted in a case, they cannot alter or modify the position

held by the deceased predecessor. Proceedings before the Court must continue

from the point where the predecessor left them. Procedural rules should not

obstruct justice or legitimize any injustice. In such circumstances, the

Petitioner’s only available course of action is to file an application to set aside

the ex-parte decree, provided there are valid reasons either on their own behalf

or on behalf of their predecessor. Unless, in my view, permitting the legal heirs

of the original Defendant at this stage to ‘set the clock back’ would cause grave

prejudice to the Plaintiff.

Therefore, I am of the view that once legal representatives’ step into the shoes

of a deceased Plaintiff or Defendant, as the case may be, they must adopt the

position occupied by their predecessor.

15

The legal representatives, therefore, must proceed with the litigation from the

stage at which the death of the Defendant or Plaintiff occurred. They are legally

bound by the pleadings or non-pleadings of their predecessors-in-interest in

whose place they have been substituted.

In the instant case, as the original Defendant passed away before having an

opportunity to purge the default, the substituted Defendants-Appellants may

continue the proceedings by purging the default of the said original defendant

as the next step. In the event of their failure to do so, the decree will be made

absolute.

Impugned Orders of the learned District Judge and the learned High

Court Judges

Having effected substitution in place of the original Defendant as aforesaid, the

learned District Judge ordered that the decree be served on the substituted

Defendants-Appellants. Following service of the decree, the substituted

Defendants-Appellants filed a petition supported by an affidavit seeking to set

aside the ex-parte decree.18.

Thereafter, the matter was fixed for inquiry on November 6, 201219.

Before the date fixed for inquiry, on October 11, 2012, the Plaintiff made an

application seeking an interim injunction and a mandatory injunction against

the substituted Defendants-Appellants, restraining them from erecting buildings

that obstruct the right of way claimed by the Plaintiff, and a mandatory

injunction directing them to remove the glass debris placed on the said right of

way20. Accordingly, the learned District Judge issued notice of interim

injunction to the substituted Defendants-Appellants.

20Vide journal entry No. 72 of the District Court record.

16

On November 6, 2012, the case was fixed for inquiry into the application made

by the substituted Defendants-Appellants to purge the default of the original

Defendant and to set aside the ex- parte decree. On the said date, the Court

removed the case from the inquiry roll21. Thereafter, on February 8, 2013, the

substituted Defendants-Appellants filed objections to the Plaintiff’s application

for an interim injunction and a mandatory injunction22. On the same date, the

learned District Judge granted a date for the parties to file written submissions

on the question of whether an inquiry could be held under Section 86 of the

Civil Procedure Code, mandating the substituted Defendants-Appellants to

purge the default of the deceased original Defendant.

Accordingly, the parties filed their written submissions on March 15, 201323.

Thereafter, on April 23, 2013, the learned District Judge delivered her order24

on the issues concerning the interim injunction, the mandatory injunction, and

the question as to whether an inquiry could be held under Section 86 of the

Civil Procedure Code.

It appears that the learned District Judge completely lost sight of the fact that a

prior application to set aside the ex- parte decree was still pending inquiry.

Directions were given for submissions to be made, in accordance with which

the substituted Defendants-Appellants filed their submissions.

The order of the learned District Judge reads as follows:

The learned District Judge, and subsequently the learned Judges of the High

Court of Civil Appeal in affirming the District Judge’s order, held that since the

Defendants, who had initially sought to purge the default, subsequently adopted

a different stance and sought to have the hearing to purge the default dismissed,

the ex- parte decree would automatically become absolute.

However, I am unable to agree with positions taken by learned District Judge

and the learned High Court Judges. Because, as the said relief has been sought

by the Defendants as a consequential relief among others in seeking to get the

order dated February 2, 2012 to substitute the Defendants in place of the

original defendant and to move the Court to exercise its inherent powers under

section 839 to correct alleged defects in the case record as main reliefs. This

was a fact which the District Judge was completely ignorant of when delivered

the order depriving the substituted Defendants-Appellants an opportunity to

purge the default.

It is noteworthy that the substituted Defendants-Appellants have prayed for

setting aside the inquiry under section 86 of the Civil Procedure Code only as a

consequential relief to the aforementioned main reliefs but not as a substantive

relief. This misunderstanding could have been easily avoided if the substituted

Defendants-Appellants were mindful to plead alternatively to continue with the

purge default inquiry in case their main reliefs were not granted.

The learned High Court Judges observed that the learned District Judge has

made the order for the substitution of the Defendant under wrong section,

which was Section 341, when in fact the substitution should have done under

18

section 398 of the Civil Procedure Code. Nonetheless such accidental slip by

the District Judge would not make the order per se devoid of law as long as the

Court has the authority to issue such an order, the reasoning to which I am

inclined to agree.

For the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that learned High Court Judges

were correct in upholding the validity of the substitution of Defendants in place

of the deceased original Defendant, though his subsequent finding to deprive

the Defendants to purge their default under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure

Code is incorrect.

Writ of Execution: Possibility of Issuance After Ten Years from Decree

Although this point was not contested, the question arises as to whether a writ

of execution may be issued, as ten-year time period has elapsed since the

decree.

Simply stated, in terms of Section 337(1), no application to execute a decree

shall be allowed after ten years from the date of the decree, or, if there was an

appeal, after ten years from the date on which the decree was affirmed on

appeal. In cases where the decree or any subsequent order directs the payment

of money in installments or the delivery of property on a specified date, the

ten-year period is calculated from the date of default in making such payment

or delivering such property.

However, as per section 337(2) of the Civil Procedure Code if the judgment-

debtor has by fraud or force prevented the execution of the decree within that

period, the rigidity of this rule is relaxed. In such circumstances, the ten year

period begins to run from the date of removal or cessation of such malady or

disability.

If the aforementioned statutory bar applies to this case, any consequential steps

taken following this judgment would be futile.

In the Supreme Court case of Mohamed Azar v. Idroos,25 Amaratunga J. held:

25 [2008] 1 Sri LR 232 at 241.

“The time bar prescribed by section 337(1) commences to operate only from

the date on which the judgment creditor becomes entitled to execute the writ,

and as such it has no application to a case where the judgment creditor is

prevented by a rule of law from executing the writ entered in his favour. The

time bar will apply in cases where the judgment creditor after becoming

entitled to obtain the writ has slept over his rights for ten years

Under Section 337(3), which was introduced by Act No. 53 of 1980, a writ of

execution remains in force for one year from the date of issuance. It may be

renewed before its expiration for another year from the date of such renewal,

and so on, continuously. If renewal is not sought within the year, fresh writs

may be issued until the decree is satisfied, provided the application is made

within the ten-year period mentioned above. Before the said amendment, once

an application to execute a decree had been allowed under Section 337(1), no

subsequent application could be made unless the Court was satisfied that ‘due

diligence’ had been exercised on the last preceding application to procure

complete satisfaction of the decree. However, this requirement was removed by

the aforesaid amendment. Irrespective of due diligence, the judgment-creditor

may now make successive applications for writs until the decree is satisfied. If

the judgment-creditor did not or could not make an application under Section

325 in case of resistance, obstruction, hindrance, or ouster, they may make an

application under Section 337 within ten years for a fresh writ or re-issuance of

a writ, subject to Section 347.

In the case at hand, the date of the decree should be November 1, 2002. The

first application to serve the decree on the Defendant was made on April 2,

2003, well within the ten-year period, but it was not in order. As stated above in

this judgment, a decree in proper form was submitted by the Plaintiff only on

November 1, 2011, after a long delay. Although the Plaintiff informed the Court

that the Defendant was passed away, the Court inadvertently ordered the decree

to be served on the Defendant. Since it was the duty of the Court to enter the

decree, I am of the view that the ten-year period under Section 337 should

commence from the date the formal decree was entered, which was the date

from which the Plaintiff could take steps to serve the decree on the Defendant.

Conclusion

In light of the reasoning provided above, the Questions of Law raised are

answered in the following manner: -

(1) Has the learned District judge erred in law allowing the substitution of

the Petitioner under Section 341 of the Civil Procedure Code in the

absence of valid and executable decree?

The learned District Judge acted under the wrong section in allowing the

substitution of the Petitioner under Section 341 of the Civil Procedure

Code in the absence of valid and executable decree. Nonetheless, it does

not affect the validity of the order as the Court still has the jurisdiction

to issue such an order under Section 398 (1).

(2) Can the parties be compelled to purge a default of a deceased party?

Yes, the Substituted Defendants-Appellants who have stepped into the

shoes of the deceased original Defendant can be compelled to purge the

default of the deceased party.

The appeal is partly allowed with costs and the case is remitted back to the

High Court of Civil Appellate of Kegalle to be sent back to the District Court

of Kegalle to proceed with the purge default inquiry as per this judgment.
