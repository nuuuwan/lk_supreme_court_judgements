"The learned District Judge, and subsequently the learned Judges of the High"
"Court of Civil Appeal in affirming the District Judge’s order, held that since the"
"Defendants, who had initially sought to purge the default, subsequently adopted"
"a different stance and sought to have the hearing to purge the default dismissed,"
"the ex- parte decree would automatically become absolute."
"However, I am unable to agree with positions taken by learned District Judge"
"and the learned High Court Judges. Because, as the said relief has been sought"

"original defendant and to move the Court to exercise its inherent powers under"
"section 839 to correct alleged defects in the case record as main reliefs. This"
"was a fact which the District Judge was completely ignorant of when delivered"
"the  order   depriving  the  substituted  Defendants-Appellants  an  opportunity  to"

"made   the   order   for   the   substitution   of   the   Defendant   under   wrong   section,"
"which was Section 341, when in fact the substitution should have done under"
