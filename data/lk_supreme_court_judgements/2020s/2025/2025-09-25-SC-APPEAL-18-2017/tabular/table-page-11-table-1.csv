"decree in accordance with its judgment. It is true that, over the years, a practice"
"has developed whereby parties prepare the decree and submit it to the Court for"
"the judge’s signature. However, such practices cannot override the statutory"
"responsibility conferred on the Courts. The Court of Appeal rightly observed in"
"Pathirana v. Induruwage11 that the entering of a decree is a ministerial act, and"
"it is the duty of the learned District Judge to enter the decree."
"In the case of Perera et al. v. Fernando et al.,12 De Sampayo A.J. observed that,"
"“the failure of the Court to do a (….) ministerial act (….) in time should not"
"affect the parties, and when a formal decree is entered and signed, it should be"
"taken to be operative as from the date of the judgment.   [Emphasis added]"
"As I have already stated above in this judgment, in the instant case there was a"
"long delay in entering the proper decree. However, as correctly submitted by"
"the Plaintiff, the sole responsibility for the delay cannot be attributed to the"
"Plaintiff."
"In   the   instant   case,   the   principal   contention   of   the  substituted   Defendants"
"-Appellants was that they were not in a position to purge the default committed"
"by the diseased original defendant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as ‘the"
"original defendant’), as the reasons for such default were within the personal"
"knowledge of the original Defendant. However, it is important to note that in"
"the objections filed by the 1අ, 1ආ, and 1ඇ substituted Defendants-Appellants,"
"along with two others, they categorically stated that the original Defendant’s"
"default at trial was due to her prolonged illness caused by cancer.13 Hence, it is"
"clear   that   the   reason   was   well   within   the   knowledge   of   the   substituted"
"Defendants-Appellants.   In   these   circumstances,   I   am   of   the   view   that   the"
"substituted   Defendants-Appellants   should   not   be   allowed   to   approbate   and"
"reprobate, or to blow hot and cold."
