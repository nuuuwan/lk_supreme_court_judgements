"“The time bar prescribed by section 337(1) commences to operate only from"
"the date on which the judgment creditor becomes entitled to execute the writ,"
"and as such it has no application to a case where the judgment creditor is"
"prevented by a rule of law from executing the writ entered in his favour. The"
"time   bar   will   apply   in   cases   where   the   judgment   creditor   after   becoming"
"entitled to obtain the writ has slept over his rights for ten years"
"Under Section 337(3), which was introduced by Act No. 53 of 1980, a writ of"
"execution remains in force for one year from the date of issuance. It may be"
"renewed before its expiration for another year from the date of such renewal,"
"and so on, continuously. If renewal is not sought within the year, fresh writs"
"may be issued until the decree is satisfied, provided the application is made"
"within the ten-year period mentioned above. Before the said amendment, once"
"an application to execute a decree had been allowed under Section 337(1), no"
"subsequent application could be made unless the Court was satisfied that ‘due"
"diligence’  had   been   exercised   on   the   last   preceding   application   to   procure"
"complete satisfaction of the decree. However, this requirement was removed by"
"the aforesaid amendment. Irrespective of due diligence, the judgment-creditor"
"may now make successive applications for writs until the decree is satisfied. If"
"the judgment-creditor did not or could not make an application under Section"
"325 in case of resistance, obstruction, hindrance, or ouster, they may make an"
"application under Section 337 within ten years for a fresh writ or re-issuance of"
"a writ, subject to Section 347."
"In the case at hand, the date of the decree should be November 1, 2002. The"
"first application to serve the decree on the Defendant was made on April 2,"
"2003, well within the ten-year period, but it was not in order. As stated above in"
"this judgment, a decree in proper form was submitted by the Plaintiff only on"
"November 1, 2011, after a long delay. Although the Plaintiff informed the Court"
"that the Defendant was passed away, the Court inadvertently ordered the decree"
"to be served on the Defendant. Since it was the duty of the Court to enter the"
"decree, I am of the view that the ten-year period under Section 337 should"
"commence from the date the  formal decree  was entered, which was the date"
"from which the Plaintiff could take steps to serve the decree on the Defendant."
