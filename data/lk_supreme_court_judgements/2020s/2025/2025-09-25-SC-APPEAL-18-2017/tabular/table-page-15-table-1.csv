"default was that he was thereafter debarred from defending the action, unless"
"leave was given to him by the opposite party, or by the Court, to purge his"
"default.   In   ordinary   defended   cases,   however,   the   rule   was   that   the   litis"
"contestatio was not complete until after duplicatio was pleaded (...) - Now the"
"duplicatio or duplique of the Dutch law corresponds with the rejoinder of our"
"law (...) the-litis- contestatio in an ordinary defended suit may be considered to"
"take place as soon as the pleadings are closed.""   [Emphasis Added]"
"Accordingly, in an action where the Defendant appears before the Court, litis"
"contestatio  occurs when the Defendant pleads. However, in a case where the"
"Defendant defaults, litis contestatio takes effect at the time of the Defendant’s"
"default."
"Despite   the   fact   that   the   reasons   for   the   original   Defendant’s   default   were"
"within the knowledge of the substituted Defendants in this case, the argument"
"that the reasons for the default lie solely within the personal knowledge of the"
"Defendant is devoid of merit in law. It is a well-established rule that, even in an"
"action in personam, an heir is bound by his predecessor in interest once the"
"action has reached the stage of litis contestatio."
"Once an heir is substituted in a case, they cannot alter or modify the position"
"held by the deceased predecessor. Proceedings before the Court must continue"
"from the point where the predecessor left them. Procedural rules should not"
"obstruct   justice   or   legitimize   any   injustice.   In   such   circumstances,   the"
"Petitioner’s only available course of action is to file an application to set aside"
"the ex-parte decree, provided there are valid reasons either on their own behalf"
"or on behalf of their predecessor. Unless, in my view, permitting the legal heirs"
"of the original Defendant at this stage to ‘set the clock back’ would cause grave"
"prejudice to the Plaintiff."
"Therefore, I am of the view that once legal representatives’ step into the shoes"
"of a deceased Plaintiff or Defendant, as the case may be, they must adopt the"
"position occupied by their predecessor."
