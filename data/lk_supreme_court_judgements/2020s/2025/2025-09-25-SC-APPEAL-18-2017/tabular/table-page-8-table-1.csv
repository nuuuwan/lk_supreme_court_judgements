"Plaintiff’s action and a declaration that the Plaintiff was not entitled to a right"
"of way over his land."
"After   the   closure   of   pleadings,   the   case   was   fixed   for   trial.   Following   the"
"second date of trial, the Plaintiff filed a draft amended plaint on July 22, 1999,"
"which the Court accepted as the amended plaint6. Consequently, the Defendant"
"amended his answer7."
"Thereafter, the case was again fixed for trial, and subsequently scheduled for"
"trial and/or settlement on several occasions."
"The ex-parte Trial, Judgment and the Decree"
"On the sixth date of trial, namely October 25, 2002, the Defendant was absent,"
"and   the   Defendant’s   registered   attorney   informed   the   Court   that   he   had   no"
"instructions from the Defendant. Accordingly, the learned District Judge rightly"
"fixed the case for ex-parte trial against the Defendant, acting under Section 84"
"of the Civil Procedure Code."
"On November 1, 2002, the case was taken up for ex-parte trial, and the Plaintiff"
"gave evidence in support of his case. The ex-parte judgment was delivered on"
"the same day granting the reliefs prayed for by the Plaintiff. Thereafter, the"
"learned District Judge, acting under Section 85(4) of the Civil Procedure Code,"
"ordered that a copy of the ex-parte decree be served on the Defendant. Under"
"Section 86(2), the Defendant had fourteen days from the service of the decree"
"to  apply  to  the  Court  to  purge  his  default.  Accordingly,  an  ex-parte  decree"
"entered against a Defendant is not an executable decree until it is served on the"
"Defendant who was in default."
