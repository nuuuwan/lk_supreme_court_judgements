"The legal representatives, therefore, must proceed with the litigation from the"
"stage at which the death of the Defendant or Plaintiff occurred. They are legally"
"bound by the pleadings or non-pleadings of their predecessors-in-interest in"
"whose place they have been substituted."
"In the instant case, as the original Defendant passed away before having an"
"opportunity to purge the default,  the substituted Defendants-Appellants may"
"continue the proceedings by purging the default of the said original defendant"
"as the next step. In the event of their failure to do so, the decree will be made"
"absolute."
"Impugned Orders of the learned District Judge and the learned High"
"Court Judges"
"Having effected substitution in place of the original Defendant as aforesaid, the"
"learned   District   Judge   ordered   that   the   decree   be   served   on   the   substituted"
"Defendants-Appellants.   Following   service   of   the   decree,   the   substituted"
"Defendants-Appellants filed a petition supported by an affidavit seeking to set"
"aside the ex-parte decree.18."
"Thereafter, the matter was fixed for inquiry on November 6, 201219."
"Before the date fixed for inquiry, on October 11, 2012, the Plaintiff made an"
"application seeking an interim injunction and a mandatory injunction against"
"the substituted Defendants-Appellants, restraining them from erecting buildings"
"that   obstruct   the   right   of   way   claimed   by   the   Plaintiff,   and   a   mandatory"
"injunction directing them to remove the glass debris placed on the said right of"
"way20.   Accordingly,   the   learned   District   Judge   issued   notice   of   interim"
"injunction to the substituted Defendants-Appellants."
