"The   Plaintiff’s   registered   attorney   had   submitted   a   draft   decree   on   several"
"occasions,   but   it   was   not   issued   to   the   Defendant   due   to   various   defects.8"
"Finally, the learned District Judge made the order to ‘take steps and move.’"
"After a long delay, a decree in order was submitted by the Plaintiff’s registered"
"attorney and signed by the learned District Judge. At that time, the Plaintiff"
"informed the Court that the Defendant had passed away after the ex-parte trial."
"Thereafter, on January 21, 2012, the Plaintiff’s registered attorney made an"
"application   to   execute   the  ex-parte  decree,   and   the   learned   District   Judge,"
"notwithstanding that the Defendant was deceased before the decree was served,"
"ordered it to be issued through the Fiscal. The Fiscal proceeded to execute the"
"writ and reported to the Court that the Defendant was dead and that a house had"
"been built across the disputed right of way."
