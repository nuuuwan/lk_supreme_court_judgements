ARGUED & DECIDED ON : 31st October 2025

JUDGMENT

YASANTHA KODAGODA, PC, J.

Learned Counsel for the Respondent draws the attention of this Court to proceedings

dated 16th January 2017, on which day the corresponding Petition had been supported

and this Court had been pleased to grant Leave to Appeal. He submits that there are

two errors in the question of law raised on behalf of the Respondents. They are -

(i) the date of the settlement referred to in the question raised which presently

reads as 12.10.1994, should in fact be corrected as a reference to 12.10.2009, and

(ii) the reference to the date of Plan No.752 referred to in the same question which

presently reads as 31.08.1995, should in fact be corrected as a reference to

13.08.1995.

Therefore, learned counsel for the Respondent moves that the proceedings be

corrected to that effect. Learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that the

proceedings should in fact be corrected as suggested by learned Counsel for the

SC APPEAL 05/2017 – JUDGMENT 4

Respondent. Accordingly, the Registrar is directed to correct the proceedings of 16th

January 2017 in the manner stated above.

Thereafter, this matter was taken up for hearing.

We have heard learned Counsel for the Appellant and the learned Counsel for the

Respondent. Following the conclusion of the hearing, Court indicated to learned

Counsel that the Court will deliver Judgment ex-tempore. Accordingly, delivery of the

Judgment was postponed till the end of today’s Court sessions, and the Court

proceeded to hear other matters on the list.

At 12.40 p.m., this matter was once again taken up for delivery of the Judgment. On

that occasion, learned Counsel, who had during the intervening period received fresh

instructions from the 1st and 2nd Respondents, submitted to Court that he is willing to

concede that the impugned Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeals should be

set aside, if the Appellant tenders through Counsel an apology to the Respondents. In

response, learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted to Court that she is in a

position to tender such apology on behalf of the Appellant to the two Respondents

through their Counsel. Accordingly, such apology was tendered, and learned Counsel

for the Respondents accepted the apology on behalf of his clients.

Court observes that the course of action adopted by learned Counsel before this Court

is most desirable, given the precipitating factors which led to litigation before this

Court. Furthermore, this Court notes the redundancy of terms 1 and 2 of the terms of

settlement entered in the High Court of Civil Appeals dated 12.10.2009, which in the

opinion of the Court did not warrant the activation of clause 4 of the terms of

settlement on the premise that there had been breach by the Appellant.

In the circumstances referred to above, the impugned judgment of the High Court of

Civil Appeals dated 17.09.2015 and the impugned judgment of the District Court

SC APPEAL 05/2017 – JUDGMENT 5

dated 19 01.2010 are both set aside. In other words, the status quo pertaining to the

property in issue as at the date of filing of the District Court action will prevail.

Accordingly, the Appeal is allowed. Proceedings are terminated.
