"Service  (total  number  of  vacancies  in  all  Divisional  Secretariat  Divisions).  The"

"(Secretary,  Ministry of  Public  Administration  and  Home  Affairs)  to  fill  all  such"

"Divisional  Secretariat  Divisions  and 
the  marks  obtained  by 
the  applicants"
"(candidates)  at  the  written  examination,  the  Department  of  Examinations  had"
"released a list of 3,568 names of candidates who were to be called for the structured"
"interviews. This would amount to nearly twice the number of vacancies available"
"at the level of each of the Divisional Secretariat Division. [As to why a list of 3,670"
"candidates  (exactly  twice  the  number)  were  not  released  by  the  Department  of"
"Examinations, is not known.] Accordingly, the Ministry of Public Administration"
"called the entirety of the 3,568 candidates for the structured interviews."
