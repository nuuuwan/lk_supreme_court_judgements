"developments such as the Respondents calling for Applications for recruitment of"
"persons to be appointed to Grade III of the Grama Niladhari Service, it became"
"necessary for the Petitioners to move Court to grant interim relief. The nature of"
"the  interim  relief  sought  was  to  stay  the  processes  of  calling  for  Applications"
"afresh,  conducting  examinations  and  interviews,  and  selecting  persons  to  be"
"appointed to the Grama Niladhari Service. On an application made by the learned"
"Deputy Solicitor General on behalf of the Respondents, time was granted for the"
"filing of limited objections with regard to the afore-stated application for interim"
"relief. However, thereafter, as an alternative step, the date fixed for argument was"
"advanced, and the Court made an order directing parties to maintain the status quo"
"till  the  date  of  hearing.  That  in  effect  was  to  halt  the  fresh  process  of  selecting"
"persons to be appointed to Grade III of the Grama Niladhari Service."
