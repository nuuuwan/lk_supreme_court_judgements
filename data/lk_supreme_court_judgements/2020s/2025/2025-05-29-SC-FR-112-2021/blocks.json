In defence, he drew the attention of this Court to certain Rules of the Public Service Commission published in Gazette No. 1589/30 dated 20th February 2009. Learned DSG relied on Rule 3 in an attempt to justify these deviations from the SOR. In terms of Rule 3, the PSC has conferred on itself the authority to deviate from the Rules, Regulations and Procedure laid down by the Commission, provided that such deviations are made under exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the PSC has in the same Rule acknowledged that such deviations shall be subject to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. In other words, if a deviation were to be inconsistent with Article 12(1), such deviation would not be valid, even if carried out under exceptional circumtances. As held by this Court in the case of N.C. Gajaweera and Others v. Prof. Siri Hettige and Others [SC/FR Application No. 14/2017, SC Minutes 20.03.2024], \u201c\u2026 deviation from the Procedural Rules is permissible in terms of Rule 3 which provides that, \u201cSubject to Article 12(1) of the Constitution the Commission reserves to itself the right to deviate from rules, regulations and procedure laid down by the Commission under exceptional circumstances.\u201d [Emphasis added by me.] \u201c\u2026 Although a deviation from the Rules is permissible, it is duly recognised that such deviation cannot be violative of Article 12(1). Furthermore, deviation must not only be the exception but should only be done in exceptional circumstances. The reasons for such deviation demonstrating the existence of reasonable grounds for such deviation and the reasons for such deviation shall accordingly be recorded.\u201d Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere in that judgment has further held that \u201cthe stated intention of the Public Service Commission in formulating the Procedural Rules \u2026 is to create a level playing field thus affording an equal opportunity to those who are eligible for any appointment or promotion, as the case maybe, and to ensure the selection of the most suitable person through a transparent recruitment/promotion process \u2026 in reality,",

Inspector General of Police and Others [(2019) 1 SLR 100] this Court has held that \u201cthe law, as it presently stands, is that an assurance given ultra vires by a public authority, cannot found a claim of a legitimate expectation based on that assurance. But, it has to be recognised that there may be many instances where a petitioner who relies on an assurance given by a public authority or one of its officials, reasonably believed that the public authority or official who gave it to him was acting lawfully and within their powers. It is also often the case that an individual who deals with a public authority will find it difficult to ascertain the extent of its powers and those of its officials. In such cases, much hardship will be done to an individual who bona fide relies on an assurance given to him by a public authority or one of its officials and is later told the assurance he relied on and acted upon, sometime with much effort and at great cost to him, cannot be given effect to because of a flaw regarding its vires. In such instances, the principle of legality comes into conflict with the principle of certainty and, the law as it stands now, is that the illegality of the assurance will defeat the value of certainty which contends that the assurance should be given effect.\u201d Therefore, as the events associated with the 3rd round of recruitment (which commenced without a Notice calling for Applications and the conduct of a written examination corresponding to that round of recruitment) were contrary to the \u2018applicable or governing law\u2019 and thereby resulted in an assurance that is ultra vires, the conduct of the Respondents could not have given rise to a legitimate expectation for the Petitioners. Thus, even if an \u2018expectation\u2019 was generated in the minds of the Petitioners, such expectation in the view of this Court does not amount to a \u2018legitimate expectation\u2019 founded upon one or more lawful representations made by one or more Respondents or by the State as a whole. Furthermore, the present instance cannot be regarded as a situation where the Petitioners had reasonably believed that the Public Service Commission was acting lawfully well within their powers, as the Petitioners were soundly aware of the recruitment procedure contained in the Scheme of Recruitment. Therefore, the basis for the Petitioners\u2019 claim that their fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution fails.",
