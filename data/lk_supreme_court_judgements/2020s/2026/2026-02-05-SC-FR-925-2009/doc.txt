Respondents on 17th September 2025

ARGUED ON: 28th August 2025

DECIDED ON: 05th January 2026

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. This Fundamental Rights application was preferred by Public Officers belonging to Class

II of the Sri Lanka Technical Education Service (hereinafter referred to as “Petitioners”)

seeking, inter alia, a declaration that their fundamental right guaranteed under Article

12(1) of the Constitution has been violated due to the action of one or more of the

Respondents.

2. At the commencement of the arguments on 28th August 2025, all parties agreed that the

determination in SC FR 925/2009 would be applicable to the connected matter SC FR

926/2009, given the similarity of the legal and factual issues.

3. Instant applications relate to the appointments of the 3rd to 11th Respondents as

Directors of the Colleges of Technology and the appointments of the 12th to 20th

Respondents as Additional Directors of the Colleges of Technology. The Petitioners assert

that these appointments were made without following the proper procedure and in

disregard of the applicable eligibility criteria. Petitioners are also contending the

subsequent promotions granted to these Respondents to Class I of the Sri Lanka Technical

SC FR 925/2009 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 20

Education Service (SLTES), claiming that such advancements were similarly irregular and

unjustified.

4. The Deputy Solicitor General also raised four preliminary objections concerning the

maintainability of these applications, asserting that they should be dismissed in limine

without a consideration of the merits. They are as follows:

i. The application of the Petitioner was filed out of time hence it is time-

barred;

ii. The Petitioners have suppressed vital material facts and have made

misrepresentations of facts;

iii. The Petitioners have no locus standi to maintain this application; and

iv. Necessary parties are not before the court.

OBJECTION ON TIME BAR

5. I shall, at the outset, consider the objection founded on the time bar, as the application

must be dismissed in limine for want of jurisdiction, if the same is upheld.

6. Article 126(2) of the Constitution stipulates that an application alleging the infringement

of a fundamental right must be instituted within one month from the date of the alleged

violation. The mandatory nature of this one-month rule has been emphasised time and

time again by this Court.1 Unless there are the most exceptional of circumstances in which

SC FR 925/2009 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 20

the principle lex cogit ad impossibilia is applicable,2 this Court does not have jurisdiction

to entertain an application that is filed out of time.3

7. The Petition relates to a sequence of administrative actions between 2007 and 2009.

Initially, the 2nd Respondent issued Circulars on 22nd January 2007 [Marked “P6”], and

6th February 2007 [Marked “P7”], suspending all promotions to Class I until the Service

Minute could be formally amended to incorporate the new cadre for the Colleges of

Technology. Despite this suspension, an advertisement was published on 12th June 2008,

in the Daily News [Marked “P8”], calling for applications for the posts of Director and

Additional Director of the Colleges of Technology. This initial process did not lead to

appointments because the Department of Management Services had not yet formally

approved the cadre.

8. On 16 July 2008, the 1st, 2nd, and 5th Petitioners appeared for interviews; however, no

SC FR 925/2009 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 20

appointments were made at that stage as the relevant cadre positions had not yet

received approval and the applicable Service Minute remained unamended. Shortly

thereafter, on 18th July 2008, the Department of Management Services granted approval

for the creation of a new cadre, although this approval was not gazetted for more than a

year.

9. In the interim, on 20th February 2009, new Procedural Rules of the Public Service

Commission were published. Subsequently, on 6th March 2009, a notice inviting

applications for Class III positions was issued, prescribing 31st March 2009 as the closing

date for applications and as the cut-off date for required qualifications. Despite this, a

Gazette Notification dated 10th July 2009 [Marked “P11”] called for promotions from Class

II to Class I and imposed a markedly earlier eligibility cut-off date of 1st January 2006.

10. Thereafter, on 11th September 2009 and 18th September 2009, two differing marking

schemes governing the promotional process were issued, one by way of circular and the

other by Gazette and interviews were conducted in late September 2009 for 165 officers,

during which the 1st and 2nd Petitioners were informed that they were ineligible on the

basis that they had not satisfied the 2006 cut-off requirement.

11. It was only on 16th October 2009 that a Gazette notification formally established 18 new

cadre positions, cleaning to give such creation retrospective effect from July 2008.

Following this, on 29th October 2009, letters of appointment were issued to the 3rd to

20th Respondents, who thereafter assumed duties as Directors and Additional Directors

on 3 November 2009. The present petition was filed on the 2nd December 2009.

12. The Petitioners state that they are not challenging the application process where the

applications were invited for promotions to Class I of SLTES by the Gazette Notification

dated 10th July 2009 [Marked “P11”]. Their contention is instead based on the fact that

the vacancies in question were not in existence at the time of calling applications.

SC FR 925/2009 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 20

13. The Petitioners state that, as specified by the Government Gazette dated 10th July 2009

[Marked “P11”], candidates must have completed five years of service in Class II as at 1st

January 2006. They contend that if eligibility is restricted to officers who had the required

five years of service by that date, then only vacancies that existed on or before 1st January

2006 could lawfully have been filled based on such criteria. However, if a vacancy arose

later, the Petitioners contend that eligibility should then reasonably extend to officers who

had completed five years of service by that later date.

14. The Petitioners state that although they did not meet the eligibility criteria by the 1st

January 2006, by the date on which Advertisement P11 was issued, namely, 16th October

2009, all the Petitioners had acquired and satisfied the full set of qualifications prescribed

for eligibility for promotion from Class II to Class I, and were therefore duly qualified to

be considered for such promotion.

15. The Respondents contend that applications for promotion to Class I of the Sri Lanka

Technological Education Service (SLTES) were duly called by Gazette Notification [marked

“1R1” (identical to “P11”)] dated 10th July 2009, expressly stating that the eligibility as at

01st January 2006 is to be considered. However, the present Petition was instituted only

on 02nd December 2009, over three years and eleven months later. The Respondents

further submit that the Petitioners have wholly failed to establish that their case falls within

the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia so as to justify the delay in invoking the jurisdiction

of this Court.

16. The Petitioners state that they only became aware of the said appointments after the 3rd

to 20th Respondents had assumed duties on 03rd November 2009 in the positions of

Director and Additional Director. The letters of appointment were personally addressed

to the appointees and were not accessible to the Petitioners. They claim to have only

SC FR 925/2009 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 20

become aware of the appointments through subsequent letters and circulars issued after

the Respondents assumed duties, which are produced as P17–P24.

17. Although the Petitioners claim to have had no knowledge of the appointments on this

basis, from the arguments made before us, it is clear that the grievances of the Petitioners’

related to the condition that required qualifications need to have been satisfied by 01st

January 2006. Clearly, the infringement alleged by the Petitioners is immediately referable

to this particular condition in the scheme of promotions.

18. As Kulatunga, J. held in Gunaratne v. Sri Lanka Telecom [1993],4

“…if a scheme, such as the one before us, affecting promotions in an existing service

is inherently discriminatory, the right to relief accrues immediately upon the

adoption of such scheme and prospective candidates for promotion under such

scheme may apply for a declaration that such scheme is invalid on the ground that

it constitutes an infringement or an imminent infringement of their rights under

Article 12 (1).”

19. Similarly, Fernando, J. reasoned in Dayaratne v. National Savings Bank [2002]5 as

follows:

“The first limb of the Respondents’ preliminary objection is that after the lapse of one

month the Petitioners were not entitled to challenge the scheme of promotion. The

1st Respondent was entitled, from time to time, and in the interests of the institution,

to lay down the basis on which employees would be promoted, and that became part

of the contract of employment. The scheme of promotion published on 12. 02. 2001

was directly and immediately applicable to the petitioners, and became part of the

4 [1993] 1 Sri LR 109, at p. 115

5 [2000] 3 Sri LR 116, at p. 124

SC FR 925/2009 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 20

terms and conditions of their employment. If they did not consent to those terms and

conditions, as being violative of their rights under Article 12, they should have

complained to this Court within one month.”

20. It is of significance that, in the instant case, the criteria for promotions were announced

via Government Gazette dated 10th July 2009 [Marked “P11”], and the said Gazette

contained this condition. If the Petitioners thought the aforementioned condition to be

arbitrary and violative of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, they ought to have challenged

the same one month after the publication of the said Gazette, which they have failed to

do. If the said Gazette did not amount to sufficient notice, the Petitioners should have

explained why. That, too, has not been done.

21. As Prasanna Jayawardena, PC, J. held in Demuni Sriyani De Soyza and Others v.

Dharmasena Dissanayake and Others [2016],6

“It should be added here that, if the facts and circumstances of an application make

it clear that, a Petitioner, by the standards of a reasonable man, should have become

aware of the alleged infringement by a particular date, the time limit of one month

will commence from that date on which he should have become aware of the alleged

infringement…”

22. His Lordship, emphasising that objective criteria must be applied in determining when a

petitioner became aware of an alleged infringement, further referred to the case of

Illangaratne v. Kandy Municipal Council [1995],7 where Kulatunga, J. held,

“...it would not suffice for the petitioner to merely assert that he personally had no

knowledge of the discriminatory act, if on an objective assessment of the evidence he

6 S.C F.R. 206/2008, SC Minutes of 09 December 2016, at pp. 10-11

7 BALJ Vol. VI Part 1, at p. 11

SC FR 925/2009 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 20

ought to have had such knowledge.”

23. The necessity to apply objective criteria in this regard has been subsequently emphasised

by this Court in numerous judgments.8 Accordingly, in the face of a clear and public

disclosure of the promotions criteria by Government Gazette dated 10th July 2009

[Marked “P11”], I am unable to accept the Petitioners' contention that they had no prior

knowledge of the alleged violation.

24. The Petitioners also state that the 5th Petitioner lodged Complaint No. HRC/3094/09

before the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, alleging that the restriction contained

in P11, which confined eligibility to apply for promotion to Class I constituted a violation

of his fundamental rights.

25. It was contended that, in addition to the time limitation stipulated under Article 126(2) of

the Constitution, Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 21

of 1996 provides a distinct statutory avenue for the redress of human rights grievances.

This provision enables an aggrieved person to initially seek relief by lodging a complaint

before the Human Rights Commission in respect of an alleged infringement of

fundamental rights. Learned Counsel for the Petitioners argued that the filing of such a

complaint serves to preserve the Petitioner’s right to subsequently invoke the jurisdiction

of this Court, notwithstanding the expiration of the one-month period prescribed under

Article 126(2).9

8 Dola Mullage Gunarathna and Another v. K. W. E. Karalliyadda and Others, SC FR 18/2020, SC Minutes of 7 September 2022, at pp. 14-15; K.H.G. Kithsiri v. Hon. Faizer Musthapha and Others, SC FR Application No. 362/2017, SC Minutes of 10 January 2018, at p. 9

9 Some earlier authorities may be read in such a manner to support this contention: See, Amura Deshapriya Alles and Another v. Road Passenger Services Authority of the Western Province and Others, S.C.F.R. 448/2009, SC Minutes of 22 February 2013; Romesh Coorey v Jayalath [2008] 2 Sri LR 43

SC FR 925/2009 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 20

26. Conversely, the learned Deputy Solicitor General emphasized the strict and mandatory

nature of the constitutional time bar. They contended that this limitation is binding in all

circumstances and that the mere lodging of a complaint before the Human Rights

Commission does not suspend, nullify, or extend the constitutionally prescribed period.

27. In order to ensure the applicability of Section 13(1), it becomes necessary to examine, as

a matter of preliminary consideration, whether the act of lodging a complaint before the

Human Rights Commission has the effect of suspending or extending the constitutional

time limit within which a fundamental rights application may be filed before this Court.

28. It is now settled law that Section 13 of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No.

21 of 1996 should not be interpreted in a manner to suspend the one-month rule

stipulated in the Constitution10 and that the mere filing of a complaint before the

Commission is not sufficient to obtain the benefit of the said provision.11

29. Having referred to a long line of authorities, Janak De Silva, J., in Thilangani Kandambi

v. State Timber Corporation and Others [2022],12 synthesised the development of the

law in this regard as follows:

(a) “The initial view was that mere production of a complaint made to the Human Rights

Commission of Sri Lanka within one month of the alleged infringement is sufficient

to get the benefit of the provisions in section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission

of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 [Romesh Coorey v Jayalath (2008) 2 Sri.L.R. 43, Alles

v. Road Passenger Services Authority of the Western Province, (S.C.F.R. 448/2009,

S.C.M. 22.02.2013)].

(b) However, the correct position is that a petitioner must show evidence that the Human

Rights Commission of Sri Lanka has conducted an inquiry regarding the complaint

or that an inquiry is pending. Simply lodging a complaint is inadequate. [Subasinghe

(c) A party cannot benefit from the provisions in section 13(1) of the Human Rights

Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 where the complaint to the Human

Rights Commission is made one month after the alleged violation [Alagaratnam

Manoranjan v. G.A. Chandrasiri, Governor, Northern Province, (S.C.F.R. 261/2013,

S.C.M. 11.09.2014)]

(d) The provisions of section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No.

21 of 1996 is not available to a petitioner who has made a complaint to the Human

Rights Commission only to obtain an advantage by bringing his application within

Article 126(2) of the Constitution [K.H.G. Kithsiri v Faizer Musthapha, (S.C.F.R.

362/2017, SCM 10.01.2018)]”

30. The now well-established position that a party who fails to adduce sufficient evidence to

satisfy the Court that a complaint before the Human Rights Commission was made within

one month, pursuant to which a genuine inquiry was pending, cannot benefit from

Section 13(1) of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act has been reaffirmed in

several subsequent judgments of this Court.13 Only where such an inquiry is shown to

have been genuinely ongoing can the period consumed thereby be excluded for the

purpose of computing the applicable time limit.

31. The Petitioner has not produced any evidence to demonstrate that any inquiry is pending

before the Human Rights Commission regarding the alleged complaint. Rather, the

complaint has been lodged solely as a way to evade the mandatory time bar. Such a tactic

cannot, and should not, be permitted as a means of “buying time” to regularize an

otherwise time-barred Petition.

32. Upon examining the instant case, I find only an unsubstantiated assertion in paragraph

25 of the petition and the corresponding paragraph of the affidavit, that a complaint had

been lodged with the Human Rights Commission (HRC/3094/09). No documentary proof

or corroborative material has been produced to substantiate this claim or to show when

exactly this complaint was made.

33. In the instant matter, the Petitioner has neither furnished evidence to establish that any

inquiry was pending before the Human Rights Commission, nor provided a satisfactory

explanation for the prolonged delay in filing the Petition.

CONCLUSION

34. As morefully explained above, the Petitioners have failed to file this application within a

constitutionally stipulated time period. Accordingly, I uphold the preliminary objection

raised by the Respondents.

35. As the application is time barred, this court does not have the jurisdiction to hear and

determine this matter, and the Petition is accordingly dismissed.

Application Dismissed.
