ARGUED ON : 04-11-2025

DECIDED ON : 12-02-2026

P. PADMAN SURASENA, CJ

The Petitioners are Head Quarters Sports Officers of the Department of Sports

Development. The Public Service Commission (PSC) by Notice published in the Gazette

dated 17-11-2017 called for applications from suitable persons to fill 3 posts of

Assistant Director (Sports) of Supervisory Category III in the Department of Sports

Development. Clause 4 of the said Gazette has set out the necessary qualifications

and experience in the following manner:

“04. Educational, Professional qualifications and experience :

(I) Should be a Supra Grade officer in the sports officers’ service of the

Department of Sports Development

or

(II) Should be a Supervisory Management Assistant Technological Grade I

officer of Sports Officers’ Combined service of the Department of Sports

Development

or

(III) Should be a Supervisory Management Assistant Technological Grade II of

Sports officers’ combined service of the Department of Sports Development,

and should possess s Degree related to Sports or Management field, obtained

from a university recognized by the University Grant Commission

or

(IV) Should be an officer of Sports Officers’ Combined Service in the

Department of Sports Development, with 10 years active and satisfactory

period of service and should have obtained a Degree related to the field of

Sports from a university recognized by the University Grants Commission.”

The Petitioner has produced this Gazette marked P15(a).

[SC/FR.NO.267/2018] – Page 9 of 13

Clause 8 of the said Gazette [P14(a)] has described the relevant marking scheme

applicable to the evaluation of the above qualifications. It is as follows:

Main Heads for

Marking

Marks

01

Additional Service

Experience

I. 05 marks for each year from the date of

appointment to the post of Supervisory

Management Assistant in the sports

officers’ combined service (Head

Quarters Sports Officer)

or

II. 04 marks for each year from the date of

appointment to the post of Supervisory

Management Assistant Technology

Service Category Grade II in the sports

officers’ combined service.

or

III. 02 marks for each year from the date

of completion of 10 years in the post

of sports officers’ combined service at

Department of Sports Development.

or

IV. 02 marks for each year from the date

of completion of 10 years in the post

of sports officers’ combined service at

Department of Sports Development.

30

The Petitioners have complained that the above marking scheme is not clear as to

whether their past service they have had in the posts junior to their current post (Head

Quarters Sports Officer) must be taken into account and allotted marks on the basis

that they have possessed additional service experience.

[SC/FR.NO.267/2018] – Page 10 of 13

As pointed out by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, I have no doubt that four limbs

I, II, III, IV under Clause 4 must be referrable directly to each sub limbs I, II, III, IV

under additional service experience (Clause 8). In other words, this can be inserted

into one table which should appear as follows:

No

Educational, Professional

Qualifications and Experience

Additional Service Experience

1

Should be a Supra Grade officer in the

sports officers’ service of the

Department of Sports Development

05 marks for each year from the date

of appointment to the post of

Supervisory Management Assistant in

the sports officers’ combined service

(Head Quarters Sports Officer)

2

Should be a Supervisory Management

Assistant Technological Grade I officer

of Sports Officers’ Combined service of

the Department of Sports

Development

04 marks for each year from the date

of appointment to the post of

Supervisory Management Assistant

Technology Service Category Grade

II in the sports officers’ combined

service.

3

Should be a Supervisory Management

Assistant Technological Grade II of

Sports officers’ combined service of the

Department of Sports Development,

and should possess s Degree related to

Sports or Management field, obtained

from a university recognized by the

University Grant Commission

02 marks for each year from the date

of completion of 10 years in the post

of sports officers’ combined service at

Department of Sports Development.

[SC/FR.NO.267/2018] – Page 11 of 13

4

Should be an officer of Sports Officers’

Combined Service in the Department

of Sports Development, with 10 years

active and satisfactory period of

service and should have obtained a

Degree related to the field of Sports

from a university recognized by the

University Grants Commission.

02 marks for each year from the date

of completion of 10 years in the post

of sports officers’ combined service at

Department of Sports Development.

As all the Petitioners were Head Quarters Sports Officer, they had applied under the

First Category in Clause 4. Therefore, the marks they are entitled to is 5 marks for

each year from the date of appointment to that post (Head Quarters Sports Officer).

The Petitioners have joined the Department of Sports Development as sports officers

on 06-01-1986. Thereafter they were promoted to the post of sports coach with effect

from 01-09-1999. Then they were promoted to the post of Project Officer with effect

from 06-07-2015. The new service minute of the combined service of officers in the

field of sport of the Department of Sports Development which was published in the

Government Gazette (Extra Ordinary) dated 26-09-2016, the Petitioners who were in

the post of project officer were absorbed to the post of Head Quarters Sports Officer

with effect from 26-09-2016. This was the Petitioner’s past career development. Thus,

what the Petitioners insist in the instant case is that they should be awarded marks

for each year they spent in their previous posts.

I regret my inability to accept this argument. The Scheme of Recruitment has been

designed to enable candidates from all four categories to apply. If Petitioners’

argument is to be accepted, the candidates from the other three categories will not

be able to compete with the Petitioners. This is because the Petitioners will score more

as invariably they have passed all those three junior posts in their career. It will then

be impossible for the PSC to select the best from the candidates.

Prior to becoming Head Quarters Sports Officer the Petitioners have held three posts

below the post of Head Quarters Sports Officer. The experience the Petitioners could

have gained in each post would have been relevant for the promotion to their next

[SC/FR.NO.267/2018] – Page 12 of 13

level in the past. The primary qualification under Clause 4 is for a candidate applying

under Category 4(I) is to be a Supra Grade officer in the Sports Officer’s Service of

the Department of Sports Development. Thus, they are entitled to 5 marks for each

year from their date of appointment for the post of Supervisory Management Assistant

in the sports officers combined service (Head Quarters Sports Office). Therefore,

marks allotted under II, III, and IV, are marks which are respectively allotted only to

candidates applying from Categories II, III, IV under Clause 4.

Under Clause 8, 20 marks have been allotted for special skills performed in the post

of Coach and Sports Officer (Head Quarters) which is as follows.

Main Heads for Marking Marks

03

Special skills performed in

the post of coach and

Sports Officer (Head

Quarters)

I. As a Coach or Administrator or

Organizer or holding other post

1. National Level Post – 10 marks

2. South Asian Level Post – 10 marks

3. For Commonwealth and World

Championship – 05 marks

II. 02 marks each for Certificates of

commendation obtained by 230B

Common Format (maximum 10 marks)

20

The Petitioners in the instant case have complained that the order of marks under

special skills performed in the posts of coach and Head Quarters Sports Officer is

irrational and unreasonable as lesser marks are allotted for Commonwealth and World

Championships (5 marks) while more marks have been allotted for National Level (10

marks). The Petitioners have suggested the following order of awarding marks to meet

the reasonable allocation of marks:

i. Olympic/World Championship/Paralympics/Para World Championship

ii. Commonwealth Games

iii. Asian Games/Para Asian Games

iv. South Asian Games

[SC/FR.NO.267/2018] – Page 13 of 13

v. National Level/National Para Games1

Having regard to the Scheme of Recruitment [P14(a)], I observe that both arguments

advanced by the Petitioners are directly attacking the Marking Scheme. However, the

PSC has published the Marking Scheme by the Gazette dated 17-11-2017 itself. This

is the same Gazette which calls for applications for the post of Assistant Director

(Sports). Petitioners have filed this case on 28-08-2018. Thus, Petitioners have directly

impugned this Marking Scheme P14(a) in this Petition. Petitioners admittedly have

participated in this process of selection but failed. It was in that backdrop that the

learned Deputy Solicitor General raised a preliminary objection against the

maintainability of this case by the Petitioners on the basis of time bar. As Article 126(2)

of the Constitution demands that any Petitioner must file the Petition within one month

of their violation of any Fundamental Right. However, the Petitioners have failed to

comply with this requirement. Thus, the Preliminary Objection raised by the learned

Deputy Solicitor General has to be upheld. I have described above, the merits of this

Petition. Therefore, nevertheless I must say that even on merits the Petitioners are

not entitled to succeed with their Petitions.

For the above reasons I decide to dismiss this Petition without costs.

CHIEF JUSTICE

A. L. SHIRAN GOONERATNE, J.

I agree.

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.
