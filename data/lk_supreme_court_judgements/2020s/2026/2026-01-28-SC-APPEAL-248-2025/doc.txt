SC/APPEAL/248/2025

Samayawardhena, J.

The Ministry of Health called for tenders for the supply, installation,

commissioning, and maintenance of one unit of an Extracorporeal Shock

Wave Lithotripsy System for the treatment of ureteral and kidney stones at

the National Hospital of Kandy. The petitioner-respondent (the respondent)

and the 20th respondent-appellant (the appellant) submitted bids in

response to the said tender.

Upon the completion of the prescribed tender procedure, including the

evaluation of bids by the Technical Evaluation Committee and the Ministry

Procurement Committee, the tender was awarded to the appellant. The

respondent’s bid was rejected, inter alia, on the basis that it was priced

higher than that of the appellant and that it deviated from the mandatory

technical specifications.

The appeal preferred by the respondent to the Board of Appeal was also

rejected. The respondent did not challenge that decision before court.

Instead, the respondent invoked the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal,

challenging the decision to award the tender to the appellant.

In terms of the Bidding Data Sheet, a bidder was required, inter alia, to

possess a valid National Medicines Regulatory Authority registration

certificate (NMRA certificate) for the offered model of the device at the time

of submission of the bid.

The respondent challenged before the Court of Appeal the decision to award

the tender to the appellant solely on the basis that, at the time of bid

closure, the appellant did not possess a valid NMRA certificate for the

quoted model, namely “Modulith SLK inline.” In support of this contention,

the respondent produced and marked P9, a copy of the appellant’s NMRA

certificate, in which the term “Modulith” appears under “Brand name” and

10

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

“SLK” appears under “Model,” but the expression “SLK inline” does not

appear as a single description.

Against the description of the device, the NMRA certificate states:

“Lithotripter system with standard accessories and spare parts (Attachment

32 Pages)”. It is not the case of the respondent that it was wholly unaware

of the said 32-page attachment to the certificate. On the contrary, the

respondent was aware of the attachment and had even discussed its

contents with the Chief Executive Officer of the National Medicines

Regulatory Authority, as is evident from the affidavits dated 28.02.2025

filed by a director and another employee of the respondent.

The respondent acknowledges that the 32-page attachment constitutes an

integral and inseparable part of the NMRA certificate and that the device is

described in several places therein as “Modulith SLK inline.” Nevertheless,

the respondent contends that the attachment relates only to spare parts

and not to the machine itself, seemingly on the basis that the description of

the device states, “Lithotripter system with standard accessories and spare

parts (Attachment 32 Pages)”.

This contention is without foundation. The phrase “Attachment 32 Pages”

does not refer solely to “spare parts”.

In any event, once the respondent accepts that the 32-page attachment

forms an integral and inseparable part of the NMRA certificate, it was

incumbent upon the respondent to place that attachment before court

together with the certificate, if it wished the court to determine whether the

attachment related only to spare parts or extended to the machine itself.

The respondent failed to do so. Nor did the respondent make any specific

reference in the petition to the existence or contents of the said attachment.

Instead, the respondent produced only the bare certificate, devoid of the

attachment, along with the petition.

11

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

In my view, this omission amounts to a suppression of a material fact. The

respondent was fully aware of the contents of the attachment and of its

relevance to the issue placed before the Court of Appeal. The failure to

produce the attachment was therefore deliberate. Had it been produced, it

would have demonstrated that the NMRA registration covered the offered

model of the device, thereby undermining the very foundation of the

respondent’s challenge. I take the view that the suppression was calculated

to secure an interim order restraining the commissioning of the system at

the National Hospital of Kandy.

The question as to whether the NMRA certificate tendered by the appellant

relates to the same model as that offered by the appellant in its bid is a

matter that falls squarely within the domain of technical expertise. The most

competent and appropriate authority to answer that question is the

National Medicines Regulatory Authority itself. Neither the court nor

counsel possess the specialised technical expertise required to make such

a determination independently. Significantly, the respondent did not make

the National Medicines Regulatory Authority a party to the writ application.

This omission cannot be overlooked. This conduct falls short of the standard

of uberrima fide expected of a litigant invoking the extraordinary and

discretionary jurisdiction of the writ court.

The limits of judicial review in matters involving specialised technical

expertise have been consistently recognised.

In Tata Cellular v. Union of India 1996 AIR 11 at 28, the Supreme Court of

India observed:

In Chief Justice Neely’s words, “I have very few illusions about my own

limitations as a Judge and from those limitations I generalize to the

inherent limitations of all appellate courts reviewing rate cases. It must

be remembered that this Court sees approximately 1,262 cases a year

12

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

with five Judges. I am not an accountant, electrical engineer, financier,

banker, stock broker, or systems management analyst. It is the height

of folly to expect Judges intelligently to review a 5,000 page record

addressing the intricacies of public utility operation.” It is not the

function of a Judge to act as a super board, or with the zeal of a

pedantic schoolmaster substituting its judgment for that of the

administrator.

The result is a theory of review that limits the extent to which the

discretion of the expert may be scrutinized by the non-expert Judge.

The alternative is for the court to overrule the agency on technical

matters where all the advantages of expertise lie with the agencies. If

a court were to review fully the decision of a body such as State Board

of Medical Examiners, “it would find itself wandering amid the maze of

therapeutics or boggling at the mysteries of the Pharmacopoeia”. Such

a situation as a State Court expressed it many years ago, “is not a case

of the blind leading the blind but of one who has always been deaf and

blind insisting that he can see and hear better than one who has

always had his eyesight and hearing and has always used them to

the utmost advantage in ascertaining the truth in regard to the matter

in question.”

In Uflex Ltd. v. Government of Tamil Nadu and Others [2021] 7 SCR 571,

which involved a challenge to a tender process on the basis of alleged unfair

conditions, the Supreme Court of India reaffirmed the limited scope of

judicial review in technical and contractual matters. At pages 579–580, the

court stated:

The judicial review of such contractual matters has its own limitations.

It is in this context of judicial review of administrative actions that this

Court has opined that it is intended to prevent arbitrariness,

irrationality, unreasonableness, bias and mala fide. The purpose is to

13

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

check whether the choice of decision is made lawfully and not to check

whether the choice of decision is sound. In evaluating tenders and

awarding contracts, the parties are to be governed by principles of

commercial prudence. To that extent, principles of equity and natural

justice have to stay at a distance.

We cannot lose sight of the fact that a tenderer or contractor with a

grievance can always seek damages in a civil court and thus,

“attempts by unsuccessful tenderers with imaginary grievances,

wounded pride and business rivalry, to make mountains out of

molehills of some technical/procedural violation or some prejudice to

self, and persuade courts to interfere by exercising power of judicial

review, should be resisted” (Jagdish Mandal v. State of Orissa, (2007)

14 SCC 517).

Similarly, in Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union (Regd.), Sindri and Others

v. Union of India and Others (1981) 1 SCC 568 at 584, the Supreme Court

of India cautioned:

We certainly agree that judicial interference with the administration

cannot be meticulous in our Montesquien system of separation of

powers. The Court cannot usurp or abdicate, and the parameters of

judicial review must be clearly defined and never exceeded. If the

Directorate of a Government company has acted fairly, even if it has

faltered in its wisdom, the Court cannot, as a super-auditor, take the

Board of Directors to task. This function is limited to testing whether

the administrative action has been fair and free from the taint of

unreasonableness and has substantially complied with the norms of

procedure set for it by rules of public administration.

This court has also acknowledged the need for judicial restraint when called

upon to review decisions that are highly technical in nature. In Sierra

14

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

Construction Ltd. v. Road Development Authority and Others

(SC/FR/135/2023, SC Minutes of 10.02.2025 at pages 10–11), this court

held:

The petitioner did not file any report expressing expert opinion to the

contrary. Neither the Court nor the petitioner possesses the requisite

expertise, resources and capacity to challenge through a fundamental

rights application the accuracy of the findings in the several reports

filed by the Technical Evaluation Committee, the Ministry Procurement

Committee, and the Expert Committee appointed by the Court. Based

on the facts and circumstances of the case, the findings in those reports

are not perverse and are prima facie acceptable to the Court. In such

cases, in exercising its writ or fundamental rights jurisdiction, this

Court must exercise caution in revisiting decisions that are highly

technical in nature. This restraint is necessitated by the Court’s

institutional limitations.

The same principle is reflected in De Smith’s Judicial Review, 8th Edition, at

page 206, which notes that while no public power is inherently immune

from judicial review, courts are constrained both by their constitutional role

and institutional capacity. One such institutional limitation is the lack of

relative expertise, particularly in matters best resolved by specialist bodies

possessing technical knowledge.

Against this background, learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the

respondent members of the Technical Evaluation Committee and the

Ministry Procurement Committee tendered a letter dated 10.02.2025 issued

by the Chief Executive Officer of the National Medicines Regulatory

Authority, confirming that the model “Modulith SLK inline” is included in the

attachment to the certificate of registration and is covered by the said

certificate.

15

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

It must be emphasised that this was not a matter newly discovered in the

course of these proceedings. Both the Technical Evaluation Committee and

the Ministry Procurement Committee had arrived at the same conclusion

during the process of bid evaluation, prior to the decision to award the

tender to the appellant.

All these matters were before the Court of Appeal. The application was

presented as an urgent matter, on the basis that patients were suffering

and awaiting treatment. According to the journal entries of the Court of

Appeal, the case was called in open court on nine occasions. Limited

objections together with documents had been filed, and learned counsel for

the respondent and the appellant, as well as learned Senior State Counsel,

had made extensive oral submissions on several dates. This was

notwithstanding the fact that the matter was being taken up only for the

limited purpose of supporting the application for formal notices and interim

relief on the basis of urgency, and not for final determination. Ultimately,

the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal reserved order and proceeded to

make the following order, which is impugned before us.

The Court heard the oral submissions of the learned Counsel for both

parties and pursue (sic) the documents tendered to Court. Having

heard the oral submission of the learned Counsel and pursuing (sic)

the documents, Court decides that this is a fit case to issue formal

notices on the Respondents. Therefore, upon tendering issue formal

notices on the Respondents. Furthermore, it decides to grant the interim

reliefs sought in the prayer (f) to the Petition.

By granting prayer (f) of the petition, the Court of Appeal suspended all

decisions taken to award the tender to the appellant until the final

determination of the application.

16

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

Being dissatisfied with this order, the appellant invoked the jurisdiction of

this court by way of a leave to appeal application. The application was

vigorously supported by the State.

A previous Bench of this court granted leave to appeal against the said order

on the following questions of law.

(a) Did the Court of Appeal err in law in failing to give reasons for issuing

both the formal notice and the interim stay order?

(b) If this court were to dispose of the matter on the basis of submissions

as on a final appeal, should a writ of certiorari be issued to quash the

award of the tender?

The discussion thus far sufficiently addresses both questions. Nevertheless,

I consider it appropriate to add the following observations as well.

Where extensive written objections have been tendered and submissions

made over several dates on the questions whether formal notice should be

issued and interim relief granted, the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal

is duty bound to give reasons, albeit not with the detail expected of a final

judgment, for rejecting the arguments advanced by the 20th respondent and

the Ministry of Health, including the objections based on the suppression

of material facts and the failure to name necessary parties. The Court of

Appeal is not the final court, and where an order made at that stage is

challenged before this court, this court must know the basis upon which

the learned Judge arrived at the impugned decision.

The duty to give reasons is inherent in the administration of justice and is

an essential incident of the rule of law. The absence of an express statutory

requirement affords no justification for dispensing with reasons. Justice is

not done unless it is apparent to the parties why one has succeeded and

the other has failed. The articulation of reasons promotes transparency,

17

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

enhances public confidence in judicial decision-making, and guards against

arbitrariness.

An aggrieved party is entitled, as of right, to know the reasons for the

decision, at least for the purpose of considering whether to pursue appellate

remedies. The giving of reasons is therefore not a matter of grace or

concession, but a fundamental obligation inherent in the exercise of judicial

power.

I have already adverted to the manner in which the respondent acted

without uberrima fides and suppressed material facts. It is settled law that

lack of uberrima fides, suppression or misrepresentation of material facts,

and the overall conduct of the petitioner are matters of relevance when the

writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is invoked, as writ is a discretionary

remedy. It is settled law that any suppression or misrepresentation of

material facts by a petitioner entitles the court to dismiss the application in

limine, without going into the merits.

Not every suppression or misrepresentation of fact is fatal. The fact

suppressed or misrepresented must be a material fact. The test of

materiality is whether disclosure of the fact could have influenced the

decision of the court. It is not necessary to establish conclusively that the

decision would certainly have been different had the suppressed fact been

disclosed. It suffices to demonstrate that its disclosure had the potential to

affect the court’s determination.

This principle is deeply rooted in equity and has long been recognised across

jurisdictions.

In R. Vishwanatha Pillai v. State of Kerala and Others 2004 (2) SCC 105, the

Supreme Court of India stated:

18

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

A person who seeks equity must come with clean hands. He, who

comes to the Court with false claims, cannot plead equity nor the Court

would be justified to exercise equity jurisdiction in his favour. A person

who seeks equity must act in a fair and equitable manner.

In Ramjas Foundation v. Union of India (2010) 14 SCC 38, the court

emphasised that this rule applies universally across judicial forums and is

not confined to writ proceedings alone. Courts are duty-bound to protect

themselves from litigants who seek to pollute the stream of justice by the

suppression or misstatement of facts bearing on adjudication.

The rationale underlying this principle was authoritatively explained in The

King v. The General Commissioners for the Purposes of the Income Tax Acts

for the District of Kensington; Ex parte Princess Edmond de Polignac [1917]

1 KB 486. Viscount Reading C.J. held that where an applicant fails to

candidly and fairly disclose material facts and thereby misleads the court,

the court ought, for its own protection and to prevent abuse of its process,

to refuse to proceed further with the merits. The Court of Appeal affirmed

this approach, emphasising that in ex parte applications uberrima fides is

indispensable, and any deception practised on the court disentitles the

applicant to be heard. Lord Cozens-Hardy M.R. further stated at page 505:

That is merely one and perhaps rather a weighty authority in favour of

the general proposition which I think has been established, that on an

ex-parte application uberrima fides is required, and unless that can be

established, if there is anything like deception practised on the Court,

the Court ought not to go into the merits of the case, but simply say “We

will not listen to your application because of what you have done.”

As stated by Scrutton L.J., the obligation is to disclose facts, not law, and

the penalty for the breach of that obligation is that the court will set aside

19

SC/APPEAL/248/2025

any advantage obtained through imperfect disclosure, irrespective of

whether the applicant might otherwise have succeeded on the merits.

In K.D. Sharma v. Steel Authorities of India Ltd [2008] 10 SCR 454, 472, the

Supreme Court of India stated that suppression of material facts not only

warrants dismissal of the application in limine but also attracts dealing with

the defaulting party for contempt of court.

Our own courts have consistently applied this principle. In Walker Sons &

Co Ltd v. Wijayasena [1997] 1 Sri LR 293, it was held that once suppression

or misrepresentation is established, a party cannot later plead inadvertence

or ignorance of the importance of the omitted facts.

In Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi (1973) 77 NLR 131 and Moosajees

Ltd. v. Eksath Engineru Saha Samanya Kamkaru Samithiya (1976) 79 NLR

285, this court affirmed that full and truthful disclosure of all material facts

is a condition precedent to the grant of prerogative relief.

In Namunukula Plantations Limited v. Minister of Lands and Others [2012] 1

Sri LR 365, this court reiterated that a litigant invoking discretionary

jurisdiction owes a duty of utmost good faith to the court, and that failure

to discharge that duty obliges the court to deny relief. The court further

emphasised that where a party attempts to pollute the stream of justice, the

court not only has the right, but the duty, to refuse relief.

In Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd. v. Wilfred Van Els and Two Others [1997] 1

Sri LR 360, Mowbray Hotels Ltd. v. D.M. Jayaratne [2004] BLR 51, Fernando

v. Commissioner General of Labour [2009] BLR 74, Sarath Hulangamuwa v.

Commissioner of Examinations and Others (SC/FR/502/2010, SC Minutes

of 05.03.2019) and Fonseka v. Lt. General Jagath Jayasuriya and Five

Others [2011] 2 Sri LR 372 similar conclusions were reached.

On the merits of the instant case, the appellant is entitled to succeed. The

tender procedure has been duly followed and the contention of the

respondent that the appellant did not have a valid NMRA certificate at the

time of the closure of the tender is devoid of merit.

In any event, and even without consideration of the merits, the application

filed by the respondent before the Court of Appeal ought to have been

dismissed in limine on account of the lack of uberrima fides and the

suppression of material facts.

I therefore answer both questions of law on which leave to appeal was

granted in the negative.

The Court of Appeal could not, in law, have quashed by way of certiorari the

decision to award the tender to the appellant. Accordingly, the writ

application filed before the Court of Appeal stands dismissed.

Having regard to the manner in which the writ jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal was invoked, the suppression of material facts, and the serious

consequences that ensued from the interim orders obtained, I am of the

view that this is a fit case for the imposition of punitive costs. Accordingly,

I order that the petitioner-respondent shall pay a sum of Rs. 1,000,000 (one

million) to the 20th respondent and a further sum of Rs. 100,000 (one

hundred thousand) as State costs, within one month from the date of this

judgment.
