Introduction

The Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station, Kopay, instituted these

proceedings in the Primary Court of Jaffna on 11.09.2002 under section

66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979. Sixteen

persons were named as the first party, claiming to be members of the

Board of Management of the Maha Ganapathy Pillayar Kali Kovil at

Kondavil West, while another person was named as the second party,

claiming to be the priest of the said Kovil. It was alleged that persistent

disputes had arisen between the two parties in relation to the affairs of

the Kovil and that such disputes were likely to result in a serious breach

of the peace. Accordingly, an order was sought under section 66 of the

Primary Courts’ Procedure Act to prevent an apprehended breach of the

peace arising from such disputes.

3

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

A number of complaints made to the police, together with statements

recorded in relation thereto from the parties to the case and certain other

persons, were tendered to the court along with the aforesaid first

information.

In terms of section 66(3) read with the proviso to section 66(4) of the Act,

the parties filed affidavits dated 08.01.2003 setting out their respective

claims in relation to the dispute.

In his affidavit dated 08.01.2003, the second party, Sri Skantharaja

Kurukkal, stated that the land on which the Kovil stands belonged to his

ancestors. According to him, the Kovil originated as a small shrine and

was subsequently expanded into a larger Kovil by his grandfather, who

functioned as its trustee, manager, and priest. Upon the demise of his

grandfather, his son continued in those capacities. Thereafter, upon the

demise of the said son, the grandfather’s brother, who was also the father

of the second party, succeeded to those responsibilities. The second party

stated that he himself assumed those responsibilities in 1963.

The Kovil had suffered damage during the civil war. The second party

further stated that he left for Singapore in 1983, having entrusted the

administration of the Kovil and the performance of religious rituals to his

nephew, and that upon his return in 1989 he resumed the

administration and possession of the Kovil, exercising full control over

its religious activities and properties. The second party tendered

documents in support of his position.

According to the second party, on 05.09.2002, the first person of the first

party, Ramalingam Nadarajah, arrived at the Kovil in a three-wheeler

accompanied by four others, forcibly broke open the padlocks, and

dispossessed him of the Kovil.

He prayed that he be restored to possession and that an order be issued

restraining the first party from interfering with his possession until they

obtain appropriate relief from the District Court.

4

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

The first party filed two affidavits dated 08.01.2003. It is evident that

both parties filed their affidavits on the same date. The first person of the

first party, Ramalingam Nadarajah, claimed to be the Chairman of the

Board of Management of the Kovil. The second party does not accept

such a Board of Management. The first party admitted that the second

party, Sri Skantharaja Kurukkal, had functioned as the priest of the

Kovil since 1998, but stated that he had been appointed to that position

by the Board of Management. It was further stated that the Kovil is a

public temple registered with the Department of Hindu Religious and

Cultural Affairs and that the second party had admitted this fact in

writing. The first party tendered documents in support of their position.

The first party alleged that the second party attempted to treat the Kovil

as his personal property and had arbitrarily closed the Kovil for four days

commencing from 01.09.2002. As the Board could not tolerate such

conduct, they admitted that they broke open the Kovil and commenced

the performance of religious rituals through another priest.

The first party prayed that the application be dismissed on the ground

that the Primary Court lacked jurisdiction, as the Fourth Schedule to the

Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978, excluded disputes of this nature from its

jurisdiction.

Although section 66(5) of the Act permits the filing of counter-affidavits,

the record does not disclose that either party sought time to file counter-

affidavits in response to the affidavits of the opposing party. After both

parties filed their affidavits dated 08.01.2003, the case was fixed for

written submissions.

In proceedings under section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, as

the inquiry is generally disposed of by way of written submissions, it is

preferable for the court to grant a date for the filing of counter-affidavits.

Although section 66(5) provides for the grant of such a date only upon

an application made by the parties filing affidavits, affording an

5

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

opportunity to file counter-affidavits would assist the Judge in arriving

at a correct and informed decision.

Upon the filing of written submissions by both parties, the learned Judge

of the Primary Court, by order dated 02.04.2003, found that the second

party had been in actual possession of the Kovil and that the first party

had forcibly dispossessed him within two months prior to the institution

of proceedings by the police. The court accordingly ordered the

restoration of possession of the Kovil to the second party and directed

the first party to seek a final determination of their rights before a

competent court.

Being dissatisfied with the aforesaid order of the Primary Court, the first

party invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Jaffna,

primarily on the ground that the Primary Court lacked jurisdiction to

hear and determine the dispute. Although the learned High Court Judge

correctly held that the Primary Court had jurisdiction to entertain the

matter, he thereafter proceeded to undertake an extensive examination

of the merits of the dispute and ultimately accepted the version advanced

by the first party.

Although the High Court Judge went into the merits of the competing

claims of the parties, it may be recalled that both parties filed their

affidavits on the same date and that no counter-affidavits were tendered

by either party. No oral evidence was led. Neither party accepted the

position of the other, save in relation to the fact of physical possession of

the Kovil by the second party and his forcible dispossession. The second

party did not accept that he had been appointed as the chief priest by

the first party. His position was that he was the hereditary priest and

that the Kovil belonged to his ancestors.

On the basis of the documents tendered by the first party together with

their affidavits before the Primary Court, the learned High Court Judge,

by judgment dated 14.10.2003, concluded that the second party, who

had been forcibly dispossessed, had been appointed as the priest by the

6

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

village community and that the Kovil in question is a public temple

administered by a Board of Management. The court declined to accept

the documents tendered by the second party in support of his claim to

ownership of the Kovil and his status as its trustee and hereditary priest.

The learned High Court Judge further held that a priest occupies the

position of an employee under the Board of Management and, as such,

cannot claim possession of the Kovil in his own right, drawing an analogy

to a bank manager who, though in custody of the keys, cannot claim

ownership or possession of the bank. Accordingly, the order of the

Primary Court was set aside, and possession of the Kovil was directed to

be restored to the first party. It was further observed that the reliefs

sought by the second party could only be granted by the District Court.

Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the second party preferred

an appeal to the Court of Appeal. By judgment dated 08.08.2018, the

Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the High Court mainly on the

ground that the High Court had erred in law in its assessment of the

nature of possession required under section 68 of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act.

The present appeal by the first party is against the judgment of the Court

of Appeal. A previous Bench of this Court has granted leave to appeal

against the said judgment on the following questions of law, as

formulated by the first party.

(1). Has the Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the second

party was in possession of the temple totally disregarding;

(a) that the administration and management of the temple is carried

out by Paripalana Sabai (Board of Management) and are and

have been in possession of the temple since 1993;

(b) letter dated 23.08.2001, in which the second party admitted that

he was appointed by the Paripalana Sabai (Board of

Management) to perform pujas;

7

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

(c) that the priest who was appointed to perform poojas has no right

to claim possession of the temple;

(d) that though a key was kept in the custody of the second party,

the actual and constructive possession of the temple continued

to be with the first party, the Paripalana Sabai?

(2) Is the second party, who is a priest, only entitled to pooja rights and

not the right to possession of the temple and/or the administration and

management of the temple?

Jurisdiction of the Primary Court

The principal contention advanced by the first party before both the

Primary Court and the High Court was that the Primary Court lacked

jurisdiction to entertain the matter by reason of section 32(2) read with

item 11 of the Fourth Schedule to the Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978. The

Fourth Schedule enumerates the actions excluded from the jurisdiction

of the Primary Courts. Item 11 thereof reads as follows: “Any action

relating to a trust, including an action to make good out of the general

estate of a deceased trustee the loss occasioned by a breach of trust, and

any action by a co-trustee to enforce against the estate of a deceased

trustee a claim for contribution.”

This contention is not entitled to succeed. The exclusion in section 32(2)

read with item 11 of the Fourth Schedule to the Judicature Act applies

only to actions in which the court is required to adjudicate substantive

rights relating to a trust, including questions of trusteeship or breach of

trust. Proceedings under section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act

are preventive and summary in nature, confined to determining actual

possession for the purpose of averting a breach of the peace, without

adjudicating upon the substantive rights of the parties. The incidental

involvement of a Kovil or the assertion of rival claims to trusteeship does

not oust the jurisdiction of the Primary Court, which remains competent

to make a preventive order, leaving the parties to seek a final

determination of their rights before a competent court.

8

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

In terms of section 66(1) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, for the

Primary Court to assume jurisdiction under Part VII of the Act, there

must exist (a) a dispute affecting land, and (b) a situation where, owing

to such dispute, a breach of the peace is threatened or is likely to occur.

The expression “likely” does not connote that the apprehended breach of

the peace must be imminent or immediately impending. It signifies no

more than the existence of a probability or a reasonable likelihood of

such a breach of the peace. Therefore, to invoke the jurisdiction of the

Primary Court under section 66(1) of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act,

it is not necessary to wait until the dispute escalates into physical

violence or a grave breach of the peace.

The expression “dispute affecting land” has been accorded a wide

meaning and is not strictly confined to disputes relating to land alone.

Section 75 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act defines the said

expression to include disputes relating to the possession of land or

buildings thereon, boundaries, cultivation, crops or produce, and rights

in the nature of servitudes. The use of the word “includes” makes it clear

that the definition is not exhaustive, but illustrative, and that the

expression is intended to be interpreted broadly. Section 75 provides as

follows:

In this part “dispute affecting land” includes any dispute as to the

right to the possession of any land or part of a land and the

buildings thereon or the boundaries thereof or as to the right to

cultivate any land or part of a land, or as to the right to the crops or

produce of any land, or part of a land, or as to any right in the nature

of a servitude affecting the land.

Formation of opinion regarding breach of the peace

The next question is whether the Judge of the Primary Court must also

be independently satisfied that the dispute is likely to result in a breach

9

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

of the peace in order to clothe himself with jurisdiction under section 66.

As Judges fall into error on this point, let me clarify the legal position.

Under the Administration of Justice Law, No. 44 of 1973, sections 62 to

65 introduced a special procedure enabling the Magistrate’s Court to deal

with disputes affecting land where a breach of the peace was threatened

or likely. Those provisions were repealed by the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, and were replaced by sections 66 to 76 of

the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, No. 44 of 1979. There is a material

difference between the scheme of the Administration of Justice Law and

that of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act in relation to the manner in

which jurisdiction is conferred in respect of such matters.

Section 62(1) of the Administration of Justice Law provided as follows:

Whenever a Magistrate, on information furnished by any police

officer or otherwise, has reason to believe that the existence of a

dispute affecting any land situated within his jurisdiction is likely to

cause a breach of the peace, he may issue a notice (a) fixing a date

for the holding of an inquiry into the dispute; and (b) requiring every

person concerned in the dispute to attend at such inquiry and to

furnish to the court, on or before the date so fixed, a written

statement setting out his claim in respect of actual possession of the

land or the part in dispute and in respect of any right which is the

subject of the dispute.

It is noteworthy that section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law

conferred jurisdiction on the Magistrate only upon the formation of an

opinion that the dispute relating to land was likely to cause a breach of

the peace. The Magistrate was required to have “reason to believe” that

such a likelihood existed before assuming jurisdiction to proceed with

the inquiry. Jurisdiction was therefore not automatic upon the mere

filing of the first information.

10

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

This requirement applied irrespective of whether the information was

filed by a police officer or “otherwise”. The expression “otherwise” was

wide enough to include information filed by a party to the dispute.

Section 145(1) of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973,

corresponds to section 62 of the Administrative Justice Law. Section

145(1) of the Indian Code reads as follows:

Whenever an Executive Magistrate is satisfied from a report of a

police officer or upon other information that a dispute likely to cause

a breach of the peace exists concerning any land or water or the

boundaries thereof, within his local jurisdiction, he shall make an

order in writing, stating the grounds of his being so satisfied, and

requiring the parties concerned in such dispute to attend his Court

in person or by pleader, on a specified date and time, and to put in

written statements of their respective claims as respects the fact of

actual possession of the subject of dispute.

Even under section 145 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure, an

essential precondition for the assumption of jurisdiction by the

Magistrate is that he must be “satisfied”, on the basis of a police report

or other information, that a dispute likely to cause a breach of the peace

exists. It has been held that failure to record such satisfaction renders

the proceedings void in terms of section 461 of the Indian Code of

Criminal Procedure.

Kanagasabai v. Mylwaganam (1976) 78 NLR 280 is regarded as the

leading local authority on the interpretation of section 62 of the

Administration of Justice Law. In that case, Sharvananda J. (as he then

was), explained at pages 286 and 287 the circumstances in which

jurisdiction may be invoked under section 62 of the said Law, stating as

follows:

It is essential for the assumption of jurisdiction under section 62 that

the Magistrate should have reason to believe from a Police report or

11

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

other information that a dispute relating to land, which is likely to

cause a breach of the peace, exists. The report or other information

should contain sufficient material to enable the Magistrate to form

the belief that the dispute is likely to cause a breach of the peace.

The jurisdiction conferred on a Magistrate to institute an inquiry

under this section can be exercised only when the dispute is such

that it is likely to cause a breach of the peace. It is the apprehension

of a breach of the peace, and not any infringement of private rights

or dispossession of any of the parties, which determines the

jurisdiction of the Magistrate. It is sufficient for a Magistrate to

exercise the powers under this section if he is satisfied on the

material on record that there is a present fear that there will be a

breach of the peace stemming from the dispute unless proceedings

are taken under the section. Power is conferred by section 62 in

subjective terms―the Magistrate, being the competent authority, is

entitled to act when he has reason to believe that the existence of a

dispute affecting land is likely to cause a breach of the peace. The

condition precedent to the exercise of the power is the formation of

such opinion―the factual basis of the opinion being the information

furnished by any Police officer or otherwise. A Magistrate is not

bound to take action on a Police report or upon an expression of

opinion by the Police. But, before he takes action, he should have a

statement of facts before him so that he may exercise his own

judgment in arriving at a conclusion as to the necessity of taking

action under this section. The question whether, upon the material

placed before him, proceedings should be instituted under this

section is one entirely within the Magistrate’s discretion. He may

form his opinion on any information received. In my view, he can

base his action on a complaint filed by any of the parties, or on a

Police report. The Magistrate should however proceed with great

caution where there is no Police report and the only material before

him are statements of interested persons.

12

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

It is important to note that the principles articulated by Sharvananda J.

in Kanagasabai v. Mylwaganam with regard to the invocation of

jurisdiction under section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law are

inapplicable to proceedings under section 66 of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act, having regard to the material differences in the statutory

scheme governing the assumption of jurisdiction.

Under section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law, substantial

judicial time was often consumed in preliminary jurisdictional inquiries,

as the Magistrate was required, in the first instance, to determine

whether a breach of the peace was imminent before issuing process.

Such determinations frequently became the subject of review before

appellate courts, consuming the judicial time of the appellate courts as

well. In addition, parties were often reluctant to invoke section 62 in

circumstances where police officers, for various reasons, failed or

declined to report the relevant facts to court.

These practical difficulties were sought to be remedied by the legislature

through the enactment of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, a home-

grown legislative response designed to streamline the procedure and

minimise jurisdictional objections.

Section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, which replaced section

62 of the Administration of Justice Law, provides as follows:

66(1) Whenever owing to a dispute affecting land a breach of the

peace is threatened or likely-

(a) the police officer inquiring into the dispute-

(i) shall with the least possible delay file an information

regarding the dispute in the Primary Court within whose

jurisdiction the land is situate and require each of the parties

to the dispute to enter into a bond for his appearance before

the Primary Court on the day immediately succeeding the

13

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

date of filing the information on which sittings of such court

are held; or

(ii) shall, if necessary in the interests of preserving the peace,

arrest the parties to the dispute and produce them forthwith

before the Primary Court within whose jurisdiction the land is

situate to be dealt with according to law and shall also at the

same time file in that court the information regarding the

dispute; or

(b) any party to such dispute may file an information by affidavit in

such Primary Court setting out the facts and the relief sought and

specifying as respondents the names and addresses of the other

parties to the dispute and then such court shall by its usual

process or by registered post notice the parties named to appear

in court on the day specified in the notice―such day being not

later than two weeks from the day on which the information was

filed.

Section 66(1) thus makes it abundantly clear that the first information

may be filed either by the police officer inquiring into the dispute under

paragraph (a) or by any party to the dispute under paragraph (b).

Section 66(2) then expressly provides that, once an information is filed

under section 66(1), irrespective of whether it is filed by the police or by

a party to the dispute, the Primary Court is automatically vested with

jurisdiction to inquire into and determine the matter. Section 66(2) reads

as follows:

Where an information is filed in a Primary Court under subsection

(1), the Primary Court shall have and is hereby vested with

jurisdiction to inquire into, and make a determination or order on, in

the manner provided for in this Part, the dispute regarding which

the information is filed.

14

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

Accordingly, under the scheme of section 66, the formation of an opinion

as to whether a breach of the peace is threatened or is likely is entrusted

either to the police officer inquiring into the dispute or to any party to

the dispute. Both stand on an equal footing. Unlike the position under

section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law, the Judge of the Primary

Court is not required, at the threshold, to form an independent opinion

as to the imminence or likelihood of a breach of the peace as a condition

precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction.

However, in Velupillai v. Sivanathan [1993] 1 Sri LR 123, Ismail J., sitting

in the Court of Appeal, stated that where the information is filed by a

party to the dispute, as opposed to being filed by the police, the

Magistrate should exercise a higher degree of caution before proceeding

with the matter. This reasoning was explained at page 126 in the

following terms:

In Kanagasabai v. Mylvaganam (1976) 78 NLR 280, 283,

Sharvananda, J. observed “Section 62 of the Administration of

Justice Law confers special jurisdiction on a Magistrate to make

orders to prevent a dispute affecting land escalating and causing a

breach of the peace…The section requires that the Magistrate should

be satisfied, before initiating the proceedings, that a dispute

affecting land exists and that such a dispute is likely to cause a

breach of the peace”.

Under section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the

formation of the opinion as to whether a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely is left to the police officer inquiring into the

dispute. The police officer is empowered to file the information if

there is a dispute affecting land and a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely. The Magistrate is not put on inquiry as to

whether a breach of the peace is threatened or likely. In terms of

section 66(2) the Court is vested with jurisdiction to inquire into and

15

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

make a determination on the dispute regarding which information is

filed either under section 66(1)(a) or 66(1)(b).

However when an information is filed under section 66(1)(b) the only

material that the Magistrate would have before him is the affidavit

information of an interested person and in such a situation without

the benefit of further assistance from a police report, the Magistrate

should proceed cautiously and ascertain for himself whether there

is a dispute affecting land and whether a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely.

This approach articulated by Ismail J. in Velupillai v. Sivanathan was

reiterated by Ismail J. in Punchi Nona v. Padumasena [1994] 2 Sri LR 117

and has been followed in subsequent decisions. However, these

observations proceed on the premise that the jurisdictional scheme

under section 62 of the Administration of Justice Law continues to

govern proceedings under section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure

Act. That premise is erroneous. As explained previously, sections 62 of

the Administration of Justice Law and 66 of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act are materially different, and the latter represents a

deliberate legislative departure from the former.

Accordingly, I hold that the view expressed by Ismail J. in Velupillai v.

Sivanathan [1993] 1 Sri LR 123, to the effect that the Magistrate shall

independently ascertain the existence of a threatened or likely breach of

the peace before assuming jurisdiction when the information is filed by

a party to the dispute, does not represent the correct position of law

under the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act. To that extent, the decision in

Velupillai v. Sivanathan is hereby overruled.

State land

It is also sometimes contended that proceedings under section 66 of the

Primary Courts’ Procedure Act can be invoked only where the dispute

relates to private land and not to State land. This contention is

16

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

unacceptable. Where the dispute is one affecting land, as defined in

section 75 of the Act, and such dispute gives rise to a threatened or likely

breach of the peace, the Primary Court is clothed with jurisdiction to

make an order under Part VII of the Act, irrespective of whether the land

in question is State land or private land. The jurisdiction so exercised is

solely for the purpose of preventing a breach of the peace and not for the

determination of title or proprietary rights.

However, it must be made clear that the State is not bound by an order

made under Part VII of the Act, nor should State officials, in their official

capacity, be made parties to such proceedings. Where the dispute relates

to State land held under a permit or grant issued under the Land

Development Ordinance, any order made by the Primary Court will

operate only until the Divisional Secretary or any other competent

authority makes an order in terms of that Ordinance or any other law

regulating State land.

Paddy land

Another argument advanced is that where the dispute relates to paddy

land, the Primary Court lacks jurisdiction, and such dispute must be

resolved under the mechanism provided in the Agrarian Development

Act, No. 46 of 2000. This argument is primarily founded on the judgment

of the Court of Appeal delivered by S.N. Silva J. (as he then was) in

Mansoor v. OIC, Avissawella [1991] 2 Sri LR 75. That decision is based

on the well-established general principle articulated in Wilkinson v.

Barking Corporation (1948) 1 KB 721 at 724, that “where a statute creates

a right and, in plain language, gives a specific remedy or appoints a

specific tribunal for its enforcement, a party seeking to enforce the right

must resort to that remedy or that tribunal, and not to others.”

The Agrarian Development Act is an undoubtedly a special Act passed,

as the long title of the Act suggests, to “provide for matters relating to

landlords and tenant cultivators of paddy lands”, and therefore,

according to the aforementioned general principle, the jurisdiction of the

17

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

ordinary courts to entertain and determine disputes falling within that

statutory scheme stands excluded to the extent so provided. Section 98

of the Agrarian Development Act further stipulates that the provisions of

that Act shall prevail notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any

other written law.

However, the Agrarian Development Act does not oust the jurisdiction of

the Primary Court merely because the dispute relates to paddy land or

the rights of a tenant cultivator of such land. For the provisions of the

Agrarian Development Act to apply and for the jurisdiction of the Primary

Court to be excluded, there must exist a landlord and tenant cultivator

relationship between the contending parties before the court. Although

one party asserts that he is the tenant cultivator of the other party, if the

other party denies the existence of such a relationship, the court will

have jurisdiction to inquire into and determine that issue. This law was

settled by Ranasinghe J. (as he then was), with the concurrence of

Sharvananda C.J. and Wanasundera J., in Suneetha Rohini Dolawatte v.

Buddhadasa Gamage (SC Appeal No. 45/83, SC Minutes of 27.09.1985),

which was cited with approval in Herath v. Peter [1989] 2 Sri LR 323 and

followed in subsequent decisions. However, it must be emphasised that

this exception operates subject to any order made under the Agrarian

Development Act, whether during the pendency or after the conclusion

of the section 66 proceedings.

In Thuduwewatte v. Shantha (SC/APPEAL/56/2018, SC Minutes of

05.02.2025), a case relating to possession of paddy land, Amarasekera

J. held at pages 13–14 as follows:

It is true that if the dispute relates to specific procedure or remedy

that falls within the Agrarian Development Act, the parties have to

finally resolved it through the mechanism provided by that Act but

if it is a dispute relating to land where the breach of peace has

occurred or is imminent, the Primary Court has power to make

provisional orders to maintain peace as contemplated by section 66

18

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

Action (……) Whatever it is, the dispute and the action before the

Primary Court was not to resolve cultivation rights or dispute

between landlord and tenant cultivators. It was based on the

dispossession caused by the Petitioner’s conduct as to the paddy

lands allegedly possessed by the 2nd Party Respondents in case

No.43361 and the police report alleged that there would be breach

of the peace moving for appropriate orders to maintain peace. Thus,

the Primary Court had power to make order till the parties get their

disputes resolved through a proper forum or a Court and get it

executed through an order or decree of a court even if such dispute

relates to cultivation rights or possession or title etc.

What Justice Amarasekera states is that the proceedings before the

Primary Court are not intended to resolve disputes between landlords

and tenant cultivators or their cultivation rights, but to address

dispossession giving rise to an imminent threat of a breach of the peace.

Accordingly, the Primary Court has jurisdiction to make an order to

prevent such breach of the peace until the dispute is resolved through

the mechanism provided by the Agrarian Development Act.

It must also be observed that, having regard to the legislative intention

underlying section 66 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, even where

the court concludes that it lacks jurisdiction by reason of the acceptance

of a landlord-tenant cultivator relationship, the court nevertheless has

inherent jurisdiction to make an appropriate interim order to maintain

the status quo, solely for the purpose of preventing a breach of the peace,

pending the parties seeking relief under the provisions of the Agrarian

Development Act.

The object of section 66 applications

The object of Part VII of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, under the

broad theme “Inquiries into Disputes Affecting Lands Where a Breach of

the Peace Is Threatened or Likely”, is to enable the Primary Court to make

a temporary and summary order under sections 68 or 69 of the Act for

19

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

the limited purpose of preventing a breach of the peace arising from a

land dispute and preserving the status quo until the substantive rights

of the parties are determined by a competent court.

The expression “competent court” in this context does not refer only to

the District Court. In Podisingho v. Chandradasa [1978/79] 2 Sri LR 93

at 96, Atukorala J. stated that the term “competent court” encompasses

a “Tribunal of competent jurisdiction”. It refers to a Court, Tribunal, or

any other Authority vested with jurisdictional competence to adjudicate

upon the substantive rights of the parties. It is in that sense that I stated

earlier that an order made by the Primary Court will subsist until the

Divisional Secretary makes an order under the Land Development

Ordinance in respect of State land, and an order is made by the Agrarian

Tribunal under the Agrarian Development Act in respect of paddy land.

The Primary Court is not a competent court to adjudicate upon the

substantive rights of parties in disputes affecting land. Its competence is

confined to the making of a provisional order to avert a breach of the

peace.

Sections 68 and 69 expressly provide that an order made thereunder

shall remain in force until it is altered or set aside by “an order or decree

of a competent court”. This position is reiterated in section 74(1).

74(1) An order under this Part shall not affect or prejudice any right

or interest in any land or part of a land which any person may be

able to establish in a civil suit; and it shall be the duty of a Judge of

a Primary Court who commences to hold an inquiry under this Part

to explain the effect of these sections to the persons concerned in the

dispute.

The failure to appreciate this limited and preventive purpose both by

Judges and litigants inevitably leads to protracted proceedings. The

present case is a stark illustration. Although the case was instituted in

2002, litigation has continued for more than twenty-three years, and the

20

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

substantive rights of the parties have yet to be adjudicated by a

competent court.

The orders a Judge of the Primary Court may make

In addition to the final orders that a Judge of the Primary Court is

empowered to make under sections 68 and 69 of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act, the Judge may, pending the conclusion of the inquiry,

make interim orders under section 67(3) of the Act.

67(3). Pending the conclusion of the inquiry it shall be lawful for the

Judge of the Primary Court to make an interim order containing any

provision which he is empowered to make under this Part at the

conclusion of the inquiry.

The Judge of the Primary Court is also empowered to make ancillary

orders, depending on the nature of the dispute. This power is conferred

by section 70 of the Act.

70. An order made under this Part may also contain such other

directions as the Judge of the Primary Court may think fit with

regard to the furnishing of security for the exercise of the right of

possession of the land or part of it or for the exercise of any right in

such land or with regard to the sale of any crop or produce or the

manner of exercise of any right in such land or the custody or

disposal of the proceeds of the sale of any crop or produce.

Section 66(8)(a) further provides that where a party or person interested

is required to enter an appearance under Part VII of the Act, such

appearance may be entered through an Attorney-at-Law. Personal

appearance is therefore not mandatory unless the Judge of the Primary

Court so directs. However, having regard to the nature of applications

under Part VII and the preventive purpose of the legislation, it is desirable

that parties be required to be personally present, as this would assist the

21

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

court in effectively assessing the situation and taking timely measures

to prevent a breach of the peace.

In terms of section 66(8)(b), where a party fails to appear or, having

appeared, fails to set out his claim by way of an affidavit and documents,

such party is deemed to be in default and is not entitled to participate in

the inquiry. Nevertheless, the court is required to consider such material

as is available before it in order to understand the nature of the dispute

and to make its determination. This includes the first information and

its annexures, police complaints, police statements, police inquiry notes,

and police field notes together with a sketch.

66(8)(b). Where a party fails to appear or having appeared fails to

file his affidavit and also his documents (if any) he shall be deemed

to be in default and not be entitled to participate at the inquiry but

the court shall consider such material as is before it respecting the

claims of such party in making its determination and order.

Section 71 prescribes the orders that the court shall make in such

circumstances.

71. Where the parties to the dispute do not appear before court or

having appeared or been produced do not file any affidavits whether

with or without documents annexed the court shall—

(a) in a case where the dispute is in regard to possession make order

permitting the party in possession to continue in possession, and

(b) in a case where the dispute is in regard to any other right, make

order permitting the status quo in regard to such right to continue.

Procedural timelines

It is of paramount importance that proceedings under section 66 be

concluded summarily and speedily.

22

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

Section 66(3) provides that on the date on which the parties are produced

before court, or on the date fixed for their appearance, the court shall

grant time not more than three weeks for the filing of affidavits together

with documents.

In terms of section 66(4), within one week of the filing of the first

information, the court is required to cause notice to be affixed in a

conspicuous place on the land, calling upon any interested persons to

intervene and file affidavits setting out their positions on the date on

which the case is next called in open court.

In terms of section 66(5), on the date affidavits are filed, and upon an

application made by the parties filing such affidavits, the court shall

grant a further period of two weeks for the filing of counter-affidavits

together with documents. However, as I stated earlier, it would be

prudent for the court to grant a further period of two weeks for the filing

of counter-affidavits, whether or not a formal application is made, as this

would assist the Judge in arriving at a correct decision.

Settlement

Upon the filing of counter-affidavits, section 66(6) mandates the court,

on the same date, to make every endeavour to induce the parties to arrive

at a settlement of the dispute. Where the parties agree to a settlement,

the terms thereof shall be recorded and signed by the parties, and the

order shall be made in accordance with such settlement. At this stage,

the court ought also to explain to the parties the provisional nature of

proceedings and encourage them, where appropriate, to institute a civil

action for the vindication of their substantive rights.

66(6). On the date fixed for filing affidavits and documents, where

no application has been made for filing counter-affidavits, or on the

date fixed for filing counter-affidavits, whether or not such affidavits

and documents have been filed, the court shall before fixing the case

for inquiry make every effort to induce the parties and the persons

23

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

interested (if any) to arrive at a settlement of the dispute and if the

parties and persons interested agree to a settlement the settlement

shall be recorded and signed by the parties and persons interested

and an order made in accordance with the terms as settled.

In terms of section 66(6), it is only after this statutory endeavour to

secure a settlement that the court shall proceed to fix the matter for

inquiry. Section 74(1) imposes a duty on the Judge of the Primary Court

who commences to hold an inquiry under Part VII to explain to the

parties concerned the temporary and provisional nature of any order

made by the court.

The next question that arises is whether the failure of the Judge of the

Primary Court to endeavour to induce the parties to settle the dispute

would render the final order a nullity.

In Ali v. Abdeen [2001] 1 Sri LR 413, Gunawardena J., sitting in the

Court of Appeal, held that such failure makes the final order invalid as

“it is the making of an effort to induce parties and the fact that the effort

was not attended with success that clothe the Primary Court with

jurisdiction to initiate an inquiry with regard to the question as to who was

in possession.” While this view has been followed in some subsequent

decisions, several other decisions have taken the contrary view.

As I have explained in Kusumalatha v. Swarnakanthi [2019] 3 Sri LR 158,

the failure of the Judge of the Primary Court to induce the parties to

settle the dispute, as contemplated by section 66(6), does not ipso facto

vitiate the subsequent proceedings. Where the Primary Court has

jurisdiction over the subject matter and is competent to make a valid

order, a party cannot remain silent, permitting the court to proceed, and

thereafter challenge the order on the basis of an alleged procedural

irregularity only when he finds that the order is against him. In terms of

section 39 of the Judicature Act, it is obligatory upon any party who

seeks to raise an objection to jurisdiction to do so at the earliest

opportunity. Failure to do so results in the objection being deemed to

24

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

have been waived, or the irregular exercise of jurisdiction being taken to

have been acquiesced in.

The judgment in Ali v. Abdeen [2001] 1 Sri LR 413 does not state the

correct position of the law insofar as it holds that non-compliance with

section 66(6) denudes the Primary Court of jurisdiction and renders the

subsequent proceedings a nullity. To that extent, the decision in Ali v.

Abdeen is overruled.

Inquiry

Where no settlement is reached, section 66(7) requires the Judge to fix

the inquiry on a date within two weeks from the date on which the case

was called for the filing of counter-affidavits.

In terms of section 67(1), every inquiry shall be held in a summary

manner and concluded within three months of its commencement.

Section 67(2) further provides that the Judge of the Primary Court shall

deliver his order within one week of the conclusion of the inquiry.

These provisions underscore the legislative intent that such inquiries be

conducted summarily and concluded expeditiously.

The material on which the Judge shall rely in determining the matter is

set out in section 72 of the Act.

72. A determination and order under this Part shall be made after

examination and consideration of—

(a) the information filed and the affidavits and documents furnished;

(b) such other evidence on any matter arising on the affidavits or

documents furnished as the court may permit to be led on that

matter; and

(c) such oral or written submission as may be permitted by the Judge

of the Primary Court in his discretion.

25

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

Given the objective of filing section 66 applications and the strict time

frame prescribed for their conclusion, inquiries into such applications

ought, as a general rule, to be disposed of by way of written submissions.

It may be noted that, in terms of section 72(a), the court shall take the

first information filed and the affidavits tendered with documents in the

determination of the case, but the permitting of oral evidence and oral or

written submissions lies within the discretion of the court.

Identification of the land

The importance of proper identification of the land in proceedings under

Part VII was emphasised in David Appuhamy v. Yassassi Thera [1987] 1

Sri LR 253.

Whether a dispute affecting land relates to the right to possession or to

any right other than possession, such as a right of way, the proper

identification of the land or the disputed portion thereof is a fundamental

requirement in proceedings under Part VII of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act. An order made without adequate identification of the

subject matter would be rendered ineffective and unenforceable.

Section 76 of the Act provides that “the Fiscal of the court shall, where

necessary, execute all orders made under the provisions of this Part.” An

order lacking clarity as to the land or right to which it relates would place

the Fiscal in an untenable position and defeat the purpose of the court’s

intervention.

Section 78 of the Act further enables the court to adopt appropriate

procedural provisions from the Code of Criminal Procedure Act or the

Civil Procedure Code, with necessary adaptations, where the Act makes

no express provision.

Identification of the land need not necessarily be by way of a survey plan.

It may be achieved by a sketch depicting clearly identifiable boundaries,

landmarks, or other distinguishing features. In practice, the police

26

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

usually tender a sketch together with their scene visit notes when filing

the first information. Where no such sketch is produced, or where

identification is unclear or disputed, the Judge of the Primary Court may

require the police or the parties to furnish an appropriate sketch or other

material, either at the time of filing affidavits or at the inquiry.

Local inspection

As I have discussed in Meherun Nisa v. Umma Nisa

(CA/REV/1247/2006, CA Minutes of 29.11.2019), it is permissible for a

Judge of the Primary Court to dispose of an inquiry, with the consent of

the parties, by way of a local inspection or scene visit. As Tennakoon J.

(as he then was) held in Walliammai v. Selliah (1970) 73 NLR 509 at 512,

there is “no illegality in the parties informing the court that the only

evidence in the case would be that afforded by a local inspection by the

Judge.” This method has been frequently adopted in the past by Judges

of the Primary Court, particularly in disputes relating to rights other than

the right to possession, such as rights of way.

This mode of concluding cases by way of a local inspection conducted by

the Judge at the invitation of the parties is not a recent development. As

Seneviratne J. observed in Perera v. Belin Menike [1982] 1 Sri LR 206 at

211, “This practice, as is well known, still continues. Thus, this mode of

settlement has prevailed for eight decades.”

The District Court is expressly empowered to conduct a local inspection

under section 428 of the Civil Procedure Code. As I stated previously,

section 78 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act provides that where any

matter arises for which no provision is made in the Act, the provisions of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act or the Civil Procedure Code, as the

case may be, shall, with such suitable adaptations as the justice of the

case may require, be adopted and applied.

Prior to undertaking a local inspection, the intention of the parties

should be clearly recorded, and the signatures of the parties obtained,

27

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

signifying their consent to abide by any decision given by court on the

basis of such inspection.

A local inspection may also be resorted to for the limited purpose of

clarifying specific factual matters arising in the inquiry, without

necessarily making the final order solely or exclusively on the Judge’s

observations at the scene.

It must, however, be emphasised that the Judge must exercise caution

to ensure that observations made at the scene do not transgress the

preventive jurisdiction conferred by section 66, nor result in an

adjudication of substantive rights reserved for determination by a court

of competent jurisdiction. A local inspection may best be utilised to

facilitate a consensual resolution of the dispute at the scene.

Exercise of revisionary jurisdiction

Courts must remain vigilant to ensure that their processes are not

abused for collateral purposes. Litigation is not a commercial enterprise.

The present matter concerns the affairs of a popular Kovil, where

substantial revenue is generated through offerings made by devotees. In

such circumstances, even provisional orders made under Part VII of the

Primary Courts’ Procedure Act may have a significant bearing on the

management and control of income during the pendency of proceedings.

This reality underscores the need for particular circumspection in the

exercise of revisionary jurisdiction.

Section 74(2) of the Act expressly provides that no appeal shall lie against

an order made by a Judge of the Primary Court under Part VII, although

such orders remain amenable to revision. The denial of a right of appeal

is a clear legislative indication that orders made under section 66 are

provisional in character and are intended to operate only until the parties

seek a determination of their substantive rights before a court of

competent jurisdiction, ordinarily the District Court.

28

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

In the instant case, had the High Court declined to entertain the revision

application, the first party would have been compelled, if so advised, to

promptly institute appropriate civil proceedings to vindicate any

substantive rights claimed by them and obtain an appropriate interim

order. The dispute could thereby have been finally resolved many years

ago.

In this context, Judges of the High Court may exercise restraint in

entertaining applications for revision against orders of the Primary Court

made under Part VII. Revisionary jurisdiction should be invoked only

where the impugned order is ex facie perverse, discloses a patent error

of law or facts, or results in a manifest miscarriage of justice. In the

absence of such circumstances, interference with a provisional order

undermines the legislative objective underlying Part VII and serves only

to protract disputes that the statute intends to resolve summarily.

The present case illustrates the consequences of a failure to observe such

restraint. Although the legislature deliberately denied a right of appeal in

order to ensure expeditious resolution, the invocation of revisionary

jurisdiction has, in this instance, proved counterproductive. More than

twenty-three years after the making of a provisional order, the parties

remain embroiled in litigation, with their substantive rights yet to be

adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Stay of proceedings

There is no dispute that the mere filing of a revision application in the

High Court against the final order of the Primary Court does not

automatically stay the execution of proceedings of the Primary Court.

However, there was previously a divergence of opinion regarding the stay

of proceedings where an appeal is filed before the Court of Appeal against

a judgment of the High Court made in the exercise of its revisionary

jurisdiction from the final order of the Primary Court. This issue was

finally settled by Salam J. in the Divisional Bench decision of the Court

29

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

of Appeal in Jayantha Gunasekara v. Jayatissa Gunasekara [2011] 1 Sri

LR 284, where His Lordship, after analysing the relevant law and the

legislative intent underlying the introduction of Part VII of the Primary

Courts’ Procedure Act, held at page 300 that “the mere lodging of an

appeal against the judgment of the High Court, in the exercise of its

revisionary power in terms of Article 154P(3)(b) of the Constitution, to the

Court of Appeal does not automatically stay the execution of the order of

the High Court.” I am in respectful agreement with that conclusion.

Pending Civil Action

The pendency of a civil action before the District Court in respect of the

same land dispute does not, by itself, oust the jurisdiction of the Primary

Court to make an order under Part VII of the Primary Courts’ Procedure

Act. Where a dispute affecting land gives rise to a threatened or likely

breach of the peace, the Primary Court remains competent to entertain

an application and to make a suitable order to prevent such breach.

As Sharvananda J. observed in Kanagasabai v. Mylwaganam (1976) 78

NLR 280 at 284:

If the mere institution of a suit in a civil Court is sufficient to divest

the Magistrate of his jurisdiction, the whole purpose of section 62

will be defeated. A scheming party will be enabled to play hide and

seek. A person who has taken forcible possession, realising that the

decision of the Magistrate would go against him, may rush to a Civil

Court to stall for time and in the meanwhile continue to be in

unlawful possession of the premises. The law cannot countenance

any such action which is calculated to render nugatory the

proceedings before the Magistrate.

However, the further observation made by Sharvananda J. in the same

case at page 285, namely, “if the Magistrate has already made an order

under section 63 of the Administration of Justice Law, in my view, the civil

court will not have jurisdiction to make any interim order which will in any

30

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

way prejudice the right of a party who has succeeded in getting an order

in his favour under section 63 of the Administration of Justice Law”, has

sometimes been misunderstood and misapplied. Reliance on that

observation has led dissatisfied parties to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court instead of promptly instituting civil

proceedings and, where necessary, seeking appropriate interim relief, as

District Courts are reluctant to grant interim injunctions that are

inconsistent with orders made by the Primary Court. The present case,

involving complex and substantive questions of fact and law, including

the applicability of the Trusts Ordinance, which fall squarely within the

jurisdiction of the District Court, provides a classic example. Following

the order of the Primary Court, the first party did not go before the

District Court but instead pursued a course which has resulted in the

present litigation against a provisional order, now continuing for over two

decades.

It may be observed that sections 68 and 69 of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act expressly provide that an order made by a Judge of the

Primary Court shall remain in force until it is altered or set aside by “an

order or decree of a competent court”, and not until it is altered or set

aside by “a judgment of a competent court”. This clearly signifies that a

court of competent jurisdiction, including the District Court, may make

a contrary order not only upon the conclusion of the trial but also during

the pendency of the action.

I need hardly emphasise that the jurisdiction of the District Court to

issue interim injunctions, though provisional in nature, is far wider than

the jurisdiction of the Primary Court to make an order under Part VII of

the Act. When considering an application for an interim injunction, the

District Court can, inter alia, go into the merits of the case and even grant

the final relief as the interim relief. In Shell Gas Lanka Ltd. v. Samyang

Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. [2005] 3 Sri LR 14, Wimalachandra J. held that where

there is a strong prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff, the balance of

convenience also favours him, and no plausible defence is available to

31

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

the defendant, it is not contrary to law to grant an interim injunction

even if such injunction gives the plaintiff the substantial relief claimed

by him. This principle was subsequently cited with approval by the

Supreme Court in People’s Bank v. Yasasiri Kasthuriarachchi [2010] 1

Sri LR 227.

I therefore take the view that the District Court, being a court of

competent jurisdiction, is not precluded from making an interim

injunction in a properly constituted civil action, even if such order is

inconsistent with the order made by the Primary Court, where such

intervention is necessary to protect the substantive rights of the parties.

However, the District Court shall exercise such jurisdiction with extreme

caution and circumspection and not as a matter of course.

Section 68

The final orders that a Judge of the Primary Court may make under Part

VII of the Act are set out in sections 68 and 69.

Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof,

the Judge is required to make an order in terms of section 68 of the Act.

Section 68 provides as follows:

68(1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part

thereof it shall be the duty of the Judge of the Primary Court holding

the inquiry to determine as to who was in possession of the land or

the part on the date of the filing of the information under section 66

and make order as to who is entitled to possession of such land or

part thereof.

(2) An order under subsection (1) shall declare any one or more

persons therein specified to be entitled to the possession of the land

or the part in the manner specified in such order until such person

or persons are evicted therefrom under an order or decree of a

32

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

competent court, and prohibit all disturbance of such possession

otherwise than under the authority of such an order or decree.

(3) Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the

possession of any land or any part of a land the Judge of the

Primary Court is satisfied that any person who had been in

possession of the land or part has been forcibly dispossessed within

a period of two months immediately before the date on which the

information was filed under section 66, he may make a

determination to that effect and make an order directing that the

party dispossessed be restored to possession and prohibiting all

disturbance of such possession otherwise than under the authority

of an order or decree of a competent court.

(4) An order under subsection (1) may contain in addition to the

declaration and prohibition referred to in subsection (2), a direction

that any party specified in the order shall be restored to the

possession of the land or any part thereof specified in such order.

The scheme of section 68 is simple and straightforward.

First, in terms of section 68(1), the Judge shall determine who was in

possession of the land on the date of the filing of the first information

under section 66(1) and make the order confirming possession of that

party. This constitutes the general rule.

Section 68(3) provides an exception to this general rule. In terms of that

provision, where the Judge of the Primary Court is satisfied that a person

who had been in possession of the land has been forcibly dispossessed

within a period of two months immediately preceding the date on which

the first information was filed, the Judge shall make the order directing

that the party so dispossessed be restored to possession.

33

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

The expression “forcibly dispossessed” does not connote the use of

physical force or violence. It signifies dispossession otherwise than in

due course of law.

The nature of possession

The next question concerns the nature of the possession envisaged by

section 68. The possession contemplated under section 68 of the Primary

Courts’ Procedure Act is actual or de facto possession. Such possession

must not be confused with title, a legal right to possession, or lawful

possession.

Although section 68(1) provides that the Judge shall “make order as to

who is entitled to possession of such land”, and section 68(3) describes

the inquiry as “an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the

possession of any land”, these expressions do not confer upon the Judge

of the Primary Court the power to determine questions of ownership,

title, or legal entitlement to possession. Such matters remain exclusively

within the jurisdiction of a competent court. In this statutory context,

the phrase “entitled to possession” means no more than an entitlement

to retain actual possession until dispossession in due course of law.

Accordingly, even where an owner who had been in lawful possession of

the land is forcibly dispossessed by a person having no title whatsoever,

if such owner fails to invoke the jurisdiction of the Primary Court within

two months of the dispossession, the Judge of the Primary Court is

bound to confirm possession of the person in unlawful possession at the

time of the filing of the first information, leaving the lawful owner to seek

appropriate relief before a competent court.

In Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [1982] 2 Sri LR 693, Sharvananda J., at

pages 698–699, emphasised the requirement of “actual possession” in

proceedings under section 68 in the following manner:

34

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

Thus, the duty of the Judge in proceedings under section 68 is to

ascertain which party was or deemed to have been in possession on

the relevant date, namely, on the date of the filing of the information

under section 66. Under section 68 the Judge is bound to maintain

the possession of such person even if he be a rank trespasser as

against any interference even by the rightful owner. This section

entities even a squatter to the protection of the law, unless his

possession was acquired within two months of the filing of the

information. That person is entitled to possession until he is evicted

by due process of law. A Judge should therefore in an inquiry under

Part VII of the aforesaid Act, confine himself to the question of actual

possession on the date of filing of the information except in a case

where a person who had been in possession of the land had been

dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the

date of the information. He is not to decide any question of title or

right to possession of the parties to the land.

The provision corresponding to section 68 of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act is section 145 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure,

1973. In this regard, Sohoni’s Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (22nd

Edition 2018), Vol. I, at page 1462, states as follows:

This section is concerned solely with the fact of actual physical

possession, whether lawful or unlawful, whether in contemplation

of law enjoyed by the possessor in his own right or on behalf of

others. Therefore, in proceedings under this section any question as

to whether possession is on behalf of others or in one’s own right is

quite irrelevant. It is actual possession which is not under his right

to possess nor it is which amounts to lawful or legal possession. In

short, it is physical and continuous possession. It is clear from

subsection 4 that the Magistrate is prevented from going into the

merits of title or claim. So, any person or third party who may

intervene in the dispute showing his right to possess or title to

35

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

possess on the basis of some transaction, cannot be competent to

invite the Magistrate to decide his claim.

Similarly, Sarkar on the Code of Criminal Procedure (12th Edition 2019),

Vol. I, at page 614, observes:

As section 145 is concerned only with the question of actual

possession, question of title should not be decided or allowed to be

agitated. Proceedings may be much shortened in many cases and

rendered less difficult only if questions of title are kept at arm’s

length. It has been repeatedly held that questions of title or the right

to possession are beyond the scope of section 145.

The character of possession contemplated in proceedings relating to

disputes affecting land has been lucidly explained in Sohan Mushar v.

Kailash Singh (AIR 1962 Patna 249), where the court held as follows:

The possession contemplated in this section [section 145(1) of the

Indian Code of Criminal Procedure] is the “actual possession of the

subject of dispute”. Actual physical possession means the

possession of the person who has his feet on the land, who is

ploughing it, sowing or growing crops in if, entirely irrespective of

whether he has any right or title to possess it. But ‘actual

possession’ does not always mean ‘actual physical possession’. For

example, if there is a tenant occupying a house and there is dispute

between two persons, each claiming to be the landlord, admittedly

neither is in actual physical possession, still a proceeding under

section 145 of the Code will lie, and in such a case, the decision will

rest upon who is in “actual possession” by realisation of rent from

the tenant. ‘Actual possession’, postulated by sub-section (1) of

section 145, however, is not the same as a ‘right to possession’ nor

does it necessarily mean lawful or legal possession. It includes even

the possession of a mere trespasser. It should, however, be read

and tangible, that is, there should be effective occupation and

control over the property.

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

Although the question of title is ordinarily wholly irrelevant in

proceedings of this nature, the court may, in rare and exceptional cases,

make limited reference to title solely for the purpose of resolving the issue

of possession, where the court is unable to arrive at a conclusion on

possession either due to a lack of reliable evidence or because the

competing parties have adduced evidence of equal probative value. In

such circumstances, the court may advert to title, guided by the principle

that possession is an essential incident of title and that, accordingly, the

owner is prima facie entitled to possession. I must emphasise that the

applicability of this exception is extremely rare. This position was also

affirmed by Sharvananda J. in Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [1982] 2 Sri

LR 693 at 699. In this regard, Sohoni’s Code of Criminal Procedure (op.

cit.) at page 1483 states as follows:

Evidence bearing on title can be considered only in two instances,

one, in which the property admits of no actual possession, and

second, in which the evidence as to possession is equally balanced

and the presumption of possession which flows from title can be of

help in a correct decision of the question of possession.

However, the term “possession” is an intricate and subtle legal concept,

assuming different legal meanings depending on the factual and legal

context in which it arises.

In Salmond on Jurisprudence, (12th Edition 2004), edited by P. J.

Fitzgerald, at page 266, the learned author observes that the concept of

possession is inherently difficult to define, as it is an abstract notion and

not one that is purely legal in character. He states:

Whether a person has ownership depends on rules of law; whether

he has possession is a question that could be answered as a matter

of fact and without reference to law at all.

Salmond further explains, at page 282, that possession in law is not

confined to direct possession:

37

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

In law one person may possess a thing for and on account of

someone else. In such a case the latter is in possession by the

agency of him who so holds the thing on his behalf. The possession

thus held by one man through another may be termed mediate,

while that which is acquired or retained directly or personally may

be distinguished as immediate or direct.

Accordingly, while the right to possession ordinarily resides in the owner,

another may nevertheless be in actual possession of the property.

Possession exercised by the owner through another is recognised in law

and is commonly described as mediate or constructive possession, as

distinct from immediate or direct possession.

Nevertheless, as a general rule, what is material for the purposes of

section 68 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act is actual possession, and

not constructive or derivative possession.

However, actual possession has not always been understood to mean

actual physical possession.

For example, in Ranchi Zamindari Co. Ltd. v. Pratab Udainath Sahi Deo

(AIR 1939 Patna 209), for the purposes under section 145 of the Indian

Code of Criminal Procedure, the owner of unworked minerals was held

to be in actual possession thereof where he was in a position, at any

moment, either to work them himself or to permit others to do so.

Similarly, as illustrated in Sohan Mushar v. Kailash Singh (AIR 1962

Patna 249), where a tenant is in occupation of a house and a dispute

arises between two persons each claiming to be the landlord, neither

claimant is in actual physical possession. Nevertheless, proceedings

under section 145 of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure would lie,

and the determination would turn on who is in actual possession by

reference to who collects rent from the tenant.

38

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

In Iqbal v. Majedudeen [1999] 3 Sri LR 213, following the death of her

husband, the respondent went to live with her mother, having locked up

the premises where she had previously resided. The appellant, upon

returning to Sri Lanka, broke open the door and entered into possession

within two months prior to the filing of the first information. The court

held that the respondent remained in actual possession, emphasising

that actual possession does not require uninterrupted physical presence

throughout the day, and may subsist notwithstanding temporary

absence.

Mediate or constructive possession typically arises in recognised legal

relationships where control over property is exercised through another,

including relationships such as landlord and tenant, lessor and lessee,

licensor and licensee, principal and agent, and master and servant. In

proceedings instituted under section 66(1) of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act, there is general acceptance that, as against third parties,

the possession of the latter is, in law, attributable to the former. Thus,

where a dispute as to possession arises between a principal and a third

party, the principal may rely on the possession of the agent,

notwithstanding the absence of actual physical possession.

The critical question, however, is whether this principle applies with

equal force where the dispute regarding possession is between the former

and the latter themselves, that is, between the principal and the agent.

Judicial opinion on this issue is divided, and no settled or uniform

position has yet emerged.

One line of authority proceeds on the premise that possession capable of

being asserted in such proceedings must be referable to a claim or right

to possession, and that permissive or derivative possession enjoyed by

an agent or servant cannot confer upon such person an independent

standing as against the principal or master. According to this view, a

person who enters into possession on behalf of another cannot

39

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

subsequently repudiate the character of that possession so as to exclude

the person for whom such possession was originally held.

The other line of authority proceeds on the footing that an inquiry under

this provision must remain strictly confined to the determination of

actual possession. On this approach, the court should not be drawn into

questions of title or legal entitlement, which properly fall within the

domain of the civil courts. It therefore rejects any inflexible rule that an

agent or servant can never assert possession in such proceedings,

holding instead that the question must depend on the particular facts

and circumstances of each case.

This divergence of views is succinctly captured in Sohoni’s Code of

Criminal Procedure (op. cit.) at page 1421, where the learned author

states:

A view has also been taken that possession which may be pleaded

under this section must be based on a claim or right of possession,

and that possession of an agent or servant which is permissive,

cannot give him a locus standi as against his principle or master. If

possession has been given as a servant or employee, he cannot set

up his possession to the exclusion of his employer. Pujaris are mere

servants of the trustees. It should be borne in mind that possession

of a trespasser would always be exclusively on his own. But when

initially a person enters into possession for and on behalf of another,

he will not be allowed to turn around all of a sudden and voluntarily

disclaim the nature of that possession and exclude the persons for

and on whose behalf he had entered into that possession.

The other view, however, is that though in rare and exceptional

cases that may be possible, the scope of an enquiry under this

section is not to be extended beyond the determination of actual

possession, and that the parties be allowed to agitate complicated

questions of title in civil courts, and that it cannot be laid down as

an inflexible rule of law that in no case can agent set up possession

40

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

under this section. The question must turn upon the facts and

circumstances of each case.

Further guidance on this issue is found in Sarkar on the Code of Criminal

Procedure (op. cit.) at page 603:

Possession of agent or servant is possession of master as section

145 is not meant to protect the possession of servant or manager

against his master [Thaylee, AIR 1923 M 60; Perumal, 34 CrLJ 88;

Bajirao, AIR 1926 N 286; Balak Das v. Bhagwan Das, AIR 1960 Pat

60: 1960 CrLJ 269:1959 BLJR 407]. But when the dispute is

between master and servant about possession, it cannot be said

that in no case can be invoked under section 145 [Thakur Jaikrit

Singh v. Sohan Raj, AIR 1959 Raj 63: 1959 CrLJ 379: 1959 Raj LW

140].

A licensee may continue in possession even after the termination of his

licence and assert a claim of prescriptive title. A lessee may refuse to

vacate the premises on the footing that he has become a statutory tenant

upon the expiry of the lease. An agent may resist vacating the property

until he is compensated for improvements effected thereon, invoking the

right of jus retentionis. In such situations, can the licensor, lessor, or

principal forcibly evict the person in possession, without recourse to

court, on the footing that the possession of the latter is, in law, the

possession of the former? Would not such conduct be likely to result in

a serious breach of the peace?

Having regard to the object of the legislation and the scheme of the

Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, I am of the view that while, in a dispute

affecting land between a principal and a third party, the possession of an

agent may in law be attributed to the principal, where a dispute affecting

land arises between a principal and an agent, the court should not

proceed on the footing that the possession of the agent is necessarily the

possession of the principal. The same principle applies, mutatis

mutandis, to other recognised legal relationships involving derivative or

41

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

permissive possession, such as landlord and tenant, lessor and lessee,

licensor and licensee, and master and servant.

This distinction flows from the fact that proceedings under section 66

are concerned solely with actual physical possession, and not with

constructive or derivative possession. Questions relating to the right or

entitlement to possession are wholly irrelevant in proceedings instituted

for the limited purpose of preventing a threatened or likely breach of the

peace.

Let me now recapitulate the nature of possession contemplated under

section 68 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act.

Under section 68:

(a) What is required is actual possession. Actual possession denotes

actual or de facto possession, that is, direct or immediate

possession.

(b) Where a dispute as to possession arises, such as between a

landlord, lessor, licensor, principal, or master and a third party,

the possession of a tenant, lessee, licensee, agent, or servant may,

in law, be attributed to the former. Such possession is commonly

described as constructive or mediate possession.

(c) However, where the dispute regarding possession is between the

parties to such a relationship themselves—such as landlord and

tenant, lessor and lessee, licensor and licensee, principal and

agent, or master and servant—the court shall have regard to actual

physical possession, and not to constructive or derivative

possession, for the limited purpose of proceedings under section

68.

Section 69

Section 68 governs disputes relating to the right to possession, whereas

section 69 applies where the dispute affecting land relates to any right

other than the right to possession. Section 69 provides as follows:

42

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

69(1) Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part

of a land, other than the right to possession of such land or part

thereof, the Judge of the Primary Court shall determine as to who is

entitled to the right which is the subject of the dispute and make an

order under subsection (2).

(2) An order under this subsection may declare that any person

specified therein shall be entitled to any such right in or respecting

the land or in any part of the land as may be specified in the order

until such person is deprived of such right by virtue of an order or

decree of a competent court, and prohibit all disturbance or

interference with the exercise of such right by such party other than

under the authority of an order or decree as aforesaid.

In terms of section 69, where a dispute affecting land relates to a right

other than possession, the Judge of the Primary Court is required to

determine who is entitled to that right and to make an appropriate order.

Section 75 clarifies that rights falling within the ambit of section 69

include the right to cultivate land, the right to crops or produce, and

rights in the nature of servitudes.

The question arises whether there is a higher degree of proof under

section 69 than section 68. As I have discussed earlier, although section

68 also uses the expressions “the right to the possession” and “entitled

to possession”, the courts have consistently interpreted those

expressions to mean actual de facto possession or an entitlement to

retain possession, without entering into the merits of the competing

claims.

It is relevant to note that the same phraseology is employed in section

69, the only distinction being that section 68 concerns “who is entitled

to possession”, whereas section 69 concerns “who is entitled to the right”

other than the right to possession. Both provisions form part of Part VII

of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act, and the legislative intention

underlying them is identical, namely the prevention of a breach of the

43

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

peace arising out of land disputes, pending a determination on the merits

by a court of competent jurisdiction. Consistently with this shared

objective, proceedings under sections 68 and 69 are governed by the

same procedural framework and are subject to the same statutory

timelines for their summary disposal. If the legislature had intended to

require a higher degree of proof under section 69, it would have made

that intention explicit by prescribing a different procedural framework

and a different form of inquiry. In substance, sections 68 and 69 operate

as complementary provisions within the same statutory scheme.

When the legislature employs the same word or expression in different

provisions of the same statute, it is presumed to have intended that

expression to bear the same meaning throughout, particularly where the

provisions form part of the same statutory scheme or relate to the same

subject matter, and there is no indication of a contrary legislative

intention. This presumption promotes coherence, certainty, and internal

consistency in statutory interpretation.

The principle is well stated in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes

(12ᵗʰ Edition 1969) at page 278, where the learned author observes:

It has been justly remarked that, when precision is required, no

safer rule can be followed than always to call the same thing by the

same name. It is, at all events, reasonable to presume that the same

meaning is implied by the use of the same expression in every part

of an Act. Accordingly, in ascertaining the meaning to be attached to

a particular word in a section of an Act, though the proper cause

would seem to be to ascertain that meaning from a consideration of

the section itself if possible, yet, if the meaning cannot be so

ascertained, other sections may be looked at to fix the sense in

which the word is there used. Furthermore, where a word has been

construed judicially in a certain legal area, it is, I think, right to give

it the same meaning if it occurs in a statute dealing with the same

44

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

general subject matter, unless the context makes it clear that the

word must have a different construction.

In Ramalingam v. Thangarajah [1982] 2 Sri LR 693 at 699, Sharvananda

J. explained the scope of section 69 of the Act in the following terms:

On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land

other than right of possession of such land, the question for decision,

according to section 69(1), is who is entitled to the right which is

subject of dispute. The word “entitle” here connotes the ownership

of the right. The Court has to determine which of the parties has

acquired that right, or is entitled for the time being to exercise that

right. In contradistinction to section 68, section 69 requires the Court

to determine the question which party is entitled to the disputed

right preliminary to making an order under section 69(2).

The dicta make it clear that, in order to obtain relief under section 69 in

respect of a right other than possession, a party must satisfy the court,

on the material placed before it, either:

(a) that he has acquired the right in question; or

(b) that he is entitled, for the time being, to exercise that right.

I had an occasion to discuss the scope of section 69 in the Court of

Appeal in Bernard v. Attorney-General [2019] 2 Sri LR 228, where at page

234 I stated as follows:

There is a common misbelief that a high degree of proof of all the

necessary ingredients to establish such a right is necessary even

under section 69 of the Primary Courts’ Procedure Act. It must be

emphasised that a party seeking relief under section 69 need not

establish entitlement to the right in the manner he is required to

establish such entitlement before the District Court. For the purpose

of this section, it would be sufficient for such party to satisfy the

Magistrate that he “is entitled for the time being to exercise that

right”.

45

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

It must be made clear that under section 68 or 69, the inquiry before

the Magistrate’s Court cannot be converted to a full-blown civil trial.

The jurisdiction of the Magistrate cannot exceed the objective of this

special piece of legislation, which is to make a provisional order in

terms of the law to prevent a breach of the peace until the

substantive rights of the parties are established, as seen from

section 73 of the Act, “in a civil suit”. If a high standard of proof is

expected to be established before the Magistrate’s Court in section

66 proceedings, there is no necessity to go before the District Court

for the second time. If that is what is expected, it is meaningless to

say in section 74 that the order of the Magistrate “shall not affect or

prejudice any right or interest in any land or part of a land which

any person may be able to establish in a civil suit”.

In my view, the word “entitled” appearing in section 69 need not be

given undue weight or importance.

My learned brother, Justice Wijeratne, in a recent judgment of this court

in Pallemulla v. Ananda (SC/APPEAL/27/2023, SC Minutes of

12.11.2025), did not dissent from the foregoing view, but emphasised

that “actual use” or “mere user for the time being” is inadequate to

establish an entitlement in the nature of a servitude for the purposes of

section 69. His Lordship further observed that, “However, the expression

‘in the nature of’ inherently suggests that the right need not be proved as

a servitude in the manner required in a civil action; nevertheless, the right

must retain the essential characteristics of a servitude. It must also be

emphasized that a case determined solely on documentary evidence and

affidavits cannot be equated with findings reached after a full-scale trial

in the District Court.” I entirely agree.

I accept that, unlike in the case of section 68, the scope and application

of section 69 are attended by a degree of uncertainty. However, it does

not mean that section 68 is entirely free from ambiguity, particularly with

regard to the nature of possession contemplated thereunder. The

46

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

expression “entitled, for the time being, to exercise that right” should

never be understood to mean that, in making an order under section 69,

the court is required to confirm the right (other than the right to

possession) merely because it was being exercised at the time of the filing

of the first information, as is done under section 68(1). The Judge of the

Primary Court is required to look for additional material, though not of

the same quality or extent as would be required by a District Judge if the

matter were brought before the District Court in a properly constituted

civil action. Under section 69, the question whether a party has satisfied

the court that he is “entitled, for the time being, to exercise the right”

depends on the nature of the right asserted and the unique facts and

circumstances of each case.

Under section 68, a party seeking restoration of possession on the basis

of forcible dispossession is required to invoke the jurisdiction of the

Primary Court within two months of such dispossession. Section 69, by

contrast, does not prescribe a specific time limit where the dispute

relates to a right other than possession. That omission, however, does

not imply that the jurisdiction of the Primary Court may be invoked at

any time without restraint.

Having regard to the clear legislative purpose of Part VII, namely, the

prevention of threatened or likely breaches of the peace arising from land

disputes, a party seeking relief under section 69 must approach the

Primary Court within a reasonable time of the alleged disturbance or

denial of the right, as I observed in Bernard v. Attorney General (supra).

What constitutes a reasonable time is necessarily fact-sensitive and

cannot be reduced to a rigid formula. Undue delay may properly weigh

against the grant of relief, as it would be inconsistent with the preventive

and provisional character of the jurisdiction conferred by the Act.

Applicability of the law to the facts of this case and conclusion

What transpired in the instant case is largely undisputed. The factual

background has already been set out earlier in this judgment. To

47

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

recapitulate briefly, the Officer-in-Charge of the Police Station, Kopay,

filed the first information on 11.09.2002 under section 66(1)(a) of the

Primary Courts’ Procedure Act.

In their affidavit, the first party admitted that the second party had been

functioning as the priest of the Kovil since 1998, though they asserted

that he had been appointed by the Board of Management. They further

claimed that the Kovil is a public temple and that the second party had

admitted this in writing. The first party candidly admitted that, being

dissatisfied with what they described as the arbitrary conduct of the

second party, they forcibly broke open the Kovil on 05.09.2002 and

recommenced religious rituals through another priest. Their position

before the Primary Court was that they had acted lawfully and that the

Primary Court lacked jurisdiction on the footing that the dispute related

to trusteeship.

The second party categorically denied that the Kovil was a public temple.

He asserted that it was private property descending from his ancestors

and that he had remained in possession of the Kovil and functioned as

its chief priest exercising full control over its affairs, until he was forcibly

dispossessed on 05.09.2002. He prayed for restoration of possession

until the first party obtained appropriate relief from a competent court.

On these facts it is abundantly clear that, when the second party had

been in possession at least from 1998, the forcible dispossession took

place within two months before the first information was filed (as the first

information was filed on 11.09.2002 and the dispossession took place on

05.09.2002). Hence, the learned Judge of the Primary Court correctly

applied section 68(3) of the Act and ordered restoration of possession to

the second party.

The learned High Court Judge, however, gravely misdirected himself by

embarking upon an examination of the competing claims of the parties

relating to ownership, trusteeship, the status of the Kovil, and other

substantive matters, and by ultimately accepting the version advanced

48

SC/APPEAL/140/2019

by the first party on those issues. Such matters lay wholly outside the

limited and preventive jurisdiction conferred on the Primary Court under

Part VII of the Act and were, correspondingly, beyond the proper scope

of revisionary scrutiny.

As I have already explained, even assuming that the second party stood

in a relationship of agency to the first party, where the dispute affecting

land is between the principal and the agent themselves, the principle

that the possession of the agent is the possession of the principal has no

application in proceedings under Part VII of the Primary Courts’

Procedure Act. What is decisive for the purposes of such proceedings is

actual physical possession and the prevention of a breach of the peace,

not the legal right to possession or the merits of competing claims.

In these circumstances, the Court of Appeal was correct in setting aside

the judgment of the High Court and in restoring the order of the Primary

Court.

Accordingly, I answer the questions of law on which leave to appeal was

granted in the negative. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
