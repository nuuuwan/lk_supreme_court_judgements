1. Factual Background

1.1. Plaintiff’s Position

By Plaint dated 23/10/2006, the Plaintiff–Respondent, the producer of the film

Parasathumal, instituted action in the Commercial High Court of Colombo in Case No.

HC (Civil) 53/2006/03, alleging infringement of his intellectual property rights in

respect of the said audiovisual work.

In paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Plaint, the Plaintiff–Respondent stated that he is the

producer and lawful owner of economic rights in the said film and that he incurred a

cost of Rs. 200,000 for the production, promotion, and other related expenses of the

movie in 1964/1965.

In paragraph 8, he stated that the film was remastered in 2004 using Kodak films, and

that he incurred a cost of Rs. 2,000,000/= for that process.

In paragraphs 9 and 10, he stated that subsequent to the remastering, he had entered

into a contract with Ceylon Theaters to broadcast the film in theatres and that, since

then, he had entered into several written agreements with different parties to

broadcast the film to the public.

He further alleged that, without his authority, the 1st Defendant–Appellant distributed

copies of the film for television broadcast. Such unauthorized telecasting allegedly

took place on “Derana” on or about 08/03/2006 and on “Sirasa” on or about

30/09/2006. He stated that he sent a letter of demand to Derana and that, in reply,

Derana indicated that the version telecast was a copy of the film supplied by the

Defendant.

Page 4 of 23

He further stated that he subsequently learned that Sirasa was planning to telecast the

film as part of a tribute program held in memory of the late Gamini Fonseka. After

becoming aware of this intended telecast, he stated that he caused a letter to be sent

to Sirasa by his Attorney, informing Sirasa that he was the lawful owner of the film,

that he had not surrendered or assigned his rights to any person, and that if Sirasa so

desired, it could obtain the film from the Plaintiff. Notwithstanding the said letter,

Sirasa proceeded to broadcast the film on or about 30/09/2006. He further stated

that he later learned that the Defendant had provided a copy to Sirasa.

In the plaint, the Plaintiff–Respondent sought interim relief and damages, alleging

that the Defendant had violated his intellectual property rights, had been unjustly

enriched, and that the Plaintiff had suffered loss as a result of the Defendant’s actions.

He sought, inter alia, an order directing the Appellant to hand over possession of

audio-visual discs and other material containing the audio-visual work

Parasathumal, a permanent injunction restraining the use of copies of the work for

public screening and/or any other commercial purpose, and an interim injunction

pending the final determination of the action.

The Plaintiff-Respondent claimed Rs. 10,000,000 as damages, together with legal

interest.

1.2. Defendant’s Position

The 1st Defendant–Appellant by Answer dated 18/09/2007, admitted and

acknowledged that the Plaintiff–Respondent produced the film. However, it was his

position that he was entitled to exploit the broadcast/public exhibition rights on the

basis that such rights had been acquired from a third party, Warnakulasuriya Walter

Fernando, who was said to have obtained rights from the Plaintiff–Respondent and

thereafter sold the relevant television/broadcast rights to the Defendant.

Page 5 of 23

In the Answer, the Defendant averred, inter alia, that, at the time of instituting the

action, the Plaintiff had assigned the relevant intellectual property rights to Walter

Fernando and therefore did not possess such rights. Accordingly, no cause of action

had arisen against the Defendant. The Defendant further pleaded that the Plaintiff–

Respondent was estopped by acquiescence and, in any event, that the cause of action

was prescribed.

The Defendant stated that the applicable law was the Intellectual Property Code of

1979 and that, as the film was produced prior to the enactment of the Intellectual

Property Act No. 36 of 2003, the Plaintiff–Respondent had no legal basis to claim

relief under the said Act. The Appellant further stated that any use of the work by him

was in good faith and prayed that the action be dismissed with costs.

1.3. The trial.

On 19/11/2007, the Defendant made an application by way of Petition and Affidavit

to add the said Warnakulasuriya Walter Fernando as an added defendant. The

Plaintiff–Respondent filed his Statement of Objections dated 29/02/2008.

Thereupon, the Court allowed the addition of the said Warnakulasuriya Walter

Fernando as an added defendant by order dated 05/09/2008.

However, the said Warnakulasuriya Walter Fernando passed away before filing

Answer. The Plaintiff thereafter filed a Petition and Affidavit under Section 393 of the

Civil Procedure Code dated 11/05/2011, stating inter alia, that since no cause of action

had been pleaded against the said Warnakulasuriya Walter Fernando, the Plaintiff

moved that the case proceed only against the 1st Defendant. By order dated

06/07/2012, the Court permitted the action to proceed against the 1st. Defendant–

Appellant without substitution.

Page 6 of 23

The Plaintiff–Respondent also instituted a separate action against MTV Channel

(Private) Limited pertaining to the same subject matter, bearing Case No. HC (Civil)

62/2006/03, in which the Appellant and the said Walter Fernando were added as

defendants. The Plaintiff–Respondent and MTV Channel (Private) Limited settled

that action on 15/12/2014. However, as the Defendant had made a claim in

reconvention therein, both matters, Case Nos. HC (Civil) 53/2006/03 and HC (Civil)

62/2006/03, were heard simultaneously.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned Commercial High Court Judge delivered

Judgment dated 05/05/2017, in favor of the Plaintiff–Respondent in Case No. HC

(Civil) 53/2006/03. The Defendant’s claim in reconvention in Case No. HC (Civil)

62/2006/03 was dismissed subject to costs. Being aggrieved by the Judgment in Case

No. HC (Civil) 53/2006/03, the Defendant-Appellant has preferred the present

appeal.

1.4. Appeal to the Supreme Court.

In the Petition of Appeal, the Appellant, amongst other grounds, pleaded that the;

- Judgment is contrary to law,

- learned trial Judge erred in analyzing the facts,

- learned trial Judge failed to analyze documents 2V2, 2V3, 2V4, 2V6, 2V7 and

2V7(a), which the Appellant relied upon.

- award of damages was excessive.

- learned trial Judge erred in applying the provisions of the Intellectual Property

Act No. 36 of 2003.

At the outset, I wish to state that the Plaintiff’s evidence-in-chief, which was tendered

by an affidavit marked “X” at the trial on 10/03/2014, together with documents

marked therewith, is not part of the record before this Court.

Page 7 of 23

When the matter was listed before Court for argument on 18/10/2024, the Appellant,

by motion dated 14/10/2024, brought to the notice of Court that the affidavit which

contained the Plaintiff’s evidence-in-chief (marked “X”) together with the documents

marked, was not filed of record, whereupon the Court made order that the said

documents be filed together with the written submissions.

Despite such order, the said affidavit marked “X” was not filed before this Court.

Notwithstanding the aforestated, learned counsel for both parties agreed, as recorded

in the journal entry dated 30/01/2025, that the matter be heard and determined on

the documents available before Court. Accordingly, I proceed based on the evidence

available on record.

1.5. Economic Rights

It is the position of the Plaintiff–Respondent that he is the producer of the film

Parasathumal and, as such, the original owner of economic rights.

He denies that he ever assigned or otherwise divested himself of those rights in favor

of Warnakulasooriya Walter Fernando or any other person. He has consistently

maintained that any permission granted by him from time to time was, at most,

limited to licenses for specified screenings or exhibitions and not a transfer of

ownership.

On that basis, the Plaintiff-Respondent states that the Defendant-Appellants position

on Walter Fernando being a holder of economic rights is misconceived.

The Defendant–Appellant, on the other hand, relies on an entitlement through Walter

Fernando. It is his position that the Plaintiff had, by agreement/assignment,

transferred to Walter Fernando the intellectual property rights in the film, and that

Page 8 of 23

Walter Fernando thereafter sold and transferred the relevant television/broadcasting

rights to the Defendant.

The chain of entitlement pleaded by the Defendant is as follows,

● The document marked 2V1 agreement 23/01/1984, signed between Walter

Fernando as the owner of the movie and the National Film Corporation.

● Agreement marked 2V7 dated 19/07/1997 signed by Walter Fernando and the

Defendant, where Walter Fernando transfers the ‘TELEVISION

TELECASTING RIGHTS, (BROADCASTING T.V.) VIDEO, EXHIBITION

RIGHTS of the said film called “PARASATHU MAL…” to the Defendant.

It is noted that the principal document relied upon by the Defendant to justify the

contention that Walter Fernando was the owner of the film is marked 2V1.

At face value 2V1 is an agreement between Walter Fernando / Nawa Cinema Films

and the National Film Corporation, under which the National Film Corporation agrees

to provide film distribution services (including storage and custody of

prints/negatives, scheduling and dispatching to theatres, inspection,

repair/maintenance, and accounting), in relation to the film listed in the schedule as

“Parasathu Mal / Parasathumal.” Document 2V1 states that “the SUPPLIER is the

owner of 35mm Cinematograph Sound FILM/S” described in the schedule.

The Plaintiff has never contested the contents of 2V1 and, in fact, admitted the same.

However, the Plaintiff’s evidence was that the circumstances surrounding the signing

of 2V1 were different and that the document was intended to have only a limited effect.

He stated that, prior to the execution of 2V1, he had personally informed the National

Film Corporation that he was granting Walter Fernando, whom he described as a close

friend, permission to sign the document marked 2V1. The Plaintiff’s position was that

he conferred upon Walter Fernando only limited rights to broadcast or exhibit the film

Page 9 of 23

in the theatres of the National Film Corporation. This, according to the Plaintiff, was

necessitated by the fact that the copies of the film had been destroyed in a fire at the

Hendala Studio. Thereafter, Walter Fernando is said to have incurred expenses in

bringing down copies of the film from London, copying the negatives, and making

fresh prints. On that limited basis, Walter Fernando was authorized to exploit and/or

broadcast the work only to the extent necessary to recover such expenses, and not by

way of an absolute transfer of the Plaintiff’s economic rights.

As stated in page 195 of the appeal brief:

The next question that arises is whether document 2V1 constitutes sufficient proof for

the transfer of rights by the Plaintiff to Walter Fernando.

The document marked 2V1 was executed on 23/01/1984. The law governing the

transfer of economic rights at the material time is contained in section 10, read with

section 18, of the Code of Intellectual Property Act, No. 52 of 1979.

Page 10 of 23

Section 10.

“Subject to the provisions of sections 12 to 16 the author of a protected work shall

have the exclusive right to do or authorize any other person to do the following acts

in relation to the whole work or a part thereof-

(a) reproduce the work;

(b) make a translation, adaptation, arrangement, or other transformation of the

work;

(c) communicate the work to the public by performance, broadcasting, television or

any other means.”

Section 18.

“(1) The rights referred to in section 10 shall be transferable in whole or in part.

(2) Any transfer, other than by operation of law, of a right referred to in section 10

shall be in writing signed by the transferor.

(3) A transfer, in whole or in part of any right referred to in section 10, shall not

include or be deemed to include the transfer of any other rights referred to

therein.

(4) When a contract provides for the total transfer of one of the rights referred to in

section 10, the scope of such contract shall be limited to the exercise of such rights as

are provided for in the contract.

(5) The transfer of ownership of the only copy or of one or several copies of a work

shall not imply or be deemed to imply the transfer of the copyright in the work.”

(emphasis is mine)

Page 11 of 23

A similar provision is reflected in section 16(2) and (3) of the Intellectual Property

Act No.36 of 2003 as follows:

“(2) Any assignment or transfer of an economic right, and any licence to do such an

act subject to authorization by the owner of the copyright, shall be in writing

signed by the assignor and the assignee, transferor and the transferee or by

the licensor and the licensee, as the case may be.

(3) An assignment or transfer in whole or in part of any economic right, or a licence

to do an act subject to authorization by the owner of copyright, shall not include or

be deemed to include the assignment or transfer or licence in respect of any other

rights not expressly referred to therein.” (emphasis is mine)

Pursuant to the foregoing section, the Act permits the assignment or transfer of

economic rights only by a written instrument signed by the owner and the transferee

and expressly provides that ‘no assignment or licence shall include any rights not

specifically referred to therein’.

In Printcare Group and others v Mudali Peruge Manel Rupa Ranjani

Kulatunga and another [SC (CHC) Appeal No. 05/2013, decided on 17.07.2024],

the Plaintiff-Respondents were the joint authors and original owners of the economic

rights in the Grade 6 Health and Physical Science textbook. They entered into a

written agreement marked ‘Pe1’ with the Defendant-Appellants regarding the printing

and supply of the textbook. Under that agreement, the Plaintiffs agreed to convey the

economic rights to the Defendants, subject to payment of royalties. The Plaintiffs also

consented to those rights being transferred to the Government for publication

purposes. The Defendants were thereafter selected through a tender process to print

and supply the textbook for 2007 and paid the Plaintiffs royalties for that year.

However, when the textbook was reprinted in 2008, the Defendants failed to pay the

Page 12 of 23

agreed royalties. In answer to the Plaintiffs’ claim, they contended that the Plaintiffs

had no subsisting entitlement because the economic rights had been assigned to the

State via the Defendants.

The Supreme Court rejected this argument and held as follows;

“This ‘Pe1’ is not an agreement between the Government and the Plaintiffs but an

agreement between the Defendants and the Plaintiffs. In terms of the Intellectual

Property Act, any transfer, any assignment or licence relating to economic rights

has to be in writing, signed by the transferor and the transferee, assignor and the

assignee or licensor and the licensee as the case may be- vide section 16(2) of the Act.

Even though there is a clear transfer of rights to the Defendants subject to certain

conditions according to the above quoted paragraph, no document made after

entering into ‘Pe1’ that confers such rights to the Government directly by the

Plaintiffs or by the Defendants as per the consent for such purpose included in the

above quoted paragraph has been marked in evidence. It must be noted no one has

placed his signature on ‘Pe1’ on behalf of the Government. Thus, there is no

acceptable proof of transfer of rights to the Government as per the consent expressed

in the quoted paragraph above.”

Turning to document 2V1, as explained before, is an agreement between Walter

Fernando / Nawa Cinema Films and the National Film Corporation for the provision

of film distribution services. It does not constitute a written instrument of transfer

executed by the Plaintiff in favor of Walter Fernando, nor does it expressly convey any

specific economic right, such as television broadcast or communication to the public

as required by section 16(3).

Even if the court is to accept the Plaintiff’s evidence that he personally informed the

National Film Corporation that Walter Fernando had his permission to sign 2V1, such

Page 13 of 23

permission does not amount to a statutory assignment or transfer of economic rights

within the meaning of the previous or the current statute. The IP Act of 1979 is explicit

in requiring that the assignment or transfer of an economic right be carried out by a

written instrument signed by the transferor at a minimum. There is no evidence before

this court that satisfies this requirement.

The question is therefore not whether the Plaintiff consented to Walter Fernando

entering into a distribution arrangement with the National Film Corporation, nor

whether there exist other statements, correspondence or surrounding documents

from which it may be inferred that Walter Fernando was treated as the holder of the

economic rights, but whether there is sufficient proof of a lawful transfer of the

Plaintiff’s economic rights to Walter Fernando in the manner mandated by the Act.

That statutory requirement cannot be fulfilled by implication or by relying on

surrounding conduct. Accordingly, in the present case, the Plaintiff’s consent to

Walter Fernando signing 2V1 cannot, by itself, cure the absence of a written agreement

for the relevant economic rights from the Plaintiff to Walter Fernando, and 2V1 cannot

be treated as sufficient proof of such transfer.

Even apart from the statutory requirements governing the transfer of economic rights

under intellectual property law, such transfer is also subject to the general principles

of contract law, which apply equally to agreements purporting to assign proprietary

interests. A party seeking to rely on a contractual transfer of rights must establish not

only the existence of an agreement, but also that the transferor possessed a valid title

capable of being conveyed. It is a settled principle of law, encapsulated in the maxim

nemo dat quod non habet, that no person can convey a better title than that which he

himself possesses. Accordingly, where the alleged transferor has not lawfully acquired

the relevant rights, any subsequent purported transfer is necessarily ineffective to the

extent of that deficiency.

Page 14 of 23

In the present case, even assuming that Walter Fernando entered into document 2V1

with the National Film Corporation in his own name, the effectiveness of that

agreement depends entirely on whether he had previously acquired a valid title to the

Plaintiff’s economic rights. As already noted, there is no sufficient proof of a lawful

transfer of such rights from the Plaintiff to Walter Fernando in the manner mandated

by statute. In the absence of such a transfer, Walter Fernando could not, in law, convey

ownership of economic rights which he himself did not possess. Therefore, the

Defendant, who claims through or under Walter Fernando, cannot be placed in a

better position than Walter Fernando himself.

1.6. Entitlement to Damages.

Having determined that the Plaintiff–Respondent is the original owner of the

economic rights in the audiovisual work "Parasathumal" and that the Defendant–

Appellant had no lawful authority to exploit those rights, I now turn to the question of

damages, as the Plaintiff–Respondent has argued that the sum awarded by the learned

Commercial High Court Judge is excessive.

The learned High Court Judge awarded damages in the sum of Rs. 1,500,000/-

against the Appellant. The Appellant contends that this award is excessive and

disproportionate to the actual loss suffered by the Plaintiff–Respondent. It is

therefore necessary to examine the principles governing the assessment of damages

in intellectual property infringement cases and to evaluate whether the quantum

awarded can be justified.

Section 170 of the Intellectual Property Act No. 36 of 2003 sets out the remedies

available for infringement of intellectual property rights. The relevant provisions

state:

Page 15 of 23

(1) Where a person to whom any recognized rights granted under this Act, proves to

the satisfaction of the Court that any person is threatening to infringe or has infringed

his rights or is performing acts which makes it likely to infringe a right under this Act,

will occur, the Court may grant an injunction restraining any such person from

commencing or continuing such infringement or performing such acts and may order

damages and such other relief as the Court may deem just and equitable. The

injunction may be granted along with an award of damages and shall not be denied

only for the reason that the applicant is entitled to damages.

(2) --

(3)(a) The court shall have the power to order—

(i) the infringer to pay the right holder such damages as are adequate to

compensate him for the loss suffered by him, by reason of such

infringement, in addition to the recovery of any profits;

(ii)---

(iii)---

(b)---

(4) In making such orders the need for maintaining a balance between the

seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered, as well as the interests

of third parties shall be taken into consideration… (emphasis added)

Therefore, the Court is empowered to award "such other relief as the Court may deem

just and equitable." This confers upon the Court a broad discretion that is not strictly

confined to mathematical calculations of provable loss.

Page 16 of 23

In Sheela Wijewardene v. Sarath Kothalawala and Another [SC CHC Appeal

No. 04/13, decided on 23/05/2025], this Court had to consider the principles

governing the award of damages in intellectual property infringement cases. In that

case, Amarasekara J., citing Lionel Bently and Brad Sherman's text 'Intellectual

Property Law, observed:

"The most common remedy for infringement of intellectual property rights is an

award of damages. The damages recoverable are the same as with other torts: the

aim is to restore the victim to the position he or she would have been in if no

wrong had been committed: it does not aim to punish the defendant." (emphasis

added)

I also wish to reiterate the role of an appellate court in relation to the assessment of

damages. In SC Appeal 68/21 with 69/21 (decided on 05/02/2026), it was observed

that:

“The assessment of such damages is essentially compensatory and lies within the

discretion of the trial judge. An appellate court will interfere with that assessment

only where the trial judge has acted upon a wrong principle, misapprehended

material evidence, or made an award so inordinately high or low as to constitute an

erroneous estimate of the dependants’ loss. In the absence of such error, the appellate

court will not interfere to substitute its own assessment merely because it might have

arrived at a different figure.”

With that in mind, I make the following observations:

The Plaintiff–Respondent has claimed damages in a sum of Rs. 10 million. The

learned Commercial High Court Judge, however, awarded Rs. 1.5 million, on the

reasoning that during the pendency of the action, the Plaintiff–Respondent had

received Rs. 100,000 and Rs. 150,000 from telecasting the film on television channels.

Page 17 of 23

The learned Judge noted that the commercial value of the work during the pendency

of litigation may diminish, as demand may reduce in circumstances where

broadcasting entities are apprehensive of potential legal consequences.

The learned Judge further took the view that, since the Defendant–Appellant had

telecast the film on television, the Plaintiff–Respondent might be unable to profit to

the same extent from exhibiting the work in theatres. As a result, the Plaintiff–

Respondent would be deprived of the full economic benefit of his rights in the work.

Additionally, it was considered that in 2004 the Plaintiff–Respondent had incurred a

cost of Rs. 2 million to remaster the film in Kodak reels, and that the Defendant–

Appellant’s actions had adversely affected the Plaintiff–Respondent’s ability to obtain

a return on that investment.

Before assessing the quantum of damages, it is necessary to address the scope of the

infringement for which damages may be awarded. The Appellant raised the defence

of prescription, contending that any cause of action arising prior to 23/10/2004

(being two years before the institution of the action on 23/10/2006) is prescribed

under Section 9 of the Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871, which provides:

"No action shall be maintainable for any loss, injury, or damage, unless the same

shall be commenced within two years from the time when the cause of action shall

have arisen."

The learned High Court Judge held that each act of infringement gives rise to a fresh

cause of action. Accordingly, whilst any claim for damages arising from alleged

infringements prior to 23/10/2004 would be prescribed, the telecasts that occurred

in 2006 gave rise to fresh causes of action that are not barred by prescription. I do not

wish to depart from that determination of the learned High Court Judge.

Page 18 of 23

The evidence establishes that two specific telecasts are the subject of the Plaintiff's

complaint:

a) the telecast on "Derana" television channel on or about 08/03/2006; and

b) the telecast on "Sirasa" television channel on or about 30/09/2006.

Only these two infringements are subject to damages. Any loss allegedly suffered due

to earlier telecasts or exploitation by the Appellant falls outside the scope of this action

by operation of the law of prescription.

The Appellant has maintained that the film had been exploited by broadcasting it on

television for a considerable period before 2006. He claims that even though the

Plaintiff–Respondent is denying the knowledge of such telecasting, he should have

been aware of such exploitation and did not object for years. On that ground, the

Defendant argues that there had been acquiescence through delay. The Plaintiff–

Respondent denied such knowledge when cross-examined, and the matter remains

contested.

In any event, the documents filed of record by the Appellant, namely the agreement

with MTV marked 2V8 dated 01/09/1998 authorizing the telecast of songs from the

film, and the Invoice marked 2V9 dated 18/08/2004 relating to the cost of the telecast

of the film, clearly demonstrate that arrangements for television exploitation were in

existence well prior to the two telecasts in 2006 which alone are actionable in this

case. In those circumstances, it would not be correct to attribute a broad and

continuing diminution of the commercial value of the work solely to those two

telecasts. As damages are confined to the infringements alleged in 2006, any

substantial award predicated upon a long-term erosion of commercial value would, in

substance, amount to compensation for loss said to have arisen from earlier

exploitation in respect of which no damages can lawfully be awarded.

Page 19 of 23

The Defendant has further contended that the Plaintiff's belated reaction gives rise to

a plea of acquiescence and/or estoppel. Even if the Plaintiff disputes having known

earlier telecasts, the record nevertheless discloses material indicating that, by at least

late 2004, the Plaintiff–Respondent was corresponding regarding telecasts and

permissions, and that such telecasts were broadcast on television networks available

to the public at large.

This consideration is relevant, not for the purpose of extinguishing the cause of action

in respect of the infringements alleged in 2006, which I have already held to constitute

fresh and actionable causes of action, but in determining the proportionality of the

compensation to be awarded. Where it alleges a substantial impairment of commercial

value over time, yet the record discloses either a delayed objection or limited

evidentiary material directed to the quantification of such loss (as discussed in the

succeeding paragraphs), it becomes difficult to justify a substantial award founded

upon assumed or speculative future diminution.

One of the most significant difficulties in determining the quantum of compensation

arises from the absence of cogent evidence as to the magnitude of the damages

claimed. In cross-examination, the Plaintiff–Respondent admitted that he was unable

to explain how the figures of Rs. 10 million and Rs. 5 million pleaded as damages had

been arrived at.

Damages under section 170 must be “adequate to compensate … for the loss

suffered” and must maintain a balance between the seriousness of the infringement

and the remedy ordered. Accordingly, the Court must be cautious to confine any award

to loss that is proved, or can be inferred on sound evidence, as having resulted from

the two actionable telecasts in 2006.

In the specific context of copyright, the Act further directs that the quantum of

damages is to be fixed by taking into account, inter alia, “the importance of the

material and moral prejudice suffered by the owner of the right,” and “the importance

of the infringer’s profits attributable to the infringement.”

The Plaintiff–Respondent has pleaded that the film was remastered in 2004, at a cost

of Rs. 2,000,000/= and subsequent to that, he entered into a contract with Ceylon

Theatres for exhibition in theatres. The quantum of damages requested by the Plaintiff

appears to be based, at least in part, on the proposition that the Plaintiff–

Respondent’s commercial prospects in earning from theater exhibitions were

diminished due to the telecasting on TV. However, the Plaintiff has not, given any

material, either by reference to licence fees which prevailed in the market, lost

exhibition opportunities, audience figures, or other objective criteria to arrive at a

conclusion.

As held earlier, damages must be confined to the two infringements in 2006, namely

the “Derana” telecast on or about 08/03/2006 and the “Sirasa” telecast on or about

30/09/2006.

On the material before Court, the most reliable benchmark for assessing any

“material” loss is the prevailing market value of a telecast licence at the relevant time.

The Plaintiff–Respondent’s own evidence places the estimated earnings per telecast

in the range of Rs. 100,000/- to Rs. 150,000/-.

Page 22 of 23

Proceeding on the upper figure of Rs. 150,000/—being the assumption most

favourable to the Plaintiff–Respondent—the aggregate licence-equivalent value

attributable to two telecasts would be Rs. 300,000/-.

There is also evidence that the connected Action against the MTV Channel was also

settled on 15/12/2014 for Rs. 300,000/-.

Taking all matters into account that,

i. damages must be confined to the two actionable infringements in 2006,

ii. the Plaintiff’s own evidence places the telecast value in the range of Rs.

100,000/- to Rs. 150,000/- per telecast,

iii. the claim for future or consequential loss is not demonstrated by coherent

evidence or computational basis,

iv. compensation had been already received in relation to the “Sirasa” telecast,

v. proportionality is mandated through statute, and the Court must balance the

seriousness of the infringement against the remedy, and

vi. the recognition by statute, which is “material and moral prejudice” and the

infringer’s profits as relevant considerations.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that an award of Rs. 1,500,000/- is excessive

and disproportionate. At the same time, it must be recognised that an infringement of

protected rights did occur, and that the remedy awarded must reflect the seriousness

of an unauthorized public exhibition.

On the material before Court, and bearing in mind that the judicial task is to award a

sum that is “appropriate and just” within a compensatory framework, I would

accordingly set aside the award of Rs. 1,500,000/- and substitute therefor a sum of

Rs. 750,000/- as damages payable by the Defendant–Appellant to the Plaintiff–
