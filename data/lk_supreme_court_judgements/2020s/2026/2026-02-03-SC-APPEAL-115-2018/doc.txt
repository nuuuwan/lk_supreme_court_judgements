The original Plaintiff, now represented by the Substituted-Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as ‘Plaintiff’) filed an action in the District Court of Avissawella

seeking for a declaration that the Plaintiff is the owner of the land and premises described in

the Plaint along with the eviction of the original Defendant (hereinafter referred to as

‘Defendant’) now represented by Substituted-Defendants-Respondents-Appellants, from the

Page 5 of 9

said land and premises. The District Court dismissed the Plaintiff’s action, concluding that

the Defendant had acquired title through prescription. The Court of Appeal, upon an appeal

filed by the said Plaintiff, set aside the judgement of the District Court.

Being aggrieved by the said judgement of the Court of Appeal, the Defendant filed the instant

Application. This Court granted special leave to appeal on the Questions of Law detailed in

paragraphs 22(i) to 22(vi) of the Amended Petition dated 07.02.2017.

In the answer filed in the District Court, the said Defendant divulged about a prior partition

action bearing Case No. 8638. It is admitted that when the decision of the said partition action

was made, the Defendant and her husband resided in the house marked as ‘E’ in Plan No.

1315A (found at page 121 of the brief), situated on the portion of land allocated to the Plaintiff

under the respective partition decree. The contention of the Defendant is that she occupied

the said property continuously since the partition action concluded in 1967. The Defendant

further asserts that the original house marked as ‘E' was entirely demolished by flooding,

prompting her to construct a replacement house on the site, which forms the core subject

matter in the instant Case.

The Plaintiff appears to be the 3rd Defendant in the said partition action, whereas the 7th

Defendant of the said partition action, namely Girigoris, is the husband of the Defendant. It

is acknowledged that the final decree dated 12.02.1965 (found at page 117 of the brief) of the

said partition action mandated a payment of Rs. 350 to the 7th and 15th Defendants. The

Plaintiff maintains that she did not deposit the amount directly with the court but instead

delivered it to an individual named Abdul Latif (the deceased Plaintiff of the said partition

action) to be deposited in court. The Defendant, however, contends that the Plaintiff never

transferred the funds to her husband.

The evidence confirms that neither the Defendant nor her said husband obtained any

allotment from the partition action, but the Defendant maintains that her occupancy of the

premises was under license of the Plaintiff. The District Court, in light of the Defendant's

prolonged residence for more than ten years, on the disputed premises where she later put up

a house, despite the Plaintiff's repeated objections, decided that she had acquired prescriptive

title thereto.

Upon reviewing the pertinent facts and relevant legal principles, the Court of Appeal observed

that the court must address the ensuing questions:

1. Whether the house alleged to have been built by the Defendant can be separated

from the land and if not, whether it goes with the soil.

2. Since Plaintiff's ownership of the land is accepted by the Defendant, can the

Defendant prescribe only to the house?

3. Since the death of her husband, as the Defendant has accepted the position that the

Plaintiff is the owner of the land and premises, is the Defendant estopped from

claiming prescriptive title under Section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance?

4. Whether the Defendant is a bona fide or mala fide improver?

Evidence presented in the Trial Court confirmed that the Defendant acknowledged ownership

of the subject land by the Plaintiff. However, she proceeded to construct a new house in lieu

of the original structure, disregarding the Plaintiff's protests. The Defendant argues that her

ongoing occupancy stems from the Plaintiff's non-payment of Rs. 350 in compensation, as

mandated by the said final partition decree dated 12.02.1965 in Case No. 8638. The Plaintiff

will be formally entitled to apply for a writ of possession once she complies with the said order

to pay compensation.

Under Section 337 of the Civil Procedure Code, any application, whether it be the first or a

subsequent application, for executing a decree (other than one for an injunction) is barred

after 10 years from the date of the decree. The 1980 amendment to this section further

stipulates that an unexecuted writ remains effective for just one year from issuance, in

accordance with Section 337(2). Consequently, the Plaintiff cannot seek enforcement of the

said final partition decree owing to the extensive delay and failure to remit the stipulated

compensation. It is noteworthy that the District Court imposed no deadline for the Plaintiff

to fulfil this payment obligation, nor did the Plaintiff request an extension or renewal of the

decree. Moreover, neither the Defendant nor her husband ever formally pursued the payment

from the Plaintiff, which strengthens the Plaintiff's assertion that the Defendant was in

occupation with the leave and license of the Plaintiff.

The Court of Appeal highlighted a potential counterargument: the destruction of the original

house by flooding would have simultaneously nullified the Defendant's claim to

compensation, since that award was specifically tied to the house prior to floods. Accordingly,

the Court of Appeal decided that the Defendant holds no entitlement to compensation for a

residence lost to floods, which qualify as a natural cause or vis major. On the other hand, the

stand taken by the Defendant in her answer in the District Court is that the Plaintiff is not

entitled to claim rights upon the house put up by the Defendant, as the Plaintiff initiated the

District Court proceedings in respect of the old house, which was destroyed due to floods.

In its judgment, the District Court determined that the Defendant had occupied the disputed

premises since 1977 pursuant to her right of occupation, which the court termed jus retentionis.

Among her submissions, the Defendant asserted that this jus retentionis entitled her to retain

possession until the compensation was disbursed. This raises the issue of whether she qualifies

for compensation regarding the new house. The Court of Appeal noted that, under Roman-

Dutch law, compensation for improvements extends solely to a bona fide improver who

undertook them with the belief or intent of acquiring ownership of the land. The Court of

Appeal cited Sediris v. Dingirimanika 51 NLR 6, wherein it was held that possession exercised

under jus retentionis does not constitute adverse possession and thus cannot support a

prescriptive title.

Another aspect of the arguments advanced by the Defendant, particularly in her answer in

the District Court, without prejudice to her other averments, is that she is entitled to a sum of

Rs.100,000 in compensation should the Plaintiff elect to pay. Nevertheless, the Defendant has

not submitted adequate material in proof of any improvements to the property or the costs

associated with constructing the new house

Similarly, the Defendant's claim under the Rent Act is unsustainable, as she has failed to

maintain a consistent stance on her entitlement to possess the house in question. The facts

and circumstances of this Case demonstrate that the Defendant and her husband occupied

the premises under the leave and license of the Plaintiff. I cannot gather sufficient evidence to

form a contrary opinion other than the position that the Defendant is in occupation of the

premises under the leave and license of the Plaintiff.

The consistent position taken up by the Plaintiff is that the Defendant is not claiming the

prescriptive title to the entire land, but she is claiming prescriptive title only to the subject

house. The Court of Appeal, in view of such argument, observed that:

“Furthermore, when one builds a house on another's land the house goes with the soil.

Since the Defendant has built the house on the land belonging to the Plaintiff, the

house goes to the land with the Plaintiff. Accession was a primary mode of acquisition

of property recognized by the Civil law1. Exceptions were admitted in regard to

movable property for cogent reasons of policy2, but as far as land was concerned, it

was an absolute principle that structures and plantations acceded to the soil and enured

to the benefit of the owner of the soil3.”

In addition to the above, the Court of Appeal decided that the Defendant is a mala fide

improver, thereby disqualifying her from any compensation for the improvements made. The

reason considered by the court for the said conclusion is that the Defendant built the house

disregarding the Plaintiff's explicit objections.

For the foregoing reasons and upon a thorough analysis of the whole evidence led in the

District Court, it is manifest that the Defendant's occupation of the premises has at all material

times been permissive, under the leave and license of the Plaintiff, and cannot be construed

as adverse possession sufficient to found a prescriptive title under the circumstances of this

case. The Defendant's admissions as to the Plaintiff's ownership and her failure to formally

demand or pursue the stipulated compensation within the prescriptive period also need to be

taken into consideration in this regard. I endorse the consideration of the Court of Appeal

upon the absence of any bona fide intent of the Defendant in effecting improvements in

defiance of the Plaintiff's explicit objections and also the applicability of the incontrovertible

principle of accession whereby the house the Defendant constructed acceded to the soil and

enured to the benefit of the Plaintiff. I cannot possibly overlook the phrasing of the relief

sought in the prayer of her answer filed in the District Court whereby she has moved for a

declaration affirming her alleged title exclusively to the subject house while excluding the

appurtenant land. Thus, I hold that the Defendant is precluded from claiming any entitlement

to prescriptive title whether to the land, the house, or otherwise. The Defendant's invocation

of jus retentionis, claims under the Rent Act, or demands for additional compensation are

equally untenable, lacking both evidentiary foundation and legal consistency. Accordingly,

the judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed and the instant Appeal is dismissed. I order

no cost.
