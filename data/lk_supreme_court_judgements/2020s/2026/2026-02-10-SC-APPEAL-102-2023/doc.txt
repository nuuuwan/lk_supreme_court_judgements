Argued on: 24/10/2025

Decided on: 10/02/2026

A. L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

By Plaint dated 21/09/2004, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the “Plaintiff-Appellants”) instituted Action No. D.C. 1843/L

in the District Court of Panadura against the Defendant-Appellant-Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the “Defendant-Respondents”). The Plaintiff-Appellants

sought, inter alia, an order directing the construction of a retention wall or other form

of lateral support along the south-eastern boundary of the Plaintiff-Appellants’ land,

more fully described in the first schedule to the Plaint, to prevent soil erosion,

alternatively, an order directing the Defendant-Respondents to reimburse the costs

incurred by the Plaintiff-Appellants in erecting such a retention wall, and further, a

claim for damages in respect of soil erosion already caused.

In the Plaint, the Plaintiff-Appellants averred that the Defendant-Respondents had

continued to excavate soil along the south-eastern boundary of the Plaintiff-

Appellants’ land, notwithstanding an undertaking allegedly given by them to construct

a parapet or retention wall.

The 1st Defendant-Respondent, and the 2nd and 3rd Defendant-Respondents, by

Answers dated 30/03/2007 and 06/07/ 2007 respectively, denied liability and

disputed the Plaintiff-Appellants’ entitlement to damages. The 4th to 7th Defendant-

Respondents, by Answer dated 19/01/2007, denied responsibility for the alleged soil

erosion and pleaded that, during the period material to the action, they had

transferred their rights in respect of the subject matter to the 1st to 3rd Defendant-

Respondents. They further denied having undertaken or promised, at any time, to

construct a retention wall.

Page 9 of 12

In paragraph 11 of the Answer, the 4th to 7th Defendant-Respondents further stated

that, in any event, a retention wall had been constructed at their own expense and

benefit to cover their portion of the land on the northern boundary.

When the matter was taken up for trial on 11/09/2008, the 2nd and 3rd Defendant-

Respondents were discharged from further proceedings, upon the agreement of the

Plaintiff-Appellants that they would erect a retention wall to the required standard.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge, by Judgment dated

26/06/2014, held, inter alia, that the Defendant-Respondents had failed to construct

a retention wall to mitigate the danger arising from the excavation of soil. The Court

therefore directed the 4th to 7th Defendant-Respondents to construct the remaining

portion of the retention wall and entered Judgment in favor of the Plaintiff-

Appellants.

Being dissatisfied with the said Judgment, the Defendant-Respondents, by Petition of

Appeal dated 07/08/2014, appealed to the High Court of the Western Province

exercising Civil Appellate Jurisdiction holden in Kalutara (“the Appellate Court”). The

Appellate Court, after hearing the parties and considering the issues for

determination, by Judgment dated 15/06/2020, set aside the Judgment of the District

Court and allowed the Appeal with costs.

The Plaintiff-Appellants, thereafter by Petition dated 27/07/2020, invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court seeking to set aside the Judgment of the Appellate Court

dated 15/06/2020.

By Order dated 28/06/2023, this Court granted Leave to Appeal on the following

questions of law:

1. Did the judges of the Civil Appellate High Court fail to consider whether the

Plaintiffs had proved the damages caused to them by the said excavation?

Page 10 of 12

2. In the circumstances, are the 4th – 7C Defendant-Respondents responsible

for causing the same damage?

Thus, the present action is now confined solely to the question of the award of

damages claimed by the Plaintiff-Appellants, arising from the alleged failure of the 4th

to 7th Defendant-Respondents to provide the required lateral support to the Plaintiff-

Appellants’ land.

It is settled law that where excavation is carried out without taking reasonable

precautions, and such excavation causes damage to an adjoining land, liability for

damages may arise based on negligence.

As submitted by the learned President’s Counsel for the Defendant-Respondents, the

evidence placed before the trial court, together with the report of Lal Chandra, a

licensed consultant architect, fails to establish that any soil erosion or damage is

attributable to the acts or omissions of the 4th to 7th Defendant-Respondents.

In Pediris v. Batcha 26 NLR 89, this Court held that liability to pay damages for

withdrawal of lateral support does not arise from the act of excavation per se but only

when that excavation results in actual and ascertainable damage to the adjoining land.

Mere apprehension of damage or the possibility of future soil displacement is

insufficient to support a claim for damages. The right to compensation arises only

upon proof that damage has in fact occurred, whether immediately or subsequently,

as a direct consequence of the withdrawal of lateral support.

In Bandappuhamy v. Swamy Pillai (52 NLR 234), the defendant, who owned a

land adjoining that of the plaintiff, carried out excavations on his own land. The

plaintiff complained that such excavation had removed the natural lateral support of

his land and sought relief on the basis that the excavation had caused, or was likely to

cause, damage to his property. At the time the action was instituted, however, no

actual damage to the plaintiff’s land had been proved. The issue before Court was

Page 11 of 12

whether a cause of action arose merely upon the act of excavation or likely danger, or

only upon the occurrence of actual damage from the withdrawal of lateral support.

It was held that “the damage that could be claimed should be restricted to what was

incurred by, and naturally flowed from, the subsidence of soil which actually resulted

from the excavations. Plaintiff was not entitled to claim the cost of putting up a

retaining wall to prevent further damage.”

Backhouse v. Bonomi (1859) 9 H. L. Cas. 503 affirmed the principle that, in cases

of withdrawal of lateral support, the cause of action arises only upon the occurrence

of actual damage, and not at the time of excavation, and that liability is determined by

the harmful consequences flowing from the act, rather than by the mere act of

excavation itself.

Accordingly, in the absence of proof of existing damage, no liability can arise in respect

of speculative or future harm. It is incumbent upon the Plaintiff-Appellants to

establish that the Defendant-Respondents caused the damage complained of,

rendering them liable in damages.

According to the testimony of witness Lal Chandra, no damage has been caused to the

Plaintiff-Appellants’ land as a result of the alleged excavation. Lal Chandras’ evidence

has been duly considered by the Appellate Court, which correctly reasoned that the

Plaintiff-Appellants had failed to prove any damage caused by the excavation and that,

consequently, the action could not succeed.

The Appellate Court further held that:

“It is clear from the evidence adduced in this case that the 4th to 7th Defendants have

already constructed a retaining wall covering their portion of land, and that the only

area which requires construction as part of a retaining wall is the portion of land

belonging to the 1st Defendant. […]”

I find no reason to disagree with the findings of the Appellate Court. Accordingly,

questions of law Nos. 1 and 2 are answered in the negative.

For the foregoing reasons, the impugned Judgment dated 15/06/2020, delivered by

the Civil Appellate High Court, is affirmed.

The Appeal is dismissed. I make no order as to costs.
