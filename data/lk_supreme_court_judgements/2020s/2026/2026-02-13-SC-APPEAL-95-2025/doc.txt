Decided on: 13.02.2026

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent)

filed this application against the respondent-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the appellant) on 22.07.2021 in the Commercial High

Court, in terms of section 31(1) of the Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995,

seeking enforcement of the arbitral award marked G.

The appellant had entered into a lease agreement marked B with the

respondent and obtained on lease a motor lorry on the terms and

conditions set out therein. The respondent referred the dispute to

arbitration in terms of the arbitration clause in the lease agreement,

alleging, inter alia, that the appellant had violated the agreement by

failing to pay lease rentals and by failing to hand over the lorry upon

termination of the agreement.

In addition to documents marked G and B, the respondent tendered the

following documents along with the application:

3

SC/APPEAL/95/2025

A – Certificate of incorporation of the respondent

C, C1 and C2 – Notice of reference to arbitration and proof of

service on the appellant by registered post

D, D1 and D2 – Notice issued by the arbitrator and proof of service

on the appellant by registered post

E1, E2, E3, F1, F2 and F3 – Notices issued by the arbitration

centre informing the next dates of hearing, together with proof of

service on the appellant by registered post

G1, G2 and G3 – Proof of service of a copy of the arbitral award on

the appellant by registered post

Upon the filing of the application for enforcement, the Commercial High

Court issued notice on the appellant together with copies of the

application and annexures. Notice was served through the Fiscal on

26.01.2022. The appellant thereafter filed objections in terms of section

40(2) of the Arbitration Act on 25.01.2023.

In his objections, the appellant sought dismissal of the respondent’s

application primarily on two grounds:

(a) that the lease agreement marked B was a nullity, as he had signed

it without knowledge of its terms; and

(b) that he was unaware of the arbitration proceedings and had not

received any notices sent by registered post.

Both parties thereafter filed written submissions.

The learned Judge of the Commercial High Court delivered judgment in

open Court on 13.07.2023. Learned Counsel for the appellant admitted

before this Court that the judgment was delivered in the presence of both

Attorneys, allowing the respondent’s application for enforcement of the

arbitral award.

SC/APPEAL/95/2025

The issue before this Court arises in the following manner. The appellant

applied for a certified copy of the judgment on 17.07.2023, upon

payment of the requisite fee, as evidenced by P1(a), and obtained it on

the same date. This certified copy of the judgment has been marked P1.

Judgment P1 records that the appellant was absent and unrepresented

in Court.

Thereafter, on 25.07.2023, the appellant applied for a certified copy of

the entire case record, as evidenced by P3(a), in order to prefer an appeal.

The certified copy of the case record was issued on 27.07.2023. In that

record, the appellant discovered another judgment of the same date,

which was different from P1, and which proceeds on the basis that the

appellant was represented in Court. This judgment has been marked P2.

Judgment P1 did not appear in the certified copy of the case record.

Although the ultimate conclusion in both judgments is the same, the

reasons contained therein materially differ. The learned High Court

Judge has made no reference in P2 to the earlier judgment marked P1.

The appellant filed this appeal seeking leave to appeal in terms of section

37(2) of the Arbitration Act on the following questions of law:

(a) Did the learned High Court Judge err in delivering the ex parte

judgment marked P1?

(b) Did the learned High Court Judge err in stating in the said

judgment that there was no legal representation on behalf of the

appellant?

(c) Did the learned High Court Judge err in delivering two judgments

marked P1 and P2 on the same date?

This Court granted leave to appeal on the aforesaid questions of law.

At the argument, this Court also raised the following additional questions

of law:

5

SC/APPEAL/95/2025

(d) Did the respondent-appellant make an application before the

Commercial High Court in terms of the provisions of the

Arbitration Act?

(e) If the answer to (d) is in the negative, should the application of the

respondent-appellant to the High Court have been dismissed in

limine?

(f) Even assuming that the Commercial High Court pronounced two

judgments on the same date, has that fact caused prejudice to the

substantive rights of the appellant?

It is a fundamental principle that once a judgment is pronounced, the

judge becomes functus officio. Although this rule admits of certain limited

exceptions, none of those exceptions are applicable to the present case.

The learned High Court Judge did not purport to act within any

recognised exception. Instead, the record reveals that the first judgment

marked P1 was deliberately replaced by the second judgment marked P2,

without reference to or acknowledgment of the former. Such conduct is

wholly impermissible.

Where an appellant has been issued with certified copies of two different

judgments of the same date, the appellant is left in a state of uncertainty

as to which judgment prevails. This situation causes grave prejudice to

the appellant’s right to pursue a proper appeal before this Court.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer the questions of law as follows:

(a) Yes.

(b) Yes.

(c) Yes.

(d) The appellant did not make an application to set aside the award

under section 32 of the Arbitration Act, but filed objections as

permitted under section 40(2) of the Act.

(e) The objections could not have been dismissed in limine.

(f) Yes.

6

SC/APPEAL/95/2025

Accordingly, both judgments marked P1 and P2 are set aside. The

incumbent High Court Judge of the Commercial High Court is directed

to deliver judgment afresh on the basis of the material already available

on record.

Judge of the Supreme Court

K. Priyantha Fernando, J.

I agree.
