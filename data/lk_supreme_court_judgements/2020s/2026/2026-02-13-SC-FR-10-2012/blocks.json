    "text": "The application has arisen out of a tender called by the Central Cultural Fund (CCF) for the printing of tourist entrance tickets for Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa, and Anuradhapura. On 16.09.2011, the CCF published an advertisement (P6 \u2013 newspaper advertisement) in the Daily News calling for quotations, setting out requirements such as the design of attractive tourist tickets, preparation of a mini documentary DVD of at least three minutes for each site in three languages, and the introduction of a barcode system. Approximately 200,000 tickets were required annually, and quotations were to be submitted by 30.09.2011. Pursuant to this notice, the Petitioner, who carries on business under the name of D.P.J. Holdings (DPJH), submitted a quotation (P7 \u2013 quotation) dated 30.09.2011 which contained two pricing options Rs. 3.90 and Rs. 4.90 per ticket, and a DVD cost of Rs. 60. A bid bond of Rs. 5,000 was also duly paid to the CCF as required by the advertisement. The Petitioner emphasizes that DPJH is an established business with experience in barcode systems, printing, and process automation, having undertaken many government and private contracts previously, and is therefore well qualified to undertake this work.",

On 28.10.2011,(P12 \u2013 DPJH letter) in view of the extension given by the CCF, DPJH withdrew the earlier sample and submitted new samples covering all three sites along with tickets under Option 1. These DVDs were in Sinhala, English, French, and German, ranging from 6\u201312 minutes in length, well above the minimum three-minute requirement. The entrance tickets and DVDs submitted are annexed as P13A\u2013C and P14A\u2013D.

The 5th Respondent also argues that it is a partnership, not a legal entity capable of being sued in its own name, making the Petition defective on this ground as well. It further states that it complied fully with the tender requirements submitting samples and DVDs through letters 5R1, 5R2 and 5R3 and demonstrated technologically superior tickets when requested (supported by 5R5, 5R6 and 5R7), while the Petitioner\u2019s own samples showed shortcomings. The 5th Respondent denies the Petitioner\u2019s allegation that it lacks barcoding or printing capability, noting that the tender did not require the bidder to personally own such facilities and that it had already arranged these services through agreements such as 5R10. On these grounds non-joinder, improper parties, compliance with tender requirements, and lack of factual basis the 5th Respondent requests dismissal of the Petition at the threshold.",

The petitioner complains that the Central Cultural Fund, by the tender board, acted arbitrarily and in breach of Article 12(1) when it awarded the printing contract to the 5th respondent and rejected the petitioner\u2019s bid. The core of the petitioner\u2019s case rests upon three related strands: first, that the decision was taken without proper, impartial evaluation; second, that the petitioner was not informed or given reasons for rejection; and third, that the process was used to rubber-stamp a pre-determined selection of the 5th respondent. The respondents, particularly in the written submission of the 2nd respondent and the statement of objections of the 1st, 3rd and 4th respondents, have emphasised that the tender board acted on technical and qualitative grounds. They rely on the technical evaluation report (P16(b)/Technical Report), the demonstration of samples, and the experience and documentary ownership claimed by the 5th respondent. The 2nd respondent\u2019s written submission goes through the tender procedure in detail and contends that price was not the dominant factor; quality, language compatibility, content ownership and feasibility were legitimate qualities to favour the 5th respondent.",

In examining the scope of Article 12(1), it is necessary to note the classical approach adopted by this Court in earlier decisions. In Perera v Jayawickrama [1985] 1 SLR 285, a Full Bench of this Court held that Article 12(1) is violated where there is unequal treatment of persons who are similarly circumstanced, and that differentiation is permissible only where it is founded upon a rational and reasonable basis relevant to the subject matter. Sharvananda, C.J. observed that the guarantee of equality does not prohibit classification as such, but only discrimination that is arbitrary or prejudicial when compared with the treatment of others in similar circumstances.

The jurisprudence referred to before this Court emphasizes that reasons are not a mere formality; they are indispensable where public funds are involved and where the decision has a direct impact on individual rights. In Karunadasa v. Unique Gemstones Ltd 1997(1) SLR 256, this Court considered the importance of providing reasons in decision-making concerning public or private rights. The Court identified two fundamental aspects of the right to receive reasons. The first is the right of the individual affected by a decision to know why an adverse determination has been made, thereby enabling the person to challenge the decision if justified. The second is the right of the Court to be informed of the reasons, so that meaningful judicial review can take place. Where a party is denied the reasons for a decision, such omission constitutes a breach of the rules of natural justice. Similarly, if the Court is not given reasons, the decision may be set aside on the ground that it is arbitrary or unreasonable. Here, the petitioner claims neither was done. Neither the petitioner nor this Court has been provided with a clear explanation of how subjective factors such as \u201cattractiveness\u201d or \u201ccreativity\u201d were measured, how the language-compatibility requirement was tested, or why ownership doubts (raised at 16.10.2011 by the technical committee in relation to the 5th respondent\u2019s CD) were not treated as disqualifying.

It is also alleged, and has not been adequately explained, that the same Board later made an award which increased the number of tickets to be printed from 200,000 to 500,000, well beyond what was stated in the call for tenders. These facts support the Petitioner\u2019s concern that the tender process may not have been genuinely competitive.

In Jayasinghe v Attorney General [1994] 2 SLR 74, Mark Fernando J. held that the Court is entitled to take judicial notice of the fact that fundamental requirements of justice and fair play ordinarily demand disclosure of reasons. His Lordship cautioned against treating earlier decisions as laying down inflexible rules and stressed that the facts of each case must be examined to determine whether the conduct complained of offends constitutional guarantees. Applying this principle to the present case, the failure to notify, the failure to give reasons, and the failure to account to the Court together establish a denial of fairness sufficient to attract the protection of Article 12(1). In Karunadasa v. Unique Gemstones Ltd 1997(1) SLR 256 at page 263 paragraph 3 it is stated clearly that natural justice requires more than simply hearing and recording a party\u2019s",
