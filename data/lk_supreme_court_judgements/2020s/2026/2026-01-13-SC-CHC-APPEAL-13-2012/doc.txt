SC/CHC/APPEAL/13/2012

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner-appellant filed this appeal against the judgment of the

Commercial High Court dated 11.11.2011. Before the appeal was taken up

for argument, the appellant passed away. The appellant’s daughter, Abeer

Talib Tawfiq Al-Nakib, filed an application seeking that she be substituted

in his place for the purpose of prosecuting this appeal. The 1ˢᵗ to 3ʳᵈ

respondents objected to the said application. Learned President’s Counsel

appearing for both parties agreed that the matter be disposed of by way of

written submissions. Hence this order.

One of the grounds on which she sought to be substituted is that her father

left a last will bequeathing all his properties to her, and that proceedings

have been instituted in the District Court to prove the said last will.

In the written submissions, learned President’s Counsel for the 1ˢᵗ to 3ʳᵈ

defendants states that the other three children of the deceased plaintiff have

been made respondents in the said action, and that the present application

for substitution is premature, as there is no finality with regard to the estate

of the deceased plaintiff. He further states that a Court in Kuwait has held

that the said last will cannot be enforced under Islamic law. It is further

submitted that the party seeking to be substituted is neither a legal

representative of the deceased plaintiff nor has she demonstrated that she

is a fit and proper person to be substituted in place of the deceased plaintiff.

Learned President’s Counsel finally submits that, if all four children are

substituted in place of the deceased plaintiff, the 1ˢᵗ to 3ʳᵈ defendants would

have no objection to the application for substitution.

Substitution in the District Court is principally governed by Chapter XXV

of the Civil Procedure Code, comprising sections 392 to 404. The Civil

Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 8 of 2017 simplified the previously

complex procedure relating to substitution by repealing sections 393 to 398

4

SC/CHC/APPEAL/13/2012

of the principal enactment and replacing them with new provisions, while

also amending section 27. A salient feature of this amendment is the

introduction of a mandatory requirement that each party file a

memorandum nominating not less than one and not more than three

persons as his legal representatives for the purpose of proceeding with the

action in the event of his death prior to its final determination. Where such

a memorandum has not been filed, the procedure stipulated in the said

Chapter must be followed for substitution.

The legislature has also introduced special provisions to simplify the

procedure relating to substitution in partition actions by repealing and

replacing section 81 of the Partition Law through the Partition (Amendment)

Act No. 17 of 1997.

Strict adherence to these provisions by District Judges would substantially

reduce the time and judicial resources presently expended on substitution

proceedings.

Substitution in proceedings before the Court of Appeal is governed by

section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code, which empowers the Court to

make appropriate orders to ensure the continuation of the appeal upon the

death of a party.

760A. Where at any time after the lodging of an appeal in any civil

action, proceeding or matter, the record becomes defective by reason of

the death or change of status of a party to the appeal, the Court of

Appeal may in the manner provided in the rules made by the Supreme

Court for that purpose, determine who, in the opinion of the court, is

the proper person to be substituted or entered on the record in place of,

or in addition to, the party who has died or undergone a change of

status, and the name of such person shall thereupon be deemed to be

substituted or entered of record as aforesaid.

5

SC/CHC/APPEAL/13/2012

Unlike proceedings before the District Court, where substitution is governed

by several provisions of the Civil Procedure Code applicable at different

stages, section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code vests the Court of Appeal

with wide discretion to determine who, in the opinion of the Court, is the

“proper person” to be substituted. Section 760A does not even prescribe the

mode by which an application for substitution should be made. The inquiry

undertaken in determining the “proper person” under section 760A, for the

limited purpose of prosecuting the remaining part of the appeal, is directed

at ensuring the continuation of the appeal despite the death or change in

status of a party, and not at adjudicating upon the substantive rights of the

parties concerned. This position has been recognised in Careem v.

Sivasubramaniam [2003] 2 Sri LR 197, Chandana Hewavitharane v. Urban

Development Authority [2005] 2 Sri LR 107, and Kusumawathie v. Kanthi

[2004] 1 Sri LR 350.

Substitution in proceedings before the Supreme Court is governed by Rule

38 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990.

38. Where at any time after the lodging of an application for special

leave to appeal, or an application under Article 126, or a notice of

appeal, or the grant of special leave to appeal, or the grant of leave to

appeal by the Court of Appeal, the record becomes defective by reason

of the death or change of status of a party to the proceedings, the

Supreme Court may, on application in that behalf made by any person

interested, or ex mero motu, require such applicant or the petitioner or

appellant, as the case may be, to place before the court sufficient

materials to establish who is the proper person to be substituted or

entered on the record in place of, or in addition to, the party who has

died or undergone a change of status;

Provided that where the party who has died or undergone a change of

status is the petitioner or appellant, as the case may be the court may

6

SC/CHC/APPEAL/13/2012

require such applicant or any party to place such material before the

court.

The court shall thereafter determine who shall be substituted or added,

and the name of such person shall thereupon be substituted or added,

and entered on the record as aforesaid. Nothing hereinbefore contained

shall prevent the Supreme Court itself ex mero motu, where it thinks

necessary, from directing the substitution or addition of the person who

appears to the court to be the proper person therefor.

An application for substitution may be made “by any person interested”,

and not necessarily by a legal representative or next of kin who has adiated

the inheritance of the deceased. Upon “sufficient material” being placed

before the Court, it is for the Court to determine who is the “proper person”

to be substituted. The Court may also, ex mero motu, direct the substitution

of a “person who appears to the Court to be the proper person therefor.”

When it comes to substitution in appellate proceedings, the Court is not

fettered by technicalities. This is because substitution does not confer upon

the person substituted the status of a legal heir of the deceased party. It is

therefore not necessary to substitute all heirs of the deceased as parties to

the appeal. As I have already stated, substitution is solely for the limited

purpose of prosecuting the appeal. Consequently, devoting excessive

judicial time to substitution proceedings is unwarranted, unless the Court

is of the view that the application for substitution is mala fide. This position

has been consistently recognised in Seelawathie v. Sumanawathie

(SC/APPEAL/199/2014, SC Minutes of 22.06.2017), Edandukitha

Gnanasiri Thero v. Dellawa Suneetha Thero (SC/HCCA/LA/378/2017, SC

Minutes of 08.03.2022), and Ven. Aludeniye Subodhi Thero v. Ven. Kotapola

Amarakiththi Thero (SC/APPEAL/144/2019, SC Minutes of 31.10.2023).

SC/CHC/APPEAL/13/2012

In the instant case, although the 1st to 3rd defendants state that they have

no objection for substitution being effected provided all four children of the

deceased plaintiff are substituted, no such application has been made or

affidavits tendered by those three children to that effect. There is also no

necessity to await the conclusion of the testamentary proceedings, as

substitution does not confer upon the person substituted the status of a

legal heir of the deceased party.

Taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I overrule the objection

of the 1st to 3rd defendants and hold that Abeer Tawfiq Al Nakib is a proper

person to be substituted in place of the deceased plaintiff for the purpose of

prosecuting this appeal. The costs of this inquiry will abide the final

outcome of the appeal.
