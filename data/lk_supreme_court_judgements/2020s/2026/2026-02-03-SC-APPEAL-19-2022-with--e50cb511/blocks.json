The first issue to be determined is therefore whether the Appellant was in fact a permanent employee at the time of termination. This question is central, for the legal protections available to an employee depend on that status. A permanent employee enjoys a higher degree of security of tenure and cannot be dismissed except for just cause, established by cogent evidence and in accordance with due process. Conversely, a probationer does not yet enjoy those protections, and the employer retains a wider discretion to terminate, though still subject to principles of fairness and non-discrimination.",

In consequence, she continued to serve as a probationer, and her services were lawfully terminated upon an objective assessment of suitability. The documentary and oral evidence demonstrate that the Respondent, having afforded the Appellant repeated opportunities to improve and issued several warnings regarding her poor performance, attendance, and lack of cooperation, was entitled in law to form the view that she was unsuitable for confirmation.

The documentary and oral evidence demonstrated that the Respondent consistently communicated performance expectations, provided reminders, issued letters detailing deficiencies, and offered opportunities to improve. The correspondence and performance assessments, including R1, R2, R4, R5, R6, and R7, show a genuine concern for the Appellant\u2019s development rather than any intent to punish or victimise. Additionally, the Appellant\u2019s own admissions in cross-examination confirmed that she was aware of her shortcomings and the need to comply with departmental instructions. In light of these facts, there is no indication of bad faith on the part of the employer; the termination was a bona fide exercise of managerial discretion consistent with the Appellant\u2019s probationary status.",
