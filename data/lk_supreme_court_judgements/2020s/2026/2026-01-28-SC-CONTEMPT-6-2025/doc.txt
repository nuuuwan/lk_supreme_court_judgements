Samayawardhena, J.

This matter is connected to Case No. SC/APPEAL/248/2025, in which

judgment was delivered today. The dispute arises from the award of a

tender.

The complainant in these contempt proceedings, Hayleys Lifesciences (Pvt)

Ltd, was the unsuccessful bidder. The parties against whom contempt

proceedings have been initiated are the successful bidder, Mervynsons (Pvt)

Ltd, its Project Manager, and its directors.

The complaint is that, when Mervynsons (Pvt) Ltd filed the leave to appeal

application before this court, challenging the order of the Court of Appeal

dated 03.04.2025, paragraph 73 of the supporting affidavit sworn by the

Project Manager of the said company contained a false statement. It is

alleged that, on that basis, the said officer of the company and its directors

are liable for contempt of court within the meaning of the Contempt of a

Court, Tribunal or Institution Act, No. 8 of 2024.

Paragraph 73 of the affidavit filed by the Project Manager of the said

company reads as follows:

I state that by end of December 2024, they had installed the Lithotripter

system at the Kandy National Hospital and handed over the same to

the state authorities. However, the commissioning of the system was

4

SC/CONTEMPT/6/2025

postponed in compliance with the undertaking previously furnished by

the learned Senior State Counsel, as referred to hereinabove.

The contention of the complainant is that the lithotripter system supplied

by Mervynsons (Pvt) Ltd had been handed over to the Ministry of Health but

had not been installed at the National Hospital of Kandy. It is asserted that

the statement to the effect that the system had been installed at the National

Hospital of Kandy is incorrect, and that this alleged falsehood gives rise to

contempt of court.

The affidavit in question consists of eighty-six paragraphs. It is common

ground that paragraph 73 alone is impugned, and that no other averment

contained in the affidavit is alleged to be false or to amount to contempt of

court.

Paragraph 73, when read in isolation, lacks clarity. When the affirmant

states, “I state that by end of December 2024, they had installed the

lithotripter system at the Kandy National Hospital and handed over the same

to the state authorities”, it is not clear as to whom the expression “they”

refers, nor is it clear who is said to have carried out the installation.

Further, ambiguity arises when the affirmant states that the lithotripter

system was installed and then states that the lithotripter system was

handed over to the state authorities. It is unclear whether the term “state

authorities” refers to the National Hospital of Kandy, or to the Ministry of

Health in Colombo.

The lack of clarity is compounded by the contents of the immediately

preceding paragraph, namely paragraph 72, in which the affirmant states

that the complainant filed the writ application with a view to impeding the

installation process at the National Hospital of Kandy. This averment gives

rise to the impression that, at the time the writ application was filed, the

lithotripter system was yet to be installed. It is also relevant to note that

5

SC/CONTEMPT/6/2025

there is no allegation that Mervynsons (Pvt) Ltd proceeded to install the

system after the filing of the writ application.

Such ambiguity assumes particular importance in contempt proceedings. A

charge of contempt founded on an allegedly false statement requires the

impugned averment to be clear, unequivocal, and demonstrably false.

Where the language employed is imprecise, internally inconsistent, or

reasonably capable of more than one interpretation, it becomes unsafe to

readily characterise the statement as a deliberate falsehood made with the

intention of misleading court.

Taking all these matters into consideration, together with the findings and

the final conclusion reached in the main case, SC/APPEAL/248/2025, I am

not persuaded that the Project Manager of Mervynsons (Pvt) Ltd made a

false statement “with intent to cause grave prejudice to the judicial process

in relation to any ongoing litigation” as contemplated in section 3(1)(b) of the

Contempt of a Court, Tribunal or Institution Act.

As I observed in Virgina Perera v. M.B.A. Systems (Pvt) Ltd and Others

(SC/CHC/APPEAL/18/2018, SC Minutes dated 23.07.2025), the exercise

of the contempt jurisdiction is not intended for the glorification of the court.

Its purpose is to safeguard the dignity and authority of the judicial office,

without which public confidence in the administration of justice cannot be

sustained. It must also be recognised that public confidence in the

administration of justice is undermined not only by condoning unlawful

intrusions upon the authority of court, but equally by permitting the

contempt jurisdiction to be misused in furtherance of ulterior motives of

litigants. Contempt of court is an offence against the court itself and not

against any individual party. It is a jurisdiction to be exercised with great

circumspection.

SC/CONTEMPT/6/2025

In the circumstances, I decline to issue a Rule on the alleged accused party

to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt of court.

The application is dismissed.
