SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J

COUNSEL: Uditha Egalahewa, PC with Amaranath Fernando instructed by Lilanthi

Nirmalan Wigneswaran, DSG for Respondent-Respondents

WRITTEN

SUBMISSIONS:

Respondent-Respondents on 6th July 2015 and 07th May 2025

Petitioner-Appellant 7th July 2015 and 28th April 2025

ARGUED ON: 28th March 2025

DECIDED ON: 22nd January 2026

THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The instant appeal arises out of a writ application filed by the Petitioner-Appellant

[hereinafter ‘Appellant’] before the Court of Appeal seeking, inter alia, the following relief:

a. “A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 4th Respondent-Respondent,

contained in P13(b) rejecting the Petitioner’s appeal for the promotion to the post

of Professor;1

b. A Writ of Mandamus directing the 3rd – 33rd Respondent-Respondents to appoint the

Petitioner to the post of Professor, with effect from 14.07.2008.”

1 The ‘appeal’ referred to herein is an appeal to the Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo dated 5th April 2011. This letter of appeal is marked P13(a) in the Petitioner-Appellant’s Petition before the Court of Appeal, whereas the P13(b) is the letter dated 20th October 2011 by which the Petitioner-Appellant was informed of the rejection of the said appeal

SC Appeal 05/2015 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 31

2. By judgment dated 27th June 2014, the Court of Appeal dismissed the application of the

Petitioner-Appellant. Aggrieved by the said judgment, the Appellant filed a Special Leave

to Appeal Application before this Court, and on 13th January 2015, this Court granted

special leave to appeal on three questions of law set out in paragraphs 13(a), 13(c) and

13(d) of the said Petitioner of Appeal.

3. I must place on record that the Appellant was, in fact, promoted to the post of Professor

while this matter was pending before this Court. However, this does not render the instant

case futile, as the judgment of this Court would determine whether her appointment to

the post of Professor ought to be backdated or not. While this matter was pending before

this Court, various attempts were made to resolve this matter administratively. Failing at

which, the Court proceeded to fix this matter for judgment.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE APPEAL

Background of the Case and the Applicable Scheme of Recruitment

4. The Appellant, presently a Professor in the Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine,

University of Colombo, was an Associate Professor at the time of filing her application

before the Court of Appeal. The Appellant’s writ application relates to grievances

associated with the very same application process which led to her promotion as an

Associate Professor.

5. Circular No. 723 dated 12th December 1997 issued by the University Grants Commission

[Marked “P4”] contains the scheme of recruitment for the posts of Associate Professor,

Professor and Senior Professor in the University System. Although a different scheme of

recruitment is in operation today, the said Circular is the scheme applicable to the

Appellant, who was seeking a merit promotion. This has not been disputed.

6. According to Item 14 of the said Circular, the application and the marking scheme for the

SC Appeal 05/2015 JUDGMENT Page 23 of 31

selections consists of four sections: Contribution to Teaching and Academic Development

(Section 1); Research and Creative Work (Section 2); Dissemination of Knowledge (Section

3.1) and University and National Development Activities (Section 3.2). A Senior Lecturer

may be considered for promotion if such a lecturer obtains the required minimum mark

under the said criteria. Naturally, the minimum mark threshold to be considered for the

grade of Professor is higher than that which is set for the grade of Associate Professor.

7. Under the applicable scheme, the applications of a candidate consist of a self-assessment

of the candidate under each of the abovementioned four sections. Following the

submission of such a self-assessment with the application, the same is to be evaluated by

two panels appointed by the Senate. Evaluation of Sections 1 and 3.2 is carried out by a

panel headed by the Vice Chancellor/Dean of the Faculty to which an applicant belongs

and two other Professors of the University appointed by the Senate. Evaluation of Sections

2 and 3.1 is carried out by a panel of two experts from outside the University, and the said

panel, too, is to be appointed by the Senate. Following these evaluations, the final

selection is to be made by the Selection Committee based on the reports from said

evaluations.

8. As the learned Deputy Solicitor General highlighted, the scheme of recruitment requires

such initial evaluations of a candidate’s application to be submitted to the Selection

Committee, which is responsible for the final selection. Evaluation panels do not select

candidates but rather conduct an evaluation of the self-assessed applications made by

such candidates.

9. On 14th July 2008, while the Appellant was serving at the University as a Senior Lecturer,

she had made an application [marked ‘P7’] seeking promotion to the post of “Associate

Professorship/Professorship” at the University of Colombo. Pursuant to this application,

she had attended an in-person interview on 07th October 2010.

SC Appeal 05/2015 JUDGMENT Page 24 of 31

The Contentious Aspect of the Promotion Application

10. On 08th October 2010, the Appellant had been informed that the Selection Committee,

which makes the final selection under the applicable scheme of recruitment, had deducted

certain marks allocated to her by the external evaluators—which the Appellant alleges to

be ultra vires and illegal. This deduction had resulted in the Appellant being promoted to

the post of Associate Professor instead of Professor.

11. The Petitioner had been informed of her promotion to the post of Associate Professor

with effect from 14th July 2008 by letter dated 24th January 2011 [Maked “P12”], and the

Appellant had accepted the said promotion by letter of acceptance dated 2nd February

2011. However, she had, thereafter, by letter dated 05th April 2011 [Marked “P13(a)”],

lodged an appeal to the Vice Chancellor of the University against the said deductions,

which was rejected by letter dated 20th October 2011 [Marked “P13(b)”].

12. It is against the decision reflected in this letter marked “P13(b)” that the Appellant has

sought relief in the nature of writs of certiorari and mandamus. As the Respondents

highlight, the Appellant has not sought to quash the selection made by the Selection

Committee nor the decision of the said Selection Committee to deduct marks from her

application. Under these circumstances, the Respondents contended that the relief sought

by the Appellant was futile.

13. In any event, the record indicates that the Selection Committee has effected two separate

mark deductions in the Appellant’s application. One such deduction has been to correct

an arithmetic error. The Appellant has not challenged this deduction in her writ

application before the Court of Appeal.

14. The other deduction—which the Appellant seeks to challenge—relates to two items the

Appellant has cited under Section 3.1.2 in her self-assessment. Under this particular

SC Appeal 05/2015 JUDGMENT Page 25 of 31

section, a candidate can cite books written by them that are to be used for supplementary

reading, whereas Section 3.1.1 and Section 3.1.3 refer to textbooks and translations of

books, respectively. While an applicant is able to cite however many books written by

them under this Section 3.1.2 and claim 4 marks for each such book, in cases of joint

authorship, marks are to be assigned according to the applicant’s contribution.

15. The Appellant in her self-assessment has claimed 4 marks each, and 8 marks in total, citing

the following two items as books under the aforementioned Section 3.1.2:

a. “3.1.2.1 – Manual on Determination of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, compiled by

Dr. Mangala Gunatilaka, Dr. Arundathi Kurukulasuriya, Dr. Kusum de Abrew”;

[Marked “R2”] and

b. “3.1.2.2. – Manual on Measurement of Whole-blood coagulation time, compiled by

Dr. Mangala Gunatilaka, Dr. Arundathi Kurukulasuriya.” [Marked “R3”]

16. The two External Evaluators had also given 8 marks and 7.6 marks, respectively, for the

two items. However, the Selection Committee had deducted these 7.6 marks after

examining the two items at the meeting held on 07th October 2010 on the basis that “R2”

and “R3” cannot be considered as “books”.

17. The reasoning of the Selection Committee has been recorded as follows in the document

marked “R6”:

“The Section Panel having gone through marks given for selections, decided that no

marks should be given to Section 3.1.2 – reason – the submissions are practical

manuals for a single practical and not books”

18. As the Respondent highlighted, the Appellant had claimed 2 marks each for the very same

items under Section 2.14.2 for “Other Creative Work”. The Court observes this assertion

SC Appeal 05/2015 JUDGMENT Page 26 of 31

to be correct, as can be clearly seen on Section 2: Page 16 [Case Brief, p. 150] of the

Appellant’s application.

19. In addition to this, the Respondents also highlighted that the Appellant herself has

identified these items as “manuals” that were jointly “compiled” by her with many others.

Moreover, learned Deputy Solicitor General strenuously argued that these works,

consisting of merely 10 and 21 pages—that too in very large font and most of it being

photographs, cannot simply constitute “books” as contemplated in the scheme of

recruitment.

20. However, the Appellant’s submission is that, since the independent Evaluation Panel,

consisting of external experts, has granted marks on the basis that “R2” and “R3” were

books, the Selection Committee has no power under the Circular to remove those marks.

21. In addition to the aforementioned submissions, the Respondents have also raised several

key objections before the Court of Appeal, including futility, acquiescence, laches and

failure to exhaust an effective alternative remedy.

QUESTIONS OF LAW

22. As mentioned earlier, this Court granted special leave to appeal on three questions of law

set out in paragraph 13 of the Petition of Appeal, which are as follows:

(i) “Did the Court of Appeal failed [sic] to consider that the selection committee had

acted beyond its power and this [sic] acted ultra vires?”

(ii) “Did the Court of Appeal failed [sic] to consider the provisions contained in P4

annexed to X1?”

(iii) “Did the Court of Appeal erred [sic] by refusing to grant writs on the basis that

alternative remedies are available?”

ANALYSIS

23. I see it fit to first consider the third and final question of law, as it would not be necessary

for this Court to venture into any other questions if the third question of law is answered

in the negative.

24. The first question of law is whether the Court of Appeal erred in refusing to grant orders

in the nature of writs of certiorari and mandamus as prayed for by the Appellant on the

basis that an alternative remedy was available under the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.

25. It is well understood that a prerogative writ will be refused where there is an adequate

alternative remedy available to the petitioner. This bar, of course, is not an absolute one.

Where a party can satisfy the court as to the existence of any exceptional circumstances,

the court may still exercise its writ jurisdiction despite the existence of an alternative

remedy.

26. As S.N. Silva, J [as His Lordship then was] observed in Halwan and Others v. Kaleelul

Rahuman,2

“…A party dissatisfied with a judgment or order, where a right of appeal is given

either directly or with leave obtained, has to invoke and pursue the appellate

jurisdiction. When such party seeks judicial review by way of an application for a Writ

as provided in Article 140 of the Constitution he has to establish an excuse for his

failure to invoke and pursue the appellate jurisdiction. Such excuse should be pleaded

in the petition seeking judicial review and be supported by affidavits and necessary

documents. In any event, where such a party has failed to invoke and pursue the

appellate jurisdiction the extraordinary jurisdiction by way of review will be exercised

only in exceptional circumstances such as, where the court, tribunal or other

institution has acted without jurisdiction or contrary to the principles of natural

justice resulting in an order that is void. The same principle is in my view applicable

to instances where the law provides for a right of appeal from a decision or order of

an institution or an officer, to a statutory tribunal. The reason is that such appellate

procedure as established by law being the ordinary procedure should be availed of

before recourse is had to the extraordinary jurisdiction by way of judicial review as

provided in Article 140 of the Constitution. The remedy by way of judicial review

should not be allowed to supplant the normal statutory appeal procedure and should

be available only in exceptional circumstances as noted above.”

27. It was the Respondents’ submission in the instant case that, as Sections 80-87 of the

Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 (as amended) provide for the University Services Appeal

Board (USAB), the Appellant ought to have first made her appeal to the USAB under

Section 86(a) of the said Act and exhausted such avenue before she is able to invoke writ

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 140 of the Constitution.

28. Section 86 of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 19783 states as follows:

“The Appeals Board shall have and may exercise the following powers, duties and

functions-

(a) to conduct investigations into appointments and promotions alleged

to have been made to the staff of the Commission and to Higher

Educational Institutions in contravention of the schemes of

3 As amended by Universities (Amendment) Act, No. 7 of 1985 and Universities (Amendment) Act, No. 1 of 1995

SC Appeal 05/2015 JUDGMENT Page 29 of 31

recruitment and the procedures for appointment in force at the time

such appointments or promotions were made or alleged to have been made

and into allegations that appointments or promotions have not been made

to posts when vacancies have arisen in such posts;

(b) to consider appeals from employees of the Commission or any Higher

Educational Institution, who have been dismissed, compulsorily retired, or

otherwise punished for misconduct, inefficiency or dereliction of duty,

against such dismissal, compulsory retirement or other punishment;

(c) to consider appeals from employees of the Commission who were

employees of the old University or any Higher Educational Institution,

relating to compensation payable to employees of the old University under

section 142 of this Act; and

(d) to convey to the Chairman of the Commission or the principal executive

officer of the Higher Educational Institution concerned, as the case may be,

the decisions arrived at after considering such appeals or conducting such

investigations.”4

29. In response, the Appellant submitted that Section 86(a) of the Universities Act was only

applicable to the “staff of the Commission”, i.e. the University Grants Commission, and

that it did not include lecturers.

30. However, as the Respondents correctly submitted, Part X (Sections 71-79) of the

Universities Act, titled “Appointments to the Staff”, deals with the appointment of

“teachers”, specifically under Section 72 therein.

4 Emphasis added

SC Appeal 05/2015 JUDGMENT Page 30 of 31

31. In addition to that, it must also be observed that Section 86(a) of the Universities Act refers

not only to the “staff of the commission” but to “the staff of the Commission and to Higher

Educational Institutions”. Moreover, the case of Prof. (Dr.) Chelliah Elankumaran v. the

University of Jaffna and Others,5 submitted by the Respondents, provide a clear

example of where a lecturer lodged an appeal against a decision of a University to the

USAB and thereafter challenged the decision of the USAB before the Court of Appeal. In

the said case, very much like the instant case, the petitioner lodged an appeal to the USAB

against the decision to appoint him an Associate Professor at the University of Jaffna,

instead of appointing him a Professor.

32. As such, it is my considered view that the language of the statute itself, as well as the

established practice, clearly indicate that the Petitioner-Appellant of the instant case has

an effective alternative remedy under Section 86(a) of the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978.

33. The Appellant has not explained any reason as to why such remedy may not be effective

or expedient. Accordingly, it is my view that the Court of Appeal has not erred in refusing

the Appellant’s application on the basis that an effective alternative remedy was available.

34. The third and final question of law is answered in the negative. As relief prayed for by the

Appellant ought to be refused on this basis alone, I see no necessity to consider the other

two questions of law. The Appeal must therefore stand dismissed with costs.

Appeal Dismissed.
