Eastern Province, dated 21.06.2013 which set aside the judgment of the

District Court of Trincomalee, case bearing No: 1016/00 dated 31.03.2009.

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

“Respondent”) instituted the initial action before the District Court of

Trincomalee against the Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the “Original Appellant”) seeking to eject the Original Appellant

from the land described in the schedule of the plaint and to place the

Respondent in possession of the said property.

The Respondent’s case, as pleaded in the plaint, was founded on an assertion

that her father, Balachandra Arachchilage Edin Singho, had been in actual

and continuous possession of the said property since 1954 and had cultivated

it under authority purportedly granted by the Government Agent of

Trincomalee on 3 November 1973. She averred that Edin Singho had

cultivated the property until 1977, thereafter let it to the Appellant on ground

rent between 1977 and 1981, and then resumed possession in 1982 until

4

possession was allegedly disturbed by the Original Appellant on 20th January

1999. Notably, the Respondent sought only ejectment and did not seek any

declaration of title or entitlement to possession.

The Original Appellant, by answer dated 24 July 2000, denied that the

Respondent’s father had ever possessed or cultivated the property. He

admitted the existence of the temporary permit issued in 1973 but maintained

that Edin Singho had never acted upon it, and had instead transferred

whatever interest he claimed to the Original Appellant for monetary

consideration, expressly agreeing not to assert any claim thereafter. On that

basis, the Original Appellant asserted continuous occupation from 1977 to

date and prayed for dismissal of what he described as a speculative action.

The trial commenced on 5 February 2001, at which point the existence of

Primary Court Case No. 1701 (Kantale) was admitted, and the Respondent

raised twelve issues, countered by seventeen issues raised on behalf of the

Original Appellant. Evidence for the Respondent commenced on 22 April 2002

when Edin Singho testified and produced Temporary Permit No. 5115, issued

under an Emergency Food Cultivation Project.

However, the Original Appellant averred that no documentary or cogent oral

evidence was adduced to establish that he had ever cultivated or possessed

the land pursuant to that permit. The Respondent herself testified on 28 July

2003, attempting to base her claim solely on the said temporary permit. At

the close of her case, Exhibit P1 (the temporary permit) remained the only

documentary foundation of her claim.

The Original Appellant commenced giving evidence on 5 March 2008,

explaining the circumstances under which he entered into occupation and

producing exhibits V1–V3 in support thereof. Upon conclusion of

submissions, the learned District Judge delivered judgment on 31 March

2009 dismissing the Respondent’s action with costs. The Trial Judge held,

inter alia, that the temporary permit had never been renewed or extended,

that no evidence of cultivation by either Edin Singho or his son had been

produced, and that the Respondent had failed to establish any legal basis to

5

obtain ejectment, particularly in the absence of substantial relief or proof of

entitlement.

The Respondent thereafter preferred Civil Appeal No. EP/HCCA/TRN/112/09

to the Civil Appeal High Court of the Eastern Province, Trincomalee. On 21

June 2013, the High Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment of the

District Court, and entered judgment in favour of the Respondent, relying

principally on the temporary permit and overturning the Trial Judge’s factual

findings.

The Original Appellant, being aggrieved by the said judgment, appealed to the

Supreme Court. This Court by Order dated 16.06.2014, granted Leave to

Appeal on the questions of law stated as set out below.

1. Did the Civil Appellate High Court err in failing to consider that the

action filed in the District Court is misconceived in law?.

2. Did the Civil Appellate High Court err in relying on the exhibit “P1”

in granting relief to the Respondent?.

Thereafter, following the death of the Original Appellant, the substituted

Defendant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Substituted

Appellant”) was substituted in his place.

When this matter was taken up for argument, this court drew attention to the

fact the matter in concern was a possessory action which had been filed in

the District Court after one year from the date of dispossession and hence

whether it is time barred.

It is the contention of the Respondent that the Appellant neither in his

pleadings nor in his oral submissions has pleaded any objection pertaining to

time bar and that it is the court that ex mero motu questioned the

Respondent’s counsel as to the matter being filed out of time. The Respondent

in her plaint before the District Court dated 14.02.2000 has stated that the

Appellant on or about 20.01.1999 disturbed the peaceful possession of the

6

land. Thereafter on 28.01.1999 the Kantalai Police produced the Appellant,

her father and sister and the Respondent before the Magistrate in Trincomalee

under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act. Thereafter on

24.02.1999, the Appellant again disturbed the peaceful possession of the

Respondent which the Respondent had immediately brought to the attention

of the court on 25.02.1999 and the Court had severely warned the Appellant.

The Respondent stated that she had been in actual and physical possession

of the land until 25.02.1999.

The Magistrate of Trincomalee thereafter, on 10.02.2000 had made an order

with respect to the section 66 application mentioned above placing the

Appellant in possession of the land. The Appellant has been in possession of

the land since 10.02.2000. The Respondent stated that she had been in actual

and physical possession till 25.02.1999 and she has been dispossessed by

the Appellant from the land since 10.02.2000. The Learned District Court

Judge has concluded that since the Respondent had instituted the District

Court action within one year from 24.02.1999 there is no impediment to

proceed with the same.

The Respondent further contended that there was no undue delay on their

part as the order of the Primary Court case was delivered on 10.02.2000

conferring possession of the land to the Appellant, thereafter the Respondent

being aggrieved by the same had instituted this action in the District Court

within 4 days and that the Respondent has not slept over her rights but has

been pursuing a section 66 case and on adjudication of same has initiated

the possessory action before the district court.

Turning to the established principles of law governing a possessory action in

Sri Lanka, which is a special, summary, and provisional remedy, firmly rooted

in Roman–Dutch law and given statutory recognition by section 4 of the

Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871 which sets out that:

“It shall be lawful for any person who shall have been dispossessed of any

immovable property otherwise than by process of law, to institute proceedings

7

against the person dispossessing him at any time within one year of such

dispossession. And on proof of such dispossession within one year before

action brought, the plaintiff in such action shall be entitled to a decree against

the defendant for the restoration of such possession without proof of title:

Provided that nothing herein contained shall be held to affect the other

requirements of the law as respects possessory cases”.

The section does not create the possessory remedy ex nihilo; rather, it

assimilates pre-existing Roman–Dutch possessory interdicts into statutory

form, while expressly preserving their substantive requirements through the

proviso. Consequently, section 4 must be construed not in isolation or by a

narrow literalism, but in harmony with the common law principles governing

possessory relief.

Section 4 permits the institution of proceedings only where a person has been

dispossessed of immovable property otherwise than by process of law and

requires that such proceedings be instituted within one year of such

dispossession. These requirements are not merely procedural but are

conditions precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction. A failure to satisfy them

deprives the court of authority to grant possessory relief, regardless of the

merits or equities of the case.

The content of these statutory requirements has been authoritatively clarified

by the Supreme Court in P. R. Michael Gunaratne v. Delkadura Danapala

Mudiyanselage Sarathchandra Bandara (SC Appeal No. 83/2013,

decided on 29.02.2024). In that decision, Nawaz J. undertook a

comprehensive analysis of Roman and Roman–Dutch possessory interdicts—

uti possidetis, unde vi, mandament van maintenue and mandament van

spolie—and reaffirmed that the Sri Lankan possessory action reflects these

doctrines in substance. Drawing from this lineage, His Lordship restated the

cumulative elements that a plaintiff must establish in order to succeed in a

possessory action, namely that the plaintiff:

(a) was in possession of the corpus ut dominus;

(b) enjoyed such possession quietly and peaceably;

8

(c) possessed the corpus for a year and a day; and

(d) was ousted or disturbed within the year preceding the institution of the

action.

These elements serve a gatekeeping function. The possessory remedy is not

designed to protect mere assertions of entitlement or transient control, but to

safeguard a factual possession that is sufficiently settled, exclusive, and

proprietary in character. Possession ut dominus does not require proof of legal

title, but it does require proof of possession exercised as of right and not on

behalf of another, nor under a temporary, precarious, or derivative authority.

The insistence on possession for a year and a day reflects the Roman–Dutch

law’s concern with stability of possession and the avoidance of precipitous

litigation arising from fleeting or equivocal acts of control.

The Supreme Court in Michael Gunaratne further clarified that the term

“dispossession” in section 4 is not confined to physical eviction. In appropriate

circumstances, substantial disturbance or obstruction which effectively

deprives the possessor of the free exercise of her possessory rights may

amount to dispossession. This interpretation, endorsed in earlier authorities

such as Perera v. Wijesuriya (1957) 59 NLR 529 and Edirisuriya v.

Edirisuriya (1975) 78 NLR 388, reflects the underlying policy of the

possessory remedy: to prevent breaches of the peace and the taking of the law

into one’s own hands.

However, this extended meaning of dispossession operates only where the

plaintiff first establishes qualifying possession. The law does not recognise a

possessory action in favour of a person who was never in possession.

Disturbance presupposes possession; it cannot exist in vacuo. Nor can a

plaintiff rely on the prior possession of another unless such possession has

lawfully devolved upon her without interruption.

Equally fundamental is the statutory exclusion of dispossession effected by

process of law.

9

Section 4 draws a clear and deliberate distinction between unlawful self-help

and dispossession pursuant to judicial or statutory authority. Where

possession is lost by virtue of an order of a competent court exercising

jurisdiction, whether under the Primary Court Procedure Act or otherwise, the

dispossession is by process of law, and the possessory remedy is unavailable.

The proper recourse in such circumstances lies in appellate or review

proceedings, or in an action based on title, but not in a possessory suit under

section 4.

The one-year limitation prescribed by section 4 is absolute. It reflects the

provisional and emergency character of the possessory remedy. Courts have

consistently held that this period cannot be enlarged on grounds of equity,

diligence, or absence of laches. Where the record discloses a clear failure to

institute proceedings within the statutory period, or a failure to satisfy the

jurisdictional preconditions of the remedy, the court is entitled, and indeed

duty-bound, to take cognisance of such defects ex mero motu,

notwithstanding the absence of a specific plea.

The Respondent’s case, as pleaded in the plaint dated 14.02.2000, is that her

peaceful possession of the corpus was first disturbed on or about 20.01.1999

and again on 24.02.1999, following which the parties were produced before

the Magistrate’s Court of Trincomalee under section 66 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act. She further pleads that she remained in actual and physical

possession until 25.02.1999. These assertions, however, must be tested

against the evidence adduced and the legal requirements of possession ut

dominus.

The Respondent relies principally on a temporary cultivation permit issued in

1973 to her father, Edin Singho. That permit was limited in duration to a

single cultivation season and did not confer any enduring possessory right,

nor did it vest a heritable or transferable interest capable of grounding a claim

of possession decades later. Standing alone, such a permit is manifestly

insufficient to establish possession ut dominus in the Respondent.

10

More critically, the oral evidence of Edin Singho, who testified on behalf of the

Respondent herself, decisively undermines her pleaded claim of possession.

His testimony is unambiguous:

“මගේ බාල දුව වන ගමම නඩුගේ පැමිණිලිකාරිය ගකායිම අවස්ථාවක

ග ෝ ගමම ඉඩගේ පදිංචි වී සිටිගේ නැ ැ”

This evidence admits two matters of fundamental legal consequence. First,

that the Respondent was never in possession of the corpus at any point in

time. Secondly, that possession of the corpus was handed over to the Appellant

by written instrument. This testimony is corroborated by receipts V1, V2 and

V3, executed by the same witness, which record that possession of the land

was transferred to the Appellant for monetary consideration and that the

Appellant’s possessory rights would thereafter be defended by the transferor

in the event of dispute. These documents and admissions are wholly

inconsistent with the Respondent’s assertion that she possessed the land ut

dominus, quietly and peaceably.

In these circumstances, the Respondent cannot succeed by asserting

succession to her father’s possession. The evidence establishes that her father

voluntarily divested himself of possession in 1977, long before the Respondent

claims to have exercised any possessory control. Possession having passed to

the Appellant prior to any alleged succession, the Respondent is not entitled

in law to rely upon her father’s prior possession so as to establish continuity

of possession in herself. One who has never been in possession cannot

maintain a complaint of dispossession, for disturbance is conceptually and

legally dependent upon the prior existence of possession.

Even assuming, for the sake of completeness, that the Respondent’s pleaded

assertion of possession until 25.02.1999 is accepted at face value, the nature

and duration of such possession still fall short of the Roman–Dutch law

standard. The Respondent has not established possession ut dominus for a

year and a day prior to the alleged disturbances. Possession that is contested,

11

derivative, precarious, or unsupported by clear evidence of exclusive control

does not satisfy the threshold required to invoke a possessory remedy under

section 4 of the Prescription Ordinance.

The analysis must then turn to the nature of the alleged dispossession. The

Respondent expressly pleads that the Magistrate’s Court of Trincomalee, upon

inquiry under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, made an order

on 10.02.2000 placing the Appellant in possession, and that she was

dispossessed as a result of that order. Such dispossession is, by definition,

one effected by process of law. Section 4 of the Prescription Ordinance affords

no remedy in respect of dispossession so effected. The fact that the

Respondent instituted the District Court action within four days of the

Magistrate’s Court order, or that she had been diligently pursuing proceedings

before the Primary Court, cannot alter the legal character of that

dispossession.

The Respondent’s reliance on alleged disturbances of 20.01.1999 and

24.02.1999 does not advance her case. Once the parties were before the

Magistrate’s Court under section 66 and subject to its supervisory jurisdiction

pending determination, any alleged interference occurring during that period

cannot be divorced from the judicial process and re-characterised as

dispossession otherwise than by process of law. Further, the Respondent

herself pleads that she remained in possession until 25.02.1999, thereby

acknowledging that no dispossession occurred on those earlier dates.

In any event, even if the disturbance of 24.02.1999 were to be treated as the

relevant act of dispossession, the Respondent has not satisfied the temporal

requirement imposed by section 4. The pleadings as per the plaint is an earlier

disturbance on 20.01.1999. The law does not permit a plaintiff to selectively

rely on one pleaded act of disturbance while disregarding another in order to

overcome the statutory bar of limitation. Where the pleaded cause of action

discloses an initial disturbance occurring more than one year prior to the

institution of proceedings, the action is time barred.

12

The possessory jurisdiction of the District Court is not an elastic or

discretionary jurisdiction; it is a narrowly circumscribed statutory and

Roman–Dutch law remedy, the availability of which depends upon the strict

satisfaction of defined legal conditions. Those conditions are not procedural

niceties capable of being waived by omission or cured by equitable

considerations. They go to the jurisdiction itself.

In the present matter, the attempt to sustain the District Court action on the

footing that time began to run from a later “disturbance” is, in law, untenable.

The plaint itself discloses an earlier disturbance. Once a cause of action of

disturbance is pleaded, the law does not permit a court to isolate a

subsequent incident in order to circumvent the statutory bar imposed by

section 4 of the Prescription Ordinance. Limitation in possessory actions is

not a matter of convenience or impression; it is rigidly tethered to the first

pleaded invasion of possession. A litigant cannot be permitted to approbate

and reprobate by pleading multiple disturbances and then selectively relying

on one to preserve the action.

More fundamentally, even if the later date were to be accepted as the relevant

point of computation, the action remains legally misconceived. A possessory

action presupposes the existence of possession ut dominus and a

dispossession otherwise than by process of law. These are cumulative, not

alternative, requirements. Where the alleged loss of possession arises directly

from an order made by a court of competent jurisdiction under section 66 of

the Primary Court Procedure Act, the law is clear that such dispossession falls

outside the protective ambit of section 4 of the Prescription Ordinance. The

possessory remedy is designed to suppress self-help, not to undermine

judicial determinations by collateral attack.

The Respondent’s emphasis on diligence, promptitude, and continuous

pursuit of remedies, however sympathetic it may appear, is legally irrelevant

to the maintainability of a possessory action. Roman–Dutch law does not

reward vigilance in the abstract; it protects possession in fact and in law.

Where the essential juridical character of possession is absent, and where

13

dispossession occurs by operation of a judicial order, no amount of procedural

expedition can confer jurisdiction where none exists.

The Civil Appellate High Court, in affirming the maintainability of the District

Court action, failed to appreciate that the defect was not one of evidence or

evaluation but of principle. It failed to recognise that the Respondent’s claim

did not fall within the legally cognisable boundaries of a possessory action at

all. In doing so, it permitted the possessory jurisdiction to be invoked in

circumstances expressly excluded by law, thereby diluting the doctrinal

coherence and certainty that underpin this area of jurisprudence.

Accordingly, the action instituted in the District Court is misconceived in law.

The Respondent has failed to establish that she was in possession ut dominus,

quietly and peaceably, for the requisite period, or that she was dispossessed

otherwise than by process of law. The pleaded disturbances disclose an earlier

cause of action which renders the institution of proceedings outside the

statutory period prescribed by section 4 of the Prescription Ordinance, and

the subsequent order made under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure

Act cannot, in law, give rise to a possessory claim.

In these circumstances, the mandatory legal conditions governing possessory

actions not having been satisfied, the District Court was bereft of jurisdiction

to entertain the action, and the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law in

upholding it. The questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted are

accordingly answered in the affirmative, and this appeal is entitled to succeed.

Therefore, having examined the facts of the case, and the material placed

before this court, I allow the appeal of the Appellant by setting aside the

judgment of the Civil Appeal High Court of the Eastern Province, Trincomalee

and uphold the judgement of the District Court of Trincomalee.
