ARGUED ON : 31-10-2025

DECIDED ON : 05-02-2026

P. PADMAN SURASENA, CJ.

The two Plaintiffs in this case (husband and wife), filing the Plaint, prayed for an order to

partition the land described in the Schedule to the Plaint. According to the said Schedule, the

corpus to be partitioned, is described as a land in extent of about 1 Acre, 2 Roods. The

Schedule has described its boundaries as follows:

To the North - Cart road

To the East - the boundary of the paddy field of Welivita Angoda Liyanage

De Yonis Appuhamy

To the South - the boundary of the land of Don Gregory Siriwardena

To the West - the boundary of the land of Ampe Mohottige Thegis Appu

[SC Appeal 158/2017] - Page 10 of 16

10

The Schedule also states that it is the land registered in folio C83/191 at the Gampaha land

registry.

According to the Plaint, there are two owners to the corpus which is named “Alubogahawatte

kotasa”. These two owners and the portions they owned are described in the Plaint as follows:

1. Undivided 5/6th portion of the corpus was owned by Welivita Angoda Liyanage

Nikulas Appuhami (Nikulas Appuhami)

2. Undivided 1/6th portion of the corpus was owned by Amerasinghe Lekamlage

Engohamy.

According to the Plaint, said Nikulas Appuhami by the Deed of Transfer No. 10196 attested

on 06-03-1931 by D.J. Senaratna Notary Public had transferred this undivided 5/6th portion to

Lewis Silva. Thereafter, said Lewis Silva, by the Deed of Transfer No. 4288 attested on 27-02-

1931, attested by M.E.P. Samarasinghe Notary Public, had transferred the said undivided 5/6th

portion to Pieris Appu. Thereafter, said Pieris Appu, by the Deed of Transfer bearing No. 3012

attested on 30-07-1944 by A.T. Basnayake Notary Public, had transferred the said undivided

5/6th portion of the corpus to Robo Singho. It is thereafter that said Robo Singho by Deed of

Gift bearing No. 12198 attested on 29-06-1969 by D.I. Wimalaweera Notary Public, had gifted

the said undivided 5/6th portion of the corpus to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs.

The Plaintiffs in the Plaint itself have averred that the balance 1/6th portion of the corpus had

been transferred by the original owner Engohamy to one Jinadasa Siriwardena but the said

Deed of Transfer cannot be found.

It is the position of the Plaintiffs according to the Plaint, that upon the demise of said Jinadasa

Siriwardena the undivided 1/6th portion of the corpus had devolved on 1st to 4th Defendants

who were held to be the heirs of Jinadasa Siriwardena in the Gampaha DC testamentary case

No. 1664/T.

It is on the above basis that the Plaintiffs in their Plaint had prayed for the partition of the

corpus in the following manner:

(i) 5/6th portion of the corpus to be given to the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs.

(ii) 1/6th portion of the corpus to be given to the 1st and 4th Defendants.

[SC Appeal 158/2017] - Page 11 of 16

11

The 1st to 4th Defendants, in their Statement of Claim, have prayed for the dismissal of the

action of the Plaintiff while also praying to exclude Lot No. 3 in the Plan No. 1054 from the

corpus.

Upon a commission being issued, W.B.L. Fernando Licensed Surveyor has prepared a

Preliminary Plan. This is the Plan No. 306 dated 05-09-1989. While there are three lots

depicted in this plan. Lot 2 depicts a foot path placed diagonally across Lot 1. Therefore, in

Plan No. 306 there are only two main Lots which can be identified as Lot 1 and Lot 3.

During the survey, some persons had submitted a letter to the Court Commissioner stating

that Lot 1 in this Plan is a part of the corpus in a previous partition action bearing Gampaha

DC Case No. 21754/P. They had objected the inclusion of Lot 1 in the corpus on that basis.

The Court Commissioner gave them notice under Section 16(3) of the Partition Law and

accordingly they were added as the 7th to 11th Defendants in the case. However, the 7th to

11th Defendants have neither filed a Statement of Claim nor participated in the trial.

The Plan No. 5788 dated 12-01-1979 prepared BY M.D.J.V. Perera, Licensed Surveyor in the

Gampaha DC Case No. 21754/P was produced in the trial marked 1වී1.

In the course of the proceedings, the Plaintiffs had taken another commission subsequent to

which J.M.D.T. Patrick Reginald, Licensed Surveyor has prepared the second Preliminary Plan

No. 6398 dated 26-04-1988. This plan (Plan No. 6398) shows only the two main lots as Lot 1

and Lot 2. The Plan No. 6398 shows that the middle separating line between Lot 1 and Lot 2

is uncertain. This plan was marked X in the trial. The Plaintiff in her evidence has admitted

that Lot 1 in Plan No. 6398 is the same as Lot 1 in the Plan No. 5788 dated 12-01-1979 which

is the Plan prepared for Gampaha DC Case No. 21754/P (previous Partition Action). The

Plaintiff has further admitted that the said Lot 1 was allotted to her father Heras Singho in the

said Gampaha DC case No. 21754/P. She has also stated that her father Heras Singho had

thereafter subsequently transferred said Lot 1 to the 2nd Plaintiff.

Although the 2nd Plaintiff also had given evidence in the trial, he had passed away before the

conclusion of his evidence. Thereafter, the sister of the 1st Plaintiff had given evidence and

the case for the Plaintiffs was closed, marking the first Preliminary Plan No. 306 as Y, and the

second Preliminary Plan No. 6398 as X.

At the end of the trial, the learned District Judge by his Judgment dated 11-12-2009, for the

reasons set out therein had dismissed the action of the Plaintiffs on the basis that the Plaintiffs

had failed to prove their title to the corpus.

Being aggrieved by the Judgment dated 11-12-2009 pronounced by the District Judge of

Gampaha, the Plaintiffs appealed to the Civil Appeals High Court.

The Civil Appeals High Court by its Judgment dated 15-12-2014 for the reasons set out therein,

has decided to allow the appeal and ordered the partition of the corpus.

The Civil Appeals High Court, in its Judgment, has held that the corpus as a whole as per the

Preliminary Plan must be partitioned as claimed by the Plaintiffs in their Plaint.

The Civil Appeals High Court, in its Judgment, has also made a conclusion that an extent of

48.8 perches must be allotted to the 1st to 4th Defendants.

At the outset, I observe that the Civil Appeals High Court has failed to give any acceptable

and clear reason for its decision. It is not clear as to the basis on which the Civil Appeals High

Court has decided to allot 48.8 perches to the 1st to 4th Defendants. At one point it has stated

as follows:

“ල ොට් 2 දරන ල ොටල ේ විත්ති රුවන්ට හිමි විය යුතු ම්පුර්ණ බිම්ප ප්‍රමොණය පර්ච ේ 48.8

යුතු මුලු පර්ච ේ ංඛ්‍යොව පර්ච ේ 244ක් බවට අප තීරණය රමූ”

Upon the Leave to Appeal Application being supported, this Court by its Order dated 11-08-

2017 has decided to grant Leave to Appeal on the questions of law set out in paragraph 22(d),

22(e), and 22(f) of the Petition of Appeal dated 24-01-2015. These questions of law are as

follows:

[SC Appeal 158/2017] - Page 13 of 16

13

d) Did their Lordships also come to an erroneous conclusion that the

Learned District Judge erred in law when he rejected the pedigree of

the Plaintiffs on the ground that the original owner namely one

Nicholas Appuhamy's title has not been proved whereas the Learned

District Judge has clearly considered the deeds of both parties and

found both deeds are pertaining to the corpus and therefore Nicholas's

undivided 5/6th share or Engohamy's 1/6th share has not been clearly

established to prove the pedigree of the Plaintiffs?

e) Did their Lordships seriously misdirect themselves when they held that

the Plaintiff/Respondents are entitled to undivided 5/6th share from Lot

2 of Plan marked 'X' and the Defendants are entitled to 48.8 perches

by way of prescription when it is settled law that prescriptive title could

be acquired only for a divided portion and when the Plaintiffs are given

undivided rights from Lot 2 it becomes undivided and therefore their

finding that the Defendants are entitled to 48.8 perches by prescription

is totally erroneous?

f) Have their Lordships come to an erroneous conclusion that the

Defendants have not prescribed to entire Lot 2 of Plan marked 'X' when

admittedly the 1st Plaintiff said that Reja Nona was in possession for

well over 50 years and in the Plan No. 5788 marked 181 the eastern

boundary is the defendants' land marked lot 2 in Plan marked 'X' which

was proved by the Defendants by taking a commission and submitting

the Plan No. 1054 where it is clearly stated that Lot 3 in that Plan is

Lot 2 in Plan marked X' and also all the improvements and plantation

were possessed by the Defendants?

I observe that the learned Counsel who appeared for the Plaintiffs in the trial on 07-11-2003

had informed the learned District Judge as follows:1

[SC Appeal 158/2017] - Page 14 of 16

පිඹුලර් අං 2 දරණ ැබැල් ට පමණක් සීමො රන බව ලෙෞරවලයන් දන්වො සිටිමි.”

Thus, it is clear that the Plaintiffs in the course of the trial had confined the corpus to be

partitioned, only to Lot 2 of Plan No. 6398.

Therefore, clearly, the Civil Appeals High Court was in error when it decided to partition the

corpus containing Lot 1 and Lot 2 of Plan No. 6398, when the Plaintiffs themselves had

specifically informed the learned District Judge that they would restrict their case only to Lot

2 of Plan No. 6398. Thus, it was the informed basis of the Plaintiffs that only Lot 2 of Plan No.

6398 which must be taken as the corpus to be partitioned. On that ground alone, the

Judgment of the Civil Appeal High Court cannot be allowed to stand.

The learned District Judge had proceeded to consider the case on the basis that the corpus

as per the Plaint consisted of Lot 1 and Lot 2 in Plan No. 6398. This is the plan marked in the

trial as X. It is the second Preliminary Plan.

The first Preliminary Plan bearing No. 306 was marked in the trial as Y. It is the assertion of

the Plaintiff that the said first Preliminary Plan No. 306 is not correct. Therefore, it is justifiable

for the learned District Judge to proceed on the basis that the Preliminary Plan prepared in

the case is Plan No. 6398, which is the second Preliminary Plan.

Having regard to the plan prepared in Gampaha DC Case No. 21754/P (i.e. Plan No. 5788)

dated 12-01-1980, and also having taken into consideration, the submission made by the

learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs that the Plaintiffs would limit the corpus of the action only

to Lot 2 of Plan No. 6398, dated 26-04-1998, the learned District Judge in his Judgment has

[SC Appeal 158/2017] - Page 15 of 16

15

rightly decided that the corpus of the action should be only Lot 2 in Plan No. 6398 dated 26-

04-1998.

I observe that the Plaintiffs had deliberately suppressed the fact that Lot 1 is a land which

had already been partitioned in the previous partition action, Gampaha DC case No. 21754/P.

The case that the Plaintiffs had presented to the leaned District Judge before the District Court

is that undivided 5/6th portion of Lot 1 and 2 of Plan No. 6398 must be allotted to them.

However, subsequent change of corpus limiting it only to Lot 2 of Plan No. 6398 would

definitely run counter to their claim and proof that they are the owners of 5/6th portion of Lot

1 and Lot 2 of Plan No. 6398.

The learned District Judge having examined the deeds, evidence produced in the trial, had

rightly concluded that the Plaintiffs had failed to prove that they are the owners of 5/6th portion

of the corpus. I have no reason/ basis to deviate from that conclusion. On the other hand, as

has been stated before, the learned Judges of the Civil Appeals High Court have erred in their

Judgment. I have already adverted to the reasons for the same.

In the above circumstances, I answer the questions of law in respect of which the Court has

granted Leave to Appeal, in the following way:

Answer to the first question of law (i.e. Para 22(d)):

The Civil Appeals High Court has come to an erroneous conclusion that the learned

District Judge had erred in law when he held that the Plaintiffs had failed to prove their

title.

Answer to the second question of law (i.e. Para 22(e)):

The Civil Appeals High Court has misdirected itself when it held to partition the land in

the way it had stated in its Judgment dated 15-12-2014

Answer to the third question of law (i.e. Para 22(f)):

The Civil Appeals High Court has come to an erroneous conclusion that the 1st to 4th

Defendants have prescribed to a land.

[SC Appeal 158/2017] - Page 16 of 16

16

Accordingly, I allow the appeal and affirm the Judgment dated 11-12-2009 of the learned

District Judge of Gampaha. I set aside the Judgment dated 15-12-2014 pronounced by the

Civil Appellate High Court.
