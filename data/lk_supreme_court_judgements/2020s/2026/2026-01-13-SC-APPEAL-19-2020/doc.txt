Samayawardhena, J.

The 1ˢᵗ defendant bank passed a resolution under the provisions of the

Recovery of Loans (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 to sell the

mortgaged property which is the subject matter of this case, in order to

recover its dues from the 2ⁿᵈ defendant borrower. The 2ⁿᵈ defendant is the

owner of the property and had mortgaged it to the bank in order to obtain

financial facilities from the bank. The plaintiff is residing on the property.

When the public auction was about to be held, the plaintiff instituted this

action in the District Court of Horana, naming the bank as the 1ˢᵗ defendant,

the owner and mortgagor as the 2ⁿᵈ defendant, the 2nd defendant’s wife as

the 3rd defendant and the auctioneer as the 4th defendant. The only

substantive relief sought by the plaintiff in the prayer to the plaint was a

declaration that he had acquired title to the property by prescription. In

addition, the plaintiff sought an enjoining order and an interim injunction

restraining the bank from proceeding with the parate execution of the

property pending the determination of the action.

SC/APPEAL/19/2020

The District Court issued the enjoining order ex parte. Although the bank

objected to the grant of interim injunction, the Court proceeded to issue the

interim injunction as well. The bank thereafter filed answer seeking

dismissal of the plaintiff’s action.

After trial, the District Court granted the substantive relief sought by the

plaintiff. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kalutara set aside the

judgment of the District Court. A previous Bench of this Court granted leave

to appeal against the judgment of the High Court on the question whether

the High Court erred in law in holding that the plaintiff had failed to

discharge the burden of proving prescriptive title to the property.

There cannot be any dispute that the plaintiff hurriedly instituted this

action to prevent the auction from being held. He succeeded in that attempt,

with respect, due to the failure to properly appreciate the basic principles

of law applicable to the case. At the time the action was instituted,

admittedly, the plaintiff was not the owner of the land. The owner was the

2ⁿᵈ defendant by deed No. 17716 marked 1V2. The plaintiff sought a

declaration that he be declared the owner by prescriptive possession, a

declaration which, if at all, could only have been considered after a full trial.

Moreover, prescriptive possession operates only as a shield of defence and

not as a sword of attack (Terunnanse v. Menike (1895) 1 NLR 200 at 202).

Viewed in that backdrop, the learned District Judge could not, in my view,

have granted either the enjoining order or the interim injunction, as the

plaintiff could not have established a strong prima facie case, which is the

first and foundational test in considering an application for interim

injunction.

The 2ⁿᵈ defendant is the plaintiff’s half-brother, being a son of the plaintiff’s

father from his first marriage. The property was gifted to the 2ⁿᵈ defendant

by deed marked 1V2 by the father. The house standing on the property was

constructed by the father. The plaintiff’s case was that he had been in

4

SC/APPEAL/19/2020

continuous possession of the property without disturbance from any

person. However, he did not assert that such possession was adverse either

to his father or to his half-brother.

Where the relationship between the parties is so close, an overt act clearly

manifesting the commencement of adverse possession, together with strong

and affirmative evidence of the continuation of such adverse possession for

a period exceeding ten years, becomes all the more essential to sustain a

claim of prescriptive title (De Silva v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1978)

80 NLR 292, Podihamy v. Elaris [1988] 2 Sri LR 129). As the High Court has

correctly pointed out, the plaintiff failed to establish these essential

elements in the present case.

I am mindful that, in the instant case, the 2ⁿᵈ defendant did not contest the

plaintiff’s claim. As already noted, he is the borrower and mortgagor who

has defaulted on his obligations to the bank, and therefore had little

incentive to oppose the plaintiff’s assertion. However, if the plaintiff’s claim

of prescriptive title were to be upheld on that basis, it would cause serious

injustice to the bank. A statutory right conferred on the bank cannot be

defeated by a collusive action or by an abuse of the process of Court.

I accordingly answer the question of law on which leave to appeal was

granted in the negative and dismiss the appeal with costs.
