Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action naming three defendants, seeking

partition of the land known as Tukkiniyagodawatta, in extent of one acre,

as depicted in Surveyor General’s Plan No. 185141 marked X2, between

the plaintiff and the 3ʳᵈ defendant. Preliminary Plan No. 600 marked X

was prepared by superimposition of Plan X2. The 4ᵗʰ defendant, who

claimed Lot 2 of the Preliminary Plan, was subsequently added as a

party. He filed a statement of claim seeking the exclusion of Lot 2, in

extent of 5.25 perches, on the basis of prescriptive possession.

4

SC/APPEAL/105/2015

After trial, the District Court entered judgment partitioning the entire

land depicted in the Preliminary Plan, including Lot 2, among the plaintiff

and the 2ⁿᵈ and 3ʳᵈ defendants, and declined to exclude Lot 2 from the

corpus. Being dissatisfied with that judgment, the 4ᵗʰ defendant preferred

an appeal to the High Court, which was dismissed. This appeal, with

leave obtained, is against the judgment of the High Court. Leave to appeal

was granted on the question whether the District Court and the High

Court erred in law and in fact in refusing to exclude Lot 2 from the corpus

in favour of the 4ᵗʰ defendant.

The land claimed by the 4ᵗʰ defendant, namely Pattiyakandakaratura, lies

to the north of the land sought to be partitioned. The contention of the

4ᵗʰ defendant is that Lot B, which forms part of the land depicted in Plan

X2 and of Tukkiniyagodawatta as shown in the Preliminary Plan, had

been possessed by him as part of his land and thereby acquired

prescriptive title to that portion. This contention was rejected by both the

District Court and the High Court.

According to the statement of claim of the 4ᵗʰ defendant, he purchased

Pattiyakandakaratura by Deed No. 1034 dated 06.03.1987. The present

action was instituted on 01.09.1988. Having regard to this time frame,

the 4ᵗʰ defendant could not, on the basis of his own possession, have

acquired prescriptive title unless he was able to establish that his

predecessors in title had also possessed that portion in the manner set

out by section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. However, no such

acceptable evidence was led before the District Court.

The 4ᵗʰ defendant sought to trace his title to Pattiyakandakaratura to a

decree entered in another case, namely Case No. 613/L. However, he

failed to produce the decree, the survey Plan prepared in that case, or

even his own title deed, for the Court to understand with certainty the

southern boundary of his land.

The 4ᵗʰ defendant placed heavy reliance on a purported live fence between

Lots A and B of the Preliminary Plan. According to the evidence of the

5

SC/APPEAL/105/2015

surveyor, this live fence could not be considered an old boundary fence.

His evidence was that there were only a few trees, none of which were of

considerable age. As correctly observed by the High Court, even the

existence of a live fence between Lots A and B would not, by itself,

establish that the 4ᵗʰ defendant had acquired prescriptive title to Lot B.

At the argument, learned Counsel for the 4ᵗʰ defendant submitted that

the 4ᵗʰ defendant had used Lot B as a roadway to gain access to his land,

Pattiyakandakaratura. This contention cannot be accepted, as the

western boundary of the 4ᵗʰ defendant’s land abuts the Alpitiya-Pitigala

main road, providing him with direct access thereto.

In these circumstances, I see no basis to interfere with the judgment of

the High Court. I accordingly answer the question of law on which leave

to appeal was granted in the negative and dismiss the appeal with costs.
