Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Galle against four

defendants seeking partition of the land described in the schedule to the

plaint between himself and the 1ˢᵗ defendant in equal shares. The 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ

defendants were named as parties on the footing that they reside in a house

standing on the land, which is depicted as buildings Nos. 1 and 2 in the

preliminary plan marked X. In the plaint, the plaintiff averred that the said

defendants were entitled only to the superstructure, without soil rights, and

that they could be compensated for the value of the house. The plaintiff set

out his pedigree in the plaint. The 1ˢᵗ defendant did not contest the plaintiff’s

case.

3

SC/APPEAL/45/2017

The 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants filed a joint statement of claim setting out a

different pedigree and claimed entitlement to an undivided ½ share of the

land on that basis. Having done so, they further averred, in the final

paragraph of their statement of claim, that they had also acquired

prescriptive title to ½ share of the land.

It is quite apparent from the said statement of claim that the primary claim

of the 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants to ½ share was founded on devolution of title

based on an alternative pedigree, and not on prescriptive possession. In any

event, it is well settled that a claim of prescription cannot lie in respect of

an undivided share, but only in respect of a definite and identifiable portion

of land.

Significantly, even at the trial, the 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants failed to raise a

proper or intelligible issue on prescription. The issue framed as issue No.

12 reads as follows: “12. පාර්ශවකරුවන්ගේ කාලාවග ෝධී හිමිකම්?” This issue, as

framed, is vague and devoid of any clear legal meaning. It does not assert

that the 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants have acquired prescriptive title to the land or

to any defined portion thereof.

The District Court accepted the pedigree pleaded by the plaintiff and

rejected the pedigree put forward by the 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants. At the trial,

the 1ˢᵗ defendant gave evidence and produced old title deeds in support of

the plaintiff’s pedigree. It is clear that the pedigree advanced by the 2ⁿᵈ to

4ᵗʰ defendants is wholly untenable. They asserted that one Sulaiman Lebbe

was entitled to a ½ share of the land and that they derived title through

him, but conspicuously failed to explain how the said Sulaiman Lebbe

acquired any such entitlement.

The evidence established that the plaintiff and the 1ˢᵗ defendant became

entitled to the land by deed marked P3. It was also the evidence of the 1ˢᵗ

defendant at the trial that the 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants entered upon the land

4

SC/APPEAL/45/2017

as licensees of his predecessors in title. The learned District Judge accepted

this evidence and, among other grounds, rightly rejected the claim of

prescription advanced by the 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the District Court.

A previous Bench of this Court granted leave to appeal to the 2nd to 4th

defendants on the following questions of law, as formulated in paragraph

18 of the petition tendered to this Court seeking leave to appeal.

(a) Did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in affirming the

judgement of the learned trial Judge in the absence of substantial

evidence to prove that the 2nd to 4th defendant-appellants were

licensees?

(b) Did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in failing to appreciate

that the long possession of the 2nd to 4th defendants coupled with

payment of assessment tax for the entirety of the corpus was

sufficient to establish prescriptive title?

(c) Did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal fail to appreciate that the

plaintiff’s and the 1st defendant’s action was a collusive action

designed to eject the 2nd to 4th defendants from the corpus?

(d) Did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal fail to appreciate the

lapses on the part of the learned trial Judge that the plaintiff and

the 1st defendant had filed the said action after a period of 12 years

had elapsed since the execution of the purported transfer deed (P3)

which period alone was sufficient to establish prescriptive title?

Before this Court, the 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants confined their claim solely to

prescriptive possession. They did not assert any right to the land by deed

or by inheritance. In light of what I have already stated, it is sufficient to

conclude that their prescriptive claim cannot succeed. Prescriptive

5

SC/APPEAL/45/2017

possession against the true owner cannot be established in so casual or

perfunctory manner.

I shall now address the questions of law one by one. The first question of

law proceeds on the premise that the plaintiff was required to prove that the

2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants were licensees. I do not agree. Once the plaintiff and

the 1ˢᵗ defendant established their paper title to the land, the burden shifted

to the 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants to demonstrate the basis on which they were in

possession of the land. If their claim is founded on prescription, it is for

them to establish all the requirements of prescriptive possession. There is

no burden on the plaintiff or the 1ˢᵗ defendant to disprove such a claim. Nor

is there any presumption in law that a person found in possession of

another’s land holds such land by prescription.

The second question of law proceeds on the premise that long possession,

coupled with the payment of rates in respect of the entire land, is sufficient

to establish prescriptive title. This proposition is plainly contrary to the

fundamental principles governing the law of prescription. Long possession

and prescriptive possession are not synonymous. Long possession, even

when coupled with the payment of municipal rates, does not ipso facto

satisfy the statutory requirements of section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance.

The third question of law relates to the allegation of collusion. There is no

material to suggest that the partition action was collusive in nature. The

mere fact that co-owners institute a partition action with a view to

terminating co-ownership cannot, by itself, be characterised as collusion.

The predecessor in title transferred the land to the plaintiff and the 1ˢᵗ

defendant by deed P3, expressly acknowledging the presence of the 2ⁿᵈ to

4ᵗʰ defendants on the land. Significantly, as reflected in the schedule to the

deed, the transfer was effected “exclusive of the superstructure of the wattle-

6

SC/APPEAL/45/2017

walled thatched house bearing assessment No. 128/4, Colombo Road

thereon”. This recital is inconsistent with any allegation of collusion.

By the fourth question of law, the 2ⁿᵈ to 4ᵗʰ defendants contend that the

institution of the partition action twelve years after the execution of deed P3

is, of itself, sufficient to establish prescriptive title in their favour. This

contention is unsustainable in law. As already stated, mere lapse of time,

without strict proof of all the essential elements of prescriptive possession,

does not confer title by prescription.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer all the questions of law in the negative.

I affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal and dismiss the appeal, but

without costs.
