[SC/FR/415/2015]

Page 10 of 12 ARGUED ON : 04-09-2025

DECIDED ON : 16-01-2026

P. PADMAN SURASENA, CJ

The Petitioners in this case were Police Constables at the time they filed this Petition, i.e. on

13th November 2015. They have challenged the promotion granted to the 17th to 25th

Respondents as Police Sergeants.

The 17th to 25th Respondents had applied for the said post pursuant to the notice dated 20th

May 2015 (marked 10R1C) issued by the Headquarters of the Special Task Force, calling for

applications for promotion to the post of Police Sergeants in the Special Task Force to fill the

vacancies existing in the Special Task Force. The said notice mandates a minimum service

period of 12 years as a Police Cosntable.

The 1st to 3rd, 5th to 23rd and 25th to 27th Petitioners were directly recruited to the Regular

Service of Sri Lanka Police between 1993 and 1999 (as per annextures P2A - P2AB).

The 4th Petitioner, being a person recruited as a Reserve Police Constable to the Sri Lanka

Police Reserve in June 1993, had subsequently faced the examination for the recruitment of

Police Constables to the Regular Service of Sri Lanka Police. It was thereafter that the

Petitioner was recruited to the Regular Service of Sri Lanka Police as a Constable with effect

from 01st June 1997. The Petitioner claims that his service as a Reserve Police Constable in

the Sri Lanka Police Reserve must be added as a part of his service in the Regular Service in

Sri Lanka Police.

Similarly, the 24th and 28th Petitioners were recruited to the Sri Lanka Police Reserve as

Reserve Police Constables on 23rd July 1992 and 10th February 1993 respectively and

subsequently, upon facing the examination for the recruitment of Police Constables to the

Regular Service, they were recruited to the Regular Service of Sri Lanka Police as Police

Constables with effect from 5th of May 1996. They too claim that their service as Reserve

Police Constables in Sri Lanka Police Reserve should be added to their service in the Regular

Service in Sri Lanka Police.

It is on the above basis that the Petitioners claim that they have more than 15 years of service

in the Regular Service of Sri Lanka Police and therefore were expecting a promotion to the

[SC/FR/415/2015]

Page 11 of 12 rank of Police Sergeant. The complaint made to this Court by the Petitioners is that the 17th

to 25th Respondents had received promotions to the rank of Police Sergeant while they (the

Petitioners) were not promoted.

The issue whether the Petitioners’ service in the Reserve Force should be considered in

calculating the eligibility of the Petitioners for promotion in the Regular Service of Sri Lanka

Police has been dealt with by this Court in SC/FRA/47/2014, decided on 28-03-2025. The

relevant portion from the Judgment in that case is reproduced below:

“13. The primary issue before the Court is whether the Petitioners' service in

the Reserve Force should be considered when calculating their eligibility

for promotion to Chief Inspector of Police and whether the differential

treatment between them and officers absorbed in 2006 constitutes an

infringement of their constitutional rights.

14. This Court finds that the Petitioners' period of service in the Reserve Force

in the rank of Inspector of Police cannot be added when considering their

promotion to the rank of Chief Inspector of Police in the Regular Force in

2013. The Petitioners, who were absorbed into the Regular Force in 1999,

cannot be equated with the Inspectors of Police of the Reserve Force,

who were absorbed into the Regular Force on the 24th February 2006

and whose past service in the Reserve Force was given

due recognition...”

Be that as it may, the real issue in this case is whether the Petitioners who are non-STF

constables can claim the promotions granted to STF constables as per a promotion scheme

dedicated only to STF members. Therefore, the issue whether the Petitioners possess 12

years’ experience in normal Police Force would not be relevant to decide this case.

Admittedly, 17th to 25th Respondents are persons serving in the Special Task Force. They had

applied for the promotion of Police Sergeant in the Special Tasks Force while serving as Police

Constables in the Special Task Force. This is confirmed by the documents which the 10th

Respondent (Inspector General of Police) has produced, marked 10R1a, 10R1b and 10R1c.

The communication marked as 10R3 shows that the 17th to 25th Respondents had earned this

promotion of Police Sergeant for the services they had rendered in the Police Special Task

[SC/FR/415/2015]

Page 12 of 12 Force. They are not promotions granted to them for their service in the normal police service.

The Petitioners are not entitled to use the fact that the 17th to 25th Respondents had

commenced their services in the normal Regular Service of Sri Lanka Police at the time the

Police Special Task Force approved and granted the promotion they had earned for their

service rendered as Police Constables in the Special Task Force, to argue that they (the

Petitioners) have been discriminated. This is because the 17th to 25th Respondents had rightly

earned that promotion for the service they had rendered as Police Constables in the Special

Task Force.

Petitioners have not claimed that they have also served in the Special Task Force. Therefore,

they could not have been granted these promotions. That is simply because they have not

served in the Special Task Force. The Petitioners in this case have not challenged the

promotion scheme applicable to Special Task Force. Instead, the Petitioners only pray that

they also be promoted as Police Sergeants with effect from 17th July 2015 and be paid back

wages and increments since that day. That is the date from which the promotions granted to

the 17th to 25th Respondents took effect.

For the above reasons, I am of the view that there is no justification whatsoever for the

promotion claimed by the Petitioners in this case. Accordingly, I hold that the Petitioners are

not entitled to succeed with their applications. Accordingly, I direct that this Petition must

stand dismissed without costs.
