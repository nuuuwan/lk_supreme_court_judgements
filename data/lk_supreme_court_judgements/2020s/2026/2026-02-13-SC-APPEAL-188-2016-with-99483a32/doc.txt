Appeal No. 189/2016 were preferred by the Accused-Appellant-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) against the judgment of the High court

of Colombo dated 12.03.2015. Aggrieved by which the Accused-Appellant-

Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.

In SC Appeal No. 189/2016, the charge is under Section 64(a) of the Sri Lanka

Bureau of Foreign Employment Act, No 21 of 1985 read with Section 13 of

Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (Amendment) Act No. 56 of 2009.

Section 13 of Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (Amendment) Act

No. 56 of 2009. In SC Appeal No. 189/2016, the Accused–Appellant was

As both appeals arise from the same facts and the same legal issue, both counsel

agreed that SC Appeal No. 188/2016 together with SC Appeal No. 189/2016 be

argued together and to abide by one judgment.

Accordingly, this Court by order dated 19.10.2016 granted special leave to

appeal on the question of law set out in paragraph 14(iii) stated as follows for

both appeals:

“Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider that the

learned Magistrate has not acted as per section 271 of the criminal Procedure

Code where when an accused is not represented by a pleader the law casts a

special burden on the trial judge to explain the prosecution case to the

accused?”

Factual Matrix

The Appellant was the accused in this case before the Magistrates Court of

Colombo. The 2nd Respondent alleged that on 17.02.2011, at Welikada,

Rajagiriya, the Appellant operated an unauthorised foreign employment agency

under the name “Blue Sky”. It was alleged that he promised to obtain a foreign

visa for a person from Sitthnathurai Annathurai and dishonestly obtained a sum

5

of Rs. 210,000. The Appellant was charged under 64(b) of the Sri Lanka Bureau

of Foreign Employment Act, No 21 of 1985 read with Section 13 of Sri Lanka

Bureau of Foreign Employment (Amendment) Act No. 56 of 2009.

Following the amendment introduced by Act No. 56 of 2009, Section 64(a) of

the Act provides that ‘any person who, being a licensee, charges any fee otherwise

than as provided in section 51 for the purposes of providing or securing

employment outside Sri Lanka for any other person, shall be guilty of an offence

under this Act and shall be liable on conviction after summary trial by a Magistrate

to a fine not less than fifty thousand rupees and not exceeding one hundred

thousand rupees and to imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding

two years. The Magistrate shall, in addition, order the offender to refund the fee

which is the subject of the offence to the person from whom such fee was received.’

Following the abovementioned amendment, Section 64(b) provides that ‘any

person who, not being a licensee, demands or receives or attempts to receive for

himself or any other person any money for the purpose of providing or securing

employment for any person outside Sri Lanka, shall be guilty of an offence under

this Act and shall be liable on conviction after summary trial by a Magistrate to a

fine not less than fifty thousand rupees and not exceeding one hundred thousand

rupees and to imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding two

years. The Magistrate shall, in addition, order the offender to refund the money

which is the subject of the offence to the person from whom such money was

received.’

The amended Section 64 substantially enhanced the penalties, substituting the

earlier fine of one thousand to one thousand five hundred rupees with a fine not

less than fifty thousand rupees and not exceeding one hundred thousand

rupees, together with imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding

two years. In the present case, the allegation that the Appellant, without being a

licensed agent, operated an unauthorised foreign employment agency under the

name “Blue Sky” and obtained a sum of Rs. 210,000 on the promise of securing

6

foreign employment, squarely attracts the mischief contemplated under Section

64(b), as amended by Section 13 of Act No. 56 of 2009.

At the trial, the prosecution called six witnesses. One of these witnesses,

identified as PW 6, did not testify in this case. Instead, the prosecution sought

to adopt the testimony that the witness had given in another case. The Appellant

contended that such adoption of evidence is not recognised under the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (as amended) and is therefore unlawful.

The Appellant further stated that he had faced 22 separate cases of a similar

nature. He had been convicted in 9 of them and acquitted in 13. He stated that

three of the convictions were later sent for retrial because the respective charge

sheets had not been read out to him. He maintained that this same defect

occurred in the present case as well.

The Appellant has been in custody since 23.06.2011 the date on which he was

arrested. The learned Magistrate convicted the Appellant on 27.09.2012 and

imposed a sentence of two years’ rigorous imprisonment.

The Appellant appealed to the High Court. The 2nd Respondent did not tender

written submissions and the High Court accepted the submissions filed by the

Appellant. The matter was thereafter taken up for oral argument on 30.10.2014.

During oral argument, the Appellant challenged the conviction on several

grounds, including the failure to read the amended charge, the failure to prove

production P1 and the improper adoption of the testimony of PW 6.

After hearing submissions, the High Court fixed the matter for judgment. The

case was listed for judgment on 19.12.2014. On that date, the learned High

Court Judge informed the Appellant that she required certain clarifications from

the State Counsel. The matter was then re-fixed for judgment on 20.02.2015.

The Appellant stated that when the case was taken up on 20.02.2015, the 2nd

Respondent made fresh submissions. These included an admission that the

7

rubber-stamped charge sheet was unsigned. The 2nd Respondent also

submitted that the Appellant had not been misled by the amended charge and

that the court had no duty to appoint counsel since the Appellant had not

requested legal representation.

The Appellant objected to this procedure. He stated that the acceptance of fresh

submissions after the matter had been fixed for judgment was contrary to the

proper appellate process. He requested that the appeal be re-listed and heard

afresh. This request was refused.

On 12.03.2015, the learned High Court Judge dismissed the appeal and affirmed

the conviction. The Appellant then sought Special Leave to Appeal against the

judgment of the High Court . He asserted that several procedural safeguards

were not followed at the trial and that the High Court failed to consider, among

other matters, the obligations imposed on a trial judge under Section 271 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 (as amended) when an

accused person is unrepresented.

The 2nd Respondent maintained that the prosecution was properly initiated

under Section 64(b) of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Act, as

amended and that the trial before the learned Magistrate was conducted in

accordance with law. The Appellant, though unrepresented, proceeded to trial

and was convicted after the conclusion of the prosecution case. The 2nd

Respondent further asserted that the Appellant appealed to the High Court,

where the appeal was dismissed on a correct evaluation of the material. With

regard to the question of law on which leave was granted, the 2nd Respondent

contends that Section 271(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15

of 1979 (as amended) imposes two duties on a trial judge faced with an

unrepresented accused: to inform the accused of his right to give evidence on his

own behalf and, if the accused elects to testify, to draw his attention to the

principal points in the prosecution case. The 2nd Respondent submitted that

these duties were in fact satisfied. Reliance is placed on the proceedings dated

8

06.09.2012, where the Appellant expressly indicated that he was ready to

proceed and that he would give evidence from the witness box. According to the

2nd Respondent, this demonstrated that the Appellant understood the

prosecution case and elected to testify knowingly. The 2nd Respondent therefore

argued that the absence of a specific recorded explanation under Section 271

does not invalidate the conviction, as established judicial authority recognises

that the lack of explicit wording in the record does not, by itself, vitiate an

otherwise fair trial.

Legal Analysis

Question of law

The question of law on which special leave to appeal has been granted is whether

the learned High Court Judge erred by failing to consider that the trial Magistrate

did not act in accordance with Section 271 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, No. 15 of 1979 (as amended), when the accused was unrepresented.

Section 271 Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979(as amended)

Section 271 imposes a duty on the trial judge to explain the prosecution case

to an accused who does not have legal representation. Section 271 reads as

follows:

“(1) At every trial if and when the court calls upon the accused for his

defence it shall, if he is not represented by a pleader, inform him of his

right to give evidence on his own behalf and if he elects to give evidence

on his own behalf shall call his attention to the principal points in the

evidence for the prosecution which tell against him in order that he may

have an opportunity of explaining them.

(2) At every trial whether evidence is called by the accused or not, the

accused shall have the right of reply.

(3) The failure at any trial of any accused, or the husband or wife as the

9

case may be of any accused, to give evidence shall not be made the

subject of adverse criticism by the prosecution.”

Section 271 is designed to protect an accused who does not have a lawyer and

to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly. It requires the trial judge to inform

an unrepresented accused of his right to give evidence in his own defence. If the

accused chooses to give evidence, the judge must explain the main points of the

prosecution’s case that are adverse to him, so that he can respond properly. The

section also ensures that the accused has a right of reply, whether or not he

testifies and that his decision to remain silent cannot be used against him. In

essence, Section 271 safeguards the accused’s ability to understand the case,

participate meaningfully in his defence and be treated fairly during the trial.

In the present case, the trial record clearly shows that the accused was informed

of his right to give evidence and actively elected to do so. As noted in the appeal

brief at page 48, it is recorded:

“චූදිත විත්ිමේ නඩුව සඳහා සූදානම් බව දන්වයි. චූදිත සාක්ි කූඩුමව සිට සාක්ි ලබා මදන

බව දන්වයි. චූදිත සාක්ියට කැඳවමි.”

In addition, the trial record shows that the accused actively participated in the

examination of witnesses. As noted in the appeal brief at pages 21, 23 and 25, it

is recorded:

“විත්ිකරුට හරස් ප්‍රශ්න ඇසීමම් අයිිවාසිකෙ පහදා මදමි. විත්ිකරු හරස් ප්‍රශ්න මනාෙැි

බව කියා සිටී.”

This indicates that the accused was informed of his right to cross-examine the

witnesses and confirmed that he had no cross-questions at certain points. These

entries demonstrate that the accused was fully aware of the evidence against

him and had the opportunity to challenge the prosecution’s case, thereby

satisfying the substantive requirements of Section 271. The record shows that

10

the accused was able to understand the principal points of the prosecution’s

case, respond meaningfully and exercise his right to participate in his defence.

It is also relevant to note that the journal entry dated 24.11.2011 contains a

court seal indicating that the amended charge sheet was read out to the accused.

However, the entry is not signed by the learned Magistrate. A deficiency in the

form of a journal entry does not, by itself, determine whether the accused

understood the charge. The decisive consideration remains whether any

prejudice was caused.

However, the respondents, during submissions on 30.10.2014, acknowledged

that the Appellant was initially charged under Section 64(a) of the Sri Lanka

Bureau of Foreign Employment Act No. 21 of 1985, but the charge sheet was

later amended to Section 64(b). The State admitted that the amended charge

sheet was not read out to the accused and that there was no record or case note

reflecting that it had been read.

“ව උත්තරකරුවන් මවනුමවන් කරුනු දක්වයි.

රු ෙැිණියනි, මුලින්ෙ මෙෙ චූදිත අභියාචක හට මචෝදනා පත්‍රමේ මචෝදනාව මවලා ිබුමේ

ශ්‍රී ලංකා විමේශ මස්වා නියුක්ි කාර්‍යංශ පනමත් 64(අ) ව න්ිය යටමත්. නමුත් උ ත් නීිඥ

ෙහත්ෙයා ප්‍රකාශ කළ ආකාරයටෙ එය 64(ආ) ව න්ිය යටමත් සංමශෝධනය කල බවට

මචෝදනා පත්‍රමයන් පැහැදිලි වන නමුත් එෙ මචෝදනාව නැවත එෙ මචෝදනාව නැවත එෙ

සංමශෝධිත මචෝදනා පත්‍රය චූදිත හට කියවා දීෙක් මනාෙැත යැයි කරුණ රජය

පිළි න්නවා.”(page 45 of the Appeal brief).

Although the State has conceded that the amended charge under Section 64(b)

was not formally read out to the accused, the central question before this Court

is whether that omission caused a failure of justice so as to vitiate the conviction.

Section 271 is intended to ensure fairness to an unrepresented accused. It is

not meant to nullify a conviction for a mere procedural lapse in the absence of

prejudice. In the present case, the trial record clearly shows that the accused

was aware of the substance of the allegation against him. He actively participated

11

in the trial. He elected to give evidence on his own behalf. He was also afforded

the opportunity to challenge the prosecution case. The evidence led by the

prosecution, the defence adopted by the accused and his testimony all relate

directly to the ingredients of the offence under Section 64(b). This demonstrates

that the accused understood the case he was required to meet. Accordingly, the

failure to read out the amended charge, though an irregularity, did not occasion

a miscarriage of justice. It is not of such gravity as to vitiate the conviction.

The present case bears similarities to the decision in The King v. Roma (129-

130 D. C. (Crim.) Kalutara, 3666, 7th October 1919), 7 CWR 14 where the

accused was unrepresented and informed of his right to give evidence, but the

trial judge did not call his attention to the principal points of the prosecution’s

case. Schneider, A.J., observed:

“I am not sure that the failure to observe the provisions of section 296

is an irregularity or omission of the kind contemplated in section 425 of

the Criminal Procedure Code. It seems to me to be something more. It is

an illegality. But I do not feel justified in the present case in not following

the precedent of Somaliya v. Kaluwa. I would therefore dismiss the

appeal.”

In that case, the Court held that the conviction was not vitiated, as the evidence

given by the accused showed that he was fully aware of the effect of the evidence

against him and had not been prejudiced by the omission. The Court also

referred to earlier authorities, noting that even where the record does not

expressly show compliance with procedural requirements, a conviction may

stand if the accused clearly understood the prosecution’s case. Schneider, A.J.,

explicitly relied on Somaliya v. Kaluwa (4 CWR 121) and stated:

“The evidence shows that the accused [was] quite aware of the effect of

evidence against them. They have not complained that they have in any

way been prejudiced.”

12

Similarly, in the present case, although certain procedural formalities under

Section 271, such as explicitly recording that the prosecution’s principal points

were explained to the accused, may not have been perfectly documented, the

accused actively participated in the trial, cross-examined witnesses and

addressed the evidence against him. In light of The King v. Roma (129-130 D.

C. (Crim.) Kalutara, 3666, 7th October 1919),7 CWR 14 these omissions do

not vitiate the conviction, as the accused suffered no prejudice and was fully able

to understand and respond to the prosecution’s case.

The principle articulated in The King v. Roma (129-130 D. C. (Crim.) Kalutara,

3666, 7th October 1919) 7 CWR 14 was further affirmed in Muhandiram v.

Simon [1928] 30 NLR 151,(P.C. Hambantota, 8145), where Dalton J.

considered the effect of a Magistrate’s failure to strictly comply with section

296(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code when the accused was unrepresented.

His Lordship held that “the failure on the part of the Magistrate to comply with the

requirements of section 296 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code did not vitiate the

conviction,” where the accused’s own evidence demonstrated that he had

understood the principal points in the prosecution case. Dalton J. emphasised

that although strict compliance with the section is important, the decisive factor

is whether the accused was prejudiced. The Court observed that “it is clear from

his evidence that he understood the principal points in the evidence of the

witnesses for the prosecution against him,” and that he was “quite aware of the

effect of the evidence against him.” Relying on The King v. Roma (129-130 D.

C. (Crim.) Kalutara, 3666, 7th October 1919)7 CWR 14 and Somaliya v.

Kaluwa (4 CWR 121), the Court affirmed that a conviction will not be set aside

merely due to procedural omission, where the record and conduct of the accused

show clear awareness of the case he had to meet. This reasoning directly applies

to the present case.

The same principle was reiterated in King v. Joseph [1934] 36 NLR 416 (D.C.

(Crim.) Colombo, 10817), where Dalton J. held that the mere absence of a

13

record indicating compliance with section 296 of the Criminal Procedure Code

does not justify an inference that the section was not complied with. His Lordship

observed that “the Supreme Court will not infer from the mere fact that no record

has been made that the section had not been complied with.” The Court

emphasised that where the petition of appeal does not allege non-compliance

and where there is no material before Court to show that the accused was

unaware of his rights, a conviction should not be disturbed. Dalton J. further

held that if the provisions of the section were in fact complied with, but not

recorded and “no prejudice whatsoever has in that event been caused to the

accused,” ordering a retrial would be unwarranted. The Court affirmed that

procedural omissions relating to the recording of compliance do not vitiate a

conviction unless actual prejudice is demonstrated. This reasoning, consistent

with The King v. Roma (129-130 D. C. (Crim.) Kalutara, 3666, 7th October

1919) and Muhandiram v. Simon [1928] 30 NLR 151, (P.C. Hambantota,

8145), supports the position that non-compliance with the formal aspects of

section 271 does not automatically invalidate a conviction in the absence of

prejudice to the accused.

Although certain formal requirements, including the reading of the amended

charge sheet under Section 64(b), were not fully complied with, there was no

practical prejudice to the Appellant. Section 64(a) applies to licensed agents who

charge fees outside the limits provided under the law, while Section 64(b)

applies to persons who are not licensed but receive or attempt to receive money

for providing employment abroad. In the present case, the Appellant was charged

under Section 64(b) and the trial record shows that he was fully aware of the

nature and substance of the allegations against him.

He actively participated in the trial, elected to give evidence on his own behalf

and had the opportunity to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. His

conduct demonstrates that he understood the main aspects of the prosecution’s

case and responded appropriately. While the charge was amended from Section

14

64(a) to 64(b), the Appellant was not misled or disadvantaged by this change.

He was able to comprehend the essential elements of the offence and present his

defence effectively.

For this reason, the procedural lapses did not compromise the fairness of the

trial or the validity of the conviction. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge

did not err in law. The judgment of the High Court is affirmed.

I answer the question of law on which leave has been granted in the negative.

Appeal dismissed.
