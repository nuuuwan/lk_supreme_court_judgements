Thus, equality before the law does not mean that persons who are different shall be treated as if they were the same.

The State has the power of what is known as \u2018classification\u2019 on a basis of rational distinction relevant to the particular subject dealt with. So long as all persons falling into the same class are treated alike, there is no question of discrimination and there is no question of violating the equality clause. The discrimination that is prohibited is treatment in a manner prejudicial as compared to another person in similar circumstances. So long as classification is based on a reasonable and a justifiable basis, there is no violation of the constitutional right to equality. What is forbidden is invidious (unfair / offensive / undesirable) discrimination. The guarantee of equal protection is aimed at preventing undue favour to individuals or class privilege, on the one hand, and at hostile discrimination or the oppression of equality on the other. Since the essence of the right guaranteed by Article 12 and the evils which it seeks to guard against are the avoidance of designed and intentional hostile treatment, or discrimination on the part of those entrusted with the administering of the same, a person setting up grievances of denial of equal treatment must establish that between persons similarly circumstanced, some were treated to their prejudice and the differential treatment had no reasonable relevance to the object sought to be achieved.\u201d [emphasis added] (47) While in terms of Article 12(1), the basis of classification must generally be so drawn",

In my respectful opinion they do not need to be warned off the course by admonitory circumlocutions. When, in Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council, the precise meaning of \"unreasonably\" in an administrative context was crucial to the decision, the five speeches in the House of Lords, the three judgments in the Court of Appeal and the two judgments in the Divisional Court all succeeded in avoiding needless complexity. The simple test used throughout was whether the decision in question was one which a reasonable authority could reach. The converse was described by Lord Diplock as \"conduct which no sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities would have decided to adopt.\" These unexaggerated criteria give the administrator ample and rightful rein, consistently with the constitutional separation of powers.\u201d [emphasis added] (77) This brings me back to P11.
