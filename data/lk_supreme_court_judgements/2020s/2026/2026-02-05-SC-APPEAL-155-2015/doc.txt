Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiffs, the Sri Lanka Coconut Producers Co-operative Societies

Union and its broker, instituted this action against the defendant,

Stassen Export Limited, twenty-two years ago, in the year 2004, seeking

to recover a relatively modest sum of Rs. 192,500 with interest, together

with a further sum of Rs. 10 million as damages.

The defendant filed answer seeking the dismissal of the action on the

basis that, being an agent of a disclosed principal, namely the

Kammalpattu Coconut Producers’ Co-operative Society Limited, the

plaintiffs were not entitled to institute the action against the defendant.

After trial, the District Court entered judgment in favour of the plaintiffs,

save in respect of the claim for damages. On appeal, the High Court of

Civil Appeal accepted the aforesaid defence of the defendant and set aside

the judgment of the District Court.

This appeal by the plaintiffs is against the said judgment of the High

Court.

A previous Bench of this Court granted leave to appeal against the

judgment of the High Court on several questions of law. However, when

the matter came up for argument before this Bench, the Court was

invited to answer only the following question of law: Can a broker or agent

maintain an action for the sale proceeds against the buyer where the

principal is disclosed?

The facts are briefly as follows. The 1ˢᵗ plaintiff, the Sri Lanka Coconut

Producers Co-operative Societies Union, acted as a broker in the sale of

4

SC/APPEAL/155/2015

desiccated coconut produced by one of its member societies, namely the

Kammalpattu Coconut Producers’ Co-operative Society Limited. The 2ⁿᵈ

plaintiff, a natural person, functioned as the representative of the 1ˢᵗ

plaintiff in the said business transactions.

The plaintiffs entered into the sale agreement dated 06.06.2003 (P5 and

P6), with the defendant for the sale of 5,000 kg of desiccated coconut

produced by the Kammalpattu Coconut Producers’ Co-operative Society

Limited at a price of Rs. 335,000 (P7). In terms of the said written

agreement, the defendant shall make the payment to the 1ˢᵗ plaintiff.

There is no dispute that, out of the total sum of Rs. 335,000, the

defendant paid a sum of Rs. 142,440 to the 1ˢᵗ plaintiff (P13). However,

the defendant refused to pay the balance sum of Rs. 192,560 on the basis

that a quantity of desiccated coconut supplied by the Kammalpattu

Coconut Producers’ Co-operative Society Limited to the defendant on a

previous occasion was of inferior quality, and on that basis claimed to

have set off the alleged loss arising therefrom against the amount due

under the present transaction.

The plaintiffs informed the defendant that they had no connection with

the earlier transaction, which had been concluded under a separate

written agreement through a different broker, namely Raymond & Co,

and that they bore no responsibility in respect thereof. Notwithstanding

this position, the defendant declined to settle the outstanding balance

on a technical objection grounded in the law of agency.

At this juncture, let me pause to recall the words of wisdom of Abrahams

C.J. in Vellupillai v. The Chairman, Urban District Council (1936) 39 NLR

464 at 465, made nearly nine decades ago: “This is a Court of Justice; it

is not an Academy of Law.”

The defendant has refused to make payment of the outstanding balance

relying on Bowstead & Reynolds on Agency (17ᵗʰ Edition) at page 459,

which states that “there is no doubt whatever as to the general rule as

5

SC/APPEAL/155/2015

regards an agent, that where a person contracts as an agent for a

principal, the contract is the contract of the principal and not that of the

agent; and prima facie, at common law the only person who may sue is

the principal and the only person who can be sued is the principal.”

Undoubtedly, this statement reflects the general rule. However, it is not

an absolute rule devoid of exceptions. Like any other principle of law, it

admits of exceptions, the applicability of which must be assessed in the

light of the particular facts and circumstances of each case. One such

exception is where the principal has either expressly or impliedly

authorised the agent to sue on behalf of the principal.

It is well established that agency is fundamentally a contractual

relationship. It creates obligations between the principal and the agent,

under which each acquires against the other certain rights and liabilities,

and also gives rise to contractual relations between the principal and

third parties.

In Horace Brenton Kelly v. Margot Cooper and another [1993] 1 AC 205 at

213–214, Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that agency is a contract

between principal and agent, and that, like every other contract, the

rights and duties of the principal and agent depend upon the express or

implied terms of the contract between them.

Consistent with this approach, the Courts have held that the question

whether an agent is personally liable on, or entitled to enforce, a contract

depends upon the intention of the parties as objectively ascertained. In

Bridges and Salmon Ltd v. The “Swan” (Owners) [1968] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 5

at 12, Brandon J. articulated the principle in the following terms:

Where A contracts with B on behalf of a disclosed principal C, the

question whether both A and C are liable on the contract or only C

depends on the intention of the parties. That intention is to be

gathered from (1) the nature of the contract, (2) its terms and (3) the

surrounding circumstances: see Bowstead on Agency, (12th ed.)

6

SC/APPEAL/155/2015

(1959), at pp 257 and 258, par. 113, and the authorities there cited.

The intention for which the Court looks is not the subjective intention

of A or of B. Their subjective intentions may differ. The intention for

which the Court looks is an objective intention of both parties, based

on what two reasonable businessmen making a contract of that

nature, in those terms and in those surrounding circumstances,

must be taken to have intended.

This principle was also recognised in Maritime Stores Ltd v. H.P. Marshall

& Co Ltd [1963] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 602, where Roskill J. held that the question

whether an agent can sue or be sued on a contract is ultimately a

question of fact.

In Montgomerie v. United Kingdom Mutual Steamship Association Ltd

[1891] 1 QB 370 at 371, Wright J. stated the general rule in the following

terms:

There is no doubt whatever as to the general rule as regards an

agent, that where a person contracts as agent for a principal the

contract is the contract of the principal, and not that of the agent;

and, prima facie, at common law the only person who may sue is

the principal, and the only person who can be sued is the principal.

To that rule there are, of course, many exceptions.

Elaborating on those exceptions, His Lordship further observed at page

372:

Also, and this is very important, in all cases the parties can by their

express contract provide that the agent shall be the person liable

either concurrently with or to the exclusion of the principal, or that

the agent shall be the party to sue either concurrently with or to the

exclusion of the principal.

This means, the parties can agree that the agent may sue and be sued

on the contract, either together with the principal or instead of the

principal.

7

SC/APPEAL/155/2015

This principle was reaffirmed and applied in Fact 2006 Pte Ltd v. First

Alverstone Capital Ltd and another [2015] SGHCR 5, where the Singapore

High Court held that the general rule that an agent cannot sue on a

contract is only a prima facie position and may be displaced by express

agreement. The Court affirmed that parties are free by contract to provide

that an agent shall be the person liable or entitled to sue, either

concurrently with or to the exclusion of the principal, as recognised in

Montgomerie v. United Kingdom Mutual Steamship Association Ltd

(supra). On the facts of that case, although the plaintiff was described as

an “agent”, it was expressly named as a party to the agreement and

entitled to receive payment, and was therefore held to be contractually

authorised to sue in its own name.

The same principle is stated in Sealy and Hooley on Commercial Law:

Text, Cases and Materials (6ᵗʰ edition 2020) at page 179, where it is

observed that an agent is entitled to sue upon a contract made on behalf

of the principal where it is the intention of the parties that the agent

should have rights as well as liabilities under the contract. The learned

authors further observe, at the same page, that:

Where the agent has some special property in the subject matter of

the contract, or possesses a lien over it, or has a beneficial interest

in completion of the contract, he may sue the third party. For

example, the auctioneer’s right to sue the highest bidder for the price

stems from his special property in, or lien over, the subject matter of

the sale he effects (Benton v. Campbell Parker & Co [1925] 2 KB 410

at 416, per Salter J); although the right of action actually arises

under a collateral contract between the auctioneer and the highest

bidder (Chelmsford Austions Ltd v. Poole [1973] QB 542 at 548-549,

per Lord Denning MR).

This principle is illustrated by the decision in Short and Others v.

Spackman (1831) 2 B & Ad 962, where Lord Tenterden C.J. observed

that, although he initially had difficulty in accepting that the brokers

8

SC/APPEAL/155/2015

could sue, “on looking to the contract itself, there appears nothing to

prevent it.” Parke J. further held that the plaintiffs were authorised by

their principal to enter into the transaction and that the contract was

binding upon them.

In light of the foregoing authorities, the question whether an agent may

sue or be sued on a contract made on behalf of a disclosed principal is

ultimately one of construction, turning on the express or implied

intention of the parties as gathered from the terms of the contract and

the surrounding circumstances, and is therefore a question of fact.

As stated earlier, the sale and purchase agreement relevant to this case

was entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendant. It is true that

the plaintiffs were acting as agents in selling goods produced by

Kammalpattu Coconut Producers’ Co-operative Society Limited.

However, in terms of the agreement, the defendant was required to pay

the purchase price to the 1ˢᵗ plaintiff and not to Kammalpattu Coconut

Producers’ Co-operative Society Limited.

Kammalpattu Coconut Producers’ Co-operative Society Limited has

made it clear that it was the responsibility of the plaintiff to recover the

full purchase price from the defendant and thereafter remit the amount

due to it. By letter dated 16.09.2003 marked P14, the said Society wrote

to the plaintiff stating as follows:

ඉහත ක ොන්ත්‍රොත්තුකේ හිඟ මුදල් ඩිනමින්ත්‍ ලබොදීමට තැරැේ රු වශකෙන්ත්‍ ඔබකේ

වගකීමක් බව අවධොරණෙ රමි. එම ක ොන්ත්‍රොත්තුවට අදොල සැපයීම් ප්‍රමොදෙකින්ත්‍

කතොරව සිදු ර දැනට මොස 02 ට වැඩි ොලෙක් ගත වී ඇති බැවින්ත්‍ කනොපමාව අප

සමිතිෙට ලැබීමට ඇති ඉතිරි මුදල් ලබො කදන කලස ඉල්ලො සිටිමි.

There is no dispute that, in the instant case, the agent remits the

contract price to the principal after retaining its commission. To that

extent, the agent “has a beneficial interest in the completion of the

contract”, bringing the case within the recognised exception that permits

an agent to sue on the contract made on behalf of the principal.

9

SC/APPEAL/155/2015

Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, I hold that the

1ˢᵗ plaintiff is entitled to recover the balance sum together with interest

from the defendant.

The High Court considered the principle relating to an agent contracting

for a disclosed principal in the abstract and treated the general rule that

only the principal may sue the buyer as an absolute rule of law. In doing

so, the High Court failed to appreciate the recognised exceptions to that

rule and to apply the law to the specific facts and circumstances of the

present case.

I therefore answer the question of law on which leave to appeal was

granted as follows: As a general rule, an agent contracting for a disclosed

principal cannot maintain an action in respect of the contract, but on

the facts and circumstances of this case, the plaintiffs are entitled to do

so.

Accordingly, the judgment of the High Court is set aside, and the

judgment of the District Court is restored. The plaintiffs are entitled to

costs in all three Courts.
