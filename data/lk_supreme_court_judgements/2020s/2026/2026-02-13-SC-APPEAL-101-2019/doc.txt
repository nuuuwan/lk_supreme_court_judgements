The application for special leave to appeal was preferred by the Respondent-

Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) against the Order

of the Provincial High Court dated 17.01.2019. Aggrieved by which the

Respondent-Appellant-Appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.

Accordingly, this court by order dated 12.06.2019 granted special leave to

appeal on the following question of law set out in paragraph 12(ii).

“12 (ii). Has the learned High Court Judge erred in coming to the conclusion

that the termination of the Respondent's services by the Petitioner Bank was

arbitrary, unreasonable and unfair?”

Factual Matrix

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) filed an application against the Respondent- Appellant- Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) before the Labour Tribunal of Colombo

in terms of Section 31B of the Industrial Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950 (as

amended). The Appellant stated that the Respondent was employed by the

Appellant Bank as a Business Development Officer on or about 10.01.2008

(Appointment Letter marked as R1). The Appellant stated that the Respondent

failed to report to work from 16.06.2008 and, as a result, the Respondent was

informed that he was deemed to have vacated his post by letter dated

25.08.2008. The Appellant further stated that after considering the Respondent’s

appeal to the Senior Manager, Human Resources, he was reappointed to the

4

same post as a Business Development Officer on or about 03.05.2010 under a

new letter of appointment.

The Appellant stated that during the course of the Respondent’s employment,

his performance was unsatisfactory and below the standard expected by the

Bank. Consequently, his probationary period was extended by a further six

months from 03.05.2011 to 02.11.2011(letters marked as R4), and he was also

issued a warning letter during the said period (marked as R5). However, he was

absorbed to the permanent cadre as a Banking Assistant by letter dated

16.11.2011(marked as A5).

The Appellant further stated that while the Respondent was in service, the

Appellant Bank received a complaint from a customer in relation to the

Respondent’s personal financial dealings. It was alleged that such conduct was

improper and inconsistent with the standards expected of an employee of a bank

and involved breaches of the Bank’s rules and disciplinary procedures. In view

of these allegations, the Bank commenced an internal investigation into the

Respondent’s conduct. Thereafter, the Bank issued a letter setting out the

alleged acts of misconduct (marked as R9), and called upon the Respondent to

show cause. Pending the conclusion of the disciplinary process, the Respondent

was suspended from service by letter dated 23.04.2012 in terms of the applicable

disciplinary framework of the Bank.

Thereafter, by letter dated 14.10.2012 (marked as R14), the Respondent denied

all the charges and provided his explanation in respect of the same. The

Appellant Bank proceeded to consider the same and found the explanation to be

unsatisfactory. In the circumstances, the Appellant decided to pursue the matter

further in accordance with its disciplinary procedures.

In the course of the disciplinary process, and prior to the conduct of the formal

inquiry, the Appellant carried out preliminary investigations into matters relating

to the Respondent’s service record. During such inquiries, the Appellant received

5

information suggesting that the GCE Advanced Level certificate submitted by the

Respondent at the time of obtaining employment with the Bank was not genuine.

Consequently, the Appellant sought verification of the said GCE Advanced Level

certificate from the Principal of Isipathana College and the Certificate Branch of

the Department of Examinations. The Appellant was informed by the said

authorities that the particulars contained in the certificate tendered by the

Respondent did not correspond with the official records relating to him and that

the certificate was not authentic.

In view of the foregoing, the Appellant proceeded to conduct a disciplinary

inquiry into the charges set out in the Show Cause Notice, including the

allegation that the Respondent had secured employment with the Bank by

tendering a false certificate. Having considered the material placed before it and

the gravity of the misconduct alleged, the Appellant determined that the

Respondent had committed serious misconduct.

Accordingly, taking into account the seriousness of the acts complained of, the

Appellant summarily terminated the services of the Respondent by letter dated

12.04.2013 (marked as R33).

The Appellant stated that the termination of the Respondent’s services was

lawful, justifiable, and equitable, and that the Respondent was not entitled to

any relief from the Labour Tribunal. Further stated that the Respondent

nevertheless filed an application before the Labour Tribunal of Colombo seeking

reinstatement with back wages, or in the alternative, compensation.

After the inquiry, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal, by Order dated

25.01.2018, found in favour of the Respondent and directed reinstatement of his

services without a break in service, with remuneration to be paid in accordance

with the current salary scale applicable to his post. The Appellant, being

dissatisfied with the said Order, preferred an appeal to the Provincial High Court

of the Western Province holden in Colombo, bearing Case No. HC ALT 14/2018.

6

The Appellant stated that the learned High Court Judge, by Judgment dated

17.01.2019, dismissed the Appellant’s appeal. The Appellant further stated that

the High Court affirmed the Order of the Labour Tribunal, directing the

reinstatement of the Respondent with back wages. The Appellant, aggrieved by

the said Judgment, preferred the present Application for Leave to Appeal to this

Court, on the basis that the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge is

contrary to law, against the weight of evidence, and that both the Labour

Tribunal and the High Court have erred in their appreciation of the facts and

law.

The Respondent stated that he filed an application before the Labour Tribunal of

Colombo on 08.10.2013, claiming that his services were unjustly terminated by

the Appellant Bank. He sought reinstatement, back wages, statutory dues, and

any other relief deemed appropriate by the Tribunal. The Appellant, while

admitting the termination of employment, opposed the application and prayed

for its dismissal.

The Respondent contended that the Appellant had summarily terminated his

employment by letter dated 12.04.2013 without conducting a proper disciplinary

inquiry. The Respondent denied submitting any false documents or

misrepresenting his qualifications. The Respondent also stated that the Bank

had not provided any proof of misconduct on his part concerning the alleged

Advanced Level certificate and other documents.

During the course of the proceedings of the Labour Tribunal, the Respondent

presented his testimony and marked documents to substantiate his position,

while the Appellant Bank produced witnesses and documents in support of its

claims. The Respondent emphasized that the evidence presented by the

Appellant was insufficient to establish that he had engaged in forgery or

dishonesty. Consequently, the Respondent argued that his termination was

arbitrary, unreasonable, and unfair, and that he was entitled to reinstatement

with back wages and associated statutory benefits.

Legal Analysis

Question of Law

The question of law on which special leave to appeal has been granted is whether

the learned High Court Judge erred in concluding that the termination of the

Respondent’s services by the Appellant Bank was arbitrary, unreasonable, and

unfair. In addressing this question, it is necessary to consider whether the

Labour Tribunal and the High Court properly applied the statutory framework

governing termination disputes, and whether the evidence before the Tribunal

justified the relief that was granted.

Sections under the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended).

Section 31C(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, as amended [the Act] provides

that, “Where an application under section 31B is made to a labour tribunal, it shall

be the duty of the tribunal to make all such inquiries into that application and hear

all such evidence as the tribunal may consider necessary, and thereafter make,

not later than six months from the date of such application, such order as may

appear to the tribunal to be just and equitable.”

Section 31C of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended), sets

out the duties and powers of the Labour Tribunal. It applies to cases involving

termination of employment under Section 31B. Section 31B establishes a

substantive obligation upon the Tribunal to “make all such inquiries into that

application and hear all such evidence as the tribunal may consider necessary,

and thereafter make, not later than six months from the date of such application,

such order as may appear to the tribunal to be just and equitable.”

The case of John Keells Holdings PLC and Others v M. Ganeshmoorthy [(S.C.

Appeal 187/2017), decided on 20.01.2020] reaffirmed the Tribunal’s statutory

duty under Section 31C(1), read with Section 33. The Supreme Court observed

8

that the Labour Tribunal is required to inquire into all relevant matters, hear all

necessary evidence, and ultimately make an order that is “just and equitable.”

As noted by Amerasinghe, J. in Jayasuriya v Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation [(1995) 2 Sri LR 379; at page 392],

“The Tribunal must make an order in equity and good conscience, acting

judicially, based on legal evidence rather than on beliefs that are fanciful or

irrationally imagined notions or whims. Due account must be taken of the

evidence in relation to the issues in the matter before the Tribunal. Otherwise,

the order of the Tribunal must be set aside as being perverse.”

In the case of N.W.D.T.Nanayakkara v North Central Provincial Road

Passenger Transport Authority [(SC Appeal 37/2023), decided on

10.10.2025] at page 9-10], Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere stated,

“It would perhaps also be important to emphasise that a Labour Tribunal does

not possess an unfettered power and that considerations of justice and equity

must necessarily control and limit the powers of Labour Tribunals. H. N. G.

Fernando, J. (as he then was) observed in Walker Sons & Co. Ltd. v Fry [68

NLR 73] that a Labour Tribunal does not have the "freedom of the wild ass”

in determining the relief that should be granted.”

Legal Principles Governing Termination

It is a fundamental principle of employment law that an employer may terminate

an employee for misconduct that strikes at the core of the employment

relationship. Misconduct involving dishonesty or submission of false documents

constitutes gross misconduct. In such cases, termination may be justified even

without an elaborate disciplinary process, provided the employer acts

reasonably.

Even in cases of gross misconduct, the employer must observe basic principles

of natural justice by affording the employee an opportunity to respond, generally

9

through a show-cause notice or disciplinary inquiry. Courts examine whether

the employee had a fair opportunity to explain or defend themselves prior to

termination.

Termination must also be a proportionate response to the misconduct. Positions

of trust, particularly in sensitive sectors such as banking, require the highest

standards of honesty and integrity. Soza J. in National Savings Bank v.

Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union [1982] 2 Sri L.R 629 stated:

“the public have a right to expect a high standard of honesty in persons

employed in a bank and bank authorities have a right to insist that their

employees should observe a high standard of honesty; this is an implied

condition of service in a bank.”

Dishonesty in such roles undermines the employer’s confidence and directly

affects the employment relationship. Labour Tribunals, under Section 31C of

the Industrial Disputes Act, must inquire into all relevant matters and make

an order that is just and equitable. Appellate courts must evaluate procedural

compliance, evidence, and the reasonableness of the employer’s actions but

should not substitute their own judgment unless the termination is arbitrary or

legally unsound.

Procedural fairness must be observed, but it cannot override substantive justice.

Where a misconduct is clearly established, a technically imperfect procedure

does not invalidate a justified termination. Courts have consistently held that,

particularly in cases involving dishonesty, substantive proof of misconduct

outweighs minor procedural lapses.

Soza J. in National Savings Bank v. Ceylon Bank Employees’ Union [1982]

2 Sri L.R 629 stated,

10

“Whether the misconduct relates to the discharge of his duties in the bank or

not, if it reflects on the bankman’s honesty, it renders him unfit to serve in a

bank and justifies dismissal.”

In Kalik v Truworths (Gateway) and Others [2008], 1 BLLR (LC) the Labour

Court held that an employment relationship,

“….broken down as a result of an act of dishonesty can never be restored by

whatever amount of mitigation. The underlying reason for this approach is

that an employer cannot be expected to keep dishonest workers in his/her

employ. The other reason for this is to send an unequivocal message to other

employees that dishonesty will not be tolerated.”

Loss of confidence is a distinct and recognised legal principle in employment law.

Where a conduct of the employee undermines the trust essential to the

employment relationship, the employer may lawfully terminate the employee. In

The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd – Lake House v. M.S.P.

Nanayakkara SC Appeal No. 223/2016 (SC Minutes of 28.01.2022), His

Lordship Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere, endorsing the approach in Kosgolle

Gedara Greeta Shirani Wanigasinghe v Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian

Research and Training Institute SC Appeal No. 73/2014 (SC Minutes

02.09.2015), reaffirmed that trust is a core element of the employer–employee

relationship. His Lordship emphasised that an employee must always serve the

employer with honesty and integrity, without breaching the trust placed in him

or her, and in a manner that sustains the employer’s confidence. The following

extract from the same judgment is directly applicable to the present dispute:

“I must, however, add a word of caution. An employer cannot, merely to justify

the termination of the services of an employee, claim that he has lost

confidence in an employee. As pointed out by this Court in Bank of America

v Abeygunasekara (1991) 1 Sri LR 317 at page 328), ‘the mere assertion

by an employer is not sufficient to justify the termination of a workman on the

11

ground of loss of confidence. When such an assertion is made it is incumbent

on the Labour Tribunal to consider whether the allegation is well founded.

Therefore it would become necessary for the employer to lead evidence of facts

from which such an assertion could be proved directly or inferentially.’”

Amerasinghe J., in Premadasa Rodrigo v Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

(1991) 2 Sri LR 382 at pages 392–393, observed that:

“an employer cannot claim to have a right to dismiss an employee merely

because he says he has lost confidence in an employee.”

The Supreme Court in The Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd – Lake

House v. M.S.P. Nanayakkara SC Appeal No. 223/2016, also referring to

Premadasa Rodrigo case, held:

“Whether an employer has lost confidence in an employee is a matter

that must be determined on the facts and circumstances of each case,

with factors such as the incident or breach of discipline that gave rise

to the loss of confidence, and the position held by the employee being

relevant factors in arriving at such determination.”

Comparative jurisdiction also supports a strict approach to dishonesty involving

qualifications. The Labour Appeal Court in South Africa has consistently

followed an approach laid out early in the jurisprudence of the Labour Court in

Standard Bank SA Limited v CCMA and Others [1998] 6 BLLR 622 (LC) at

paragraphs 38-41 where Tip AJ said:

“It was one of the fundamentals of the employment relationship that the

employer should be able to place trust in the employee… A breach of this

trust in the form of conduct involving dishonesty is one that goes to the heart

of the employment relationship and is destructive of it.”

12

Courts have consistently taken a strict approach where employees misrepresent

qualifications or any material fact crucial to the employer’s business. In

Department of Home Affairs & another v Ndlovu & others(2014) 35 ILJ

3340 (LAC), the employee misrepresented in his CV that he had a degree in

technology marketing. While the Labour Court initially found the dismissal

unfair on review, the Labour Appeal Court reversed the decision and upheld the

dismissal. The LAC held:

“The fact that the misrepresentation in the CV might very well not have

induced the first respondent’s appointment to the post most certainly does

not detract from the fact of the first respondent’s initial dishonesty. The

dishonesty as contained in the CV is ultimately what underpins the

substantive fairness of the first respondent’s dismissal. Why did the first

respondent put in his CV that which is untrue? He knew how to describe

MBA degree which was then unfinished. He could have described the

Bachelor of Technology Marketing Degree similarly if he found it necessary

to mention it at all in his CV. John Grogan in his work Dismissal, (Juta & Co.

Ltd First published 2010, republished 2012) says the following about

dishonesty at page 188):

“‘Dishonesty’ is a generic term embracing all forms of conduct

involving deception on the part of employees. In criminal law, a person

cannot be convicted of dishonest conduct unless that conduct

amounts to a recognized offence. However, in the employment law, a

premium is placed on honesty because conduct involving moral

turpitude by employees damages the trust relationship on which the

contract is founded. The dishonest conduct of employees need not

therefore constitute a criminal offence. “Dishonesty” can consist of

any act or omission which entails deceit. This may include

withholding information from the employer, or making a false

statement or misrepresentation with the intention of deceiving the

employer…”

13

The Respondent was terminated on the ground that he submitted a false A/L

certificate. The Appellant Bank obtained independent confirmations from the

Principal of Isipathana College, where the Respondent studied, and from the

Certificate Branch of the Department of Examinations. Both authorities

confirmed that the certificate submitted was not genuine. The Respondent

denied submitting a false certificate. However, mere denial is insufficient to rebut

official confirmations provided by competent authorities. The evidence clearly

demonstrates that the Bank had reasonable grounds to conclude that the

Respondent engaged in gross misconduct.

It is noted that the Bank had previously issued a show-cause letter and

suspended the Respondent in relation to other allegations. While the High Court

and Labour Tribunal emphasised that the certificate marked R22 was not the

exact document submitted by the Respondent, the substance of the evidence

establishes that the certificate representing his qualifications was false. The

Respondent has failed to produce the original certificate or any evidence proving

its genuineness. Therefore, the Bank’s reliance on official confirmations and

documentary evidence was reasonable and justified.

Procedural fairness was observed to the extent required by law. The Respondent

had previously been given the opportunity to respond to allegations relating to

other misconduct, and the Bank conducted an internal verification before taking

action. The High Court criticised the Bank for not holding a separate disciplinary

inquiry specifically regarding the certificate. The Respondent’s misconduct,

which was the submission of false qualifications, was clearly established through

independent verification. The Bank relied on credible and substantial evidence

in taking its decision.

The Appellant Bank produced letters and documents evidencing misconduct,

including R15 and R17. These show prior suspensions, show-cause notices, and

disciplinary inquiry procedures initiated against the Respondent. R17, the show-

cause letter dated 23rd April 2012, specifically details serious misconduct

14

relating to borrowing money from a customer, providing false information

regarding a bank account, and refusing to hand over original documents during

the investigation. The letter warned the Respondent that disciplinary action,

including termination, could be taken:

“By conducting yourself in this manner, you have behaved in a manner

unbecoming of an employee of this Bank, with resultant loss of trust

and confidence reposed in you.”

The inquiry aimed to examine documents, statements and explanations

submitted by the Respondent, including his submissions regarding alleged

repayments to Mr.Buddhika Lakmal Wijesekera and cheque discrepancies.

Crucially, Yuraj Indrajith Vithanage (witness) testified regarding the central

issue of the alleged false A/L certificate. He confirmed that the Bank first

sought verification from the Principal of Isipathana College and then from

the Certificate Branch of the Department of Examinations. As he stated:

Vithanage(witness) further clarified that the principal reason for termination

under letter R33a was:

15

“ආර්.33.ඒ. හල්ලඛනහයන් ඔහුහේ හස්වය ලඝු හලස අවසන් කිරීමට ප්‍රධාන කරුණ වූහේ…

These statements show that the Bank relied on independent and authoritative

sources to verify the Respondent’s A/L certificate before taking the decision to

terminate his services. The Respondent denied submitting a false certificate, but

he did not produce the original certificate or any other evidence to prove that the

document he submitted was genuine.

Evaluation of High Court Reasoning

The High Court upheld the Labour Tribunal’s decision on three primary bases:

1. R22 was not conclusively proved to be the exact certificate submitted,

2. No officer involved in the investigation testified, and

3. The Respondent was not afforded an opportunity to respond specifically to

the false certificate allegation.

These points do not diminish the substantive evidence. The independent

confirmations from Isipathana College and the Department of Examinations

constitute direct proof that the certificate was false. The absence of testimony

from the investigating officer does not undermine the documentary evidence

relied upon. Minor procedural shortcomings cannot outweigh clear and serious

misconduct that destroys trust. The High Court erred in giving precedence to

procedural technicalities over substantive proof. Substantive justice requires

recognition that the Respondent engaged in gross misconduct.

16

Conclusion

In light of the evidence and applicable law, it is clear that the Respondent

submitted a false A/L certificate. The Bank, as an employer in a position of public

trust, was justified in losing confidence in the Respondent. Termination of his

services was lawful, reasonable, and proportionate.

Accordingly, the judgment of the High Court dated17.01.2019 and the Order of

the Labour Tribunal dated25.01.2018 are set aside and the decision of the

Appellant Bank to terminate the Respondent’s services is upheld as lawful,

reasonable, and justified.

I answer all the questions of law on which leave has been granted in the

affirmative.
