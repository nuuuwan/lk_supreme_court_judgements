As at the time this Application was filed, the construction was underway. (This Court has been notified that construction has been completed by this point.) The primary complaint of the Petitioners stems from the fact that they have not been assigned shops in the proposed public market building, and that such shops have been awarded to certain \u2018outsiders\u2019 who are presently not carrying-on businesses in the existing public market. To facilitate the construction of the new market building, twelve shops in the existing public market had to be demolished, and the traders who occupied those twelve shops have been offered alternative shops in the new proposed public market. The Petitioners have been informed by the 1st Respondent that, following the construction of the proposed public market, the building in which the present public market is situated will be demolished, paving the way for the construction of phase III of the proposed public market. At a discussion held with the 1st Respondent on or about 26th August 2020, the Petitioners have been informed that, should they be willing to pay Rs. 3 million each, the 1st Respondent was willing to reserve shops for them in the proposed public market (phase III). The Petitioners claim that they are not in a position to pay that sum of money. They have thus informed their inability and disagreement to pay Rs. 3 million",

As held time and again by this Court, including in the Judgments such as N.C. Gajaweera and Others v. Prof. Siri Hettige and Others [SC/FR Application No. 14/2017, SC Minutes of 20th March 2024], K.W.S.P. Jayawardhana v.

State Minister of Home Affairs and Others [SC/FR Application No. 112/2021, SC Minutes of 29th May 2025], an applicable law governing a certain procedure to be followed is stipulated for the sole purpose of affording an equal opportunity to every person governed by such applicable law. Therefore, strict compliance with such applicable law is necessary to safeguard fairness and equal protection before the law. Therefore, given the fact that Leave to Proceed has been granted under Article 12(1) of the Constitution, for the purpose of determining whether the Petitioners\u2019 Fundamental right to the equal protection of the law has been infringed by the 1st Respondent by adopting the procedure it did in the allocation of shop premises in the proposed new public market of Kurunegala, and not having allocated shop premises to the Petitioners, it would be necessary to audit the procedure followed by the 1st Respondent (KMC) against the procedure stipulated in \u201cR22\u201d / \u201cR23\u201d being the applicable and governing law. 18) To the extent relevant to this matter, \u201cR22\u201d / \u201cR23\u201d can be summarised in the",

In such instances, even traders of the old market should participate in submitting tenders. Ordinarily, shop premises should be assigned to the highest bids. However, if the relevant local government institution is convinced that the market can be maintained in a profitable manner, shop premises should be assigned to traders of the old complex at an amount which is the higher amount between a) the amount calculated by discounting an amount not exceeding 20% from the highest bid received, and b) the amount bid by the respective trader.
