SC/APPEAL/51/2022

Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiffs instituted this action against the Defendants in the District

Court of Kandy seeking a declaration of title to the land described in the

schedule to the plaint, namely Lot 7 in Plan No. 649 marked P2, cancellation

of Deed No. 515 marked P16 by which the 1st Defendant purported to

transfer the said Lot to the 2ⁿᵈ Defendant, a direction for the removal of the

corresponding entries in the Land Registry relating to the registration of

that deed, and damages. The Defendants filed answer seeking dismissal of

the Plaintiffs’ action and, in addition, a declaration that the 2ⁿᵈ Defendant

is the lawful owner of the said Lot. After trial, the learned District Judge

entered judgment for the Plaintiffs, except for damages. On appeal, the High

Court of Civil Appeal of Kandy affirmed the judgment of the District Court.

This appeal by the Defendants is against the judgment of the High Court.

It is common ground that Plan No. 649 is the final partition plan prepared

in Partition Case No. P 4976 of the District Court of Kandy. In terms of the

final decree of partition marked P1, Lot 7, together with part of house H5,

was allotted to the plaintiff in that case, namely Ram Menike. Ram Menike

thereafter transferred “an undivided portion of six lahas paddy sowing out

of all that divided portion of Lot marked 7”, together with “part of house H5

in Lot 6”, to Madduma Banda by Deed No. 3612 marked P3.

Thereafter, Ram Menike and Madduma Banda executed Deed of Transfer

No. 1403 marked P15 in favour of the 1ˢᵗ Defendant. The central question

that arises is whether, by this deed, Ram Menike and Madduma Banda

transferred only house H5 and the land covered thereby together with the

road reservation of approximately four perches (as described in Schedule 1

to the deed), or whether they also transferred Lot 7 (as described in

Schedule 3 to the deed). The land described in Schedule 2 to the deed is Lot

6.

SC/APPEAL/51/2022

Both the District Court and the High Court held that what was transferred

by Deed P15 was only house H5 and the land covered thereby together with

the road reservation, as described in Schedule 1, and that Lots 6 and 7,

described respectively in Schedules 2 and 3, were included merely to

properly identify and explain the subject matter of the transfer set out in

Schedule 1.

I have no hesitation in accepting this as the correct interpretation of Deed

P15. What was conveyed by that deed was house H5 and the land covered

thereby, together with the road reservation, as described in Schedule 1.

House H5 and the road reservation providing access to Lot 7 are situated

within Lot 6. In order to clearly identify and contextualise the property

conveyed, the Notary has described both Lot 6 and Lot 7. This intention is

made explicit by the wording at the end of Schedule 1, where the Notary

states “from and out of the following”, before proceeding to describe Lots 6

and 7 in the second and third schedules respectively.

If the Defendants’ argument is correct, it would necessarily follow that Ram

Menike and Madduma Banda also transferred Lot 6 to the 1ˢᵗ Defendant by

Deed P15. However, the Defendants themselves do not advance such a case.

On the contrary, the 2ⁿᵈ Defendant, in his evidence, expressly accepted that

under the final decree of partition, Lot 6 was allotted to his father,

Abeyratna Banda, and that they are in possession of that Lot on the basis

of their father’s title.

Accordingly, the question of law on which leave to appeal was granted

namely, whether the District Court and the High Court erred in law by

failing to consider that house H5 and the road reservation depicted in Plan

No. 649 form part of Lot 7, is answered in the negative.

The judgment of the High Court is affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed

with costs.
