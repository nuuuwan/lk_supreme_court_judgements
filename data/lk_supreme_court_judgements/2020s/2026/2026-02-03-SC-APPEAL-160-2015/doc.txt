COUNSEL: Geeshan Rodrigo instructed by Buddhika Gamage for the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant

W. Dayaratne PC with Rajika Jayawardene instructed by Mrs C. Dayaratne for the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent. WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS: By the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant on

28.05.2025. By the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent on 05.09.2024. ARGUED ON: 24.06.2025 DECIDED ON: 03.02.2026 K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J. This is an appeal from a judgment of the Provincial High Court of the North

Western Province (Civil Appeals), dated 29.01.2015 which set aside the

judgment of the District Court of Kurunegala case bearing No: 5853/L dated

28.12.2009.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the “Appellant”)

along with the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

1st Plaintiff) instituted the initial action before the District Court of Kurungela

against the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

“Respondent”) seeking a declaration of Title to the land morefully described in

the schedule of the plaint, ejectment, damages and for an order for deposit

money in court alleged to be borrowed by the Respondent.

The Respondent stated that there had been a transaction by the Respondent,

with the Appellant similar to what is related in the plaint, which is alleged to

be regard to the land described in the schedule of the answer and in which

the boundaries have not been described in relation to a plan. According to the

Respondent, the transaction mentioned therein is alleged to be a transfer of

4

property without any formal document and that an advance of Rs. 100,000/-

had been paid by the Respondent and an amount of Rs. 50,000/- was to be

paid at the execution of a formal document which had never happened.

Therefore had prayed for a dismissal of Appellants action, declaration on

prescription and in the alternative to recover the money lent to the Appellant

and for damages for improvements.

The Appellant filed replication to meet the said cross claim and denied the

same. The matter was taken up for trial on 19.02.2003. The Learned District

Court Judge thereafter delivered the judgment in favour of the Appellant.

Aggrieved by which the Respondent appealed to the Provincial High Court of

the North Western Province. The Learned High Court Judge after considering

the oral submissions and the written submissions of the parties, decided in

favour of the Respondent, setting aside the judgment of the District Court

holding that the Appellants had failed to establish title to the said Lot 45,

failed to identify the said Lot 45 on the land and failed to show that the

Respondent is in the that Lot 45.

Aggrieved by the said judgment the Appellant is before this Court challenging

the judgement of the Provincial High Court of the North Western Province

(hearing civil appeals). This Court by Order dated 22.09.2015, granted Leave

to Appeal on the questions of law stated 13 (a to e) of the Petition dated

09.03.2015, as set out below.

(a) Did the Provincial High Court err by failing to correctly apply the

principles of law relating to declaration of title, in relation to a crown

grant.

(b) Did the Provincial High Court err by coming to the conclusion that the

Petitioners have not identified the land by way of a plan, whereas the

learned Judges referred to a definite lot in the Government Plan.

(c) The Learned Judges in the Provincial High Court have not realised by

allowing the appeal, not only the Plaintiffs action been dismissed but

5

also declared that the Respondent is the owner of the crown land,

without any document at all.

(d) The right of a beneficiary of a crown grant in terms of the Land

Development Ordinance had been totally disregarded by the Learned

Judge in deciding the matter in favour of the Respondent.

(e) The Learned Judges have totally disregarded the documentary proof led

in evidence, especially P4.

My analysis hereafter will be confined to examining the aforesaid questions of

law based on which leave was granted.

The first matter for consideration by this court is “Did the Provincial High

Court err by failing to correctly apply the principles of law relating to

declaration of title, in relation to a crown grant.” This question of law is

considered together with the second question of law, namely: “Did the

Provincial High Court err by coming to the conclusion that the

Petitioners have not identified the land by way of a plan, whereas the

learned Judges referred to a definite lot in the Government Plan”.

Turning to the facts of the instant case, one Hikaduwa Liyanage Wijepala, had

been the beneficiary of a grant under section 19(4) of the Land Development

Ordinance and after his death in terms of the said ordinance the Appellant is

the life interest holder and the 1st Plaintiff had been the nominee of such

permit, which was followed by a grant in his favour by the District Secretariat.

The 1st Plaintiff who is the son of Hikaduwa Liyanage Wijepala has been

named as the 1st Plaintiff as he is presently overseas.

The Respondent is alleged to have given out a loan for a portion of money

required by the Appellant for an emergency which was paying alimony for

divorce, without any formal documentation. In lieu of the interest component

for the abovementioned loan, the possession of the land in question had been

handed over to the Respondent by the Appellant. However, when the

Appellant wanted to settle the debt, the Respondent had refused to vacate the

said land.

6

It is the Respondents contention that the land in issue is not a state land and

is in close proximity to the state land in which the Appellant lives. Further,

there was no commission by the Appellant to identify the land to eject the

Respondent if they succeed for a judgment in their favour. The Respondent

further stated that this was made clear by the fact that the Appellant could

not give a valid answer when questioned about the boundaries (Vide page

162). The Respondent further stated that he has spent a considerable sum in

improving the land and building including repairs of the dilapidated house

and cultivating the land.

In considering the legal regime governing declarations of title in respect of

Crown land alienated under the Land Development Ordinance, it is first

necessary to appreciate the nature of the interest conferred by the State upon

an alienee. State land is held by the State as sovereign, and any occupation

or enjoyment by private persons arises exclusively through statutory

mechanisms established under the Ordinance. In terms of Section 19(2) of

the LDO, a person does not initially acquire ownership; rather, he receives a

permit authorising occupation, subject to fulfilment of instalments,

development conditions, and compliance with the terms endorsed by the

Government Agent.

A permit-holder is therefore not an owner at general law, but a statutory

occupier with restricted and conditional rights. Only upon satisfaction of the

statutory conditions enumerated in Section 19(4) does the State issue a grant,

at which point the alienee becomes the “owner” of the “holding” within the

special meaning assigned by Section 2. Even then, the ownership conferred

remains circumscribed by prohibitions on subdivision, restrictions on

alienation, and the special regime of succession established in Chapter VII of

the LDO.

The jurisprudence of the Supreme Court has consistently affirmed that the

title conveyed by a permit or grant must be understood within the structure

of the Ordinance. In Palisena v. Perera [1954] 56 NLR 407 the Court held

that the interest of a permit-holder is sufficient to maintain a rei vindicatio

7

against a trespasser, notwithstanding that the full rights of ownership under

the general law are absent.

This principle was reiterated in Bandaranayake v. Karunawathi [2003] 3

SLR 295 and relied upon by Justice Sisira de Abrew in K.A.Chandralatha v

Keeralage Parakrama SC Appeal 188/2011 decided on 18.07.2018,

where His Lordship held that a permit-holder, once identification of the

corpus and the validity of the permit are established, possesses standing to

vindicate the land against an encroacher. The Court emphasised that the

State’s grant of a permit, coupled with compliance with the statutory metes-

and-bounds description required under Section 41 of the Civil Procedure

Code, suffices to constitute “title” for the limited purposes of maintaining such

an action.

However, while this statutory title suffices to maintain an action for ejectment

of a trespasser, this Court has drawn a firm distinction between (a) a

declaration confirming the plaintiff as the lawful permit-holder or successor

under the LDO, and

(b) a declaration of ownership of the corpus, which remains State land unless

and until a grant is issued.

This distinction is articulated with clarity in Kalanchige Chandralatha v

Iddagoda Hewage Somasiri and Others SC/HCCA/LA 87/2020 decided

on 02.07.2025, where Justice Janak de Silva held that although a plaintiff

who proves entitlement under a permit and where relevant, succession under

Section 68, may be granted relief by way of restoration of possession, such a

plaintiff cannot obtain a declaration of “title to the corpus” as owner, “which is

admittedly state land granted on a permit”.

The Court relied on Attorney General v. Herath [1960] 62 NLR 145 to affirm

that full ownership necessarily includes jus utendi, jus fruendi and jus

abutendi; since a permit-holder (and even a grantee) enjoys these rights only

within limitations, the classical notion of ownership cannot be attributed to

them. In the same vein, the Court cited the reasoning in Jinawathie v.

8

Emalin Perera [1986] 2 SLR 121, observing that the LDO structure does not

contemplate conferral of unfettered dominion over State land.

Thus, in cases involving Crown land alienated under a permit, courts may

properly make declarations that a plaintiff is the lawful permit-holder or

lawful successor nominated in accordance with Chapter VII, provided such

succession was pleaded, proved, and registered in compliance with Sections

56–60. However, courts cannot proceed to declare that the plaintiff is the

“owner” of the land when the land continues to vest in the State and the

plaintiff has received no grant under Section 19(4). To do so would contradict

the scheme of the Ordinance and would incorrectly elevate a conditional

statutory right of occupation into full dominion under the general law.

In the resolution of disputes concerning Crown grants, courts also construe

the nature of competing possession. K.A.Chandralatha v Keeralage

Parakrama SC Appeal 188/2011 decided on 18.07.2018 makes clear that

an encroacher upon Crown land alienated on a permit cannot acquire

prescriptive title under Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, since

possession with a “secret and dishonest intention” is not adverse within the

meaning of the statute. The judgment affirms the longstanding principles

articulated in Corea v. Appuhamy [1911] 15 NLR 65 and Gunawardene v.

Samarakoon [1958] 60 NLR 481, extending their reasoning to trespassers

upon State land by holding that clandestine or unlawful possession can never

mature into prescriptive ownership against a permit-holder or the State.

Accordingly, when a plaintiff establishes the validity of the permit and

identifies the land in accordance with statutory requirements, the court must

both (a) declare that the plaintiff is the lawful permit-holder, and (b) order

ejectment of the encroacher.

The consequence of these principles is that in actions concerning Crown

grants and lands held under the LDO, the scope of declarations the court may

grant is carefully confined.

9

A court may:

(1)Declare that the plaintiff is the lawful permit-holder, or lawful

successor entitled under Chapter VII;

(2) Affirm the validity of the permit or grant;

(3) Order ejectment of trespassers or encroachers; and

(4) Restore possession to the statutory holder.

However, unless and until a grant has been issued under Section 19(4), the

court may not declare that the plaintiff is the owner of the corpus. The State

remains the sovereign owner, and courts cannot, through declaratory relief,

bypass the statutory conditions for alienation established by Parliament.

The law recognises a special form of statutory title under the Land

Development Ordinance which allows a permit-holder or properly constituted

successor to vindicate possession, but does not entitle such person to a

judicial declaration of absolute ownership of Crown land. The jurisdiction of

the court is therefore confined to affirming rights granted under the

Ordinance, nothing more, nothing less and all declarations must reflect the

carefully delineated hierarchy between State ownership and statutorily

conferred occupational rights.

When the facts of this matter is considered against the applicable statutory

framework under the Land Development Ordinance and the principles

governing identification in a rei vindicatio action, the High Court placed strong

reliance on alleged inconsistencies in boundary identification. The High Court

noted that the Appellant did not mechanically recite the boundaries exactly

as they appeared in the grant (Vide page 97), had not commissioned a fresh

survey (Vide page 100), and referred to “30 perches” although the Government

Plan referred to 0.095 hectares (Vide page 102). The High Court further

emphasised the evidence of the Land Officer, who admitted that he had not

visited the land (Vide pages 122, 129) and could not confirm whether the

Appellant was physically positioned within Lot 45 of Final Plan 1261. From

these matters the High Court concluded that the Appellant had (i) not

established title, (ii) failed to identify the land, and (iii) not proved that the

10

Respondent was in Lot 45. That court relied heavily on Latheef and Another

v Mansoor and Another [2011] BLR 189 to stress that a plaintiff must fail

if he cannot prove identification, irrespective of whether the defendant’s case

collapses.

However, the District Court Judge did not merely rely on the limitations of the

Respondent’s case. Rather, the District Judge correctly appreciated the

nature of the Appellant’s entitlement as one derived from a grant issued under

Section 19(4) of the LDO. A grant issued under that Section confers a

statutory title recognised by law and, as reaffirmed in Kalanchige

Chandralatha v Iddagoda Hewage Somasiri and others SC/HCCA/LA

87/2020 decided on 02.07.2025, does not require the Appellant to establish

absolute ownership under the general law. The District Court correctly held

that where land is State land alienated under the LDO, the inquiry into title

does not involve the classical tripartite rights of ownership; rather, the court’s

question is whether the Appellant has the statutory entitlement to possession

superior to that of the Respondent. On that basis, identification is often

satisfied by credible evidence reflective of Government Plans, boundary

features, the evidence of State officers, and possession consistent with the

grant.

Thus, although the High Court faulted the Appellant for not repeating

boundaries verbatim or commissioning a new survey, the District Court Judge

correctly observed that the land was adequately identified through the

reference to the northern road boundary, which is a clear and permanent

physical marker recognised by courts as sufficient for identification under

Section 41 of the Civil Procedure Code. The District Judge further relied

on the testimony of the Land Officer, who, despite not having visited the

precise spot, nevertheless confirmed that the parcel described by the

Appellant and occupied by the Respondent lay within State land alienated

under the LDO. In cases involving Crown land, the testimony of the State’s

own land officer, corroborating the Appellant’s description and confirming the

State character of the land, is significantly probative. The High Court erred in

11

dismissing this evidence entirely merely because the officer had not stepped

onto the land himself.

Moreover, the District Court correctly considered that the Respondent had not

only admitted in a Section 66 application that the land was State land and

that any sale required Divisional Secretary approval, but had also attempted

to take the benefit of an unenforceable transaction, one explicitly nullified

under Section 46 LDO and unenforceable under the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance. Such conduct goes directly to the Respondent’s reliability when

describing the identity or location of the land.

Finally, the High Court misapplied Latheef v Mansoor. That authority affirms

that a plaintiff must independently establish his claim in a rei vindicatio,

irrespective of deficiencies in the defendant’s case; however, it does not elevate

the requirement of identification to a rigid technical ritual where the plaintiff’s

statutory entitlement is affirmed by Government records and official

testimony. In the present matter, the Appellant’s case was supported by the

crown grant, the Government Plan, the Divisional Secretary’s confirmation,

the identification of the northern road boundary, and the evidence of the Land

Officer regarding the State’s ownership and succession record. The District

Court correctly did not rely on the Respondent’s contradictions to “supply”

proof of title, but relied on the Appellant’s statutory grant, the Government

Plan, the identification of the road boundary, and the testimony of the State

land officer. All these elements together constitute sufficient identification in

a rei vindicatio involving Crown land.

For these reasons, I am of the view that the District Court Judge correctly

held that the Appellant had established entitlement, properly identified the

land, and proved that the defendant was in unlawful occupation. The District

Court’s judgment rests on firm statutory footing and accords fully with the

established jurisprudence on State land under the Land Development

Ordinance and I am inclined to agree with the reasoning of the Learned

District Court Judge. The High Court’s contrary findings rested on an

12

incorrect elevation of technical omissions and a failure to appreciate the

statutory character of the land and the Appellant’s title under the LDO.

I will be considering the remaining three questions of law on which leave has

been granted together due to their similar nature. Namely that “The Learned

Judges in the Provincial High Court have not realised by allowing the

appeal, not only the Plaintiffs action been dismissed but also declared

that the Respondent is the owner of the crown land, without any

document at all.”, “The right of a beneficiary of a crown grant in terms

of the Land Development Ordinance had been totally disregarded by the

Learned Judge in deciding the matter in favour of the Respondent.” and

“The Learned Judges have totally disregarded the documentary proof led

in evidence, especially P4.”

The law relating to succession to land alienated under the Land Development

Ordinance (“LDO”) constitutes a closed and comprehensive statutory code,

expressly displacing all other systems of succession pursuant to Section 170.

Such land is initially alienated by permit, and upon fulfilment of the

conditions prescribed in Section 19(2), the State is compelled to issue a grant

under Section 19(4). Accordingly, a nomination of a successor validly made

under the permit automatically carries over and becomes the nomination of

the “owner” upon issuance of the grant.

The LDO establishes a hierarchical system of succession anchored in Sections

48A, 48B, 49, 51, 52–67, 68 and 72, read with Rules 1 and 2 of the Third

Schedule. The statutory point of departure is the superior right of the

surviving spouse. Under Sections 48A and 48B, the spouse of a deceased

permit-holder or grantee succeeds automatically, even if not nominated, and

irrespective of arrears. This succession is subject to strict statutory

limitations: the spouse may not dispose of the land or nominate successors,

save where the spouse was expressly nominated by the deceased. Only upon

the failure of the spouse to succeed, defined in Section 68(1) as refusal or

failure to enter possession within six months, does the nominated successor’s

right arise.

13

Where a nomination exists, Section 49 gives primacy to the nominated

successor, who becomes entitled upon the death of the permit-holder or

owner, subject only to the prior right of the spouse. However, this entitlement

itself is conditional: the nominated successor must enter possession within

six months; failure or refusal triggers the statutory consequence of “failure to

succeed” under Section 68(2).

Where no valid nomination exists, or where the nomination is unlawful (for

example, naming a person outside the permitted class under Section 51), or

where a nominated successor fails to succeed, the land devolves by operation

of law under Section 72, which incorporates the order of priority in Rule 1 of

the Third Schedule. The pre-2022 hierarchy favoured sons over daughters,

but Act No. 11 of 2022 removed gender-preferential succession, establishing

a revised order: children; grandchildren; parents; siblings; uncles and aunts;

nephews and nieces, with the older preferred over the younger. Crucially, Rule

1(d) requires that, where a member of a class has developed the land, the right

devolves upon the developer, even if younger. This statutory hierarchy

operates only upon the failure of both spouse and nominated successor, and

not in parallel with them.

The LDO permits nomination of successors but also allows cancellation and

replacement of nominations, as regulated in Sections 52–67 of the LDO,

provided the nomination is made in the prescribed form and registered under

Section 58. A nomination not registered is invalid. The Act is, however, silent

on renunciation of rights by a statutory successor.

One of the most significant procedural safeguards is that no disposition of a

permit or holding is valid without prior written approval of the Divisional

Secretary or Government Agent, as mandated by Sections 19(6), 19(7) and 46.

Any purported transfer, pledge, sale, or agreement made in violation of these

provisions is null and void, and does not affect the chain of statutory

succession.

Justice Mahinda Samayawardhena in W.M. Dhanapala Menike v

Dayananda Colombage and Others SC Appeal 166/2017 decided on

14

09.11.2023 reaffirmed that succession to land alienated under the Land

Development Ordinance is governed exclusively by the statutory scheme in

Chapter VII, and that no other law of succession has any application. The

Court emphasised that the rights of the spouse, the nominated successor,

and those entitled under Rule 1 of the Third Schedule arise strictly in the

sequence prescribed by the Act, and that succession must follow the

mandatory statutory pathway rather than any private arrangement or

extraneous legal doctrine. In particular, successors, whether spouse,

nominee, or statutory heir, must enter possession within six months, failing

which they are deemed to have failed to succeed, thereby divesting their

entitlement and activating the next tier of succession.

The Court’s pronouncement concerned the exclusivity of the LDO’s

succession code, stating: “In terms of section 170… no other law relating to

succession of land is applicable in respect of any land alienated under this

Ordinance.” This principle renders private deeds, informal renunciations, and

external succession doctrines without effect. Once the statutory conditions

for devolution are met, whether through spouse, nomination, or operation of

law, the Act alone determines entitlement, and succession occurs

automatically and conclusively within the four corners of the Ordinance.

Turning to the facts of the instant case, Hikaduwa Liyanage Wijepala was the

beneficiary of the grant under section 19(4) of the Land Development

Ordinance and following his death, on request of the Appellant who is the life

interest holder and the 1st Plaintiff who was his son, the 1st Plaintiff had been

named the nominee of such permit issued by the Divisional Secretariat.

During the course of the trial the Appellant marked the crown grant, a letter

dated 14.06.2000 issued by the Divisional Secretary Kurunegala vesting the

land described in the said crown grant to the 1st Plaintiff as P4 and the

Preliminary plan dated 07.12.1985 as P6. The Appellant called the land officer

attached to the Divisional Secretariat to prove the abovementioned

documents. The Land Officer stated in evidence that the grant in question did

15

not have a nominee; however, in the permit a nominee had been named, which

was the 1st Plaintiff.

The District Court concluded that (1) the land in dispute is government land

held under a grant to the late Wijepala (2) the Respondent’s affidavit P.8 (filed

in the Section 66 proceedings) admitting the land to be State land and

acknowledging the need for prior approval for sale fatally undermined his

contrary evidence in cross-examination; (3) no lawful prior written approval

under the Land Development Ordinance was produced and therefore any

asserted transfer or pledge was void under the statutory prohibition on

alienation; (4) the alleged improvements that were claimed to have been made

by the Respondent were unproved because no commission or assessment was

obtained; and (5) on the question of succession the widow (the 2nd plaintiff)

is the statutorily preferred person to succeed under the LDO and the son’s

claim cannot succeed while she remains alive and unmarried.

Measured against the statutory matrix, the District Judge accepted

contemporaneous administrative documentary evidence (the crown grant, the

Divisional Secretary’s endorsement and the preliminary plan) and rightly put

decisive weight on the Respondent’s own sworn concession in the Section 66

affidavit that the land was State land and that any sale required prior

approval, an admission that materially fortified the statutory presumption

that the land is held under the Ordinance and that any private “transfer”

lacking the written sanction of the Government Agent or Divisional Secretary

is void. That conclusion is compelled by Section 46 (and the companion

provisions in Chapter IV and VII) which render dispositions in breach of the

statutory regime null; it is reinforced by the jurisprudence that a permit-based

nomination, duly made and not revoked, remains effective and passes with

the grant.

The Respondent’s claim that P4 is invalid because the original grant does not

itself contain a nomination overlooks the operation of the Land Development

Ordinance, which treats the permit as the foundation of title and recognises

nominations made at the permit stage unless lawfully revoked. The High

16

Court’s characterisation of P4 as “neither a grant nor a permit” fails to consider

that the Ordinance vests in the Government Agent and Divisional Secretary

the statutory responsibility to determine, recognise, and record succession

upon the death of a permit-holder or grantee. This authority flows from

Sections 19(4), 48A, 48B, 52–67, 68 and 105, which collectively require the

prescribed officer to assess entitlement, determine whether the spouse,

nominated successor or statutory heir succeeds, and make the corresponding

entries in the official registers of permits and grants. P4, an official

communication dated 14.06.2000, expressly identifies Lot 45 of Final Plan

No. 1261, traces its original alienation to Wijepala, and records the Divisional

Secretary’s decision that, pursuant to the statutory scheme, the land “has

been transferred to the 1st Plaintiff.” Such a document is in substance a

statutory confirmation of succession, issued within the scope of the powers

conferred by the Ordinance.

The Court of Appeal held in Piyasena v Wijesinghe and Others [2002] 2 Sri

L R 242, “the nomination of a successor under the permit becomes converted

to nomination made by her as the owner of the land,” and “the issuance of a

grant changes the status of a permit holder to that of an ‘owner’ who derives

title to the land in question.”

The witness, S. H. R. Mudiyanse, the Land Officer attached to the Divisional

Secretariat, gave evidence confirming the administrative history of the land.

He stated that, according to the crown grant marked P1, the land originally

stood in the name of the late Wijepala, and that thereafter the Divisional

Secretariat had taken steps to process a transfer of inheritance in favour of

his son, Sudath Priyankara, the 1st Plaintiff. He explained that the relevant

documentation pertaining to this transfer was in the custody of the Divisional

Secretary and had been produced in these proceedings as P4. On that basis,

he testified that all procedural requirements had been completed and

arrangements were made to effect the transfer of Wijepala’s grant to the 1st

Plaintiff.

17

During cross-examination, however, the witness clarified that the nomination

reflected in the record was not one made by Wijepala during his lifetime.

Rather, he stated that the Appellant, the widow of Wijepala, together with

Wijepala’s child, the 1st Plaintiff, had jointly requested that a permit be issued

in the 1st Plaintiff's name, and it was pursuant to that collective request that

the permit was prepared.

Furthermore, the absence of the title “grant” or “permit” on P4 does not

undermine its legal validity. The Ordinance does not limit the prescribed

authority to only those forms but, under Section 105, requires the

maintenance of registers and the recording of all alterations and changes

related to permits and grants. Consequently, P4 serves as a valid record of

such a change, fulfilling the statutory duty of implementing succession under

Sections 48A, 48B, 68, and 72. This makes it clear that a nomination made

under the permit remains effective and seamlessly transitions upon the

issuance of the grant, reinforcing the appellant’s position that the permit-

based nomination suffices for succession. Accordingly, the District Judge

properly rejected any informal, post hoc claims of transfer or improvements

that lacked the necessary statutory approvals, thereby upholding the

statutory pathway of succession.

Accordingly, having applied the statutory text of the LDO and the controlling

authority in jurisprudence, and having considered the contemporaneous

administrative documents and the trial court’s credibility findings, the

District Judge’s conclusion that succession and entitlement devolved in

accordance with the Ordinance was legally sound; the High Court’s contrary

conclusion, which effectively declared ownership in the absence of the

statutory process and in disregard of the permit-borne nomination and the

respondent’s own admissions, cannot stand.

When considering all the above discussed circumstances, it is evident that

the Learned District Court Judge has come to the correct and rational

conclusion.

18

Having examined the facts of the case, and the material placed before this

court, I allow the appeal of the Appellant and uphold the judgement of the

District Court of Kurunegala. I set aside the Judgement of the Provincial High

Court of North Western Province (Civil Appeals).

I answer all the questions of law on which leave has been granted in the

affirmative.
