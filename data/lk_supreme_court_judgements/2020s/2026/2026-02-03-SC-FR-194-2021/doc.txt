ARGUED ON: 20th June 2025

DECIDED ON: 3rd February 2026

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. When the matter was taken up on 20th June 2025, parties in SC/FR/194/2021 and

SC/FR/281/2021 agreed that this judgment would be binding on both matters. On 8th

September 2021, leave to proceed was granted under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

2. The Petitioners are citizens of Sri Lanka serving in the Department of Customs, acting

full-time in the post of Director, Customs, belonging to the Grade II (Executive Grade)

of the Sri Lanka Customs Department.

3. The four Petitioners, namely, Kottewatte Hewage Dharmakeerthi, Upali Lokusooriya,

Abeyratne Pathirannahelage Nihal Abayaratne, and Jasentu Liayana Harsha Kumar

Jayatilake, invoked the fundamental rights jurisdiction of this Court. They contend, inter

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 22

alia, that their rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been

infringed by the manner in which the Public Service Commission (hereinafter referred to

as the ‘PSC’) and the Department of Customs interpreted and applied the provisions of

the Scheme of Recruitment 2009 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘SOR’), particularly the

requirements under Clause 10.2.1.2 and Clause 11, when making promotions from

Grade II to Grade I of the Executive Grade.

4. On 9th December 2009, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the Recruitment Procedure

for the Executive Service Category of Sri Lanka. Under this Scheme, the post of Director,

Customs is classified as a Grade I position. Section 10.2.1.2 of the Scheme sets out the

eligibility criteria for the promotion from Grade II to Grade I.

5. Clause 10.2.1.2 of the SOR stipulates four eligibility criteria for promotion from Grade II

to Grade I. The same is reproduced below for ease of reference:

I. A Postgraduate degree obtained from a University/institution recognized by the

University Grants Commission or, in the alternative for those who have joined the

service prior to 01.01.2006, a thesis of not less than 5000 words on a topic relevant

to the Customs service approved by a board appointed for the purpose by the

Director General of Customs;

II. Completion of seven (07) years of active service in Grade Il, earning all salary

increments;

III. Having a satisfactory period of service during the period of five (05) years

immediately preceding without having received any punishment for any disciplinary

reasons;

IV. Having received ratings of 'average' or 'above average' in appraisals during the

immediately preceding five (05) years;

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 22

6. The SOR contained an exception clause which provided that, where there were

insufficient officers in Grade II who satisfied all the above criteria, vacancies in Grade I

were to be filled based on seniority in Grade II together with active and satisfactory

service. The same is reproduced below for ease of reference:

“However, when there are vacancies in the post of Director, Customs and there isn’t

a sufficient number of officers appointed to Grade I if the SL1 salary scale, it should

be regarded as there is no alternative to fill such vacancies and officers in Grade II of

the SL1 salary scale qualify to be promoted to Grade I of SL1 salary scale based on

their seniority and period of active and satisfactory service.”

7. An internal memorandum dated 25th July 2016 [marked “17R-1”] informed all staff

officers, including the Petitioners, that a further grace period was being sought from the

PSC to complete the Master’s degree or thesis requirement under Condition No (I).

Officers were cautioned that if such grace period was not granted, those who had not

completed Condition No (I) would be ineligible for promotion to Executive Grade I, and

were urged to take steps to fulfil the requirement without delay.

8. Following a meeting with the PSC held on 12th October 2016, a further internal

memorandum dated 17th October 2016 [marked “17R-2”] notified all staff officers that

the requested grace period had been refused. It reiterated that only applications of

officers who completed Condition No (I) would be forwarded for promotion and directed

those intending to seek promotion to act immediately. This position was subsequently

formalised by an amendment to the Scheme of Recruitment in 2017 [marked “17R-3(a)”],

which exempted only the 1979 batch from Condition No (I), rendering it mandatory for

all subsequent batches, including the Petitioners. An additional internal memorandum

dated 1st June 2017 [marked “17R-3”] again reminded officers performing duties as

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 22

Acting Directors of Customs who had not yet been promoted to complete the

requirement promptly.

9. The Petitioners opted for the thesis route and submitted their theses between 2019 and

2020. They claim entitlement to Grade I promotion without loss of seniority, as no

officers had completed seven years in Grade II at the time of their acting appointments,

and they fulfilled the thesis requirement before juniors completed seven years.

10. On 11th June 2021, the PSC promoted the 13th to 31st Respondents (juniors to the

Petitioners) to Grade I with effect from dates between 2017 and 2020 [marked “P6”]. The

Petitioners allege that this overlooked their seniority, violating Article 12(1) of the

Constitution by unequal treatment.

11. The Respondents contend that the promotions were made under the SOR exception,

prioritising officers who first fulfilled the mandatory thesis/Master’s condition (Condition

No (I)), which the Petitioners delayed until 2020.

12. When this matter was taken up for hearing on 8th September 2021, the Respondents

raised three preliminary objections on the maintainability of the application as follows:

a) The Petitioners’ application is time-barred.

b) The Petitioners are guilty of suppression and misrepresentation of material facts

and lacks the uberrima fides.

c) The Petitioners have failed to include necessary parties to this application, and

therefore, the Petitioners’ application should be dismissed in limine.

13. I will proceed to consider the second preliminary objection relating to suppression and

misrepresentation of material facts, as it appears to be apparent on the face of the

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 22

record. If upheld, that alone would be a sufficient ground to dispose of the application

in limine.

Suppression and Misrepresentation of Material Facts

14. As noted, one of the objections taken by the Respondents was that the Petitioners have

gravely misled the court through misrepresentation and suppression of facts.

15. As Hector Yapa, J. held in Jayasinghe v. National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical

Engineering (NIFNE) and others [2002];1

“When a litigant makes an application to this Court seeking relief, he enters into a

contractual obligation with the Court. This contractual relationship requires the

petitioner to disclose all material facts correctly and frankly. This is a duty cast on

any litigant seeking relief from Court. In the case of Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Limited

v. Wilfred Van Els and Two Others [(1997) 1 Sri LR 360.] The Court highlighted this

contractual obligation which a party enters into with the Court, requiring the need

to disclose uberrima tides and disclose all material facts fully and frankly to Court.

Any party who misleads Court, misrepresents facts. To Court or utters falsehood in

Court will not be entitled to obtain redress from Court. It is a well-established

proposition of law, since Courts expect a party seeking relief to be frank and open

with the Court. This principle has been applied even in an application that has been

made to challenge a decision made without jurisdiction. Further, Court will not go

into the merits of the case in such situations. Vide Rex v. Kensington Income Tax

Commissioners; Princess Edmond De Polignac [(1917) 1 KB 486.]. This principle of

uberrima tides has been applied not only in writ cases where discretionary relief is

sought from Court, but even in Admiralty cases involving the grant of injunctions.”

1 [2002] 1 Sri L.R. 27, at p. 286.

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 22

16. In King v. The General Commissioners for the Purpose of the Income Tax Acts for

the District of Kensington – Ex parte Princess Edmond de Poignac [1917],2 an

application for a writ of prohibition was dismissed without consideration of the merits

on the ground that the applicant had suppressed and misrepresented material facts.

Scrutton L.J. emphasised the established practice of courts that when an applicant seeks

relief, “he should make a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts – facts, not law.

He must not misstate the law if he can help it – the court is supposed to know the law. But

it knows nothing about the facts, and the applicant must state fully and fairly the facts....”.3

17. When it was argued that this principle was confined to ex parte applications, Lord

Cozens-Hardy M.R. observed that,

“There are many cases in which the same principle would apply. The applicant

must come in the manner prescribed and must be perfectly frank and open with

the Court”.4

18. In Liyanage v. Ratnasiri [2013],5 this Court affirmed the position that an application

founded on such conduct is liable to be dismissed without entering into the merits. The

Court, relying on earlier authority, reiterated the settled position that judicial relief will

not be extended to a party who has failed to approach the Court in good faith. In this

regard, reference was made to Gas Conversions (Pvt) Ltd and 3 Others v. Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation and Others,6 where it was held that:

2 (1917) 1 K.B. 486.

3 Ibid, at p. 514.

4 Ibid, at p. 506.

5 [2013] 1 Sri L.R. 06, at p. 6.

6 Gas Conversions (Pvt) Ltd., and 3 others v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and others SC FR/91/2002, SC Minutes of 13th January 2003, at p. 4; See also W.S. Alphonso Appuhamy v. L. Hettiarachchige and another

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 22

“A series of judgments of our courts have enunciated the requirement of

complete disclosure and uberrima fides with regard to applications before Court.

It is now a well-established principle that when an applicant has suppressed or

misrepresented facts material to an application, and when there is no complete

and truthful disclosure of all material facts, the Court will not go into the merits

of the application but will dismiss it in limine…”

19. Furthermore, as was held in Liyanage v. Ratnasiri,7 “it is the paramount duty of the

petitioner to disclose all the relevant material facts truthfully.” The failure to discharge

this duty is therefore fatal to the maintainability of the present application.

20. In Abeywardene v. Inspector General of Police and Others [1991],8 Justice

Amerasinghe emphasised that a petitioner seeking just and equitable relief through the

Supreme Court’s fundamental rights jurisdiction must approach the Court with clean

hands.

21. Moreover, as per Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules (1990), a Special Leave to Appeal

application “Shall contain a plain and concise statement of all such facts and matters

necessary to enable the Supreme Court to determine whether the Special Leave to Appeal

should be granted”. By parity of reasoning, a fundamental rights application must

similarly place all essential facts before the Court to allow a proper determination of the

alleged infringement.

77 NLR 131; Fonseka v. Lt. General Jagath Jayasuriya and Five Others [2011] 2 Sri. L.R. 372; Ms. Kayleigh Frazer v. Priyantha Jayawardena SC FR 399/2022, SC Minutes of 10th September 2015.

7 [2013] 1 Sri. L.R. 06, at p. 17.

8 [1991] 2 Sri L.R. 349, at p. 381.

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 16 of 22

22. Admittedly, some of the cases Yapa, J. has referred to in Jayasinghe v. National

Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering (Supra),9 come from entirely different

contexts with distinct jurisdictional bases. A party seeking injunctive relief supports such

ex parte, and writ jurisdiction is exercised on a discretionary foundation. His Lordship

has very clearly taken cognisance of this fact in the said judgment and gone on to hold

that the principle of uberrima fides should similarly apply to applications under Article

126(2) of the Constitution.

23. In my view, the said conclusion of Yapa, J. most certainly stands to reason. In applications

of this nature, this Court often relies entirely on the contents of affidavits submitted by

the parties before us. Even where such other evidentiary material may be available for

consideration, fundamental rights proceedings are still guided greatly by the initial

pleadings set out in an application filed. This is why a party seeking to invoke such

jurisdiction is required to file a corresponding affidavit, swearing or affirming the

truthfulness of the material placed before this Court.

24. Where a petitioner deliberately approaches the Court with inaccurate, incomplete or

distorted facts, with a view to advancing a personal advantage, such conduct risks

miscarriages of justice and undermines the integrity of the judicial process. It must also

be borne in mind that if this Court were to arrive at a decision that is fundamentally

wrong on the strength of material so misrepresented, and without considering the

material suppressed, a party aggrieved by such a decision has no right of appeal,

however wrong that decision may be. Such an outcome, needless to say, would be

neither just nor equitable.

9 Jayasinghe v. The National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering (NIFNE) and others [2002] 1 Sri L.R. 27, at p. 286.

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 17 of 22

25. It is for such reasons that a duty of utmost good faith is imposed upon a litigant who

invokes the just and equitable jurisdiction of this Court in terms of Article 126 of the

Constitution.

26. The Respondents contend that the Petitioners have suppressed an Internal

Memorandum dated 25th July 2016, marked “17R-1”, issued by the Director General of

Customs to all staff officers—that would, of course, include the Petitioners. This

memorandum explicitly informed officers that new recruitment schemes for Sri Lanka

Customs had been in operation since 2010, with more than five years passed, and

stressed that fulfilling Condition No (I) of section 10.2.1.2 of the SOR, i.e., the Master's

degree or thesis requirement, was compulsory. It noted that a further grace period was

sought from the PSC for this qualification, but if denied, officers failing to complete it

would be ineligible for promotion to Grade I, urging immediate action. Had this

document been presented to the Court their early awareness of the mandatory thesis

requirement and the consequences of non-compliance, thereby undermining their

claim.

27. Similarly, the Petitioners have withheld an Internal Memorandum dated 17th October

2016, marked “17R-2”, which followed a PSC meeting on 12th October 2016 and notified

all staff officers, including the Petitioners, that the PSC would only forward applications

for Grade I promotions from those who had completed Condition No (I) of section

10.2.1.2. It conveyed the refusal of a further grace period and the need to fulfil this

requirement as soon as possible.

28. The Petitioners have also suppressed the PSC's amendment to the SOR in 2017, marked

“17R-3(a)”, which declared that only the 1979 batch would be exempted from Condition

No (I), making it mandatory for all other batches, including the Petitioners'. This

amendment formalised Condition No (I) as an indispensable requirement for promotion.

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 22

29. Furthermore, the Petitioners withheld disclosure of the Internal Memorandum dated 1st

June 2017, marked “17R-3”, circulated by the Director General of Customs to all staff

officers, stated that the officers handling duties in the posts of Acting Director of

Customs and those eligible for promotion must complete Condition No (I). It reinforced

that only the 1979 batch will be exempted per the PSC's decision.

30. The Petitioners failed to disclose the PSC's communication, marked “1R8”, which outlines

the PSC's interpretation of the exception clause in section 10.2.1.2 of the 2009 SOR. This

document specifies that when there are insufficient officers who have completed 7 years

in Grade II, promotions to Grade I can be made based on seniority and satisfactory

service without regard to the 7-year requirement, provided the other conditions are

fulfilled. This material directly contradicts the Petitioners' assertions that all eligibility

criteria under Clause 10.2.1.2 of the SOR were of equal weight without prioritisation, and

that the exception clause applied solely based on seniority when no officers had

completed 7 years of service in Grade II.

31. The Petitioners have further suppressed a letter dated 17th June 2019, marked “17R4”,

which granted promotions to twelve officers, who were contemporaries and juniors of

the Petitioners, to the post of Director of Customs (Executive Grade I) under the

aforesaid exception, with effective dates ranging from 6th June 2017 to 18th May 2018.

This document details that these promotions were made without considering the 7-year

service requirement, as the officers had fulfilled Condition No (I), (III) and (IV) of section

10.2.1.2. Had “17R4” been disclosed, it would have undermined the Petitioners' case by

demonstrating prior instances where the exception was applied precisely as in the

impugned promotions, allowing juniors who prioritised Condition No (I) to advance over

seniors like the Petitioners who delayed fulfilling it.

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 22

32. While the above mentioned elements of the suppression and misrepresentation relate

to all the Petitioners, the Petitioners have also suppressed the letter of promotion of the

1st Petitioner to Grade II, marked “1R1”. This letter accurately dates the 1st Petitioner’s

promotion to 8th September 2012, as opposed to 2nd April 2014, which is the date set

out by the Petitioners in paragraph 3 of the Petition. Accordingly, he had completed 7

years in Grade II on 8th September 2019, not on 2nd April 2021 as falsely claimed in

paragraph 13. The content of this document, if not withheld, would have been

unfavourable by exposing the 1st Petitioner's ineligibility for earlier promotions due to

his own delays, contradicting the collective claim that no one had 7 years.

33. Upon a careful consideration of the pleadings and the material placed before this Court,

I am of the view that the Petitioners have suppressed various material documents and

misrepresented various aspects relevant to the issues raised in this application. The

manner in which the submissions were presented was such that, without careful

examination, the Court could have easily been misled. This combined misrepresentation

by all Petitioners and suppression of documents amounts to a breach of uberrima fides,

as they systematically withhold and distort information essential for a fair judgment.

34. Accordingly, I uphold the preliminary objection raised by the Respondents on

suppression and misrepresentation. In light of this finding, this Court need not consider

the remaining objections raised by the Respondents.

35. Although it is not necessary to consider the merits of this application, as I have already

considered the merits to a great extent in my reasoning thus far, I wish to briefly

comment on the substance of their application as well.

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 22

Is there a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution?

36. The Petitioners contended that the action of the PSC, in overlooking the Petitioners and

promoting officers junior to the Petitioner to Grade I over and above the Petitioners,

violates their fundamental rights under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. The Petitioners

have contended that all conditions applicable to the selection process are required to

carry equal weight and that no criterion can be treated as more significant than another.

37. I am not inclined to accept this contention as the law does not require a rigid or

mechanical application of criteria devoid of regard to the nature and responsibilities of

the post. In matters relating to promotion and recruitment, the appointing authority is

entitled to determine the relative importance of applicable criteria, having regard to the

nature, responsibilities and requirements of the post. Seniority does not confer an

automatic right to promotion, and greater weight may legitimately be assigned to

considerations of merit, ability and performance where the duties of the higher post so

demand.10 Furthermore, a scheme of recruitment is not immutable and may be modified

or adjusted by the competent authority, provided such changes are reasonable

classifications relevant to a legitimate objective, non-arbitrary and applied equally to

those similarly situated.11

10 Dharmaratne and another v. Sri Lanka Export Development Board and 13 others [1995] 2 Sri L.R. 324; State of Mysore and another v. Syed Mahmood and Others [1968] AIR 1113; Samarasekera v. Attorney-General and Others SC FR 46/2021 (SC Minutes 23rd November 2022).

L.R. 11; Palihawadana v. Attorney General [1978] 1 Sri. L.R. 65

SC/FRA/194/2021 JUDGMENT Page 21 of 22

38. Accordingly, the assignment of differing weight to relevant criteria cannot, of itself, be

characterised as arbitrary or unreasonable. In the present case, the assignment of

differing weights to Condition No (I) and (II) of the SOR was expressly communicated to

the Petitioners by letter prior to the implementation of the process.

39. The Respondents who were promoted completed Condition No (I) earlier, thus

qualifying for promotions as vacancies arose from 2017-2020. In contrast, the

Petitioners, while being fully aware of the mandatory status and absence of a grace

period since 2017, still significantly delayed taking any meaningful action. They had

waited until mid-2019 to submit their thesis proposals,12 leading to thesis approvals only

in 2020.13 This protracted delay, despite repeated warnings and the clear deadline

implications from 2016-2017, demonstrates a lack of diligence on the Petitioners' part,

further distinguishing them from the Respondents who acted promptly. Acting

appointments provided no substantive override to any of the applicable criteria for

promotion, as the 1st June 2017 memorandum [marked “17R-3”] explicitly warned non-

promoted acting Directors to complete requirements swiftly.

40. The temporal disparity in readiness creates a rational distinction. Article 12(1) requires

equality among those who are similarly circumstanced and does not mandate identical

opposed to the Petitioners who slept on it—differently reflects legitimate classification

and not discrimination.

CONCLUSION

41. I find that the Petitioners have suppressed and misrepresented material facts in their

application before this Court, amounting to a breach of the duty of uberrima fides owed

to this Court, and this application ought to be dismissed in limine.

42. I further find that Petitioners have not been able to establish any violation of the

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

43. The application is dismissed, and each Petitioner is directed to pay a nominal sum of Rs.

5,000/- as State costs within three months from the date of this judgment.

Application Dismissed.
