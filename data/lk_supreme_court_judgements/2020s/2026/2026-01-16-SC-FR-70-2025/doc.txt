Written Submissions: Petitioner - 10.10.2025

1st- 4th, 7th- 9th &12th- 14th Respondents - 07.10.2025, 08.10.2025 Decided on: 16.01.2026.

Dr. Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

An application was made on behalf of the child who is the 1st Petitioner for admission to

Grade 1 at Sujatha Vidyalaya (‘School’) in Matara, under the category of ‘Children of

Residents in Close Proximity to the School’. The Petitioners state that they reside well

within the feeder area. They claim that their fundamental rights were infringed as the 1st

to 13th Respondents irrationally refused to admit the said 1st Petitioner to the School,

flouting the basic guidelines of the applicable circular relevant to the admission of children

to Grade 1 for the year 2025.

Admission to Government schools during the respective year was governed by Circular

No. 25/2024 marked ‘P3(i)’ issued by the Ministry of Education (‘Circular’). Children

who apply under the ‘close proximity’ category are required to provide documents in proof

Page 4 of 8

of their residence as outlined in Clause 7.2.1.1 of the said Circular. The Petitioners contend

that the Respondents have unreasonably withheld 16 marks from the 1st Petitioner by

erroneously determining that the main document had been vested in the name of the 2nd

Petitioner’s father-in-law for less than 6 months, relying exclusively on the letter dated

28.06.2024, issued by the National Housing Development Authority (‘NHDA’) verifying

the payment. Notably, the Petitioners received merely 0.8 marks based on the primary and

supplementary documents intended to prove their residency.

The document in proof of residence furnished by the Petitioners comprises a receipt from

the NHDA dated 24.05.1999, bearing an agreement of sale on its reverse. The respective

provisions stipulated in the said Clause 7.2.1.11 concerning such primary documents

issued in view of property acquired through the Government or Semi-Government

institutions, via instalment payments, translate into English as:

“Houses purchased on a payment basis from a government/semi-government

institution where the full amount has been received, but the property has not yet

been handed over to the owner through the relevant institutions.

(A written confirmation from the relevant institution that the full amount has been

paid must be submitted.)”

Pursuant to the aforementioned Circular, the assignment of marks for such documents to

prove residence adheres to the criteria outlined in Clause 7.2.1.2 Consequently, marks are

granted based on those documents, taking into account the length of time of the pertinent

document, demonstrating ownership or residency, has been registered in the applicant's

name. Marks are thus allocated in line with the percentages specified in Clause 7.2.1, by

evaluating a five-year timeframe ending on 30th June of the submission year, with reference

to the date such document was transferred to the name of the applicant seeking admission

to Grade 1.

The 'P2' document, which constitutes an agreement of sale, is registered under the name

of K.H. Sirisena, the grandfather of the 1st Petitioner. The application to school for

admission has been submitted by the father of the 1st Petitioner whilst the mother (‘2nd

Petitioner’) filed the instant Application stating that her husband is overseas.

According to the letter dated 28.06.2024, marked 'P5(ii)', sent by the NHDA to K.H.

Sirisena, the complete payment was finalised solely on that date. Anyhow, the Petitioners

claim 16 marks (full marks under the relevant category) should be awarded on the basis

that the property was in the name of K.H.Sirisena for a period of more than 5 years. In

contrast, the Respondents assessed the marks assuming the property was transferred into

K.H. Sirisena's possession on 28.06.2024, the purported date of completion of full

payment. The Respondents contend that K.H. Sirisena occupied the property in the

manner stipulated by the relevant Circular for merely two days prior to submitting the

application to the school for admission. As a result, in terms of Clause 7.2.1, only 5% of

the overall marks (equivalent to 0.8 marks) were granted, given that the document marked

'P5(ii)' had been in K.H. Sirisena's name for under six months.

The Petitioners primarily place reliance on the Judgement in Paalawa Rankoth Gedara

Kenudi Dilandi and Another v. Sandamali Aviruppola, Principal of Visakha Vidyalaya,

Colombo and Others SC/FR/13/2020 SC Minutes 29.09.2022. Vijith K. Malalgoda PC. J.

in the said Judgement accorded significant weight to the ‘agreement to purchase’ entered

into with the NHDA, notwithstanding the full settlement of all instalment payments. The

agreement in the cited case was entered into solely by the father of the child, who sought

admission to Grade 1. By contrast, in the instant case, neither the mother nor the father of

the child has executed any such agreement with the NHDA. Consequently, I am not

inclined to adopt the reasoning set forth in the said judgement in determining this Case.

Even the rationale in the case of Methanga and Another v. Herath and Others (2020) 2 Sri

LR 281, which was relied upon by the Petitioners, cannot be followed in the instant case

as it deals with a deed of gift and not an agreement of sale. Unlike a gift, an agreement,

such as in the instant case, requires the completion of instalment payments to effectuate

the formal transfer of title to the party who entered into it.

The learned State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents drew the attention of

this Court to the decision of the Supreme Court in S.M.N.S. Thilakarathne and Another v.

M.W.D.T.P. Wanasinghe, The Principal and the Chairman of the Interview Board of

Dharmaraja College, Kandy and Others SC/FR/30/2018 SC Minutes 28.05.2019, which,

in her opinion, parallels the factual matrix of the Case in hand. In the said case, E.A.G.R.

Amarasekara J. (with the concurrence of Murdu N.B. Fernando PC. J. - as she was then

and P. Padman Surasena J. - as His Lordship was then) observed that marks should be

allocated to the document to verify the residency only if it stands in the name of the

relevant person, as the provision is intended to apply exclusively to that person and not to

several. The Court in the said case further decided as follows;

“Furthermore, to give marks time is counted from the date the ownership or entitlement was

transferred to the name of the relevant person to the final date given to tender applications.

Since the time is counted until the final date given for applications, it impliedly indicates that

the relevant person aforementioned is the person who holds the relevant document in his/her

name as at the final date given to tender applications. The father of the 1st Petitioner, the

predecessor in title, did not hold the ownership in his name at the final date given to tender

applications, since he gifted his right to the Petitioner by executing deed marked as P5.

Therefore, I cannot accept the stance taken up by the 1st petitioner that she should have been

Page 7 of 8

given maximum 15 marks for the documents in proof of residency, which has to be in the

name of the relevant person.

On the other hand, there is no allegation that for any of the applicants, marks were given for

his/her or his/her spouse's title documents as well as for the title documents of the

father/mother of the applicant or his spouse causing discrimination.”

Based on the documents marked ‘P2’ and ‘P5(ii)’, it is clear that the property at issue was

formally transferred into the name of the 1st Petitioner's grandfather only on 28.06.2024,

upon completion of all instalment payments. Relying on this vesting date, the

Respondents, in line with Clause 7.2.1 of the relevant Circular, have assigned marks to

document ‘P5(ii)’, treating it as one held for lesser than six months. The Respondents

maintain that, pursuant to a strict reading of the said Clause, the ‘P5(ii)’ does not fully

satisfy the criteria set out in the Circular, even though 0.8 marks were granted for it in

favour of the Petitioners.

The Petitioners contend (especially in their Counter Affidavit) that another child, W.P.R.

Thinaya, presented an identical array of documents to those filed by the Petitioners and

ultimately received the full 16 marks in the ‘institution since birth’ category. On this basis,

the Petitioner maintains that the first Petitioner has resided in the premises in question

from birth. The Respondents, however, counter that the pertinent facts surrounding the

first Petitioner and W.P.R. Thinaya are not substantially alike in all key respects.

Similarly, the Respondents deny the assertions of the Petitioners upon discrimination on

the basis of income level or alleged social stigma. I am not satisfied with the material made

available to Court that the 1st Petitioner was discriminated on such grounds.

The learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners argue that this Court should exercise

its exclusive jurisdiction on fundamental rights extending the starting date of residence of

the Petitioners up to the date of agreement that was entered into between the said child’s

grandfather and the NHDA disregarding the date on which the payment of instalments

was completed. However, I do not consider the instant Application as a fit case to invoke

judicial creativity in favour of the Petitioner as no special circumstances exist warranting

me to provide a wider interpretation to the relevant provisions of the Circular.

In light of the foregoing, it is imperative that the provisions of the said Circular No.

25/2024 be interpreted with fidelity to their plain language and intent, abstaining from

Page 8 of 8

any form of judicial activism at this juncture which may rewrite or expand the scope of

respective provisions. Such restraint is a safeguard against arbitrary disparities in the

admission process, disparities that could unjustly favor the 1st Petitioner at Sujatha

Vidyalaya while disadvantaging countless other children across the country who seek

admissions to Government schools under the same Circular.

Thus, I am not convinced that the Petitioners’ fundamental rights under Article 12(i) have

been infringed due to the alleged conduct of the Respondents. Accordingly, I proceed to

dismiss the instant Application without cost.
