This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal, dated 02.08.2023

setting aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Awissawella case

bearing No: Rev/15/2015 dated 24.08.2017 and the order of the Learned

Magistrate of Awissawella case bearing No: 80769 dated 04.11.2015.

Facts of the Case

The Claimant-Petitioner-Appellant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

“Respondent”) is the registered owner of the motor vehicle bearing No. SG LD

0856. The Respondent had given the vehicle to the driver, Wijesundara

4

Ranasinghe Pabaluwe Mohottalage Chanaka Sanjeeva (hereinafter referred to

as the “Accused”) for the purpose of engaging in the business of transportation

(not specified what type of transportation). The said vehicle was detained by

the officers of Eheliyagoda police for allegedly transporting timber (Jak and

Nadun) without a valid permit which is an offence punishable in terms of

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance as amended by the Forest (Amendment)

Act No. 65 of 2009. The accused had pleaded guilty to the said offence on

25.02.2015 and the Learned Magistrate of Awissawella had ordered a fine of

Rs. 20,000/- with a default sentence of two months simple imprisonment.

Thereafter a vehicle inquiry was held on 03.06.2015 regarding the

confiscation of the vehicle. In conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned

Magistrate of Awissawella had ordered the confiscation of the vehicle. Being

aggrieved by the said order, the Respondent filed a revision application in the

High Court of Awissawella challenging the order of confiscation by the

Learned Magistrate. The Learned High Court judge of Awissawella had

affirmed the decision of the Learned Magistrate of Awissawella and dismissed

the said revision application. Being distressed by this decision, the

Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal where the Hon. Justices of the

Court of Appeal set aside the order made by the Learned High Court Judge of

Awissawella and the Learned Magistrate of Awissawella. Aggrieved by this

decision, the Appellant had made an application of Special Leave to Appeal to

the Supreme Court.

This Court by Order dated 06.05.2024, granted Leave to Appeal on the

questions of law stated in paragraph 26 (ii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (viii) the Petition

dated 13.09.2023, as set out below.

1. Did the Court of Appeal misdirect itself by considering the extraneous

issue of omissions in a charge sheet in considering the legality of a

confiscation order?

2. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to consider that any error

or omission in the charge cannot be considered as material as the case

5

record establishes that neither the accused who tendered an

unqualified plea of guilt to the charge nor the Petitioner who gave

evidence at the vehicle inquiry were misled by such error or omission?

3. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to consider that any

objection to a defect in a charge should be taken by the accused at the

very inception and that no such objection was taken by the accused in

the Magistrates Court or before a higher forum?

4. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to consider relevant judicial

pronouncements on confiscation?

5. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by failing to consider that

consideration of defects in a charge sheet at the belated stage of appeal

on an application made by a third party will be illogical as the conviction

also is indirectly canvassed by such course of action?

My analysis hereafter will be confined to examining the aforesaid questions of

law based on which leave was granted.

The first and the second questions of law will be considered together, that is

whether the Court of Appeal misdirected itself by considering the

extraneous issue of omissions in a charge sheet in considering the

legality of a confiscation order and if this omission misled the error or

omissions in the charge cannot be considered as the case record

establishes that neither the accused who tendered an unqualified plea of

guilt to the charge nor the Respondent who gave evidence at the vehicle

inquiry were misled by such error or omission.

Section 40(1) of the Forest ordinance as amended by the Forest (Amendment)

Act No. 65 of 2009 reads as follows;

40. (1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence-

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in

respect of which such offence has been committed; and

6

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in committing

such offence,

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be

confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is a

third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves

to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to

prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines,

as the case may be, for the commission of the offence.'.

The charge dated 25-02-2015, filed of record in the Magistrate Court case

reads as follows;

“ඉහත නම සදහන් චූදිත ව්න නුඹ විසින් මමම අධිකරණමේ බල ප්‍රමේශය ඇතුළත වූ

The charge set out that an offence under the Forest Ordinance has been

committed as amended by the Forest Amendment Acts No. 13 of 1966, No. 56

of 1979, No. 13 of 1982, No. 84 of 1988, No. 23 of 1995, No. 65 of 2009. It

further stated that the offence was punishable in terms of regulation 25 read

with regulation 9(1) of the Forest Regulations promulgated by the subject

minister under the power vested in him in terms of the Forest Ordinance as

7

amended and published in the Extraordinary Government Gazette No-68/14

dated 26.12.1979 and No-429/08 dated 26.11.1986.

It must be noted that the charge did not state that if the accused is found

guilty then the vehicle will be confiscated under Section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance as amended by the Forest (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009.

The Court of Appeal has considered that “It is therefore clear that when the

Accused was charged before the Magistrate Court for the alleged offence

committed by him, he had been informed that he would be punished under and

in terms of the Forest Regulations mentioned in the “Charge”. He has not been

informed of any punishable section under the Forest Ordinance, which attracts

the provisions of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance, if found Guilty”.

It is the Appellant’s position that the charge specifies the actus reus in words

namely that the Accused on a specific date and time transported without a

permit certain specified timbers (Jack and Nadun) of a specified value in lorry

bearing number SGLD 0856. The nature of the offence is clearly mentioned

by the aforementioned charge. The Appellant contends that the only issue

raised in the Judgment of the Court of Appeal is that a specific section of the

Forest Ordinance has not been mentioned in the charge.

The Appellant contends that section 24(1) of the Forest Ordinance by which

power is granted to make regulations is specifically mentioned in the charge.

In addition to that, the Forest Regulation No. 02 of 1979 published in gazette

extraordinary No 68/14 dated 26.12.1979 is specifically mentioned in the

charge. In terms of this gazette the transportation of such timber without a

permit is expressly prohibited. The Appellant contends that the violation of

any regulation made under Section 24(1) of the Forest Ordinance will attract

the penal provision of section 25 of the Forest Ordinance and will constitute

a Forest Offence which attracts section 40 of the Forest Ordinance dealing

with confiscation. The Appellant contended that the only defect in the charge

is that instead of referring to Regulation 5 the charge instead refers to

8

Regulation 9 which also relates to transportation of timber, but in a situation

where a permit has in fact been issued and the same permit had expired prior

to transportation. Regulation 25 which has been mentioned in the charge in

this case has a cross reference to section 25 of the Forest Ordinance.

The Appellant contend that although regulation 9 and 25 are strictly not

applicable in a situation where no permit has been issued, the Appellant

contended that the clear description of the actus reus in the body of the

charge in words, the reference to Section 24(1) of the Forest Ordinance in the

body of the charge and the automatic application of Section 25 which makes

the contravention of any Forest Regulation and offence under the Forest

Ordinance is sufficient to comply with section 165 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act on the necessary particulars of the charge. It is the Appellants

position that the failure to cite regulation 5 and instead citing regulation 9

read with regulation 25 is not a material omission as neither the accused

driver nor the Claimant Respondent were misled by such an omission.

Furthermore it is the Appellant position that the failure to cite Regulation No

5 and instead citing regulation No 9 read with regulation 25 is not a material

omission as neither the accused driver nor the Respondent were misled by

such omission.

Now turning to the established law.

In the case of Jayaratne Banda V. Attorney General (1997) 3 SLR 210, it

was held that,

" ... The defence the accused-appellant had taken was a simple denial of

the commission of the crime. There is nothing in the petition of appeal to

indicate that due to the mistake in the indictment the accused-appellant

was misled and thereby caused prejudice to his defence. In the

circumstances it is not difficult for us to conclude that the presence or

absence of the 'error' could not have made any difference to the general

9

conduct of the defence and therefore cannot be regarded as a material

error in terms of Section 166 of the Code …”

In Molagoda v. Gunaratne (39 NLR 226) Counsel for the accused-

appellant sought to elevate the question of the wrong Gazette in the

charge to a fundamental defect of procedure. He contended that an

omission to frame a charge in accordance with the provisions of the

Criminal Procedure Code was an omission to frame a charge at all. This

argument was rejected by the Supreme Court which held that a breach

of a specific rule of law in the Code was curable by the application of

Section 425 of the Old Criminal Procedure Code (which is equivalent to

section 436 of the present Code) if the breach had not caused a failure of

justice … "

In the case of H.P.D. Nimal Ranasinghe V. OIC, Police, Hettipola [SC

Appeal 149/2017), it was held that:

"The question that must be decided is whether any prejudice was caused

to the accused-appellant as a result of the said defect in the charge sheet

or whether he was misled by the said defect. It has to be noted here that

the accused-appellant, at the trial, had not taken up an objection to the

charge sheet on the basis of the said defect. In this connection judicial

decision in the case of Wickramasinghe Vs Chandradasa 67 NLR

550 is important. Justice Sri Skanda Rajah in the said case observed the

following facts.

"Where in a report made to Court under Section 148(l)(b) of the

Criminal Procedure Code, the Penal Provision was mentioned but,

in the charge sheet from which the accused was charged, the penal

section was not mentioned.”

His Lordship held as follows;

10

"The omission to mention in a charge sheet the penal section is not a fatal

irregularity if the accused has not been misled by such omission. In such

a case Section 171 of the Criminal Procedure Code is applicable."

In the case of H. G. Sujith Priyantha V. OIC, Police station, Poddala and

others [CA (PHC) 157/2012], it was held that,

"In this instance, the claim of the appellant who is not an accused in the

case had been made after the two accused were found guilty on their

own plea. Therefore, it is understood that the Court was not in a position

to consider the validity of the charge sheet at that belated point of time.

Indeed, an application under the aforesaid proviso to Section 40 in the

Forest Ordinance could only be made when confiscation has taken place

under the main Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. Aforesaid main

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance imposes a duty upon the Magistrate

who convicted the accused under the Forest Ordinance to confiscate the

vehicle used in committing such an offence. Furthermore, the word "shall"

is used in that main section and therefore the confiscation of the vehicle

is automatic when the accused is found guilty. Accordingly, it is clear that

the law referred to in the proviso to Section 40 is applicable only

thereafter. Therefore, I conclude that the appellant who made the

application relying upon the proviso to Section 40 is not entitled to raise

an issue as to the defects in the charge after the accused have pleaded

guilty to the charge under Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance.

Furthermore, the person who makes a claim under the proviso to the said

Section 40 could not have made such an application unless and until the

accused found guilty to a charge framed under the Forest Ordinance.

Hence, it is clear that he is making such a claim, knowing that the

accused were already been convicted for a particular charge under the

Forest Ordinance. Therefore, the appellant is stopped from claiming the

cover relying on the defects in the charge sheet, in his application made

under the proviso to Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance….”

11

I am of the view that the omission of the penal section in the charge sheet

does not, in any manner, prejudice the accused. The charge sheet, though

referring to the wrong section in the regulations, nevertheless contains all

material particulars necessary to inform the accused of the nature of the

offence. It clearly sets out the name of the offence, the date on which it was

committed, the vehicle number involved, the species of timber that was

unlawfully transported without a permit, the assessed value of such timber,

as well as the relevant Gazette notification and its subsequent amendments.

These particulars are sufficient to afford the accused reasonable notice of the

charge he was required to answer.

It is evident, therefore, that the error or omission in the charge sheet did not

mislead or otherwise cause any injustice to the accused. The record reflects

that the charges were duly explained to him, and he voluntarily entered a plea

of guilty. During the vehicle inquiry, the Respondent was fully aware of the

nature of the charge against the accused and was also cognizant of the fact

that the accused had admitted to the offence. Accordingly, neither party can

be said to have been misled by the omission complained of.

In these circumstances, such an omission cannot be regarded as a material

defect capable of vitiating the proceedings, as discussed in the authorities

referred to above. Once the accused had unequivocally pleaded guilty to the

offence, it is not open to either the accused or the Respondent to subsequently

rely on a technical defect or omission in the charge sheet as a ground of

defence. The alleged deficiency is, therefore, immaterial and does not affect

the validity or legality of the confiscation order made by the learned

Magistrate.

A similar view was expressed by the Court of Appeal in Range Forest Officer

v. Kottasha Arachchige Ubhayaweera and Ramachandran

Gnaneshwaran [2012] CA (PHC) 95/2012, and reaffirmed in Cadar Bawa

Jennathul Farida v. Range Forest Officer and the Attorney General

[2017] CA (PHC) 94/2017, where it was held that the absence or omission of

12

a penal provision in the charge sheet, in the absence of demonstrable

prejudice, does not render the proceedings invalid.

For matters of convenience the third and fifth questions of law will be dealt

together. Namely that any objection to a defect in a charge should be

taken by the accused at the very inception, and that no such objection

can thereafter be taken by the accused either in the Magistrate’s Court

or before a higher forum. The 5th question of law being “Did the Court of

Appeal err in law by failing to consider that consideration of defects in a

charge sheet at the belated stage of appeal on an application made by a

third party will be illogical as the conviction also is indirectly canvassed

by such course of action?”

In terms of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance, a vehicle becomes liable to

confiscation only when the Accused is found guilty of committing a forest

offence.

The Appellant contends that no appeal or revision was ever lodged by the

Accused Driver against his conviction. Furthermore, the B Report marked P2A

of the brief sets out a detailed description of how the Accused Driver had

committed the offence of transportation of timber without a valid permit.

Furthermore, the Appellant contends that the Respondent submitted himself

to the vehicle inquiry knowing very well that the offence of transportation of

timber without a permit for which the Accused driver was arrested for.

In the aforesaid case of Jayaratne Banda it was further held that,

“…Had the objection to the indictment been taken at the trial it would

have been open to the Court to have acted under Section 167 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act to amend the indictment. Senior Counsel for the

appellant too conceded that it was open for the prosecution to have

amended the indictment at any stage before the close of the prosecution

case ... "

13

In the case of Lionel V. Officer-In-Charge, Meetiyagoda Police Station

[1987] 1 SLR 210, it was held that,

“that the time at which it falls to be determined that the conditions that

the offences alleged had been committed in the course of the same

transaction had been fulfilled, is the time when the accusation is made,

and not when the trial is concluded and the result is known”

In the case of A.K.K. Rasika Amarasinghe V. Attorney General and another

[SC Appeal 140/2010), it was held that,

"The Accused-Appellant has not raised an objection to the charge at the

trial. In the first place we note that at page 97, the Accused-Appellant

has admitted that he knows about the charge. As I pointed out earlier the

Accused-Appellant has failed to raise any objections to the charge at the

trial. In this regard I rely on the judgment of the Court of Criminal

Appeal in 45 NLR page 82 in King V. Kitchilan wherein the Court of

Criminal appeal held as follows:

"The proper time at which an objection of the nature should be

taken is before the accused has pleaded"

“It is well settled law that if a charge sheet is defective, objection to the

charge sheet must be raised at the very inception."

In the aforesaid case of H. G. Sujith Priyantha it was further held that,

“Moreover, in the event this court makes a determination the issue as to

the defects in the charge sheet at this late stage, it may lead to raise

questions as the conviction of the accused as well. Such a position is

illogical and certainly it will lead to absurdity. Such an absurdity should

not be allowed to prevail before the eyes of the law……”

14

Accordingly, it is my considered view that any objection pertaining to a defect

in the charge sheet ought properly to have been raised at the earliest possible

stage, namely, before the accused entered his plea of guilt. The law is well

settled that any defect or irregularity in a charge sheet must be taken up

during the trial before the learned Magistrate, thereby affording the court an

opportunity to rectify such error without occasioning prejudice to either party.

As observed in the authorities cited above, an accused who, with full

knowledge of the charge, voluntarily and unequivocally pleads guilty, cannot

thereafter challenge the validity of the proceedings on the basis of an alleged

defect in the charge sheet. Once such a plea has been entered, the accused is

deemed to have accepted the charge as framed, together with all its

particulars.

While the Respondent has a right to his property, namely his vehicle, it is

incumbent upon him to establish that he had no knowledge of, and had taken

all reasonable precautions to prevent, the commission of the offence. The

Respondent has failed to discharge this burden. The Respondent claims that

he had given verbal instructions to the Accused Driver not to transport timber

without a permit. I am of the view that merely giving verbal instructions is not

sufficient to discharge the burden cast upon him by law to take all necessary

precautions to prevent the commission of the offence. Moreover, he cannot

now seek to rely upon an alleged defect in the charge sheet as a defence at

the appellate stage.

In Somawathie v. Wilson and Others [2010] 1 Sri L.R. 128, it was held

that a new ground cannot be raised for the first time on appeal if it was not

taken up at the trial under the issues so framed. The Court, however, may

consider such a ground if:

1. it raises a pure question of law and not a mixed question of law and

fact;

2. the question was in substance put forward in the lower court under

one of the issues raised; and

15

3. the appellate court has before it all the material necessary to decide

the question.

The Respondent has failed to satisfy these requirements, particularly the

second criterion, and therefore cannot raise a new ground at this stage of

appeal. To permit such a contention would be contrary to established

appellate principles and would indirectly render the conviction and

confiscation order defective. It is therefore the view of this Court that the

belated challenge to the charge sheet cannot be sustained.

The next and final question of law is the failure in considering the relevant

judicial pronouncements in confiscation.

In the case of Sinnetamby v Ramalingam 26 NLR 371, it was held that,

“... before an order of confiscation is made, the owner should be given an

opportunity of being heard, and that an order of confiscation should not

be made, unless the owner is in some way implicated in the offence which

renders the thing liable to confiscation."

In the case of Rasiah v Thambiraj [1951] 53 NLR 574, Nagalingam, J stated

that:

"It is one of the fundamentals of administration of justice that a person

should not be deprived either of his liberty or of his property without an

opportunity being given to him to show cause against such an order being

made. To take a case, which cannot be regarded as an extreme one,

where an owner lends or hires his cart without knowing that the borrower

or hirer intends to use it for the purpose of committing an offence, would

it be right to confiscate the cart merely because it has been so used. I

think that if the owner can show that the offence was committed without

his knowledge and without his participation in the slightest degree,

justice would seem to demand that he should be restored his property.”

16

In the case of Manawadu v the Attorney General [1987] 2 SLR 30,

Sharvananda CJ, said that:

“But if the owner had no role to play in the commission of the offence and

is innocent, then forfeiture of his vehicle will not be penalty but would

amount to arbitrary expropriation since he was not a party to the

commission of any offence. Among the important rights which individuals

traditionally have enjoyed is the right to own property. This right is

recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Article

17(1) of which states that everyone has the right to own property and

Article 17(2) guarantees that 'no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his

property.'”

In the case of Mary Matilda Silva v Inspector of Police, Habarana, Sisira

de Abrew J. held that:

"In my view, for the owner of the vehicle to discharge the burden (1) that

he/she had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence (2) that the vehicle had been used for the

commission of the offence without his/her knowledge, mere giving

instructions is not sufficient. In order to discharge the burden embodied

in the proviso to section 3A of the Animals Act is it sufficient for the owner

to say that instructions not to use the vehicle for illegal purpose had been

given to the driver? If the Courts of this country is going to say that it is

sufficient, then all what the owner in a case of this nature has to say is

that he gave said instructions. Even for the second offence, this is all that

he has to say. Then there is no end to the commission of the offence and

to the use of the vehicle for the commission of the offence. Every time

when the vehicle is detected with cattle all what he has to say is that he

had given instructions to the driver. Then the purpose of the legislature

in enacting the proviso to section 3A of the Animals Act is frustrated."

17

In the case of Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd. v Range forest

Officer, Ampara, /SC Appeal 120/2011, it was held that;

"The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadu V.

Attorney General. Therefore, it is settled law that before an order for

forfeiture is made the owner should be given an opportunity to show

cause. If the owner on balance of probability satisfies the Court that he

has taken precautions to prevent the commission of the offence or the

offence was committed without his knowledge, nor he was privy to the

commission of the offence then the vehicle has to be released to the

owner.”

In the case of The Finance Company PLC v Priyantha Chandana and

Others (2010) 2 Sri L R 220 it was held that;

“On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned

decisions, it is abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance, as amended, if the owner of the vehicle in question was third

party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to

the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent

the use of the said vehicle for the commission of the offence. The ratio

decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions also show that the owner

has to establish the said matter on a balance of probability. "

Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance as amended by the Forest (Amendment)

Act No. 65 of 2009 provides exceptions to a confiscation of a vehicle if the

owner of the vehicle proves that he had taken all precautions to prevent the

commission of the offence. The judicial precedents in confiscation of the

vehicle had been that if the owner can prove that the offence was committed

without his knowledge or if he had taken all precautions to prevent the

commission of offence then the vehicle cannot be confiscated.

18

In the aforementioned case of The Finance Company PLC, Dr. Shirani A.

Bandaranayake, J. held that;

“Several measures could have been taken in this regard. For instance, there

could have been a clause to that effect in the agreement between the appellant

and the 1st respondent. Similarly if the 1st respondent had authorized others to

use the said vehicle, he too could have had a written agreement inclusive of

specified conditions.”

In the aforementioned case of Mary Matilda Silva, it was held that;

“…mere giving instructions is not sufficient”

It is evident from the authorities that the mere issuance of instructions by a

vehicle owner is not, in itself, sufficient to discharge the burden of proving

that all necessary precautions were taken to prevent the commission of an

offence. The law requires that the owner demonstrate that he exercised due

diligence and took every reasonable step to ensure that the vehicle was not

used for any unlawful purpose.

In the present case, the Respondent has only established that he issued

certain oral instructions to the driver. However, such instructions, by

themselves, cannot be regarded as constituting all the precautions that a

prudent owner ought to have taken. In his testimony before the learned

Magistrate, the Respondent stated that he had instructed the driver not to

transport sand or wood but made no mention of issuing any direction with

regard to the transportation of timber without a valid permit. This omission

is significant. The testimony of the accused driver corroborates this position,

as he too confirmed that the Respondent had not given any specific

instructions regarding the transport of timber. The driver further stated that

the Respondent had no knowledge of the incident and that his employment

was terminated following the incident in question.

19

It is also noteworthy that the Respondent admitted that he had never

personally inspected or visited the locations to verify the movements of his

vehicle and had relied solely on telephone communication for this purpose.

Such a method cannot be regarded as a sufficient precautionary measure. It

is neither reasonable nor realistic to expect that a driver engaged in unlawful

activities would voluntarily disclose such conduct to the vehicle owner during

routine telephone calls.

Furthermore, the Respondent is engaged in operating a sawmill, and he has

failed to produce any evidence to establish that the timber in question was

not intended for, or transported to his sawmill. The learned Magistrate, upon

a careful evaluation of the evidence, was not satisfied that the Respondent

lacked knowledge of the commission of the offence. In the absence of credible

proof of due diligence or precautionary measures, the Respondent has failed

to discharge the burden required of him under the law.

In the case of Kumara de Silva & Others V Attorney General (2010) 2 Sri

L.R. 169, it was held that;

"Credibility is a question of fact, not of law. Appeal Court Judges

repeatedly stress the importance of the trial judge's observations of the

demeanour of witnesses in deciding questions of fact. The acceptance or

rejection of evidence of witnesses is therefore a question of fact for the

trial Judge, since he or she is in the best position to hear and observe

witnesses. In such a situation the Appellate courts will be slow to

interfere with the findings of the trial Judge unless such evidence could

be shown to be totally inconsistent or perverse and lacking credibility."

As observed in the aforementioned case, this Court is not entitled to interfere

with the findings of fact and conclusions arrived at by the learned Magistrate

upon a proper consideration of the evidence placed before the Court unless it

is perverse. Accordingly, this Court is in agreement with the learned

Magistrate’s finding that the Respondent has failed to establish that the

timber in question was not transported to his sawmill.

20

The Respondent has also failed to discharge the burden of proving that he

exercised all reasonable precautions to prevent the commission of the offence,

or that he lacked knowledge thereof. In the absence of such proof, the

statutory requirements under Section 40(1) are clearly satisfied. Therefore,

upon the accused being found guilty of the offence, the confiscation of the

vehicle was lawfully ordered in accordance with the said provision.

When considering all the above discussed circumstances, it is evident that

the error or omissions in a charge sheet did not mislead the accused or the

Respondent, therefore when the accused pleaded guilty and convicted, the

vehicle is liable to be confiscated. The error or omission in the charge must

have been brought at the trial stage in the Magistrate Court and not at an

appeal stage. If the defects of a charge are considered at the appeal stage,

then the conviction would be incorrect. Even though the Respondent had a

proprietary right over the vehicle, he had failed to establish that he had no

knowledge of the commission of the offence or that he had taken all necessary

precautionary measures to prevent the commission of the offence.

Having examined the facts of the case, the material placed before this court

and due to the reasons mentioned above, the questions of law on which leave

has been granted are answered in the affirmative.

Therefore, I allow the appeal of the Appellant by upholding the orders of the

Magistrate Court of Awissawella and the High Court of Awissawella and set

aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Appeal Allowed.
