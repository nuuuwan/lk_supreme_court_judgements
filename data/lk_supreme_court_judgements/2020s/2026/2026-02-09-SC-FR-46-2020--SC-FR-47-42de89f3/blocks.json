During the search, there had been two loud noises erupting from the upstairs of the house. The position of the 1st Respondent - Senior Superintendent of Police and Director of the Criminal Investigation Department is that those two noise eruptions were due to two explosions which had occurred in the upper floor of the house soon after they entered the house. It later transpired that the explosions were due to two further suicide bombs by another family member of Yusuf Ibrahim. These explosions resulted in the death of three police officers (who were members of the team of police officers who entered the premises) and four family members of Yusuf Ibrahim. Thereafter, Yusuf Ibrahim\u2019s other son - Mohamed Ibrahim Ijaz Ahmed and Yusuf Ibrahim\u2019s son-in-law \u2013 Mohamed Yusuf Aflal Ahmed, were taken into custody by the 2nd Respondent - Assistant Superintendent of Police, Homicide Unit of the Criminal Investigation Department. The 2nd Respondent had also arrested Yusuf Ibrahim on suspicion that he had also been involved in the blasts that occurred. Consequently, he has been kept in detention in terms of a detention order issued under section 9(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979. 5.

It has also defined standing at page 1695 as \u201ca party\u2019s right to make a legal claim or seek judicial enforcement of a duty or right\u201d. Professor Wade in \u201cWade & Forsyth\u2019s Administrative Law\u201d (12th Edition, page 565) explaining the law on standing, has expressed views regarding the distinction between \u201ca mere busybody who interferes in something in which he has no legitimate concern (no standing) and a person affected by or having a reasonable concern in the matter to which the application relates (standing is established)\u201d. Professor Wade further explains that, \u201cto fall within the latter category, to be \u2018affected by\u2019 the matter to which an application relates, is to suffer any impact upon a \u2018particular\u2019 or \u2018personal\u2019 interest, based on some \u2018legal relation\u2019 to the subject matter of the claim, which is certainly enough to establish a \u2018sufficient interest\u2019.

Amerasinghe observed that, \u201cArticle 126(2) confers a recognized position only upon the person whose fundamental rights are alleged to have been violated and upon an attorney-at-law acting on behalf of such a person. No other person has a right to apply to the Supreme Court for relief or redress in respect of the alleged infringement of fundamental rights\u201d. This view aligns with the plain and literal interpretation I have earlier adopted to interpret Article 126(2) of the Constitution and Rule 44(2) of the Supreme Court Rules. Moving further, Justice Dr. Amerasinghe in this Judgment has also considered the aspect of adopting an expansive interpretative approach to Article 126(2) beyond its literal sense and has stated that \u201c\u2026 in the Article before us, the words are in themselves precise and unambiguous and there is no absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the Constitution, the words themselves do best declare that intention. No more can be necessary than to expound those words in their plain, natural, ordinary, grammatical and literal sense\u201d. I find myself in agreement with this view, as a written law (and certainly an Article in the Constitution) should be given an expansive interpretation only in instances where the law stands ambiguous, absurd, repugnant, or inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution. In my view, the written law contained in Article 126(2) when read in its plain literal sense, provides a clear and coherent rule on permitted standing, to make a Fundamental",

In instances where the aggrieved detainee is given access to an Attorney-at-Law and such Attorney-at-Law receives instructions to file a Fundamental Rights Application alleging the infringement of fundamental rights, it is the duty of such Attorney-at-Law to, acting in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution, function as the Petitioner and also sign the Petition in his capacity as the Petitioner. Besides such a situation, in an instance where the aggrieved detainee cannot either directly or through a family member retain an Attorney-at-Law due to no or very limited access, an authorised person with access to the detainee (such as a family member) having received instructions from the detainee, may appoint an Attorney-at-Law to function as the Petitioner and sign the Petition in such capacity and thereby act on behalf of the detainee. In this regard, an ideal example would be the situation which led to the Judgment of the Supreme Court in Mohamed Razik Mohamed Ramzy v. B.M.A.S.K. Senaratne, OIC, Criminal Investigation Department and Others (SC/FR Application No. 135/2020, SC Minutes of 14th November, 2023), where an Attorney-at-Law had petitioned this Court on behalf of the aggrieved Mohamed Razik Mohamed Ramzy who was at that time in detention. The Attorney-at-Law, Mr. Musthafa Kamal Bacha Ramzeen had, in that matter, acted in his capacity as the Petitioner, and the detainee (Mohamed Razik Mohamed Ramzy) had become the Virtual Petitioner. Therefore, even in instances where an aggrieved person in detention is barred from making an Application to this Court due to limited access, his grievance may be presented to this Court by an Attorney-at-Law serving as the Petitioner and signing the Petition. 34.

This is presumably through the availability of access to the detainee. Thus, the element of access has not been contested in this Application. However, in SC FR Nos. 47/2020 and 48/2020, the learned counsel for the Petitioners in post-hearing written submissions dated 2nd September 2024, submitted that the detainees did not have access to family members or to lawyers, and that resulted in the two Petitioners (Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed Ishran Ahamed and Fathima Rushda Iqbal) retaining an Attorney-at-Law to petition the Supreme Court. It is noteworthy that this contention has not been raised in the initial pleadings, but has been raised at a stage as late as the post-hearing stage. The Affidavits tendered on behalf of the two detainees do not allege that the detainees were not given access. Thus, that position advanced by learned Counsel for the Petitioners cannot be accepted. 36. Furthermore, it is necessary to observe that with regard to Fundamental Rights",
