SC/APPEAL/178/2025

Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action as far back as 1991 in the District Court

of Panadura seeking partition of a land in extent of 2 acres, 3 roods and 8

perches described in the schedule to the plaint. She named six defendants,

stating that they were made parties solely on the basis that they were living

on the land, and that she was unaware of the basis on which they were in

occupation. She claimed entitlement to 26/42 shares of the land and prayed

that the balance be left unallotted.

It must be observed that the plaintiff commenced this action in a highly

unsatisfactory manner. She was neither in possession of the land nor

residing on it. Her claim was founded solely on very old deeds. By instituting

the action in this manner, she placed all parties in a position of considerable

difficulty and uncertainty. Several additional parties were later added to the

proceedings.

Preliminary Plan No. 732 was prepared by Mr. Sirisoma, Licensed Surveyor,

depicting a land in extent of 2 acres, 3 roods and 12 perches. Numerous

defendants thereafter filed statements of claim seeking dismissal of the

action, exclusion of portions of the land, or other relief. The 1ˢᵗ to 5ᵗʰ

defendants filed a joint statement of claim, as did the 7ᵗʰ, 8ᵗʰ and 14ᵗʰ

defendants. The 6ᵗʰ, 10ᵗʰ, 12ᵗʰ and 13ᵗʰ defendants filed separate statements

of claim.

The consistent position taken by most of these defendants, supported by

old deeds and plans, was that no land, as described in the plaint, existed

on the ground. They asserted that they were in possession of clearly defined

and demarcated portions of land for a considerable period of time, and that

there was no common possession. In support of this position, the

defendants tendered their respective plans and had them superimposed on

the preliminary plan through the same surveyor, Mr. Sirisoma.

SC/APPEAL/178/2025

One such plan is Plan No. 1287, prepared at the instance of the 7ᵗʰ, 8ᵗʰ and

14ᵗʰ defendants. That plan depicts lots marked 1A to 1G. According to the

proceedings dated 04.05.2001, upon an agreement between the 7ᵗʰ, 8ᵗʰ and

14ᵗʰ defendants on the one hand and the other parties on the other, lots 1A,

1C, 1D, 1E and 1F depicted in Plan No. 1287 were agreed to be excluded

from the land to be partitioned. The 7ᵗʰ, 8ᵗʰ and 14ᵗʰ defendants are living on

those lots. However, there is no reference in those proceedings to lot 1G,

which lies on the southern boundary of lot 1E.

On the same day’s proceedings, while giving evidence, the plaintiff stated

that lots 1A, 1C, 1D, 1E and 2A in Plan No. 1287 could be excluded from

the corpus, and that lot 1B could be partitioned. However, the plan does

not indicate the extent of lot 1B, nor did the plaintiff adduce any evidence

regarding its extent. The plaintiff also did not address the exclusion of lot

1G. Further, although the plaintiff referred to lot 2A, no such lot as 2A

appears in Plan No. 1287.

Thereafter, according to the proceedings dated 15.06.2004, in answer to

questions posed during the cross-examination by learned counsel for the 1ˢᵗ

to 5ᵗʰ defendants, the plaintiff stated that she wished the entire land

depicted in the preliminary plan to be partitioned.

The 1ˢᵗ to 5ᵗʰ defendants had their old plans superimposed on the

preliminary plan through Mr. Sirisoma, Licensed Surveyor. That plan is

Plan No. 2014. In preparing this plan, old Plans Nos. 472 and 1285 were

superimposed on the preliminary plan, clearly identifying the portions of

land which the 1ˢᵗ to 5ᵗʰ defendants have been in possession. These portions

are shown as lots numbered 1285/1 to 1285/6. The evidence establishes

that the said defendants have been residing on these lots for a long time,

having constructed houses thereon.

SC/APPEAL/178/2025

In cross-examination, the plaintiff admitted that the 1ˢᵗ to 5ᵗʰ defendants

had been living on those portions for a long period. A careful reading of the

evidence also indicates that the plaintiff did not seriously object to the

exclusion of those portions from the land to be partitioned. Significantly,

those lots fall within lot 1B as depicted in Plan No. 1287. These admissions

and shifting positions, taken together, clearly demonstrate that the plaintiff

herself was uncertain as to the precise extent and identity of the land she

sought to have partitioned.

After trial, the learned District Judge dismissed the plaintiff’s action on the

ground that the land sought to be partitioned had not been properly

identified. The High Court affirmed that judgment. This Court granted leave

to appeal on the question whether the High Court erred in law by failing to

consider that the plaintiff could have proceeded with the action by confining

the partition to lot 1B as depicted in Plan No. 1287. On the facts and

circumstances of this case, I answer that question in the negative.

The appeal is accordingly dismissed. The contesting defendants are entitled

to costs in all three Courts, recoverable from the plaintiff.
