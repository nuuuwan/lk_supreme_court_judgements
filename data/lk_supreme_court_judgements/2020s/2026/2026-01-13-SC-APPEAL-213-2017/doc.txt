Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Kurunegala,

naming five defendants, seeking the partition of the land among them, with

shares claimed as follows: the plaintiff 2/6, the 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ, and 3ʳᵈ defendants

1/6 in common, the 4ᵗʰ defendant 1/6, and the 5ᵗʰ defendant 2/6. The

preliminary plan No. 2331 depicted four lots, namely lots 1 to 4, as forming

part of the corpus.

The 4ᵗʰ defendant filed a statement of claim admitting the corpus, while

making certain adjustments to the calculation of shares. The 4ᵗʰ defendant

accepted the plaintiff’s 1/3 share. The 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ, 3ʳᵈ and 5ᵗʰ defendants filed a

joint statement of claim in which they asserted that lot 1 in the preliminary

plan was a different land known as Wanewatta. They also proposed certain

adjustments to the calculation of shares, but accepted the plaintiff’s 1/3

share. The 6ᵗʰ, 7ᵗʰ, and 8ᵗʰ defendants filed a statement of claim seeking the

exclusion of lot 1 from the corpus.

After trial, the learned District Judge held that lots 1 to 4 depicted in the

preliminary plan formed part of the land to be partitioned, and proceeded

to partition the land among the parties in accordance with the shares set

out in the plaint, subject to the finding that Madamulle Durayalage Manika

had gifted only 1/12, out of her 1/3 share, to her granddaughter, the 5ᵗʰ

defendant, Babi alias Dayawathie, by deed marked 5V1, and the balance of

4

SC/APPEAL/213/2017

the 1/3 share shall remain unallotted. “[මැදමුල්ලල් දුරයලාලේ] මැණිකාලේ

ලකාටසින් 1/12 ක් 5වි1 මගින් 5 වන විත්තිකාරියට දී ඇි අතර ඉිරි ලකාටස් ලනාලෙදූ ලකාටස්

ලලස තැබීමට තීරණය කරමි.”1

Being dissatisfied with the judgment of the District Court, the 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ, 3ʳᵈ

and 5ᵗʰ defendants preferred an appeal to the High Court of Civil Appeal of

Kurunegala. The sole ground urged in the petition of appeal was that lot 1

ought to have been excluded from the corpus, and no pedigree dispute was

raised for determination.

The learned High Court Judge has given reasons for concluding that lot 1

cannot, on a balance of probabilities, form part of the corpus, having regard

inter alia to its boundaries and extent. I see no reason to interfere with that

finding.

However, the learned High Court Judge, in the absence of any submission

made on behalf of the 1ˢᵗ, 2ⁿᵈ, 3ʳᵈ and 5ᵗʰ defendants, and without affording

the plaintiff any opportunity to be heard, raised a pedigree dispute ex mero

motu in the judgment and unilaterally concluded that the plaintiff was not

entitled to any share. Having so decided, the learned High Court Judge

proceeded to determine the shares as follows: the 1ˢᵗ to 3ʳᵈ defendants 3/24,

the 4ᵗʰ defendant 5/24, and the 5ᵗʰ defendant 2/24, with the balance shares

to remain unallotted.

I shall now consider the basis on which the learned High Court Judge, ex

mero motu, concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to any share. It is

common ground among the parties that, at one point in time, there were

three original owners, each entitled to a 1/3 share. One such owner was

Bandiya, who held a 1/3 share, and another was Madamulle Durayalage

Manika, who also held a 1/3 share. According to the plaintiff, the remaining

1 The District Judge has also stated in the judgment that the 5th defendant is entitled to 2/12 share (as stated in the plaint) but it should be disregarded.

SC/APPEAL/213/2017

1/3 share belonged jointly to Kira and Siyathu. According to the defendants,

however, the remaining 1/3 share belonged to Sasira.

The plaintiff derives title from Bandiya. Bandiya transferred his 1/3 share

to Karunapedi Durayalage Manikee by deed P1, and Manikee in turn

transferred that share to Samadaree by deed P2. The learned District Judge

held that, upon the death of Samadaree, her 1/3 share devolved on her

mother, the said Manikee, who thereafter transferred that share to the

plaintiff by deed P3.

Another original owner, namely Madamulle Durayalage Manika, gifted

1/12, out of her 1/3 share, to her granddaughter, Babi alias Dayawathie,

the 5th defendant, by deed marked 5V1, stating in the deed that the source

of title was maternal inheritance from Samadaree.

On the basis that Samadaree figured in two deeds emanating from different

sources, namely deeds P2 and 5V1, the learned High Court Judge

concluded that “Karunapedi Durayalage Manikee [the plaintiff’s

predecessor] cannot have a title inherited from her daughter Samadaree to

feed deed P3 and the recipient of it, the plaintiff cannot have any rights on

that deed.”

Although the learned High Court Judge proceeded on the basis that there

was only one person named Samadaree, no defendant at any stage of the

proceedings asserted that there was only one Samadaree, or that such

Samadaree was the daughter of Madamulle Durayalage Manika and not of

Karunapedi Durayalage Manikee. This was an assumption made by the

learned High Court Judge without any issue having been raised by the

parties at the trial, and without affording any opportunity to the parties to

address or contradict that position. Such an approach cannot be sustained.

Had an opportunity been afforded, the plaintiff and the other defendants

would have been in a position to demonstrate that there were in fact two

6

SC/APPEAL/213/2017

persons named Samadaree, as well as two distinct persons named Manika,

namely Karunapedi Durayalage Manikee and Madamulle Durayalage

Manika.

Leave to appeal was granted principally on two questions of law. The first

was whether the High Court of Civil Appeal erred in excluding lot 1 from the

corpus. The second was whether the said Court erred in denying the

plaintiff a 1/3 share on a basis never contemplated by the parties. I answer

the former in the negative and the latter in the affirmative.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal is

set aside, except in so far as it holds that lot 1 should be excluded from the

corpus, and the judgment of the District Court is restored, subject to the

exclusion of lot 1 from the land to be partitioned as depicted in the

preliminary plan marked X.
