Introduction

The Plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Gampaha against

the 1ˢᵗ Defendant, her daughter, and the 2ⁿᵈ Defendant, the minor son of

the 1ˢᵗ Defendant, seeking to set aside Deed of Gift No. 5 marked P4, by

which she gifted the property to the 1ˢᵗ Defendant subject to her life interest,

on the ground of gross ingratitude. She further sought a declaration that

Deed of Gift No. 5272 marked P7, executed by the 1ˢᵗ Defendant in favour

of the 2ⁿᵈ Defendant, has no force or avail in law.

The Defendants filed answer seeking dismissal of the action, contending

that the property had been given to the 1ˢᵗ Defendant in consideration of her

marriage (donatio propter nuptias), and therefore could not be revoked even

if gross ingratitude was established.

After trial, the District Court entered judgment for the Plaintiff, holding that

the gift in question was not a dotal gift and that the 1ˢᵗ Defendant was guilty

of gross ingratitude. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Gampaha

reversed the judgment of the District Court and dismissed the Plaintiff’s

action, holding that P4 constituted a dotal gift and therefore could not be

3

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

revoked on the ground of gross ingratitude unless the right of revocation

had been expressly reserved.

This Court had granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law:

(a) Is the Judgment of the High Court contrary to law and against the

weight of evidence on record?

(b) Has the High Court erred in coming to the finding that the property

gifted on Deed No. 5 to the 1st Defendant was given as a dotal gift?

(c) Has the High Court erred by coming into the finding that the wording

used in the Deed is not the wording used for a usual Deed of Gift, but

goes beyond that and explicitly states that the property is gifted for

her future benefit?

(d) Has the High Court misapplied the ratio decidendi of the judgment in

Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera Menike v. Rohini Senanayake and

decided that the wording of Deed No. 5 suggested that the property

was gifted to the 1st Defendant as dowry?

(e) In the event the Deed of Gift does not contain a recital to the effect

that the donee be looked after, can there be an action for gross

ingratitude?

Under Roman-Dutch Law, the general rule is that a deed of gift is absolute

and irrevocable. Nevertheless, Roman-Dutch Law recognises an exception

to this principle, namely that even an irrevocable deed of gift may be revoked

on the ground of gross ingratitude. This position has now been given

statutory recognition by sections 2 and 3 of the Revocation of Irrevocable

Deeds of Gift on the Ground of Gross Ingratitude Act, No. 5 of 2017, which

provide that an irrevocable Deed of Gift may be revoked on the ground of

ingratitude in an action instituted by the donor against the donee within

ten years from the date of execution of the deed and within two years from

the date on which the cause of action arose.

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

Is the gift in question a donatio propter nuptias?

A donation propter nuptias cannot be revoked on gross ingratitude. In

Ponnamperume v. Goonesekera (1921) 23 NLR 235 the Supreme Court held

that “A donation propter nuptias is not revocable for ingratitude during the

subsistence of the marriage. But it may be revoked by a donor who has

reserved the power of revocation. A donation proper nuptias is not a mere gift

made on the occasion of a marriage, but a contract made as an inducement

to marry.”

The distinction between a donatio propter nuptias and an ordinary gift given

on the occasion of a marriage must be understood in the light of the unique

facts of each case, since the character of the donation depends upon the

intention of the donor and the surrounding circumstances.

In the celebrated case of Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera Menike v. Rohini

Senanayake [1992] 2 Sri LR 181, Amarasinghe J. highlighted the

distinction between a donatio propter nuptias and an ordinary gift given on

the occasion of a marriage. His Lordship observed that an ordinary donation

made on the occasion of a marriage, as an act of love and affection or for

the sake of enrichment, is a pure act of disinterested benevolence and

liberality, unconditionally given, without any sense of compulsion or

obligation, and without any further expectation or hope. In contrast, a

donatio propter nuptias is a gift made in contemplation of a marriage with a

view to enabling or supporting that marriage. It is given in consideration of

the marriage and not merely on the joyful occasion of the marriage.

His Lordship explained this at page 206 in this manner:

And so, a donatio propter nuptias is, in one sense, made in

consideration of marriage in that the transfer made is having regard to

the fact that a marriage shall be entered into. The property is given

because, in the sense that in order or so that, the marriage shall take

5

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

place. It is the reason why the marriage takes place. It is that which

brings about the promise of marriage or the wedding. The property is

given, more or less, as something akin to a payment, something given

in exchange, a quid pro quo, or reward or compensation. The transfer

is prompted by the promise or performance of something by the donee,

thereby making it a donatio non mera, and not a pure act of liberality

(donatio mera). In the case of a donatio propter nuptias, the property

may also be said to have been given in consideration of marriage, but

in the sense that it is given merely by reason of, or on account of, or

having regard to the fact or circumstance of, or motivated by, or on the

occasion of, the marriage. Perhaps the distinction between a donatio

propter nuptias and an ordinary gift given on the occasion of a marriage

might become somewhat clearer if I might say this: People do not marry

because of the wedding presents - the gifts - they might receive; nor are

wedding presents given to bring about the marriage. A wedding

present is a pure act of liberality, unconditionally given, without any

sense of compulsion or obligation, with no hope of recall or recovery if

the marriage does not take place. A donatio propter nuptias is not.

The Institutes by Rudolph Sohm (translated by James Crawford Ledlie), 3rd

Edition (Oxford Clarendon Press London 1907) at page 478 states:

A donation ante nuptias was thus primarily, not a gift in consideration

of natural affection, but a gift with a perfectly definite material object—

the object, namely, of endowing the future marriage with the requisite

pecuniary means.

In the instant case, there is no reference in the deed whatsoever to the 1ˢᵗ

Defendant’s marriage or to the property being given as dowry property.

There is no indication of any promise or inducement to marry. The Deed

itself states that the donation was made out of natural love and affection

and for the future enrichment of the donee: “මෙහි පහත සඳහන් උපමේඛණමෙහි

for future enrichment and a donation made in contemplation of marriage

as a donatio propter nuptias are not identical concepts.

The property was gifted subject to the life interest of the donor. This

reservation is cogently stated in the Deed: “හික්කඩුව ගලප්පත්තිමේ අමහ්ෂානි

මේනකා කුොරි ෙන අෙ ට ඉහත කී තෑගි දීෙනාකාර ෙමේ ජීවිතාන්තෙ දක්වා ෙනාප අන්දෙකින්

හිමිකේ පවරා දුනිමි.” It is noteworthy that, as submitted on behalf of the

Defendants, “the Defendants have no objection to including the life interest

of the Plaintiff’s husband and disabled sister as well.” In Ponnamperuma v.

Goonesekera (supra) at page 239, De Sampayo J. observed that “the nature

of the gift, if it is to be claimed as being of a special kind, should be disclosed

in the instrument itself”. In Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera Menike v. Rohini

Senanayake, Amarasinghe J., at page 213, regarded a reservation of life

interest of this nature as a factor inconsistent with a donatio propter

nuptias.

The transfer was subject to a life interest. The enjoyment of the

property was postponed. It was a case of dies cedit sed non venit. How

could the marriage be made attractive by a reduction of its burdens

when the right to enjoy the property and take its fruits, when the right

to remain in full and undisturbed possession and enjoy the produce

and profits of the Estate, remained, even after the marriage, exclusively

7

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

and undisturbed in the donors who had reserved to themselves a life

interest—an interest, incidentally, which the appellant-donor yet

enjoys, many years after the occasion of the marriage? The reservation

of a life interest showed that the conveyance was not propter nuptias.

In the case at hand, during cross-examination, the 1st Defendant admitted

that she was unaware of the contents of Deed P4 at the time she signed it,

stating that she accompanied her mother to the Notary’s office and merely

signed.

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

If this was a dotal gift, as the defendants now suggest, promised on the

occasion of the arranged marriage, the 1st defendant could not have been

unaware of that fact. She states that, since she had been told that the

property was given as a gift, she did not inquire further into the matter.

Having regard to the contents of the Deed P4, the reservation of life interest,

the absence of any reference whatsoever to marriage or dowry, the clear

recital that the donation was made out of natural love and affection for the

future enrichment of the donee, and the 1ˢᵗ defendant’s own admissions

under cross-examination that she neither inquired into the nature of the

transaction nor understood it to be a dowry or a gift made in contemplation

of marriage, there is no sufficient material on record to characterise this

transfer as a donatio propter nuptias. The evidence does not disclose any

inducement to marry or any quid pro quo of the nature contemplated in the

authorities. What emerges instead is a voluntary donation prompted by

natural love and affection, subject to the reservation of a life interest in

favour of the donor. The transaction is therefore consistent with a donatio

mera, rather than a donatio non mera. The defendants’ belated attempt to

recast it as a dotal gift lacks both documentary foundation and evidentiary

support.

Has gross ingratitude been proved?

In order to revoke a deed of gift, slight ingratitude is not sufficient. There

shall be gross ingratitude. No hard and fast rule can be laid down on what

constitutes gross ingratitude. It is a question of fact, not of law. The failure

9

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

to fulfil the conditions of the gift, such as that the donee shall provide

succour and assistance to the doner, is an incidence of gross ingratitude.

An assault on the donor by the donee is a clear instance of gross ingratitude.

A single act or a series of acts can constitute gross ingratitude. Depending

on the facts and circumstances of each case, for instance, threats to cause

bodily injury to the donor by the donee, continuous slander and insult,

damage to the donor’s property, ill-treatment of the donor can constitute

gross ingratitude. The onus of proof is on the donor and the standard of

proof is on a balance of probabilities.

Van Leeuwan’s Commentaries on Roman Dutch Law, Vol. II, Stevens and

Haynes (1986) at page 241 states:

§ 7. Donations again may also be revoked and cancelled by reason of

great ingratitude and injury done to the donor; as where the donee has

attempted the life of the donor, assaulted him, or publicly slandered

him, or has refused support to the donor who has been reduced to

poverty, and the like.

Laws of Ceylon by Walter Pereira, 2nd Edition (1913) at page 610 states:

A donation by its nature is irrevocable. This irrevocability is, however,

subject to some exceptions—(1) On the ground of gross ingratitude or

misbehaviour, as, for instance, when the donee attempts the life of the

donor, or strikes him, or attempts to ruin his estate. Malicious slander

or any other injury gives the same right, except to mothers who marry

a second time. Causes of equal or greater weight are also held to have

the same force; amongst others, the neglect of the donee, if he has the

means, to maintain the donor in his utmost need. …

In Sinnammah v. Nallanathar (1946) 47 NLR 32, the wife executed the Deed

of Gift in favour of the husband, which was expressly stated to be

irrevocable. On one occasion, the defendant assaulted her and fractured

10

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

her arm. Jayathileke J. held that “In the Roman-Dutch law there is the most

ample authority that a donation can be revoked if the donee assaults the

donor (Voet 39.5.22, Krause’s Translation, page 50; Grotius 3.2.17, Herbert’s

Translation page 286: Van Leeuwen 30.4.7, Kotze’s Translation, page 235; 2

Burge, page 146).” It was further held that, in any event, under the Roman-

Dutch law a donation inter vivos may be revoked if the donee assaults the

donor, although the latter may have agreed not to revoke it.

In Krishnaswamy v. Thillaiyampalam (1957) 59 NLR 265 at 269, Basnayake

C.J. stated:

It would be unwise to lay down a hard and fast rule as to what conduct

on the part of a donee may be regarded as ingratitude for which a

donor may ask for revocation of his gift. Voet’s view is that ingratitude

for which a donation may be revoked must be ingratitude which a court

does not regard as trifling. He says: “Of course slighter causes of

ingratitude are by no means enough to bring about a revocation.

Although both the laws and right reason entirely condemn every blot

and blemish of ingratitude, albeit somewhat slight, nevertheless they

have not intended that for that reason it should be forthwith penalized

by revocation of the gift.” The ways in which a donee may show that

he is ungrateful being legion, it is not possible to state what is “slight

ingratitude” and what is not, except in regard to the facts of a given

case. There is nothing in the books which lays down the rule that a

revocation may not be granted on the commission of a single act of

ingratitude. Ingratitude is a frame of mind which has to be inferred

from the donee’s conduct. Such an attitude of mind will be indicated

either by a single act or by a series of acts.

The case of Fernando v. Perera (1959) 63 NLR 236 establishes that a single

act of ingratitude may be sufficient to revoke a deed of gift. In that case, the

plaintiff, the foster mother of the defendant, her adopted son, alleged three

11

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

acts of ingratitude, namely an assault on her with a broomstick, a threat to

cause bodily harm, and damage to the house occupied by her. The District

Judge found that the plaintiff had exaggerated certain incidents. However,

he accepted her evidence relating to the threat to cause bodily injury, which

was corroborated by an independent witness. Nevertheless, he held that

this incident did not amount to ingratitude. The evidence revealed that the

defendant chased the plaintiff while threatening to kill her, compelling her

to seek refuge in the house of a third party, who testified: “When I was living

in the Tuduwe Road house, I remember the plaintiff coming running into my

house. I asked her why she came running, and she said that her son was

coming to kill her.” There was also evidence that the defendant had

attempted to dissuade this witness from giving evidence on behalf of the

plaintiff. Basnayake C.J., disagreeing with the conclusion of the District

Judge, held that “This incident by itself is sufficient to support the allegation

of ingratitude on the part of the defendant, and the plaintiff is therefore

entitled to the relief she seeks.”

In De Silva v. De Croos [2002] 2 Sri LR 409, Dissanayake J. set aside the

judgment of the District Court on the basis that “the learned District Judge

applied too strict a standard of proof. He has not applied correctly the test of

balance of probabilities in evaluating the evidence.”

In Dona Podi Nona Ranaweera’s case, at 220, Amarasinghe J. states:

A donor is entitled to revoke a donation on account of ingratitude (1) if

the donee lays manus impias on the donor; (2) if he does him an

atrocious injury; (3) if he wilfully causes him great loss of property; (4)

if he makes an attempt upon his life; (5) if he does not fulfil the

conditions attached to the gift. In addition, a gift may be revoked for

other, equally grave, causes.

12

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

Although the law recognises limited exceptions to the general rule that a

deed of gift is absolute and irrevocable, those exceptions are not lightly

invoked. The need for sufficient proof before a Court may be persuaded to

depart from the rule of irrevocability was underscored in Ariyawathie

Meemaduma v. Jeewani Budhdhika Meemaduma [2011] 1 Sri LR 124 at

133, where it was held:

A deed of gift is absolute and irrevocable. That is the rule. However the

law has recognized certain exceptions to the rule of irrevocability. A

party applying to Court to invoke the exceptions in his favour has to

satisfy court, by cogent evidence, that the court would be justified in

invoking the exception in favour of the party applying for the same. In

this case even if the appellant's evidence in the District Court is

considered alone (without any reference to the contents of documents

P4A and P4B) her evidence falls short of the standard of proof required

to invoke any recognized exception to defeat the rule of irrevocability.

A mere ipse dixit like “he threatened to kill me” is not sufficient to

discharge that burden.

In the instant case, after the property was gifted to the 1st Defendant

daughter subject to the life interest of the Plaintiff by Deed marked P4, the

1st Defendant gifted it to her minor son by Deed marked P7. In the latter

Deed, the 1ˢᵗ Defendant did not reserve life interest for her donor mother.

Instead, she reserved life interest for herself and for her husband. The

Plaintiff had not been informed of the execution of Deed P7. She became

aware of it only later, when the 1ˢᵗ Defendant, during a quarrel, mocked her

by saying that the property now no longer belonged to her. This prompted

the donor mother to inquire at the Land Registry and confirm the transfer

effected by Deed P7. This conduct on the part of the 1ˢᵗ Defendant is a

significant indication of gross ingratitude.

13

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

The Plaintiff, in her evidence, stated that she decided to lodge a complaint

with the police after the 1ˢᵗ Defendant had threatened her on several

occasions. In her complaint made to the police on 29.11.2006 marked P5,

the Plaintiff inter alia states:

death threats:

Sudharma Damayanthi, who resided in the adjoining house, gave evidence

for the Plaintiff. She stated that the 1ˢᵗ Defendant abused and blamed the

Plaintiff, her own mother, in language unbecoming of a child addressing a

parent. (ෙටත් අේො මකමනක් ඉන්නවාමන්. අේෙට කතා කරන විදිහට මනෙයි විත්තිකාරිෙ කතා

Justin Perera, another neighbour of the plaintiff had also confirmed this

behaviour of the 1st defendant.

The plaintiff’s son, who is also the 1ˢᵗ defendant’s brother and was a witness

to Deed P4, further corroborated the plaintiff’s version. He testified to acts

of hostility by the 1ˢᵗ defendant allegedly directed at compelling the plaintiff

and the family to vacate the residence, and stated that the 1ˢᵗ defendant had

neglected her parents despite the execution of the Deed of Gift in the hope

of future care and support.

The 1ˢᵗ defendant herself conceded that the disagreements between her and

the plaintiff mother escalated to a serious level:

දරුවාට වසරක් වුනාට පසු දැන් ඉන්න මගදරට එන්න විමශ්ෂ මහ්තුවක් සිදු වුනා. අේො

නිතරෙ පුරුෂොට බනිනවා මගදර වැඩ කරන්මන්නැහැ කිො. ෙෙ කිේවා පුරුෂොට බනින්න

එපා කිො. ඒ ෙත අේොමේ හිත මහාඳ නැතිව ගිො. අේො පුරුෂාට බනින විට ෙෙ එක

පැත්තක්වත් ගත්මත් නැහැ. ෙෙ අේෙට කිේවා පුරුෂොට බනින්න එපා ෙෙ හදාගගන්නේ

කිො. ඒ මවලාමේ අේො හිතුවා ෙෙ ඔහුමේ පැත්ත ගත්තා කිො. ඉන්පසු ආරවුේ දරුණු

අන්දෙට ගිො.

However, the learned High Court Judge appears not to have given due

attention to the evidence, probably because he proceeded on the erroneous

basis that the gift was a dotal gift, and thus not revocable even upon proof

of gross ingratitude.

The 1ˢᵗ Defendant had, on two separate occasions, left the property in

question after quarrelling with her mother, without any regard for the well-

being or financial needs of her mother, her father, or disabled sister. In her

own evidence, the 1ˢᵗ Defendant admitted that she had no contact with her

brother and that she had not visited her parents for a period of six years.

When the evidence is evaluated as a whole and on the standard of balance

of probabilities, the conduct of the 1ˢᵗ Defendant cannot be dismissed as

ordinary domestic disagreements or isolated incidents of strained family

relations. The execution of Deed P7 alienating the gifted property without

reserving the donor mother’s life interest and without informing her, the

taunting assertion that the property no longer belonged to the plaintiff,

threats of death, persistent verbal abuse directed at the donor, and the

prolonged neglect of aged and vulnerable parents, including an

incapacitated sister, disclose a sustained pattern of hostility and disregard

towards the donor. These acts, taken cumulatively, go beyond mere slight

ingratitude and amount to gross ingratitude of a serious nature, sufficient

in law to warrant the revocation of the Deed of Gift.

Conclusion

It is evident that the property gifted under Deed No. 5 was conveyed as an

ordinary gift and not as a dotal gift, since the marriage did not take place

in consideration of, or in exchange for, the property. The essential

17

SC/APPEAL/162/2019

requirement of a dowry, namely that the marriage is contracted in

consideration of the gift, is therefore absent. The conduct of the 1ˢᵗ

Defendant, as outlined above, establishes gross ingratitude towards the

donor on a balance of probabilities, which in law justifies the revocation of

Deed No. 5 and, as a necessary consequence, the nullification of Deed No.

In the totality of the facts and circumstances of this case, the High Court

ought not to have reversed the judgment of the District Court on the merits.

Accordingly, the questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted

are answered in the affirmative. The judgment of the High Court is set aside,

and the judgment of the District Court is restored. I make no order as to

costs.
