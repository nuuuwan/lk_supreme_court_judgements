Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant in the District

Court of Homagama seeking a declaration of title to the land described in

the schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the defendant therefrom, and

damages. The defendant filed answer seeking the dismissal of the plaintiff’s

action. After trial, the learned District Judge entered judgment for the

plaintiff as prayed for in the prayer to the plaint, except for damages.

SC/APPEAL/113/2018

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal set aside the judgment of the

District Court and dismissed the plaintiff’s action with costs, on the basis

that, “since the plaintiff had gifted the property in suit to the substituted

plaintiff while the action was pending and thereafter died, the cause of action

did not survive.”

This Court granted leave to appeal against the judgment of the High Court

on the following question of law:

Did the High Court err in law by failing to consider section 404 of the

Civil Procedure Code before dismissing the plaintiff’s action?

It is common ground that, as the plaintiff was ill, the appellant was

substituted in place of the plaintiff in the District Court. It is also

undisputed that, while the action was pending before the District Court, the

plaintiff transferred the property in suit to the appellant by deed No. 465

dated 19.06.1994. Midway through the trial, the plaintiff died, whereupon

the appellant made an application to the District Court under section 404

of the Civil Procedure Code to be named as the added plaintiff. The

defendant objected to this application.

By order dated 24.03.2009, the learned District Judge, citing Eugin

Fernando v. Charles Perera [1988] II CALR 37, held that the transfer of the

property pendente lite did not constitute an impediment to the maintenance

of the action and that the appellant was entitled to continue the proceedings

in terms of section 404 of the Civil Procedure Code. The Court further

observed that there was no necessity to rename the appellant as an added

plaintiff, as he had already been substituted in place of the original plaintiff.

The defendant did not appeal against this order. The trial thereafter

proceeded, and judgment was ultimately delivered.

Section 404 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

4

SC/APPEAL/113/2018

In other cases of assignment, creation, or devolution of any interest

pending the action, the action may, with the leave of the court, given

either with the consent of all parties or after service of notice in writing

upon them, and hearing their objections, if any, be continued by or

against the person to whom such interest has come, either in addition

to or in substitution for the person from whom it has passed, as the

case may require.

In Arumugam Rasalingam v. Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development

Corporation (SC/APPEAL/17/2016, SC Minutes of 16.12.2022), I had

occasion to consider the legal implications of a plaintiff alienating title

pendente lite in a rei vindicatio action, in the context of conflicting judicial

authority on the point. Upon a careful analysis of the relevant principles

and authorities, I reached the following conclusion:

There is no rationale for the proposition of law that in a vindicatory suit,

the action must fail the moment the plaintiff transfers title pending

action (except to say that it is a principle of the Roman Dutch Law as

articulated by Voet) when section 404 of the Civil Procedure Code

expressly enacts that in the case of assignment, creation or devolution

of any interest in the subject matter of a pending action, the Court has

the discretion to admit parties as plaintiffs or defendants after

affording a hearing to all parties to the action. It is up to the Court to

exercise that discretion judicially taking into consideration the facts

and circumstances of each case.

This conclusion accords with the decision in Eugin Fernando v. Charles

Perera, on which the learned District Judge rightly placed reliance.

The High Court failed to consider the provisions of section 404 of the Civil

Procedure Code when it dismissed the plaintiff’s action on the footing that

the alienation of title pendente lite resulted in the extinction of the cause of

5

SC/APPEAL/113/2018

action upon the death of the transferor. Such an approach is legally

unsustainable.

I accordingly answer the question of law on which leave to appeal was

granted in the affirmative. The judgment of the High Court is set aside, and

the judgment of the District Court is restored. The parties shall bear their

own costs.
