Decided on : 02-02-2026

Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the 9th defendant–appellant-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the 9th defendant) on being aggrieved of the

judgment pronounced on 02-12-2015 by the Provincial High Court of Western

Province holden in Colombo while exercising its civil appellate jurisdiction.

From the impugned judgment, the learned Judges of the High Court decided

to dismiss the appeal preferred by the 9th defendant challenging the judgment

dated 10-11-2009 pronounced by the learned Additional District Judge of

Colombo in District Court of Colombo Partition Case No. 18076/P.

In the said judgment, it was held by the learned Additional District Judge that

the 9th defendant’s claim of prescription and the claim seeking compensation

for the improvements done to the building standing on the corpus of the

partition action have not been established

Page 9 of 13

From the impugned judgment as well, the High Court held that the 9th

defendant has failed to prove the prescriptive claim made to a part of the land

sought to be partitioned, and has also failed to adduce sufficient evidence for

the trial Court to consider her claim of compensation.

When this matter was considered by this Court on 14-07-2020 for the

granting of leave to appeal from the impugned judgment, leave was granted

on the questions of law as set out in sub-paragraphs i, ii, iii of paragraph 23

of the petition dated 22-12-2015.

It clearly appears that the Court has granted leave to appeal only on the

questions of law relating to the compensation claim made by the 9th defendant

and not on any other basis.

The said questions of law under which leave to appeal was allowed read as

follows.

i. Did the Civil Appellate High Court err in law with regard to the claim

for compensation in respect of the room put up by Abdul Hussain

consequent to the settlement in “9D2” with the 1st defendant.

ii. Whether the said improvement being a bona fide improvement would

entail payment of compensation to the improver.

iii. Did the High Court err in law by denying compensation for the

improvements done by Abdul Hussain, especially after the destruction

caused in 1983 riots, without any legal basis.

At the hearing of this appeal, this Court heard the submissions of the learned

President’s Counsel who represented the 9th defendant and the submissions

of the learned Counsel who represented the plaintiff-respondent-respondents.

This Court also heard the submissions of the learned President’s Counsel

made on behalf of the 1st and 8th defendant-respondent-respondents and that

of the learned President’s Counsel who represented 3A, 4th, 5th and 6th

defendant-respondent-respondents. Parties were also permitted to file post-

argument written submissions for consideration, if they so wish.

Page 10 of 13

This is a matter where the plaintiff-respondent-respondents (hereinafter

referred to as the plaintiffs) instituted action to partition the land morefully

described in their plaint between the parties entitled to undivided shares of

the land.

The 9th defendant, by her amended claim dated 05-10-2005, has claimed

prescription to a portion of the land sought to be partitioned on the basis that

her father Mohideen Peer Abdul Hussain acquired prescriptive rights to the

said portion and the building standing thereon. At the same time, she has

claimed compensation for the improvements done by her father. Her claim

has been based on the premise that she is one of the 9 children of the said

Abdul Hussain.

It appears that her claim for prescription has been based on the stand that

her father paid money to buy the said portion of the land subsequent to him

gaining possession of it, and also based on the agreement marked 9D2 where

the father of the 1st defendant-respondent-respondent has entered into an

agreement with the earlier mentioned Abdul Hussain to construct an upstairs

unit in the land at his expense.

Although the learned President’s Counsel made submissions as to the defects

of the partition action in relation to the identity of the corpus and the title, I

am of the view that since the questions of law under which leave to appeal

have been granted by this Court relate only as to the question of

compensation, considering other matters would not be necessary for the

purpose of determining this appeal.

It was the submission of the learned President’s Counsel who represented the

9th defendant that although the learned District Judge has answered the

points of contest as to the improvements and compensation stating that it has

not been proved, he has failed to give reasons as to why it was determined so.

It was submitted that the 9th defendant has given uncontradicted evidence as

to the value of the improvements made by her father, and the learned District

Judge has neither rejected nor considered the said evidence.

Page 11 of 13

It was also his submission that there was clear evidence to conclude that it

was the father of the 9th defendant who made improvements to the building

bearing No. 20, and the District Court, as well as the High Court in its

appellate judgment, have failed to give due weight to the said evidence when

the compensation claim was rejected.

It is clear that the 9th defendant is claiming compensation for the building

with the assessment No. 20 as depicted in plan No. 199/2001 dated 20-07-

2001 by Surveyor S. Rasappah, which is the preliminary plan prepared for

the purposes of the partition action. The said assessment number has been

depicted as Lot 1 of the preliminary plan. Although it was claimed that the 9th

defendant adduced sufficient evidence to establish her claim for

improvements, I find no basis to agree with such a contention.

In her statement of claim, she has sought Rs. 10 million as compensation for

improvements. It is trite law that a person who is claiming compensation for

improvements must prove the same with sufficient evidence as to the basis

for such a claim.

In Thambachchi Ramiah Mallikanu Letchchumi Vs. Bambarendage

Jimoris Jinadasa SC/Appeal/151/2013,

The Respondent has claimed compensation for the improvements made on

the house which was in the land in dispute. It was an admitted fact that the

said house was there when the title was passed on to the Respondent.

According to the schedule of the said deed No. 804, the Respondent has got

title to the land together with the trees, plantations and building thereon

bearing assessment No. 255, Vihara Mawatha. Issue No. 14 has been raised

on the claim for the improvements.”

Per Upali Abeyrathne, J.,

“The learned District Judge has concluded that the Respondent has

failed to prove the improvements. Other than the Respondent’s mere

statement that he spent about ten lakhs on the improvements to the

house standing on the land in dispute, there was no iota of evidence in

order to compute the quantum of the compensation… When I take into

Page 12 of 13

consideration the said evidence of the Respondent’s case, I cannot find

fault with the findings of the learned District Judge.”

Although it appears that the learned District Judge has not evaluated the

evidence in much detail as to the claim of compensation, it is manifestly clear

from the judgment of the learned Judges of the High Court that the 9th

defendant’s compensation claim has been well considered giving attention to

the evidence led before the trial Court in that regard.

In her evidence, the 9th defendant has made a mere statement where she has

claimed that her father may have spent about Rs. 10 lakhs for the

improvements. Other than that, she has not been able to substantiate her

claim in any manner. The 9th defendant’s claim for compensation has been

based on the alleged improvements done to the building by her father,

whereas she has failed to adduce any evidence in that regard as well.

Although it was the stand of the learned President’s Counsel that her evidence

has not been controverted by the other parties, and therefore, it should have

been accepted for the purposes of determining compensation, I am in full

agreement with the learned Judge of the High Court that whether the evidence

is controverted or not, there should be sufficient evidence before the trial

Court for a trial Judge to determine the quantum of compensation that should

be awarded where a claim for compensation can be justified.

Under no circumstances the mere oral statement by the 9th defendant can be

accepted as a sufficient basis to order compensation. The 9th defendant has

even failed to mention to the Court the details of the alleged improvements

under which she claims compensation.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no reason to interfere with the

judgment of the learned Judges of the High Court.

Accordingly, I answer the 3 questions of law under which leave to appeal was

granted in the negative.

The appeal is dismissed. The parties shall bear their own costs.
