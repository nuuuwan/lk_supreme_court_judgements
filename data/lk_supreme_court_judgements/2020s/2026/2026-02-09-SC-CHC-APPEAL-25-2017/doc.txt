Introduction

The plaintiff instituted this action in the District Court of Colombo

against the 1ˢᵗ defendant, Sri Lanka Ports Management and Consultancy

Services Ltd., and the 2ⁿᵈ defendant, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, seeking

to recover a sum of Rs. 104 million for the period from 29.03.2004 to

29.05.2006, together with a further sum of Rs. 4 million per month from

30.05.2006 to 19.01.2009. The action was subsequently transferred to

the Commercial High Court of Colombo.

3

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

Both the 1ˢᵗ and 2ⁿᵈ defendants filed separate answers praying for the

dismissal of the plaintiff’s action. Upon conclusion of trial, the Judge of

the Commercial High Court, by judgment dated 06.03.2017, awarded the

plaintiff a sum of Rs. 28,902,456.92 as damages for breach of contract

marked P10, committed by the 1ˢᵗ defendant, and dismissed the action

against the 2ⁿᵈ defendant.

Aggrieved by the said judgment, the 1ˢᵗ defendant has preferred this

appeal.

Plaintiff’s case

The plaintiff’s case, in brief, is as follows.

The Port of Colombo comprises two principal terminals, namely the

Queen Elizabeth Quay and the Jaya Container Terminal. By a written

agreement entered into on 05.09.1999, the 2ⁿᵈ defendant and a company

known as South Asia Gateway Terminals Ltd. agreed that South Asia

Gateway Terminals Ltd. would operate and manage the Queen Elizabeth

Quay for a period of thirty years. Thereafter, the Queen Elizabeth Quay

came to be known as the South Asia Gateway Terminal. The operation

and management of the Jaya Container Terminal, on the other hand,

remained with the 2ⁿᵈ defendant.

The 2ⁿᵈ defendant is the majority shareholder of the 1ˢᵗ defendant, and

the 1ˢᵗ defendant is engaged, inter alia, in activities relating to port

management at the instance of the 2ⁿᵈ defendant.

In or around the year 2003, inter-terminal trucking services between the

Jaya Container Terminal and South Asia Gateway Terminal, and vice

versa, were provided by a company known as Sea Consortium Lanka

(Pvt) Ltd. Thereafter, the defendants decided to appoint an alternative

service provider for inter-terminal trucking and called for tenders for that

purpose.

4

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

The tender was awarded to the plaintiff, and a written agreement dated

16.01.2004 marked P10, was entered into between the 1ˢᵗ defendant and

the plaintiff, to be operative for the period from 20.01.2004 to

19.01.2007. Pursuant thereto, the plaintiff received orders to provide

inter-terminal trucking services from 20.01.2004 to 05.03.2004.

On 05.03.2004, the operations of the plaintiff were suspended by the 2ⁿᵈ

defendant in compliance with an interim order issued by the Supreme

Court in Case No. SC/FR/105/2004. That interim order was

subsequently vacated on 29.03.2004.

It is the case of the plaintiff that it entered into the agreement marked

P10 on the basis of representations made by the defendants that 50% of

the inter-terminal trucking business would be allocated to the plaintiff

during the contractual period. However, according to the plaintiff, no

orders were received after 29.03.2004. On that basis, the plaintiff claims

that the defendants acted in violation of the agreement marked P10 and

sought the aforesaid damages from the 1ˢᵗ and 2ⁿᵈ defendants jointly

and/or severally.

Defendants’ Position

The principal positions taken up by the defendants in their respective

answers may be summarised as follows.

Firstly, it is pleaded that inter-terminal trucking services between the

Queen Elizabeth Quay, which is operated and managed by South Asia

Gateway Terminals Ltd., and the Jaya Container Terminal, which is

operated and managed by the 2ⁿᵈ defendant, are administered by the

Colombo Inter-Terminal Office. The Colombo Inter-Terminal Office, it is

stated, was established pursuant to the Inter-Terminal Operations

Agreement entered into between South Asia Gateway Terminals Ltd. and

the 2ⁿᵈ defendant. On that basis, the defendants maintain that the 1ˢᵗ

defendant was not responsible for placing or issuing orders for inter-

terminal trucking services with the plaintiff.

5

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

Secondly, the defendants contend that, in any event, the agreement

marked P10 does not contain any clause entitling the plaintiff to 50% of

the inter-terminal trucking services during the contractual period.

Grounds of Appeal

Before this Court, the 1ˢᵗ defendant-appellant argued the appeal on three

main grounds. They are as follows:

(a) that responsibility for the placement of orders for inter-terminal

trucking services lay with the Colombo Inter-Terminal Office and

not with the 1ˢᵗ defendant, and that the 1ˢᵗ defendant therefore

cannot be held liable for the failure to order such services from the

plaintiff;

(b) that the agreement marked P10 contains no term, express or

implied, assuring the plaintiff of 50% of the inter-terminal trucking

services during the contractual period; and

(c) that the award of damages made by the Commercial High Court is

erroneous in law and in fact.

I now proceed to consider these grounds in turn.

Whether CITO was responsible

The contention advanced on behalf of the 1ˢᵗ defendant that inter-

terminal trucking services between the two terminals were handled by

the Colombo Inter-Terminal Office, and that the 1ˢᵗ defendant was

therefore not responsible for ordering such services from the plaintiff,

cannot be sustained having regard to the terms of the agreement marked

P10.

There is no dispute that the agreement marked P10 was entered into

exclusively between the 1ˢᵗ defendant and the plaintiff. It is not a tripartite

agreement involving the 1ˢᵗ defendant, the plaintiff, and the Colombo

Inter-Terminal Office. Further, the Colombo Inter-Terminal Office is

6

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

neither a natural person nor a juristic person. It is merely an

administrative office established for operational convenience.

Clause 3 of the agreement marked P10, which delineates the scope of

services, reads as follows:

3. Scope of the Services

The Contractor [the plaintiff] shall provide for the benefit of the Sri

Lanka Ports Authority [the 2nd defendant], SAGT [South Asia

Gateway Terminals Ltd.] and SLPMCS LTD [the 1st defendant].

a. Trucking of inter terminal containers from Sri Lanka Ports

Authority terminal and SAGT and vice versa;

b. Trucking of other containers between SAGT terminal and the

Ports Authority terminal and vice versa as may be required

from time to time;

On a 24 hour basis for 365 days of any calendar year during the

planned movement periods.

The role of the Colombo Inter-Terminal Office is addressed in clause 4.3

of the agreement. Clause 4.3(a) provides that “CITO will be the first point

of contact the Contractor shall have with SLPMCS Ltd. and the Sri Lanka

Ports Authority on all matters pertaining to this Agreement.”

Clause 4.3, read as a whole, provides as follows:

4.3 Compliance with Operating Procedures

a. CITO will be the first point of contact the Contractor shall have

with SLPMCS LTD and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority on all

matters pertaining to this Agreement.

b. Designated officers of CITO will be responsible for ordering the

services to be provided on a day to day basis by way of Inter-

Terminal Trucking and the Contractor shall ensure that such

orders are followed efficiently and expeditiously without delay.

7

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

c. The Contractor shall ensure that its supervisory personal liaise

with CITO at all times in carrying out the obligations under this

Agreement.

It is evident that the designation of the Colombo Inter-Terminal Office as

the “first point of contact” was intended to facilitate coordination and

communication for the smooth functioning of operations and does not

attract contractual liability. Such delegation of coordinating and

operational functions does not displace or dilute the contractual

responsibility of the 1ˢᵗ defendant, who remains the contracting party

bound by the terms of the agreement.

This conclusion is reinforced by clause 5 of the agreement, which

stipulates that payments to the plaintiff shall be made by the 1ˢᵗ

defendant in the manner set out in Schedule 1. No liability for payment

is cast upon the Colombo Inter-Terminal Office or any other entity.

For these reasons, I reject the first ground of appeal.

Claim of 50% of inter-terminal tracking services

It is the case of the plaintiff that, at the time of entering into the

agreement marked P10, both the 1ˢᵗ and 2ⁿᵈ defendants expressly

represented and undertook that the plaintiff would be provided with

orders amounting to approximately 50% of the inter-terminal trucking

activities carried out within the Port of Colombo. The position of the 1ˢᵗ

defendant, on the other hand, is that the agreement contains no such

express term and no such representation was made at the time of signing

the agreement.

The plaintiff responds by asserting that such an arrangement constituted

an implied term of the agreement.

The learned High Court Judge, having examined the terms of the

agreement and, in particular, the document marked P11, concluded that

the intention of the parties at the time of entering into the agreement was

8

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

that the plaintiff would secure 50% of the inter-terminal trucking

services, while the remaining 50% would be handled by Sea Consortium

Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.

Before examining whether that conclusion is sustainable, it is necessary

to state the legal position relating to implied terms in contracts. An

implied term is one which, though not expressly stated, is read into a

contract in order to give effect to the presumed intention of the parties

or to ensure the business efficacy of the agreement. Such a term may be

implied where it is necessary to make the contract workable, where it is

so obvious that it goes without saying, or where it may be inferred from

the conduct of the parties or the surrounding circumstances at the time

of contracting. An implied term, once properly established, is as binding

as an express term of the contract.

In Amalgamated Investment & Property Co. Ltd. v. Texas Commerce

International Bank Ltd. [1982] QB 84, the English Court of Appeal

recognised that the subsequent conduct of the parties may give rise to

an estoppel by convention, thereby precluding them from resiling from a

shared assumption as to the meaning of their agreement, even where

that assumption does not accord with the true construction of the

written contract. In explaining this principle, Lord Denning M.R. stated:

So here we have available to us, in point of practice if not in law,

evidence of subsequent conduct to come to our aid. It is available,

not so to construe the contract, but to see how they themselves acted

upon it. Under the guise of estoppel we can prevent either party from

going back on the interpretation they themselves gave to it.

There is no need to inquire whether their particular interpretation is

correct or not, whether they were mistaken or not, or whether they

had in mind the original terms or not. Suffice it that they have by the

course of dealing, put their own interpretation on their contract, and

cannot be allowed to go back on it.

9

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

A well-established test for the implication of a term in fact is that of

“business efficacy”. The leading early authority on this principle is The

Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64, where Bowen L.J., at page 68, articulated

what has since come to be known as the business efficacy test in the

following terms:

[W]hat the law desires to effect by the implication is to give such

business efficacy to the transaction as much have been intended at

all events by both parties who are businessmen; not to impose on

one side all the perils of the transaction, or to emancipate one side

from all the chances of failure, but to make each party promise in

law as much, at all events, as it must have been in the contemplation

of both parties that he should be responsible for in respect of those

perils or chances.

Closely allied to the test of business efficacy is the officious bystander

test. The classic formulation of this test was articulated by MacKinnon

L.J. in Shirlaw v. Southern Foundries Ltd. [1939] 2 KB 206 at 207, where

it was held that a term may be implied only if it is so obvious that it goes

without saying. He expressed the principle in the following terms:

Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be implied and need

not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes without

saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their bargain, an

officious bystander were to suggest some express provision for it in

their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common

‘Oh, of course!’

Lord Wright in Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd v. Cooper [1941] AC 108 at 137

described an implied term as one “of which it can be predicated that ‘it

goes without saying’ some term not expressed but necessary to give the

transaction such business efficacy as the parties may have intended.”

In B.P. Refinery (Westernport) Pty. Ltd. v. Shire of Hastings [1978] 52 ALJR

20, Lord Simon of Glaisdale set out five conditions for the implication of

10

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

terms in fact into a contract, stating that “for a term to be implied, the

following conditions (which may overlap) must be satisfied: (1) it must be

reasonable and equitable (2) it must be necessary to give business efficacy

to the contract, so that no term will be implied if the contract is effective

without it; it must be so obvious that ‘it goes without saying’; (4) it must be

capable of clear expression; (5) it must not contradict any express term of

the contract.”

In Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co. (Ramsbottom) Ltd. and Elton Cop

Dyeing Co. Ltd. [1918] 1 KB 592, Scrutton L.J. observed:

A term can only be implied if it is necessary in a business sense to

give efficacy to the contract; that is, if it is such a term that it can be

confidently said that if at the time the contract was being negotiated

someone has said to the parties “What will happen in such a case?”,

they would have replied: “Of course, so and so will happen; we did

not trouble to say that; it is too clear”

In Trollope v. North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board [1973] 2

All ER 260, Lord Pearson, at page 268, held:

An unexpressed term can be implied if and only if the court finds

that the parties must have intended that term to form part of their

contract: it is not enough for the court to find that such a term would

have been adopted by the parties as reasonable men if it had been

suggested to them: it must have been a term that went without

saying, a term necessary to give business efficacy to the contract, a

term which, although tacit, formed part of the contract which the

parties made for themselves.

What must be established is business necessity, not reasonableness or

fairness. In Marks and Spencer plc v. BNP Paribas Securities Services

Trust Co. (Jersey) Ltd. [2015] 3 WLR 1843, the Supreme Court of the

United Kingdom emphasised that a term may be implied in fact only

where it is necessary to give the contract business efficacy, and not

11

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

merely because it would be reasonable, fair, or commercially desirable to

do so. The Court underscored that the implication of a term is a strict

exercise, to be undertaken only after construing the express terms of the

contract, and that the tests of business efficacy and the officious

bystander are complementary tools directed at the same inquiry of

necessity. Particularly in the case of a detailed and professionally drafted

contract, a term will not be implied unless the contract would lack

practical or commercial coherence without it.

On the facts of the instant case, the task of the Court was easy. Clause

2 of the agreement marked P10 stipulates that the agreement comes into

operation on 20.01.2004. The document marked P11 was issued shortly

thereafter, on 26.01.2004. P11 is an internal circular issued by the 2ⁿᵈ

defendant to its officers, setting out the manner in which inter-terminal

trucking was to be carried out following the commencement of the

agreement. According to P11, containers unloaded at the Jaya Container

Terminal were to be transported to the South Asia Gateway Terminal by

the plaintiff, while containers unloaded at the South Asis Gateway

Terminal were to be transported to the Jaya Container Terminal by Sea

Consortium Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.

The sole witness called on behalf of the 2ⁿᵈ defendant admitted in

evidence that the document marked P11 reflected the policy adopted by

the 2ⁿᵈ defendant in relation to inter-terminal trucking operations

following the execution of the agreement marked P10.

In the light of this contemporaneous document, it cannot be said that

the learned High Court Judge acted unreasonably in concluding that the

intention of the parties, at the time of entering into the agreement

marked P10, was that the inter-terminal trucking operations would be

shared between the plaintiff and Sea Consortium Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.,

broadly on an equal basis.

That said, it is necessary to clarify that the plaintiff’s entitlement does

not strictly depend on a numerical allocation of 50%. On a proper

12

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

construction of the agreement read together with the surrounding

circumstances, the plaintiff was at the very least entitled to expect that

it would be entrusted with the entirety of inter-terminal trucking services

from the Jaya Container Terminal to the South Asia Gateway Terminal,

as contemplated at the inception of the contractual arrangement.

Accordingly, the absence of an express clause stipulating a precise

percentage allocation does not defeat the plaintiff’s claim, as the

arrangement was implicit in the agreement and confirmed by the

contemporaneous conduct of the defendants. This was an implied term

of the agreement.

For these reasons, I reject the second ground of appeal as well.

Damages

Damages for breach of contract are intended, so far as money can do, to

place the injured party in the position in which he would have been had

the contract been duly performed, and not to put him in a better position

or to punish the defendant. A breach of contract is a civil wrong and not

a criminal offence.

In Sri Lanka Omnibus Co. Ltd. v. L.A. Perera (1951) 53 NLR 265 at 268,

Lord Normand remarked:

The party complaining of a breach of contract is not entitled to be

put in a better position than he would have enjoyed if the contract

had been performed according to its terms.

In Robinson v. Harman (1848) 154 ER 363, Parke B. stated:

The rule of the common law is, that where a party sustains loss by

reason of a breach of contract, he is, so far as money can do it, to

be placed in the same situation, with respect to damages, as if the

contract had been performed.

13

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

The term liquidated damages is used where the parties to a contract have

agreed in advance upon a fixed sum payable, or a method of calculation,

as damages in the event of a specified breach. Where the contract does

not prescribe a sum or method for the assessment of damages, the

damages are unliquidated and must be ascertained by the court in

accordance with the general principles of contract law, namely by

awarding compensation for losses which arise naturally from the breach

or which may reasonably be supposed to have been within the

contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into.

Parties to a contract may also stipulate liquidated damages in respect of

a particular breach, while leaving claims arising from other breaches to

be determined as unliquidated damages in the ordinary way.

The burden lies on the claimant to establish such loss on a balance of

probabilities, and the assessment must be founded on evidence and

reasonable inference, rather than on conjecture.

In Kennedy v. Emden [1997] 2 EGLR 137, Nourse L.J. held that

“Compensation is a reward for real, not hypothetical, loss. It is not to be

made an occasion for recovery in respect of a loss which might have been,

but has not been, suffered.” This approach was also affirmed in Ruxley

Electronics v. Forsyth [1996] AC 344, where Lord Mustill emphasised that

damages must reflect the true loss actually suffered, not a theoretical or

artificial measure of loss.

The measure of such damages is the net value of the benefit of which the

claimant has been deprived, and not gross receipts or gross expectations.

This reflects what is described as the “net loss rule”, namely that courts

assess the claimant’s overall net loss by allowing countervailing gains or

savings to offset gross losses. (Neil Andrews, Contractual Duties:

Performance, Breach, Termination and Remedies, 1st Edition 2011, page

374)

In Omak Maritime Ltd v. Mamola Challenger Shipping Co [2011] 2 All ER

(Comm) 155, it was held:

14

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

In a typical claim for damages for breach of contract on the

expectancy basis both expected profits and necessary expenses

will be taken into account. The claimant will claim a sum equal to

the benefit he expected to earn from performance of the contract

less the costs he would have had to have incurred in order to earn

that benefit, which costs would include not only any sum he would

have had to pay to the party in breach but also any expenses he

would have had to incur in preparation for performance of the

contract. Damages calculated in that way would put the claimant

in the position he would have been in had the contract been

performed. The measure of loss thus compensates for the loss of

bargain and in doing so takes account of the expenses the claimant

would have incurred in reliance on the contract being performed.

To ignore those expenses when assessing damages would put the

claimant in a better position than he would have been in had the

contract been performed.

In Cullinane v. British “Rema” Manufacturing Co. Ltd. [1954] 1 Q.B. 292,

the Court of Appeal held that damages must place the claimant, so far

as money can do so, in the position he would have been in had the

contract been performed, and that an award which results in

overcompensation is erroneous. The court emphasised that claims for

capital loss and loss of profit are alternative and not cumulative, and

that the claimant cannot recover both. Accordingly, excessive damages

were reduced, and the assessment of loss of profit had to reflect the true

compensatory principle and avoid duplication or inflation of loss.

When calculating damages, the duty cast upon the claimant must also

be taken into account. Losses which could reasonably have been avoided

are not recoverable. In British Westinghouse Electric v. Underground

Electric Railways [1912] AC 673 at 689, the House of Lords held that

damages are intended to compensate for pecuniary loss naturally flowing

from the breach, subject to the duty to mitigate, and that a claimant

15

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

cannot recover loss attributable to his failure to take reasonable steps to

reduce that loss.

It must be recognised that the assessment of damages for loss of earnings

or loss of profit in cases of this nature is often a complex exercise, even

where an agreed contractual formula exists. This is because such

assessment necessarily involves projections and assumptions based on

past performance and probable future conduct. However, the complexity

of the exercise cannot justify a total refusal to award compensation once

a breach of contract has been established.

Chitty on Contracts, Vol. I, 23ʳᵈ edition 2018, para. 26-012, pp. 1799-

1800 states:

The fact that damages are difficult to assess does not disentitle the

claimant to compensation for loss resulting from the defendant’s

breach of contract. Where it is clear that the claimant has suffered

substantial loss, but the evidence does not enable it to be precisely

quantified, the court will assess damages as best it can on the

available evidence. The fact that the amount of that loss cannot be

precisely ascertained does not deprive the claimant of a remedy.

The loss of profits suffered by a claimant as the result of the

defendant’s breach of contract frequently depends on many

speculative factors, but the courts will always attempt to assess the

amount of the loss.

This approach was affirmed in One Step (Support) Ltd v. Morris-Garner

[2019] AC 649, where the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held at

page 673 that the court must select the method of assessment most apt

to secure compensation for the true loss suffered, and, quoting Chitty

with approval, further stated at page 674 that where precise

quantification is impossible, the court must nevertheless assess

damages on the best available evidence.

16

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

In Westminster (Duke) v. Swinton [1948] 1 KB 524, Denning J. stated that

“the real question in each case is: What damage has the plaintiff really

suffered from the breach?”

Where the claimant proves a breach but no substantial loss, only

nominal damages may be awarded. However, where substantial loss is

established but precise computation is difficult, the court is entitled and

required to make a reasonable and cautious estimate so as to

compensation.

In the instant case, the agreement marked P10 does not provide for any

agreed method or formula for the calculation of damages in the event of

a breach. Schedule 1 of the agreement merely stipulates the applicable

rates of payment for services rendered. In such circumstances, damages

must be assessed in accordance with general principles of contract law.

The learned High Court Judge concluded that the plaintiff had

established, on a balance of probability, that it was entitled to recover

from the 1ˢᵗ defendant a sum of Rs. 28,902,456.92 together with legal

interest from the date of institution of the action until payment in full.

I find that the grievance of the 1ˢᵗ defendant on this point is not directed

at the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages as such, but at the manner in

which the quantum was calculated.

It is undisputed that following the execution of the agreement, the

plaintiff’s services were in fact utilised in terms of the agreement and that

the plaintiff discharged its contractual obligations to the satisfaction of

the defendants. For the period from 20.01.2004 to 05.03.2004, a period

of approximately forty-five days, the 1ˢᵗ defendant paid the plaintiff a sum

of Rs. 1,810,030 for inter-terminal trucking services rendered, as

evidenced by cheques marked P13A to P13C. That sum represents the

gross receipts earned by the plaintiff during that period.

17

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

However, that amount cannot be treated as net profit. The obligations of

the plaintiff under the agreement are set out, inter alia, in clauses 4.1

and 4.2, which required the plaintiff to deploy twelve prime movers

together with other equipment, fuel, maintenance, and manpower in

order to perform its contractual duties. The costs associated with such

operations necessarily had to be borne by the plaintiff out of the sums

received. The learned High Court Judge did not deduct, or make

allowance for, such expenses and proceeded on the footing that the gross

receipts represented net earnings. This approach is erroneous, as

damages for loss of profit must be assessed on the basis of net profit and

not gross receipts.

Chitty on Contract, op. cit., para. 26-018, p. 1802, states “If the exact loss

cannot be determined, the court may have to use the nearest available

measure.”

In the absence of precise evidence as to the actual operational expenses

incurred by the plaintiff, but bearing in mind the nature of the

contractual obligations and the fact that the plaintiff did in fact perform

the contract efficiently during the initial period, I consider it reasonable

and fair to assess the plaintiff’s net profit at 50% of the gross receipts

proved. On that basis, the plaintiff’s net profit for the forty-five day period

would amount to Rs. 905,015.

On a proportional basis, this yields an estimated net monthly profit of

approximately Rs. 603,343. Applying this figure to the unexpired portion

of the contract from 29.03.2004 to 19.01.2007, a period of approximately

thirty-four months, the plaintiff’s total loss of profit would amount to Rs.

20,514,662.

However, having regard to the inherent uncertainties involved in

projecting earnings over an extended contractual period, including

possible fluctuations in volume of work and operational contingencies,

and in order to avoid any element of overcompensation, it is appropriate

to adopt a cautious approach. Doing so, I determine that a sum of Rs.

18

SC/CHC/APPEAL/25/2017

16,000,000 represents fair and reasonable compensation for the loss of

profit suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the breach of contract by the

1ˢᵗ defendant.

Accordingly, I hold that the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the 1ˢᵗ

defendant a sum of Rs. 16,000,000, together with legal interest thereon

from the date of institution of the action until payment in full.

Conclusion

For the reasons set out above, I hold that the learned High Court Judge

correctly found that the 1ˢᵗ defendant was in breach of the agreement

marked P10 and that the plaintiff is entitled to damages arising from

such breach. However, the quantification of damages made by the

learned High Court Judge cannot be sustained in its entirety, as it

proceeded on an erroneous basis by treating gross receipts as net profit.

Upon a reassessment of the evidence on record and applying settled

principles governing the award of damages for breach of contract, I

determine that the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the 1ˢᵗ defendant a

sum of Rs. 16,000,000, together with legal interest thereon from the date
