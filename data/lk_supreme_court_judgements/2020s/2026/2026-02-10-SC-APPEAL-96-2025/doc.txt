Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant in the District

Court of Kesbewa seeking the ejectment of the defendant from the premises

described in the schedule to the plaint and damages, on the ground that

the defendant is an overholding lessee who has remained in unlawful

occupation of the premises after 31.12.2018. In the plaint itself, the plaintiff

sought an enjoining order followed by an interim injunction, not to eject the

defendant from the premises pending the determination of the action, but

to restrain the defendant from continuing the business in the premises and

from earning profits until the final determination of the action.

The learned District Judge, in the first instance, issued the enjoining order

ex parte, but thereafter refused to issue the interim injunction by order

dated 31.01.2020. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Homagama,

by judgment dated 21.06.2022, affirmed the order of the District Court. This

Court granted leave to appeal to the plaintiff on the following question of

law:

Did the High Court and the District Court err in law in not considering

that the defendant is not entitled to take any benefit from the premises

and such interim injunction prayed for by the plaintiff could be

granted?

The plaintiff, a body corporate, the Piliyandala Young Buddhist Association,

is the owner of the premises. The plaintiff leased the premises to the

defendant for a period of five years from 01.07.2012 to 30.06.2017, subject

to the terms and conditions set out in the lease agreement. As is evident

from the documents tendered with the plaint, when the said lease was about

to expire, the defendant wrote several letters to the plaintiff earnestly

requesting an extension of the lease period, citing various reasons,

including the indigent circumstances of his ailing parents, who had

previously been lessees under the plaintiff.

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

The plaintiff consistently refused to extend the lease on the basis that the

premises were required for the establishment of a public library for the

greater benefit of society. Notwithstanding this, the defendant persisted in

making fervent requests, and the plaintiff eventually agreed to grant a

further extension of 18 months, from 01.07.2017 to 31.12.2018, subject to

revised terms and conditions. One such condition was that the defendant

expressly agree in writing that he would not, under any circumstances, seek

a further extension of the lease beyond 31.12.2018. These conditions were

communicated to the defendant by letter marked C6.

All the new conditions were incorporated into the new lease agreement, in

agreement. The new lease agreement was notarially executed between the

plaintiff and the defendant on 19.08.2017. Clause 19 of the said lease

agreement reads as follows:

Several letters were sent to the defendant prior to the expiry of the extended

lease period, reminding him of his obligation to vacate the premises by

31.12.2018. However, the defendant regrettably failed and refused to vacate

the premises.

The plaintiff thereafter waited for a further period of one year in the

expectation that the defendant would hand over vacant possession. Upon

his continued failure to do so, the plaintiff instituted this action on

13.11.2019 and sought the aforesaid interim injunction pending the

determination of the action.

In the objections filed against the application for interim injunction, the

defendant, for the first time, took up a high-handed position by contending

that the premises are governed by the Rent Act and that, upon the expiry

of the lease, he became a statutory tenant and was therefore not obliged to

vacate the premises merely because the lease agreement had expired.

Both the District Court and the High Court correctly refrained from

adjudicating upon the validity of this defence at that stage and left it to be

determined at the conclusion of the trial.

In considering an application for interim injunction, the Court is not

required to finally determine the rights of the parties in the manner expected

at the end of the trial. What is expressed by a Court in an order granting or

refusing an interim injunction represents only its provisional views, formed

on the basis of the material then available, solely for the purpose of

determining the interlocutory application, and not its concluded views on

the merits of the case.

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

The law relating to interim injunctions in Sri Lanka is governed by statutory

provisions. The substantive law is found in section 54 of the Judicature Act,

while the procedural law is contained in sections 662 to 667 of Chapter

XLVIII of the Civil Procedure Code. Although an interim injunction is a

statutory remedy, the exercise of it by Courts is governed by well-

established equitable principles.

As was authoritatively laid down by Justice Soza in the celebrated decision

of Felix Dias Bandaranaike v. The State Film Corporation [1981] 2 Sri LR

287, the sequential tests to be applied in deciding whether or not an interim

injunction should be granted are as follows:

(a) Does the plaintiff have a strong prima facie case?

(b) Where does the balance of convenience lie?

(c) Do equitable considerations favour the plaintiff?

However, in Amarasekere v. Mitsui and Co. Ltd. [1993] 1 Sri LR 22 at 34,

Justice Amarasinghe quoted with approval the following observations of

Lord Denning M.R. in Hubbard v. Vosper [1972] 2 QB 84 at 96, which were

also quoted with approval by Sachs L.J. in Evans Marshall & Co. v. Bertola

S.A. [1973] 1 WLR 349 at 378:

In considering whether to grant an interlocutory injunction, the right

course for the judge is to look at the whole case. He must have regard

not only to the strength of the claim but also to the strength of the

defence, and then decide what is best to be done. Sometimes it is best

to grant an injunction so as to maintain the status quo until the trial. At

other times it is best not to impose a restraint upon the defendant but

to leave him free to go ahead. ... The remedy by interlocutory injunction

is so useful that it should be kept flexible and discretionary. It must not

be made the subject of strict rules.

I am in respectful agreement with the above view.

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

In the instant application, the learned District Judge did not consider

whether the plaintiff had established a prima facie winnable case and

whether equitable considerations favoured the plaintiff. I must state that,

prima facie, the plaintiff would succeed on both. However, the learned

District Judge proceeded directly to consider the balance of convenience

and concluded that it favoured the defendant.

The balance of convenience is assessed by considering whether the harm

likely to be suffered by the defendant if the injunction is granted would

outweigh the harm likely to be suffered by the plaintiff if it is refused. In

essence, which party would suffer greater harm?

In refusing to grant the interim injunction, the learned District Judge took

the view that no tangible benefit would accrue to the plaintiff by restraining

the defendant from carrying on the business in the premises, whereas the

grant of such an injunction would cause grave prejudice to the defendant

by depriving him of his livelihood. On that basis, the Judge declined to apply

the wrongdoer principle, which I shall address shortly, and refused to grant

the interim injunction.

The learned District Judge further stated that the plaintiff had not produced

evidence of practical steps taken to establish a public library in the

premises.

This approach is erroneous, particularly when viewed in light of the nature

of the interim injunction sought by the plaintiff. The learned District Judge’s

conclusion that no benefit would accrue to the plaintiff by restraining the

defendant from continuing the business is fundamentally inconsistent with

the rationale underlying the wrongdoer principle and also overlooks the

practical realities of litigation.

The plaintiff instituted this action in 2019, seeking the ejectment of the

defendant more than one year after the expiry of the lease. Yet, the

defendant continues to carry on his business and earn profits from the

premises as usual. It is a matter of common experience that such litigation

may continue for a considerable period of time, during which a defendant

in unlawful occupation has every incentive to prolong the proceedings so

long as he is permitted to continue the commercial use of the premises. This

is a practical reality that the Court cannot ignore.

The learned District Judge also faulted the plaintiff for not producing

evidence of practical steps taken to establish the proposed public library.

However, where the plaintiff is the owner of the property, it is not required

to justify the ejectment of a trespasser by demonstrating the purpose for

which he intends to use his own property. Possession is an essential

9

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

incident of ownership, and an owner is entitled to recover possession from

a person in unlawful occupation without being called upon to explain the

future use of the property.

The High Court endorsed the approach adopted by the District Court and

affirmed its conclusion. The High Court further held that no irreparable

damage would be caused to the plaintiff by the refusal of the interim

injunction sought.

Accordingly, in the event the Defendant is refrained from carrying out

business in the subject land by way of an interim injunction as claimed

by the Plaintiff, without giving him an opportunity to establish that the

subject premises is governed by the Rent Act, the damages caused to

the Defendant, is much higher than the damages caused to the

Plaintiff, by not granting interim injunction as prayed by the Plaintiff.

Hence, the Learned District Judge rightly held that the balance of

convenience lies in favour of the Defendant.

The considered view of this Court is irreparable loss or damage would

not be caused to the Plaintiff due to carrying out business by the

defendant in the subject property since in the event, the Defendant

would fail to establish his Defence, the Plaintiff is entitled to claim for

damages from the Defendant. In view of the materials placed by the

parties, it is observed that in the event, the Defendant is not refrained

from doing any business in the subject property pending the action the

Plaintiff would not cause irreparable or irremediable damages.

Considering all the material placed by the parties, we are of the view

that the learned District Judge has rightly refused to grant interim

injunction as prayed for by the plaintiff, restraining the defendant from

carrying on business in the subject matter of the action after the expiry

of lease agreement.

10

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

I am unable to accept this reasoning.

As the injunction is an equitable relief granted in the discretion of the Court,

the conduct and dealings of the parties and the circumstances of the case

are relevant.

It is in this backdrop that the wrongdoer principle has come to be applied

in applications for interim injunctions. It is evident that both the District

Court and the High Court failed to appreciate the distinctive nature of the

interim injunction sought by the plaintiff, which was expressly founded on

this principle. The plaintiff did not seek to eject the defendant pending the

determination of the action, but to restrain the defendant from carrying on

business and earning profits pending determination of the action. This

species of interim injunction is primarily grounded in the Latin maxim

nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria, which means “A

wrongdoer should not be allowed to benefit from his own wrongdoing.”

The law does not permit a party who has acted unlawfully, dishonestly, or

in breach of duty to found a claim, defence, or advantage upon the fruits of

his own wrongdoing. Accordingly, when considering an application for this

category of interim injunction, the Court should not refuse relief by applying

only the test of balance of convenience, for the injunction sought is founded

on a different and distinct legal rationale.

This legal doctrine serves several core purposes, foremost among them

being the preservation of the integrity of the judicial process. Courts must

not be seen to endorse or reward unlawful conduct, for permitting a

wrongdoer to benefit from his own wrongdoing would inevitably undermine

public confidence in the administration of justice. The doctrine also has a

deterrent purpose, as permitting legal advantage to flow from wrongdoing

would encourage non-compliance with the law. Finally, it promotes fairness

between parties, ensuring that a person is not placed in a better position by

11

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

reason of improper or unlawful conduct than he would have occupied had

he acted lawfully.

In Seelawathie Mallawa v. Millie Keerthiratne [1982] 1 Sri LR 384, the facts

of which bear a close resemblance to those of the present case, the lessee

refused to vacate the premises upon the effluxion of the lease and continued

to carry on his business therein, earning profits while remaining in unlawful

possession. Justice Victor Perera, speaking for the Supreme Court,

characterised such an overholding lessee as a trespasser and held that the

payment of damages for wrongful occupation, in the event the plaintiff

ultimately succeeds, would be an inadequate remedy. At page 389, His

Lordship expressly applied the wrongdoer principle to justify the grant of

an interim injunction restraining the defendant from deriving benefit from

his wrongful possession.

Much of the argument before us was based on the plea that the

plaintiff-respondent could be compensated by damages for the

wrongful possession of the land and buildings by the

defendant-appellant even though the plaintiff-respondent had made

out a strong prima facie case in regard to her claim. It was therefore

contended that the order issuing an interim injunction was not justified.

In the present case, the defendant-appellant being an over-holding

lessee is a trespasser in regard to the land and buildings leased to her

and will be liable to pay damages for wrongful possession thereof, but

there is the further fact that she was trying thereby to keep alive a

licence to run a business which licence had ceased to exist and to

derive for herself the sole benefit therefrom as long as the litigation

lasted.

An injunction is the normal way of stopping a wrongdoer from obtaining

the benefit of such wrong doing to the detriment of the aggrieved party.

12

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

It was further stated at pages 390–391 as follows:

On the authority of the case of Pounds v. Ganegama (40 NLR 73) the

District Judge could not possibly have placed the plaintiff-respondent

in possession of the leased premises pending the trial. The Supreme

Court in that case clearly held, that a Court by an interim injunction

had no power to remove a defendant in possession pending the result

of an action. The District Judge quite correctly refused to grant such an

injunction. However, the District Judge had addressed his mind to the

underlying principle that if a person in unlawful possession could not

be ejected pending trial, he could still be restrained from taking any

benefits arising out of such wrongful possession, otherwise the Court

would be a party to the preserving for the defendant-appellant a

position of advantage brought about by her own unlawful or wrongful

conduct.

A similar view was taken by Justice Tambiah in Subramanium v. Shabdeen

[1984] 1 Sri LR 48 at 56:

Prima facie, therefore, after the Agreement X2 expired on 4.6.82, the

defendant is in wrongful and unlawful possession of the business. It

will take a long time for the case to be finally disposed of. Is it just that

the plaintiff should be confined to his remedy in damages? I do not

think so. Until the case is finally disposed of, the defendant will be

wrongfully earning a large income from the business, while the

plaintiff, who has established prima facie his right to carry on the said

business, will be deprived of his right to earn the same income during

the same period. The learned Judge himself took the same view. There

is this further principle that an injunction would issue to stop a wrong

doer from obtaining benefits arising out of his wrongful conduct. If a

person in unlawful possession could not be ejected pending trial, he

could still be restrained from taking any benefits arising out of such

13

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

wrongful possession, otherwise the Court would be a party to the

preserving for such person a position of advantage brought about by

his own unlawful or wrongful conduct (Victor Perera, J. Seelawathie

Mallawa v. Millie Keerthiratne).

In Kariyawasam v. Sujatha Janaki [2013] 1 Sri LR 176, Justice Ekanayake,

speaking for the Supreme Court, quoted with approval the wrongdoer

principle enunciated in Seelawathie Mallawa and followed in Subramanium,

and concluded at page 191 as follows:

In the case at hand too when the defendants appear to be in wrongful

possession of the subject matter, they cannot be allowed to obtain the

benefits of their wrongdoings. The nature of the interim injunction

sought … is to restrain the defendants from obtaining any benefits from

their wrongdoings. Therefore the District Judge was correct in granting

the said injunction.

In all those cases, the Court granted interim injunctions by applying the

wrongdoer principle, thereby preventing the defendants from carrying on

business and earning profits pending the determination of the action.

The principle that the law will not permit a party to take advantage of his

own wrongdoing is well entrenched. Maxwell on The Interpretation of

Statutes, 12ᵗʰ Edition 1969, at page 212, states:

On the general principle of avoiding injustice and absurdity, any

construction will, if possible, be rejected (unless the policy of the Act

requires it) if it would enable a person by his own act to impair an

obligation which he has undertaken, or otherwise to profit by his own

wrong. “A man may not take advantage of his own wrong. He may not

plead in his own interest a self-created necessity.” (Kish v. Taylor

[1911] 1 KB 625, per Fletcher Moulton L.J. at page 634)

14

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

The principle that a wrongdoer should not be permitted to profit from his

own wrongdoing is deeply entrenched across common law jurisdictions.

In Attorney General v. Blake [2000] UKHL 45, [2001] 1 AC 268, the House

of Lords observed that “The broad proposition that a wrongdoer should not

be allowed to profit from his wrong has an obvious attraction. The corollary

is that the person wronged may recover the amount of this profit when he has

suffered no financially measurable loss.” The same principle was reaffirmed

by the House of Lords in Moore Stephens (a firm) (Respondents) v. Stone Rolls

Limited (in liquidation) (Appellants) [2009] UKHL 39.

South African courts have consistently applied the same principle. In MEC

for the Department of Health, KwaZulu-Natal v. Shaw and Others [2009]

ZAKZPHC 77, Madondo J. stated that “the wrongdoers cannot be allowed to

benefit out of their own wrongdoing or mistake.” Similarly, in L’Oreal South

Africa (Pty) Ltd v. Kilpatrick and Another [2014] ZALCJHB 353, Snyman A.J.

affirmed that “As a matter of principle, no man can be allowed to profit from

his own wrongdoing, especially in a situation of an agreement that has

material reciprocal obligations.” In Air Innovations (Pty) Ltd v. Pillay [2017]

ZAGPJHC 444, the High Court of South Africa reiterated that the law does

not permit a person to make money from conduct that is unlawful.

The Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa, in Food & Allied Workers

Union v. Ngcobo NO and Another [2013] ZASCA 45, quoted with approval the

view expressed by P.M. Nienaber, a distinguished South African jurist and

former Judge of that Court, in The Effect of Anticipatory Repudiation:

Principle and Policy, (1962) Cambridge Law Journal 213 at 225, where he

stated:

It is a fundamental principle of our law that no man can take advantage

of his own wrong. Nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua

propria. From this broad proposition it follows that a contracting party

15

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

cannot liberate himself from a contract by reason of his own breach. A

contract mutually made cannot be terminated unilaterally, unless the

law authorises the one to do so by reason of the other’s misconduct.

Rescission cannot be effected at the instance of the guilty party. Hence

the innocent party to a breach of contract, entitled to rescind, is not

obliged to do so.

In Higgins v. Orion Insurance Co. Ltd. et al., 1985 CanLII 2011 (ON CA),

Robins J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal, after surveying a number of

authorities, observed that “underlying these cases is the age-old tenet that a

wrongdoer must not be allowed to take advantage, directly or indirectly, of

his or her own wrong.”

In Richard Shorten & Anor v. David Hurst Constructions Pty Limited & Anor;

David Hurst Constructions v. Richard William Shorten & Anor [2008] NSWSC

546, Einstein J., sitting in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, stated:

66. In considering the type and weight of evidence required to satisfy

the Court on this issue, the court is entitled to further rely upon the

maxim ‘nullus commodum capere potest de injuria sua propria’: “No

man can take advantage of his own wrong”: cf ADC v White (1999)

NSWSC 43 at 89 et seq. This principle is supported by a long line of

authority [cf Broome’s Legal Maxims, 10th edition, Pakistan Law House,

1989 at 191 et seq, noting that this maxim, being ‘based on elementary

principles’, is fully recognised in Courts of law and equity and, indeed,

admits of illustration from every branch of legal procedure].

67. The principle and its application to several areas of law has

relatively recently been discussed in the House of Lords by Lord

Jauncey in Alghussein Establishment v. Eton College [1988] 1 WLR

587, with whose reasons Lord Bridge, Lord Elwin Jones, Lord Ackner

and Lord Goff agreed.

16

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

68. The principle is applicable to “various and dissimilar

circumstances” [per Broome at page 195].

Indian jurisprudence is equally settled. In Ashok Kapil v. Sana Ullah and

Others [1996] 6 SCC 342, the Supreme Court of India held:

If the crucial date is the date of allotment order, the structure was not

a building as defined in the Act. But can the respondent be assisted by

a court of law to take advantage of the mischief committed by him? The

maxim “Nullus commodum copere potest de injuria sua propria” (No

man can take advantage of his own wrong) is one of the salient tenets

of equity. Hence, in the normal course, respondent cannot secure the

assistance of a court of law for enjoying the fruit of his own wrong.

In Eureka Forbes Ltd v. Allahabad Bank (2010) 6 SCC 193, the Indian

Supreme Court emphasised that “The maxim nullus commodum capere

potest de injuria sua propria has a clear mandate of law that, a person who

by manipulation of a process frustrates the legal rights of others, should not

be permitted to take advantage of his wrong or manipulations.”

Taken together, these authorities demonstrate a consistent and unwavering

judicial response across jurisdictions: courts will not countenance attempts

by a party to secure a benefit flowing from his own wrongful acts. This

principle should apply with greater force where interim injunctions, which

are essentially moulded by equitable principles are sought, for equity will

not assist a wrongdoer to perpetuate or profit from wrongful conduct

pending adjudication of the main action on the merits.

In the instant case, the defendant is, prima facie, in wrongful possession of

the leased premises and has continued to carry on business therein and

earn profits for more than seven years after the expiry of the lease

agreement. In paragraph 15 of the statement of objections filed before the

District Court, the defendant has stated that they earn a net profit of Rs.

17

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

4,000 per day. Applying the wrongdoer principle, the defendant cannot be

permitted to benefit from his own wrongdoing pending the determination of

the action.

The District Court acknowledged the wrongdoer principle as enunciated by

the superior courts of this country, but declined to apply it on the basis that

no prejudice would be caused to the plaintiff by the refusal of the interim

injunction. The High Court did not consider the application of the

wrongdoer principle at all.

The finding of the High Court that no irreparable damage would be caused

to the plaintiff, on the footing that the plaintiff could recover damages in the

event of ultimate success, cannot be accepted as good law. I acknowledge

that the traditional view has been that where damages are quantifiable, an

injunction will not ordinarily lie. However, this proposition was specifically

examined and qualified in Seelawathie Mallawa, in the context of the

application of the wrongdoer principle, and a contrary conclusion was

reached.

Further, Justice Amerasinghe, in Amarasekere v. Mitsui and Company Ltd.

[1993] 1 Sri LR 22 at 37, questioned the continuing validity of this

traditional approach in the contemporary legal context, observing as

follows:

I should like to refer to the following observations of Sachs, LJ. in Evans

Marshall & Co. v. Bertola SA (supra) at p. 379 para. H-p. 380 para. H:

The standard question in relation to the grant of an injunction, “Are

damages an adequate remedy?”, might perhaps, in the light of the

authorities of recent years, be rewritten: “Is it just, in all the

circumstances, that a plaintiff should be confined to his remedy in

damages? …. The courts have repeatedly recognized that there can be

claims under contracts in which, as here, it is unjust to confine a

18

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

plaintiff to his damages for their breach .... So far the question of

adequacy of damages has been discussed on the footing that if

judgment was recovered (sic) the sum awarded would be paid. But

whenever the adequacy of damages falls to be considered in this class

of case, there arises the further question are the defendants good for

the money? Also (if they are abroad), will their government’s exchange

control permit the payment? In other words, will the judgment be

satisfied?

In Sumeet Research and Holdings Ltd. v. Elite Radio & Engineering Co. Ltd.

[1997] 2 Sri LR 393 at 408, the Court of Appeal held that “once loss is

quantified, the need for an enjoining order restraining the defendant does not

arise.” However, Justice Mark Fernando, in the Supreme Court, declined to

accept that proposition and observed as follows:

But the plaintiff did not attempt to quantify its future loss (as in the

precedents cited on behalf of the defendant). In any event, a claim for

damages is not an inflexible bar to the grant of injunctive relief, and I

would respectfully adopt the observations of Amerasinghe, J. in

Amerasekera v. Mitsui & Co. Ltd., the question is whether it is unjust,

in all the circumstances, to confine a plaintiff to damages for the breach

of contract.

It would be unjust to confine a plaintiff to damages and refuse injunction

on the ground that damages are quantifiable. Even after a protracted

litigation, a plaintiff who ultimately succeeds may be left with no more than

a paper decree if the defendant lacks assets. Even where assets exist, there

is a material distinction between entering a decree and its effective

enforcement. Moreover, there may be cases in which an award of damages,

however substantial, does not adequately compensate the injured party. By

way of illustration, the injury suffered by a plaintiff may have wider

ramifications, including adverse effects on business goodwill, reputation,

19

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

and future commercial opportunities. In a case such as the present, the

injury lies not merely in the loss of rent or use, but in being compelled to

tolerate the continued profit-making activities of a party who has no

entitlement to remain in occupation. The law cannot require an owner to

stand by while a wrongdoer continues to derive benefit, especially financial

benefit, from unlawful possession. For these reasons, an interim injunction

should not be refused solely on the basis that damages are quantifiable.

The question whether final relief may, in appropriate circumstances, be

granted by way of an interim injunction has been addressed in the orders

of both the District Court and the High Court. This is also a recurring issue.

The widely held view that final relief can never be granted by way of interim

relief is unsustainable in law. Where a plaintiff establishes a strong prima

facie case, and the balance of convenience and equitable considerations

favour him, it would be unjust to refuse interim injunction merely on the

ground that such relief may substantially coincide with the final relief

sought. In Shell Gas Lanka Ltd. v. Samyang Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. [2005] 3 Sri

LR 14, Justice Wimalachandra held that where there is a strong prima facie

case in favour of the plaintiff, the balance of convenience also favours him,

and no plausible defence is available to the defendant, it is not contrary to

law to grant an interim injunction even if such injunction affords the

plaintiff the substantial relief claimed by him. This principle was

subsequently cited with approval by the Supreme Court in People’s Bank v.

Yasasiri Kasthuriarachchi [2010] 1 Sri LR 227. I am in respectful agreement

with that view.

For the aforesaid reasons, I answer the question of law on which leave to

appeal was granted in the affirmative. I direct the learned District Judge to

issue forthwith the interim injunction as prayed for in paragraph (b) of the

prayer to the plaint dated 13.11.2019, restraining the defendant and all

20

SC/APPEAL/96/2025

persons holding under him from carrying on business in the premises or

deriving any benefit therefrom until the final determination of the action.

The learned District Judge is further directed to conclude the trial within a

period of six months from the date of receipt of this judgment.

In the unique facts and circumstances of this case, the defendant’s conduct

is reprehensible. The defendant shall pay a sum of Rupees One Million as

costs of all three Courts in relation to the proceedings concerning the

interim injunction, which have remained pending more than six years,

within one month from today.
