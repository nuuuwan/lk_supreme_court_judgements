The Court granted Leave to Appeal from the judgement dated 17.12.2021 of the Court of

Appeal, upon the following Questions of Law:

a. “Have their Lordships of the Court of Appeal grievously misdirected

themselves in law when they failed to hold that the sale of trees in terms of the

Sale Agreements are sales of unprocessed agricultural product and

consequently fall outside the scope of the Value Added Tax Act and not liable

for the Payment of Value Added Tax?".

m. “Did Their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in law when they failed to

appreciate that old rubber trees cannot come under the provision of agricultural

Page 3 of 10

'products' within the meaning of item (b) (xxiii) of Part II of the First Schedule

of the Value Added Tax Act”

The Appellant-Appellant (“Appellant”) entered into two agreements dated 02.07.2008

(‘X1’) and 21.05.2009 (‘X2’). The Appellant identifies the agreement marked ‘X1’ as an

agreement for the sale of standing live Rubber trees, while the second agreement (‘X’) is

an agreement for the sale of standing live Eucalyptus trees, on its plantation. The

Appellant claims exemption from Value Added Tax (‘VAT’) obligations for the timeframe

spanning 01.01.2009, through 31.12.2010, encompassing 24 monthly taxable periods

pursuant to Section 8 of the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 (‘Act’).

In terms of Section 8 of the said Act, no tax is imposed on the supply of goods or services,

or on the importation of goods outlined in the First Schedule to the Act, since these

transactions are exempted from taxation except where they qualify as zero-rated under

Section 7. In particular, Part II (b) (xxiii) of the First Schedule provides an exemption from

VAT for unprocessed agricultural, horticultural, or fishing products produced in Sri

Lanka. This exemption extends to local supplies of such unprocessed products for which

no VAT has been levied or remitted to the Department of Inland Revenue on or after

01.07.2007.

The primary argument of the Appellant is that the sale of standing live Rubber and

Eucalyptus trees intended for cutting, uprooting and removal by the buyer, in terms of the

referenced Agreements, qualifies for VAT exemption, classifying it as a local supply of

‘unprocessed agricultural product’. For a person to be liable to VAT, there should be a

taxable supply in respect of a taxable activity of that person in Sri Lanka. The taxable

supply1 and the taxable activity2 are defined in Section 83 of the Act. Referring to Clause

1 'taxable supply' means any supply of goods or services made or deemed to be made in Sri Lanka which is chargeable with tax under this Act and includes a supply charged at the rate of zero percent other than an exempt supply.

2 taxable activity' means- (a) any activity carried on as a business, trade, profession or vocation other than in the course of employment or every adventure or concern in the nature of a trade (b) the provision of facilities to its members or others for a consideration and the payment of subscription in the case of a club, association or organisation; (c) anything done in connection with the commencement or cessation of any activity or provision of facility referred to in (a) or (b);

10.5.1 of the classification for exemptions in the Guide to Value Added Tax issued by the

Department of Inland Revenue on 06.09.2002, the Appellant asserts that the local supply

of the standing live Rubber and Eucalyptus Trees under those agreements unequivocally

constitutes a supply of ‘unprocessed agricultural products’, thereby rendering it exempt

from VAT.

The said Clause 10.5.1 reads:

“10.5 Following clarifications may be noted with regard to exemptions provided in the first

schedule.

10.5.1 Unprocessed Agricultural Produce – item (i)(a)

• Live trees, and other plants, roots, branches, leaves, flowers, tubes, seeds, fruits

and nuts of trees and other plants in natural form not otherwise processed.

• Coconut shells and pairings can be considered as unprocessed for the purpose of

exemption but charcoal is not.

• Vegetables, lac, gums, resins and other vegetable saps and extracts.

• Straws, husks, shells, skins of trees and other plants in raw form not chemically

treated or otherwise processed; other than plants in natural form.

• Any kind of semi processed rubber.”

The Respondent-Respondent who is the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(‘Respondent’), affirmed the decision of the Assessor who rejected the claim for exemption

from VAT. The appeal lodged by the Appellant to the Tax Appeals Commission (‘TAC’)

was also dismissed. As a result of an application made by the Appellant, the TAC

submitted 17 questions for determination by the Court of Appeal, which delivered its

judgement on 17.12.2021. The Court of Appeal held, inter alia, that “while the TAC

overlooked the fact that the items sold were live trees, these trees nevertheless did not

(d) the hiring or leasing of any movable property or the renting or leasing of immovable property or the administration of any property; (e) the exploitation of any intangible property such as patents, copyrights or other similar assets where such asset is registered in Sri Lanka or the owner of such asset is domiciled in Sri Lanka.

qualify as ‘unprocessed agricultural products’; consequently, though the TAC erred in fact,

it did not err in law in determining eligibility for the exemption.”

The Respondent relies on the judgement of the Court of Appeal in Kegalle Plantations PLC

v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue CA/TAX/09/2017 decided on 04.09.2018, in

which the substance test3 was used to determine the true nature of the contracts,

particularly whether a contract is a ‘contract for the sale of goods’ or ‘contract for the

supply of services’. The contention of the Respondent is that the ‘processing’ referred to in

the Act and the Guide to VAT entails rendering items suitable for retail. In this view, the

transaction concerns the sale of felled trees, which constitute the end product received by

the buyer. Accordingly, the Respondent asserts that the Appellant's Rubber and

Eucalyptus Trees qualify as "processed," thereby disqualifying them from VAT

exemption.

The appellants in the said Kegalle Plantations PLC case had executed multiple contracts

for uprooting and removal of rubber trees. They had claimed exemption from VAT on the

basis that such contracts effectively amounted to sales of live Rubber trees in a natural

form. His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva, in the Court of Appeal (as His Lordship was

then), took the view that, the trees sold have ceased to be productive in their natural form,

as the Appellant had called for tenders to uproot and remove non-harvesting rubber trees.

The Court of Appeal, examining Section 4(1) of the Act as a deeming provision to

determine the time of supply for the purposes of Section 2(1), observed that VAT is

charged at the time of supply, thereby necessitating a clear identification of when the

taxable supply of goods or services takes place. Ultimately, the court held that the deeming

effect therein is restricted to ascertaining the time of supply for the purpose of charging

VAT.

The court in the said Kegalle Plantations PLC case concluding that there has been a "taxable

supply of goods" by the Appellant in terms of the VAT Act in relation to rubber trees under

the aforesaid agreements, decided inter alia:

3 per Greer L.J. in Robinson v. Graves [(1935) 1 KB 579 at 587; Atiyah, Adams and Macqueen, The Sale of Goods (11th Ed.; page 27)

Page 6 of 10

“It cannot be used to establish that the supply of goods did in fact take place at that

point of time. In terms of section 83 of the VAT Act "supply of goods" means the

passing of exclusive ownership of goods to another as the owner of such goods.

Hence for there to be a "supply of goods" there must be a passing of "exclusive

ownership of goods". That in our view must be ascertained upon a consideration

of the provisions in the Sale of Goods Ordinance dealing with the passing of

property.”

“However, as long as the trees are in situ on land owned by the State property in

them cannot be transferred to the contractor. The property in them can be

transferred only after uprooting them. In those circumstances, the true nature of

the contracts in substance is that they are for the uprooting and removal of trees for

the supply of rubber logs. The consideration for these contracts was the timber

value of the trees uprooted, removed and taken into the possession of the

contractor.”

“The subject matter of the contracts between the Appellant and his contractors are

not in our view live trees. The true nature of the contracts in substance is that they

are for the uprooting and removal of trees for the supply of rubber logs. The

consideration for these contracts was the timber value of the trees uprooted,

removed and taken into the possession of the contractor. The exemption from VAT

given to "unprocessed agricultural product" does not cover the instant case where

non-harvesting rubber trees are uprooted and removed. That involves a process

which changes the subject from a rubber tree to firewood, logs and chips. The

Appellant in the Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March

2008 identify the profits of these transactions as "Sales of firewood, logs and chips".

Accordingly, the subject matter of the contracts between the Appellant and its

contractors are not live trees within the meaning of the Guide to the Value Added

Tax in Sri Lanka. It is also not "unprocessed agricultural product" within the

meaning of item (b) (xxiii) of Part II of the First Schedule of the VAT Act”.

Before the TAC, the Appellant contended that the trees remained unprocessed at the point

of supply, which arises upon the making of payment, rendering such supply exempt from

VAT liability. Furthermore, the Appellant asserted that the Assessor failed to conduct

Page 7 of 10

assessments for each distinct monthly period as mandated by Section 28 of the Act, thereby

invalidating the pertinent assessments. The Appellant additionally emphasized that it

disposed of the live trees through a tender process, with the successful bidder remitting the

entire purchase price while the trees were still in their live form; consequently, these live

trees qualify as unprocessed agricultural products, constituting an exempt supply under

the VAT Act.

Nevertheless, the TAC observed that, in the absence of simultaneous conveyance of both

‘title’ and ‘possession,’ the contractor (i.e., the ‘buyer’) would gain no benefit from the

upfront payment remitted. It was further highlighted that, owing to the trees' fixed position

on Government-owned property, the mere supply of these live trees could not effectuate a

transfer of either title or possession to the contractor. Moreover, the TAC determined that:

“The Contractor has not got anything for the consideration paid by him. He

couldn't get anything from live trees. However, it is a fact that the Contractor makes

a payment to the Appellant Company under the said Agreement. In view of the

substance of the ‘Agreement for uprooting and removal of the trees’, he makes this

payment in expectation of a future supply, i.e. supply of timber logs, but not for the

supply of live trees. Live rubber trees on the land of the Appellant Company could

be supplied only for tapping them for latex, on a lease, and for nothing else. Such

a lease agreement is a supply of service agreement.”

In classifying the relevant agreements, the TAC concluded that it constituted a contract

for the uprooting and removal of old Rubber trees, rather than for the supply of live Rubber

trees. Accordingly, it was ruled that taking possession of ‘goods’ was a prerequisite for

securing absolute ownership of those goods, i.e., timber, to gain the expected advantages

therefrom. The TAC further held that the contractor ultimately received, via the supply,

rubber logs or timber as movable property, and that the Appellant, in return for the total

remuneration obtained, supplied the contractor with such rubber logs or timber pursuant

to the Agreements.

Taking into consideration the arguments advanced by both the Appellant and the

Respondent, I’m unable to deviate from the rationale articulated in the Kegalle Plantations

PLC case, as I cannot find any cogent statutory underpinning or authoritative precedent

to do so. I hold that the reasons given in the said Kegalle Plantations PLC case, analysing

Page 8 of 10

the true effect of Sections 4(1), 2(1) and 83 of the Act, should be followed in the Case in

hand.

Similarly, I must draw my attention to the assertions made on behalf of the Appellant at

certain stages of its appeal process, pointing out that the Court’s reliance on the Sale of

Goods Ordinance was improperly applied. Section 18 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance

reads:

“18(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific or ascertained goods,

the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to

the contract intend it to be transferred.

18(2) For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties, regard shall

be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties, and the

circumstances of the case.”

As per the above provisions, the property in contracts selling specific or ascertained goods

transfers to the buyer at the time the parties intend and such intent is ascertained from the

contract terms, parties' conduct, and circumstances of the case. In terms of Section 59 of

the Sale of Goods Ordinance, the phrase "specific goods" is interpreted as ‘goods identified

and agreed upon at the time a contract of sale is made’. Anyhow, the term ‘ascertained

goods’ is not specifically defined. Thus, one may argue that under the Agreements relevant

to the instant Case, the Rubber trees designated for uprooting were marked with

consecutive numbers by the estate (per the tree uprooting schedule), rendering the contract

goods as ascertained, thereby the transfer of ownership takes place at the time of executing

the Agreement and not at the logs stage of the process.

Anyhow, according to the special circumstances of this Case, I take the view that those

Trees, as per the terms of the relevant Agreements, should be considered as unascertained

goods at the time of executing the Agreements, merely because the goods to be delivered

to the buyer become unequivocally identifiable according to law only at a later stage than

the time of execution of the Agreements, upon full uprooting and separation from the

remaining trees. In this regard, Sections 4(1) and 83 of the VAT Act should be read

together with Section 18 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance. In addition to other relevant

Page 9 of 10

provisions, I particularly note Clause 3.2 of the Agreement4 (for Rubber Trees) at page 32

of the brief and Clause 3.2 of the Agreement5 (for Eucalyptus Trees) at page 27. Hence, no

property is passed until the portions to be sold are segregated from the remainder of the

bulk, which occurs only after the Agreements are concluded. Even the Court in the said

Kegalle Plantations PLC case determined that the goods forming the subject matter of the

contracts in the said case were not specific or ascertained goods.

The Supreme Court in Perera & Silva Ltd., v Commissioner-General Of Inland Revenue

[1978] Vol 79 Part II NLR 164, referred to Elements of the Law of Income and Capital Gains

Taxation by C. N. Beatie (at page 2), where it has been stated that there is no equity in a

taxing statute and if there is a doubt in the language of the statute whether tax is attracted

or not, the doubt must be resolved in favour of the taxpayer. The five judge bench of the

Supreme Court of India in Commissioner of Customs (import), Mumbai v. M/s Dilip Kumar

and Company and others [2018] 9 SCC 1, decided that where there is an ambiguity in an

exemption notification which is subject to strict interpretation, the benefit of such

ambiguity cannot be claimed by the subject/assessee and that it must be interpreted in

favour of the revenue.

Notably, the instant case stems from a tax exemption provision. In line with the

articulations in the above judicial pronouncements, I take the view that the established

principle should be that in cases of ambiguity regarding whether a tax levy applies, the

doubt must be resolved in the taxpayer's favour, protecting against unwarranted fiscal

impositions, as taxing statutes admit no principles of equity. Likewise, ambiguities in

exemption clauses which warrant strict interpretation afford no benefit to the assessee but

must instead be resolved in favour of the revenue, ensuring exemptions are not expansively

construed in a manner that erodes the state's authority to impose taxation. In any event, if

ambiguity arises under either of the above conditions, the interpretation must also be

guided by other established principles governing the interpretation of statutes.

4 3.2: Each tree shall be uprooted by exposing the tap root and the lateral roots. The root stump, if any

remaining shall also be removed and the field completely cleared of all trees, timber, logs, roots and other debris. 5 3.2: The Purchaser shall all times abide by the instructions and or instructions of the Superintendent or his

authorized agent in connection with the carrying out of the felling of trees and removal thereof herein contemplated.

In light of the foregoing, I answer the above Questions of Law upon which this Court

granted Special Leave to Appeal in the Negative. Anyhow, due to the manner in which

the above second Question of Law has been formulated by the Appellant, I need to

emphasize that the Rubber trees covered by the Agreement at page 32 of the brief, do not

qualify as ‘agricultural products’ within the ambit of Part II (b) (xxiii) of the First Schedule

of the Act, thus are not exempt from VAT. For completeness, I must stress that this

Judgement addresses only those two Questions of Law. Therefore, I am compelled to

affirm the impugned judgment of the Court of Appeal, regardless of how it resolved the

questions of law formulated by the TAC as the Court of Appeal has not erred in law in

determining upon the tax exemption under Part II (b) (xxiii) of the First Schedule of the

Act, in relation to the goods subjected to the Agreements in the instant Case.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. I order no costs.
