COUNSEL: W. Dayaratne, PC with Ms. R. Jayawardena for the Added Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant. Shyamal A. Collure with Prabath S. Amarasinghe and A.P. Jayaweera for the 2nd and 3rd Defendants-Appellant-Respondents WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS: By the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant on 23.08.2024. By the Defendant-Appellant-Respondent on 30.07.2024.

ARGUED ON: 01.07.2024 DECIDED ON: 03.02.2026 K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J. This is an appeal from a judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court of

Kurunegala, case bearing No. 173/2010 F, dated 15.12.2015 which set

aside the judgment of the District Court of Chilaw, case bearing No:

24257/L dated 20.09.2010.

This Court, by Order dated 14.12.2016, granted Leave to Appeal on the

questions of law stated in paragraph 24(b), (c), (d), (f) and (h) of the Petition.

5

However, at the hearing of the appeal, both Counsel confined their

submissions to three questions of law, which are as follows:–

1. Have their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court failed to

consider that the Plaintiff- Respondent- Appellant proved title and

identity of the corpus?

2. Have their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court misdirected

themselves both in facts and law by holding that the judgment of the

Learned District Court Judge is untenable and devoid of facts?

3. Did their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court err in law in

arriving at the finding by disregarding onus of proof as set out in

section 101 and 103 of the Evidence Ordinance?

Factual Matrix

The Added Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was added to this case which was initially instituted by the

deceased original Plaintiff before the District Court of Chilaw against the

Defendants-Appellants-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondents). The Appellant stated that he was added as a party following

a petition dated 04.11.1995, as he had purchased the subject land from

the Original Plaintiff on 07.07.1995 under Deed No. 2094.

The Appellant stated that the Original Plaintiff had sought a declaration of

title to two allotments of land called "Welendakulam Kele." He stated that

the lands were respectively in extent of 3 acres and 1 acre and 2 roods, as

shown in Plans No. 877 and 1194 prepared by Vernon Perera, Licensed

Surveyor and were more fully described in the schedules to the plaint.

6

The Appellant stated that the original Plaintiff disclosed the devolution of

title in the amended plaint. He stated that Nanayakkara Pattambiralalage

Don Joseph Aloysius, Kalugamage Mosiyas Fernando, K. Peduru

Fernando and K. Francis Fernando became entitled to the land called

"Welendakulam Kele" under Deed No. 36670 dated 27.08.1952.

The Appellant stated that portions of the land were subsequently

transferred. He stated that a portion measuring 3 acres was transferred to

K. Manual Joseph Anthony Fernando under Deed No. 1372 dated

16.12.1957 and another portion measuring 1 acre and 2 roods was

transferred to the same person under Plan No. 871 dated 02.08.1955.

The Appellant stated that K. Manual Joseph Anthony Fernando

subsequently transferred the lands to K. Dona Catherine Perera under

Deed No. 1395 dated 10.03.1958. He stated that K. Dona Catherine Perera

later transferred the lands back to K. Joseph Anthony Manual Fernando

under Deed No. 94 dated 28.05.1964. Thereafter, K. Joseph Anthony

Manual Fernando transferred the lands to the original Plaintiff under Deed

No. 1547 dated 07.08.1964.

The Appellant stated that after acquiring the lands, the original Plaintiff

entered into possession and began extracting clay for the manufacture of

tiles. He stated that through such possession, the Original Plaintiff

acquired prescriptive title over the lands.

The Appellant stated that the 1st Defendant unlawfully entered the lands

in or about 1994 and subsequently transferred them to the 2nd to 4th

Respondents under Deed No. 12 dated 06.05.1994. He stated that a

complaint was lodged with the Chilaw Police regarding the unlawful

possession and proceedings were initiated in the Primary Court.

7

The Appellant stated that the Respondents denied the original Plaintiff’s

claims and sought to declare themselves owners of the lands. He stated

that the Respondents claimed to have acquired prescriptive title by

uninterrupted possession for over ten years.

The Appellant stated that the case proceeded to trial on twenty issues, with

issues 1 to 14 raised on behalf of the original Plaintiff and issues 15 to 20

raised on behalf of the Respondents. He stated that during the trial, the

original Plaintiff testified that he had been excavating clay from the land

for twenty years until 1991. He further stated that the 1st Defendant

resided on an adjoining land measuring 1½ acres.

The Appellant stated that the original Plaintiff admitted that he had sold

the land to the Appellant, who was subsequently added as a party to the

case. He stated that a witness, Kuruvitage Don Rathnasekera, testified

that he had transported clay from the original Plaintiff’s land to Kalyana

Tile Mill for about ten years since 1965.

The Appellant stated that the 3rd Defendant testified that the 1st

Defendant was her father and had cultivated paddy and coconut on the

land. She stated that her father had transferred the land to her and to the

2nd and 4th Respondents under Deed No. 12.

The Appellant stated that a Grama Niladhari, Gunaherath Chandrasekera

Sugath Chandrasekera, testified that the 1st Defendant had been in

possession of the land from 1990 to 1994. He stated that a Divisional

Secretary, Nelumdeniya Pathirennehelage Kularatne Nelumdeniya,

testified that at the time of his inspection, the land had no fence or coconut

cultivation and holes for clay excavation were visible.

8

The Appellant stated that after the conclusion of the trial, the Learned

Additional District Judge delivered judgment on 20.09.2010 in favor of the

original Plaintiff. He stated that the District Court found that the Original

Plaintiff had proved title on the balance of probabilities and that the

Respondents had failed to establish prescriptive title.

The Appellant stated that the 1st to 4th Respondents appealed to the Civil

Appellate High Court of the North Western Province. He stated that on

16.12.2015, the High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the District

Court judgment.

The Appellant stated that the Civil Appellate High Court erred in law by

holding that the original Plaintiff failed to establish title and that the lands

were not identified. He stated that the original Plaintiff had produced

uncontested documents proving devolution of title and possession with

definite metes and bounds.

The Appellant stated that the Civil Appellate High Court failed to consider

that the Respondents had not proved adverse possession. He stated that

the High Court misdirected itself by disregarding procedural law, the

concept of onus of proof and the law relating to prescriptive possession.

The Respondents in this case were the 1st to 4th Defendants in the District

Court of Chilaw. The 1st Defendant was the father of the 3rd Defendant

and had been in possession of the land called “Velandikulam Kele” since

1951. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants were the children and successors-

in-title of the 1st Defendant. The 3rd Defendant resided on the land until

her marriage. The 2nd and 4th Defendants were siblings of the 3rd

Defendant. The Respondents claimed ownership of the land by virtue of

9

long and uninterrupted possession and through transfers from the 1st

Defendant.

The Respondents stated that the original Plaintiff instituted action in the

District Court of Chilaw on 09.05.1995 against the 1st to 4th Defendants

seeking a declaration of title to two allotments of land called “Velandikulam

Kele”, described in the First and Second Schedules to the plaint, together

with damages, costs and other relief. The Respondents stated that,

according to the schedules, the said allotments were depicted in Plans Nos.

1194 and 971 prepared by Vernon Perera, Licensed Surveyor and were

alleged to be in extents of 3 acres and 1 acre and 2 roods respectively.

The Respondents stated that by petition dated 04.11.1995 and affidavit

dated 29.11.1995, the original Plaintiff sought leave to add the present

Appellant as a party on the basis that the original Plaintiff had conveyed

the alleged rights to the land by Deed No. 2094 dated 07.07.1995. The

Respondents stated that the District Court allowed the said application on

20.05.1996 and added the Appellant as the 2nd Plaintiff.

The Respondents stated that by an undated amended plaint, the original

Plaintiff and the Added Plaintiff sought ejectment of the Defendants from

the lands described in the schedules in addition to the reliefs originally

prayed for.

Further the Respondents stated that in the answer dated 17.03.1997, the

1st Defendant pleaded long, uninterrupted and adverse possession of the

land known as “Velandikulam Kele”. The Respondents stated that the 1st

Defendant claimed to have acquired prescriptive title to the land. The

Respondents stated that the 1st Defendant had conveyed ownership of the

land to the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Defendants by Deed No. 12 dated 06.05.1994.

10

The Respondents stated that the Defendants prayed for the dismissal of

the Plaintiffs’ action and for a declaration that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th

Defendants were the lawful owners of the land.

The Respondents stated that when the case was taken up for trial on

08.06.1998, fourteen issues were framed on behalf of the Plaintiffs and six

issues were framed on behalf of the Defendants.

The Respondents stated that the Plaintiffs closed the case on 20.10.2004.

The Respondents stated that evidence was led by the original Plaintiff and

by Kuruvitage Don Rathnasekera. The Respondents stated that

documents marked P1 to P8 were produced in evidence.

The Respondents stated that the original Plaintiff testified that the original

Plaintiff purchased the land in 1964. The Respondents stated that the

original Plaintiff testified that clay was extracted from an area of about one

acre of the land until about 1990. The Respondents stated that the original

Plaintiff admitted that, from about 1975 onwards, the original Plaintiff

merely inspected the land from time to time. The Respondents stated that

the original Plaintiff admitted that the land was sold to the Added Plaintiff.

The Respondents stated that no independent evidence of possession was

led by the Plaintiffs for the period from 1975 to 1993.

The Respondents stated that Kuruvitage Don Rathnasekera testified that

clay was transported from the land said to belong to the original Plaintiff

to tile mills between 1965 and 1975. The Respondents stated that

Kuruvitage Don Rathnasekera testified that payment for the clay was

made to Wimalatissa, who was stated to have supervised the land.

The Respondents stated that evidence on behalf of the Defendants was led

by the 3rd Defendant, Gunaherath Chandrasekera Sugath

11

Chandrasekera, who served as Grama Niladhari and Nelumdeniya

Pathirannehelage Kularatne Nelumdeniya, who served as Divisional

Secretary of Arachchikattuwa in 1993.

The Respondents stated that the 3rd Defendant testified that the deceased

1st Defendant was the father of the 3rd Defendant. The Respondents

stated that the 3rd Defendant testified that the land was about 6½ acres

in extent. The Respondents stated that the 3rd Defendant testified that the

deceased 1st Defendant resided on the land, cultivated paddy and

coconut, extracted clay and enjoyed the produce of the land for more than

30 years. The Respondents stated that the 3rd Defendant testified that the

original Plaintiff never entered the land during the period of residence of

the 3rd Defendant. The Respondents stated that the 3rd Defendant

testified that portions of the land were sold on three occasions and that

the remaining extent thereafter was about 4½ acres.

The Respondents stated that Gunaherath Chandrasekera Sugath

Chandrasekera testified that service as Grama Niladhari of Kusala Grama

Sevaka Division No. 583 was from late 1990 to 1994. The Respondents

stated that Gunaherath Chandrasekera Sugath Chandrasekera testified

that during that period the 1st Defendant was in possession of the land

known as “Velandikulam Kele”, which was about 6 acres in extent. The

Respondents stated that the 1st Defendant resided in a small thatched

house on the land.

The Respondents stated that Nelumdeniya Pathirannehelage Kularatne

Nelumdeniya testified that an inspection of the land was carried out on

22.10.1993 pursuant to a complaint made by the 1st Defendant. The

Respondents stated that the land inspected was about 5 acres in extent.

The Respondents stated that only the 1st Defendant was in occupation at

12

the time of inspection. The Respondents stated that there was no barbed-

wire fence demarcating separate allotments. The Respondents stated that

the land appeared to be a single undivided block notwithstanding the

survey plans produced by the Plaintiffs.

The Respondents stated that although the 1st Defendant had passed away

prior to the commencement of the trial, a certified copy of the record in

Chilaw Primary Court Case No. 37756 was produced and marked. The

Respondents stated that the record contained a statement made by the 1st

Defendant to the police on 04.06.1994, an affidavit dated 12.07.1994 and

a cross-affidavit dated 29.07.1994. The Respondents stated that the said

affidavits recorded that the 1st Defendant had been in uninterrupted

possession of the land, which was about 6 acres in extent, since 1951. The

Respondents stated that coconut and paddy cultivations were maintained

on the land until damage occurred due to salt-water intrusion from

neighbouring prawn-farming activities.

The Respondents stated that the police notes produced in evidence

described the land in dispute as a single block of about 6 acres, indicating

that the land had not been divided into separate allotments even as at

June 1994.

The Respondents stated that the learned Additional District Judge

delivered judgment on 20.09.2010 in favour of the original Plaintiff. The

Respondents stated that the learned Judge observed that certified copies

of the title deeds and plans had not been produced. The Respondents

stated that the learned Judge further observed that evidence of possession

from 1975 to 1993 was weak. The Respondents stated that uncertainty

remained as to whether the lands claimed by the Plaintiffs and the land

possessed by the 1st Defendant constituted one land or separate lands.

13

The Respondents stated that an appeal was preferred to the Civil Appellate

High Court of the North Western Province. The Respondents stated that

by judgment dated 16.12.2015, the Civil Appellate High Court allowed the

appeal with costs, set aside the judgment of the District Court of Chilaw

and dismissed the Plaintiffs’ action.

The Respondents stated that the present proceedings arose from the

application filed by the Added Plaintiff seeking leave to appeal from the

judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court.

Legal analysis of questions of law

(1)Title and Identity of the Corpus:-

The first question of law in this appeal is whether the Civil Appellate High

Court failed to consider that Appellant proved the title and the identity of

the corpus. This issue requires a careful examination of the evidence

adduced at the trial, including deeds, survey plans, Land Registry extracts

and witness testimony regarding possession. It also requires a review of

the findings of the Learned District Judge to determine whether the High

Court correctly applied the law relating to rei vindicatio action.

A rei vindicatio action is essentially an action in rem, founded on

ownership of property. The Plaintiff seeks to recover possession of property

from a person in unlawful possession. To succeed, the Plaintiff must

establish two fundamental elements: first, legal ownership or title to the

property; second, the proper identification of the property claimed.

Without establishing both, the Defendant is not obliged to prove any right

or defense. The burden of proof in such an action lies squarely on the

Plaintiff. Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance provides that a person

asserting a fact must prove it and Section 103 clarifies that the burden

14

of proof lies on the person legally obliged to prove a fact. In a rei vindicatio,

the Plaintiff must prove title and clearly identify the corpus; the Defendant

only needs to respond if a specific defense, such as prescriptive or adverse

possession is raised.

The Appellant relied on a series of deeds (P1 to P8) to establish title. Deed

P4 (No. 36670, 27.08.1952) shows the original owners, N.S. Don Joseph

Aloysius, K. Moises Fernando, K. Peduru Fernando and K. Francis

Fernando, becoming entitled to 4 acres and 2 roods. Deed P8 (No. 1372,

16.12.1957) purports to transfer 3 acres to Manuel Joseph Antony

Fernando, executed by only three co-owners, excluding N.S. Don Joseph

Aloysius. This omission creates a legal gap because an undivided share

remained with the absent co-owner, meaning the Plaintiff could not

acquire full ownership. The 1-acre and 2-roods land depicted in Plan P2

(Plan No. 871, 02.08.1955) was also transferred by the same three co-

owners, but the deeds do not show that N.S. Don Joseph Aloysius’ interest

was included. Deeds P6 and P7 document conditional transfers between

Antony Fernando and K. Dona Catherine Perera and finally Deed P1 (No.

1547, 07.08.1964) transfers the lands to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff

claimed possession through clay extraction activities until 1993.

A close examination of the deeds reveals deficiencies in establishing clear

title. First, the failure of all co-owners to sign critical deeds means the

Plaintiff only acquired an undivided interest, not absolute ownership.

Second, some deeds relied on conditional transfers and photocopies

without certified originals, interrupting the chain of title. Third, there is no

evidence showing that the smaller land’s undivided owner consented to

transfer, which undermines the Plaintiff’s claim of full ownership. These

15

issues are significant because in a rei vindicatio action, partial or unclear

ownership cannot support a claim for recovery of the corpus.

The second requirement is the identification of the corpus. The Plaintiff

relied on plans P2 and P3 to show the land’s boundaries and extent.

However, the lands were never surveyed or superimposed on the ground

by the court. The Plaintiff failed to establish whether the two parcels

adjoined each other or the Defendant’s land and the deeds themselves

lacked sufficient description to precisely identify the property. Without

clear identification, the property is legally unascertainable, which is fatal

to a claim in a rei vindicatio action. Ownership of non-identifiable land

cannot be vindicated.

Possession and control are also relevant. The Plaintiff testified to cutting

clay on the land until 1993. However, corroborating evidence confirms clay

was extracted only until 1975. From 1975 onwards, the only evidence of

possession comes from the Plaintiff himself, consisting of occasional visits.

Continuous and exclusive possession, necessary to support ownership

claims, is therefore lacking. The 1st Defendant and witnesses testified that

the Defendant occupied parts of the land and cultivated coconut trees.

These facts further weaken the Plaintiff’s claim to having exercised factual

control over the entirety of the corpus.

The Civil Appellate High Court noted the absence of signatures by all co-

owners, missing certified deeds, incomplete transfers and lack of clear

identification of the land. Its conclusion that the Plaintiff failed to prove

title and identity of the corpus is thus supported by the law and evidence.

The Learned District Judge may have viewed the evidence more leniently,

but upon proper analysis, the gaps in title and identification were legally

significant.

16

Sri Lankan authorities consistently emphasise that identification of the

land is indispensable in a rei vindicatio action. In Peeris v. Savunhamy

(1951) 54 NLR 207, it was held that a Plaintiff must not only prove

dominium over the land but also its boundaries by evidence admissible in

law. In Hettiarachchi v. Gunapala [2008] 2 ALR 70 at 79, the Court

held that if the Plaintiff fails to identify the land on the ground, his action

must fail. Marsoof, J., in Latheef v. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333 at

378, explained in greater detail that:

"The identity of the subject matter is of paramount importance in a rei

vindicatio action because the object of such an action is to determine

ownership of the property, which objective cannot be achieved without

the property being clearly identified. Where the property sought to be

vindicated consists of land, the land sought to be vindicated must be

identified by reference to a survey plan or other equally expeditious

method. It is obvious that ownership cannot be ascribed without clear

identification of the property that is subjected to such ownership and

furthermore, the ultimate objective of a person seeking to vindicate

immovable property by obtaining a writ of execution in terms of Section

323 of the Civil Procedure Code will be frustrated if the fiscal to whom

the writ is addressed cannot clearly identify the property by reference to

the decree for the purpose of giving effect to it. It is therefore essential in

a vindicatory action, as much as in a partition action, for the corpus to

be identified with precision."

It is also important to note the principle highlighted by Professor G.L.

Peiris in Law of Property in Sri Lanka, Vol I, at page 304: “It must be

emphasized, however, that the observations in these cases to the effect that

the plaintiff’s title must be strictly proved in a rei vindicatio, cannot be

17

accepted as containing the implication that a standard of exceptional

stringency applies in this context. An extremely exacting standard is

insisted upon in certain categories of action such as partition actions. … It

is clear that a standard characterized by this degree of severity does not

apply to the proof of a plaintiff’s title in a rei vindicatory action.” This

principle clarifies that, while the Plaintiff must establish title and identify

the corpus, the law does not require the exceptionally stringent proof

demanded in partition actions.

While the Plaintiff is not required to meet an impossible or excessively

strict standard, he must still establish both ownership and the identity of

the property. In this case, the Plaintiff failed to do so. The chain of title is

incomplete, some deeds were not executed by all co-owners and the land

was not clearly identified on the ground. Possession was intermittent and

limited and independent evidence confirmed that the Defendant occupied

and used the land.

It is also settled that undivided or partial ownership cannot support a rei

vindicatio claim. In De Silva v. Goonetilleke [1960] 32 NLR 217 at 219,

a Full Bench held that “in a rei vindicatio Action, The authorities unite in

holding that plaintiff must show title to the corpus in dispute and that if he

cannot, the action will not lie.” Similarly, in Wanigarathne v. Juwanis

Appuhamy [1962] 65 NLR 167, Justice Herat observed that “In an action

rei vindicatio the plaintiff must prove and establish his title. He cannot ask

for a declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength that the

defendant's title is poor or not established.”

Furthermore, in Karunadasa v. Abdul Hameed [1958] 60 NLR 352,

Sansoni J. held that “In a rei vindication action it is highly dangerous to

adjudicate on an issue of prescription without first going into and examining

18

the documentary title of the parties.” More recently, in Ballantuda

Achchige Don Wasantha v. Morawakage Premawathie and Others

[SC/Appeal/176/2014] decided on 17.05.2021, Justice Mahinda

Samayawardhena noted that “the stringent proof of chain of title, which is

the norm in a partition action to prove the pedigree, is not required in a rei

vindicatio action”, but the plaintiff must still show clear ownership over the

specific property claimed.

These authorities reinforce that in a rei vindicatio action, partial,

undivided, or conditional ownership is insufficient to vindicate the corpus

and that ownership must be clearly traced and supported by admissible

evidence of both title and identification. In the present case, the Plaintiff’s

chain of title is incomplete, deeds were not signed by all co-owners and the

property was not properly identified on the ground, confirming that the

Civil Appellate High Court’s findings are legally sound.

In conclusion, the Appellant did not discharge the burden of proof required

to establish full ownership or clearly identify the corpus. The deeds show

undivided ownership, the land is not sufficiently identified and possession

was not continuous or exclusive. The Civil Appellate High Court therefore

correctly held that the Plaintiff failed to prove title and identity of the

corpus.

(2) Whether the Civil Appellate High Court Erred in Law and in Fact

in Holding that the District Court Judgment Was Untenable and

Devoid of Facts:-

The second question of law pertains to whether the Civil Appellate High

Court misdirected itself, both in law and in fact, by holding that the

judgment of the Learned District Court Judge was untenable and devoid

19

of facts. This question requires an examination of the proper scope of

appellate review, particularly the extent to which an appellate court may

interfere with findings of fact made by a trial court. It engages the

principles governing the evaluation of evidence, the assessment of

credibility and the proper application of the law, including the doctrines of

onus probandi and prescriptive possession. The inquiry involves

determining whether the High Court erred in substituting its view for that

of the trial court, or whether its conclusion that the District Court

judgment was legally and factually unsustainable falls within the bounds

of legitimate appellate scrutiny.

The High Court considered whether the District Court had properly applied

the law relating to proof of ownership, chain of title and possession. The

question was whether the District Court had evaluated the plaintiff’s chain

of title deeds in conjunction with evidence of possession and whether it

had adequately addressed uncertainties regarding the identification and

demarcation of the land in dispute. The High Court observed that the trial

court relied heavily on documentary evidence of title without sufficiently

considering the elements of continuous and adverse possession, as

recognized under the law relating to prescriptive rights and onus of proof.

Furthermore, the High Court evaluated the District Court’s assessment of

the identification of the corpus, that is, the specific lands claimed. It found

that the trial court did not resolve material ambiguities concerning the

boundaries and extent of the land parcels depicted in the submitted plans

(P2 and P3), or their relation to the land in possession of the Respondents.

The High Court held that these uncertainties rendered the District Court’s

decree vulnerable to challenge, as the law requires that a plaintiff seeking

20

a declaration of title must demonstrate not only ownership but also the

ability to identify the specific subject matter with certainty.

The High Court’s review was guided by the established principle that a

trial court’s judgment is not to be overturned lightly; however, where the

evidence before the trial court is inconsistent, incomplete, or fails to

establish ownership on a balance of probabilities, an appellate court may

intervene to correct a legal error or a manifest misapprehension of facts.

The Civil Appellate High Court concluded that the District Court had failed

to apply these legal standards appropriately and that its judgment did not

adequately address critical issues, such as the continuity of possession,

identification of the land and the chain of title. Accordingly, in reviewing

whether the High Court misdirected itself, it is evident that its intervention

falls squarely within the recognized powers of appellate review. The High

Court’s finding that the District Court judgment was untenable and devoid

of sufficient factual foundation does not constitute misdirection. Rather, it

demonstrates adherence to the legal principles governing proof of title,

possession and identification of land in civil disputes, ensuring that the

decree is grounded in a proper assessment of law and fact.

(3)Burden of Proof under Sections 101 and 103 of the Evidence

Ordinance:-

The third question of law requires a careful examination of whether the

High Court misapplied the statutory provisions relating to the burden of

proof. Sections 101 and 103 of the Evidence Ordinance establish that

a party asserting a fact must prove its existence and the onus lies on the

person legally bound to establish that fact. In the context of a rei vindicatio

action, the plaintiff must first prove ownership and identify the corpus of

the property claimed, while the defendant is only required to prove

21

prescriptive or adverse possession once the plaintiff has discharged this

threshold burden.

In the present case, as mentioned before, the Appellant relied heavily on a

chain of title deeds, including P.01, P.02, P.03, P.04, P.06 and P.08, to

establish ownership of the disputed lands. However, several of these deeds

were incomplete or produced as photocopies, with certified copies never

tendered. Deed No. 1372 (P.08) was produced only in cross-examination

and Deed No. 1395 (P.06) was conditional and did not clearly convey the

1 1⁄2-acre land purportedly owned by N. S. Don Joseph Aloysius (P.04).

These defects created gaps in the chain of title, rendering the Appellant’s

claim uncertain and incomplete. Consequently, the initial burden to prove

ownership and identify the corpus was not fully discharged.

The Appellant claimed that the original plaintiff was in possession of the

land from 1975 to 1993. However, this claim was supported only by his

own evidence and the testimony of Kuruwitage Don Rathnasekera (PW 2),

a former labourer and a lorry driver, who stated that he worked at the

Ambakale tile mill and took part in clay excavation activities only during

the time between 1965 and 1970 (extending at most up to 1975).

Furthermore, the Respondent claims prescriptive rights for more than 30

years even before the Appellant occupying the land.

As emphasised in Bank of Ceylon v. Anura Gamage (SC Appeal

39/2014, 04.07.2023), “The burden of proof in a rei vindicatio action is

overwhelmingly shrouded in misconceptions and misconstructions. In order

to succeed in a rei vindicatio action, first and foremost, the plaintiff shall

prove his ownership to the property. If he fails to prove it, his action shall

fail. This principle is based on the Latin maxim ‘onus probandi incumbit ei

22

qui agit’, which means, the burden of proof lies with the person who brings

the action. Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance is also to a similar effect.”

This principle confirms that until the Appellant established both legal

ownership and the precise identification of the land, the Respondents were

not obliged to prove any claim of adverse possession. Furthermore, as held

in In Mansil v. Devaya(1985) 2 Sri LR 46, G.P.S. De Silva J. (later C.J.)

stated, “In a rei vindicatio action, on the other hand, ownership is of the

essence of the action; the action is founded on ownership.” This position

was reinforced by Professor George Wille in Wille’s Principles of South

African Law (9th Ed., 2007, p. 539), who noted as follows:

“To succeed with the rei vindicatio, the owner must prove on a balance

of probabilities, first, his or her ownership in the property. If a movable

is sought to be recovered, the owner must rebut the presumption that

the possessor of the movable is the owner thereof. In the case of

immovables, it is sufficient as a rule to show that title in the land is

registered in his or her name. Secondly, the property must exist, be

clearly identifiable and must not have been destroyed or consumed.

Money, in the form of coins and banknotes, is not easily identifiable

and thus not easily vindicable. Thirdly, the defendant must be in

possession or detention of the thing at the moment the action is

instituted. The rationale is to ensure that the defendant is in a position

to comply with an order for restoration.”

In applying these principles, it is evident that the Appellant failed to

discharge the initial onus imposed by sections 101 and 103. The

incomplete deeds, uncertified plans and lack of independent corroboration

for possession after 1975 meant that ownership and identification of the

corpus were not satisfactorily established. The High Court correctly

23

observed that the District Court erred in accepting this evidence as

sufficient to discharge the Appellant’s onus. Consequently, the High

Court’s conclusion that the District Court misapplied the law regarding

the burden of proof is legally sound and consistent with the authorities

cited above.

Accordingly, the Court finds that the Civil Appellate High Court did not err

in law in its assessment of the burden of proof under sections 101 and

103 of the Evidence Ordinance and its reasoning is consistent with

established legal principles governing rei vindicatio actions.

In these circumstances, the Appellant has failed to prove title to the land

and to establish the identity of the corpus. The Respondent, on the other

hand, has claimed prescriptive rights over the said land. It is evident that

the Respondent has claimed prescriptive rights for nearly 30 years, even

prior to the transfer of the deed to the Appellant (since the inception of the

original owner of the land).

In view of the foregoing analysis, it is evident that the Civil Appellate High

Court has correctly addressed the questions of law raised in this appeal.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court is affirmed.

The questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted are answered

in the negative and dismiss the appeal with costs.
