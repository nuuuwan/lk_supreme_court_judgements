K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J

1. The Respondents-Petitioners-Appellants (hereinafter referred to

as Appellants) instituted this application against the Petitioner-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as Respondent) and sought to

set aside the Judgment of their Lordships of the Court of Appeal

dated 17.10.2016, bearing case No. CA (Writ) 176/2014 which

was given in favour of the Respondent.

25

2. The Respondent instituted the application CA (Writ) 176/2014

before their Lordships in the Court of Appeal against the

Appellants and sought the following :

a) Grant and issue a Mandate in the nature of Writ of

Certiorari quashing the decision of the one or more or all of

the 1st to 16th Respondents to select and promote the 17

Respondent to the post of Director (Laboratory Services

Division), the 18th Respondent to the post of Director

(Product Clarification), the 19th Respondent to the post of

Director (Metrology), the 20th Respondent to the post of

Director (Scientific Standardization Division).

b) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of

Mandamus directing one or more of the 1st to 16th

Respondents to promote the Appellant to one of the three

following posts in the 15th Respondent viz. Director

(Laboratory Services Division), Director (Product

Clarification), Director (Metrology), Director (Scientific

Standardization Division).

3. The said application was taken up for argument whereupon the

parties made oral applications and thereafter were given the

opportunity to tender written submissions. Subsequently, their

Lordships of the Court of Appeal delivered the Judgement dated

17.10.2016 granting the Writs of Certiorari as prayed for in the

petition, whilst refusing the Writ of Mandamus prayed by the

Respondent in his petition.

4. Aggrieved by the said Judgment of their Lordships of the Court of

Appeal, the Appellants sought special leave from this Court, and

26

leave was granted for the question of law in paragraph 25 (b) of

the Petition dated 24.11.2016.

Question of Law

b) “Have Their Lordships of the Court of Appeal erred in law in issuing

Writs of Certiorari as prayed for in prayer (c), (d), (e) and (f) of the prayer

to the Petition marked X1 by inter-alia failing to take into consideration:

(i The M.Sc. Degree in Analytical Chemistry of the Petitioner-

Respondent had already been considered as a pre-requisite/entry

qualification for the Petitioner-Respondent to join the 1 Respondent-

Petitioner; and

(ii The said M.Sc. Degree qualification of the Petitioner-Respondent

could not be considered again as an additional qualification for the

application of the Petitioner-Respondent for the posts of Director

(Technical) of the 1st Respondent-Petitioner.”

Facts of the Matter

5. The Respondent joined the 1st appellant institution on

02.11.1987 as a Standards/Testing officer, Executive Grade VI

and was later placed in the Consulting and Training Division. At

the time of recruitment the Respondent held a B.Sc. degree in

Chemistry, Pure and Applied Mathematics and an M.Sc in

Analytical Chemistry. The Respondents’ service of confirmation

was received on 12.02.1991 and subsequently he was promoted

as Standards/Testing officer, Executive Grade III with effect from

02.11.1991, Assistant Director ( Food testing ) Executive Grade II

with effect from 15.04.1998, Assistant Director ( Food testing )

Executive Grade I with effect from 28.10.2007 and finally as

27

Senior Deputy Director HM 1-1 with effect from 26.10.2009.

(Designation of the Respondent at present).

6. In the last quarter of the year 2013, applications were called from

eligible candidates for the positions of Director (Laboratory),

Director (Metrology) and Director (Product Clarification) under

two circulars. The Respondent applied after the second circular

dated 2013-12-30 (marked and produced as P13B) was issued.

After the interviews for the aforesaid positions were held, the

position for Director (Scientific Standardization Division) also fell

vacant and thereafter final appointments were made for that post

too. The Respondents’ interview was on 28.02.2014 and it was

submitted by the Respondent that on 27.02.2014, which is a day

prior to the Respondents’ interview, the marking scheme was

changed without any explanation. Thereafter, the interview of the

Respondent has been held as scheduled.

7. Accordingly, with effect from 28.03.2014, the 17th Appellant was

made Director (Laboratory Services Division), the 18th Appellant

was made Director (Product Clarification), the 19th Appellant was

made Director (Metrology) and the 20th Appellant was made the

Director (Scientific Standardization Division) respectively.

Submissions of the parties

8. The learned Presidents’ Counsel for the Respondent submitted

that, although 20 marks had been allocated for the M.Sc/MBA

degree in both marking criteria (P-14B and P-14C) the

Respondent was not awarded a single mark for his M.Sc in

28

Analytical Chemistry but in contrast, other candidates were

awarded the full 20 marks. The Counsel further submitted that

the said Master’s degree had been awarded to him prior to his

recruitment on 2nd November 1987 as a Standards/Testing

Officer. Executive Grade VI, and therefore the position taken by

the appellants for not allocating marks is that the M.Sc of the

Respondent was considered as the Respondents’ recruitment

qualification and therefore no marks can be given for the same.

The Presidents’ Counsel argued that the Scheme of Recruitment

does not have any provision preventing the allocation of marks in

instances where the Master's Degree was a recruitment

qualification.

9. Furthermore, the learned Presidents’ Counsel for the Respondent

submitted that the Master’s degree is not a recruitment

qualification for the Standards/Testing Officer in the existing

Scheme of Promotion and Recruitments and that a Master's

degree was only an entry qualification for the post of Standards/

Testing Officer in the previous Scheme of Promotion and

Recruitments and therefore in the circumstances, the non-

allocation of a single mark for the Respondents’ M.Sc was

unreasonable.

10. At the hearing, the learned President’s Counsel for the

Respondent contended that the Court of Appeal has correctly held

that the marking scheme does not shed any light on the term

"entry" contemplate and that it is not clear whether or not the

term "Entry" speaks about the relevant post or the entry to the

institution.

29

11. On the other hand, the learned Presidents’ Counsel for the

Appellants submitted that, the reason for the failure of the

Respondent to be selected and be promoted to the post of Director

(Technical) is because admittedly during the interview and

selection process the Respondent did not receive any marks for

additional professional qualification, even though the respondent

had the M.Sc.

12. The learned Presidents’ Counsel for the Appellants submitted

that, the reason for the Respondent to not receive any marks for

the M.Sc. Degree as an additional professional qualification was

because the Respondent had already utilised the M.Sc. degree as

an entry qualification that was required by the Respondent to

initially join the 1st Appellant institution.

13. The learned Presidents’ Counsel for the Appellants further

submitted that, at the time of entry to the 1st Appellant

institution, the 17th to 20th appellants had B.Sc. Special degrees

in Science and had joined the 1st appellant by ‘only’ using their

respective degree as their entry qualification. On the other hand,

the Counsel contended that as the Respondent at the time of

joining the 1st appellant institution only had a General degree in

B.Sc. which was neither a special degree nor a general degree with

a Class, the Respondent had no choice but to utilize both his B.Sc.

in Science General degree and M.Sc. degree to satisfy the an entry

requirement to join the 1st Appellant as an employee.

14. The learned Presidents’ Counsel for the Appellants contended that

the 17th to 20th Appellants during the course of their

employment obtained M.Sc. Degrees and therefore was able to

30

utilize that as an additional qualification at the time of interview.

The Counsel further submitted that, the Respondent on the other

hand, after having joined the 1st Appellant institution did not

obtain any other further qualification thereafter and as such did

not have any additional qualification that could be used by the

Respondent at the time of interview.

15. At the hearing, the learned Presidents’ Counsel for the

Appellants also stated that, Their Lordships of the Court of Appeal

have erred in holding that the note in Guideline for Allocation of

Marks which states that, "marks should be given only for

additional higher qualifications other than entry qualification"

does not shed light as to, what "entry" it contemplates. The

Counsel contended that the entry referred to in Guideline for

Allocation of Marks is in fact the first entry of the Respondent and

the 17th to 20th Appellants to the 1st Appellant institution.

16. Addressing the alteration in the guidelines governing the

allocation of marks, the learned Presidents’ Counsel for the

Appellants submitted that although the original Guideline for

Allocation of Marks dated 21.02.2014 (at page 74 of the Brief) was

subsequently revised by the Guideline dated 27.02.2014 (at page

73 of the Brief), such modification does not in any manner affect

the applicability or relevance of the Respondent’s M.Sc.

qualification

17. In light of that, the principal issue that arises for

consideration here is whether the complaint raised by the

Respondent, that is the non-awarding of the 20 marks to the

Respondent for the M.Sc. qualification held by him at the time of

31

the interview for the post of Director (Technical) in the 1st

Appellant institution was unreasonable, arbitrary, or otherwise

contrary to law.

18. As per page 26 of the brief, and documents marked R1 and

R1A, at the time of recruitment, the qualifications for the

Respondent and the 17th to 20th Appellant to join as standard

testing officers (Grade VI) were as follows:

a. B Sc. Special degree in Science or,

b. B Sc. General degree in Science with a class or,

c. B Sc. General degree in Science and Post Graduate

Qualification,

19. Upon perusal of the documentary evidence, it is clear that at the

time of entry to the institution, the 17th - 20th Appellants had

B.Sc. Special degrees in Science, whilst the Respondent had a

B.Sc. General degree in Science without a class and a M.Sc.

Degree in Analytical Chemistry and based on those qualifications

they were selected to be employed in the 1st Appellant institution.

Thereafter, in the Course of their employment it is observed that

the 17th to 20th Appellants have obtained M.Sc. Degrees in

various fields such as Operations Research, Microbiology, Food

Science, Technology etc. At the same time it is also observed that

the Respondent did not obtain any other further qualification in

the course of his employment.

20. As previously discussed, the Respondent did not possess either a

Special Degree in Science or a General Degree in Science with a

class. Consequently, he was compelled to select Option C at the

32

time of joining the 1st Appellant institution, namely, the General

B.Sc. degree in Science together with a postgraduate qualification.

In these circumstances, it becomes evident that the reason the

Respondent was not entitled to receive additional marks for the

M.Sc. degree as a further professional qualification, is because the

said M.Sc. degree had already been utilised by him as the requisite

entry qualification for admission to the 1st Appellant institution.

21. Upon examination of the document marked P14C, it is evident that

the respondent has not been awarded any marks under the

heading “Additional Qualifications.” However, before determining

whether the respondents’ M.Sc qualification in question falls

within that category, it is necessary to consider the notation

appearing at the foot of that column, on documents marked P14C

which provides that “marks should be given only for additional

higher qualifications other than the entry qualification.” In my

view, this note makes it abundantly clear that a qualification

previously relied upon as an entry requirement cannot again be

taken into account for the purpose of allocating marks for the

promotion under consideration.

22. Their Lordships of the Court of Appeal, in their judgment, has

taken the view that the term “entry” as used in the marking

scheme P14C is ambiguous, such that it is unclear whether it

refers to entry to the advertised post or entry to the employee’s

initial post. With respect, this Court is unable to agree with that

conclusion. The term “entry,” when read in its proper context, can

only sensibly refer to entry into the 1st Appellant institution. If

“entry” were intended to mean entry into the particular post in

question, the inclusion of such a note in the guideline would serve

33

no purpose and would be redundant. Accordingly, the learned

Judges of the Court of Appeal have, in this regard, erred in stating

so.

23. Furthermore, although the learned Presidents’ Counsel for the

Respondent has submitted that the overnight alteration of the

mark sheets in documents P14B and P14C raises suspicion, such

a contention does not affect the Respondents’ eligibility. A review

of both the original and updated Guidelines for allocating marks

shows that the Respondents’ marks for the M.Sc. degree remains

unchanged. The only difference between the two versions is a

clearer notation stating that marks are granted only for

qualifications obtained beyond the entry qualification. As the

Respondent used the M.Sc. degree as the entry qualification when

joining the institution, he is not eligible for any additional marks

for it under either guideline.

24. Accordingly, this Court is of the view that Their Lordships of the

Court of Appeal erred in law in issuing Writs of Certiorari

quashing the decision of the 15th to 16th Appellants to select and

promote the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Appellants to the

respective posts of Director (Laboratory Services Division),

Director (Product Clarification), Director (Metrology), and Director

(Scientific Standardization Division). In doing so, the Court of

Appeal, inter alia, failed to take into account that the

Respondents’ M.Sc. Degree in Analytical Chemistry had already

been treated as a prerequisite or entry qualification for the

Respondents’ appointment to the 1st Appellant institution, and

therefore could not be considered once again for the purpose of

awarding marks for promotion.

34

25. For the foregoing reasons, this Court orders that the Judgment of

the Court of Appeal dated 17.10.2016 in Case No. CA (Writ)

176/2014 be set aside. The question of law is accordingly

answered in the affirmative.

The Appeal is allowed.
