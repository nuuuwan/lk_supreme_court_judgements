Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant in the District

Court of Negombo, seeking a declaration of title to the land described in the

schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the defendant therefrom, and damages.

The plaintiff’s case was that she purchased the land from the defendant by

deed marked P1. The defendant filed answer seeking the dismissal of the

action on the ground that deed P1 was a nullity. In the alternative, he

pleaded for a declaration that the plaintiff was holding the land in trust for

him, and further prayed for an order directing the plaintiff to re-transfer the

land upon acceptance of a reasonable sum within a reasonable time. His

position was that he borrowed a sum of Rs. 150,000 from the plaintiff’s

mother and executed deed P1 believing it to be a mortgage given as security

for the loan.

After trial, the learned District Judge refused to grant relief to the plaintiff

and entered judgment for the defendant granting all the reliefs as prayed

for in the answer. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Negombo set

aside the judgment of the District Court and entered judgment for the

plaintiff as prayed for in the plaint. Hence, this appeal by the defendant. A

previous Bench of this Court granted leave to appeal on the following two

questions of law:

3

SC/APPEAL/70/2020

(a) Did the High Court disregard the findings of fact made by the learned

District Judge without giving reasons for doing so?

(b) Did the High Court fail to take into consideration the attendant

circumstances necessary to establish a constructive trust?

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance states that “Where the owner of property

transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot reasonably be inferred consistently

with the attendant circumstances that he intended to dispose of the beneficial

interest therein, the transferee or legatee must hold such property for the

benefit of the owner or his legal representative.”

Where the Court can infer, as contemplated by section 83, from the

“attendant circumstances”, namely the circumstances which precede or

follow the transfer, that the owner did not intend to dispose of the beneficial

interest in the property at the time the legal interest was transferred to the

transferee, a constructive trust may be held to have been created. However,

the law does not prescribe any general rule or fixed criteria by which the

“attendant circumstances” sufficient to establish a constructive trust can

be identified. Whether a constructive trust has in fact been created is a

question of fact to be determined on unique facts and circumstances of the

case. The burden of proving the existence of a constructive trust lies on the

party asserting it, and the applicable test is objective rather than subjective.

At the trial, the plaintiff gave evidence and produced P1, the original deed

of transfer dated 15.12.1994 by which she became the owner of the land,

as well as the original title deed of the defendant dated 17.11.1983 marked

P2. Although, by deed P2, the defendant had purchased an undivided 1/5

share of a land in extent of 1 acre and 24 perches, by deed P1 the defendant

conveyed a defined portion of land in extent of 36.40 perches, identified by

reference to a survey plan, in lieu of his undivided rights. The survey plan

referred to in deed P1 had been prepared on 02.10.1984, approximately two

months prior to the execution of deed P1. Although a copy of this survey

4

SC/APPEAL/70/2020

plan was initially marked as P3, it was subsequently withdrawn.

Nevertheless, the plan clearly appears to have been prepared for the

purpose of the sale.

These circumstances do not support the contention that deed P1 was

executed merely as security for a loan transaction, but instead point to a

clear intention on the part of the defendant to part with the property by way

of an outright transfer.

The defendant was a retired police officer and not an ordinary lay person.

He had served in the Police Department for a period of 22 years. With his

experience and standing in society, he cannot be heard to say that he was

unaware of the nature of the transaction. On the face of deed P1, it is not a

mortgage, as he now claims it to be, but an outright transfer. If,

notwithstanding this, as a police officer, he proceeded to execute the deed

without appreciating its legal effect, he has only himself to blame.

Although the defendant claims that he paid interest on the alleged loan on

three occasions to the plaintiff, there is no documentary evidence to

establish that the plaintiff accepted any such payments.

On the other hand, according to the defendant’s own evidence, the plaintiff’s

mother, Malani, was the moneylender, and she was present at the Notary’s

office at the time of the execution of deed P1. If that be so, it is unclear why

the deed was written in the name of the daughter, and why any interest

payments were allegedly made to the daughter rather than to Malani

herself. Malani was not even an attesting witness to deed P1, nor was any

attempt made to call her as a witness at the trial.

There is a temporary structure on the land constructed of clay. The

defendant does not reside on the land, although there is some cultivation

thereon.

SC/APPEAL/70/2020

The learned District Judge appears to have attached undue weight to

perceived mistakes on the part of the Notary in the execution of deed P1,

rather than examining whether the attendant circumstances established

that the transaction was not an outright transfer but merely security for a

loan. While non-compliance with section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance renders a deed invalid, non-compliance with the Rules made for

Notaries under section 31 of the Notaries Ordinance does not, as is

expressly provided for in section 33 of the Notaries Ordinance. As already

stated, the burden of proving the existence of a trust lay squarely on the

defendant.

The fact that the learned District Judge granted all the reliefs prayed for in

the answer, which are mutually contradictory in law and in practical terms

unenforceable, itself suggests that he failed to adopt the correct legal

approach in a case of this character. A Court cannot declare a deed to be a

nullity and in the same breath hold that it is subject to a constructive trust.

Nor can a Court simultaneously direct the plaintiff to re-transfer the land

upon acceptance of a reasonable sum within a reasonable time. This,

however, is precisely what the learned District Judge has done.

I answer the questions of law on which leave was granted in the negative

and dismiss the appeal with costs.
