Argued on: 26.03.2025

Decided on: 03.02.2026

Dr. Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Respondent- Respondent- Petitioner- Appellant (‘Appellant’), who is the lady at the

centre of the marital proceedings in the instant Application, was originally Catholic. She

entered into marriage with the Applicant-Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent

(‘Respondent’), a Muslim, on 06.02.1989. Their union was first registered pursuant to the

Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act No. 13 of 1951, with the corresponding marriage

certificate appearing on page 127 of the brief. Just five days later, on 11.02.1989, the couple

also registered the marriage under the Marriage Registration Ordinance No. 19 of 1907,

and the registration certificate from the Registrar/District Registrar is found on page 125

of the brief. That same day, 11.02.1989, the Appellant and Respondent joined in the bonds

of holy matrimony at the Archdiocese of Colombo, and the Certificate of Marriage issued

by the Parish Priest/Assistant Parish Priest on 23.09.2012 is located on page 123 of the

brief.

It is declared that the marriage has resulted in three children, all of whom have now

attained the age of majority.

The Respondent, almost 21 years after they registered their marriage as mentioned above,

initiated a divorce action in the District Court of Colombo. He withdrew the said action

on 09.08.2012 on the basis that such an action cannot be maintained under Section 627 of

the Civil Procedure Code as the respective marriage was entered into under the Muslim

Page 4 of 12

Marriage and Divorce Law. However, the Appellant, who was represented in the District

Court, denied the fact that she entered into a marriage agreement with the Respondent

under the Muslim Law.

Thereafter, the Respondent submitted an application for a Talaq divorce in the Quazi

Court of Colombo West, which ruled on 16.02.2013, that it lacked jurisdiction to

adjudicate the matter. Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Respondent lodged a

revision application with the Board of Quazis. On 14.05.2016, the Board held that the

Quazi was indeed vested with jurisdiction to consider the Respondent's Talaq application

and accordingly directed the Quazi to undertake a fresh inquiry into the Respondent's

filing and to pronounce the Talaq in line with the said Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act.

The Appellant then filed a Leave to Appeal1 application in the Court of Appeal against the

said Order of the Board of Quazis. At present, the Appellant is contesting the impugned

judgment dated 19.10.2018, whereby the Court of Appeal endorsed the Board of Quazi’s

order dated 14.05.2016.

This Court granted Leave to Appeal in respect of the below mentioned Questions of Law

set out in paragraphs 17(1) to 17(3) and 17(5) of the Petition dated 30.11.2018:

i. Is the said Judgment erroneous and contrary to law?

ii. Has the learned Court of Appeal Judge erred in law by not considering the

documents placed before court that the Petitioner has not embraced the faith of

Islam?

iii. Has the learned Court of Appeal Judge erred in law by not considering the legal

position that the Petitioner who was a catholic at all times material, cannot contract

a valid marriage under the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act?

v. Has the learned Court of Appeal Judge erred in law by sending the case back to

the Board of Quazi to hear and determine the Talaq Application of the Respondent?

My primary focus is on the aforementioned third question of law, which queries whether

the Appellant, remaining Catholic throughout the relevant period, could validly enter into

1 Leave to Appeal application in terms of Section 62(1) of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act No. 13 of 1951

Page 5 of 12

a marriage pursuant to the said Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act. In the impugned

judgment, His Lordship Justice A. H. M. D. Nawaz in the Court of Appeal (as he was

then) addressed this matter at length. His Lordship stated that:

“In view of my holding that conversion is immaterial to the constitution of a valid

Muslim marriage between a Muslim male and a Catholic female, the question of

conversion or otherwise does not arise before me and I would remind myself that

conversion after all cannot be fully tested since, as several authors emphasize, the

thought of a man is not triable-see Tayyibji on Muslim law, The personal law of

Muslims in India and Pakistan (1968) with references to old English cases at p 7.”

The Court of Appeal held that the Appellant was a Kitabiya and remained a Kitabiya and

therefore what she entered into on 06.02.1989 was a valid marriage in the eyes of the

Muslim law (Kitab means a book, which is, a book of revealed religion. Kitabi implies a

male who believes in Christianity or Judaism. Kitabiya is a female who believes in either

of these religions). Within Sri Lanka's intricate legal heritage, the validity of interfaith

marriages under Muslim personal law exemplifies the profound integration of religious

principles and legislative frameworks. The Court of Appeal, in the impugned Judgement,

decided that the Appellant, despite being Catholic, was eligible to marry the Respondent,

as Muslim law upholds the legitimacy of unions between Muslim men and Catholic

women, without any requirement for her conversion. In reaching this conclusion, the court

examined numerous foundational sources of Muslim law in Sri Lanka that substantiate

and endorse this stance.

Among many, the primary sources considered by the Court of Appeal, the Holy Quran

(Sura Maida, permitting Muslim men to wed chaste women from the "People of the Book,"

including Christians, as Kitabiya) and Hadiths (traditions of Prophet Muhammad, PBUH)

establish this permissibility, as reiterated in Fathima Mirza v. Anzar [1971] 75 N.L.R. 295

(Weeramantry, J.). The secondary sources, including Ijma (consensus), Qiyas (analogy),

and juristic commentaries such as Mulla on Principles of Mahomedan Law (22nd ed., 2017,

p. 345), Fyzee's Outlines of Muhammadan Law (5th ed., 2008, p. 75), and Ameer Ali's

Mahommedan Law (Vol. II, p. 154), corroborate that such unions are fully valid, unlike

irregular marriages with non-Kitabiya women (e.g., Hindus, curable by conversion per

Sura II:221 and Ishan v. Panna Lal [1928], AIR Pat. 19). The Court referring to legislative

enactments, including the Muhammadan Code of 1806 (extended by Ordinance No. 5 of

Page 6 of 12

1852) and the aforesaid Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (silent on mixed marriages but

supplemented by original sources per Narayanen v. Saree Umma [1920] 21 N.L.R. 439 and

King v. Miskin Umma [1926] 26 N.L.R. 330), observed that those enactments apply via

Section 2 to Muslims without mandating dual conversion. Nikah, as a civil contract

(Khurshid Bibi v. Mohd Amin, P.L.D. 1967 S.C. 97), requires only Ijab (offer), Qubul

(acceptance), free consent (via Wali), and witnesses; no ceremony or registration is

essential for validity. Thus, the court found the marriage to be valid under Muslim Law,

rendering the issue of conversion immaterial and untestable.

The religious and statutory framework examined by the Court of Appeal culminates in its

judicial determination, deeming conversion not a cornerstone but a superfluous and

unprovable factor in such interfaith bonds. As such, the Appellant's contentions furnish

no compelling basis for departing from the established legal stance in the impugned

judgment. In light of the above, I hold that the learned Quazi has the jurisdiction to

entertain and make a suitable decision on the Respondent’s application for a Talaq divorce.

I now advert to the aforesaid second question of law. Notably, neither the Appellant nor

the Respondent has contested the pertinent extract from the Muslim Marriage Register

(the Certificate of Marriage under the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act). Thus, it could

be easily assumed that the said document (at page 127 of the Brief) is still valid in law. The

Court of Appeal aptly remarked that the Appellant refrains from asserting any post-

execution insertion of details by the Muslim Marriage Registrar. Nor does she contend

that she endorsed a blank document, given her own admission that she later discovered its

nature as a marriage certificate. Moreover, the Court highlighted the absence of any claim

of duress or inducement by the Appellant in relation to the signing of the said marriage

certificate.

The significance of the instant Case is that the parties entered into the marriage bond and

got their marriage registered under the provisions of one Act of Parliament, and

consequently, re-registering pursuant to the provisions of a different Act of Parliament.

This scenario equates to a second marriage between the same spouses, while their prior

union under a different legal framework remained subsisting.

Section 15 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 in India stipulates that any marriage

celebrated, whether before or after the commencement of the said Act, other than a

marriage solemnized under the Special Marriage Act, 1872 (No. 3 of 1872), or under the

Page 7 of 12

said Act, may be registered under the relevant Chapter by a Marriage Officer in the

territories to which the said Act extends if the conditions laid down there are fulfilled. In

contrast, Sri Lankan legislation governing Muslim marriages or those under the Marriage

Registration Ordinance lacks comparable registration mechanisms. In any event, the

Marriage between the Appellant and the Respondent extended beyond mere ceremonial

solemnization, as it was formally registered under two Acts of Parliament, within a brief

interval between both registrations.

Pursuant to Section 10 of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act of 1998 in South

Africa, a man and a woman between whom a customary marriage subsists are competent

to contract a marriage with each other under the Marriage Act, 1961 (Act 25 of 1961), if

neither of them is a spouse in a subsisting customary marriage with any other person. This

concept of remarriage is accepted under South African law, if it is only between the same

two parties. That law requires both parties to be free of any other subsisting marriage in

order to qualify under this provision of law.

I cannot find any statutory mechanism that shifts the marriage's governance from the

registration under the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act to the secular provisions of the

Marriage Registration Ordinance. Based on the material available, the intention of the

Appellant and the Respondent to enter into a marriage bond is evident, establishing

mutual awareness and volition. However, no sufficient reasons have been adduced as to

why the second and third registrations were made effective. Neither party has contended

that the initial registration was defectively conducted, thereby justifying a subsequent one.

It may be presumed that spouses in an existing marriage can enter into a subsequent union

under an alternative legal regime to avail themselves of benefits such as inheritance,

maintenance, divorce, and polygamy rights, potentially available under the governing law

of that second registration, a practice occasionally sanctioned in certain foreign

jurisdictions. Additionally, it is noted that the merger of the personality or property of a

Muslim woman is not recognised upon her marriage, and accordingly, her personal civil

rights or the property owned by her do not affect. Nonetheless, our law does not provide

a mechanism to convert or additionally register a valid marriage under the Marriage

Registration Ordinance after the initial registration under the Muslim Marriage and

Divorce Act.

The Court of Appeal also, in the impugned judgement, has dealt with the possible

consequences when the same parties marry again under a different system of law and also

the issue of whether they can change their marital regime so soon after the first marriage.

In addressing the aforementioned matter, the Court of Appeal referred to Natalie

Abeysundere v. Christopher Abeysundere and another (1998) 1 Sri.LR 185, deeming it the

precedent that has conclusively determined this issue in Sri Lanka. The said Supreme

Court decision lays down the proposition that if the first marriage is under one system of

law, the marriage must first be dissolved under that system of law, and it is only thereafter

that parties can contract a second marriage under a different system of law. The said

Natalie Abeysundere case focused on a subsequent marriage between one spouse of the

earlier marriage and a third party. There is no doubt that no fresh marriage agreement can

be entered into unless the first marriage is dissolved, but our law does not precisely outline

any provisions which deal with remarriage or reregistration between the same two parties

while the first registration persists.

In this context, the determination in Katchi Mohamed v Benedict 63 NLR 505 is of

paramount importance. The Supreme Court in the said case has dealt with Section 18 of

the Marriage Registration Ordinance together with the interpretation given to the phrase

‘marriage’ in Section 64 of the same Act. Under the said Section 64, "marriage" means

any marriage, save and except marriages contracted under and by virtue of the Kandyan

Marriage Ordinance, 1870 or the Kandyan Marriage and Divorce Act, and except

marriages contracted between persons professing Islam. In the meantime, the said Section

18 reads:

‘No marriage shall be valid where either of the parties thereto shall have contracted a prior

marriage which shall not have been legally dissolved or declared void’.

T. S. Fernando J. (with the concurrence of Basnayake C.J. and Gunasekara J.) in the

Katchi Mohamed case took the view that a marriage in the expression ‘a prior marriage’ in

the same section 18 is not limited to a marriage as defined in section 64, and the context

requires that it be given its ordinary and natural meaning and interpreted as denoting any

legally recognised marriage. In the impugned judgement, the Court of Appeal, referring to

the above Katchi Mohamed case, decided as follows:

“Interpreting the expression "a prior marriage" in Section 18 inpari materia, E.H.T.

Gunasekara, J. too opined that the term must be understood to mean any marriage

Page 9 of 12

and not any marriage except a Kandyan or Muslim marriage. In other words, the

expression "a prior marriage" would mean any marriage which includes a Muslim

marriage. If this prior marriage is not annulled or terminated, the 2nd marriage

would be invalid by virtue of Section 18 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance. I

am fortified in this approach by the opinions of the three learned Lordships who

decided Katchi Mohamed v Benedict (supra). The prior marriage of the Appellant

and the Respondent was contracted under Muslim law. This marriage had to be

legally dissolved or declared void before either contracted a 2nd marriage under the

General Marriage Ordinance. It makes no difference that the couple who got

spliced in the first marriage are the same two persons who purported to marry a

second time. The 2nd marriage would be invalid if the first marriage remains

intact”.

I endorse the construction of Section 18 of the Marriage Registration Ordinance as

articulated in the Katchi Mohamed decision. Accordingly, I concur with the Hon. Judge of

the Court of Appeal in the impugned judgement where he has decided the second marriage

of the Appellant and Respondent under the Marriage Registration Ordinance would have

no impact whatsoever on their first Muslim marriage, as the first Muslim marriage

continued to remain valid and ipso facto the second marriage was void.

Notwithstanding the above conclusion, I need to elaborate for the interest of justice,

whether the Appellant and the Respondent committed an offence in terms of Section 362B

of the Penal Code by re-registering their marriage pursuant to the Marriage Registration

Ordinance. Upon careful perusal of the provisions of the said section 362B, including its

exception clause and the proviso, I am of the opinion that the Penal sanction embodied in

the said section 362B will be operative if either spouse contracts a subsequent marriage

with a third party. Conversely, Section 362B does not explicitly preclude the re-registration

of a marriage between the same spouses while the original registration subsists; however,

this provision cannot be viewed in isolation but must be construed within the wider

statutory framework. In forming the above view, I was influenced with the statement made

in Law and the Marriage Relationship in Sri Lanka (by Shirani Ponnambalam, 2nd Revised

Edition, 1987, Lakehouse Investments Limited, P78) which states: “it is a noteworthy

feature of our law that not only has it recognised customary marriages, thereby giving rise to a mode

of solemnization which exists side by side with the statutory requirement of registration”. For

Page 10 of 12

completeness, I must clarify that the preceding discussion in this judgment does not

encompass marriages by habit and repute.

In parliamentary democracies like Sri Lanka, where statutes delineate specific regimes for

registration (e.g., marriages, companies, or land titles), a core principle of administrative

and civil law precludes re-registering an act or item already validly registered under one

Act of Parliament with another Act for the identical purpose or requirement, except where

explicitly mandated or allowed by another provision of law. Registration under a specific

Act confers conclusive legal status, as intended by Parliament. Re-registration under a

parallel statute would undermine this finality, treating the original as provisional or

defective. Duplicate entries create conflicting records, complicating verification by courts,

registries, or third parties. Moreover, re-registration could ostensibly enable parties to

selectively pursue more advantageous legal frameworks, thereby inviting risks of fraud,

evasion of obligations or inequality. Notwithstanding the above, it is noted that rare

allowances re-registration may be warranted, without contravening any statutory

provisions, upon exceptional circumstances such as defective initial registrations (e.g., via

rectification), etc., but not for valid ones.

For the reasons given above, I conclude that within our prevailing legal framework,

spouses who have registered their marriage pursuant to one statutory regime cannot

subsequently re-register it under the provisions of a separate Act of Parliament during the

subsistence of the initial registration. The notion of re-registering a marriage under a

different Act of Parliament while the initial union remains intact raises profound questions

of validity, equity and public policy. This proposition stems from the fundamental

principle that a marriage once validly registered under one legal regime cannot be

supplanted or duplicated by a subsequent registration under another valid legislation

without first dissolving the original bond. This rule, enshrined in statutory provisions and

judicial precedents, safeguards against the chaos of dual marital statuses. Even if the

parties are identical, the second marriage is invalid if the first marriage is still in effect.

The fourth question of law, inter alia, on which this Court granted Leave to Appeal,

queries whether the Court of Appeal erred in law by referring the matter to the Board of

Quazi for adjudication and determination of the Respondents’ Talaq application. At this

point, it is essential to assess whether the initial marriage registration between the

Page 11 of 12

Appellant and the Respondent, conducted under the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act,

may be dissolved by any court, tribunal, or institution other than the learned Quazi.

There is no doubt that I have already decided that the second registration of marriage

under the Marriage Registration Ordinance is void. However, Section 19 of the said

Ordinance stipulates that no marriage shall be dissolved during the lifetime of the parties

except by judgement of divorce a vinculo matrimonii2 pronounced in some competent court.

This prompts me to have regard to the judgement in Liyanage Champika Harendra Silva v

W. M. M. B. Weerasekara, Registrar General CA/Writ/266/2021, decided on 01.12.2023,

wherein the Court of Appeal decided that there cannot be any restrictions for a marriage

entered into in Sri Lanka under the Marriage Registration Ordinance to be dissolved in a

competent court in a foreign country and a valid decree of such dissolution of marriage

entered into in a foreign country can be given effect, subject to the guidelines formulated

in the said judgement. Meanwhile, the ‘Reciprocal Recognition, Registration and

Enforcement of Foreign Judgements’ Act No. 49 of 2024 provides that, in respect of

judgments for the dissolution or annulment of a marriage or the separation of spouses, the

provisions of the Act shall apply solely to marriages registered under the said Marriage

Registration Ordinance and, subject to its other terms, to judgments from foreign courts

specified in an Order issued under Section 2 of the Act.

Pursuant to Section 596 of the Civil Procedure Code, all actions for divorce a vinculo

matrimonii, or for separation a mensa et thoro or for declaration of nullity of marriage can

be initiated in an appropriate District Court. Anyhow, Section 627 of the same Code

explicitly exempts, unless otherwise provided, the applicability of its provisions to

marriages governed by the Kandyan Marriage and Divorce Act (Chapter 113) or the

Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (Chapter 115), including any unions involving persons

professing Islam or those subject to the said Kandyan Act. Based on such a legal

framework, neither spouse in the instant case possesses the right to seek a divorce a vinculo

matrimonii from the District Court. Moreover, dissolutions of Muslim marriages under the

Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act are exclusively within the jurisdiction of a Quazi duly

appointed by the Judicial Service Commission pursuant to that Act. Consequently, even

2 Upon wide reading it is observed that vinculo matrimonii is a concept from Christian (especially ecclesiastical) and English common law marriage. It assumes marriage is a sacramental, indissoluble bond that can only be ended by a special form of divorce from the bond of marriage. Muslim marriage, however, is legally and conceptually different. It appears that there is no mechanism for a Muslim marriage to be dissolved by a special vinculo type decree.

Page 12 of 12

should the Appellant and Respondent obtain a divorce decree from a foreign jurisdiction

under any applicable valid legal system, enforcement in Sri Lanka may prove unattainable

under the aforementioned Act. Thus, I do not consider the impugned decision of the

Court of Appeal to remit the matter to the learned Quazi has been made erroneously.

Finally, based on the foregoing considerations, I proceed to answer the aforementioned

Questions of Law in the negative. In these circumstances, the Judgement dated 19.10.2018

of the Court of Appeal is affirmed. Accordingly, the instant Appeal is dismissed. I order

no costs.
