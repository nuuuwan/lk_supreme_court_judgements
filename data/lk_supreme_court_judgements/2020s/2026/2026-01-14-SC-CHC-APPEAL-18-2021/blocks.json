The clause provides several possible calculations for interest, namely 6.75% + 3M LIBOR or 8% or any higher rate or interest as may be specified. The learned President\u2019s Counsel argues that there is no wording which sets out as to how or which interest rate shall be applicable for the calculation.

It is also seen from the cross examination that the Respondents\u2019 witness has repeatedly answered that the 6.75% above 3 months LIBOR was less than the 8% p.a., and so what the Respondent bank has charged is 8% p.a. The Respondents\u2019 witness, upon repeated questioning, stated that had the LIBOR rate been higher than 8% per annum, the Respondent bank would not have applied the 8% rate but would instead have charged interest at the prevailing LIBOR rate.
