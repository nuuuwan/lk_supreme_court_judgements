THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

1. The Petitioner, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court, filed this fundamental rights

application before this Court on 07th August 2018, alleging a continuous violation of his

fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution by the conduct of

the 1st and/or 2nd Respondents, for their failure to duly pay His Lordship’s pension

entitlements.

2. At the time of instituting the instant fundamental rights application, the Petitioner was

not being paid his monthly pension without any valid reason. Having heard both parties,

on 04th November 2022, this Court granted leave to proceed in terms of Article 12(1) of

the Constitution.

3. Consequent to clarifications sought by the Attorney-General from the Secretary, Ministry

of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government,

material documents which were previously not made available to the Attorney-General’s

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 78

Department were furnished to the said department by the Ministry’s letter dated 17th

March 2023.

4. Maintaining the highest traditions of the Attorney-General’s Department and that of the

legal profession, the learned Deputy Solicitor General filed all such documents by motion

dated 24th March 2023, owing to their significant in duly considering the questions before

us.

5. Subsequently, as the learned Deputy Solicitor General filed such additional documents,

which were not previously available to the Petitioner, the Petitioner was granted

permission to file an Amended Petition. On the same date, the Petitioner was permitted

to add the Registrar of the Supreme Court and the Secretary of the Ministry of Public

Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils and Local Government (hereinafter

referred to as ‘Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration’ or ‘Secretary to the

Ministry’) as the 26th and 27th Respondents. Thereafter, the Amended Petition dated 27th

September 2023 was filed by the Petitioner as permitted.

6. Objections were filed by the 1st, 2nd and 27th Respondents on 19th April 2023, 25th March

2024 and 28th March 2024, respectively. The Petitioner filed his Counter Affidavit on 14th

May 2024.

THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THE APPLICATION

The Petitioner’s Submissions

7. Petitioner states that he was compelled to file the instant application on 07th August 2018,

as the full monthly pension entitlement payable to the Petitioner was entirely denied by

the 1st Respondent. However, shortly after filing this application, the 1st Respondent had

commenced the payment of his monthly pension, thus altering the scope of the initial

application.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 78

8. Although the Petitioner’s pension is now being paid to him, the Petitioner claims that the

deduction of certain percentages towards the recovery of the lump sum—which is termed

‘commuted pension’—paid to the Petitioner upon his retirement to be blatantly violative

of Article 108(2) of the Constitution and his own fundamental rights enshrined in Article

12(1) of the Constitution.

9. Having begun his career as a judicial officer on 01st January 1983, the Petitioner had served

as a Magistrate, a District Judge, a Judge of the High Court of the Republic, as well as a

Civil Appellate High Court Judge before being elevated to the Court of Appeal on 27th

March 2008 and, thereafter, the Supreme Court on 17th December 2014.

10. Having served well over nine years as a Judge of the Superior Courts, the Petitioner had

retired on 07th August 2017, after thirty-four years and seven months of judicial service.

11. However, the Petitioner states that he was not paid his monthly pension entitlement for

a long period of time, which compelled him to write a letter to the 1st Respondent dated

25th May 2018,1 through his Attorneys-at-Law, demanding the due payment of his

monthly pension. However, the Petitioner had not even received a response to this letter

12. The 1st Respondent admitted this delay in paragraph 29 of his Statement of Objections.2

The 1st Respondent admits therein that the payment of pension to the Petitioner, which

ought to have commenced on or about 10th September 2017, was not paid to him until

27th September 2018, i.e. until after the institution of this fundamental rights application.

13. Explaining the reasons for this extreme delay of over a year in paying the Petitioner’s

pension, the 1st Respondent claims that the Petitioner failed to attend the initial interview

1 Marked ‘M’, appended to the Amended Petition

2 By Affidavit dated 10th April 2024

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 78

at the Department of Pensions, as is the usual practice when receiving a pension.

14. In this regard, the Petitioner submitted that there is no legal requirement to attend such

an interview and that the Director General of Pensions had no legal authority whatsoever

to require any person to attend such an interview or to withhold any person’s pension

benefits on the basis of not attending such an interview, when all documents that are

necessary to process his or her application for pension has been properly submitted.

15. The Petitioner further submits that, even when his pension benefits were paid, he had not

received the entire pension benefit that he is entitled to.

16. According to the Petitioner, under and by virtue of the Public Administration Circular No.

44/90 dated 18th October 1990, which was given effect to by Gazette Notification No. 709

dated 03rd April 1992, a judge who retires after 30 years of reckonable service was eligible

to receive a commuted pension and an unreduced pension of 90% of his or her salary as

of the date of retirement, notwithstanding the fact that such judge had drawn a

commuted pension.

17. What concerns the instant application now, in essence, relates to several decisions taken

by one or more of the Respondents to discontinue the paying of pension without any

deductions where a judge of a Superior Court opts to obtain the ‘commuted pension’ and

subsequent steps taken by the Respondent to recover the same from some retired judges

to whom this benefit has already been accrued.

18. Admittedly, the decision-making process and the steps taken by the government

authorities towards this end is far from straightforward. However, the Post-Argument

Written Submissions of the Respondents and the Statements of Objections filed by the

1st Respondent, the Director General of Pensions,3 as well as the 27th Respondent, the

3 By Affidavit dated 10th April 2024

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 78

Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration,4 gave this Court with a much clearer

picture of this convoluted process. According to their Objections, the sequence of events

is as follows.

The Sequence of Events Leading to the Instant Application as Revealed by the

Statements of Objections of the 1st and 27th Respondents

Pension Entitlements of Superior Court Judges

19. The 1st and the 27th Respondents state that the pension benefits of judges of the Court of

Appeal and of the Supreme Court (collectively referred to as the ‘Superior Courts’ in this

Judgment), other judicial officers, as well as the public officers in general, are governed

by the Minutes on Pensions.

20. According to Section 51 of the said Minutes, the Minister of Public Administration, Local

Government and Home Affairs may, from time to time, by Notification published in the

Gazette, alter, add to or otherwise amend the said Minutes on Pensions.

21. According to the 1st Respondent, as at 17th October 1990—prior to Circular No. 44/90

coming into effect—judges of Superior Courts were entitled to a maximum monthly

pension of 85% of their salary upon completing 3 years of service in terms of Gazette No.

359 dated 19th July 1985. The said 3-year period was subsequently amended to read as

36 months by Gazette No. 1190/18 dated 28th June 2001.

22. If a judge elected to receive the commuted pension during this period, they were then

paid a reduced pension for the first 120 months, in terms of Section 2A of the Minutes of

Pensions. The exact averment in the 1st Respondent’s Objections is as follows:

“As per the records available with the Department of Pensions, the Judges of the

4 By Affidavit dated 25th March 2024

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 15 of 78

Superior Courts were entitled to the monthly pension at the rates mentioned in the

above Gazettes. If they elected to receive the commuted pension/gratuity, then they

were paid a reduced monthly pension for the first 120 months, in terms of Section

2A of the said Minutes [Minutes on Pensions]…”5

Additional Benefits Introduced by P.A. Circular No. 44/90

23. However, by the aforementioned Public Administration Circular No. 44/90 dated 18th

October 1990,6 several benefits were made available to public officers, and Section 2A of

the Minutes on Pensions was amended by Gazette No. 709 dated 03rd April 19927 to give

effect to the same.

24. The said benefits as reflected in Paragraph 3(C) of the said Circular are as follows:

“A public Officer who has completed 30 years of services of services and over, will be

eligible, on retirement, to receive a pension calculated on the basis of 90% his salary

at retirement as follows;

(i) the commuted pension and

(ii) the unreduced monthly pension (90% of his salary at retirement)

notwithstanding the fact that he has drawn a commuted pension, on

retirement.”8

25. The Respondents further state that the judges of the Superior Courts, too, were eligible

to the same benefits under and in terms of Section 25 read with Section 2A of the Minutes

on Pensions, and this benefit was accordingly granted to the judges of Superior Courts.

P.A. Circulars Nos. 32/96 & 32/96(1) and Gazette No. 981

26. However, the operation of Circular No. 44/90 was subsequently brought to an end with

effect from 24th December 1996 by Public Administration Circular No. 32/96 dated 12th

November 19969 read with Public Administration Circular No. 32/96(1) dated 16th

December 199610. Minutes on Pensions were accordingly amended by Gazette No. 981

dated 19th June 199711.

27. The Respondents state that, following the aforementioned changes, judges of the

Superior Courts were to receive 85% of the last drawn salary as a pension without any

deductions, and if any judge opted for a commuted pension, then such judge would have

received a reduced pension of 75% of the last drawn salary for the first 120 months.

28. This scheme sought to not only reduce the pension entitlements by 5%, but also to

remove the benefit of continuing to receive an unreduced pension where a judge opts for

commuted pension/gratuity. According to the 1st Respondent, these provisions reflect the

scheme which existed before Circular No. 44/90 came into force.

29. As the 1st Respondent points out, Justice H.W. Senanayake, who retired on or about 10th

March 1997, had been paid a reduced monthly pension purportedly in accordance with

Gazette No. 981 dated 19th June 1997.

Advice Sought from the Attorney-General in 1997 [Attorney-General’s First

Opinion, dated 15th September 1997] & Why Pension Payments of Superior

Court Judges Continued under P.A. Circular No. 44/90 till 2017

30. Prior to the retirement of late Justice P. Ramanathan, the Registrar of the Supreme Court,

by letter dated 11th August 1997, had sought clarification from the Secretary to the

Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs & Plantation Industries regarding the

applicability of said Gazette No. 981 to the judges of Superior Courts in light of Article

108(2) of the Constitution.

31. The said Secretary had thereafter consulted the Attorney-General and the Attorney-

General had accordingly tendered advice to the Secretary by letter dated 15th September

1997.12 In this letter, late K.C. Kamalasabayson, PC, Additional Solicitor General

(subsequently the Attorney-General), on behalf of the then Attorney-General, had

specifically advised, in light of Article 108(2) of the Constitution, as follows:

“…upon the appointment of a judge, eventhough his pension entitlement could be

increased at any stage, once increased such entitlement cannot be varied or altered,

if such variation or alteration would have the effect of reducing the pension payable

to him.

In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the pension payable to Hon. P.

Ramanathan has to be computed on the basis of the Public Administration Circular

No. 44/90. In this context, Gazette No. 981 of 19.6.97 has no application to the judges

referred to in Article 108(2) as it has the effect of reducing their pension entitlement.”

32. Very clearly, the Attorney-General has opined that Justice Ramanathan’s pension ought

to be computed in line with Circular No. 44/90 and that Gazette No. 981 of 19th June 1997

12 Marked ‘G’, appended to the Amended Petition

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 18 of 78

has no application to the judges referred to in Article 108 of the Constitution.

33. This is, in fact, the first of many instances when Attorney-General’s advice has been sought

in relation to this same matter. In all such instances, successive Attorney-Generals have

consistently reiterated the same position. I shall advert to this morefully later on.

34. Upon receiving the Attorney-General’s advice, the said Secretary to the Ministry has

directed the Director General of Pensions, by letter dated 01st October 1997, to proceed

to calculate the pension entitlements of Justice Ramanathan in light of that advice.

35. The 1st Respondent also states that following these events, during the period of October

1997 and May 2001, he made various requests, directly and through the Secretary to the

Ministry of Public Administration, to several authorities, such as the legal draftsman, to

ensure the amendment of the Minutes on Pensions in accordance with said advice.

36. According to the said Respondent, pursuant to such requests, Section 25 of the Minutes

on Pension was amended, by Gazette No. 1190/18 dated 28th June 2001, to take effect

retrospectively from 24th December 1996. By this amendment, the monthly pension of the

judges of the Superior Courts who serve more than 36 months was set to be 90% of the

last salary. However, this Gazette does not appear to have amended or introduced any

provisions relating to the deduction of commuted pensions.

Audit Query in 2015 and the Audit and Management Committee Meeting

37. Whilst the pension was so being paid without any deductions to the judges of the

Superior Courts, in accordance with the Attorney-General’s advice, the Department of

Pensions had received an Audit Query dated 16th February 201513 from the Auditor-

General’s Department relating to the non-recovery of the commuted pension from the

13 Marked ‘1R22’, appended to 1st Respondent’s Statement of Objections

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 19 of 78

judges of the Superior Courts by the Department of Pensions. This matter had been

further discussed at the Audit and Management Committee Meeting of the Ministry of

Public Administration,14 with the Secretary of the said Ministry [27th Respondent] and the

Director General of Pensions [1st Respondent] in attendance. Before this matter was

considered at the said meeting, the Audit Query had been taken up before the Parliament

Committee on Public Accounts (COPA).

38. At the aforementioned Audit and Management Committee Meeting, a decision had been

made to recover the commuted pension from the judges of the Superior Courts. The 1st

Respondent in the affidavit states that he was not aware of the matters adverted to above,

regarding the Circular No. 44/90, the clarification sought by the Registrar of the Supreme

Court and the Attorney-General’s advice regarding the pension of judges, etc., at the time

of attending the said meeting. Accordingly, said matter had not been considered during

the meeting when the decision to recover the commuted pension was made.

39. The 2nd Respondent, the incumbent Auditor-General of Sri Lanka, in his Statement of

Objections,15 states that the letter of the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration,

dated 03rd September 1997, addressed to the Attorney-General and the Attorney-

General's advice pursuant to such letter, as well as the subsequent opinion given by the

Attorney-General in 2018, were all brought to his attention for the first time by the

Amended Petition of the Petitioner dated 27th September 2023.

40. Accordingly, it is clear that the Auditor-General, at the time of issuing the above Audit

Query, as well as the Director General of Pensions and the aforementioned Audit and

Management Committee of the Ministry, were unaware of the factual context and the legal

14 Meeting minutes are produced marked ‘1R24’, appended to 1st Respondent’s Statement of Objections

15 By Affidavit dated 21st March 2024

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 20 of 78

basis of continuing the payment of pension to the Superior Court judges without

recovering the ‘commuted pension’.

41. In spite of this, following the decision taken at the Audit and Management Committee

Meeting of the Ministry of Public Administration, the Department of Pensions had effected

deductions from the pension paid to the former Chief Justice K. Sripavan, who retired on

or about 01st March 2017.

42. The 1st Respondent states that such deductions were thereafter effected from all retired

judges of the Superior Court to date.

Advice Sought from the Attorney-General in 2017 [Attorney-General’s

Second Opinion, January 2018]

43. Following a letter dated 28th June 2017 by the Registrar of this Court, highlighting the

unconstitutionality of such deduction, the Director General of Pensions had once again

sought legal advice from the Attorney-General by letter dated 14th July 2017. Accordingly,

in January 2018, the Attorney-General had sent his advice to the Director General of

Pensions.16

44. In this advice, Mr. Nerin Pulle, then Deputy Solicitor General (now Additional Solicitor

General and President’s Counsel), countersigned by M.N.B. Fernando, PC, Senior

Additional Solicitor General (as Her Ladyship the former Chief Justice was then) on behalf

of the Attorney-General, has opined that judges of the Superior Courts are to be

considered a distinct class of persons, in line with Article 108 of the Constitution, and that

their salaries or pension benefits cannot be reduced after appointment.

45. In the said advice, the Attorney-General has further noted the fact that such power to deal

with matters relating to judges' salaries has been reposed in the parliament by the

Constitution and that any form of interference with this power, in contravention of the

Constitution, would adversely affect the independence of the judiciary.

Cabinet Decisions in 2019 and 2020

46. By Cabinet Memorandum [No. PS/CP/149/2019] dated 24th June 2019,17 then

President, Maithripala Sirisena, had sought the Cabinet approval ‘to recover the commuted

pension of Judges of the Superior Court in 120 months in accordance with the laws in force’

and ‘to present a resolution to Parliament in this regard.’ Thereafter, having considered the

recommendations of a Cabinet-appointed Sub-Committee,18 the Cabinet of Ministers had

granted its approval to the above two proposals on 19th July 2019.

47. The aforesaid Cabinet Memorandum was filed of record, and I shall proceed to address

several other concerns relating to the same further along in this judgment.

48. Once again, on 16th November 2020, the Cabinet of Ministers had decided that the earlier

Cabinet Decision dated 19th July 2019 ‘should stand’ and instructed the Secretary to the

Cabinet to intimate the said decision to the Attorney-General for necessary action with

regard to the instant case, as this fundamental rights application was pending before this

Court at this point in time. This second Cabinet Decision had been taken pursuant to a

Note to the Cabinet of Ministers dated 12th November 2020 by the Secretary to the

Cabinet.

49. It is noteworthy that, as the 1st and 27th Respondents reveal in their Statements of

Objections, the aforementioned Cabinet Memorandum and the Note to the Cabinet of

17 Marked ‘I’, appended to the Amended Petition

18 A different Sub-Committee to that which has been specifically considered later in this Judgment

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 22 of 78

Ministers make no mention of Circular No. 44/90, clarifications sought by the Registrar

of the Supreme Court, legal advice given by the Attorney-General or the documentary

material and other matters relating to the promulgation of Gazette No. 1190/18.

50. As such, it appears that, much like the Audit and Management Committee of the Ministry

of Public Administration, the Cabinet of Ministers, too, had made the decisions to recover

the commuted pension from judges of the Superior Courts without considering such vital

material relating to the factual and legal circumstances of the matter.

51. This is further clear from the fact that, upon becoming aware of the aforementioned

documents during the course of the instant application, the 1st Respondent, by letter

dated 25th May 2023, addressed to the Ministry of Public Administration, had requested

that the same be brought to the attention of the President and the Cabinet of Ministers.

52. Accordingly, the attention of the Cabinet of Ministers had only been drawn to these

documentary materials by the Cabinet Memorandum dated 14th December 2023 by

then President, Ranil Wickremasinghe. Subsequent to this Memorandum, by Decision

dated 18th December 2023, the Cabinet had referred the matter to a Cabinet Sub-

Committee, chaired by the Minister of Justice, to further consider this matter and

provide recommendations.19

53. The Report containing the recommendations of this Cabinet Sub-Committee was made

available to this Court by the Attorney-General, and much like the previously mentioned

Cabinet Memorandum dated 24th June 2019, this Report, too, contains some

constitutionally precarious findings which warrant closer scrutiny.

Parliamentary Resolutions

54. Pursuant to this Cabinet Decision dated 19th July 2019, two Order Papers have been placed

before the Parliament, seeking a determination to recover the pension gratuity of judges

of the Superior Courts within 12 months in accordance with the law. As the first Order

Paper dated 23rd August 2019 had not been proceeded with, the second Order Paper

dated 23rd October 2019 had then been placed before the Parliament.

55. As the Petitioner submits, the Parliament was prorogued on 02nd December 2019 and no

determination had been made in this regard.

ANALYSIS & OPINION OF THE COURT

56. The questions this Court ought to consider in deciding this matter, and the matter itself

in general, considered in its proper context, transcend the rights of the Petitioner himself

as well as that of other retired judicial officers affected by the impugned actions and/or

decisions of the Respondents. This is a matter that strikes at the very core of the State

apparatus, for it concerns the manner in which the sovereignty of the people is exercised

by the three organs of government and the friction between such organs that may be

created by even the simplest of administrative acts, whether deliberate or inadvertent.

57. As I pen down this judgment, where this Court is called to interpret the provisions relating

to the salaries and pensions of its own judges, whilst speaking of the independence of the

judiciary as a principle to which this matter so intimately relates in the same breath, it is

not lost on me that some may perceive this exercise with a sense of irony. Some might

see it as a judge sitting his own case. They might murmur that it would have been more

expedient—perhaps even judicious—to resolve this administratively, as was done in the

United Kingdom when some of our British counterparts were confronted with a similar

quandary. I am compelled to note that the Petitioner has come before this Court having

exhausted all alternatives, in a setting where he had received not a penny in pension for

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 24 of 78

well over a year after his retirement. This is plainly apparent on the face of the Petition

and from the material placed before this Court by the Director General of Pensions.

58. However undesirable an ostensible impression of prejudgment may be, the Petitioner has

been compelled, by the continued denial of his pension entitlements, to invoke the sole

and exclusive constitutional jurisdiction of this Court—not only to canvass his own rights

but also to champion the very integrity of our constitutional scheme, which clearly places

the independence of the judiciary as an institution in high regard—for no other authority

is constitutionally empowered to answer the questions before us as Article 125(1) of the

Constitution sets out.

59. This would also not be the first time that a judicial officer had to seek judicial intervention

to secure their dues. Chief Judge of New York famously sued the state legislature in 2008

for denying the judges’ constitutional right to an adequate salary.20 US Federal judges

have also followed suit and pursued litigation. Long before, in 1997, another group of US

judges filed a lawsuit when they were excluded from automatic pay adjustments by

Congress, arguing that such exclusion, preventing them from receiving pay raises, was

violative of the Compensation Clause of the US Constitution.21 While I shall deal with such

provisions from comparative jurisdictions later, what I wish to emphasise for the moment

is that suits of this nature are by no means an anomaly.22 When every other avenue proves

20 Kaye v. Silver, No. 400763/08 (N.Y. App. Div.)

21 See Williams v. United States, 48 F. Supp. 2d 52 (D.D.C. 1999); Williams v. United States, 240 F.3d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2001)

Government of the Nct of Delhi, 1999 III AD (DELHI) 297, 78 (1999) DLT 849, 1999 (49) DRJ 532 (where similar issues were canvassed before the Delhi High Court); For many other examples, see Justin S. Teff, ‘The Judges v. The State: Obtaining Adequate Judicial Compensation and New York’s Current Constitutional Crisis’ (2009) 72 Albany Law Review 191

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 25 of 78

futile, it is to the law that we ultimately turn, for it remains the last refuge of all—judge or

not.

60. I am also reminded of how this Court was similarly called to walk the tightropes of judicial

interpretation more than once before when it was called to consider provisions relating

to tenure, appointment, and dismissal of judges. In all such instances, this Court has been

most careful, exercising restraint and only interpreting such provisions in a manner that

manifests the norms embedded therein in line with its constitutional mandate. I do not

see why this instance should be any different. The Petitioner has anchored his claims in

sound and enduring principles of law, not in abstractions of thought or emotive appeals;

and the legal provisions at issue are framed in a clarity of language seldom encountered.

61. In addition, it also appears that some guidance may be available from several other

jurisdictions where similar issues have previously arisen and from numerous academic

commentaries and scholarly studies focussing on the connexion between judicial

independence and judge’s emolument or pension with reference to many cautionary

accounts from history.23

Article 108 of the Constitution and Judicial Independence

62. Article 108 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka states as follows:

(1) The salaries of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the Court of Appeal shall

23 See for example, Justin S. Teff (2009) supra note 22; James M Anderson & Eric Helland, ‘How Much Should Judges Be Paid? An Empirical Study on the Effect of Judicial Pay on the State Bench’ (2012) 64 Stanford Law Review 1277 – which I myself found greatly helpful; Joanna M Shepherd, ‘Money, Politics, and Impartial Justice’ (2009) 58:4 Duke Law Journal 623; James E Pfander, ‘Judicial Compensation and the Definition of Judicial Power in the Early Republic (2008) 107:1 Michigan Law Review 1; Irvin R Kaufman, ‘The Essence of Judicial Independence’ (1980) 80:4 Columbia Law Review 671; Sam J Ervin Jr., ‘Separation of Powers: Judicial Independence’ (1970) 35:1 Law and Contemporary Problems 108

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 26 of 78

be determined by Parliament and shall be charged on the Consolidated Fund.

(2) The salary payable to, and the pension entitlement of a Judge of the Supreme

Court and a Judge of the Court of Appeal shall not be reduced after his

appointment.24

63. The construction of Article 108, as well as the placement in the constitutional text, lucidly

manifest the effect of this provision. However, it would still serve us well to examine the

apparent purpose of this Article, so that we may ensure the full efficacy of its normative

force.

64. As the Attorney-General has repeatedly emphasised in several advisory correspondence

they have issued on request, salaries and pension entitlements of judges relate directly to

the independence of individual judges, and ipso facto to the independence of the judiciary

as an institution. This is made very clear within the constitutional text by placing Article

108 under the heading ‘Independence of the Judiciary’.

65. This topic of judicial independence is one of the first constitutional principles a student of

law gets exposed to. The solemn importance attached to the independence of the judicial

branch historically derives from Baron de Montesquieu’s conception of the separation of

powers, which evolved in its various forms to be a touchstone of constitutional

governance.

66. As Montesquieu cautioned in his celebrated work De l'esprit des lois [The Spirit of Laws],

“Again, there is no liberty, if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative

and executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject

would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator.

24 Emphasis added

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 27 of 78

Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and

oppression.”25

67. How we conceive the term ‘judicial independence’, or the strict legal meaning thereof, has

not remained stagnant over the years. Judicial independence, according to Anderson &

Helland,26 has at least two conceptual dimensions: Firstly, who should be independent? Is

it the judiciary in general, the specific court in general or the individual judge who hears

the case? Secondly, from whom should they be independent?27 The Montesquieuian

conception, as mentioned earlier, sees independence from the executive and legislative

branches of government as paramount. However, other forces such as public opinion,

litigants or even attorneys may potentially operate disruptively, more than ever in today’s

climate.

68. It is well understood that such independence must encompass both substantive and

compositional, applying not only to the judiciary as an institution but also to its individual

members. And it is axiomatic that such independence greatly depends in some shape or

form on the financial independence of individual judges. The salary and pension afforded

to the members of the judiciary, in my view, is one matter that impacts both these

dimensions of independence.

Salaries, Pension Entitlements, and the Independence of the Judiciary

69. There is no denying that Judges are expected to lead a significantly different life, both

personally and professionally, from that of other legal professionals. As Winston Churchill

once observed:

25 Baron de Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws (Thomas Nugent trans., 1752) at p. 173

26 James M Anderson & Eric Helland, ‘How Much Should Judges Be Paid? An Empirical Study on the Effect of Judicial Pay on the State Bench’ (2012) 64 Stanford Law Review 1277, at p. 1293

27 ibid, at p. 1293, fn 60

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 28 of 78

“A form of life and conduct far more severe and restricted than that of ordinary

people is required from judges and, though unwritten, has been most strictly

observed. They are at once privileged and restricted. They have to present a

continuous aspect of dignity and conduct…”28

70. Such restrictions on the life and conduct of a superior court judge do not end with their

tenure. The life of a retired judge must continue to uphold the sanctity of the office he or

she once held. Our Constitutional text itself is plenty clear on this.

71. As Article 110 of the Constitution provides:

“…

(2) No Judge of the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal shall perform any other office

(whether paid or not) or accept any place of profit or emolument, except as

authorized by the Constitution or by written law or with the written consent of

the President.

(3) No person who has held office as a permanent Judge of the Supreme Court or of

the Court of Appeal may appear, plead, act or practise in any court, tribunal or

institution as an Attorney-at-Law at any time without the written consent of the

President.”

72. As it is evident, the Constitution itself imposes restrictions on judges’ freedom of

occupation and profession. This, by extension, limits the sources from which such judges

may lawfully derive an income. Restrictions of this nature make it necessary that judges

be given a salary and pension that corresponds properly to the standing and dignity of

judicial office.

28 Robert Rhodes James (ed), 8 Winston S. Churchill: His Complete Speeches 1897-1963 (1974), at p. 8548

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 29 of 78

73. This is an issue that has received widespread attention. As I noted earlier, much of the

formal accounts and reports on concerns relating to judicial salaries come from the United

States.

74. It is apparent that this concern goes far back. In fact, one of the twenty-seven grievances

set out in the US Declaration of Independence (1776) was that “[George III] has made

Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and the Amount and

Payment of their Salaries.”

75. While the Articles of Confederation (1777) made no mention of the judicial branch,29

the 1787 Constitution Convention set out what is known as the ‘Compensation Clause’ in

Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution of the United States. It provides that,

“The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and

in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.

The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during

good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a

Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in

Office.”

76. Before settling on this provision, which prohibits diminution of judges’ salaries, draft

constitutions sought to prohibit both decreases and increases,30 so that judges are placed

beyond all forms of financial persuasions. The necessity of periodic increments was later

recognised, inflation being inevitable. James Madison had taken the view that judges

ought to be afforded a permanent, inflation-adjusted salary—secured against something

of permanent value—in order to better secure judicial independence, so that judicial

29 Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., ‘2024 Year End Report on the Federal Judiciary’ (December 31, 2024), at p. 2

30 Anderson & Helland (2012) supra note 26, at p. 1295

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 30 of 78

officers would not be tempted to curry favour with the legislature to see their pay

increased.31

77. As the US Supreme Court observed in United States v. Will et al.,32

“The Compensation Clause has its roots in the longstanding Anglo-American

tradition of an independent Judiciary. A Judiciary free from control by the

Executive and the Legislature is essential if there is a right to have claims decided by

judges who are free from potential domination by other branches of government…”

78. Anderson & Helland observe that the framers of the US Constitution were primarily

concerned with making the judicial branch independent from the executive and

legislative. However, the focus has later shifted to also pay attention to the relationship

between judicial independence and other financial interests or stakes a judge might have

in their own commercial ventures.33

79. In the US, debate on judicial pay and judicial independence has persisted since the days

of its founding fathers. In 2003, the Volcker Commission Report34 observed, regarding

judicial salaries in the US, as follows:

“The lag in judicial salaries has gone on too long, and the potential for diminished

quality in American jurisprudence is now too large. Too many of America’s best

lawyers have declined judicial appointments. Too many senior judges have sought

private sector employment—and compensation—rather than making the important

31 ibid at pp. 1295-1297

33 ibid at p. 1298

34 ‘Urgent Business for America: Revitalizing the Federal Government for the 21st Century’ (Report of the National Commission on the Public Service, January 2003), at p. 23

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 31 of 78

contributions we have long received from judges in senior status.

Unless this is revised soon, the American people will pay a high price for the low

salaries we impose on the men and women in whom we invest responsibility for the

dispensation of justice. We are not suggesting that we should pay judges at levels

comparable to those of the partners at our nation’s most prestigious law firms. Most

judges take special satisfaction in their work and in public service. The more

reasonable comparisons are with the leading academic centers and not-for-profit

institutions…”

80. As the Volcker Commission has recognised, where remuneration and pension benefits of

judges are inadequate, the best lawyers will continue to reject judicial appointments. Even

those who have accepted appointments will leave office for better prospects. In this sense,

as Chief Justice William Rehnquist comments, judicial salaries also affect the inclusivity

and diversity of the judicial branch.35

81. Late Chief Justice Rehnquist, perhaps the most outspoken out of those who canvassed for

better judicial salaries in the United States, habitually commented on the inexorable

impact of judicial salaries on the independence of the judiciary in his Year-End Reports.

82. In the 2002 Year-End Report, His Lordship observed as follows:

“Diminishing judicial salaries affects not only those who have become judges, but

also the pool of those willing to be considered for a position on the federal bench. I

am not suggesting that there is a shortage of lawyers lined up to apply for vacant

judgeships. But many of the very best lawyers, those with a great deal of experience,

are not willing to accept a position knowing that their salary will not even keep pace

with inflation. Our judges will not continue to represent the diverse face of America

35 Anderson & Helland (2012) supra note 26, at p. 1289

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 32 of 78

if only the well-to-do or the mediocre are willing to become judges.

…Those lawyers who are most qualified to serve as federal judges have opportunities

to earn far more in private law practice or business than as judges. I am not

suggesting that we match the pay of the private sector—but the large and growing

disparity must be decreased if we hope to continue to provide our nation a capable

and effective federal judicial system. Providing adequate compensation for judges is

basic to attracting and retaining experienced, well-qualified and diverse men and

women to perform a demanding position in the public service. We need judges from

different backgrounds and we want them to stay for life.”36

83. The learned Chief Justice’s successor, John G. Roberts, Jr., in the 2006 Year-End Report,

once again brought the concerns regarding the continued failure to raise judicial pay to

the fore, describing it as a “…constitutional crisis that threatens to undermine the strength

and independence of the federal judiciary.”37

84. As Chief Justice Roberts further observed in the said Report,

“The dramatic erosion of judicial compensation will inevitably result in a decline in

the quality of persons willing to accept a lifetime appointment as a federal judge.

Our judiciary will not properly serve its constitutional role if it is restricted to (1)

persons so wealthy that they can afford to be indifferent to the level of judicial

compensation, or (2) people for whom the judicial salary represents a pay increase.

Do not get me wrong–there are very good judges in both of those categories. But a

judiciary drawn more and more from only those categories would not be the sort of

36 Chief Justice Rehnquist ‘2002 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary’ (January 1, 2003) available at: https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/year-endreports.aspx

37 Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr, ‘2006 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary’ (January 1, 2007), at p. 1

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 33 of 78

judiciary on which we have historically depended to protect the rule of law in this

country.”38

85. Another danger seldom spoken of is how low pay, coupled with restrictions on other

employment, may potentially lead officials towards corruption. Where the workload is

near herculean, if the pay is derisory, it could understandably leave them open to being

enticed by unscrupulous bargains. It is also to be noted that judicial officers do not have

the option of resorting to industrial or union action, in order to vindicate any rights

relating to their wages.

86. As noted in the South African case of Van Rooyen and Others v The State and Others

(General Council of the Bar of South Africa Intervening),39

“Judicial officers ought not to be put in a position of having to do this, or to engage

in negotiations with the executive over their salaries. They are judicial officers, not

employees, and cannot and should not resort to industrial action to advance their

interests in their conditions of service. That makes them vulnerable to having less

attention paid to their legitimate concerns in relation to such matters, than others

who can advance their interest through normal bargaining processes open to them”

87. Another well-founded criticism of low pension entitlements is that it may lead judges to

appease authorities expecting lucrative post-retirement appointments. This would

especially be true if executive and legislative authorities are left free to adjust judicial

pensions on a whim. As US Chief Justice Roberts observed 2006 Year-End Report,

“…If judicial appointment ceases to be the capstone of a distinguished career and

instead becomes a stepping stone to a lucrative position in private practice, the

38 ibid at p. 7

39 2002 (8) BCLR 810 (CC)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 34 of 78

Framers‘ goal of a truly independent judiciary will be placed in serious jeopardy.”

88. In this regard, Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, PC observes as follows in his treatise

Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka:40

“Yet another way in which the prestige of the judiciary has been undermined is the

appointment of handpicked retired judges of the superior courts to positions in the

executive and its agencies. It is suggested that the Constitution should provide

that the pension of a retired judge of a superior court should be equivalent to

the salary of a sitting judge and that such a judge should not hold any office or be

appointed to any position to which he could not have been appointed if he had been

a judge…”

89. It is for such reasons that the reduction of salaries and pensions of judges is generally

frowned upon. I believe Alexander Hamilton explained it best, in Federalist No. 79: “Next

to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges

than a fixed provision for their support… In the general course of human nature, a power

over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over his will.”41

90. This is hardly a feature unique to our own Constitution or to that of the United States. It

is a universally accepted norm that is ubiquitous in constitutional texts as well as

international frameworks and guidelines.

91. International Bar Association’s Minimum Standards of Judicial Independence (Adopted

in 1982) provides in Articles 14 and 15 as follows:

40 Jayampathy Wickramaratne, Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka (Stamford Lake 2021) 118 (Emphasis added)

41 Alexander Hamilton, ‘Federalist No. 79: The Judiciary Continued’ (McLEAN's Edition, New York)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 35 of 78

“14 Judicial salaries and pensions shall be adequate and should be regularly

adjusted to account for price increases independent of executive control.

15

a) The position of the judges, their independence, their security, and their

adequate remuneration shall be secured by law.

b) Judicial salaries cannot be decreased during the judges’ services except as a

coherent part of an overall public economic measure.”

92. The Venice Commission remarked in its Report on the Independence of the Judicial

System, 42

“45. The CCJE [Consultative Council of European Judges] adds in Opinion No. 1:

“62. While some systems (e.g. in the Nordic countries) cater for the

situation by traditional mechanisms without formal legal provisions,

the CCJE considered that it was generally important (and especially so

in relation to the new democracies) to make specific legal provision

guaranteeing judicial salaries against reduction and to ensure at least

de facto provision for salary increases in line with the cost of living.”

46. The Venice Commission shares the opinion that the remuneration of judges has

to correspond to the dignity of the profession and that adequate remuneration is

indispensable to protect judges from undue outside interference…”

93. Commonwealth (Latimer House) Principles, under its guidelines for preserving judicial

independence, provides that,

“…Appropriate salaries and benefits, supporting staff, resources and equipment are

42 European Commission for Democracy Through Law (Venice Commission), ‘Report on the Independence of the Judicial System, Part 1: The Independence of Judges’, CDL-AD(2010)004 (Strasbourg 16 March 2010)

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 36 of 78

essential to the proper functioning of the judiciary.

As a matter of principle, judicial salaries and benefits should be set by an independent

body and their value should be maintained.”43

94. In addition, Principle 11 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the

Judiciary44 states that,

“The term of office of judges, their independence, security, adequate remuneration,

conditions of service, pensions and the age of retirement shall be adequately secured

by law.”

95. Numerous constitutions around the world have followed the same model as the

Compensation Clause in the United States Constitution. Article 110 of the National

Constitution of Argentina (1853), Section 72(iii) of the Commonwealth of Australia

Constitution Act (1901), Article 125 of the Constitution of India (1949), Article 79 of the

Constitution of Japan (1946), Article 94 of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican

States (1917), Section 176(3) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996),

Section 24 of the Constitution Act 1986 of New Zealand, Article VIII, Section 3 of the

Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines (1987) and Article 180 of the Political

Constitution of the State of Bolivia are some of the constitutional provisions that explicitly

prohibit any reductions to judicial salaries.

96. The 1980 Peruvian Constitution45 took a somewhat different approach by guaranteeing

43 ANNEX: PARLIAMENTARY SUPREMACY AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE - Latimer House Guidelines for the Commonwealth (19 June 1998) in Commonwealth Parliament Association, ‘Commonwealth (Latimer House) Principles on the Three Branches of Government’ (November 2003), Guideline II (2)

44 Adopted on 06th September 1985 by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 September 1985

45 Now replaced by the Political Constitution of the Republic of Peru (1993)

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 37 of 78

the judiciary a minimum percentage of the country’s budget.46 However, the present

Constitution of Peru, enacted in 1993, does not appear to contain a similar provision.

Article 213 of the Constitution of Panama (1972), on the other hand, declares that salaries

and allowances for Justices of the Supreme Court shall not be less than those of the

Ministers of State.

97. The connection between judicial salaries and the independence of the judiciary has also

been recognised by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Slovenia.47 The

Constitutional Court found that Article 125 of the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia

required the legislature to also provide a mechanism to prevent the reduction of judicial

salaries resulting from the ‘fall in their real value’. It is noteworthy to this end that, said

Article 125 of the Slovenian Constitution does not expressly prohibit the reduction of

judges’ salaries but rather merely provides that ‘the Judges shall independently exercise

their duties and functions in accordance with this Constitution and with the law’.48

98. It is amply clear, then, that this notion of irreducibility of judicial salaries is one of the more

widely utilised measures in protecting personal independence of judicial officers from

economic pressure. The drafters of our own Constitution have opted for the same

approach.

99. While most authorities I have adverted to mention of judicial salaries, the same naturally

extends to the pension entitlements of judges as well. As I mentioned earlier, a judge is

saddled with legal and ethical restrictions and limitations not only during their tenure but

also after their retirement. As such, their subsistence and livelihood must involve a degree

of certainty if individual judges are to be truly beyond external pressure. To this extent,

the pension entitlements of a Superior Court Judge constitute an extension of the

compensation awarded for past service, as well as for the lifelong restrictions to which the

Judge is subject.

100. There is, indeed, a general principle that the salaries of judges in general—not only the

Judges of Superior Courts—should not be reduced during their tenure of office.49

However, in addition to this general principle, an express constitutional guarantee is set

out vis-à-vis the Judges of Superior Courts, to better protect the independence of such

Judges. This is hardly surprising considering the nature of the matters that are generally

canvassed before the Superior Courts. As opposed to purely personal disputes, various

actions and applications against the State are taken up before Superior Court Judges on

a daily basis.

101. As Wanasundera, J opined in Hewamanne v. De Silvas and Another,50

"These constitutional provisions have established and constituted the Judiciary as

one of the three principal organs of the State and have also proceeded to ensure

the independence of the judiciary as its essential feature. The peculiar standing

and position of judges in our Constitution are very much similar to the position

of judges in the U.K. Sir Winston Churchill, in a speech made in the House of

Commons when the increase of the salaries of judges was being discussed in the

49 Re Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill S.C. S.D. Nos 64/2022 to 71/2022, at pp. 41-42

House, described with his characteristic eloquence the unique position the judges

occupy in the framework of government. The quotation is taken from a lecture

entitled "Independence and Impartiality of Judges" given by Lord Denning at the

Faculty of Law Witswatersrand University, S. Africa. and contained in S.A.L.J., page

349

‘There is nothing like them at all in our island. They are appointed for life.

They cannot be dismissed by the executive Government. They cannot be

dismissed by the Crown either by the Prerogative or on the advice of Ministers.

They have to interpret the law according to their learning and conscience.

They are distinguishable from the great officers of State and other

servants of the Executive, high or low, and from the leaders of

commerce and industry. They are also clearly distinguishable from the

holders of less exalted judicial office. Nothing but an address from both

Houses of Parliament, assented to by the Crown, can remove them.’

Sir Winston continued:

‘The principle of the complete independence of the Judiciary from the

Executive is the foundation of many things in our island life. It has been

widely imitated in varying degrees throughout the free world. It is perhaps

one of the deepest gulfs between us and all forms of totalitarian rule.

The only subordination which a judge knows in his judicial capacity is

that which he owes to the existing body of legal doctrine enunciated in

years past by his brethren on the bench, past and present, and upon the

laws passed by Parliament which have received the Royal assent. The judge

has not only to do justice between man and man. He also - and this is one of

his most important functions considered incomprehensible in some large

parts of the world - has to do justice between the citizens and the State . . .

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 40 of 78

The British Judiciary, with its traditions and record, is one of the greatest living

assets of our race and people and the independence of the Judiciary is a part

of our message to the ever-growing world which is rising so swiftly around

us.’” 51

102. It is very clear that, as this Court has recognised, time and time again, the sacrosanct

principle of judicial independence is a central norm embedded in our Constitution. It is

also clear that framers of our Constitution have deployed the widely accepted principle

of irreducibility of judicial salaries/pension entitlements as a key device to this end.

Judicial Independence and the Sovereignty of the People

103. As observed in Re Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill,52 this Court held in Re Industrial

Disputes (Special Provisions) Bill53 that Sovereignty in Article 3 of the Constitution must

be interpreted to include the right to an independent judiciary.

104. In Re Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill,54 this Court further opined that “[a]ny

Constitutional amendment to the retirement age or the period of office impacting on

incumbent judges, whether directly or indirectly, will impinge on the independence of

the judiciary and [be] violative of Article 3 which requires a Referendum.”55

105. The Petitioner contended that any amendment to the salaries and pension entitlements

would impinge on the independence of the judiciary and be violative of Article 3 read

with Article 108 of the Constitution, just as much as an amendment to the retirement age

or term of office would. Accordingly, it was the Petitioner’s submission that any reduction

to the pension and salary entitlements of judges would require a resolution in Parliament

passed by a two-thirds majority as well as a referendum.

106. This submission of the Petitioner is also supported by the Irish Constitutional experience.

In 2011, when Ireland attempted to reduce the salaries of Irish judges, the question had

to be placed before the people at a referendum. The decision to reduce the salaries was

then carried out, after being approved by a referendum on 27th October 2011.

107. Considering the decisions of this Court I have considered in the immediately preceding

section of this judgment and the views expressed therein, I am of the opinion that the

Petitioner's contention in this regard is well-founded. As I have already explained, salaries

and pension entitlements of judges directly relate to the independence of the judiciary,

and the independence of the judiciary is a matter so clearly embedded in Articles 3 and 4

of the Constitution, for the Rule of Law itself pre-supposes an independent judiciary.

108. As Sharvananda, J (as His Lordship then was) very aptly observed in Visuvalingam v.

Liyanage,56

"The main aspirations of the Constitution are set down in its luminous preamble.

Rule of law is the foundation of the Constitution and independence of the judiciary

and fundamental human rights are basic and essential features of the Constitution.

It is a lesson of history that the most valued constitutional rights pre-suppose

an independent judiciary, through which alone they can be vindicated. There

can be no free society without law, administered through an independent

judiciary. It is and should be the pride of a democratic government that it

maintains and upholds independent courts of justice where even its own acts

56 [1983] 1 Sri L.R. 203

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 42 of 78

can be tested. The supremacy of the Constitution is protected by the authority

of an independent judiciary to act as the interpreter of the Constitution. So

solicitous were the framers of the Constitution to make the position of the Judges

independent and entrenched that they invested them with the status of irremovability

save on the limited grounds and manner specifically set out in its provisions. The

Judges of the Supreme Court and of the Court of Appeal, unlike Public Officers

of whatever rank, do not hold office during pleasure. The Constitution

endeavours to secure the independence of the judiciary by setting up well-known

mechanisms to assure their security of tenure. The vital need of security of tenure

can scarcely be over-emphasised. It is significant that the Article 107 appears under

the caption "Independence of the Judiciary.

Article 108 provides that their salaries shall be determined by Parliament and are

charged on to the Consolidated Fund and that the salary payable to and pension

entitlement of a Judge of the said Courts shall not be reduced after his appointment.

It is manifest that these provisions are designed to safeguard the

independence of the Judges by affording them security of tenure. These

provisions have not been put into the Constitution merely for the individual

benefit of the Judges; they have been put there as a matter of public policy.

The security of tenure of Judges has been vouched to the Judges, not only for their

own protection but for the protection of the State itself. The framers of the

Constitution had considered it to be in the interest of the public and not merely of

the individual Judges that their security of tenure should be sacrosanct and

sanctioned by the Constitution.57

Cabinet Memorandum dated 24th June 2019

109. The aforesaid Memorandum dated 24th June 201958 sought the approval of the Cabinet

of Minister to (i) to recover the commuted pension paid to the Judges of the Superior

Courts in 120 months in accordance with the laws in force, and (ii) to present a resolution

to the parliament in that regard.

110. Said Memorandum first sets out the background of the issue, highlighting that commuted

pension paid to the Superior Court Judges amounting to 24 times their monthly pension

were not deducted from their monthly pension for a long period of time and that said

Judges had accordingly been paid an unreduced monthly pension. It categorically states

that there had been no legal basis for this purpose. While it also highlights the audit queries

by the Auditor-General and the subsequent inquiry by Parliaments Committee on Public

Accounts (COPA), it makes no mention of the opinions given by the Attorney-General up

to that point in time as to why such a deduction should not be made according to Article

108(2) of the Constitution.

111. It highlights that there had been requests from Superior Court Judges to not make such

deductions, as well as to effect increments to their salaries, and further explains the steps

taken to increase the allowances of the judges.

112. While the Memorandum also makes reference to Article 108 of the Constitution and its

effect in general, the opinion of the Attorney-General with respect to how this

constitutional provision operates is not duly set out. Instead, the Memorandum simply

states that,

“… the Honourable Attorney General has pointed out that the powers relating to the

reduction of pensions of the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal or

58 Marked ‘27R20’, appended to 27th Respondent’s Statement of Objections

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 44 of 78

matters incidental thereto has [sic] been conferred on Parliament by the

Constitution.”

113. The Memorandum makes no mention of when this opinion was given and how it was

communicated. Therefore, it is unclear whether the Attorney-General has in fact given

such an opinion. Be that as it may, the above statement is not a mere misinterpretation,

but a complete and utter misrepresentation of the constitutional provisions, as it contains

a position that is precisely the opposite of what the Constitution states.

114. Following the said error, the Memorandum further states,

“…I observe that the recovery of the commuted pension would not affect the

interpretation of the Article 108(2) of the Constitution”

115. I would be remiss if I fail to point out at this stage that sole and exclusive jurisdiction to

interpret the Constitution is vested with the Supreme Court by Article 125 of the

Constitution. The then President has acted in contravention of this provision by forming

an opinion on the interpretation of Article 108(2) and thereafter taking affirmative action

based on such opinion. What is even more striking is that this course of action was

pursued despite the explicit advice given by the Attorney-General, the principal legal

advisor to the State, to the contrary.

116. The Memorandum further states as follows:

“I observe that it is not appropriate to grant a non-recoverable allowance to any

person of whatever rank out of public funds and that if this allowance is granted to

the Judges of Superior Courts whose salaries are met out of the Consolidated Fund,

it will be a precedent for the entire public service to make similar requests for this

allowance resulting in the government having to meet an additional commitment.”

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 45 of 78

117. This apprehension, I am inclined to observe, is fundamentally misplaced. The protection

specifically afforded to the Judges of Superior Courts by Article 108(2) of the Constitution

is not applicable to the entire public service. As I explained above in detail, the provision

affords this special protection to judicial officers to prevent other organs of government

from potentially utilising judicial salaries as a ‘bargaining chip’ as it were. To this extent,

judicial officers constitute a special class of officers, and Superior Court Judges are a

distinct class within this special class of officers. As previously noted, many restrictions are

imposed on the Judges of Superior Courts by the Constitution itself, both during and after

their tenure—restrictions that do not apply for other public officers. Understandably, such

unique restrictions are coupled with a distinctive set of protections and benefits.

118. As K. Ramamoorthy, J opined in R.N. Mittal & Anr v. Government of the NCT of Delhi,59

“Society, therefore, must understand the problem. Solution to the problem would

depend upon realisation of the fact that the more capable people at the Bar are not

willing to accept offers of judicial appointments. The plea that the other wings in the

States would demand improvement in their scales or pay is not a relevant feature at

all when the problem is viewed from this angle. We hope and trust that society

would generate the appropriate understanding of the matter and no

Government would come forward to take the stand that if the pay scales and

perks of the Judicial Officers are improved similar demands would come from

other wings of Government.”

119. The aforementioned distinction between judicial officers and public officers is one clearly

recognized in our Constitution. Article 170 of the Constitution expressly sets out two

distinct definitions for the terms ‘judicial officer’ and ‘public officer’ for the purpose of the

59 R.N. Mittal (Mr. Justice) (Retd.) & Anr v. Government of the Nct of Delhi, 1999 III AD (DELHI) 297, 78 (1999) DLT 849, 1999 (49) DRJ 532, at para 8 with reference to All India Judges’ Association v. Union of India & Ors. JT 1991 (4) SC 285, at para 50

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 46 of 78

Constitution. Moreover, the definition of ‘pubic officer’ therein60 clearly excludes judicial

officers from its ambit.

120. This distinction is also very clearly recognised in many other jurisdictions.61 As observed

in All India Judges’ Association v. Union of India and Others,62

“…The judicial service is not service in the sense of 'employment'. The judges are not:

employees. As members of the judiciary, they exercise the sovereign judicial power of

the State. They are holders of public offices in the same way as the members of the

council of ministers and the members of the legislature.”

121. On top of all such errors on the facts and law, as I noted previously, said Memorandum

does not place before the Cabinet all material documents required to be taken into

consideration to make a decision, including the several opinions given by the Attorney-

General. As the Respondent admitted before this Court, said documents were only

submitted to the Cabinet in December 2023.

122. It in this context that the Cabinet has granted approval to both proposals set out in this

Memorandum by Decision dated 24th July 2019.

Cabinet Memorandum dated 14th December 2023

123. By Memorandum dated 14th December 2023, then President Ranil Wickremasinghe has

placed before the Cabinet a more complete picture of the sequence of event leading to

60 As amended by the Twenty First Amendment to the Constitution

61 Gilham (Appellant) v. Ministry of Justice (Respondent) [2019] UKSC 44; Van Rooyen and Others v.

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 47 of 78

the instant fundamental rights application as well as the proceedings before this Court up

to that stage. This Memorandum, inter alia, states the following:

“….

1.7 With the cancellation of the Public Administration Circular No.44/90, the

privilege of receiving a pension calculated on the basis of 90% of the salary and the

commuted gratuity which was not recovered from the pension ceased with effect

from 1996-12-24. The Secretary to the then Ministry of Public Administration had

sought the opinion of the Attorney General on inquiry made by the Registrar of the

Supreme Court pertaining to the pension of Justice P. Ramanathan, retired judge of

the Supreme Court, being calculated on the basis of 85% of the salary in keeping

with the provisions which prevailed prior to 1990-10-18. The Attorney General by his

letter dated 1997-09-15 has intimated that, even though the pension entitlement of

a Judge of the Superior Courts could be increased at any time after his appointment,

varying or altering which has the effect of reducing such entitlement once it is

increased, contravenes Article 108(2) of the Constitution. Accordingly, it has been

informed that the relevant retired Judge should be awarded a pension calculated on

the basis of 90% of the salary under the cancelled Public Administration Circular

No.44/90.

1.8 Accordingly, action had been taken as per the advice of the Attorney General, to

pay the retired Judges of the Supreme Courts, an un-reduced pension of 90% of the

salary together with a commuted gratuity continuously, which is not recovered. But,

no provisions to that effect have been included in the Minutes on Pensions.

1.9 To regularise this situation, section 25 of the Minutes on Pensions has been

repealed by the Gazette Notification No.1190/18 dated 2021-06-28 and a new

section incorporated therefor in terms of which, a Judge of the Supreme Court or

Court of Appeal retiring with 36 months service as a Judge of the Supreme Court or

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 48 of 78

a Judge of the Court of Appeal or in both positions, is entitled to receive a pension

calculated on the basis of 90% of his/her last drawn salary at retirement. Public

Officers and judicial officers are not entitled to this privilege.

1.10 But in parallel to this amendment, the applicability of the provisions of in section

‘2A’ and ‘2B’ of the Minutes on Pensions to receive the commuted gratuity and death

gratuity pertaining to the Judges of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal, have

been removed. This has removed the entitlement of obtaining the commuted gratuity

at the time of retirement or the death gratuity in the event of death while on duty,

for Judges of the Supreme Court.

1.11 In the above backdrop, although the Minutes on Pensions does not contain a

legal authority or a provision for the Director General of Pensions to pay the

commuted gratuity and the death gratuity to the Judges of the Superior Courts,

payments have been continuously made to date, based on the advice of the Attorney

General referred to at 1.7 above and it has not been recovered from the pension.

Further, the applicability of the said advice of the Attorney General in respect of the

Judges of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal who have been appointed after

1996-12-24, is problematic.

1.14 Justice A.H.M. Upaly Abeyrathne, former Judge of the Supreme Court, has retired

on 2017-08-07 on completion of 65 years of age has filed a Fundamental Rights

Application bearing No. SC(FR)282/2018 in the Supreme Court on 2018-09-10 citing

the Director General of Pensions, Auditor General and Attorney General as

Respondents, challenging the recovery of commuted gratuity that he obtained on his

option and payment of the relevant installment deducted pension.

1.15 The former President, pursuing action as per the legal advice pertaining to this

Petition bearing no. SC(FR)282/2018, submitted the Cabinet Memorandum dated

2019-06-24 and No.19/1782/101/116. Since the recovery of commuted gratuity

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 49 of 78

which is a recoverable advance, obtained on their option and the payment of the

relevant installment deducted pension up to 10 years could not be treated as a

reduction in pension entitlement as specified in Article 108(2) of the Constitution, the

Cabinet at its meeting held on 2019-07-19 has granted approval for the recovery of

the commuted gratuity of the Judges of the Superior Courts in 120 months in

accordance with existing law.

Further, approval has also been granted to move a Resolution in Parliament to that

effect. Accordingly, this proposal had been included in the Order Paper of the

Parliament dated 2019-11-11. However, the Resolution did not receive

Parliamentary approval as it was not debated and due to the prorogation of

Parliament.

1.16 Since permission has been granted, on the request of the Petitioner, to cite the

Cabinet of Ministers too as Respondents and due to the Attorney General inquiring

from the Secretary to the Cabinet whether the Petitioner could be granted any

administrative relief, the Secretary to the Cabinet drew the attention of the Cabinet

to this matter through the Note to the Cabinet dated 2020-11-12 on CP

No.20/1822/340/006. The Cabinet having considered this matter at the cabinet

meeting held on 2020-11-16 has re-confirmed the decision taken at its meeting held

on 2019-07-19 in this regard.

1.17 The Petition of the Supreme Court Case No. SC(FR)282/2018 has been further

amended on 2023-09-27, wherein the Cabinet of Ministers, the Registrar of the

Supreme Court and the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs,

Provincial Council and Local Government too have been cited as Respondents….”63

124. As can be seen, the said Memorandum sets out the following key observations:

o Opinions received from the Attorney-General intimates that retired judges should

be awarded an unreduced pension calculated on the basis of 90% of the salary in

terms of the cancelled PA Circular No. 44/90;

o Judges of Superior Courts have accordingly been paid an unreduced pension for a

long period of time pursuant to such advice from the Attorney-General;

o An administrative shortcoming has occurred when amending Section 25 of the

Minutes on Pension by Gazette Notification No. 1190/18 dated 28th June 2001,

which had the effect of inadvertently removing the applicability of Sections 2A and

2B of the said Minutes which provided for the ‘commuted gratuity’ and death

gratuity of Superior Court Judges;

o The above removal contravenes Article 108(2) of the Constitution;

o In spite of the abovesaid removal, ‘commuted gratuity’ had been paid to the

Judges of Superior Courts up to 2017, even in the absence of specific provisions in

the Minutes on Pensions;

o Steps have been taken to recover the commuted pension from such Judges in 120

months from the year 2017 through the payment of a reduced pension;

o Minutes on Pension ought to be amended to rectify this longstanding

administrative shortcoming and regularize the payment of death gratuity and

‘commuted gratuity’;

o It would be appropriate to pursue action according to the policy at the time to

recover the ‘commuted gratuity’ granted as an advance recoverable from all public

officers, including Superior Court Judges;

125. Somewhat significantly, the Memorandum further observes that “[n]on-recovery of the

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 51 of 78

commuted gratuity from the Judges of the Superior Courts would tantamount to granting a

new pension entitlement to such retired Judges…” and forewarns that such non-recovery

could potentially lead to issues regarding the recovery of property loans, vehicle loans,

etc., while also giving reasons for other public officers to demand similar benefit.

126. The above concern is reflected in the Cabinet Memorandum dated 24th June 2019 as well,

which I have adverted to under the immediate subheading hereinabove. I have discussed

why other public officers would not be entitled to a similar benefit, and do not wish to

repeat the same reasoning once again.

127. As to the other concerns, the non-recovery of commuted pension does indeed

tantamount to granting a new pension entitlement. This is precisely why Article 108(2) of

the Constitution prevents the same from being removed. In actual fact, the Judges were

paid the full pension without any deductions even when they have opted to receive a

commuted pension, according to the Public Administration Circular No. 44/90. Even after

the cancellation of the said Circular, the fully payment had continued in practice. It is

entirely erroneous to claim that this continuation lacks a legal basis, when the Attorney-

General has repeatedly explained the legal basis with reference to Article 108 of the

Constitution in several advisory opinions.

128. It is also entirely incorrect to suggest that non recovery of the commuted pension could

potentially cause trouble with respect to the recovery of personal loan, etc. The effect of

Article 108(2) of the Constitution is such that, once a salary or pension benefit is granted

to a Judge referred therein, after such person’s appointment as a Judge, the salary of

pension benefits so granted cannot be taken away. Salary and pension benefits of

Superior Court Judges can only be increased, and never reduced. This provision by no

means places such Judges beyond the reach of their creditors, nor does it absolve their

debts or other such obligations. To even suggest so would be manifestly absurd.

Failure to Place All Material Documents Before the Cabinet

129. As the Respondents submitted, it is consequent to a clarification sought by the Attorney-

General that the Ministry had, by letters dated 17th Match 2023 and 21st December 2023,

brought to the notice of Hon. Attorney-General the material documents, that disclosed

the reasons as to why the full pension was paid to Judges of the Superior Courts without

any deductions.

130. Thereafter, the Respondents, by motion dated 24th March 2023, disclosed said documents

to this Court as well as to the Petitioner. Thereafter, the same documents have been

placed before the Cabinet of Ministers by the former President by the aforementioned

Cabinet Memorandum dated 14th December 2023. Thereafter, the Cabinet had decided

on 18th December 2023 to appoint a Cabinet Sub-Committee and an Official’s Committee

to provide recommendations to the Cabinet.

131. Accordingly, it is amply clear that all cabinet decisions taken in this regard prior to this

Memorandum dated 14th December 2023 have been made without considering vital

material relating to the pension entitlements of Superior Court Judges.

Advice Sought from the Attorney-General in 2023 [Attorney-General’s Third

Opinion, dated 11th January 2024]

132. The Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers, by letter dated 29th November 2023, had sought

advice from the Attorney-General on the same matter with specific reference to the

instant fundamental rights application. The Attorney-General, by a response letter dated

11th January 2024, had sent his opinion to the said Secretary.64

64 Marked ‘T’, appended to the Motion dated 19th June 2025

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 53 of 78

133. In this response, at the very outset, then Attorney-General, Sanjay Rajaratnam, PC has

emphasised the fact that this matter related to the independence of the judiciary. Having

so emphasised, the Hon. Attorney-General has reiterated the advice given by the

abovementioned First and Second Opinions in 1997 and 2017.

134. The Attorney-General has specifically stated in his opinion that recovering commuted

pensions from judges under Gazette No. 981 of 19th June 1997 would be inconsistent with

Article 108(2) of the Constitution. He has further noted that such inconsistencies had

previously been avoided through the application of Circular No. 44/90 of 18th October

1990 with respect to the pensions of Superior Court Judges.

135. The Attorney-General has also made observations therein with regard to the Audit Query

dated 16th February 2015, by which the Auditor-General’s Department sought

clarifications from the Department of Pensions as to why commuted pension paid to the

pensions of Superior Court Judges were not deducted from their pensions.

136. However, the Department of Pensions had failed to set out the reasons with reference to

the foregoing series of events in its reply to the Auditor-General. As I previously noted,

the Director-General of Pensions admitted this fact in his Statement of Objections, which

was tendered by way of an affidavit.

137. The Attorney-General also observes that the Director General of Pensions had also failed

to furnish a full and complete statement of facts—including aforementioned circulars,

advice given by the Attorney-General, and letters from the said Director-General and

Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration—to the Audit and Management

Committee Meeting of the said Ministry as well as to the Parliaments Committee on Public

Accounts (COPA).

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 54 of 78

138. Moreover, and very crucially, the Attorney-General further observe that aforementioned

facts had not been fully disclosed to the Cabinet of Ministers at the time of making

decisions dated 19th July 2019 and 16th November 2020, despite such matters being within

the knowledge of the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration.

139. Having made the abovementioned observations, the Attorney-General concludes his

opinion dated 11th January 2024 as follows:

“In the light of the aforementioned facts, and those that were disclosed to my

Department by the Secretary to the said Ministry, I am of the opinion that the decision

and steps taken at the said Management Audit Committee Meeting on 28.06.2016

and the steps taken by the Director General of Pensions thereon viz. commencing

with the former Chief Justice Hon. K. Sripavan upon his retirement on 01.03.2017

and the other Judges of the Superior Courts thereafter, amounts to a reduction of

their pension benefits that such Judges were eligible to at the time of their

appointment. Such decision and the reductions [are] prohibited by Article 108(2) of

the Constitution in as much as such the decision’s failure to consider the relevant

material facts, makes the decision and steps arbitrary and irrational thus violating

Article 12(1) of the Constitution.65

140. Attorney-General has once again sent a letter containing his opinion and

recommendations to the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers, following a letter dated

11th January 2024 from the said Secretary. This letter, too, inter alia, reiterates the above

position, and I have adverted to the said letter [Attorney-General’s Fourth Opinion]

morefully hereinbelow.

Attorney-General’s Observations and Recommendations to the Cabinet

Memorandum dated 14th December 2023 [Attorney-General’s Fourth Opinion,

dated 01st March 2024]

141. In this letter dated 01st March 2024, countersigned by then Attorney-General, Sanjay

Rajaratnam, PC, the Attorney-General’s Department has provided an opinion and made

recommendations to the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers regarding Proposals No.

3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in the Cabinet Memorandum dated 14th December 2023.

142. Aforementioned proposals are as follows:

“3.1 To amend section 25 of the Minutes on Pensions regularizing the granting of

commuted gratuity and the death gratuity for the Judges of the Superior Courts

in keeping with the current circulars on salaries and allowances.

3.2 To recover the commuted gratuity obtained by Judges of the Superior Courts at

their option as resumed since the year 2017, without prejudice to the pension

benefits paid with effect from 1990-10-18, in 120 months as per the provisions of

the Minutes on Pensions and to pay the reduced monthly pension during the said

period.

3.3 To explore the possibility of making provisions through a separate law pertaining

to the pension entitlements and benefits and matters connected thereto of the

Judges of the Superior Courts.”

143. By this advice, the Attorney-General, reiterates the opinions given in the previous three

occasions. It states, inter alia, that:

o The decision taken in 1997 was to continue the application of PA Circular No. 44/90

of 18th October 1990 to the Judges of Superior Courts;

o The above decision was given effect to, starting from Hon. Ramanathan, J. and

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 56 of 78

continued even after the Gazette No. 1190/18 of 28th June 2001 was promulgated;

o There was no legal basis to resume the recovery of commuted pension in 2017 in

the first place;

o The decision to effect such recovery was made by persons who are not empowered

by law to make such decisions (as the decisions were not made by Parliament),

thus violating Article 108(1) of the Constitution;

o As such recoveries were effected in respect of Judges of Superior Courts after their

appointment, such recoveries violate Article 108(2) of the Constitution;

o The decisions to recover and the recovery of commuted pension from Judges of

Superior Courts from 2017 are ultra vires, illegal, irrational, void in law, and are

violative of Article 108(1), 108(2) and 12(1) of the Constitution.

144. The Attorney-General also highlights that the said material facts have not been disclosed

to the Cabinet of Ministers by the two Cabinet Memoranda in 2019, thus compromising

the validity of the two Cabinet Decisions taken pursuant to such Memoranda.

145. It is further noted therein that, if Gazette No. 1190/18 dated 28th June 2001 has not been

accurately drafted, the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration or the Director

General of Pensions ought to have taken immediate steps to rectify the same. Having said

so, the Attorney-General advices against any future amendment to further perpetuate

such inaccuracies, and recommends that Section 25 to the Minutes on Pension be

amended to regularise the same in accordance with Public Administration Circular No.

44/90 dated 18th October 1990.

146. Following such observations, the Attorney-General had advised against the proposals set

out in the aforementioned Cabinet Memorandum.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 57 of 78

Attorney-General’s Observations dated 06th September 2024 – Addendum to the

Report of the Officials’ Committee [Attorney-General’s Fifth Opinion]

147. As I previously noted, following the Cabinet Memorandum dated 14th December 2023 by

the President, by Cabinet Decision dated 18th December 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers

have formed a Cabinet Sub-Committee, chaired by the Minister of Justice, to consider and

make recommendations regarding the matters relating to the instant case.

148. Additionally, by the same Cabinet Decision, an Officials’ Committee was appointed to

assist the Cabinet Sub-Committee. However, the members of the Officials’ Committee had

failed to reach a unanimous decision. Accordingly, the Officials’ Committee had submitted

two separate set of observations and recommendations to the Sub-Committee, reflecting

the differences of opinion.

149. While the Attorney-General has given one opinion as an Addendum to the Officials’

Committee Report, all other members of the Officials’ Committee have given a different

opinion, with their own set of recommendations. The Attorney-General has recommended

against the implementation of proposals No. 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in the Cabinet Memorandum

dated 14th December 2023, highlighting that such implementation would, inter alia,

contravene Articles 108(1), 108(2) and 12(1) of the Constitution.

150. I do not see it necessary to set out the reasonings of the two factions in detail. The said

opinion of the Attorney-General [in the Addendum to the Report] is entirely consistent

with all four opinions I have already adverted to. The opinion of the other members run

completely contrary to that of the Attorney-General, recommending the implementation

of all proposals.

Conclusion of the Cabinet Appointed Sub-Committee in Its 2025 Report and

Associated Concerns

151. The Report of this Sub-Committee was made available before this Court by the learned

Deputy Solicitor General, maintaining the highest traditions of the Attorney-General’s

Department. The contents of this Sub-Committee’s Report, for it was prepared with

special reference to the matters before us, warrant special consideration.

152. The Cabinet Sub-Committee has come to make the following observations, having

referred to the cobweb of circulars, memoranda, and cabinet decisions, which I do not

wish to repeat, for that would make this judgment awfully repetitive—if it is not so already.

153. The Report clearly reveals that this Cabinet Appointed Sub-Committee was of the view

that the aforementioned Public Administration Circular No. 44/90 dated 18th October

1990 was implemented with the aim of encouraging public officials to retire at the age of

55 without seeking an extension of service. They opine in this Report that this benefit

should not have been extended to the judges of the Superior Courts.

154. Be that as it may, the reality is that the said benefit was in fact given to Judges of the

Superior Courts for many years. Had there been an error in this regard, as has been

repeatedly emphasised in several of the opinions given by the Attorney-General, the

relevant authorities ought to have taken immediate steps to rectify the same, instead of

attempting to act after nearly 27 years with retrospective effect.

155. The Committee has also formed an opinion to the effect that there is no legality in

granting such a commuted pension to Judges of the Superior Courts and that relevant

provisions need to be “amended to obtain legality in giving a recoverable commuted

pension to Judicial officers of the Superior courts as the entitlement given in Section 25 has

been repealed by the Gazette Notification No. 1190/18 dated 28.06.2001.” The Committee

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 59 of 78

has also taken notice of the fact that a commuted pension has nonetheless been given to

judicial officers.

156. Moreover, the Committee has made the following observations regarding the

applicability of Article 108 of the Constitution:

“This does not appear to be a violation of Art. 108(2) as this is given as a Commuted

Pension upon the agreement and the discretion of the pensioner. Therefore, this is

similar to obtain of a loan. Once a loan has been applied it will get deducted from

the applicant’s salary as agreed by the applicant at the time of application. The only

difference we see is that the commuted pension is not getting fully recovered and

there is no interest payment as well. Therefore, it appears that the commuted pension

has been given as a recoverable benefit.

Moreover, to become a violation of Art. 108(2) of the Constitution, the reduction

should have to be necessarily, which should be in existence at the time of the

appointment. In the given case, there was not such an entitlement provided by law

at the time of the appointment of the Petitioner. Hence, there cannot be any

legitimate expectation of getting and unrecoverable commuted pension while there

is no legality in giving such a commuted pension to superior court Judges due to the

amendment of Section 25 of the pension minutes.”66

157. Although the Attorney-General has repeatedly advice that such action would violate

Article 108(2) of the Constitution, the Sub-Committee has simply disregarded this opinion,

stating that said opinion of the Attorney-General was specific to the situation of Justice

Ramanathan. This, I must point out, is clearly erroneous. Only the very first advice given

by the Attorney-General in 1997 relate to the pension benefits of Justice Ramanathan.

66 Reproduced verbatim

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 60 of 78

158. The Attorney-General has given further advice regarding this matter in four other separate

instances—three of which are in fact attached to the Report of the Cabinet Sub-

Committee. Attorney-General’s Third Opinion dated 11th January 2024, which is directly

addressed to the Secretary of the Cabinet, explicitly states as follows: “the advice sought

by the Director General of Pension’s said letter dated 14.07.2017, is the same in respect of

which my Department had previously provided advice by letter dated 15.09.1997…”67 From

this statement, the Attorney-General has made it amply clear that the advice given with

respect to the pension entitlements of late Justice Ramanathan is applicable to all Judges

of the Superior Courts.

159. In addition to this, the Sub-Committee has also ventured to interpret the Constitution in

contravention of Article 125 of the Constitution. Quite apart from forming an opinion and

giving advice as to how a constitutional provision apply, to organise and set up day-to-

day administrative affairs and for such other purposes, the Sub-Committee has gone on

to interpret provisions in the Constitution, in complete disregard of the opinions given by

the chief legal advisor to the State as to how the relevant Articles of the Constitution

ought to be interpreted.

160. It is important to note that, where there is a question relating to the interpretation of a

Constitutional provision, it is only the Supreme Court that is empowered by the

Constitution to resolve such questions.68 No other authority, howsoever highly placed on

the political ladder, has jurisdiction under the Constitution to answer any question of

Constitutional interpretation.

67 Attorney-General’s letter addressed to the Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers dated 11th January 2024, para (q)

68 vide Article 125(1) of the Constitution

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 61 of 78

161. What is more disturbing is that this constitutional interpretation was given by the Sub-

Committee in relation to a matter that is currently sub judice, in addition to the

interpretation itself being manifestly ill-conceived.

162. The view taken by the Sub-Committee to the effect that “to become a violation of Art.

108(2) of the Constitution, the reduction should have to be necessarily, which should be in

existence at the time of the appointment [sic]” is completely antithetical to Article 108(2)

of the Constitution, and manifestly so.

163. Article 108(2) does not state that salary payable to and pension benefits in existence at

the time of appointment of a judge shall not be reduced. What it states is that the “salary

payable to, and the pension entitlement of” a Superior Court Judge “shall not be reduced

after appointment”. This simply means that, subsequent to one’s appointment as a

Superior Court Judge, his or her salary and pension entitlement should never decrease.

164. I wish to also observe at this stage that, in my view, there is no illegality, unlawfulness

and/or impropriety in granting the commuted pension to Judges of Superior Courts even

after aforementioned Gazette No. 1190/18 dated 28th June 2001. When PA Circular No.

44/90 dated 18th October 1990 was implemented, all public officers were given the benefit

of receiving a commuted pension and it was not deducted from the monthly pension

thereafter. This was also extended to judicial officers—whatever the policy consideration

may have been at the time, that is how this Circular was implemented. Thereafter, when

said Circular No. 44/90 was cancelled, Article 108 of the Constitution operated so as to

preserve the application of the said Circular with respect to Superior Court Judges, for a

mere Gazette cannot supress or negate the effect of a provision of the Constitution.

Accordingly, for all intents and purposes, the pension benefits given in the said Circular

No. 44/90 are still in force with respect to Superior Court Judges.

Cabinet Decision Dated 17th June 2025 Pursuant to the Cabinet Sub-Committee

Report

165. The aforementioned Report of the Cabinet Appointed Sub-Committee, with its

recommendations, had then been placed before the Cabinet of Ministers along with the

Note to the Cabinet dated 23rd May 2025 by the Minister of Justice and National

Integration.

166. The Sub-Committee has made six recommendations to the Cabinet, including, to recover

the commuted pension within the existing framework, to make a separate law regarding

the pension entitlements of Judges and amending Section 25 of the Minutes on Pension

to provide for the granting of comminuted pension to judicial officers and to recover the

same from the monthly pension.

167. The Cabinet of Ministers has accordingly decided to approve all six of the said

recommendations, and to inform the Attorney-General regarding this policy decision so

that this Court may be kept informed in the course of instant fundamental rights

application. The Cabinet has further decided to implement such recommendations

adhering to the judgment of this Court in the instant application.

Legitimate Expectation of the Judges

168. It was also contended that decisions and steps taken to recover the commuted pension

violated the Petitioner’s legitimate expectation to continue receiving the pension benefit

granted by Public Administration Circular 44/90 and that such benefit, which was available

to Judges of Superior Courts until 2017, would not be taken away after his appointment

to the Court of Appeal in 2008.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 63 of 78

169. As Dr. Bandaranayake, CJ observed in Siriwardana v. Seneviratne and 4 Others,69

“The term, now known as legitimate expectation, was first used by Lord Denning, in

Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs [(1969) 1 All ER 904]. The Court,

referring to a decision of the government to reduce the period already allowed to an

alien to enter and stay in England, had held that the person had a legitimate

expectation to stay in England that cannot be violated without following a

reasonable procedure. This was immediately followed in Breen v. Amalgamated

Engineering Union [(1971) 1 All ER 1 148] …

…The meaning and scope of the doctrine of legitimate expectation was considered at

length in Union of lndia v Hindustan Development Corporation [(1933) 3 SCC 499]

where it was clearly stated that:

“Time is a three-fold present: the present as we experience it, the past as

present memory and future as a present expectation. For legal purpose, the

expectation cannot be the same as anticipation. It is different from a wish, a

desire or a hope nor can it amount to a claim or demand on the ground of a

right. however earnest and sincere a wish, a desire or a hope may be and

however confidently one may look to them to be fulfilled, they by themselves

cannot amount to an assertable expectation and a mere disappointment does

not attract legal consequences. A pious hope cannot amount to a legitimate

expectation. the legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is

founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure

followed in a natural and regular sequence. Again, it is distinguishable from

a mere expectation. Such expectation should be justifiable legitimate and

protectable. Every such legitimate expectation does not by itself fructify into a

69 [2011] 2 Sri L.R. 1

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 64 of 78

right and, therefore, it does not amount to a right in a conventional sense.”

A careful consideration of the doctrine of legitimate expectation, clearly shows that,

whether an expectation is legitimate or not is a question of fact…”70

170. Dr. Sunil Coorey, in Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka,71 with reference to

numerous judgments of this Court and the Court of Appeal observes as follows:

“The unreasonable disregard of a “legitimate expectation” of “reasonable expectation

of a party has recently been identified as a particular instance of the exercise of power

being invalid for adopting a policy which no reasonable man would adopt. The

unreasonable disregard of the Petitioner’s “legitimate expectation” in the exercise of

discretionary power has been held to be one of the reasons why such exercise of

power must be held to be invalid.

“The doctrine of legitimate expectation is not limited to cases involving a legitimate

expectation of a hearing before some right or expectation was affected, but is also

extended to situations even where no right to be heard was available or existed but

fairness required a public body or official to act in compliance with its public

undertaking or assurance.” “The doctrine of inconsistency or of legitimate

expectation prohibits decisions being taken which confounds or disappoints an

expectation which an official or other authority or person has engendered in some

individual except, perhaps, where some countervailing facet of the public interest so

requires—this being judged in the light of the harm being done to the applicant.”

171. As morefully described earlier in the judgment, Public Administration Circular 44/90 dated

18th October 1990 introduced a new pension benefit to public officers, whereby there

70 ibid at p. 6-8

71 Sunil F.A. Coorey, Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka (4 edn, 2020) Vol. I, at p. 457-458

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 65 of 78

were able to obtain a commuted pension upon retirement and still receive their full

monthly pension, without such commuted pension being deducted from their monthly

pensions. Minutes on Pension was amended to reflect this by Gazette No. 709 dated 03rd

April 1992. The said Gazette amended the Minutes on Pension with retrospective effect,

i.e., with effect from 18th October 1990, which is the date on which Circular 44/90 was

issued. Judges of Superior Courts also received this benefit in terms of Section 25 read

with Section 2, 2A and 2B of the Minutes on Pension.72

172. According to the 1st and 27th Respondents, Superior Court Judges received this benefit

until 01st March 2017.73 The Petitioner was elevated to the Court of Appeal on 27th March

2008 and, then, to the Supreme Court on 17th December 2014. It is amply clear that, at

the time of Petitioner’s appointment as a Superior Court Judge, the pension benefit in

terms of aforementioned Circular 44/90 was being paid to the retired Justices of Superior

Courts. In fact, letter dated 10th February 2012 by then Director-General of Pensions,

addressed to the Registrar of the Supreme Court,74 clearly states the following:

“ශ්‍රේෂ්ඨාධිකරණ/ අභියාචනාධිකරණ විනිසුරුවරුන්ට, මනාපය ප්‍රකාශකල කල්හි පාරිශ්‍ර ෝෂිකයක්

ශ්‍රනාලැශ්‍රේ...[Supreme Court and Court of Appeal Judges are entitled to a gratuity upon

expressing their preference/upon election, and the said gratuity is not recovered unlike with

other public officers]”.75

173. There is an express constitutional guarantee to the effect that any person appointed as a

Judge of the Superior Courts would continue to receive any and all salary and pension

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

benefits which are being paid to such Judges at the time of his or her appointment to the

Superior Court. It is subject to this guarantee that a person accepts the lifelong restrictions

attached to such office.

174. If a constitutional guarantee—being the highest form of legal authority—cannot give rise

to a legitimate expectation, then it follows that no lesser law or provision could do so; and

if that were the case, no legal provision could ever be said to create a legitimate

expectation.

175. As such, I am of the view that the practice of the Department of Pensions, aforementioned

correspondence from then Director-General of Pensions along with the constitutional

guarantee set out in Article 108(2) of the Constitution in particular, taken as a whole, is

most certainly capable of giving rise to a legitimate expectation. The impugned acts of

the Respondents have clearly violated this legitimate expectation, rendering such actions

per se unreasonable.

176. While submissions were also made as to whether a legitimate expectation has been

created with respect to other Judges of the Superior Courts, considering the foregoing

discussion with respect to the interpretation of Article 108(2) of the Constitution and the

conclusion that follows, I see no necessity to consider this aspect in detail, for that would

have no bearing on the outcome of this application.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

177. If I may once again quote Alexander Hamilton from the Federalist No. 79,

“In the general course of human nature, a power over a man’s subsistence amounts

to a power over his will”76

76 Alexander Hamilton, ‘Federalist No. 79: The Judiciary Continued’ (McLEAN's Edition, New York)

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 67 of 78

178. The dangers of allowing any direct or circuitous methods to influence the salaries and

pension entitlement of judges cannot be gainsaid. If the executive and legislative

branches are left entirely to their own devices to increase or decrease the remuneration

and other entitlements of judges, by such overt or covert means, it leaves these two

branches of power with the means and opportunity to exert economic pressure on the

individual members of a ‘disobedient’ third branch. Even if this risk never comes to realise,

the mere impression arising out of the existence of such highly coercive authority is

sufficient to compel at least some judicial office bearers to choose compliance over

confrontation, and to make those cautious and popular decisions over the sincere, daring,

and judicious.

179. I take the view that Article 108 of the Constitution is one provision from which no

derogation can be allowed, for that may have lasting effects on the independence and

the quality of judicial office bearers.

180. Some may, at first glance, fail to see why such independence and the quality is so

paramount; But those who understand the science of law and governance, I trust, would

come to see the values that are truly at stake.

181. The deliberate or negligent erosion of the judicial institution provides the most direct path

for those in authority to advance toward corruption and authoritarianism. When holders

of executive and legislative power betray the confidence reposed in them by the people,

it is ultimately the judiciary—as the custodians of judicial power—that must serve as the

safeguard. Judicial officers must therefore owe allegiance solely to the public trust and,

by extension, to the Rule of Law. In fulfilling this duty, they are required to remain

steadfast and resolute. For a judge must do what the law compels him to do, he ought to

be free from any fear of repercussions. While judicial office may not be for the faint

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 68 of 78

hearted, it must also not become an endeavour only the bravest, the wealthiest and the

most daring can stomach.

182. As Chief Justice Rehnquist observed “[t]he Constitution protects judicial independence not

to benefit judges, but to promote the rule of law.”77 And as Justice Kennedy aptly put it,

“Judicial independence is not conferred so judges can do as they please. Judicial

independence is conferred so judges can do as they must.”78

183. This is precisely why strict constitutional safeguards such as Article 108 of our Constitution

are put in place to prevent coercive control and potential manipulations of those

entrusted with the judicial power of the people. It is amply clear that the purpose of this

Article is to prevent the use salary and pension benefits as a bargaining chip, as it were,

to potentially influence the judicial will.

184. As to the acts impugned by the instant application, needless to say, it is very much open

for the executive or legislative powers to influence the judicial will through the threat of

implementation, or the promise of non-implementation, of the recovery of commuted

pension. It is my considered view that the impugned acts clearly fall within the kind of

mischief this Article intends to address and prevent.

185. I wish to further emphasise that even the covert reductions of salaries and pensions would

amount to a violation of Article 108(2) of the Constitution. Actions such as replacing one

type of allowance with another, which, while being of equivalent value today, would

naturally deflate and diminish as time passes; or substituting a percentage-based

allowance, designed to rise proportionally with a certain variable such as basic pay, with

77 Chief Justice Rehnquist ‘2004 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary’ (January 1, 2005), at p. 4

78 Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr, ‘2024 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary’ (December 31, 2024), at p. 3-4, citing A. M. Kennedy, Testimony in Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing on Judicial Independence, 2007.

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 69 of 78

a fixed sum, would, in effect, constitute such a covert reductions violative of Article 108(2)

of the Constitution. Although fixed-rate compensation and benefits may create an

ostensible impression of certainty, such measures, in substance, amount to a prospective

diminution, for they effectively preclude the benefit from being increased in tandem with

the salary.

FINDINGS

186. I am mindful of the fact that this judgment may have been plenty repetitive. It was by no

means an easy opinion to author, for there were nearly 35 years of circulars, decisions,

memoranda and other bureaucratic rigmarole placed before this bench to be reviewed.

In all such detail, I fear, the exact effect of Article 108(2) of the Constitution, which I

endeavoured to uncover hereabove, may just be lost.

187. If I were to frame my findings in the simplest of terms, Article 108(2) of the Constitution

prohibits the reduction of salaries and pension entitlements of the Judges of Superior

Courts, by overt or covert methods. While such salaries and pension entitlements may be

increased as and when appropriate, any reduction or amendment to such entitlements

that could potentially cause benefits to be deflated at a future time, can only be done by

law approved by a two thirds majority in Parliament as well by the People at a referendum,

as the reduction of salary and pension benefits will violate Article 108 read with Articles 3

and 4, as well as Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

188. A series of administrative oversights and errors have triggered the sequence of events

precipitating the Petitioner’s grievance as well as the Cabinet decisions to recover the

commuted pension granted to Superior Court Judges, and I am convinced by the learned

Deputy Solicitor General’s submissions that there had been no mala fides on the part of

the Respondents.

189. Considering all the material discussed hereinabove, I find that all decisions, and steps

S. Thurairaja, PC, J

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 70 of 78

taken pursuant to such decisions, to recover the commuted pension payable to the

Superior Court Judges, including any Resolutions passed in Parliament to that effect, are

ultra vires, illegal, irrational and are violative of Articles 108(1), 108(2) read with Article 3

and 4 as well as 12(1) of the Constitution. Accordingly, all such steps, decisions, including

the decisions of the Cabinet of Minister and Parliamentary Resolutions, to recover

‘commuted pension’ from the Retired Judges of Superior Courts are void and of no force

or avail in law.

190. As such, I hold that the recovery of the ‘commuted pension’ paid to Superior Court Judges

by the 1st Respondent, the Director General of Pensions, is violative of the fundamental

rights of the Petitioner, as well of other Retired Judges of Superior Courts, guaranteed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. All such steps and decisions taken to that end,

including the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers and Parliamentary Resolutions, are

hereby declared null and void.

191. As pension benefits given to Judges of Superior Court by Circular No. 44/90 dated 18th

October 1990 cannot be withdrawn without following the aforementioned procedure set

out in the Constitution, the 1st Respondent is accordingly directed to continue the

payment of unreduced monthly pension to Judges of Superior Courts without deducting

the ‘commuted pension/gratuity’.

192. Application is hereby allowed. I make no order as to costs. The Registrar of the Supreme

Court is directed to forward this judgment to the Director General of Pensions and other

relevant parties for necessary action.

Application Allowed.

193. I have had the advantage of reading the draft judgment prepared by my learned brother,

Justice Thurairaja. However, I regret that I am unable to agree with it.

194. Prior to 1990, the pension benefits of a Judge of the Supreme Court were governed

primarily by section 25 of the Minutes of Pensions. Under section 51 thereof, such Minutes

could be amended by the subject Minister. Pursuant to this framework, if a Judge of the

Supreme Court or Court of Appeal elected to receive a commuted pension, that option

was available to him, with the commuted sum being recoverable from his pension in

instalments.

195. When this system was in place, as evidenced by the Cabinet Memoranda placed before

this Court, the then Government adopted a policy to encourage “public officers” to opt

for voluntary retirement. Pursuant to that policy decision, Public Administration Circular

No. 44/90 dated 18.10.1990 was issued. According to this Circular, inter alia, a public

officer who had completed 30 years of service became eligible to receive an unrecoverable

commuted pension together with an unreduced monthly pension equivalent to 90

percent of his salary at the time of retirement.

196. After six years, Circular No. 44/90 was cancelled by Public Administration Circular No.

32/96 dated 12.11.1996, and stated that all retirements after 23.12.1996 will be in

accordance with the Minutes of Pensions as was the case prior to Circular No. 44/90.

197. By Gazette No. 1190/18 dated 28.06.2001, the subject Minister repealed section 25 of the

Minutes of Pensions applicable to the Judges of the Supreme Court and, inter alia,

introduced a scheme whereby a Judge of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal who

had served for thirty-six months (whether as a Judge of the Supreme Court, the Court of

Appeal, or both) would, upon retirement, be entitled to a pension calculated at 90 percent

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J (Dissenting)

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 72 of 78

of the last drawn salary. However, the Gazette made no provision for the grant of a

commuted pension.

198. Nonetheless, upon “an opinion expressed by the Attorney General” in 1997 that Circular

No. 32/96 has no application to Judges referred to in Article 108(2) of the Constitution, as

it would have the effect of reducing their pension entitlement, the Department of

Pensions has continued to pay the unrecovered commuted pension together with the

unreduced pension to Judges, thereby extending the benefit that had been introduced

under the repealed Circular No. 44/90.

199. The Auditor General questioned this practice in 2015, and several Cabinet decisions have

thereafter been taken, including one in 2025, affirming that the commuted pension, once

paid, shall be deducted from the monthly pension.

200. It is clear that there is no dispute regarding the entitlement of a retired Judge of the

Supreme Court to receive 90 percent of his last drawn salary as the monthly pension.

There is likewise no live issue concerning the grant of a commuted pension where the

Judge elects to receive it, although 2001 Gazette does not provide for it. The only

outstanding issue is whether such commuted pension shall be unrecoverable.

201. The petitioner’s contention is that his monthly pension cannot be reduced in order to

effect the recovery of the commuted pension on instalment basis. He argues that, in terms

of Article 108(2) of the Constitution, the pension entitlement of a Judge of a Superior

Court shall not be reduced after his appointment, and that, accordingly, the respondents

cannot deny him an unrecoverable commuted pension together with an unreduced

monthly pension equivalent to 90 percent of his salary at retirement, a benefit introduced

by Circular No. 44/90, notwithstanding its subsequent cancellation prior to his

appointment as a Judge of the Court of Appeal. This is the crux of the matter. All other

ancillary issues are beside the point.

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J (Dissenting)

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 73 of 78

202. I find myself unable to accept the above argument. Article 108(2) provides that “The salary

payable to, and the pension entitlement of, a Judge of the Supreme Court and a Judge of

the Court of Appeal shall not be reduced after his appointment.” The petitioner, retired as

a Judge of the Supreme Court, was appointed a Judge of the Court of Appeal in 2008. By

that time Circular No. 44/90 was not in operation, as it was withdrawn in 1996. The

recovery of the commuted pension in instalments without interest, which is an advance

lump-sum payment, does not amount to a reduction of the pension. It in no way impinges

upon the independence of the judiciary or the sovereignty of the people. Circular No.

44/90 was issued for a specific and temporary purpose. Once that purpose was achieved,

the Government withdrew it and reverted to the Minutes of Pensions. This is perfectly in

order. If the petitioner’s argument is correct, any enhanced payment made even through

mistake by a subject clerk would necessarily have to be continued, thereby perpetuating

the error. The petitioner’s contention that, by virtue of Article 108(2), the Government

must continue paying Judges an unrecoverable commuted pension, or that, having paid

the commuted pension, the Government is precluded from recovering it from the monthly

pension, cannot be sustained.

203. The petitioner finally submits that he must at least succeed on the doctrine of legitimate

expectation. For a claim based on legitimate expectation to succeed, the expectation must

be founded on a legal and legitimate basis, not on an illegal or improper basis. On the

facts and circumstances of this case, I find no such basis.

204. There is no violation of either Article 12(1) or Article 108(2) of the Constitution. I

accordingly dismiss the application, but without costs.

205. I have had the benefit of reading the Judgments of my learned brother Thurairaja, PC, J.,

and Samayawardhena, J., and I wish to record the following observations.

206. By Public Administration Circular No. 44/90 dated 18/10/1990, a public officer who had

completed thirty years of service or more became eligible, upon retirement, to receive an

unrecoverable commuted pension equivalent to ninety per cent (90%) of the salary. This

Circular was subsequently cancelled by Public Administration Circular No. 32/96 dated

12/11/1996, read with Circular No. 32/96(1) dated 16/12/1996. The cancellation was given

effect to by Gazette No. 981 dated 19/06/1997.

207. Upon the coming into force of Gazette No. 981, advice was sought by the Registrar of the

Supreme Court from the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration regarding the

applicability of the said Gazette to Judges of the Superior Courts, having regard to Article

108(2) of the Constitution. The Attorney General, by opinion dated 15/09/1997, advised

that the pension payable to Judges of the Superior Courts must continue to be computed

based on Circular No. 44/90, and that Gazette No. 981 of 19/06/1997 had no application

to Judges falling within Article 108(2), since its application would have the effect of

reducing their pension entitlements.

208. The Attorney General further opined that, upon appointment, even though a Judge’s

pension entitlement may be increased at any stage, once increased, such entitlement

cannot thereafter be varied or altered if the variation results in a reduction of the pension

payable.

209. It is of significance to note that, acting upon this advice, the pension of Judges of the

Superior Courts was paid without deduction for nearly fifteen years. It was only following

an Audit Query dated 16/02/2015, and a subsequent decision of the Audit and

Management Committee of the Ministry of Public Administration, that steps were taken

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne, J.

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 75 of 78

to recover the commuted pension amounts from the monthly pensions of Judges of the

Superior Courts.

210. In January 2018, the Attorney General once again reiterated that Judges of the Superior

Courts constitute a distinct constitutional class under Article 108, and that neither their

salaries nor their pension benefits can be reduced after appointment. It was further

emphasized that the Constitution vests authority over judicial remuneration exclusively in

Parliament, and that any executive or administrative interference in derogation of this

mandate would undermine the independence of the judiciary.

211. The question that arises for consideration is whether Circular No. 44/90, which has been

expressly or by necessary implication superseded by subsequent circulars, Cabinet

decisions, and order papers, can nevertheless continue to regulate the pension

entitlements of Judges of the Superior Courts, or whether such subsequent executive or

quasi-administrative instruments are legally competent to curtail, abridge, or otherwise

varied from constitutional guarantees to his disadvantage after his appointment.

212. I concur with my brother, Justice Thurairaja, on the factual findings based on the

documents presented by the Petitioner, and therefore, shall refrain from an analysis of the

documents referred to therein.

213. Before proceeding further, it is necessary to emphasize that the Petitioner has filed this

action not solely to vindicate his individual pension benefits but also to assert the broader

constitutional principle that “the pension entitlement payable to a Judge of the Supreme

Court and a Judge of the Court of Appeal shall not be reduced after his appointment in

terms of Article 108(2) of the Constitution.”

214. The precise purpose and intent of Circular No. 44/90 are not explicitly stated within the

document. What is, however, clear is that the Government of the time had resolved to

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne, J.

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 76 of 78

grant concessions to public officers retiring under the provisions of the said Circular.

These provisions were intended to apply to all categories of public officers without

exception, including members of the Provincial Public Service and Local Government

Service.

215. Article 108(2) provides that “The salary payable to, and the pension entitlement of, a judge

of the Supreme Court and a Judge of the Court of Appeal shall not be reduced after his

appointment.”

216. Under Circular No. 44/90, the commuted pension payable to public officers, including

Judges of the Superior Courts, was not treated as an advance or loan but as a part of the

terminal benefit. Obtaining this benefit did not result in any reduction of the monthly

pension paid.

217. The subsequent cancellation of that Circular altered the character of the commuted

benefit itself by transforming it into a recoverable liability. The legal effect of this

diminished the net pension payable to a retired Judge.

218. Article 108(2) as mentioned above expressly mandates that the salary payable to, and the

pension entitlement of, a Judge shall not be reduced after appointment. This provision is

absolute in form and allows for no exception except through a constitutional limitation.

Consequently, any executive or administrative quasi-legislation must necessarily give way

to this constitutional guarantee.

219. While Circular No. 32/96 and the subsequent Gazette may be valid as rules made for the

regulation of the orderly conduct and affairs of public administration, they cannot operate

retrospectively or prospectively to diminish a pension entitlement already constitutionally

protected. To the extent that the cancellation of Circular No. 44/90 has the effect of

reducing pension benefits, altering the method of commutation to the detriment of a

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne, J.

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 77 of 78

Judge, or authorizing recovery or adjustment of sums already paid, such enforcement

would amount in substance to a reduction of a beneficial entitlement prohibited by Article

108(2) of the Constitution.

220. As held in Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920)

“The primary purpose of the Constitution in providing (Art. I, § 1, cl. 6) that the

compensation of the judges "shall not be diminished during their continuance in

office" was not to benefit the judges, but to attract fit men to the bench and insure

that independence of action and judgment which is essential to the maintenance of

the Constitution and the impartial administration of justice. Pp. 253 U. S. 248, 253

U. S. 253.

Such being its purpose, the limitation is to be construed not as a private grant, but

as a limitation imposed in the public interest -- not restrictively, but in accord with

its spirit and the principle on which it proceeds. P. 253 U. S. 253.

Any diminution which by necessary operation and effect withholds or takes from the

judge a part of that which has been promised by law for his services must be regarded

as within the limitation.”

221. What is constitutionally material is not the form of the mechanism adopted, but its effect

upon the remuneration secured to the Judge.

222. Hence, any attempt to recover the commuted amount by monthly deductions from the

pension payable to a Judge necessarily results in a diminution of the pension received

and therefore constitutes a reduction in the sum that was originally guaranteed, which

the Constitution expressly prohibits. In the absence of exceptional circumstances such as

recovery of sums obtained by fraud or established clerical error through due process of

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne, J.

SC/FR/282/18 JUDGMENT Page 78 of 78

law, any monthly recovery of a commuted pension from a Judge is unconstitutional and

void.

223. Accordingly, Public Administration Circular Nos. 32/96 and 32/96(1), notwithstanding

their publication in Gazette No. 981 of 19/06/1997, cannot be enforced against Judges of

the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal in any manner that results in a reduction of

salary or pension entitlement protected by Article 108(2). Such circulars may, at best,

operate only in respect of persons who do not enjoy constitutional protection, and cannot

be invoked to defeat or curtail an absolute judicial right guaranteed by an express and

unequivocal provision of the Constitution.

224. Therefore, Gazette No. 981 of 19/06/1997 and subsequent administrative decisions

cannot reduce judicial pension entitlements, which have been guaranteed under Article

108(2) of the Constitution.

225. In the above circumstances, I agree with the findings of the Judgment of Justice Thurairaja.
