This is what abandonment means. It contains both a physical and a mental element. A temporary absence from a place does not mean that the place is abandoned; there must be shown also an intention not to return. So to the physical failure to perform a contractual duty there must be added the intention to abandon future performance. Proof of intention is not always easy, and the object of Rule 980 is to allow the intention to be assumed from the fact of absence without reasonable explanation for fifteen days. The explanation has not got to be one that exonerates the staff member from breach of contract or from other disciplinary measures, but it has to be one which negatives the intention to abandon..........\u201d [emphasis added] (6) That the concept of vaca\u019fon of post comprises of two elements has long been",

The High Court has correctly concluded that the Applicant did neither and that the Applicant did not even respond to the several le\u01a9ers sent to her reques\u019fng that she report for duty. The second conclusion reached by the High Court is with regard to what transpired on 29th January 2016, with the High Court agreeing with the Labour Tribunal that the Applicant visited the head o\ufb03ce on that day only to present her three op\u019fons and not with an inten\u019fon to report for duty or in compliance with the transfer order, thus demonstra\u019fng that the Applicant did not have the inten\u019fon to resume her employment.",
