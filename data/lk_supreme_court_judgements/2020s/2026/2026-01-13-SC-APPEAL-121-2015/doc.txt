Samayawardhena, J.

This partition action was instituted in the year 2000. After trial, judgment

was delivered in 2006. The final partition plan was thereafter prepared in

accordance with the interlocutory decree and was affirmed by court in 2007.

This was followed by entering the final decree of partition in 2008.

It is significant that both the preliminary plan and the final partition plan

were prepared by the same surveyor, and that the boundaries and extent

reflected in both plans are identical. Upon the application of the 1ˢᵗ and 7ᵗʰ

SC/APPEAL/121/2015

defendants, delivery of possession of the respective lots was effected in 2009

by the Fiscal, with the assistance of the same surveyor.

The appellant was not a party to the partition action. Admittedly, he has no

rights to the land that was partitioned. He purchased a portion of land lying

outside the corpus after the institution of the partition action and after the

preliminary survey had already been carried out. In 2009, he filed an

application for restitutio in integrum before the High Court, seeking to set

aside the interlocutory decree and the final decree of partition, or, in the

alternative, a direction that the final partition plan be prepared in

accordance with the preliminary plan. His complaint was that a portion of

his access road, which lay along the southern boundary of the corpus, had

been erroneously included within the corpus. The High Court dismissed the

application, and this appeal is against that judgment.

On the facts and circumstances of this case, it is abundantly clear that the

appellant cannot seek to set aside either the interlocutory decree or the final

decree of partition. His alternative relief is equally untenable, as both the

preliminary plan and the final plan were prepared by the same surveyor and

there are no discrepancies in terms of boundaries or extent. In his report

accompanying the final plan, the surveyor states that he visited the land

and identified the boundary marks fixed at the time of the preliminary

survey (කේෂ්ත්‍රයට ක ොස‍ මොයිම් පොදො ත්කෙමි) before sub-division in terms of the

interlocutory decree. Moreover, when executing the writ on the application

of the 1st and 7th defendants, the Fiscal proceeded to the land together with

the same surveyor for the purpose of demarcating the boundaries and

handing over possession. There is no mistake in identifying the southern

boundary of the corpus in terms of the preliminary plan.

The appellant has tendered a plan in support of his application before the

High Court to demonstrate that a strip of land forming part of the access

road has been included within the corpus. That document is not a plan in

4

SC/APPEAL/121/2015

the proper sense, but merely a tracing prepared by a private surveyor using

certified copies of the preliminary plan and the final partition plan. It is

unnecessary to emphasise the unreliability of such a superimposition for

the purpose of identifying an alleged encroachment. Significantly, the

private surveyor has not even tendered an affidavit explaining the basis of

his opinion. In any event, such a document cannot prevail over the

preliminary plan and the final partition plan prepared by the court

commissioner.

I find no justifiable reason to interfere with the judgment of the High Court.

The appeal is dismissed. No costs.
