Furthermore, when the deed of gift given to the Defendant was cancelled by Sudharma Madugalle, the extent of paddy land exceeded the limit that one can keep for oneself and therefore, the L.R.C. became the owner again and that Sudharma Madugalle became the statutory lessee. It is also stated that, in that backdrop, the gift made to the Plaintiff after the revocation of the gift given to the Defendant is not valid. It is also stated in the said amended petition that another case, namely No. 7873, has been filed by the Plaintiff against the L.R.C on the basis that said Sudharma Madugalle prescribed to another land around 8 1/2 acres. Thus, it appears that the position of the L.R.C. now is that the Plaintiff and the Defendant are not entitled to the subject matter in suit but the L.R.C is entitled to it, since Sudharma Madugalle, even though a statutory determination was made, had paddy lands exceeding the limit at the time when the impugned gift was made.",

As said before, it has written to the Regional Officer of the Agrarian Services saying that the deed No.25719, by which the gift was made to the Defendant, is valid. It appears that, based on such communications, the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development has decided to remove the name of the Plaintiff from the Registers and insert the name of the Defendant. It is clear from the plaint that the Plaintiffs cause of action is based on the Defendants conduct challenging the title claimed by the Plaintiff by his attempt to get his name inserted in the agricultural land register as the owner and by execution of his deed of declaration to indicate that he is the owner. When the Plaintiff filed the action to establish his title against the animosities caused by the Defendant to his title, now the L.R.C attempts to intervene and the Defendant attempts to get the L.R.C added as a Defendant to defeat the claim of the Plaintiff. However, if the L.R.C wants to get a declaration of title against the Plaintiff as well as the Defendant after the intervention, it must be stated here that a claim in reconvention cannot be prayed in this case against the Defendant as a claim in reconvention cannot be made against another Defendant in the same case. It must be noted that in terms of sections 73 and 75(e) of the Civil Procedure Code, a defendant can include a claim in reconvention in reply to the claim in the Plaint when the defendant does not admit the said claim made by the Plaintiff.

The action filed by the Plaintiff is a kind of quia temet rei vindicatio action based on his alleged ownership while anticipating intrusions by the Defendant. In such a situation, proof of the fact that the title is with a third party (jus tertii) is sufficient to defeat the claim made by the Plaintiff, and the Defendant even need not prove his title. As far as the Plaintiffs case is concerned, his case is based on an alleged cause of action that was arisen due to the conduct of the Defendant challenging his title by attempting to get his name included as the owner in the Agricultural Register and the Defendants act of executing a deed of declaration. The Defendants position in this regard in his answer was that the title is with L.R.C. Since Jus tertii is a valid defence in a rei vindicatio action, to completely and effectively adjudicate the case presented by the Plaintiff and the Defendant, I do not think that there is any necessity to add L.R.C as a party as it can be decided by leading evidence in relation to the ownership of the L.R.C.

Perhaps, L.R.C has not taken any meaningful step in that regard and in the event any step has been taken to correct the decision made for the benefit of the Defendant due to an act of the L.R.C, the Plaintiff may not even proceed with the present action, because mere deed of declaration made by the Defendant himself cannot have any effect on the rights of the Plaintiff. If the L.R.C conveyed its present position to the inquiry in relation to the correction of Agricultural Land Register and L.R.C was inserted as the owner, the Plaintiff could have advised himself whether to institute an action against L.R.C in that regard. The Defendant with the assistance of communication from the L.R.C has taken steps to get his name registered as the owner in the agricultural land register and as such, the Defendant has created a situation that may pose a threat to the alleged ownership rights of the Plaintiff. Rei Vindicatio action is basically to evict the Defendant who is in possession against the rights of ownership. As per the Plaint, it appears, the Defendant is not in possession. As said before, it is filed as a quia timet action anticipating threats to the alleged rights of ownership while praying for a permanent injunction against the Defendant.

The learned High Court Judges in their judgment as well as the Defendant in his written submissions has mentioned Weeraperuma Vs De Silva 61 N L R 481, The Charted Bank Vs De Silva 67 N L R 135, Arumugam Coomaraswamy Vs Andiris Appuhamy (1985) 2 Sri L R 219, Hilda Perera V Somawathi (2000) 3 Sri L R 219 etc. to indicate that lately our courts also have preferred wider construction. Even the relevant section, namely section 18 of the Civil Procedure Code empowers the court to add any person who ought to have been joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, or whose presence before the Court may be necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the action. However, it must be said that, as per the plaint, this is an action to establish the alleged ownership of the Plaintiff and to vindicate such rights but not an action to get the different stances taken by the L.R.C clarified.",

As said before in this judgment, the cause of action contained in the plaint based on the Defendants alleged acts and the defence contained in the answer in reply to averments in the plaint can be completely and effectually solved without adding the L.R.C but by allowing to lead evidence to prove that the title is with a third party, namely L.R.C. because the defence taken by the answer is Jus Tertii. Jus Tertii is one of the defence that can be taken in a rei vindicatio action which has to be proved by the Defendant and it can be proved by placing necessary evidence. A Court need not add the third party who is said to have title merely because jus tertii is pleaded. By adding L.R.C, what happens is that the Court opens the gate to adjudicate a cause of action that the L.R.C may have against the Plaintiff and the Defendant, to meet which the Plaintiff may have to amend its pleadings. Such a situation may change the complexion of the case from a case against the Defendant based on his alleged acts to a case based on the added defendants cause of action or a cause of action against the added defendant.",

However, all these factors indicate that the intervention or addition of L.R.C would not serve to avoid multiplicity of action. However, now, due to the case filed in the District Court Colombo, the addition of the L.R.C in the case at hand may pose the danger of having contrastive decisions from different forums which is one factor that may be considered in deciding whether the addition would help effectual and complete adjudication. It is pertinent to mention the principal nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa which translates as No one should be tried twice in respect to the same matter. This principle is behind the doctrine of Res Judicata as well as lis alibi pendence- See Mudiyanse et al V Appuhamy (1937) C.L.Rec 254, 256. In this regard, to indicate that two actions can be maintained, the Counsel for the L.R.C has referred to Muthuranee V Thuraisingham (1984) 1 Sri L R 381 and Mudiyanse et al V Appuhamy (1937) C.L. Rec 254,255. The relevant statement of law cited from Muthuranee case refers to the seeking of same relief against same party in two different actions but based on different causes of action. Mudiyanse et al V Appuhamy relates to two different situations, namely one action based on section 247 of the Civil procedure Code and the other as a rei vindicatio action. It appears actions filed under section 247 had been withdrawn with liberty to file fresh action subject to objections that can be taken against the fresh institution. There is no indication that the action in the District Court of Colombo would be withdrawn. Thus, those two cases can be distinguished. On the other hand, it is worthwhile to observe that in Mudiyanse et al V Appuhamy at 256 and 257, in relation to the right to litigate before different tribunals, it is said that such a right is subject to the control of court to prevent its process being abused.",

The L.R.C had tendered its original petition dated 10.10.2014 praying for intervention. It appears that L.R.C had filed its first plaint in DLA/55/15 dated 08.06.2015 before the District Court of Colombo prior to the aforesaid decision dated 18.09.2015 made by the learned District Judge Kurunegala. Therefore, it cannot be said that due to the refusal of intervention, the L.R.C filed the application in the District Court of Colombo. One may argue that institution of another action, namely DLA/16/2016, before the District Court of Colombo was not a fact before the Learned Additional District Judge of Kurunegala when he made the impugned order refusing the intervention of L.R.C to support the correctness of that order. However, as per the written submissions filed on behalf of L.R.C before the District Court, case No. DLA/55/15, which appears to have been withdrawn to file DLA/16/2016, was pending before the Colombo District Court against the Plaintiff and the Defendant. Thus, the application for intervention does not appear to be for the avoidance of multiplicity of actions.

What is quoted above indicates that the said decision considers many aspects such as prejudice that may be caused to the third party who is proposed to be added as a party, prevention of multiplicity of action etc. On the other hand, as at present, if it is permitted, addition of L. R. C may allow two separate proceedings to be conducted in two forums giving an opportunity to reach different conclusions at the end which may be averse to the requirement contained in section 18 of the Civil Procedure Code, namely effectual and complete adjudication. In my view, even if one does not consider the fact that there is another litigation, namely DLA/16/2016, before the Colombo District Court as that fact was not before the Learned Additional District Judge of Kurunegala, still the learned Additional District Judge was correct in refusing to add L.R.C as a party as the dispute L.R.C wants to present cannot be completely and effectually solved as L.R.C cannot make a claim in reconvention against the Defendant. However, as a matter of fact, case No. DLA/ 55/2015 was pending before the District Court of Colombo at the time written submissions were tendered to District Court. If the intention for intervention is only to defeat the claim of the Plaintiff, presenting evidence of third-party title (Jus Tertii) as identified by the learned Additional District Judge would completely and effectually solve the matter presented before the District Court by the Plaintiff and the Defendant. Finally, the general principal referred to above which states that a party claiming adversely to both plaintiff and defendant shall not be added as a party, in my view, does not emanate from the narrow construction but may relates to the incapability of a Defendant in our law to make a claim in reconvention against another Defendant except in special actions such as partition actions where statements of claims that pray for partition are treated as plaints.",
