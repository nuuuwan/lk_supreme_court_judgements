"the order made by the learned District Judge and ordered to add L.R.C as a party.",""
"It appears while commenting on wider construction relating to addition of parties that the learned High",""
"Court Judges have highlighted following matters;",""
"•","If the Court see that, in the transaction brought before it, rights of one of the parties will or may"
"","be affected and other actions may be brought in respect of that transaction, the Court has power"
"","to bring all the parties before it and determine the rights of all in one proceeding."
"•","Where there is one subject matter out of which several disputes arise, all parties may be brought"
"","before the court and all those disputes may be determined at the same time without the delay"
"","and expenses of several trials."
"•","A necessary party means a party whose presence before the court may be necessary for effectual"
"","and  complete  adjudication  of  all  the  questions  involved  in  the  action  and  the  Court  has  the"
"","jurisdiction to add such a party and not otherwise. Such added party is bound by the result of the"
"","action and the question to be settled must be a one that cannot be effectually and completely"
"","settled  unless  he  is  a  party.  What  the  Court  ought  to  see  is  whether  there  is  anything  which"
"","cannot  be  determined owing to the absence of the party proposed to be added or he will be"
"","prejudiced by not being joined as a party."
"•","Addition of parties is there to avoid multiplicity of actions and to diminish the cost of litigation."
"•","In the instant case, the Defendant has taken the defence of Jus Tertii. Though the Plaintiff has"
"","stated that L.R.C has filed an action in District Court of Colombo for a declaration of title, that fact"
"","has not been agitated before the trial judge. Since the matter before the Colombo District Court"
"","had not been decided by that time ‘Res Judicata’ would not be applied."
"•","As per the Plaintiff’s stance the L.R.C has taken two contradictory stances, if added this can be"
"","clarified and combated by the Plaintiff, hence his rights would not be prejudiced."
"•","If the L.R.C is not added the final outcome would affect the rights of the L.R.C."
