"“To  vindicate  is typically to claim  for oneself a right in re. All actions in rem  are called vindications, as"
"opposed to personal actions or condictions”."
"“From the right of ownership springs the vindication of a thing, that is to say, an action in rem by which"
"we sue for a thing which is ours but in the possession of another.”"
"It must be observed that a rei vindicatio action is based on ownership which is held against all others as"
"proof of ownership of a third party makes the action unsuccessful. However, like in a partition action, no"
"wider publicity through public notices is given in rei vindicatio actions in Sri Lanka. Thus, in my view one"
"cannot say that the whole world is bound by a decision given in a rei vindicatio action. Hence, the L.R.C"
"will not be prejudiced by not making it a party in this action as it is not bound by the decision between"
"the Plaintiff and the Defendant when it is not a party."
"Whether the gifts made by Sudharma Madugalle were accepted by the relevant donee or on behalf of"
"them can be ascertained through evidence. It must be noted that acceptance of a gift can be done in many"
"ways and not limited to the placing of the signature on the deed itself. Whether Sudharma Madugalle had"
"lands or paddy lands exceeding the ceiling also can be ascertained through evidence. On the other hand,"
"allowing intervention may extend the case beyond the cause of action presented by the Plaintiff and the"
"case presented by the Defendant in reply when no relief has been prayed against the L.R.C by the Plaintiff."
"Even if intervention is allowed it is questionable whether the L R C can make a claim in reconvention since"
"there is no direct relief prayed against the L R C in the Plaint since no cause of action against the L R C is"
"revealed in the Plaint. It must be observed that what is allowed in claim in reconvention is what can be"
"set  off  or  mutually  adjusted  with  the  claim  made  by  the  Plaintiff-  vide  Silva  V  Perera  5  N  L  R  265,"

"District Judge’s conclusion is that since Jus Tertii is available as a defense and it is for the defendant to"
"prove it and place evidence in that regard, it is not necessary to add L.R.C to proceed with the action."
"High Court (Civil Appellate) Judgment"
"Being  aggrieved  by  the  order  of  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  dated  18.09.2015,  the  L.R.C."
"preferred an Appeal in the High Court of the Northwestern Province Holden in Kurunegala (Exercising Civil"

"learned High Court judges set aside the order of the Learned Additional District Judge and held that the"
