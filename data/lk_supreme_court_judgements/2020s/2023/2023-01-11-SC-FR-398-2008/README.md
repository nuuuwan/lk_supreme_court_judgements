Aluwihare PC. J.,

(1) This is a fundamental rights application by Mohammed Rashid Fathima

Sharmila on behalf of her deceased husband, Mohammed Nizar Mohammed

Irfan, (hereinafter also referred to as the deceased). She petitions that her

deceased husband was apprehended by the 1st to 4th Respondents along with

three other police officers and was shot dead in the following morning by the

3rd Respondent. It is alleged by the 3rd Respondent that the shot was fired when

exercising his right of private defence against an alleged violent attempt by the

Argued on: 07. 06. 2022 Decided on: 03.02.2023

3

deceased to escape the charge of the police officers accompanying him on a

search for concealed weapons. The Petitioner claims that the arrest and

execution of her husband is a violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed

under Article 11, 12(1), 13(1) and 13(4). Leave to proceed, however, was

granted for the alleged violation of all the Articles referred to above, sans

Article 11.

(2) Prior to addressing the issue relating to the alleged violation of fundamental

rights, an illustration of the incidents that transpired leading to the present

application is merited.

(3) Around 1 p.m. on 2nd September 2008, the 1st to 4th Respondents along with

three other police officers, had arrested the deceased on the charges of

allegedly possessing a live hand grenade, murder, attempted murder, and

robbery. About an hour later on the same day, the 1st and 2nd Respondents,

according to the Petitioner, had brought her deceased husband to the

Petitioners home and searched the premises for concealed weapons, albeit

unsuccessfully.

(4) In this instance, the 1st and 2nd Respondents had also assaulted the deceaseds

cousin Mohammed Azar Ghouse Mahamood, a boy of 15 years, who had

visited the Petitioners home after hearing the news about the arrest of the

deceased. The 1st and 2nd Respondents had proceeded to arrest the cousin as

well, and left with both the deceased and his cousin in their custody. The

Petitioners account of this fact is corroborated by the said Ghouse Mahamoods

complaint to the Human Rights Commission marked and produced as P4a and

his affidavit marked and produced as P4b.

(5) The deceased, thereafter, was allegedly detained at the Slave Island Police

Station and he was allowed to contact his wife several times that day.

According to the Petitioner, in the course of the telephone conversations, the

deceased had informed her that he was threatened by the 1st and 2nd

4

Respondents that he would be executed if he failed to produce some weapons

by 10 p.m. that night. The Petitioner who was distressed by these

communications thereafter visited the Slave Island Police Station to meet the

deceased and to ascertain the condition of his health, which had been around

8.30 p.m. on the same day. Police officers at the station had shown the

deceaseds skullcap and said in jest that her husband was safe and was being

fed [porridge]. Contradictorily, however, they have also told that her

husband was safe and was taken to Anuradhapura and was no longer in the

custody of the Slave Island Police Station, and that she would come to know

what happened to her husband the next morning.

(6) Early next morning [3rd September], the deceased had been allegedly taken by

the police to Maligawaththa and Kotahena, for the purpose of locating

weapons and to arrest two other suspects. The Petitioner, becoming privy to

rumours that her husband had been shot dead near Gaspaha junction (

), she had visited the said location to find her husbands dead body inside

the Police vehicle No. 32-8466.

(7) The facts of this incident had been reported to the Chief Magistrate of Colombo

under case number B6578/01/2008. (Vide P5). In the course of the evidence

led at the Inquest before the Magistrate, it was revealed that the deceased was

travelling within the police area of Pettah, in the Police vehicle No. 32-8466

with eight (8) Police officers. While so travelling, the deceased, who was

handcuffed at the time, allegedly attempted to escape from the moving vehicle

by seizing the weapon of Sergeant Pulleperuma and making an attempt to fire

at 3rd Respondent, Sergeant Karunathilake. At that moment, the deceased had

been shot twice by the 3rd Respondent; once in the chest and once in the

abdomen, allegedly exercising his right of private defence.

(8) The cause of death, according to the Judicial Medical Officer, was close range

rifled firearm injury to the chest and abdomen. (Vide 4R3). With this

sequence of events in mind, before venturing into the many inconsistencies

5

between the Petitioners and Respondents versions of events, it is pertinent to

make a brief comment at the outset on the locus standi of the Petitioner.

Locus Standi of the Petitioner

(9) Earlier, the position pertaining to locus standi was that a Petitioner can

complain only of the violation of his or her own fundamental rights. Action

could only be filed by the Petitioner or by an Attorney-at-law acting on the

Petitioners behalf, as per a plain, natural, ordinary, grammatical and literal

reading of Article 126(2) (Somawathie v Weerasinghe (1990) 2 Sri LR 121 at

124).

(10) Subsequently, however, with the pronouncement of the principles laid down

by Fernando J. in the case of Kotabadu Durage Sriyani Silva v Chanaka

Iddamalgoda, Officer-in-Charge, Police Station Payagala (2003) 1 Sri LR 14,

it is now well-established and solidified law that the next of kin has a right to

sue on behalf of the deceased, in order to uphold the right to life implicit in

Article 13(4). To hold that no one is entitled to sue the wrongdoers in the

present case, would mean that there is no remedy for a violation of Article

13(4) by causing death itself, but an imminent threat to ones life and liberty

is remediable; rendering the right to life impliedly recognised by this Court

under Article 13(4) merely illusory. In such circumstances, the need to avoid

anomalies, inconsistencies and injustice calls for an expansive interpretation

of the constitutional remedy provided by Article 126(2).

(11) This view was endorsed by Justice Shirani Bandaranayake [as she then was] in

Lama Hewage Lal (deceased) and Rani Fernando (wife of deceased Lal) v. OIC

Seeduwa Police Station (2005) 1 Sri LR 40, 45 where her ladyship held; that

after the decision of Sriyani Silva (supra), it is therefore settled law that the

lawful heirs and/or dependants of a person who is deceased as a result of an

act of torture should be entitled to a declaration of the violation and

compensation.

6

(12) Furthermore, of particular relevance to the present case, is Article 14.1 of the

Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading

Treatment or Punishment of 1984, to which Sri Lanka is a party, posits in the

event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of torture, his dependants

shall be entitled to compensation." The interpretation that the right to

compensation accrues to or devolves on the deceased's lawful heirs and/or

dependants brings our law into conformity with international obligations and

standards, incorporated through the enabling legislation, the Convention

against Torture and other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or

Punishment Act, No. 22 of 1994, and must be preferred. Such an interpretation

is also bolstered by Article 4(d) of the Constitution.

(13) In the present instance, the deceased's rights have accrued or devolved on his

next of kin. The Petitioner, therefore avails herself of the remedy available to

the deceased. Hence, the present Application is in accordance with Article

126(2) of the Constitution. Having established the locus standi of the

Petitioner, it is apposite to consider the credibility of the Respondents

narrative.

Shifting stances in the Respondents Narrative

(14) The credibility and consistency of the Respondents narrative are called into

question, due to the shifting of positions from the very inception to the

conclusion of their account of the events that transpired, and the discrepancies

that can be observed.

(15) There is an incongruity inter-se between the affidavits of the Respondents even

after they were re-submitted after amending, in 2011. Inconsistency is

observed even in the basic fact as to who arrested the deceased at the

Maligawatte Applewatte Milad Mosque. In the 1st Respondents affidavit, it is

averred that he assisted Police Sergeant Karunathilake in the arrest of the

deceased, while the 2nd Respondent has taken up the position that it was one

Police Sergeant Kaluarachchi who made the arrest [paragraph 7 of the 2nd

7

Respondents affidavit]. According to the affidavit of the 3rd Respondent

Karunathilake, he has also assisted one Police Sergeant Kaluarachchi in

making the arrest of the deceased. Interestingly, it was the 4th Respondent,

Kaluarachchi, who is an Inspector of Police who had made an entry in the

Information Book pertaining to the arrest of the deceased (vide 4R2A). This

fact was also admitted in the testimonies of 1st, 3rd and 4th Respondents in the

inquest Proceedings (vide P5). The lack of consistency in their own narration

of events at the Magistrates Court and before this Court is telling of the

incoherence in their narrative.

(16) Further, it is submitted by the Petitioner that her deceased husbands cousin

Mohammed Azar Ghouse Mahamood [hereinafter referred to as Ghouse], a

young schoolboy of 15 years of age, who had visited her house upon hearing

the distressing news of the deceaseds arrest, had also been arrested by the

Respondents when they brought the deceased to Petitioners home for a search.

Ghouse had made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission (HRC) on 4th

September 2008 and submitted an affidavit in this regard (P4a and P4b,

respectively) where he states that he was arrested without citing reasons, was

severely beaten, detained inside a bus outside the Slave Island Police Station

and subsequently released without any charges. In his affidavit, the details

about the presence of the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents at the deceaseds house,

the time at which they visited the house, and the manner and the place where

the deceased was detained after being taken to the Slave Island Police station,

are consistent with the IB entries pertaining to the arrest of the deceased

[4R2A]. His account of events is corroborated by the Petitioner and the

parents of the deceased who have also filed complaints with the HRC (vide

P8a). The Respondents merely deny such substantial claims of assault and

arrest in their affidavits, without countering the allegation or providing any

explanation, ebbs away the credence of their version of events.

8

(17) The root of inconsistency goes deeper, down to ascertaining the place of

detention of the deceased. The Petitioner claims that her husband was

detained at the Slave Island police station (paragraph 6(e) of the Petition). She

had even visited the Slave Island police station in the hope of meeting her

husband at which instance she received contradictory information about her

husband being well and being fed porridge, and later was told that he was

taken to Anuradhapura. The Petitioners claim that the deceased was held at

the Slave Island Police station is corroborated by the affidavit of Ghouse, who

states that he witnessed the deceased being placed in a room inside the Slave

Island Police Station (paragraph 6 of P4b). It is also lent credibility by the

Human Rights Commission complaint filed by the deceaseds parents where

they state they were informed by the Legal Officer at the Human Rights

Commission that their son was under the charge of one Kaluarachchi of the

Slave Island police station, the location to which they hurried with the

expectation of seeing their son, but were told to return the next morning. (vide

P8a and P8b).

(18) Yet the 4th Respondent [IP Kaluarchchi] claims, that as per the IB entry

recording the arrest, the deceaseds investigation was to be conducted under

the supervision of Officer-In-Charge of Pettah Police Station, and he was

presented to the Pettah Police Station after arrest. The 4th Respondent goes

further to state that the Petitioner herself was informed of this fact when he

took the deceased to Petitioners house to search for concealed weapons.

(4R2A). In the out entry, (4R5) which is extracted from the IB of the Pettah

police station, the 4th Respondent claims that it was the Pettah Police Station

they left on the morning of 3rd September 2008, taking the deceased along with

them, and this is reiterated in his depositions at the Inquest Proceeding (vide

P5, page 16). But this account by the Respondents naturally raises the

question as to why the aggrieved wife, mother and father of the deceased

would concern themselves with calling over at the Slave Island police station

and receive such perplexing responses from the officers therein, if they were

9

quite dependably informed of the whereabouts of the deceased by the 4th

Respondent. The Respondents have offered no clarification regarding the same.

(19) The credibility of the Respondents narrative is placed in peril owing to

contradictions in the material facts regarding the scuffle in which the

deceaseds death ensued, as portrayed in the original and the amended

affidavits of the Respondents. Given that these affidavits were filed by officers

of the Police who are well-versed in and much dependent upon the accuracy

of the detailed notes they take pertaining to each investigation, such lapses

raise incredulity. The original affidavits of the 1st to 4th Respondents filed on

18th February 2010 had stated in unanimity that they categorically deny that

the deceased was handcuffed while he was travelling in the Police vehicle No.

32-8466 along with 8 armed police officers, which is inconsistent with the

depositions of the 4th Respondent before the Inquest (vide P5, page 15). It

also contradicts the in entry of the IB on 3rd September 2008 (vide 4R5A),

where he stated that the deceased was handcuffed.

(20) However, the original affidavits were amended after a lapse of more than a

year in August 2011, to read that the Respondents categorically deny that the

handcuffed deceased was travelling in the Police vehicle, reverting from

their original position and conjuring the unconvincing image of an individual

defined by the Respondents themselves as an an absconding under-world

gang leader wanted by the police in connection with offences of attempted

murders, murder and robbery known to be adept at wielding a gun, being

taken around with such scant security measures. This renders the narrative of

the Respondents further implausible and wavering.

(21) Irregularities are also observed as to the time of death. It is stated in the out

entry by the 4th Respondent (Vide 4R5) and in his depositions at the Inquest

(Vide P5), that 8 Police Officers left the Pettah Police Station with the deceased

to Kotahena and Maligawatte at the dawn of 3rd September, 2008 at 4.05 a.m.

in order to locate some weapons and arrest Nilafer and Azmi mama, based

10

on information revealed through the deceaseds statements (Vide 4R5).

However, the in entry registers that at 4.50 a.m. After 45 minutes] they were

still travelling towards Barber Street along the Pettah Main Street when the

scuffle occurred and the deceased was shot dead (Vide 4R5A). The distance

from Pettah to Maligawatte (approximately 3 Km) and the time taken to make

the trip, makes it questionable why this journey had to be made while the

surrounding was still dark, given that the main aim of the journey was to locate

weapons. The requirement of undertaking an urgent search operation, being

pressed by some urgent concern is nowhere expressed by the Respondents. It

was only bound to limit the efficiency and success of their search.

(22) The Respondents are seen to be well-aware that the deceased was an under-

world gang leader adept at handling weapons. Experienced Police officers

acting with a mind to preventing exigencies routinely take sufficient care when

transporting such a detainee. But a question is raised as to why such care was

not exercised in the present instance, given that in the out entry, as they left

for the search, Police Inspector Kaluarachchi had advised the police officers

that, as they are embarking on an investigation to arrest hard-core underworld

criminals and to look for their weapons, and suspects who are adept at using

grenades, to be vigilant and careful (vide 4R5). Therefore, it is only natural

that the officers should have, in the ordinary course of events, taken extreme

care to ensure that their weapons are out of reach of the deceased suspect.

However, an extra degree of care taken to prevent such an exigency is not

exhibited in the conduct of the 8 police officers, with 6 out of them being

armed, and the deceaseds actions limited to the confined space of the moving

Police vehicle.

(23) As per the above analysis, it is my considered opinion that the Respondents

version of the events is contradictory, improbable and thus must be refuted. In

this context, it should be examined whether the conduct of the Respondents

11

have violated the rights afforded to the deceased under Article 12(1), 13(1)

and 13(4).

Violation of Article 12 (1)

(24) Article 12 (1) of the Constitution embodies two vibrant concepts - equality

before the law and equal protection of the law to all persons. The two limbs of

this Article are lucidly elaborated by Ivor Jennings in, Law of the Constitution,

5th edition, at page 50 where he posits that,

[e]quality before the law is a negative concept implying the absence of

any special privilege in favour of any individual and the equal subjection

of all classes to the ordinary law. Equal protection of the law is a more

positive concept and implies equality of treatment in equal

circumstances.

(25) In the present case, the alleged criminal record of the deceased is immaterial

to a violation of his fundamental rights ensured by the Constitution. As each

person ought to be subjected equally to the ordinary law of the country, the

deceased should similarly be subjected to a fair trial before a competent court

and be found guilty of any charges against him. In any case, he is equally

entitled to receive the same protection of his fundamental rights as any other

citizen in the same circumstances. It is quoted with approval that this was

correctly noted by Fernando J in Sriyani Silva v. Iddamalgoda (supra) at pages

78-79, [r]espondents should have concentrated their efforts to have the

allegations against the deceased determined by a competent Court, after a fair

trial. Until then the deceased was entitled to the benefit of the presumption of

innocence.

(26) Annexure 4R1 which notes down fifteen allegations against the deceased is

merely a sheet of paper on which 15 case numbers are typed alleging that the

deceased was treated as a suspect in those cases. 4R1 is not a document

maintained by the police in the normal course of their duties, but appears to

be a document prepared to counter the allegations against the Respondents in

the instant application, whereas the Respondents could have filed copies of the

B Reports filed by the police when facts were reported to court citing the

12

deceased as a suspect in those respective cases. In this backdrop, it is difficult

to place much credence on 4R1. Thus, the assertion on the part of the

Respondents, that the deceased was a wanted man in connection with many

crimes cannot be relied upon by this court.

(27) In any case, any such supposed allegation has not been determined by a

competent court after a fair trial and until such time, the presumption of

innocence will prevail as per Article 13(5) of the Constitution. Even if his

record was bad, it is now rendered more serious as the deceased has lost his

life, and consequently, lost the opportunity to redeem his bad record. Thus, it

submitted that the argument that the deceased was a known criminal has no

credibility, and has no bearing on his fundamental rights.

(28) It is contended by the Petitioner, quoting Dumbell v. Roberts (1944) All ER

326, 329 as cited in Muthusamy v. Kannangara (1951) 52 NLR 324 and Faiz

v. The Attorney General (1995) 1 Sri LR 372, that the principle innocent until

proven guilty applies to the Police function of arrest. Even in the context of the

arrest being based on a mere list of cases allegedly pending against the

deceased, (Vide 4R1) presented along with an IB entry claiming that the

deceased held a live grenade in his possession at the time of arrest (Vide 4R2A),

the deceased is nevertheless entitled to be protected by the law against

violations of his life and liberty.

(29) This notion is expressed by Justice Sharvananda, in his Treatise, Fundamental

Rights in Sri Lanka at page 84, where citing Paliwadana v. A.G., he states,

The fundamental fact is men are not alike [] what is postulated is

equality of treatment of all persons in utter disregard of every

conceivable circumstance of the differences

(30) Therefore, despite the allegations against him of criminal conduct, in the

absence of an order of a competent court handing down a sentence, the

deceased was entitled to the ordinary and equal protection of the law against

the violation of his fundamental rights by the actions of the 1st-4th Respondents,

13

which resulted in his death. The 5th Respondent who is the officer-in-charge

of the Slave Island police station, was under a duty to take all reasonable steps

to ensure that persons held in custody were treated humanely and in

accordance with the law. This included monitoring the activities of his

subordinates. He did not claim to have taken any steps to ensure that the

deceased was being treated as the law required him to be.

(31) Thus, in light of the foregoing evaluation, it is my considered view that the 1st

to 5th Respondents have violated the fundamental rights of the deceased by

failing to afford equality before the law and equal protection of the law to the

deceased, guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Violation of Article 13 (4)

(32) Article 13(4) prohibits punishing any person with death or imprisonment

except by order of a competent court, made in accordance with the procedure

established by law. In the present case, it is admitted by both parties that the

deceased was shot by the 3rd Respondent and thereafter the deceased

succumbed to the injuries thus inflicted. Therefore, it is not contested that the

death of the deceased was not in accordance with an order of a competent

court.

(33) Bearing in mind the potential criminal liability of the 3rd Respondent, in the

present case, the deceased was put to death by him in the absence of any order

of a competent court to that effect, made in accordance with the procedure

established by the law, in a deliberate violation of the sanctity of his life. This

is corroborated in the Petition by the Petitioner who claims that the deceased

had prior apprehension regarding his imminent execution, which was also

communicated to her. (Vide paragraph 6(f) of the Petition)

(34) The learned Deputy Solicitor General argued on behalf of the Respondents that

Article 12(1) is linked to Articles 13(1) and 13(4) and as such Article 12(1)

cannot stand alone but intrinsically linked to the Articles referred to. His

argument appears to be that if the court cannot come to a finding that the

Respondents have infringed Article 13(1) and 13(4), the court cannot proceed

to consider a violation under Article 12(1). He contended further that the

14

deceased was arrested for possession of a hand grenade and he was informed

of the reasons for the arrest. As such, the respondents cannot be held to have

infringed the rights referred to in Articles 13(1) of the Constitution. It was the

position of the learned DSG that there is no material before court to conclude

the shooting of the deceased was to mete out a punishment to the deceased and

that the exercise of the right of self [private] defence operate as an exception

to Article 13(4). However, it must be noted that a person can be arrested in

accordance with the law, but cannot be punished in violation of it. And this

would engender a denial of equal protection of the law.

(35) Section 89 of the Penal Code stipulates the general provision that nothing is

an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.

However, even though under Section 93, the right of private defence of the

body may extend to causing death when faced with an assault that reasonably

causes apprehension of death, according to Section 92(4), the right in no case

extends to the inflicting of more harm than necessary for the purpose of

defence.

(36) Even assuming that the deceased did make an attempt to escape ; in a situation

where 8 trained policemen, (who were further instructed in advance to be

prepared to face the dangers and exigencies involved in this operation [Vide

4R5]) were accompanying the deceased, with 6 of them armed and easily

able to overpower the deceased by inflicting lesser harm than killing him, the

3rd Respondent is seen to have acted in excess of self-defence. As per Section

92(4) therefore, that defence cannot be extended to the present case. Thus, the

right of self-defence presents a weak case for exculpating the 3rd Respondent

of criminal liability. Having given its mind to the attended facts and

circumstances, the court indeed entertains serious doubts as to whether the

scuffle has indeed transpired, as alleged by the Respondents.

(37) In the Case of Wijesuriya v. The State, 77 NLR 25 (Premawathie Manamperi

Case) which concerned the killing of a prisoner who was a suspected insurgent

held in custody by a military officer, while a state of emergency prevailed in

the country, Alles J. observed the following,

15

there was no justification for the shooting of a suspected insurgent

taken into custody. What then is the position of a soldier subject to

Military Law in such situation? He continues to remain the custodian

of the civil law and it will be his duty to shoulder the responsibility of

police duties, in the discharge of which he is as much subject to the civil

law as the ordinary policeman (at page 32, emphasis added).

(38) It is apparent that a military officers duties during a state of emergency is

equated to those of a police officer, who is the custodian of the civil law and

he/she can offer no justification for killing a prisoner in custody in violation

of the civil law.

(39) Even though the Fundamental Rights Chapter of the Constitution of Sri Lanka

does not consist of a standalone right to life, in Sriyani Silva v. Iddamalgoda

(supra) at page 75, this Court has upheld this right to life as impliedly

recognized by Article 13(4), even if it is of a person accused of a bad record.

The Court held; Although the right to life is not expressly recognised as a

fundamental right, that right is impliedly recognised in some of the provisions

of Chapter III of the Constitution. In particular, Article 13(4) [.] That is to

say, a person has a right not to be put to death because of wrongdoing on his

part, except upon a court order. Expressed positively, that provision means

that a person has a right to live, unless a court orders otherwise. (Emphasis

added).

(40) This implication of right to life was also acknowledged in Lama Hewage Lal

(deceased) and Rani Fernando (wife of deceased Lal) v. OIC Seeduwa Police

Station (supra) at page 45. Bandaranayake J held that without a court order,

no person could be put to death and therefore in the absence of such an order,

any person has a right to live. And when such a right is created, it will naturally

be followed with a remedy, as a right must have a remedy is based on the

principle which is accepted and recognized by the maxim ubi jus ibi

remedium, viz., 'there is no right without a remedy'.

16

(41) Right to life is the most fundamental and basic of human rights and the

fountain from which all the other human rights spring and it therefore is

deserving of the greatest respect. United Nations enshrined the right to life in

Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, postulating that

"everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person".

(42) The right to life is one of the four non-derogable rights which cannot be

suspended even in a state of emergency, common to the International Covenant

on Civil and Political Rights (Article 6), the European Convention on Human

Rights (Article 2) and the American Convention on Human Rights (Article 4)

and is considered as consisting the irreducible core of human rights and a

part of customary international law. In light of this, the judgment of the

European Court of Human Rights in Finucane v. The United Kingdom

(Application no. 29178/95) 1 July 2003, upholding the states obligation to

protect the right to life enshrined in Article 2 of the European Convention on

Human Rights is of great persuasive value of the present case.

The essential purpose of [official investigations when individuals have been

killed as a result of the use of force] is to secure the effective implementation

of the domestic laws which protect the right to life and, in those cases

involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths

occurring under their responsibility. (para. 67)

(43) Therefore, prevention of extra-judicial killings or custodial deaths invites

raising the domestic standards to meet international obligations in upholding

the inviolability of life, supplementing the fundamental rights protections of

the domestic law. The Article 13(4) of the Constitution as applicable to the

present case should be interpreted broadly, especially in view of the States

responsibility of upholding fundamental rights, as enshrined in Article 4(d) of

the Constitution, which requires all organs of government, including the

Police, to "respect, secure and advance" the fundamental rights declared and

recognized by the Constitution and to not abridge, restrict or deny such

rights.

17

(44) Even in the absence of a separate standalone right to life, a purposive

construction of Article 126(2) read with Article 4(d) of the Constitution, would

in the present case, hold the State liable for the arbitrary deprivation of the

deceaseds life by the Respondents utilizing extrajudicial means, in addition to

the liability of the Respondents.

(45) As Justice Sharvananda in the volume, Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka at

page 2, quoting Lord Templeman in Societe United Dock v. Government of

Mauritius (1985) A.C.585, 605 commendably postulates,

A Constitution concerned to protect the fundamental rights and

freedoms of the individual shall not be narrowly construed in a manner

which produces anomalies and inexplicable inconsistencies.

(46) Therefore, relevant Articles of the Constitution should be expansively

interpreted to recognize the right to life inferred in Article 13(4) and the

Petitioners right to be granted relief. Where there is an infringement of the

right to life implicit in Article 13(4), and Article 126(2) must be interpreted in

order to avoid anomaly, inconsistency and injustice.

(47) This argument is in line with what Lord Wilberforce in Minister of Home

Affairs v. Fisher (1979) 3 A.E.R.21, 25 P.C. illustrated regarding fundamental

rights and freedoms provisions, stating that those provisions call for a

generous interpretation, avoiding what has been called the austerity of

tabulated legalism, suitable to give to individuals the full measure of the

fundamental rights and freedoms.

(48) Police brutality should in no terms be allowed to become a fact of normal life

and such trends can only be arrested by the broad application of Fundamental

Rights which should not merely be excellent in theory. Arbitrary executions in

violation of the judicial procedure, by officers of the State should be

condemned. The Police Force cannot, at any instance, undermine the criminal

justice mechanism of the country.

(49) The Indian Supreme Court has delivered a string of judgements on encounter

killings, which term is used to describe extrajudicial killings committed by the

18

law enforcement officers of that country, supposedly in self-defence, when

they encounter suspects.

(50) In Prakash Kadam et al v. Ramprasad Vishwanath Gupta and Another

(2011) 6 SCC 189, Supreme Court of India dismissing the appeal

against the refusal of bail for several police officers held as follows;

The encounter' philosophy is a criminal philosophy, and all

policemen must know thisFake 'encounters' are nothing but cold

blooded, brutal murder by persons who are supposed to uphold the law.

In our opinion, if crimes are committed by ordinary people, ordinary

punishment should be given, but if the offence is committed by

policemen much harsher punishment should be given to them because

they do an act totally contrary to their duties.

(51) In Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa and Others 1993 SCR (2) 581, the Supreme

Court asserted that,

Convicts, prisoners or undertrials are not denuded of their

fundamental rights There is a great responsibility on the police or

prison authorities to ensure that the citizen in its custody is not deprived

of his right to life. His liberty is in the very nature of things

circumscribed by the very fact of his confinement and therefore his

interest in the limited liberty left to him is rather precious. The duty of

care on the part of the State is strict and admits of no exceptions.

(Emphasis added)

(52) As for the liability of the 5th Respondent for violation of Article 13(4),

reiterating what was stated above, he was the Officer-In-Charge of the Slave

Island Police Station, and was under a duty to take all reasonable steps to ensure

that persons held in custody were treated in accordance with the law. That

included monitoring the activities of his subordinate officers of the Divisional

Crime Detection Bureau-Colombo (Central), such as the 3rd Respondent, who

are attached to the Slave Island Police Station and sanctioning their actions.

19

Therefore, he bears responsibility for the deceased being put to death in the

absence of any order of a competent court to that effect, made in accordance

with the procedure established by the law.

(53) For the aforesaid reasons this court holds that the deceased's Fundamental

Right guaranteed under Article 13(4) has been infringed by the 3rd and 5th

Respondents.

Violation of Article 13(1)

(54) Article 13(1) stipulates that no person shall be arrested except according to

procedure established by law. Any person arrested shall be informed of the

reason for his arrest.

The Petitioner has not shown substantial cause to the establishment of the fact

that the deceased was arrested except according to the procedure established

by law and that he was not informed of the reason for his arrest, which was

attributed as being in possession of a live hand grenade. The Respondents

affidavits and the IB entry of the arrest unanimously claim that the reasons for

the arrest were communicated to the deceased, and the reasons are consistent

with those documents. Therefore, there is no material before court to hold that

Article 13(1) was infringed in the present case.

Declarations and Compensation

(55) As per Article 126(4) of the Constitution, the Supreme Court is empowered to

grant such relief as it may deem just and equitable in the circumstances in

respect of any Petition referred to it under Article126(2). Hence, bearing in

mind the Petitioners situation in life; now a single mother with three children

to support, and the emotional and psychological trauma she and the children

may have suffered due to the death, in addition to being deprived of the care

and companionship of a husband and father, compensation is ordered under

the just and equitable jurisdiction of the Court.

(56) As referred to earlier the court held that the deceased's Fundamental Rights

under Articles 12(1), have been infringed by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th

20

Respondents and Article 13(4) by the 3rd and 5th Respondents and by the State,

and that the deceaseds right to compensation has accrued to or devolved on

the Petitioner.

(57) Therefore, I order the State to pay Rs.250, 000/- as compensation to the

Petitioner. In addition, I order the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondent to pay

Rs.25,000/- each to the Petitioner. Further, I order the 4th and 5th Respondent

to pay Rs. 200,000/- each to the petitioner and all payments by the

respondents are to be paid personally.

(58) Before I part with this judgement, I wish to advert to several matters which,

are, to say the least, disturbing. Sri Lanka Police established in 1806, has a

history of over two centuries and one would expect it to develop into a body

that comprises of professional law enforcement personnel. I am at a loss to

understand, in the present day and time as to why such an established law

enforcement entity is incapable of affording due protection to a citizen who is

in their custody. Unfortunately, it is not rare to hear instances of suspects dying

in the hands of the police. It only highlights the utterly unprofessional

approach to duty by the personnel who man it and as a consequence, people

are increasingly losing trust in the police. It had lost the credibility it ought to

enjoy as a law enforcement agency. The incident relevant to this application

had taken place in 2008, however, this court observes that instances of death

of suspects in police custody are continuing to happen, even today. It appears

that the hierarchy of the administration had paid scant attention to arrest this

trend which does not augur well for the law enforcement and the rule of law.

(59) In these circumstances we are of the view that we should direct the 6th

Respondent, the Inspector General of Police to formulate, issue and implement,

guidelines to the police, elaborating the steps that should be taken by each

officer to avoid encounter deaths of this nature in the future.

21

This matter will be mentioned on 24th March 2023 and the 6th Respondent is

directed to report to this court the steps taken by the 6th Respondent in this

regard.
