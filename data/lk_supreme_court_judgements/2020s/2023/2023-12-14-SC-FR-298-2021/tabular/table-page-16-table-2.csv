"and unreasonable, and in violation of the Petitioner’s fundamental right, under Article 12 (1).”"
"(Emphasis added)"
"The petitioner was transferred from Thelikada Police Station on, the ground of exigencies of service,"
"but the 1st Respondent was silent on the relevant provision of Clause 218 of the Procedural Rule he"
"acted upon when making the recommendation."
"As already observed in this order, the 1st Respondent when making his recommendation had heavily"
"relied on the alleged illicit affair of the Petitioner but also referred to the misuse of the official vehicle"
"and fuel allocated to the Police Station and having a close relationship with criminals of the area but"
"in the  absence of any  pending investigation or inquiry based  on  these allegations  the Petitioner is"
"totally  unaware  of  the  reasons  for  his  transfer  except  the  fact  that  he  is  being  transferred  on"
"exigencies of service."
"Clause 218 refers to three different criteria a transfer could be implemented on exigencies of service."
"The Petitioner who faced the transfer on exigencies of service was deprived of properly defending"
"himself  without  knowing  the  real  reason  for  his  transfer,  when  compared  to  a  transfer  made  on"
"disciplinary grounds, where the officer is well aware of the reason for his transfer. The person who is"
"transferred on exigencies of service should have been informed of the reasons behind his transfer. If"
"the Petitioner was informed of the reasons for his transfer he could have properly defended himself"
"before the Public Service Commission when he submitted the appeal and the 1st Respondent would"
"not have been able to mislead the Public Service Commission."
"The  allegation  that  the  2nd  Respondent  was  involved  in  the  transfer  of  the  Petitioner  was  not"
"established before this Court except for the fact that he wanted a particular officer to be appointed"
