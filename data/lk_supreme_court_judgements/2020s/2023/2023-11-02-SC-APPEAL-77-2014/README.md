A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

By Plaint dated 08/07/1996, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred

to as the Plaintiff-Respondent) filed Case bearing No. D.C. Gampaha 39800/P against

the Defendant-Appellant-Appellant (the Defendant-Appellant), and sought a

declaration that the Plaintiff-Respondent and the Defendant-Appellant are each entitled

to half share, to the land to be partitioned called Gonnagahawatta alias

Batadombagahawatta, in extent, 1A and 6P depicted in Village Plan No. 849/P, dated

26/07/1957, made by M.S. Perera, Licensed Surveyor, More fully described in the

schedule to the Plaint.

In paragraph 7 of the said Plaint the Plaintiff-Respondent states that the said land sought

to be partitioned is Lot No. 4, an unallotted portion of land in the Final Plan dated

26/07/1957, in Gampaha District Court Case No. 4095/P, of the land called

Gonnagahawatta alias Batadombagahawatta, in extent, 1A 0R 6P, more fully described

in the schedule to the Plaint. Admittedly, the land sought to be partitioned is depicted

as Lot No. 4 in the said Plan No. 849/P dated 26/07/1957, is an unallotted potion of

land in partition Case No. 4095/P of the District Court of Gampaha.

In the Amended Statement of Claim dated 29/11/2000, the Defendant-Appellant

contends inter alia, that she and her predecessors in title possessed the unallotted Lot

No. 3 in extent of 2R and 8.20P, depicted in Preliminary Plan No. 1175/P, dated

30/07/1998, made by A.C.P. Gunasena, Licensed Surveyor, for a period of over 60

years and thereby acquired prescriptive title to the said Lot No.3 in the said Plan No.

1175/P. On that basis, the Defendant-Appellant contends that presently, she is in

possession and has prescribed to in excess of half share of the land to be partitioned.

Having considered the oral and the documentary evidence led by the respective parties,

the learned Additional District Judge by Judgment dated 24/09/2008, held that the

P a g e 5 | 15

Plaintiff-Respondent and the Defendant-Appellant are each entitled to a half share of

the unallotted portion of land as depicted in the Preliminary Plan No. 1175/P, dated

30/07/1998, made by licensed surveyor A.C.P. Gunasena. The Court also held that the

Defendant-Appellants claim based on prescriptive possession to a portion in excess of

half share of the unallotted portion was not proved and accordingly, the Court granted

relief to the Plaintiff-Respondent as prayed for.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment, the Defendant-Appellant, by Petition of Appeal

dated 21/11/2008, appealed to the High Court of the Western Province exercising civil

appellate jurisdiction holden in Gampaha (the Civil Appeal High Court). The Civil

Appeal High Court, after hearing also considering the question of title of the Plaintiff-

Respondent and the claim of prescriptive possession acquired by the Defendant-

Appellant to the relevant portion, by Judgment dated 22/08/2013, held that;

a) the Defendant-Appellant is entitled only to a half of the unallotted land and that

the Defendant-Appellant has failed to establish any amount in excess of such or

established prescriptive title to any portion of the said land.

b) the Plaintiff-Respondent had purchased the rights of the 7 children of Punchi

Singho and his wife.

c) the Plaintiff-Respondent has established the rights which devolved from Punchi

Singho to the Plaintiff-Respondent.

d) the Deeds marked V1, V2 and V3 produced at the trial before the District Court

by the Defendant-Appellant were not in conformity with the extent of the land

which was claimed by the Defendant-Appellant.

e) the Defendant-Appellant failed to establish prescriptive title to a defined portion

of the corpus.

f) the Defendant-Appellant is entitled only to a half share of the corpus.

P a g e 6 | 15

Accordingly, the Civil Appeal High Court affirmed the said Judgment of the Additional

District Judge dated 24/09/2008, and dismissed the appeal.

The Plaintiff-Appellant, by Petition dated 04/10/2013 is before this Court, to set aside

the said Judgment dated 22/08/2013, delivered by the Civil Appeal High Court.

By Order dated 21/06/2019, this Court granted leave to appeal on the following

questions of law;

1) Whether the Plaintiff has established title to a half share of the corpus?

2) If the answer to the above question of law is in the negative, what is the share

that the Plaintiff is entitled to?

3) Whether the Defendant-Appellant-Appellant was allocated the shares according

to the evidence and the documents led at the trial?

At the commencement of the trial before the District Court, both parties admitted that

the land described in the schedule to the Plaint is the same land as depicted in the

Preliminary Plan No. 1175/P, prepared by licensed surveyor A.C.P. Gunasena. They

also admitted that Patikiri Arachchige Simon Singho and Patikiri Arachchige Andi

Singho were the original owners of the land to be partitioned and were each entitled to

an equal share. At the trial, only the Plaintiff-Respondent and the Defendant-Appellant

testified before the District Court.

The Plaintiff-Respondents position was that both the Plaintiff-Respondent and the

Defendant-Appellant be declared entitled to a half share each to the land described in

the said Preliminary Plan No. 1175/P, dated 30/07/1998.

It is in evidence that Patikiri Arachchige Simon Singho, one of the original owners, by

Deed No. 15767 dated 17/01/1945, marked P2, transferred his undivided half share to

Patikiri Arachchige Punchi Singho. When the said Punchi Singho died, his share

P a g e 7 | 15

devolved on his widow Mahavithanage Helenahamy and their six children according to

inheritance under the pedigree. One child died issueless and his share devolved on

Helenahamy and the rest of the siblings. The said Helenahamy, by Deed No. 23247

marked P3, transferred all her rights to the Plaintiff-Respondent, and the rest of the

children also transferred their rights to the Plaintiff-Respondent by Deeds No. 25483

marked P7, and No. 24132 marked P4, respectively. Accordingly, the Plaintiff-

Respondent purchased the undivided half share of Patikiri Arachchige Punchi Singho

which devolved on his wife Helenahamy and their seven children, thereby claimed

entitlement to half share to the said land.

The Defendant-Appellants position is that;

a) By the Deeds marked P1 to P8, the Plaintiff-Respondent gets title to the said

land only on Deed Nos. 25483 (P7) and 24277 (P8), referred to in the Plaint and

accordingly, would be entitled only to 9/20 share and not half share, as claimed.

b) having possessed the said divided Lot No.3 depicted in Preliminary Plan No.

1175/P dated 30/07/1998, for over 10 years, the Defendant-Appellant has

acquired prescriptive title to a divided and a defined portion of the said land.

c) when the Defendant-Appellant obtained title to the said land by Deed No. 2690

dated 01/06/1973, marked V1, a fence was in existence, as shown in Plan No.

1705 dated 30/11/1973, marked V4 (not referred to in the said title Deed No.

2690), which establish that the Defendant-Appellant possessed and prescribed

to the said Lot 3 of the said Plan No. 1175/P.

d) Patikiri Arachchige Amarasena is also a child of Patikiri Arachchige Punchi

Singho and therefore, the Plaintiff-Respondents pedigree is challenged on the

basis that Patikiri Arachchige Punchi Singho had seven children and not six as

revealed in the Plaint and the name of Patikiri Arachchige Amarasena has been

completely left out from the Plaint.

P a g e 8 | 15

As noted earlier, Deed No. 2690 from which the Defendant-Appellant claims title to

her land, makes no reference to the said Plan No. 1705 dated 30/11/1973. In evidence,

the Defendant-Appellant states that the said plan was made after the land was purchased

by the said Deed No. 2690. It is claimed that the fence depicted in the said Plan No.

1705 is the same fence shown in the Preliminary Plan No. 1175/P, and that the said

fence was in existence for over 20 years by which prescriptive rights were acquired

over Lot 3 of Plan No. 1175/P.

However, based on Plan No. 849/P dated 26/07/1957, produced in the District Court

Case No. 4095/P, the Plaintiff-Respondent denies the above position on the basis that

in 1957, there was no fence across Lot 4, and therefore, not seen in the said Plan No.

849/P.

The land to be partitioned was shown by the parties to the surveyor, and the Preliminary

Plan No. 1175/P was prepared by superimposing Lot 4 of Plan No. 849/P. Surveyor

A.C.P. Gunasena was not called to give evidence. However, according to the surveyor

report dated 15/09/1998, the Defendant Appellant has been in possession of 00.26P

towards the western boundary of Lot 4 of Plan No. 849/P. The said report also speaks

of a fence in existence, as claimed by the Defendant Appellant. It is claimed that putting

up of the fence had been the cause for dispute between the parties. However, it is

pertinent to note that, there is no fence depicted in Plan No. 849/P.

Now I will deal with the question, whether the Defendant-Appellant was allocated

shares according to inheritance under the pedigree and the evidence led at the trial.

It was the contention of the Plaintiff-Respondent that the Deeds submitted by the

Defendant-Appellant claiming title to 95P does not relate to the land in question but

another land, and therefore is not entitled to an extent of 95P of the corpus, but in fact

P a g e 9 | 15

is entitled only to half share, the remaining half of Lot 3 in Plan No. 1175/P, as

mentioned above.

As observed earlier, Patikiri Arachchige Andi Singo and Patikiri Arachchige Simon

Singho were the original co-owners of the land to be partitioned, each entitled to half

share of an undivided land. It is undisputed that the said original owners possessed half

share each of the said land depicted as Lot 3 in Plan No. 1175/P, dated 30/11/1973.

Patikiri Arachchige Simon Singho, by Deed No. 15767 dated 17/01/1945 (P2),

transferred his half share to Patikiri Arachchige Punchi Singho. Punchi Singho died

intestate leaving his wife, Mahavithanage Helenahami, and 7 children.

As noted earlier the Defendant-Appellant questions the inheritance under the pedigree

of the Plaintiff-Respondent on the basis that Mahavithanage Helenahami had seven

children and not 6 namely, Sriyawathie, Chandradasa, Dayarathna, Dharmasena,

Steven, Senevirathne, and Amarasena. It is contended that Amarasena is not disclosed

in the Plaint as one of the children of Helenahami.

The Plaintiff-Respondents position is that the said Helenahami and Dayaratna

transferred their rights to the Plaintiff-Respondent by Deed No. 23247 dated

02/04/1980, marked P3. Senevirathne died issueless, restoring his inherited rights

back to his mother Helenahami and by Deed No. 194 dated 01/02/1997, marked P5,

the said Helenahami and Sriyawathie transferred their rights to the Plaintiff-

Respondent. Dayarathna, Dharmasena, and Steven have also transferred their rights to

the Plaintiff-Respondent by Deed No. 24132 dated 13/02/1981 marked P4.

Amarasena and Chandrasdasa transferred their rights by Deed Nos. 24168 dated

27/02/1981 marked P6, and Deed No. 24277 dated 28/03/1981 marked P8,

respectively, in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent. Sriyawathie transferred her rights

to the Plaintiff-Respondent by Deed No. 25483 dated 05/06/1982, marked P7.

P a g e 10 | 15

Accordingly, by the said Deeds, the Plaintiff-Respondent claims to have acquired the

rights to the land from the said Helenahami and her children.

The dispute regarding the number of children Helenahami had surfaced in evidence

given by the Defendant-Appellant. As mentioned earlier, it was claimed that Punchi

Singho and Helenahami had 7 children and not 6, namely, Sriyawathie, Chandradasa,

Dayarathna, Dharmasena, Steven, Senevirathne, and Amarasena. The Civil Appeal

High Court in its Judgement dated 26/08/2013, dealt with the said issue in the following

manner.

It refers to Patikiri Arachchige Amarasena as the Vender and he alienated the

rights derived from Punchi Singho as paternal inheritance. The quibble of the

Defendant is that the name Amarasena is not referred to in the plaint. In those

circumstances, though the Plaintiff does not refer to seven children of the said

Punchi Singho there is no doubt that the Plaintiff has purchased rights of 7 children

of Punchi Singho and his wife.

Both parties admitted that the land depicted in Plan No. 1175/P is the land sought to be

partitioned. As noted earlier, Sriyawathie and Helenahami transferred their rights by

Deed No. 194 dated 01/02/1997, to the Plaintiff-Respondent. It is also observed that

Sriyawathie, by Deed No. 25483 dated 05/06/1982, marked P7 had independently

transferred her rights to the Plaintiff-Respondent. However, Sriyawathie could not have

transferred any right in excess of what she inherited through Helenahami. Therefore, it

is safe to conclude that in any event, by the said Deed No. 25483, anything in excess of

half share of the corpus would not have transferred to the Plaintiff-Respondent.

Furthermore, the said Deeds were produced in evidence at the trial without a contest,

which makes the Plaintiff-Respondents claim that both parties to this action were

equally entitled to half share each, that much stronger. Therefore, through the said

P a g e 11 | 15

documents, the Plaintiff-Respondent has clearly established inheritance under the

pedigree acquiring the rights of all 7 children of Punchi Singho and his wife

Helenahami.

Therefore, the Civil Appeal High Court was correct in deciding that, after the death of

Punchi Singho his rights devolved on Helenahami and their seven children.

For all the reasons stated above, I am of the view that the Plaintiff-Respondent

purchased half share of an undivided land from the Plaintiff-Respondents predecessors

in title.

On this issue, the District Court and the Civil Appeal High Court were of the same view

that the Plaintiff-Respondent had purchased all the rights of Helenahami and her seven

children. Having considered the evidence placed before Court, I do not see any reason

to disturb the said findings.

Therefore, I answer the 1st question of law in the affirmative.

Accordingly, the 2nd question of law on which leave to appeal to this Court has been

granted need not be considered.

The Defendant-Appellant tendered in evidence Deed No. 2690 dated 01/06/1973, as

V1, Deed No. 14288 dated 22/03/1971, as V2, Deed No. 952 dated 06/04/1964, as

V3, to establish inheritance under the pedigree from Patikiri Arachchige Andi Singo.

The Defendant-Appellant claims title to a portion in extent 95P by Deed No. 2690 dated

01/06/1973, marked V1 (the said claim is not supported by the said Deed No. 2690).

Plan No. 1705 dated 30/11/1973 marked V4, shows the total extent of land in Lot 4

as 95P. In evidence before the District Court, the Defendant-Appellant stated that by

Deed No 14288, a divided portion in extent, 2R 15P was transferred to her in 1973, and

during that time the Defendant-Appellant with the consent of the Plaintiff-Respondent

P a g e 12 | 15

had put up a barbed wire fence to demarcate the boundary line between Lots 1 and 3 of

Preliminary Plan No. 1705. It is observed that by the said Deed No. 14288, the

Defendant-Appellant was entitled to an undivided portion of land in extent 2R 15P of

a larger land, approximately in extent of 2A.

At the commencement of the trial both parties admitted that the land to be partitioned

is depicted in Plan No. 1175/P, more fully described in the schedule to the Plaint.

Therefore, the question arises as to whether the land described in Deeds marked V1,

V2, and V3 and the said Plan No. 849/P dated 26/07/1957, produced in evidence in

the District Court Case No. 4095/P, relate to the same land that is sought to be

partitioned. The documents submitted by the Defendant-Appellant refers to a land in

extent of 2A. However, according to the final decree based on the previous partition

Plan No 849/P, filed of record in the District Court Gampaha Case No. 4095/P, the

extent of land to be partitioned, in the instant action, is in extent, 1A and 6P, which is

evidenced by document marked P9. Even though the Defendant-Appellant claims that

a lawful consideration was paid for 95P, and therefore is entitled to a portion in excess

of half share, in evidence in examination in chief, the Defendant-Appellant was not

certain of the extent of land which she claims and thereby failed to justify such claim.

In that context, it is important to note the learned District Judges observation that the

schedules to the survey plans submitted by the Defendant-Appellant too, does not

identify the corpus sufficiently and therefore failed to prove the extent of land, as

claimed.

It is also noted that the Deeds marked V1, V2, and V3 relied upon by the

Defendant-Appellant in order to prove entitlement in excess of a half share, does not

sufficiently indicate a precise extent of land, as claimed by the Defendant-Appellant.

Accordingly, the findings of the learned District Judge and the Civil Appeal High Court,

P a g e 13 | 15

to the effect that the existence of a discrepancy in the extents given in the documents

relied upon by the Defendant-Appellant, cannot be faulted.

In the said background, it was the contention of the Plaintiff-Respondent that the Deeds

submitted by the Defendant-Appellant claiming title to 95P from an undivided potion

of land does not relate to the corpus sought to be partitioned and therefore the

Defendant-Appellant is not entitled to an extent of 95P, but in fact is entitled only to a

half share, which is the remaining half of Lot 3 of Plan No. 1175/P.

Therefore, from the documents tendered to Court and for the reasons stated above, I am

of the view that the Defendant-Appellant is entitled only to a half share of the land, that

is the remaining half of Lot 3 in Plan No. 1175/P.

The Plaintiff-Respondent has also made extensive submissions in this regard, in the

written submissions filed in this Court, that the relief sought by the Defendant-

Appellant is untenable in Law, with which I agree.

Therefore, the 3rd question of law is answered in the affirmative.

Apart from the three questions on which leave to appeal to this Court have been granted,

it was also the contention of the Defendant-Appellant, that the Civil Appeal High Court

disregarded her claim on prescriptive rights. She claims that the said prescriptive rights

are based on an identifiable fence depicted in Plan No. 1705 dated 14/10/1973, also

visible in the preliminary Plan No. 1175/P dated 30/07/1998, which she claims to be in

existence for the past 20 years. The Defendant-Appellant contends that she obtained the

consent of Helenahami to construct the said fence and thereby has prescribed to the said

portion of land in Lot 3 in the said Plan No. 1175/P.

The said stand is totally denied by the Plaintiff-Respondent.

P a g e 14 | 15

In the written submissions, dated the 15/06/2023, the Plaintiff-Respondent refers to the

case of Corea Vs. Appuhamy, a Judgment delivered by the Privy Council reported in

(1911) 15 NLR 65, which states in the head note that-

A co-owners possession is in law the possession of his co-owners. It is not possible

for him to put an end to that possession by any secret intention in his mind. Nothing

short of ouster or something equivalent to ouster could bring about that result.

In Sirajudeen and two others vs. Abbas (1994) 2 SLR 365, G.P.S. De Silva C.J. stated;

as regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements

of witnesses that the Plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for a number of years

exceeding the prescriptive period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse

possession necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the

witnesses should speak to specific facts and the question of possession has to be

decided by thereupon by Court

In the course of the Judgment in this case, the Supreme Court observed that this

principle was best stated in the words of Gratiaen J. in Chelliah Vs. Wijenathan 54

NLR 337 in the following terms.

where a party invokes the provisions of Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in

order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the

burden of proof rests squirely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his

or her acquisition of prescriptive rights

In view of the above and from what has been stated earlier in this Judgement, it is clear

that in order to prove prescriptive title, the Defendant-Appellant has failed to fulfill the

obligations and duties in duly discharging the burden of proof, in order to set up an

P a g e 15 | 15

uninterrupted and an adverse possession against the Plaintiff-Respondent by necessary

evidence and therefore has failed to establish prescriptive title.

In these reasons, the Judgement dated 24/09/2008 of the Additional District Judge and

the Judgement dated 26/08/2013, of the Civil Appeal High Court are hereby affirmed

and this Appeal is dismissed. No order for Costs.
