"As noted earlier, Deed No. 2690 from which the Defendant-Appellant claims title to"
"her land, makes no reference to the said Plan No. 1705 dated 30/11/1973. In evidence,"
"the Defendant-Appellant states that the said plan was made after the land was purchased"
"by the said Deed No. 2690. It is claimed that the fence depicted in the said Plan No."
"1705 is the same fence shown in the Preliminary Plan No. 1175/P, and that the said"
"fence  was  in  existence  for  over  20  years  by  which  prescriptive  rights  were  acquired"
"over Lot 3 of Plan No. 1175/P."
"However, based on Plan No. 849/P dated 26/07/1957, produced in the District Court"
"Case No. 4095/P, the Plaintiff-Respondent denies the above position on the basis that"
"in 1957, there was no fence across Lot 4, and therefore, not seen in the said Plan No."
"849/P."
"The land to be partitioned was shown by the parties to the surveyor, and the Preliminary"
"Plan No. 1175/P was prepared by superimposing Lot 4 of Plan No. 849/P. Surveyor"
"A.C.P. Gunasena was not called to give evidence. However, according to the surveyor"
"report  dated  15/09/1998,  the  Defendant  Appellant  has  been  in  possession  of  00.26P"
"towards the western boundary of Lot 4 of Plan No. 849/P. The said report also speaks"
"of a fence in existence, as claimed by the Defendant Appellant. It is claimed that putting"
"up  of  the  fence  had  been  the  cause  for  dispute  between  the  parties.  However,  it  is"
"pertinent to note that, there is no fence depicted in Plan No. 849/P."
"Now  I  will  deal  with  the  question,  whether  the  Defendant-Appellant  was  allocated"
"shares according to inheritance under the pedigree and the evidence led at the trial."
"It  was  the  contention  of  the  Plaintiff-Respondent  that  the  Deeds  submitted  by  the"
"Defendant-Appellant claiming title to 95P does not relate to the land in question but"
"another land, and therefore is not entitled to an extent of 95P of the corpus, but in fact"
