"Preliminary  Plan  No.  1705.  It  is  observed  that  by  the  said  Deed  No.  14288,  the"
"Defendant-Appellant was entitled to an undivided portion of land in extent 2R 15P of"
"a larger land, approximately in extent of 2A."
"At the commencement of the trial both parties admitted that the land to be partitioned"
"is  depicted  in  Plan  No.  1175/P,  more  fully  described  in  the  schedule  to  the  Plaint."
