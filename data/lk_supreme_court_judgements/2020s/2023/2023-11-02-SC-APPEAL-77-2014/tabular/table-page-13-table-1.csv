"to the effect that the existence of a discrepancy in the extents given in the documents"
"relied upon by the Defendant-Appellant, cannot be faulted."
"In the said background, it was the contention of the Plaintiff-Respondent that the Deeds"
"submitted by the Defendant-Appellant claiming title to 95P from an undivided potion"
"of  land  does  not  relate  to  the  corpus  sought  to  be  partitioned  and  therefore  the"
"Defendant-Appellant is not entitled to an extent of 95P, but in fact is entitled only to a"
"half share, which is the remaining half of Lot 3 of Plan No. 1175/P."
"Therefore, from the documents tendered to Court and for the reasons stated above, I am"
"of the view that the Defendant-Appellant is entitled only to a half share of the land, that"
"is the remaining half of Lot 3 in Plan No. 1175/P."
"The  Plaintiff-Respondent  has  also  made  extensive  submissions  in  this  regard,  in  the"
"written  submissions  filed  in  this  Court,  that  the  relief  sought  by  the  Defendant-"
"Appellant is untenable in Law, with which I agree."
"Therefore, the 3rd question of law is answered in the affirmative."
"Apart from the three questions on which leave to appeal to this Court have been granted,"
"it was also the contention of the Defendant-Appellant, that the Civil Appeal High Court"
"disregarded her claim on prescriptive rights. She claims that the said prescriptive rights"
"are based on an identifiable fence  depicted in Plan No. 1705  dated  14/10/1973, also"
"visible in the preliminary Plan No. 1175/P dated 30/07/1998, which she claims to be in"
"existence for the past 20 years. The Defendant-Appellant contends that she obtained the"
"consent of Helenahami to construct the said fence and thereby has prescribed to the said"
"portion of land in Lot 3 in the said Plan No. 1175/P."
"The said stand is totally denied by the Plaintiff-Respondent."
