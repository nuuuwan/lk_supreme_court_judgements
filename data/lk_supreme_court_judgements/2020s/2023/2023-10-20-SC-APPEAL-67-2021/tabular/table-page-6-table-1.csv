"Conversely, the Defendant denied these averments made by the Plaint, stating that"
"she did not intend to terminate the matrimonial relationship, and is, in fact, inclined to"
"resume said matrimonial life with the Plaintiff, but on the condition that this is done"
"so at any place except the Plaintiff’s parental house. The Defendant has testified that"
"the  impetus  for  this  condition  is  alleged  mistreatment  by  the  Plaintiff’s  family,  in"
"particular his sister, at the matrimonial home in Seychelles (page 85 of the Appeal Brief"
"marked “X”). According to the Defendant, the Plaintiff’s sister attempted to confine the"
"Defendant  in  the  matrimonial  house  in  Seychelles  to  prevent  her  from  visiting  the"
"Plaintiff’s  workplace  and,  as  a  result,  the  Defendant  contends  to  possessing  legal"
"justification  for  not  being  inclined  to  resume  marital  life  at  the  Plaintiff’s  parental"
"house."
"What  does  seem  to  be  apparent,  however,  is  that  the  above-mentioned  incident"
"appears to align with the Plaintiff’s account of the commotion incited by the Defendant"
"at his workplace."
"On behalf of the Plaintiff, he and his father gave evidence. On behalf of the Defendant,"
"the Defendant gave evidence, and no witnesses were called."
"Analysis"
"Section 19(1) of the Marriage Registration Ordinance No. 19 of 1907, as amended, lists"
"“malicious desertion” as one of the three grounds upon which a decree of divorce  a"
"vinculo matrimonii may be entered by a competent Court. This form of desertion may"
"manifest  either  as  simple  malicious  desertion  (sometimes  called  actual  malicious"
"desertion) or by way of constructive malicious desertion."
"The  Marriage  Registration  Ordinance  does  not  explicitly  define  the  term  “malicious"
"desertion”  employed  in  Section  19(2)  of  that  enactment.  Consequently,  one  has  to"
"peruse past decisions of the Courts to determine the constituent elements requisite"
"for establishing grounds for divorce based on malicious desertion."
