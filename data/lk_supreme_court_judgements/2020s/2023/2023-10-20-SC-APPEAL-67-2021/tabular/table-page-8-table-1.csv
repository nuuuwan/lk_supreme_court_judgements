"The term “consortium” is taken to be synonymous with “cohabitation” used in Poyser"
"J’s statement in Attanayake v Attanayake (supra) referred to above. Furthermore,"
"Jayawardena J drew upon the elucidation of ""consortium"" as propounded by Harcourt"
"J in Grobbelaar vs. Havenga (1964 S SALR (N) 522):"
"""An  abstraction  comprising  the 
totality  of  a  number  of  rights,  duties  and"
"advantages 
accruing 
to 
spouses 
of 
a  marriage… 
[which 
embraces]"
"companionship, love, affection, comfort, mutual services, sexual intercourse - all"
"belong to the married state. Taken together, they make up the consortium.”"
"In Rajeswararanee vs. Sunthararasa (64 NLR 366), Basanayake CJ stipulated that,"
"with regard to the first requirement of the factum of desertion, the desertion must be"
"“against the desire” of the deserted spouse."
"Sinha  J,  in  Bipinchandra  Jaisinghbhai  Shah  vs.  Prabhavati  (supra),  stated  as"
"follows:"
"“Two elements are essential so far as the deserted spouse is concerned: (1) the"
"absence of consent, and (2) absence of conduct giving reasonable cause to the"
"spouse leaving the matrimonial home to form the necessary intention aforesaid."
"The petitioner for divorce bears the burden of proving those elements in the two"
"spouses respectively.”"
"It is, therefore, evident that in cases involving simple malicious desertion, the factum"
"of  desertion 
is  substantiated  when 
the  spouse  accused  of  malicious  desertion"
"deliberately and without sufficient cause, physically leaves the matrimonial home or"
"ceases cohabitation against the wishes of the deserted spouse."
"The  Defendant  contended  that  the  Plaintiff  failed  to  establish  that  she 
left  the"
"matrimonial  home 
in  Seychelles  as  they  both 
left  Seychelles 
jointly  and  arrived"
"together 
in  Sri  Lanka 
in  October  2011. 
In  application  of  the  above-established"
