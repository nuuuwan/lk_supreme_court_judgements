"2010, the Defendant followed suit, and together, they established their matrimonial"
"home in Seychelles."
"The Plaintiff further contended that in the ensuing period between August 2010 and"
"October  2011,  there  was  a  gradual  breakdown  of  the  marriage  attributable  to  the"
"Defendant’s conduct.  The Plaintiff highlighted a  series of incidents: the Defendant's"
"unfounded  suspicions,  escalating  quarrels,  and  disparaging  conduct  towards  the"
"Plaintiff's friends and family, which allegedly culminated in emotional detachment and"
"disruption of the Plaintiff's professional life. The Plaintiff posits the age disparity and"
"religious divergence as contributing factors to the discord."
"A specific incident of note (pages 81 and 84 of the Appeal Brief marked “X”) involves"
"an alleged visit by the Defendant to the Plaintiff's workplace, during which she caused"
"a commotion that rendered an impossible work environment for the Plaintiff."
"Notably, the Plaintiff and the Defendant frequently shuttled between Seychelles and"
"Sri Lanka during their matrimonial journey. For instance, in October 2010, the Plaintiff"
"and the Defendant returned to Sri Lanka and temporarily resided at the Defendant's"
"parental home. The Plaintiff subsequently returned to Seychelles in late October 2010,"
"with the Defendant joining him approximately a month later."
"However, in October 2011, following an extended period of discord, the Plaintiff and"
"the  Defendant  returned  to  Sri  Lanka  together.  Upon  arrival  at  the  airport,  the"
"Defendant chose to depart with her parents. Since October 2011, the Plaintiff and the"
"Defendant  have  maintained  separate  residences,  marking  a  decisive  cessation  of"
"conjugal  cohabitation.  This  act  of  separation  constitutes  the  basis  for  the  Plaintiff's"
"claim of malicious desertion against the Defendant."
"The Plaintiff asserted that, during the period from October 2011 to the initiation of"
"these proceedings, the Plaintiff took proactive steps, with the support of his parents,"
"to  invite  the  Defendant  to  resume  marital  life,  which  the  Defendant  had  allegedly"
"refused."
