S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

In the matter before this Court, the Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent, namely Abdul

Kareem Nizar (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff), brought forth a petition for the

dissolution of his marriage with the Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner, namely Inoka

Uthpalani Kaluarachchie (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant), praying for a

decree of divorce a vinculo matrimonii on grounds of malicious desertion by the

Defendant in the District Court of Kandy. The District Court, through its judgment

rendered on 4th March 2017, adjudged that the Plaintiff had failed to substantiate the

charge of malicious desertion and accordingly dismissed the Plaintiff's claim.

Subsequently, the High Court of Civil Appeal of the Central Province Holden in Kandy,

by Judgment dated 11th December 2020, held in favour of the Plaintiff and overturned

the decision of the District Court.

The Defendant, aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, has now sought

recourse from this Court, lodging an appeal by way of Petition dated 13th January 2021,

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 15

praying that the High Court's Judgment be set aside, and the District Court's Judgment

be reinstated.

Upon the presentation of the instant case before this Court on 16th July 2021, leave to

appeal was granted on the following question of law:

(i) Did the Civil Appellate High Court misdirect themselves that the evidence led

by the Respondent amounts to malicious desertion?

The question of law set out above requires this Court to examine the evidence

proffered before the District Court and subsequently determine whether the learned

High Court Judges rightly diverged from the view taken by the learned District Court

Judge in determining that the Plaintiff had satisfactorily established the culpability of

the Defendant for malicious desertion.

Factual Matrix

The narrative of this case unfolds against the backdrop of a marriage between the

Plaintiff and the Defendant on 31st January 2010. The Plaintiff is the husband, and the

Defendant is the wife. No children were born of the marriage. Further, the Defendant

surpasses the Plaintiff in age by seven years, and their affiliation to different religious

faiths, Islam for the Plaintiff and Roman Catholic for the Defendant, underscores their

diverse backgrounds. The registration of the marriage transpired without the

knowledge of the Plaintiff's parents, primarily due to apprehensions stemming from

their divergent religious affiliations. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff avers that, over time, his

parents came to accept the marriage, even bestowing gold ornaments upon the

Defendant as a symbol of their approval, a fact which is undisputed by the Defendant.

It is to be noted that on examination of the testimony, disparities exist in the

chronology of events as recounted by both parties. The Plaintiff, employed within the

hospitality industry in Sri Lanka at the time of the marriage, averred that he travelled

to Seychelles in search of a new job in February 2010. Six months hence, in August

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 5 of 15

2010, the Defendant followed suit, and together, they established their matrimonial

home in Seychelles.

The Plaintiff further contended that in the ensuing period between August 2010 and

October 2011, there was a gradual breakdown of the marriage attributable to the

Defendants conduct. The Plaintiff highlighted a series of incidents: the Defendant's

unfounded suspicions, escalating quarrels, and disparaging conduct towards the

Plaintiff's friends and family, which allegedly culminated in emotional detachment and

disruption of the Plaintiff's professional life. The Plaintiff posits the age disparity and

religious divergence as contributing factors to the discord.

A specific incident of note (pages 81 and 84 of the Appeal Brief marked X) involves

an alleged visit by the Defendant to the Plaintiff's workplace, during which she caused

a commotion that rendered an impossible work environment for the Plaintiff.

Notably, the Plaintiff and the Defendant frequently shuttled between Seychelles and

Sri Lanka during their matrimonial journey. For instance, in October 2010, the Plaintiff

and the Defendant returned to Sri Lanka and temporarily resided at the Defendant's

parental home. The Plaintiff subsequently returned to Seychelles in late October 2010,

with the Defendant joining him approximately a month later.

However, in October 2011, following an extended period of discord, the Plaintiff and

the Defendant returned to Sri Lanka together. Upon arrival at the airport, the

Defendant chose to depart with her parents. Since October 2011, the Plaintiff and the

Defendant have maintained separate residences, marking a decisive cessation of

conjugal cohabitation. This act of separation constitutes the basis for the Plaintiff's

claim of malicious desertion against the Defendant.

The Plaintiff asserted that, during the period from October 2011 to the initiation of

these proceedings, the Plaintiff took proactive steps, with the support of his parents,

to invite the Defendant to resume marital life, which the Defendant had allegedly

refused.

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 15

Conversely, the Defendant denied these averments made by the Plaint, stating that

she did not intend to terminate the matrimonial relationship, and is, in fact, inclined to

resume said matrimonial life with the Plaintiff, but on the condition that this is done

so at any place except the Plaintiffs parental house. The Defendant has testified that

the impetus for this condition is alleged mistreatment by the Plaintiffs family, in

particular his sister, at the matrimonial home in Seychelles (page 85 of the Appeal Brief

marked X). According to the Defendant, the Plaintiffs sister attempted to confine the

Defendant in the matrimonial house in Seychelles to prevent her from visiting the

Plaintiffs workplace and, as a result, the Defendant contends to possessing legal

justification for not being inclined to resume marital life at the Plaintiffs parental

house.

What does seem to be apparent, however, is that the above-mentioned incident

appears to align with the Plaintiffs account of the commotion incited by the Defendant

at his workplace.

On behalf of the Plaintiff, he and his father gave evidence. On behalf of the Defendant,

the Defendant gave evidence, and no witnesses were called.

Analysis

Section 19(1) of the Marriage Registration Ordinance No. 19 of 1907, as amended, lists

malicious desertion as one of the three grounds upon which a decree of divorce a

vinculo matrimonii may be entered by a competent Court. This form of desertion may

manifest either as simple malicious desertion (sometimes called actual malicious

desertion) or by way of constructive malicious desertion.

The Marriage Registration Ordinance does not explicitly define the term malicious

desertion employed in Section 19(2) of that enactment. Consequently, one has to

peruse past decisions of the Courts to determine the constituent elements requisite

for establishing grounds for divorce based on malicious desertion.

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 15

In Attanayake vs. Attanayake 16 Cey L. R. 206, Poyser J identified the two pivotal

elements necessary to establish malicious desertion as follows:

In order to constitute desertion, there must be cessation of cohabitation and an

intention on the part of the accused party to desert the other.

This fundamental premise was affirmed by Sinha J in Bipinchandra Jaisinghbhai

Shah vs. Prabhavati (AIR 1957 SC 176), wherein the learned Judge stated:

"For the offence of desertion, so far as the deserting spouse is concerned, two

essential conditions must be there, namely (1) the factum of separation, and (2)

the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi).

It has to be borne in mind that what constitutes malicious desertion invariably hinges

upon the specifics of each case, as articulated by Jayawardena J in Gomes vs. Gomes

(S.C. Appeal No. 123/14 by minutes dated 07th June 2018):

The question of whether the elements required to constitute malicious desertion

have been established in a particular case are questions of fact to be decided by

the Court upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case.

This is especially pertinent because, as observed by Sir Henry Duke (later Lord

Merrivale P.), in Pulford vs. Pulford (1923 Probate 18):

"Desertion is not the withdrawal from a place but from a state of things".

Factum of Separation

In the case of Gomes v Gomes (supra), Jayawardena J stated as follows:

Simple malicious desertion or, as it is sometimes called, actual malicious

desertion is where the spouse who is alleged to be guilty of malicious desertion

physically separates from the matrimonial home or terminates matrimonial

consortium, with the intention of deserting his or her spouse. The term

"consortium" usually denotes the composite incidents of a marital relationship.

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 15

[Emphasis added]

The term consortium is taken to be synonymous with cohabitation used in Poyser

Js statement in Attanayake v Attanayake (supra) referred to above. Furthermore,

Jayawardena J drew upon the elucidation of "consortium" as propounded by Harcourt

J in Grobbelaar vs. Havenga (1964 S SALR (N) 522):

"An abstraction comprising the totality of a number of rights, duties and

advantages accruing to spouses of a marriage [which embraces]

companionship, love, affection, comfort, mutual services, sexual intercourse - all

belong to the married state. Taken together, they make up the consortium.

In Rajeswararanee vs. Sunthararasa (64 NLR 366), Basanayake CJ stipulated that,

with regard to the first requirement of the factum of desertion, the desertion must be

against the desire of the deserted spouse.

Sinha J, in Bipinchandra Jaisinghbhai Shah vs. Prabhavati (supra), stated as

follows:

Two elements are essential so far as the deserted spouse is concerned: (1) the

absence of consent, and (2) absence of conduct giving reasonable cause to the

spouse leaving the matrimonial home to form the necessary intention aforesaid.

The petitioner for divorce bears the burden of proving those elements in the two

spouses respectively.

It is, therefore, evident that in cases involving simple malicious desertion, the factum

of desertion is substantiated when the spouse accused of malicious desertion

deliberately and without sufficient cause, physically leaves the matrimonial home or

ceases cohabitation against the wishes of the deserted spouse.

The Defendant contended that the Plaintiff failed to establish that she left the

matrimonial home in Seychelles as they both left Seychelles jointly and arrived

together in Sri Lanka in October 2011. In application of the above-established

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 9 of 15

principles to the instant case, however, the Defendants choice to depart with her

parents in October 2011, and thereby cease co-habitation with the Plaintiff, constitutes

the initial requirement, i.e., the factum of desertion, requisite to establishing malicious

desertion. On the face of the evidence presented to the District Court, in my view, the

Plaintiff substantiates his claim that this separation was against his consent and

willingness. Furthermore, it is important to note that between the period from October

2011 to the institution of legal proceedings, and up until present day, the Plaintiff and

the Defendant have not lived together.

Animus Deserendi

In Perera v Gajaweera (2005 1 SLR 103), Wimalachandra J observed that establishing

malicious desertion necessitates demonstrating:

...not only the factum of the desertion but also the required animus to repudiate

the marital relationship.

In Silva v Missinona (26 NLR 113), Bertram CJ defined this concept as follows:

Deliberate and unconscientious, definite, and final repudiation of the obligations

of the marriage state.

He further added that the desertion must be sine animo revertendi, signifying that

the deserting spouse must harbour no intention to resume the marriage.

Similarly, in the cases Goonerwardene v Wickremensinghe (34 NLR 5), Garvin SPJ

opines:

It must be of such a character as would justify the inference that the spouse who

is alleged to have deserted the other did so deliberately and with the intention of

repudiating the marriage state.

In English case of Buchler v Buchler [1947 1 AER 319], Lord Greene MR stated:

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 10 of 15

In the case of actual desertion the mere act of one spouse in leaving the

matrimonial home will in general make the inference an easy one.

Consequently, the mere act of the Defendant discontinuing cohabitation serves as a

sufficient foundation for inferring animus deserendi.

The Defendants intention to desert the Plaintiff is further underscored by her refusal

to recommence the marital life at the Plaintiff's parental house, citing mistreatment by

the Plaintiff's family, which has led to her reluctance to reside in a place where she

perceives a threat of confinement.

As articulated by Sinha J in Bipinchandra Jaisinghbhai Shah vs. Prabhavati (supra),

a spouse charged with simple malicious desertion may counter such charge by

establishing that he or she was justified in leaving the marital home or ceasing

cohabitation because he or she was given sufficient cause to do so by the other spouse.

Dalton ACJ reflects this limitation in Ramalingam v Ramalingam (35 NLR 174),

where the learned judge declared:

If a woman left her husband finally, against his will, and without legal

justification, her desertion would in law be malicious.

H.N.G Fernando J, as he was then, employed similar views in in Ariyapala v Ariyapala

(65 NLR 453 at p.454).

Counsel for the Defendant invoked the case of Ramalingam v Ramalingam (supra)

to establish that the Defendant possessed lawful justification for not residing in the

Plaintiff's parental home due to fears of potential confinement.

The learned High Court Judges make reference to these averments in their verdict and

state that by the Defendants own testimony, where she alleges that the Plaintiff's sister

endeavoured to confine her within the matrimonial residence in Seychelles to prevent

her from causing disruptions at the Plaintiff's workplace (page 85 of the Appeal Brief

marked X), confirms that such incidents caused by the Defendant have occurred in

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 11 of 15

the past. The learned High Court Judges further state that no police report or similar

corroborative evidence attesting to such an incident involving the Plaintiff's sister was

presented by the Defendant.

I am inclined to concur with the learned High Court Judges inferences and,

consequently, hold that the Defendants desertion of the Plaintiff lacks legal

justification and is, therefore, characterized by malicious intent.

Another facet to consider is the Plaintiffs averments that he entreated the Defendant

to resume marital life before initiating legal proceedings in this Court.

In Muthukumarasamy vs. Parameshwary (78 NLR 488) Sharvananda J, as he then

was, stated:

"Termination of desertion can take place by a supervening animus revertendi

coupled with a bona fide approach to the deserted spouse with a view to

resumption of life together... The refusal of a defendant's bona fide offer to return

which the plaintiff had no right to refuse converted the plaintiff into the deserting

party and the plaintiff thereafter became the deserter and rendered himself guilty

of malicious desertion."

Similar views were taken in Canekaratne v Canekaratne (66 NLR 380) by Sasoni J:

It should also be remembered that a spouse may offer to resume cohabitation

after a separation has taken place, but it is for the Court to decide whether the

offer is genuine. It is only genuine if there is a fixed and settled intention to offer

a resumption of marital life under reasonable conditions; and it will not be a fixed

and settled intention if it is a mere fluctuating desire to resume cohabitation.

When either spouse has made such an offer, a rejection of it by the other will turn

him or her into a deserter.

This was affirmed by Jayawardena J in Gomes v Gomes (supra), where he observed:

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 12 of 15

A desertion may end if, before the deserted spouse commences an action praying

for a divorce on the ground of malicious desertion, the deserting spouse reconciles

and returns to the matrimonial home or resumes cohabitation or makes a bona

fide offer to do so. Further, an unreasonable refusal of such an offer by the

erstwhile deserted spouse may, in some circumstances, turn the tables and make

the erstwhile deserted spouse a deserting spouse.

The learned High Court Judges have referred to the Plaintiffs testimony that he, with

the support of his parents, proactively sought the Defendant to resume marital life,

which the Defendant allegedly declined. This submission is corroborated by the

evidence submitted by the Plaintiffs father. The High Court Judges further referenced

the Defendants assertion that she has always acted with the sole purpose of

maintaining marital life with the Plaintiff, yet, the learned Judges observed, she failed

to exhibit any concrete positive steps or initiatives post-October 2011 to resume

marital life.

In light of these aforementioned facts and circumstances, I discern no valid grounds

to take a different view than that of the learned High Court Judges. The Defendant's

claims of making multiple offers to recommence marital life do not appear genuine,

particularly due to the absence of evidence to corroborate that these offers were made

before the Plaintiff instituted legal proceedings.

Therefore, I am inclined to endorse the position taken by the learned High Court

Judges, which entails setting aside the District Court's judgment and affirming that,

based on the evidence presented before the District Court, the Plaintiff has

satisfactorily proven that the Defendant is guilty of malicious desertion.

At this juncture, it is imperative to underscore that I am cognizant of the conventional

understanding that marriage is not only a union of two individuals but also an

amalgamation of two families and their respective cultural bonds, inevitably

intertwined when two individuals enter into matrimony. This perspective finds

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 13 of 15

reflection in the law; the legal framework governing divorce in Sri Lanka, as embodied

in the Marriage Registration Ordinance of 1907 and heavily influenced by pre-existing

Roman-Dutch and English legal systems, is premised on the notion that marriage is a

lifelong commitment that can only be dissolved upon on proof of serious matrimonial

fault. This underscores the law's aversion to marital dissolution and its preference for

the preservation of conjugal ties, even in the face of life's trials and tribulations.

In Silva v Missonona (supra), Bertram CJ refers to the following principle adopted in

the South African case of Gibbon v Gibbon (1 2 E.D.C. 284), per Shippard J:

The theory of the Roman-Dutch law appears to have been that divorce should

never be granted while there remains a hope of reconciliation.

However, the law and its application must evolve in conjunction with the shifting tides

of societal mores and perspectives. Especially when drawing focus upon newer

generations, it is hardly a need to say that venerable concepts such as education,

financial independence, and gender roles in the context of marriage have transformed

since the enactment of the Marriage Registration Ordinance in 1907, influenced partly

by the cultures of Western societies. To a large extent, the current law remains

unreformed and is, in several notable ways, incompatible with modern notions relating

to marriage.

With this in mind, I allude back to Harcourt J's definition of the word "consortium" in

Grobbelaar v Havenga (supra). On observation of this instant case, there is an

evident absence of an abstraction encompassing companionship, love and affection,

among other elements, within the marital relationship between the Plaintiff and the

Defendant. Most importantly, I find a palpable absence of hope, replaced by a

discernible withdrawal from a state of things amounting to desertion, as elucidated

by Sir Henry Duke (later Lord Merrivale P.), in Pulford vs. Pulford (supra). As stated

above, notwithstanding the absence of any reservations in law about cohabitation

during divorce proceedings, I do not observe any instances or even genuine attempts

SC Appeal 67/2021 JUDGMENT Page 14 of 15

at resuming marital life in the period between the institution of this action and the

present day.

In fact, there is a striking observation in the Plaintiffs evidence: he testifies that he

found the Defendants behaviour so intolerable that,

. .

.

An approximate and unofficial translation of the above reads as follows:

Making a decision is challenging for me. I came because I could not be patient

any longer. Later, I was afraid that if I went with her, I would cause harm to her.

In the face of such circumstances, I am of the view that this Court is not inclined to

mandate cohabitation and the resumption of a marital life upon any man or woman,

as the law currently stands, that appears before this Court.

Decision

Finally, I turn to address the question of law to which leave has been granted by the

Supreme Court on 16th July 2021, as previously cited.

In response to the question of law, pursuant to the aforementioned facts and

circumstances, I answer in the negative in finding that the learned Judges of the Civil

Appellate High Court did not misdirect themselves that the evidence led by the

Respondent amounts to malicious desertion. The appeal is thereby dismissed.

Appeal Dismissed.
