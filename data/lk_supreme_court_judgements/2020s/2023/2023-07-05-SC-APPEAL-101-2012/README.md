Facts of the case

This is an appeal to set aside the judgment of the Provincial High Court holden in Chilaw

[hereinafter referred to as the High Court], dismissing an appeal preferred against an Order that

forfeited a lorry transporting gravel without a valid licence by the Magistrates Court.

The claimant-appellant-appellant [hereinafter referred to as the appellant] is the registered owner

of the lorry bearing registration number SG GM-1178, which was forfeited to the State by the

learned Magistrate.

The driver of the said lorry was arrested by the Police while transporting gravel without a valid

licence and proceedings were instituted against the driver in the Magistrates Court of Marawila

in terms of section 136(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Act No. 15 of 1979, as amended

[hereinafter referred to as the Code of Criminal Procedure]. Further, the said lorry, along with the

gravel, was produced in the Magistrates Court by the Police.

Subsequently, the learned Magistrate had framed a charge against the said driver under section

182(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for transporting two cubes of gravel in a vehicle bearing

registration number SG GM-1178 without a valid licence issued in that behalf by the Competent

Authority, and that the said driver committed an offence by violating section 28(1) of the Mines

and Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992, punishable under section 63(1) of the said Act.

The driver of the lorry had pleaded guilty to the said charge. Accordingly, he was convicted and

imposed a fine of Rs. 60,000/-, which was paid by him on the same day. Further, the two cubes of

gravel that were being transported were forfeited by the learned Magistrate and ordered to be

released to the State Engineering Corporation.

On an application made by the appellant, who is the owner of the lorry, the said lorry was released

to the appellant on a bond of Rs. 1,500,000/-, pending the inquiry in terms of section 63A(2) of

the Mines and Minerals Act as amended by Act No. 66 of 2009. At the said inquiry, only the

appellant had given evidence.

After the conclusion of the said inquiry, the learned Magistrate delivered the Order holding that

the appellant had failed to take the necessary precautions to prevent the driver of the said lorry

5

from illegally transporting gravel without a valid licence, and therefore, the said lorry was forfeited

in terms of section 63(1) of the Mines and Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992.

Being aggrieved by the Order of the learned Magistrate forfeiting the said lorry, the appellant had

preferred an appeal to the High Court to set aside the said Order.

After the hearing of the said appeal, the High Court held that the appellant had no right to appeal

against the Order of the Magistrates Court to forfeit the lorry used for the offence in terms of the

Mines and Minerals Act, and affirmed the Order of the learned Magistrate dated 22nd of December,

2010.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant had moved the High Court to grant leave to

appeal to the Supreme Court in terms of section 9(a) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, and leave to appeal was granted on the following questions of

law:

i. Was the charge framed in this case legal and valid when it did not contain the mandatory

requirement prescribed by section 164(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure No. 15 of 1979

to mention in it the law and the section of the law under which the said confiscation/forfeiture,

being a punishment, could be made?

ii. Did this Provincial High Court err in law in dismissing Appeal No. HCA 11/2011 filed against

the confiscation/forfeiture of lorry No. SGGM 1178 based upon the conviction of the accused-

respondent-respondent of such an illegal and invalid charge?

iii. Did this Provincial High Court err in law when it upheld the confiscation/forfeiture of the said

lorry based on a conviction of a charge punishable under section 63(1) of the Mines and

Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992 neither which nor any amending act thereof had provided for the

confiscation/forfeiture of a vehicle?

iv. Did the Provincial High Court err in law when it refused Appeal No. HCA 11/2011 filed by

the petitioner based on a preliminary objection raised by the learned State Counsel of the said

High Court which was not tenable in law?

When the instant appeal was taken up for hearing, the parties to the appeal submitted that, even

though the learned High Court Judge dismissed the appeal on the premise that the appellant had

6

no right to appeal against an Order made under section 63B(1) of the Mines and Minerals Act No.

34 of 1992, as amended by Act No. 66 of 2009 [hereinafter referred to as the Mines and Minerals

Act] section 63B(3) of the said Act provides for an appeal against an order made for forfeiture.

Hence, both counsel appearing for the appellant and the respondent submitted that they will

confine themselves only to the third question of law set out above.

Submissions of the appellant

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that section 63B(1) of the Mines and Minerals

Act, as amended, confers power on the Magistrate to forfeit any mineral, machinery, equipment or

material used in or in connection with the commission of an offence under the said Act.

However, the aforesaid section does not specifically refer to vehicles and therefore, the said section

does not confer power on the Magistrates Court to forfeit vehicles. Further, similar Acts such as

section 40(1) of the Forest Conservation Ordinance, section 3A of the Animals Act, and section

79 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act expressly provide for the vehicle used in

the commission of an offence to be forfeited to the State.

Furthermore, the learned counsel contended that if the words in an Act are clear, the court does

not need to interpret the words and cited the Court of Appeal judgment delivered by Justice Salam

in Nishantha and 3 others v State [2014] 1 SLR 105 in support of said contention.

Moreover, the learned counsel cited the case of P.S. Priyantha Rajapakshe v Hon. Attorney

General (CA/PHC No. 72/2012) CA Minutes 27th of October, 2012, where the Court of Appeal

had released the vehicle to the registered owner following the aforementioned judgment

(Nishantha and 3 others v State [2014] 1 SLR 105).

In the circumstances, the learned counsel for the appellants stated that the Order of the learned

Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge erred in law and therefore, the said judgments should

be set aside.

7

Submissions of the respondent

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent submitted that the purpose of the Mines

and Minerals Act is to regulate, inter alia, the transportation of minerals. In this regard, the learned

Deputy Solicitor General drew the attention of the court to the long title of the Mines and Minerals

Act and submitted that if the intention of the legislature was to regulate the transportation of

minerals, it is necessary for the forfeiture of the vehicle being used to illegally transport the gravel

to achieve the intention of the said Act.

Further, it was contended that if the submissions of the appellant that the language of section

63B(1) of the Mines and Minerals Act as amended, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical

construction is accepted, that would lead to absurdity. Thus, the said section cannot be interpreted

to mean that only mineral, machinery, equipment or material used in or in connection with the

commission of the offence or the proceeds of the sale of any such mineral or material deposited in

court under the proviso to section 63A can be forfeited to the State, as the offence of transportation

of gravel cannot be committed without the use of a vehicle. Therefore, the said Act requires the

forfeiture of vehicles involved in the commission of an offence under section 63(1) of the Act.

Hence, it is necessary to adhere to the ordinary meaning of the words used in the statute and to the

grammatical construction, unless that is at variance with the intention of the legislature. However,

if the language of the statute leads to any manifest absurdity, the language may be varied or

modified so as to avoid such absurdity.

I shall now consider the following question of law where leave to appeal was granted by the High

Court.

Did the Provincial High Court err in law when it upheld the forfeiture of the lorry under

consideration based on a conviction of a charge punishable under section 63(1) of the Mines

and Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992?

The issue that needs to be considered in the instant appeal is whether the lorry used to transport

gravel could be forfeited to the State after an inquiry held under section 63B(1) of the Mines and

Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992, as amended by Act No. 66 of 2009.

8

In order to consider the above, the provisions of the Mines and Minerals Act and the purpose of

enacting the Act would be considered first. Thereafter, the effects of the Mines and Minerals Act

(Amendment) No. 66 of 2009 will be considered.

Mines and Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992

The long title of the said Act states as follows;

An Act to provide for the establishment of the geological survey and mines bureau

to regulate the exploration for, mining, transportation, processing, trading in or

export of, minerals for the transfer to such bureau of the functions of the department

of geological survey for the repeal of the salt ordinance (chapter 211) the

radioactive minerals act, No. 46 of 1968, and the mines and minerals law, No. 4 of

1973; and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

[emphasis added]

Upon a careful consideration of the long title of the Mines and Minerals Act, it is evident that the

Mines and Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992 repealed the Salt Ordinance (chapter 211), Radioactive

Minerals Act, No. 46 of 1968, and the Mines and Minerals Law, No. 4 of 1973 and established the

Geological Survey and Mines Bureau to regulate the exploration for, mining, transportation,

processing, trading in or export of, minerals and to provide for matters connected therewith or

incidental thereto with the view to having a more efficient and effective framework to regulate the

exploration of mining in the country.

Thus, repealing the previous legislation and enacting the new Act, which consolidated the

important provisions contained in the repealed legislation and introducing new provisions, shows

the intention of Parliament and the importance placed by the legislature in revising the laws at that

time.

However, the Principal Act did not provide sufficient stringent provisions to regulate the

exploration for mining, transportation, processing, trading in or export of minerals. Particularly,

there were no provisions to detect and forfeit to the State the machinery, equipment, material or

vehicles used in or in connection with the commission of an offence under the Mines and Minerals

Act. Moreover, the punishments stipulated in the Principal Act were not sufficient deterrents to

prevent violations under the said Act from occurring again.

9

Mines and Minerals (Amendment) Act No. 66 of 2009

Therefore, as the State could not achieve the intention of the Parliament in enacting the Principal

Act due to lack of sufficient provisions in it, the legislature amended sections 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13,

20A, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 37, 42, 46, 46A, 47, 48, 49, 51, 55, 57, 58, 61, 63, 64, 68, and 70

of the Principal Act by enacting the Mines and Minerals (Amendment) Act No. 66 of 2009.

Thus, a careful consideration of the said amendments to the Principal Act fortifies the said

observation made with regard to the intention of the legislature in enacting the Principal Act. Thus,

the intention of the Parliament in enacting and amending the Principal Act is a necessary factor

that should be taken into consideration in interpreting the provisions of the said Act.

In this regard, N S Bindras Interpretation of Statutes, Tenth Edition at page 492 to 493 states;

Turner LJ observed in the case of Hawkins v Gathercole (1855) 6 DM & G1,

Regard must be had to the intent and meaning of the legislature. The rule upon

this subject is well expressed in the case of Stradling v Morgan 75 ER 308.

Further, Lord Blackburn cited the said judgment with approval in Charles Bradlaugh v Henry

Lewis Clark Appeal [1893] 8 AC 354 at 373, which held as follows:

. where a statute was passed for the purpose of repealing and in part re-enacting

former statutes in pari materia are to be considered in order to see what it was that

the legislature intended to enact in lieu of the repealed enactments. It may appear

from the language used that the legislature intended to enact something quite

different from the previous law, and where that is the case effect must be given to

the intention.

Ownership and Discovery of Minerals

Section 26 of the Mines and Minerals Act, as amended, states that the ownership of minerals is

vested with the State notwithstanding any right of ownership that any person may have to the soil

where the minerals are found or situated.

10

Mining to be under the authority of a licence

Section 28(1) of the said Act states:

No person shall explore for, mine, transport, process, store, trade in or export

any mineral except under the authority of, or otherwise than in accordance with, a

licence issued in that behalf under the provisions of this Act and the regulations

made thereunder:

Provided [emphasis added]

Thus, section 28(1) of the said Act imposes restrictions, inter alia, on the transportation of minerals

without a valid license.

Offences

Section 63(1) of the said Act states:

(1) Any person who-

(a) Explores for, or mines, processes, stores, transports, trades in or exports,

any mineral without a licence in that behalf issued under this Act;

(b) .

(c) .

(d) being the holder of a licence issued under this Act, fails to notify the Bureau

of the discovery of any mineral discovered by him in the carrying out of the

activities authorized by the licence, shall be guilty of an offence under this

Act and shall on conviction after summary trial before a Magistrate be

liable to a fine not exceeding five hundred thousand rupees and in the case

of a second or subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding one million rupees

or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or to both such fine

and imprisonment. [emphasis added]

Thus, in terms of section 63(1)(a) of the Mines and Minerals Act as amended, any person who

explores or mines minerals, processes, stores, transports, trades in or exports any minerals without

a valid license in that behalf issued under the Act commits an offence under the Act. It is important

11

to note that exploration or mining, storing, transporting, trading or exporting of any minerals are

separate and distinct offences under the said section.

Further, as stated above, the Principal Act was amended by inserting sections 63A and 63B along

with several other sections to achieve the object of the Principal Act by conferring power on Police

Officers to seize and then forfeit to the State, any machinery, equipment or materials used in or in

connection with the commission of an offence when an offence has been committed under this

Act.

Power to seize any mineral, machinery, equipment or material

Section 63A of the Mines and Minerals Act states as follows:

(1) A police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has

been committed under this Act may, with or without a warrant, seize any

mined mineral quantity of mineral which has been mined, or any machinery,

equipment or material used in or in connection with, the commission of that

offence.

(2) Where any mineral, machinery, equipment or material is seized by a police

officer in pursuance of the powers conferred on him by this section, he shall

forthwith produce such mineral, machinery, equipment or material before, or

make it available for inspection by, a Magistrate, who shall make such order

as he thinks fit relating to the detention or custody of such mineral, machinery,

equipment or material, pending the conclusion of a prosecution instituted in

respect of such mineral, machinery, equipment or material.

Provided however, that where any minerals, machinery, equipment or material

so seized is subject to speedy decay, the Magistrate may order that such

minerals, machinery, equipment or material be sold and the proceeds of such

sale be deposited in Court. [emphasis added]

Thus, section 63A confers power on Police Officers to seize any machinery, equipment, or

materials used in or in connection with the commission of an offence under the said Act and

produce them in the Magistrates Court.

12

Power to forfeit to the State

Section 63B of the said Act reads as follows:

(1) Where any person is convicted of an offence under this Act, the Magistrate

may make order that any mineral, machinery, equipment or material used in,

or in connection with, the commission of that offence or the proceeds of the

sale of any such minerals, or material deposited in court under the proviso to

section 63A, be forfeited to the State.

(2) Any mineral, machinery, equipment or material forfeited by an order under

subsection (1), shall vest absolutely in the State upon the making of such

order.

(3)

(4) The Court shall cause any mineral, machinery, equipment or material which

has been vested in the State under subsection (2) to be sold and the proceeds

of such sale to be deposited in Court. [emphasis added]

Thus, section 63B(1) of the Act confers power on the learned Magistrate to forfeit to the State any

minerals, machinery, equipment or material produced in court under section 63A of the said Act

where any person is convicted of an offence under the Act.

However, the Mines and Minerals Act does not provide for an interpretation of the words

minerals, machinery, equipment, or material referred to in the Act.

Does the Magistrates Court have jurisdiction to forfeit to the State a vehicle under section

63B(1) of the Act?

Thus, it is necessary to consider whether a vehicle (lorry, tractor, tipper, boat, ship, etc.) that is

used to transport minerals contravening the provisions of the Act could be forfeited to the State by

a Magistrate after a conviction for committing an offence under the Act, when section 63B(1) of

the Mines and Minerals Act has not specifically referred to the forfeiture of vehicles.

A cursory glance at sections 63A and 63B shows that a vehicle is not specifically included in the

said sections. Thus, it is necessary to consider whether the words any, machinery and/or

13

equipment used or in connection with the commission of an offence in the said section

comes within the scope of sections 63A and 63B, notwithstanding the fact that a vehicle is not

specifically referred to in the said sections.

In interpreting a provision of law, it is necessary not only to look at the words of the section on the

face of the provision but also to consider the real meaning of it. Further, the legal meaning shall

prevail over a mere literal meaning on the face of a word or a phrase in an Act. Particularly, the real

meaning of a word should be considered when the meaning on the face of a word does not lead to

achieving the object of the Act or leads to absurdity over the real intended meaning by enacting the

legislation.

Further, if the plain meaning of the words used in an Act would lead to absurdity or be contrary to

the very purpose for which the legislation has been enacted, the intention of the legislature should

be ascertained and taken into consideration not only in considering a particular section but also the

entire Act and its amendments.

Furthermore, an interpretation of an Act shall not curtail the effect of the intended purpose of the

Act or restrict the results that it would otherwise achieve. Hence, it is necessary to adopt a

construction that would not result in futility, lead to difficulties in implementing an Act or cause

hardships to the public at large.

In the circumstances, a question will arise as to whether a machinery or equipment can be

used to transport the minerals. In this regard, it is necessary to give a purposive interpretation to

the words machinery or equipment in order to achieve a logical and rational meaning.

Moreover, giving an interpretation confined to these words will make the said part of the section

futile.

Hence, taking into consideration the rapid development in the technology of the equipment and

machinery used in the mining industry, the aforementioned words should be given an interpretation

that would be applicable to include the modern equipment and machinery used at present.

Therefore, the dictionary meaning of the word equipment will be considered to ascertain the real

meaning and the intended purpose of using the word equipment referred in the said Act.

14

Dictionary meaning

equipment

Blacks Law Dictionary (2nd edition) defines the word equipment as:

Tools, be they devices, machines/vehicles. Assist a person in achieving an action

beyond the normal capabilities of a human. Tangible property that is not

land/buildings, but facilitates business operation. [emphasis added]

Further, Strouds Judicial Dictionary (6th edition) defines the word equipment as:

Equipment for the purposes of s.1(1)(a) of the Employers Liability (Defective

Equipment) Act 1969 (c.37) was held to be wide enough to include a ship of

whatever size, notwithstanding that ships are not specifically mentioned in the

definition of equipment in subsection (3), whereas vehicles and aircrafts are

(Coltman v Bibbly Tankers [1987] 3 (3) W.L.R. 1181). [emphasis added]

Furthermore, in Coltman v Bibbly Tankers (supra), it was held that the term ship should be

included in the term equipment to achieve the intention of Parliament by making

employers liable for the injury or death of employees.

Longman Dictionary defines equipment as:

the tools, machines etc. that you need to do a particular job or activity.

[emphasis added]

Thus, the dictionary meaning of the word equipment shows that the word equipment includes

a vehicle used in or in connection with the commission of that offence under Mines and Minerals

Act No. 33 of 1992.

Applicability of Article 27(14) of the Constitution

Article 27(14) of the Constitution states:

The State shall respect, preserve and improve the environment for the benefit of

the community.

15

Hence, Article 27(14) requires the court to interpret the provisions of Mines and Minerals Act No.

33 of 1992, as amended, to harmonise with the said Article, as the Constitution is the Supreme

Law of the country. Further, no Act should be interpreted contrary to the provisions of the

Constitution. Thus, as mining has a direct impact on the environment, the provisions of the Mines

and Minerals Act No. 33 of 1992 should be interpreted in harmony with Article 27(14) of the

Constitution. Further, in this instance, such an interpretation is necessary in order to preserve and

improve the environment for the benefit of the community.

A similar view was observed in the case of Bulankulama and others v Secretary, Ministry of

Industrial Development and others [2000] 3 SLR 243, where it was held:

Article 27(14) states that The State shall protect, preserve and improve the

environment for the benefit of the community. Article 28(f) states that the exercise

and enjoyment of rights and freedoms (such as the 5th and 7th respondents claimed

in learned counsels submissions on their behalf to protection under Article 12 of

the Constitution relating to equal protection of the law) is inseparable from the

performance of duties and obligations, and accordingly it is the duty of every

person in Sri Lanka to protect nature and conserve its riches.

Consideration of the word any in section 63B

Section 63B of the Mines and Minerals Act also provides for any mineral, machinery, equipment

or material used in or in connection with the commission of that offence to be forfeited to the State

by the Magistrate. Taking into consideration the intention of the legislature and the scheme of the

Act, the said amendment to the Principal Act shows that the legislature has used the word any,

as it is not practical to specify all the minerals, machinery, equipment or materials that may be

used for exploration of minerals. Thus, the word any referred to in the said section shows that

the said word has been intentionally used to include any mineral, machinery, equipment or

material that has been used in connection with an offence committed under the said Act.

Applicability of section 28

Further, section 63B(1) should be considered along with the other provisions of the said Act.

Particularly, section 28(1) of the Act which prohibits inter alia the transportation of minerals

16

without a licence. Accordingly, any person transporting minerals without a valid licence commits

an offence under the Act. Thus, such a person is liable to be convicted under section 63(1) of the

said Act.

Furthermore, as stated above, section 63B(1) has conferred power on the learned Magistrate to

forfeit to the State any mineral, machinery, equipment or material used in or in connection with

the commission of an offence under the Act. Moreover, as the transportation of minerals without

a valid licence issued under the Act is an offence under the said Act, the equipment used to

transport minerals falls within the scope of section 63B(1). In this regard, it is pertinent to note

that any machinery, equipment or material used not only directly for exploration of mining but

also anything that would facilitate mining and transportation are subject to the scope of the said

section.

Thus, having considered the aforesaid dictionary meaning and the context where the word

equipment is used in the Mines and Minerals Act, I am of the opinion that the word equipment

used in the Act should be taken to include a vehicle (lorry, tipper or even a bullock cart) used to

transport minerals without a valid license issued under the said Act.

Therefore, I am of the view that the High Court did not err in law when it upheld the forfeiture of

the said lorry, which was transporting gravel contrary to the provisions of the said Act, based on a

conviction of a charge punishable under section 63B(1) of the Mines and Minerals Act as amended.

Further, the judgment delivered in Nishantha and 3 others v State (supra) has not considered

section 63B(1) of the said Act, as amended in the above context. Furthermore, in the said judgment,

the aforementioned amendments to the Principal Act were not considered in the context of sections

26, 28(1), 63(1), 63A and 63B of the Act and in the light of the object of enacting the Principal

Act. As a result, the said interpretation defeats the object of the said amendments made to the

Principal Act. Moreover, I am of the opinion that the interpretation given to the word equipment

in the said judgment is repugnant to Article 27(14) of the Constitution. Thus, I am of the view that

the said judgment is per in curium though it was cited by the appellants.

In light of the above, the following question of law should be answered as follows:

Did this Provincial High Court err in law when it upheld the confiscation/forfeiture of the said

lorry based on a conviction of a charge punishable under section 63(1) of the Mines and Minerals

17

Act No. 33 of 1992 neither which nor any amending act thereof had provided for the

confiscation/forfeiture of a vehicle?

No

The appeal is dismissed. I order no costs.
