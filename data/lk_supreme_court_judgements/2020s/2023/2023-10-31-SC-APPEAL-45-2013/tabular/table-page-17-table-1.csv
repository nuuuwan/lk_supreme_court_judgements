"32. The Plaintiff relied on Candappa v. Ponnambalampillai (1993) 1 SLR 184 to state"
"that a party cannot be permitted to present in appeal a case different from that"
"presented  to  the  lower  court.  In Candappa (supra)  it  was  held  that  “A party"
"cannot be permitted to present in appeal a case different from that presented in"
"t
he trial court where matters of fact are involved which were not in issue at the"
"t
r
i
a
l
 
such case not being one which raises a pure question of law.”"
"33. In the matter before us, I do not think the issue of reversing the judgement of the"
"High Court of Civil Appeals (dated 11th March 2010) would arise, and as such"
"there is no necessity to consider the arguments placed before this court on behalf"
"of the Plaintiff, regarding the said issue."
"34. For the reasons set out above, I hold that with the death of the original Defendant,"
"the proceedings became abated and what proceeded thereafter has no legal effect."
"I hold further that a judgment entered against a dead party after the judgment is"
"reserved but prior to the delivery of the same is abated and as such the judgement"
"of the High Court of Civil Appeal dated 11th March 2011 has no effect in law."
"Accordingly, I answer the questions of law referred to in subparagraphs (i) and"
"(ii)  of  paragraph  19  of 
the  Petition  referred 
to  above 
in 
the  affirmative."
"Accordingly, the appeal is allowed."
"35. Upon perusal of the proceedings before the High Court of Civil Appeals, it is clear"
"that  the  written  submissions  in  connection  with  the  appeal  challenging  the"
"District Court judgement in DC L/752 had been filed on 28th October 2008 and"
"the matter had been taken up for argument on 23rd July 2009. The arguments"
"had been concluded on the same day and judgement was reserved. Not only the"
"original  Defendant  had  been  alive  but  was  also  represented  before  the  court."
"Thus,  there  is  no  question  about  his  interest  in  the  appeal  being  adequately"
"safeguarded."
"36. In the circumstances I make the following orders;"
