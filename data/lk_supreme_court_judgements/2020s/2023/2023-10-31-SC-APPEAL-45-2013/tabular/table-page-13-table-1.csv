"22. Explaining the steps to take after the abatement of appeal, Her Ladyship referred"
"to the Indian judgments Kanailal Manna and Others v. Bhabataran Santra and"
"O
t
hers (AIR 1970 Calcutta 99) and Achhar Singh and Others v. Smt. Ananti (AIR"
"1971 Punjab & Haryana 477). In both these judgments it was held that where an"
"appeal becomes a nullity due to being passed in ignorance of the death of one of"
"the defendants during the pendency of that appeal (as in the present case, subject"
"to the distinction that in the present case the Defendant had passed away only"
"after the judgment was reserved) and when that appeal had abated totally, the"
"proper course is to set aside the decree and to remand the case to the court where"
"the abatement took place. It was further stated in both cases that if there is an"
"entitlement, it could be kept open for the parties concerned to take steps to get the"
"abatement set aside. On the strength of these judgments, the case was sent back"
"to the District Court for the appellant to take steps for substitution."
