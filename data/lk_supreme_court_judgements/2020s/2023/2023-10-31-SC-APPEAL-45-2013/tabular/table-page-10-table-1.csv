"14. Upon considering the questions of law referred to in the preceding paragraph, it"
"appears  that  the  issues  raised  in  the  said  questions  of  law  are  intrinsically"
"interwoven and the crux of the matter is contained in the questions no. (i) and"
"(iii) of paragraph 19. That is, whether a judgment entered against a dead party is"
"void and a nullity and if so, whether the judgement of the High Court of Civil"
"Appeal has no effect in law and is a nullity."
"15. The death of the original Defendant prior to the delivery of the judgment of the"
"Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal means that there was no (live) defendant"
"before  the  court.  As  such  the  judgment  of  the  Provincial  High  Court  of  Civil"
"Appeal is a nullity and is coram non judice. In Ittepana v. Hemawathie 1981 1"
"SLR 319 at page 483, Justice Sharvananda recognized the ‘jurisdiction of persons’"
"as one of the three heads of jurisdiction necessary for a judgment to be valid. His"
"Lordship, as he then was, cited Black on Judgments at page 261 to explain the"
"‘jurisdiction  of  persons’;  “It [the court] cannot act upon persons who are not"
"l
egally before it, upon one who is not a party to the suit… upon a defendant who"
"has never been notified of the proceedings.” His Lordship further cited Black to"
"illuminate the effect that the lack of jurisdiction would have on a judgment. “If"
"t
he court has no jurisdiction, it is of no consequence that the proceedings had"
"been formally conducted, for they are coram non judice. A judgment entered by"
"such court is void and a mere nullity.”"
"16. In the present case,  at the stage of the first appeal, the original Defendant had"
"passed away after the conclusion of the proceedings, but before the delivery of"
"the judgment. As such the Defendant, being alive upto the point of the judgment"
"being  reserved,  has  been  present  and  represented  before 
the  High  Court."
"Although there was no live defendant before the court at the time of the delivery"
"of the judgment, the Defendant having been present and represented before the"
"High Court in the abovementioned manner, the judgment, rather than becoming"
"an outright nullity, became abated.  Subsequently, it becomes necessary to effect"
