"Hameed v. Weerasinghe [1989] 1 S.L.R. 217 it was held that,"
"in a vindicatory action, it is necessary to aver and prove title, but"
"where title is not disputed, a plaintiff may sue for  ejectment. It"
"was submitted that, in the instant case, in a circumstance where"
"the appellantâ€™s title has been admitted by the respondents, there"
"is no requirement for the appellant to prove title and that he is"
"entitled to an order ejecting the respondents."
"17. It was further submitted that, in accordance with the provisions"
"of the  Evidence Ordinance, facts that are admitted need not be"
"proved. As the admission in the instant case relates to a question"
"of fact and not law, the tile which is admitted need not be proved."
"18. It was submitted that the learned Judges of the High Court have"
"failed  to  consider  that,  in  an  action  for  declaration  of  title  and"
"ejectment, the plaintiff (appellant) sues on the right of possession"
"and ouster and need not prove title."
