"In Punchihamy v. Arnolis(6) it  was held  that  a purchaser  who"
"had  not  been  placed  in  possession  may  bring  a  vindicatory"
"action. Even a person who had a mere ""nuda proprietas"" (bare"
"legal 
title)  was  recognized  as  a  person  entitled 
to 
file  a"
"vindicatory action. Allis Appu v. Endiris Hamy (supra)."
"But in an action for declaration of title and ejectment the proof"
"that a Plaintiff had enjoyed an earlier peaceful possession of"
"the 
land  and 
that  subsequently  he  was  ousted  by 
the"
"Defendant would give rise to a rebuttable presumption of title"
"in  favour  of  the  Plaintiff  and  thus  could  be  classified  as  an"
"action  where  dominium  need  not  be  proved  strictly.  It  would"
"appear therefore that law permits a person who has possessed"
"peacefully  but  cannot  establish  clear  title  or  ownership  to  be"
"restored  to  possession  and  be  quieted  in  possession.  This"
"development of the law appears to have arisen due to the need"
"to protect de facto possession. It is different from the right of an"
"owner recovering his possession through a vindicatory action."
"Our  courts  have  always  emphasized  that  the  plaintiff  who"
"institutes 
a 
vindicatory 
action 
must 
prove 
title."
"(Vide Wanigaratne v. Juwanis Appuhamy.(7))"
"Withers,  J.,  in Allis  Appu  v.  Endiris  Hamy  (supra) when  he"
"referred to jus terttii as a defence to a rei vindicatio action, he"
"no  doubt  took  into  consideration  the  fact  that  ownership  or"
"dominium is the essence of a vindicatory action and title being"
"in the hands of a third party could be relevant in such cases."
"But in an action for declaration of title and ejectment as in the"
"present  case,  the  Plaintiff  need  not  sue  by  right  of"
"ownership  but  could  do  so  by  right  of  possession  and"
"ouster. 
In 
fact 
in  such  cases 
the  Plaintiff 
is  claiming  a"
"possessory  remedy  rather  than  the  relief  of  vindication  of"
"ownership.‚Äù"
