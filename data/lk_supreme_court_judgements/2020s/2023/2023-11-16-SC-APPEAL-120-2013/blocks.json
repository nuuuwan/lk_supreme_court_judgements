It would appear therefore that law permits a person who has possessed peacefully but cannot establish clear title or ownership to be restored to possession and be quieted in possession. This development of the law appears to have arisen due to the need to protect de facto possession. It is different from the right of an owner recovering his possession through a vindicatory action.

The licensee (the defendant-respondent) obtaining possession is deemed to obtain it upon the terms that he will not dispute the title of him, i.e. the plaintiff-appellant without whose permission, he (the defendant-respondent) would not have got it. The effect of the operation of section 116 of the Evidence Ordinance is that if a licensee desires to challenge the title under which he is in occupation he must, first, quit the land. The fact that the licensee or the lessee obtained possession from the plaintiff-appellant is perforce an admission of the fact that the title resides in the plaintiff. No question of title can possibly arise on the pleadings in this case, because, as the defendant-respondent has stated in his answer that he is a lessee under the plaintiff-appellant, he is estopped from denying the title of the plaintiff-appellant. It is an inflexible rule of law that no lessee or licensee will ever be permitted either to question the title of the person who gave him the lease or the licence or the permission to occupy or possess the land or to set up want of title in that person, i.e. of the person who gave the licence or the lease.
