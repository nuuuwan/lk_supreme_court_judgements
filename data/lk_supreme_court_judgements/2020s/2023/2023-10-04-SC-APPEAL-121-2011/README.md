ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 04th October 2023

P. PADMAN SURASENA J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 3rd Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellant as well as the submissions of the learned Counsel for the

Defendants-Appellants-Respondents and concluded the argument.

The Plaintiffs filed their plaint initially against the 1st and 2nd Defendants praying

inter alia:

(i) for a declaration that the 1st-3rd Plaintiffs are the owners of

the lands more fully set out in the schedules to the plaint;

(ii) for an order cancelling the Deed No. 3607 attested on

11-06-2001 by D.M.M. Dissanayake, Notary Public transferring

the land described in schedule 1 to the 1st Defendant.

(iii) for an order cancelling the Deed No. 2147 attested on 15-07-

2003 by P.A.C. Wijesinghe, Notary Public transferring the land in

the 2nd schedule to the 2nd Defendant.

[SC Appeal No. 121/2011] - Page 5 of 12

5

(iv) for ejectment of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants from the relevant

lands.

1st and 2nd Defendants filed a joint answer admitting that the 1st and 2nd

Defendants had no title to the paddy land relevant to this case. The 1st and 2nd

Defendants also averred that Mahara Mohottalalage Herath Banda was the tenant

cultivator of the paddy land relevant to the instant action. The material prayer in

the joint answer filed by the 1st and 2nd Defendants is only a prayer to add said

Mahara Mohottalalage Herath Banda as a Defendant to the case. This is because

the 1st and 2nd Defendants in their joint answer itself had categorically averred the

fact that neither of them has any title to the paddy land relevant to the action but

their role is limited only to assisting said Mahara Mohottalalage Herath Banda who

is the tenant cultivator of the said paddy land. It was on that basis that the learned

District Judge had taken steps to add said Mahara Mohottalalage Herath Banda as

the 3rd Defendant of the case.

After adding said Mahara Mohottalalage Herath Banda as the 3rd Defendant, he

(the 3rd Defendant) also had filed an answer admitting that Menuhamy had been

the tenant cultivator under Amarasinghe Arachchige Don Albanu Appuhamy. He

also has stated in his answer that after the demise of said Menuhamy, he

continued as the tenant cultivator. There is no dispute that Menuhamy is the

father of the 3rd Defendant (Herath Banda).

The above facts show that the 1st and 2nd Defendants had not claimed anything in

their favour as far as either the possession or the ownership of the properties

relevant to this case are concerned.

The 3rd Defendant had taken up two main issues. Firstly, he has not admitted that

Piyasiri Amarasinghe is the son of Isabela Hamine. Secondly, the 3rd Defendant has

also raised the issue that the title to this property has not devolved on said Piyasiri

Amarasinghe as he was not entitled to receive a letter of administration in respect

of this property after the demise of Isabela Hamine. In respect of the prayers for

cancellation of the two deeds, the 3rd Respondent has taken up the position that

the execution of those two deeds was a mistake on his part. We observe that there

exists only one material prayer in the 3rd Defendants answer. That is a prayer for a

declaration that the 3rd Defendant is the tenant cultivator in case the Court grants

the declaration that the Plaintiffs are the owners of the relevant land. As pointed

[SC Appeal No. 121/2011] - Page 6 of 12

6

out by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant, we observe that there are

two material admissions made in the trial. They are as follows:

(1) Menuhamy had functioned as a tenant cultivator under

Amarasinghe Arachchige Don Albanu Appuhamy.

(2) The 3rd Defendant had functioned as a tenant cultivator under 1st, 2nd

and 3rd Plaintiffs.

After the trial, the learned District Judge by his judgement dated 05-06-2007,

having analyzed the evidence produced in the case before the District Court, had

proceeded to grant reliefs prayed for, by the Plaintiffs in their plaint.

Being aggrieved by the judgement of the District Court, the Defendants had

appealed to the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. The Provincial High Court of

Civil Appeals for the reasons set out in the judgement dated 27-10-2010, has set

aside the judgement of the District Court. Perusal of the judgement of the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals shows that the sole ground for setting aside

the judgement of the District Court is the alleged failure of the Plaintiffs to prove

the fact that their father, Piyasiri Amarasinghe was a child of Dona Isabela Hamine.

The learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeals had taken the view that the

documents produced by the Plaintiffs marked P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10 and P11

are not sufficient to prove the fact that the Plaintiffs father Piyasiri Amarasinghe is

the only child of Isabela Hamine. It is in that background that this Court is now

called upon to decide the following two central issues that had arisen in the course

of the argument of this case in this Court.

i. Have the learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeals erred in holding

that the documents produced by the Plaintiffs do not establish that Piyasiri

Amarasinghe is the son of Dona Isabela Hamine;

ii. Has the High Court of Civil Appeals erred in not considering the legal effect of

the admission No. 3 wherein the 3rd Defendant had admitted that at

sometimes prior to filing of this case, he was a tenant cultivator under the

Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs mother.

Let me consider whether the Plaintiffs in the instant case, through the documents

produced by them, had established the fact that Piyasiri Amarasinghe is the son of

[SC Appeal No. 121/2011] - Page 7 of 12

7

Dona Isabela Hamine. The 01st Plaintiff in her evidence had produced her fathers

school leaving certificate marked P4. Although her fathers name has been written

in P4 as Peter Singho, the 01st Plaintiff in her evidence had clarified that her father

used his name as Piyasiri Amarasinghe. The 01st Plaintiff in her evidence had also

produced two obituary notices marked P5 and P6. According to these two obituary

notices (P5 and P6), the death of A. D.A. Appuhamy was announced by his son

Piyasiri Amarasinghe.

The 01st Plaintiff in her evidence had also produced her fathers and mothers

wedding invitation card marked P7. This wedding invitation card has identified

Piyasiri as the son of Don Albanu Amerasinghe Appuhamy and Dona Isabela Perera

Palihawadana Arachchi Hamine. The 01st Plaintiff in her evidence had testified to

the fact that said Piyasiri is her father. The 01st Plaintiff had also testified in her

evidence that the bride mentioned in the Wedding invitation card (P7) Rathnawali

is her mother.

The 01st Plaintiff had also produced the Marriage certificate of her father and

mother marked P8. According to P8, the 01st Plaintiffs father who stood as the

bride groom in that wedding has been named as Amerasinghe Arachchige Piyasiri

Amerasinghe. The bride grooms father's name has been mentioned in P8 as

Amerasinghe Arachchige Don Albanu Appuhamy whom the 01st Plaintiff has

asserted in her evidence as her paternal grandfather.

Another document produced by the 01st Plaintiff in her evidence is a permit issued

by Narammala Village Council which had permitted her father to bury the body of

her grandmother whose name has been mentioned therein as P A. D. Isabela

Perera. This burial permit has been produced marked P9.

The 01st Plaintiff had also produced two receipts issued by Wijesinghe Florists

which are invoices issued in relation to the expenses borne with regard to a

funeral. It is the 01st Plaintiffs evidence that these invoices marked P10 and P11

are receipts issued to her father Piyasiri Amerasinghe for the payment of funeral

expenses to Wijesinghe Florists in relation to the funeral of Palihawadana

Arachchige Dona Isabela Perera Hamine who is her grand mother.

Thus, the Plaintiffs had relied on the following documents namely: P7 the copy of

the wedding invitation of Piyasiri Amarasinghe where it is stated that he was the

only child of Don Albanu Amarasinghe Appuhamy and Dona Isabela Perera

[SC Appeal No. 121/2011] - Page 8 of 12

8

Palihawadana Arachchi Hamine; the marriage certificate of Piyasiri Amarasinghe

P8 which shows that he is the son of Amrasinghe Arachchige Don Albanu

Appuhamy; P9, P10 and P11 which are receipts for payments made by Piyasiri

Amarasinghe to the Narammala Village Committee and to the funeral undertakers

for the burial and other funeral arrangements of Isabela Hamine, to establish the

fact that Piyasiri Amarasinghe is the son of Dona Isabela Hamine. Perusal of the

questions asked on behalf of the Defendants during the cross examination of the

01st Plaintiff shows clearly that the Defendants had not been successful in assailing

the above evidence adduced by the 01st Plaintiff. The Defendants in the cross

examination had been content only to highlight the fact that the 01st Plaintiff had

not produced her fathers (Piyasiri Amarasinghes) birth certificate to prove that

said Piyasiri Amarasinghe is the son of said Isabela Hamine. Having considered the

above documentary as well as the oral evidence, we are satisfied that the Plaintiffs

have sufficiently proved that their father Piyasiri Amarasinghe is the son of Dona

Isabela Hamine.

The learned Judge of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals had taken the view

that the three receipts marked P9, P10 and P11 cannot be construed as evidence

relevant, under section 32(5) of the Evidence Ordinance, to the matter in issue. He

had proceeded to hold that the documents produced marked P3 to P12 cannot also

be held to be relevant under section 32(5) of the Evidence Ordinance.

Let me reproduce below, Section 32(5) of the Evidence Ordinance:

S. 32: Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person

who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of

giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an

amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case,

appears to the court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the

following cases :

1) ..

2) ..

3) ..

4) ..

5) When the statement relates to the existence of any

relationship by blood, marriage, or adoption between

persons as to whose relationship by blood, marriage, or

[SC Appeal No. 121/2011] - Page 9 of 12

9

adoption the person making the statement had special

means of knowledge, and when the statement was made

before the question in dispute was raised.

6) When the statement relates to the existence of any relationship

by blood, marriage, or adoption between persons deceased,

and is made in any will or deed relating to the affairs of the

family to which any such deceased person belonged, or in any

family pedigree, or upon any tombstone, family portrait, or

other thing on which such statements are usually made, and

when such statement was made before the question in dispute

was raised.

7)

8)

Section 50 of the Evidence Ordinance is also relevant in that regard and hence is

reproduced below:

S.50: When the court has to form an opinion as to the relationship of one

person to another, the opinion, expressed by conduct, as to the existence of

such relationship of any person who, as a member of the family or

otherwise, has special means of knowledge on the subject, is a relevant

fact:

Provided that such opinion shall not be sufficient to prove a marriage in

proceedings for divorce, or in prosecutions under sections 362B, 362C, and

362D of the Penal Code.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the 3rd Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant relied inter

alia on the judgment in the case of Maniapillai and others Vs. Sivasamy.1 In

Maniapillai's case, the issue arose was whether a person was born of a lawful

wedlock. In other words, the resolution of the dispute that arose in that case, was

dependent on the answer to the question whether Sinnapodi Velupillai married one

Annaletchumi and had a child Kailasapillai by her. In that case, there was neither

the birth certificate of Kailasapillai nor the marriage certificate of Sinnapodi

Velupillai and Annaletchumi had been produced. However, the deed No. 3873

(marked D3 in that case) of 20th May 1907 whereby Sinnapodi Velupillai and his

1 1980 (2) Sri L.R. 214.

[SC Appeal No. 121/2011] - Page 10 of 12

10

father Vyravi Sinnapodi had donated a land to Kailasapillai who was described as

the son of Velupillai and grandson of Sinnapodi had been produced as evidence in

that case. There was also the certificate of marriage (marked D4 in that case) of

Kailasapillai where his father's name had been given as Sinnapodi Velupillai. Soza,

J relying on the strength of the contents in those documents adduced as evidence

in that case, held that the declarations regarding the relationship found in the

documents marked D3 and D4 produced in that case, were relevant and admissible

to find an answer to the question whether Sinnapodi Velupillai had indeed married

one Annaletchumi and had a child Kailasapillai by her.

Soza J, in Maniapillai's case, in relation to sections 32(5) 32(6) and 50 of the

Evidence Ordinance, proceeded to state as follows:

Under the provisions of section 32(6) of the Evidence Ordinance when a

statement of the deceased person relates to the existence of any

relationship by blood, marriage or adoption between deceased persons it

will be admissible provided-

1. it is made in any will or deed relating to the affairs of the

family to which any such deceased person belonged, or in

any family pedigree, or upon any tombstone, family

portrait or other thing on which such statements are

usually made, and

2. it was made before the question in dispute was raised.

Section 50 of the Evidence Ordinance makes relevant the opinion

expressed by conduct, as to the existence of relationship of any person

who as a member of the family or otherwise has special means of

knowledge of such relationship.

It is under these provisions, to wit, section 32(5) and (6) and section 50 of

the Evidence Ordinance that it is possible to admit evidence, otherwise

hearsay, of deceased persons figuring in a genealogical tree such as one

often comes across in a partition case. - see Cooray v Wijesuriya.2 It should

be observed that these provisions deal not with presumptions but only with

relevance. There is no doubt that the declarations regarding relationship

found in D3 and D4 are relevant and admissible. But these declarations

2 (1958) 62 NLR 158.

[SC Appeal No. 121/2011] - Page 11 of 12

11

must be assessed and evaluated in the context of the other evidence in the

case.3

Thus, for the above reasons, I hold that the view taken by the learned Judge of the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals that the three receipts marked P9, P10 and

P11 cannot be construed as evidence relevant under section 32(5) of the Evidence

Ordinance to the matter in issue and the documents produced marked P3 to P12

cannot be held to be relevant under section 32(5) of the Evidence Ordinance is

erroneous. I have already adverted to the fact that the above documentary evidence

taken in to consideration along with the oral evidence adduced on behalf of the

Plaintiffs, have sufficiently proved that the father of the Plaintiffs Piyasiri

Amarasinghe is the son of Dona Isabela Hamine. Therefore, the learned Judge of

the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals has erred in arriving at the conclusion

that the Plaintiffs had failed to prove the fact that their father, Piyasiri Amarasinghe

was a child of Dona Isabela Hamine.

We observe that the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals had

required strict proof of the afore-said relationship. H.N.G. Fernando, J in the case of

Pathirana V. Jayasundara, 58 NLR 169, had the following to say in relation to the

requirement of strict proof in vindicatory actions -:

I have no doubt that it is open to a lessor in an action for ejectment to ask for

a declaration of title, but the question of difficulty which arises is whether the

action thereby becomes a rei vindicatio for which strict proof of the Plaintiffs

title would be required, or else is merely one for a declaration (without strict

proof) of a title which the tenant is by law precluded from denying. If the

essential element of a rei vindicatio is that the right of ownership must be

strictly proved, it is difficult to accept the proposition that an action in which

the Plaintiff can automatically obtain a declaration of title through the

operation of a rule of estoppel should be regarded as a vindicatory action

In the same case, Gratiaen, J. in his judgment while agreeing with H.N.G. Fernando,

J had further elaborated on this in the following manner:

A decree for a declaration of title may, of course, be obtained by way of

additional relief either in a rei vindicatio action proper (which is in truth an

action in rem) or in a lessors action against his overholding tenant (which is 3 At page 217.

[SC Appeal No. 121/2011] - Page 12 of 12

12

an action in personam). But in the former case, the declaration is based on

proof of ownership; in the latter, on proof of the contractual relationship which

forbids a denial that the lessor is the true owner

We observe that there is no specific mention in the judgement of the Provincial

High Court of Civil Appeals that the learned Judge of the Provincial High Court of

Civil Appeals had specifically treated this case as a rei vindicatio action when

deciding this case. However, from the fact that the learned Judge of the Provincial

High Court of Civil Appeals had required strict proof of the afore-said relationship,

could be an indication that the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals may have been confused on this aspect of the case.

Be that as it may, in view of the admission made by the 3rd Defendant that he

functioned as the tenant cultivator under the Plaintiffs, we see no necessity for the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals to require strict proof of the afore-said

relationship. In those circumstances, we hold that the learned Judge of the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals had erred in totally disregarding the presence

of the aforesaid admission made by the Defendants. Therefore, we decide to set

aside the judgment dated 27-10-2010 pronounced by the learned Judges of the

Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. We proceed to restore the judgment dated

05-06-2007 pronounced by the learned District Judge.

Appeal is allowed.
