"[SC Appeal No. 121/2011] - Page 6 of 12"
"out by the learned President’s Counsel for the Appellant, we observe that there are"
"two material admissions made in the trial. They are as follows:"
"(1)   
Menuhamy had functioned as a tenant cultivator under"
"Amarasinghe Arachchige Don Albanu Appuhamy."
"(
2) 
The 3rd Defendant had functioned as a tenant cultivator under 1st, 2nd"
"and 3rd Plaintiffs."
"After  the  trial,  the  learned  District  Judge  by  his  judgement  dated  05-06-2007,"
"having  analyzed  the  evidence  produced  in  the  case  before  the  District  Court,  had"
"proceeded to grant reliefs prayed for, by the Plaintiffs in their plaint."
"Being  aggrieved  by  the 
judgement  of  the  District  Court,  the  Defendants  had"
"appealed to the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals. The Provincial High Court of"
"Civil  Appeals  for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the  judgement  dated  27-10-2010,  has  set"
"aside 
the 
judgement  of 
the  District  Court.  Perusal  of 
the 
judgement  of 
the"
"Provincial High Court of Civil Appeals shows that the sole ground for setting aside"
"the  judgement  of  the  District  Court  is  the  alleged  failure  of  the  Plaintiffs  to  prove"
"the fact that their father, Piyasiri Amarasinghe was a child of Dona Isabela Hamine."
"The learned Judges of the High Court of Civil Appeals had taken the view that the"
"documents produced by the Plaintiffs marked P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P10 and P11"
"are not sufficient to prove the fact that the Plaintiffs’ father Piyasiri Amarasinghe is"
"the  only  child  of  Isabela  Hamine.  It  is  in  that  background  that  this  Court  is  now"
"called upon to decide the following two central issues that had arisen in the course"
"of the argument of this case in this Court."
"i. 
Have  the  learned  Judges  of  the  High  Court  of  Civil  Appeals  erred  in  holding"
"that the documents produced by the Plaintiffs do not establish that Piyasiri"
"Amarasinghe is the son of Dona Isabela Hamine;"
"ii. 
Has the High Court of Civil Appeals erred in not considering the legal effect of"
"the  admission  No.  3  wherein 
the  3rd  Defendant  had  admitted 
that  at"
"sometimes  prior  to  filing  of  this  case,  he  was  a  tenant  cultivator  under  the"
"Plaintiffs and Plaintiff’s mother."
"Let me consider whether the Plaintiffs in the instant case, through the documents"
"produced by them, had established the fact that Piyasiri Amarasinghe is the son of"
