"“Every  wrong  decision  or  breach  of  the  law  does  not  attract  the  constitutional"
"remedies relating  to  fundamental rights.  Where a transgression of the law takes"
"place, due solely to some corruption, negligence or error of judgement, I do not"
"think a person can be allowed to come under Article 126 and allege that there has"
"been a violation of constitutional guarantees. There may also be other instances"
"where mistakes or wrongful acts are done in the course of proceedings for which"
"ordinarily  there  are  built-in  safe-guards  or  adequate  procedures  for  obtaining"
"relief.”"
