Judgement

Aluwihare, PC, J

The 1st Accused-Appellant-Appellant in SC Appeal No. 129/2018 and the 2nd

Accused-Appellant-Appellant in SC Appeal No. 128/2018 (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Appellants) were indicted in the High Court of Kalutara on the

following Counts:

1. That on or about 26.03.2000 the two accused along with one Edirisinghe

Arachchige Gemunu Ranjith who is now deceased, committed the offence of

Robbery of Rs. 37,579/- from the Pelpola Co-Operative Rural Bank, an offence

punishable under Section 4 of the Offences Against Public Property Act, No. 12

of 1982 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code; and

2. In the course of the same transaction in the aforementioned count, the two

accused along with the said Edirisinghe Arachchige Gemunu Ranjith Possessed

a Firearm without a license, and thereby committed an offence punishable

under Section 22(1) read with Section 22(3) of the Firearms Ordinance as

amended by Act, No. 22 of 1996; and

3. In the course of the same transaction in the aforementioned count, the two

accused along with said Edirisinghe Arachchige Gemunu Ranjith Possessed a

Hand Grenade without lawful authority and thereby committed an offence

punishable under Section 2(1)(b) of the Offensive Weapons Act, No. 18 of

1996.

At the conclusion of the trial, the two Appellants were convicted of all counts referred

to above and accordingly were imposed the following sentences.

Count 1: 20 Years of rigorous imprisonment with a Fine of Rs. 112, 737/= with a

default term of 6 months.

Count 2: Imprisonment for life.

Count 3: 10 Years rigorous imprisonment with a Fine of Rs. 10,000 with a default

term of 3 months.

In consideration of the Appellants commendable services in the Army during a time

of war, and the fact that the 1st Accused-Appellant-Appellant is disabled, the learned

High Court Judge ordered that the terms of imprisonment imposed to run

concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the Judgement of the High Court, the two Appellants appealed to

the Court of Appeal against the same. In the Court of Appeal, the learned Counsel for

the Appellants submitted that they would confine their challenge in relation to the

conviction and the sentence imposed in respect of Count 2, [possession of the firearm]

and the Judgement of the Court of Appeal therefore addresses matters relating to

Count 2 alone. By its judgement dated 17.03.2017, the Court of Appeal affirmed the

judgement of the High Court. Being aggrieved by the said Judgement, the Appellants

sought special leave to appeal from this Court and special leave was granted on the

following question of Law in respect of both appeals.

Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that the Petitioner was guilty of the offence of

possessing a firearm under the provisions of the Firearms Ordinance without it being

established that what was possessed by the Petitioner was a firearm within the

meaning of the Firearms Ordinance?

This judgement shall apply to both appeals, that is SC Appeal No. 128/2018 as well

as SC Appeal No. 129/2018. Before addressing the question of law, I will briefly state

the factual narrative relating to the 2nd count in both appeals.

The version of the Prosecution, per the evidence adduced at the trial was that the

Police had recovered a Pistol from the trouser pocket of the 1st Appellant at the time

of his arrest. The Officer-in-Charge [Rex Jensen] gave evidence to the effect that after

taking the pistol into custody, it was handed over to the Police reserve but had then

been misplaced, and that an inquiry regarding the misplacement was pending. The

prosecution stated that the gun could not be located and as such it was not sent to the

Government Analyst for examination and report, and that therefore, the Government

Analysts report could not be produced at the trial. The non-production of the Pistol

and the Government Analysts Report forms the crux of this appeal.

Submission of the Appellants

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Accused-Appellant-Appellant in SC Appeal

No. 129/2018 contended that the convictions were bad in law as the said Pistol

(alleged by the Prosecution to have been possessed by the Appellants without license),

and the Government Analysts Report which would have affirmed possession were not

6

produced at the trial. Essentially, the Counsel argued that a prosecution for an offence

of possession of a firearm under the Firearms Ordinance could not succeed without

the production of the supposed Firearm, and the Government Analysts Report on the

said Firearm as it could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt that what was

possessed was actually a Firearm within the meaning of the Ordinance. Learned

Counsel for the 2nd Accused-Appellant-Appellant in SC Appeal No. 128/2018 took

up a similar position and associated himself with the submissions made by the learned

Presidents Counsel.

Section 2 of the Firearms Ordinance as amended defines an Automatic Gun as a gun

which repeatedly ejects an empty cartridge shell, and introduces new cartridge on the

firing of the gun. Since the pistol was not produced, the learned Counsel for the

Appellants argued that the prosecution had necessarily failed to prove that the item

which was possessed by the Appellants was in fact a Firearm, and an automatic gun

within the meaning of Section 2 of the Ordinance, and that it follows therefore that

the prosecution had failed to prove that the Appellants were in possession of a Firearm

without a license punishable under Section 22(1) read with Section 22(3) of the

Firearms Ordinance as amended by Act, No. 22 of 1996. The learned Presidents

Counsel also noted that the High Court relied on the proviso to Section 22 of the

Ordinance as amended and argued that as the count 2 on the indictment does not

allege possession of an automatic gun or a repeater shotgun but merely refers to a

gun, even if the prosecution had succeeded in establishing that the Appellants

possessed a firearm, the Appellants could not have been sentenced to Life

Imprisonment upon conviction of said count.

The proviso to Section 22(3) stipulates that Provided that where the offence consists

of having the custody or possession of, or of using, an automatic gun or repeater

shotgun, the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for life.

Submission of the Prosecution

The learned DSG contended that the facts of the case are of a distinct nature in that

the mere absence of the Pistol or the Government Analysts Report in evidence should

not defeat the conviction. At the High Court, and the Court of Appeal, the learned DSG

sought to prove that the evidence led at the trial by way of Witnesses, particularly the

7

evidence of Captain Bandara of the Ganemulla Army camp was sufficient to prove

possession of the pistol, and that it was a Firearm within the meaning of the

Ordinance. The fact that specific oral evidence in relation to the recovery of the Pistol

was only provided by the arresting officers is significant.

Drawing attention of the court to Section 47 of the Evidence Ordinance which makes

the opinions of persons who are not experts relevant when it comes to identification

of hand writing, the learned DSG submitted that the evidence of Captain Bandara

should be considered with regard to the firearm in issue. In my view, the application

of Section 47 of the Evidence Ordinance relates to handwriting and handwriting alone

and by any stretch of imagination Section 47 cannot be applied to other fields where

expert opinion is required.

Judgement of the Court of Appeal

Their Lordships of the Court of Appeal have relied on the judgements in Sudubanda

v. The Attorney General [1998] 3 SLR 375 and Suduweli Kondage Sarath and Another

v. The Attorney General (decided on 26.10.1998) to hold that the non-production of

a material object is not necessarily fatal to a conviction and that a conviction can be

sustained upon the description of instruments in the hands of the accused by lay

witnesses respectively.

I will now consider the question of law upon which submissions were made by

Counsel.

Determination

In my opinion, while the non-production of material in the prosecution of offences

which only require a literal understanding of certain words or phrases may not be

essential, it is only logical that material which are provided specific interpretations by

legislation and form the pith and substance of the offence is sine qua non. The

rationale for this view lies in the fact that the nonproduction is merely a symptom of

the larger defect of the lack of evidence to prove the allegation that the pistol claimed

to have been possessed by the Appellants was of a nature, make, model and function

as that of an automatic gun or a repeater shotgun within the meaning of the

Firearms Ordinance. Their Lordships in the Court of Appeal have therefore been

remiss in failing to note this glaring defect of the impugned conviction.

8

The judgement of Sudubanda v. The Attorney General [1998] 3 SLR 375 merely

discusses the non-production of a material object in respect of an offence which did

not require the object to conform to a particular interpretation. For example, in

Sudubandas case [supra], the accused was prosecuted for Attempted Murder. The

Court drew a distinction between real evidence and oral evidence which may serve

to establish the use of such real evidence in the commission of the offence. In fact, the

Court referred to the rationale for the exclusion of real evidence from our evidentiary

regime as explained by Sir Fitzgerald Stephen, the author of our Evidence Ordinance.

Sir Fitzgerald Stephen in his speech in the Indian Parliament, in introducing the

Act, has stated categorically that he did not, in defining evidence, include real

evidence as part of the definition of evidence. He has said that omission was deliberate

and intentional so that the law in India would be different to the law in Great Britain...

However, in proviso 2 to section 60 of the Evidence Ordinance he has made provision

for the adduction of real evidence subject to a condition. Section 60 proviso 2 sets out

thus: Provided also that if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any

material thing other than a document, the court may, if it thinks fit, require the

production of such material thing for its inspection [at pages 377-378].

The proviso referred to in the above extract merely provides the Court the discretion

to call for a production, i.e.: real evidence, when it deems it necessary. The

prosecution in relation to Count 2 in the present case is for the possession of a firearm

without license whereby the specific firearm alleged to have been possessed by the

two accused is an automatic gun as defined by the Firearms Ordinance. Thus, the

consideration in Sudubanda is manifestly different to the consideration before this

Court. As stated before, what is crucially lacking in the present conviction is evidence

to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the pistol claimed to have been possessed

by the Appellants was of a nature, make, model and function as that of an automatic

gun or a repeater shotgun within the meaning of the Firearms Ordinance, which is

a fact- in- issue in the case, as opposed to the weapon used to cause the injury in a

case of attempted murder as referred to in Sudubanda [supra] . Therefore, the

conclusions drawn above are consonant with the views of Sir Fitzgerald Stephen.

Material which bears a literal meaning for the operation of law do not require the

establishment of their use by specific evidence are wholly distinctive from material

9

with a specific legal meaning-such as a gun as defined in the Firearms Ordinance.

Crucially, what both the learned High Court Judge and their Lordships in the Court

of Appeal have failed to note is that the Firearms Ordinance imposes what may be

referred to as the Straw Board Test to determine whether an ordnance is in fact a

gun. Per Section 2 of the Ordinance as amended, a gun is only a gun if any

barrelled weapon of any description from which any shot, pellet or other missile can

be discharged with sufficient force to penetrate not less than eight straw boards, each

of three-sixty-fourth of an inch thickness placed one-half of an inch apart, the first

such straw board being at a distance of fifty feet from the muzzle of the weapon, the

plane of the straw boards being perpendicular to the line of fire. Accordingly, if the

projectile fired from a weapon is not capable of penetrating the straw boards in the

manner set out above, the weapon would not fall within the types of Ordnances

regulated by the Firearms Ordinance. The evidence that a weapon so alleged to have

been possessed was in fact a weapon which falls within the definition of a gun as

aforesaid must be presented from an expert, who in cases such as these is ballistic

expert.

The aforementioned distinction does not have to be established, for instance, where a

person alleges that he was robbed at gun point and charged under Section 383 of the

Penal Code for Robbery with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt. Even if the

firearm is not produced, or no evidence is led to establish the make, model, function

or other specification of the firearm, the suspect may be convicted since the Penal

Code does not impose a specific interpretation for the word gun and therefore the

word only bears a literal meaning and does not carry a specific legal meaning.

It is to be noted that the Court of Appeal made the cardinal error in misdirecting itself

by failure to appreciate the distinction of the non-production of a material object

with that of lack of proof to establish a fact-in-issue. The failure on the part of the

prosecution here is not the non-production of the pistol alleged to have been

recovered from the Accused before court per se, but the lack of evidence to establish

that, what was recovered from the accused falls within the meaning of a a gun under

the Firearms Ordinance. Assuming that, as in the instant case, the firearm was

misplaced after it was forwarded and examined by the Government Analyst, yet the

prosecution could have proceeded, as then expert evidence would have been available

10

to ascertain this fact.

For the reasons stated above, I am of the view that the absence of evidence of a

ballistic expert [Government Analyst] is fatal to the conviction in respect of Count No.

2 and that it was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the 1st Accused-

Appellant-Appellant in SC Appeal No. 129/2018 and the 2nd Accused-Appellant-

Appellant in SC Appeal No. 128/2018 committed the offence of Possessing a Firearm

without a license punishable under Section 22(1) read with Section 22(3) of the

Firearms Ordinance as amended by Act, No. 22 of 1996. Accordingly, the conviction

of the Appellants on Count No. 2 of the indictment and the term of life imprisonment

imposed on them by the learned High Court judge are hereby set aside. The

convictions entered and sentences imposed on the other Counts are to remain intact.

Appeal allowed.
