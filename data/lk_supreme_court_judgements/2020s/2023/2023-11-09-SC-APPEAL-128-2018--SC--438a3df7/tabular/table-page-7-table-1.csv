"evidence of  Captain Bandara of the Ganemulla Army camp  was  sufficient to prove"
"possession  of  the  pistol,  and  that 
it  was  a  Firearm  within  the  meaning  of  the"
"Ordinance. The fact that specific oral evidence in relation to the recovery of the Pistol"
"was only provided by the arresting officers is significant."

rawing attention of the court to Section 47 of the Evidence Ordinance which makes"
"the opinions of persons who are not experts relevant when it comes to identification"
"of  hand  writing,  the  learned  DSG  submitted  that  the  evidence  of  Captain  Bandara"
"should be considered with regard to the firearm in issue. In my view, the application"
"of Section 47 of the Evidence Ordinance relates to handwriting and handwriting alone"
"and by any stretch of imagination Section 47 cannot be applied to other fields where"
"expert opinion is required."

The Attorney General (decided on 26.10.1998) to hold that the non-production of"
"a material object is not necessarily fatal to a conviction and that a conviction can be"
"sustained  upon  the  description  of  instruments  in  the  hands  of  the  accused  by  lay"
"witnesses respectively."
"I  will  now  consider  the  question  of  law  upon  which  submissions  were  made  by"
"Counsel."

etermination"
"In my opinion, while the non-production of material in the prosecution of offences"
"which only require a literal understanding of certain words or phrases may not be"
"essential, it is only logical that material which are provided specific interpretations by"
"legislation  and  form  the  pith  and  substance  of  the  offence  is  sine qua non.  The"
"rationale for this view lies in the fact that the nonproduction is merely a symptom of"
"the larger defect of the lack of evidence to prove the allegation that the pistol claimed"
"to have been possessed by the Appellants was of a nature, make, model and function"
"as  that  of  an  ‘automatic  gun’  or  a  ‘repeater  shotgun’  within  the  meaning  of  the"
"Firearms  Ordinance.  Their  Lordships  in  the  Court  of  Appeal  have  therefore  been"
"remiss in failing to note this glaring defect of the impugned conviction."
