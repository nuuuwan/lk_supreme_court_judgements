"with a specific legal meaning-such as a ‘gun’ as defined in the Firearms Ordinance."
"Crucially, what both the learned High Court Judge and their Lordships in the Court"
"of Appeal have failed  to note is that the Firearms Ordinance imposes what may be"
"referred to as the ‘Straw Board Test’ to determine whether an ordnance is in fact ‘a"
"gun’.  Per  Section  2  of  the  Ordinance  as  amended,  ‘a  gun’  is  only  ‘a  gun’  “if  any"
"barrelled weapon of any description from which any shot, pellet or other missile can"
"be discharged with sufficient force to penetrate not less than eight straw boards, each"
"of three-sixty-fourth of an inch thickness placed one-half of an inch apart, the first"
"such straw board being at a distance of fifty feet from the muzzle of the weapon, the"
"plane of the straw boards being perpendicular to the line of fire”. Accordingly, if the"
"projectile fired from a weapon is not capable of penetrating the straw boards in the"
"manner  set  out  above,  the  weapon  would  not  fall  within  the  types  of  Ordnances"
"regulated by the Firearms Ordinance. The evidence that a weapon so alleged to have"
"been possessed was in fact a weapon which falls within the definition of ‘a gun’ as"
"aforesaid must be presented from an expert, who in cases  such as these is  ballistic"
