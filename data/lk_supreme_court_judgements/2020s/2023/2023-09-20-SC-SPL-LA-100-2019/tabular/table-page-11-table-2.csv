"[Emphasis added]"
"The above proviso to Rule 2 has therefore conferred wide discretion on the Supreme Court to allow"
"a petitioner to file an affidavit, if the petitioner has reserved his right to file an affidavit, document,"
"impugned judgment, order or certified copy of the case record."
"However,  I  am  of  the  view  that  even  if  the  Petitioner  has  not  reserved  the  right  to  file  such"
"materials, the Supreme Court has a wide discretion to grant permission to a petitioner to file such"
"materials if the circumstances warrant granting such permission in the interest of justice."
"A  similar  view  was  expressed  in  Priyani  Soysa  v  Rienzie  Arsecularatne  [1999]  2  SLR  179,"
"where Wijetunga J in his dissenting judgement held that even the failure of the petitioner to obtain"
"permission of the court to tender a valid affidavit would not necessarily dismiss a case unless there"
"is a compelling reason to do so."
