"provision  which  states  that  the  affidavit  must  be  sworn  or  affirmed  only  before  a  consular  or"
"diplomatic officer if it is a foreign affidavit."
"I
f there is any relevance, it is Section 3(1) of the said Consular Functions Act. It is questionable"
"whether an affidavit falls within the term ‘any document’ contained therein as per the interpretation"
"given to the said term in the interpretation section of the said Act. However, certain parts contained"
"or  attached  to  the  affidavit  to  show  that  the  person  who  administered  the  oath/affirmation  is  a"
"qualified person may need verification by a proper authority."
"I
n my view, the validation contemplated in Section 3(1) is not to certify the truth of the contents"
"of  a  document  which  the  officer  is  not  the  author.  Even  if  the  officer  certifies  the  truth  of  the"
"contents,  it  becomes  hearsay.  Thus,  the  validation  contemplated  there  is  to  certify,  attest  or"
"authenticate the genuineness or the authenticity of the document to the effect that it has originated"
"from the correct or lawful source.  However, it does not create a bar to accept foreign affidavits. It"
"only provides for Sri Lankan citizens or any other person a mode to meet challenges to foreign"
"documents on the basis of authenticity, legality etc.  The Consular Functions Act does not say that"
"such certification, attestation or authentication must always accompany with the document when"
"it is tendered. It does not prevent one to provide the said certification or authentication when the"
"authenticity or genuineness or legality is challenged. In this matter as His Lordship has mentioned"
"in the draft judgment, certification has been tendered after the objection was raised. Now any doubt"
"to  the  authenticity  has  been  removed  as  per  the  law.  Now  there  is  no  hindrance  to  accept  the"
"affidavit from the day it was sworn or affirmed."
"I
n my view, there is nothing wrong with the affidavit per se as far as the formalities are concerned"
"or regarding its  validity  except  for the doubt  created by the objection whether it was sworn or"
"affirmed before a qualified person as per the laws of the relevant country. Such doubt cannot be"
"sustained after a copy with the certification is tendered."
"I
n other words, there was no defect in the affidavit in its making to reject or cure with amendments"
"but the challenge to the validity created through objections cannot hold water from the moment"
"the certification is tendered. Thus, I hold that there is a valid affidavit even to support the averments"
"in the petition."
