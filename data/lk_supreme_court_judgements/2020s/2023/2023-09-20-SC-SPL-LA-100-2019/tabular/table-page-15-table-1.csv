"supported in court even without an affidavit in terms of Rule 2 read with Rule 6 of the Supreme"
"Court Rules of 1990 to point out questions of law arising out of the impugned order itself."
"S
upreme Court Rules do not say that the affidavits mentioned in the said rules should be sworn or"
"affirmed in Sri Lanka or that the affidavits referred to in the said rules preclude affidavits executed"
"in  foreign  countries.    Sections  437  and  438  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  clearly  identify  the"
"possibility  of  executing  affidavits  in  a  country  outside  Sri  Lanka  before  a  person  qualified  to"
"administer oath or affirmation according to the law of that countries. The question is how a court"
"in Sri Lanka recognizes the person who administers oath or affirmation as a qualified person to"
"administer oath or affirmation in the relevant country. If the opposite party does not challenge the"
"qualification of the person who has administered oath or affirmation in the relevant  case, there"
"may not be an issue, but when there is a challenge, it may have to be established that it was done"
"before a person qualified to administer oath or affirmation in the relevant country. Even with regard"
"to an affidavit executed within the country, one can raise an objection that the oath or affirmation"
"was not administered before a Justice of Peace or Commissioner of Oaths recognized by our law."
"Once it is established that the Justice of Peace or the Commissioner of Oaths had the authority to"
"administer oath or affirmation, the affidavit is valid from the date it was made."
"T
he objection was raised in terms of the Sections 3(1) and 4(1) of the Consular Functions Act No.4"
"of 1981. Other than that, no provision that states the making of an affidavit in a foreign country"
"makes it ipso facto invalid or inadmissible in evidence has been brought to our notice. Further, no"
"other defect with regard to formalities in making of an affidavit has been brought to our notice."
"Section 4(1) of the Consular Functions Act considers Diplomatic/ Consular officers as Justices of"
"Peace  and  enables  them  to  act  as  a  Justices  of  Peace  in  administering  oath  or  affirmations."
"Affidavits  made  before  them  are  deemed  to  be  made  in  Sri  Lanka.  This  is  only  an  enabling"
"provision and it does not invalidate or make inadmissible other affidavits sworn or affirmed before"
"a person qualified to administer oath or affirmation in terms of the law of the relevant country. If"
"it is so interpreted to say that other affidavits sworn or affirmed in foreign countries are not valid"
"before  our  courts,  the  relevant  parts  of  sections  437  and  438  of  Civil  Procedure  Code  become"
"redundant.  On the other  hand, if this is  to  disregard other  affidavits made in  foreign  countries,"
"litigants living abroad or in foreign countries at a given time, who have to tender affidavits within"
"time limits, may have to face serious repercussions if there is no diplomatic/consular office within"
"a close distance. The law does not expect to do impossible things.  So, my view is that the said"
"Section 4(1) has no relevance to the matter at hand. Our attention has not been brought to  any"
