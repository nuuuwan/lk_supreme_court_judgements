ubmissions of the Respondent"
"The learned Additional Solicitor General for the respondents submitted that Rule 2 read together"
"with Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 1990 mandatorily requires that a petition in an application"
"for Special Leave to Appeal be supported by an affidavit."
"He further submitted that foreign affidavits tendered to court are not automatically recognized as"
"valid unless it conforms to the applicable laws. Moreover, in terms of section 3 (i) of the Consular"
"Functions Act, a foreign affidavit would only be recognized as valid in the courts of Sri Lanka, if"
"the document was certified by a diplomatic or consular officer, who is ex officio deemed to be a"
"Justice of the Peace for Sri Lanka."
"Accordingly,  it  was  submitted  that  the  affidavit  filed  by  the  petitioner  purported  to  have  been"

"as it has no consular authentication or validation by the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Japan."
"S

"The learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the preliminary objection raised"
"by  the  Respondent  cannot  be  sustained,  because  an  affidavit  in  support  of  a  petition  in  an"
"Application for Special Leave to Appeal is not mandatory. Rules 2 and 6 of the Supreme Court"

"document” only  where the application contains  allegations of  fact  which  cannot  be verified by"
"reference  to  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal.  The  learned  President’s  Counsel  further"
"submitted that in the instant application, the allegations of fact can be verified from the impugned"
"Order, and therefore the instant application does not require an affidavit or other documents."
"Without  prejudice  to  the  aforementioned  submission,  the  learned  President’s  Counsel  further"
"submitted that given the urgency of the matter, it would be frivolous and highly technical to insist"
"that all steps pertaining to the certification of a foreign affidavit be carried out at the point of filing"
"the petition for Special Leave to Appeal within the prescribed time frame."
