"S.C. /FR A/ No. 374/2017"
"The  Petitioner,  however,  averred  in  paragraph  31  of  his  petition"
"that “to my shock and surprise, I received a letter on 25.09.2017 from/through"
"the  12th  Respondent,  which  enclosed  a  further  letter  sent  to  me  by  the  1st"
"Respondent’s  predecessor  in  office  (dated  22.09.2017)  informing  that  I  had"
"been  transferred  with  immediate  effect  …”.    In  view  of  the  several  factors"
"considered in the preceding paragraph, this particular averment of the"
"Petitioner, claiming that he was ‘surprised’ to receive the transfer order,"
"could not be accepted as an accurate description of the events that had"
"taken  place.  Thus,  the  fact  that  Petitioner  had  prior  knowledge  of  his"
"impending  transfer  and  the  type  of  transfer  is  undoubtedly  evident"
