"S.C. /FR A/ No. 374/2017"
"transfer  and  made  only  as  a  measure  to  avert  the  situation  that  had"
"arisen due to the conduct of the Petitioner."
"In  support  of 
the  contention  of 
the  Petitioner 
that  he  was"
"transferred  out  illegally  by  the  1st  and  12th  Respondents,  alleging  that"
"they 
acted  mala 
fide,  with  ulterior  motives 
and 
on 
extraneous"
"considerations  due  to  ‘political’  pressure,  learned  President’s  Counsel"
"relied on the fact that the Respondents, in spite of an already concluded"
"preliminary 
inquiry  on 
the  allegation  of 
irregular  admissions  of"
"students, had more initiated a second preliminary inquiry on the same"
"unfounded  allegation, 
in  order 
to  somehow  rope 
in  him.  Learned"
"Counsel  further  contended  that  the  said  second  inquiry  was  initiated"
"due  to  political  interference  and  that  too  only  after  the  Presidential"
"Secretariat  had  directed  the  Respondents  to  conduct  a  ‘comprehensive’"
"investigation by “an experienced officer” (R12)."
"This contention shall be considered at the outset of this judgment"
"for its merits."
"The  12th  Respondent,  by  letter  dated  10.03.2017  (R1)  directed  a"
"Deputy Director of Education to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the"
"allegations of admission of students to Vidyartha College irregularly and"
"submit  a  report  along  with  his  recommendations.  The  said  Deputy"
"Director  of  Education  had  conducted  an  inquiry  on  the  same  day  and"
"submitted  his report  (R2). In  that report,  the  inquirer  had  identified  of"
"39  specific  instances  of  irregular  admission  of  students,  contrary  to"
"applicable circulars. The inquirer also made an entry, in the logbook of"
"the  school,  directing  that  no  student  shall  be  admitted  to  any  of  the"
"grades until further notice."
