Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff company filed this action against the defendant employee in

the District Court of Colombo seeking an order for the return of the share

certificate for 11,606 bonus shares in the plaintiff company and the sum of

Rs. 7,776.02 paid as dividends on those shares on the basis that the share

certificate was delivered and the dividend payment made by mistake. The

defendant filed answer denying the plaintiffs claim and made a claim in

reconvention seeking an order against the plaintiff for delivery of the original

share certificate and damages in a sum of Rs. 1 million for failure to allot

bonus shares and dividends after 1993.

After trial, the District Court answered the issues raised by the plaintiff

against the plaintiff and the issues raised by the defendant in favour of the

defendant and dismissed the plaintiffs action. The District Judge states in

several places of the judgment that the defendant is entitled to bonus shares

and dividends.

The District Judge answered inter alia the following issues in favour of the

defendant:

10) Has the plaintiff any legal right or status to

4 SC/APPEAL/125/2014

(I) refuse to allot the 11606 shares allotted to the defendant by the

Secretary to the Treasury?

(II) recall the 11606 Bonus Share Certificate No. 035411 issued to the

defendant?

(III) recall the dividend of Rs. 7776/02 paid to the defendant in 1992?

(IV) instruct the Central Depository System that the Bonus Share

Certificate No. 03541 for 11606 shares had been lost or stolen?

11) If issue No.10 is answered in favour of the defendant, is the act of the

plaintiff wrongful and illegal?

12) If issues 10 and 11 are answered in favour of the defendant is the

defendant entitled to

(i) an order of Court directing the plaintiff to issue the original share

certificate in respect of the 11606 shares issued by the Secretary to

the Treasury?

(II) an order of Court directing the plaintiff to withdraw the

instructions given to the Central Depository System that the 11606

Bonus Share Certificate issued to the defendant was lost or stolen?

(III) an order of Court directing the plaintiff to issue to the defendant

all dividends, bonus shares and rights issued by the plaintiff after

1993?

Having answered the above issues in favour of the defendant, the District

Judge, at last, states thus:

.

11606 11606 , .7776.02

. ,

5 SC/APPEAL/125/2014

. 11606 11606

.

This means the plaintiff need not pay dividends on those shares from 1993

until the date of the judgment. The District Judge is silent on damages

although she answered that issue (issue No. 12 quoted above) in favour of

the defendant.

Both parties appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal against the

judgment.

In the petition of appeal, the defendant sought the following reliefs from the

High Court:

(i) to vary that part of the judgment to entitle the defendant-appellant

to obtain all rights and dividends from the inception of the action

without limiting it to after the date of judgment,

(ii) to award damages in a sum of rupees one million (Rs.1,000,000)

being damages suffered by him for not being able to sell or deal with

his shares,

(iii) to award costs and such other reliefs as to the Court shall seem

meet.

6 SC/APPEAL/125/2014

The High Court dismissed the appeal of the plaintiff. In respect of the appeal

of the defendant, the High Court says counsel for the defendant informed

Court at the argument that he does not pursue the claim for damages.

Therefore the High Court has rightly not considered the claim for damages.

I quoted above the reliefs sought by the defendant before the High Court.

The claim for damages is the second relief sought by the defendant. That is

the claim not pursued by the defendant at the argument. The High Court

judgment is silent about the first relief the dividend issue which the

District Court denied from 1993 till the date of the judgment.

The plaintiff did not appeal against the judgment of the High Court to this

Court but the defendant did. Although this Court granted leave to appeal

on all three questions of law stated in paragraph 17(a), (b) and (c), at the

argument before this Court, learned counsel for the defendant informed

Court that the defendant confines himself to the question of law stated in

17(b), which reads as follows:

Have the Judges of Civil Appeal High Court erred in law in holding

that the petitioner is entitled to all shares under the two share

certificates but failing and or not giving a decision whether or not the

petitioner is entitled to the declared dividends attached to the said

shares?

The defendant claims that dividends were given to all other shareholders

but denied to him, except for the year 1993. It is not the contention of the

plaintiff at the trial or before this Court that dividends were not approved

by the Board of Directors and shareholders at the annual general meetings

and therefore the defendant is disentitled to them. The only submission

made by learned counsel for the plaintiff at the argument was that the

defendant in the prayer to the answer sought damages instead of dividends

and the defendant withdrew that claim before the High Court and therefore

7 SC/APPEAL/125/2014

the defendant is not entitled to dividends. I am unable to agree with that

line of argument.

A judgment has to be understood holistically, not piecemeal. The defendant

sought dividends for his shares by way of issues and the Court answered

those issues in the affirmative. Therefore the plaintiff cannot say that the

defendant did not claim dividends but only damages. The District Court

held that the defendant can retain paid dividends in a sum of Rs. 7776.02

until 1993 and that the defendant is entitled to dividends after the date of

the judgment but not entitled to dividends from 1993 until the date of the

judgment. No basis or reason whatsoever was given for this by the District

Court. A Court cannot come to such a conclusion without giving reasons.

The High Court failed to address that issue in the judgment possibly by

oversight. I set aside the finding of the District Court which denies dividends

for a specified period and answer the question of law above-quoted in the

affirmative.

The District Court shall enter decree recognising the defendants

entitlement not only to shares but also to dividends on those shares,

without limiting it to take effect from the date of the judgment. The

defendant is not entitled to damages but entitled to costs in all three courts.

The judgments of the District Court and the High Court are varied to that

extent. The appeal is allowed with costs.
