Samayawardhena, J.

The two Plaintiffs filed this action in District Court to partition the land

described in the schedule to the plaint among two of them and the 1st-3rd

Defendants. The contesting 3rd Defendant who is also a co-owner claimed

prescriptive title to the entire land. After trial, the District Court

dismissed the 3rd Defendants prescriptive claim and proceeded to

partition the land according to the pedigree set out in the plaint.

According to the plaint, the allocation of shares shall be as follows:

1st Plaintiff 8/24

2nd Plaintiff 8/24

1st Defendant 2/24

2nd Defendant 3/24

3rd Defendant 3/24

Total 24/24

SC/APPEAL/81/2013

The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal filed by the 3rd Defendant. This

Court granted leave to appeal to the 3rd Defendant against the Judgment

of the Court of Appeal on several questions of law. However, at the

argument, learned Presidents Counsel for the 3rd Defendant confined his

argument to one question of law: whether the Court of Appeal erred in

law when it held that there is no basis to interfere with the Judgment of

the District Court in respect of the devolution of title.

According to the pedigree of the Plaintiffs, there were four original owners,

namely, Marcelina, Pelis, Lusia and Andiris. The Plaintiffs state that

Marcelina transferred her share by Deed P1 to Philip, who is the father

of the plaintiffs, and thereby they became entitled to that share by

inheritance.

The Plaintiffs also state that Lusias share devolved on her widower

and three children, and they transferred that share to Philip and

Lawrence by Deed P2 and thereafter Lawrence transferred his rights also

to Philip by Deed P3 making Philip entitled to the entire share of Lusia.

The Plaintiffs claim Lusiaa share also through their father, Philip.

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 3rd Defendant

is that the Plaintiffs are not entitled to a share of the land by Deeds

P1-P3, and they are only entitled to 7/288 shares from Deed P1 and

another 7/288 shares from Deeds P2 and P3.

The 1st Plaintiff who gave evidence at the trial for the Plaintiffs has been

cross-examined on this point but the learned District Judge has not paid

attention to it in the Judgment, probably because in the Judgment he

mainly focused on the prescriptive claim of the 3rd Defendant.

However, by closer scrutiny of those Deeds, it is now clear that the

Plaintiffs are only entitled to 7/288 shares from Deed P1 and another

7/288 shares from Deeds P2 and P3, and not the entire share of

7

SC/APPEAL/81/2013

Marcelina by P1 or the entire share of Lusia by P2 and P3. That is what

is stated in those Deeds. The plaintiffs claimed title to a share of the

land solely based on those deeds, and not on any other basis.

The Court of Appeal is not correct when it held that there is no necessity

to interfere with the devolution of title as accepted by the learned District

Judge.

The correct shares should be as follows:

1st Plaintiff 7/288

2nd Plaintiff 7/288

1st Defendant 24/288

2nd Defendant 36/288

3rd Defendant 36/288

Unallotted 178/288

Total 288/288

The question of law upon which leave to appeal was granted is answered

in the affirmative. The learned District Judge will enter Interlocutory

Decree according to the share allocation set out above. The other findings

of the learned District Judge will stand. The appeal is allowed. No costs.
