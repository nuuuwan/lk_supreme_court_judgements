"An approximate translation of the above would read as follows:"
"“Other Government primary schools that the child could be admitted implies a"
"school that provides the learning medium the child has applied for, a girls’, boys’"
"or mixed school as appropriate for the child and a school that admits 10% or"
"more children of the religion to which the child belongs.”"
"(Emphasis added)"
"In  light  of  the  above,  it  is  evident  that  a  5-mark  deduction  under  the  ""Proximity  of"
