"Thereafter, the Petitioner, through her father, appealed to the 1st Respondent by letter"
"dated 20th November 2017 (marked “P10”). The grounds for the appeal were two-fold:"
"firstly, the Petitioner asserted the provision of proof of residence in light of the fact"
"that  her  elder  sister  was  attending  the  same  school,  as  per  section  6.1(b)(ii)  of  the"
"Instructions; secondly, the contention was raised that, within the administrative District"
"of Galle, there were no schools apart from Southlands College that offered non-Roman"
"Catholic Christianity, as per section 6.1(b)(iii) of the Instructions."
"Furthermore, the Petitioner, through her father, submitted a letter of objection dated"
"30th November 2017 (marked as ""P11"") to the 1st Respondent regarding the children"
"of the 5th, 6th, and 7th Respondents, who were ranked higher than the Petitioner in the"
"provisional list of successful candidates. The Petitioner alleged the use of fraudulent"
"letters and the ineligibility of these students to be classified as Christian candidates."
"The Petitioner contended that the 1st Respondent did not provide a response to the"
"Petitioner's  appeal,  as  stipulated  by  the  guidelines  outlined  in  section  10  of  the"
"Instructions issued by the Ministry of Education in the year 2018. Instead, the Petitioner"
"asserted that she was made aware of her unsuccessful candidacy only upon the display"
"of the final list of successful candidates on the Notice Board of Southlands College,"
"Galle by the 1st Respondent on 8th January 2018."
"The Petitioner further averred that the 1st Respondent had failed to adhere to clause"
"3.2  of  the  Instructions,  which  mandates  that  schools  vested  in  the  government,  in"
"accordance with the provisions of the Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Special"
"Provisions)  Act  No.  05  of  1960  and  the  Assisted  Schools  and  Training  Schools"
"(Supplementary Provisions) Act No. 08 of 1961, maintain the original ratio of students"
"belonging  to  different  religious  faiths  at  the  time  of  the  school's  vesting  in  the"
"government. In the case of Southlands College, Galle, the percentage of non-Roman"
"Catholic  Christian  students  was  determined  to  be  6.9%,  which  would  amount  to  16"
"seats if a total of 240 students were to be admitted."
