The instant case pertains to an Application filed in terms of Articles 17 and 126 of the

Constitution by the Petitioner, namely Darmaraja Nilithi Prasadi, a minor appearing

through her Next Friend, Guardian ad litem, namely Perumal Darmaraja (hereinafter

referred to as the Petitioner). The Petitioner sought redress in connection with an

alleged infringement of Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and

14(1)(e) of the Constitution by one or more of the Respondents to this Application.

The Respondents in this matter comprise the 1st Respondent, the Principal of

Southlands College, Galle; the 2nd Respondent, the Director of National Schools,

SC Appeal 63/2018 JUDGEMENT Page 4 of 11

Ministry of Education; the 3rd Respondent, the Secretary to the Ministry of Education;

the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Respondents, who are Parents/Guardians of students admitted

to Southlands College, Galle; and the 8th Respondent, the Attorney General, who has

been included as a Respondent in accordance with constitutional requirements.

This matter was supported before this Court on 9th May 2018, and leave was granted

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

Factual Matrix

The narrative of this case unfolds against the backdrop of the Petitioners pursuit of

admission by application dated 21st June 2017 to Grade One of Southlands College,

Galle for the academic year commencing on 1st January 2018. This application was

made on the grounds of the Petitioners affiliation with the Christian faith and under

the quota allocated for the admission of students belonging to said faith. The

Petitioner's application was supported by a letter issued by Rev. A. Ravindra Kumar,

the Superintendent Minister of Methodist Church, Galle Circuit, dated 23rd June 2017

(marked P5b), and a letter issued by the Cavalry Church dated 4th March 2017

(marked P5c), serving as evidence of the Petitioner and her family's Christian faith.

Subsequently, the Petitioners father was invited to participate in an interview to

appraise the qualifications of his daughter for admission to Grade One at Southlands

College, Galle by letter dated 2nd August 2017 and issued by the 1st Respondent

(marked P6).

Following the interview, the Petitioner was informed that her application had received

a total score of 75 marks. In particular, under clause 6.1(b)(iii) of the "Instructions

regarding the Admission of Children to Grade One in Government Schools for the year

2018," issued by the Ministry of Education (hereinafter referred to as the Instructions

and marked P4), the admissions application had scored 45 out of a total of 50 marks

under the Proximity of Residence category.

SC Appeal 63/2018 JUDGEMENT Page 5 of 11

Thereafter, the Petitioner, through her father, appealed to the 1st Respondent by letter

dated 20th November 2017 (marked P10). The grounds for the appeal were two-fold:

firstly, the Petitioner asserted the provision of proof of residence in light of the fact

that her elder sister was attending the same school, as per section 6.1(b)(ii) of the

Instructions; secondly, the contention was raised that, within the administrative District

of Galle, there were no schools apart from Southlands College that offered non-Roman

Catholic Christianity, as per section 6.1(b)(iii) of the Instructions.

Furthermore, the Petitioner, through her father, submitted a letter of objection dated

30th November 2017 (marked as "P11") to the 1st Respondent regarding the children

of the 5th, 6th, and 7th Respondents, who were ranked higher than the Petitioner in the

provisional list of successful candidates. The Petitioner alleged the use of fraudulent

letters and the ineligibility of these students to be classified as Christian candidates.

The Petitioner contended that the 1st Respondent did not provide a response to the

Petitioner's appeal, as stipulated by the guidelines outlined in section 10 of the

Instructions issued by the Ministry of Education in the year 2018. Instead, the Petitioner

asserted that she was made aware of her unsuccessful candidacy only upon the display

of the final list of successful candidates on the Notice Board of Southlands College,

Galle by the 1st Respondent on 8th January 2018.

The Petitioner further averred that the 1st Respondent had failed to adhere to clause

3.2 of the Instructions, which mandates that schools vested in the government, in

accordance with the provisions of the Assisted Schools and Training Schools (Special

Provisions) Act No. 05 of 1960 and the Assisted Schools and Training Schools

(Supplementary Provisions) Act No. 08 of 1961, maintain the original ratio of students

belonging to different religious faiths at the time of the school's vesting in the

government. In the case of Southlands College, Galle, the percentage of non-Roman

Catholic Christian students was determined to be 6.9%, which would amount to 16

seats if a total of 240 students were to be admitted.

SC Appeal 63/2018 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 11

Thereby, the Petitioner posited that her non-admission to Grade One of Southlands

College, Galle, is violative of Article 12, as the 1st Respondent failed to give regard to

clauses 3.2 and 6.1 of the Instructions.

Conversely, the 1st Respondent averred that as per section 7.0 of the School Admission

Circular No. 22/2017 (marked R1), 50% of the quota assigned for students of the

Christian faith was to be selected from those applying under the "Proximity of

Residence" category (comprising 8 students), and the remaining 50% was to be

selected from other categories (also 8 students).

The 1st Respondent further asserted that, for the admissions cycle of 2018, only 4

students of the Christian faith applied under the other admission categories for Non-

Catholic Christian students in terms of the Circular. Consequently, the remaining

unutilised quota (4 seats) was made available to students of the Christian faith applying

under the Proximity of Residence category, thereby increasing the total number of

possible applicants from 8 to 12 students, under the said category.

According to the 1st Respondent, the deduction of 5 marks under the Proximity of

Residence criteria from the Petitioners application stemmed from the 1st

Respondents assumption that Christudeva Balika College, Galle, which also accepts

students belonging to the Non-Roman Catholic Christian faith, was in closer proximity

to the Petitioners residence. Thereby, the application of the Petitioner scored below

the cut-off mark (79.75 marks) for Grade One admissions in the year 2018.

In February 2020, during the course of these proceedings, the Court was informed of

a vacancy on the list of successful candidates admitted to Grade One of Southlands

College, Galle due to the 9th successful candidate leaving the school in Grade Five. The

Petitioner, through her father and by letter dated 6th December 2022, requested for

the admittance of the Petitioner to fill this vacancy under the quota assigned to non-

Roman Catholic Christian students. The same had been refused by the school. The

Additional Solicitor General maintained that admitting the Petitioner to Grade Six of

SC Appeal 63/2018 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 11

Southlands College, Galle would transgress the provisions of the government Circular

No. 17 of 2023, dated 25th April 2023, which regulates the entry of students from

Grades Two to Eleven. This submission was made in light of the fact that the Petitioner

had not obtained sufficient marks to pass the Grade Five scholarship examination.

Analysis

I observe that it is an undisputed fact that the mandated percentage of non-Roman

Catholic Christian students to be admitted to Grade One at Southlands College, Galle

stands at 6.9% as per the provisions of the Assisted Schools and Training Schools

(Special Provisions Act) No. 05 of 1960, and the Assisted Schools and Training Schools

(Supplementary Provisions) Act No. 08 of 1961.

In the present case, this is administered by Section 4.2 of Circular No. 22/2017 which

states that:

1960 05 ( ) 1961

08 ( )

.

An approximate translation would read as follows:

In filling vacancies in schools vested to the government under the Assisted

Schools and Training Schools (Special Provisions) Act No. 05 of 1960 and Assisted

Schools and Training Schools (Supplementary provisions) Act No. 08 of 1961, the

proportion of children belonging to different religions at the time of vesting the

school to the government will be taken into consideration and the number of

vacancies in the said school shall be divided proportionately among different

religions and the categories.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner relied on M.K. Wijethunga and others vs. The

Principal Southlands College, Galle (SC/FR Application 612/2004, decided on

SC Appeal 63/2018 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 11

07.11.2005), wherein Shirani Bandaranayake J (as her Ladyship was then) observed

that, in terms of the extracts of the proceedings of the Methodist Church Synod held

in January 1969, there had been 53 Christian students out of the total of 760 students

at Southlands College, Galle working out a percentage of 6.9%.

However, it is prudent to inquire whether or not this stipulated ratio is to be maintained

beyond the conclusion of the admissions period. I will address this issue following the

examination of the 1st Respondents review of the admission applications.

The 1st Respondent conceded that the score allocated to the Petitioner was erroneous;

it was explained to this Court that the 5-mark deduction suffered by the said

application was grounded in the incorrect assumption that Christudeva Balika College,

Galle, accepted a quota of 10% or more of non-Roman Catholic Christian students.

Pertaining to clause 7.2.3 of Circular No. 22/2017, it is explicitly delineated that the

maximum marks under the "Proximity of Residence" category shall be awarded only if

the applicant's place of residence is substantiated and no other Government schools

with primary sections exist in closer proximity to the applicant's residence than the

school to which they have applied. In instances where other Government schools with

primary sections, suitable for the child's admission and in closer proximity to the place

of residence than the chosen school, are present, marks shall be deducted at the rate

of 05 marks for each such school.

The said clause further stipulates:

,

,

10% .

(Emphasis added)

SC Appeal 63/2018 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 11

An approximate translation of the above would read as follows:

Other Government primary schools that the child could be admitted implies a

school that provides the learning medium the child has applied for, a girls, boys

or mixed school as appropriate for the child and a school that admits 10% or

more children of the religion to which the child belongs.

(Emphasis added)

In light of the above, it is evident that a 5-mark deduction under the "Proximity of

Residence" category is applicable only if a school that admits 10% or more students

belonging to the candidate's affiliated religionin this instance, Christianityis

situated closer to the candidate's residence.

The 1st Respondent has admitted to erroneously deducting marks based on the

incorrect assumption that Christudeva Balika College, Galle, accepted a quota of 10%

or more of non-Roman Catholic Christian students. In fact, the actual figure of

accepted Christian students at that institution stood at a mere 2%. However, the 1st

Respondent has contended the reversal of this deduction, the cut-off mark would be

raised to 82.5 marks, while the recalculated score of the application submitted by the

Petitioner would amount to 80 marks, and thereby, the Petitioner would continue to

rank below the successful applicants admitted to Grade One.

At this juncture, it is important to clarify that this Court does not intend to question

nor intervene in the admission of the 12 successful candidates, based on the revised

cut-off mark of 82.5 marks following the rectification of the erroneous 5-mark

deduction.

Nonetheless, the Petitioners application was unsuccessful due to the fact that it did

not fulfil the requirements to be admitted. However, I observe that had the school

authority properly inquired into the allegation made with regard to the admission of

the children belonging to the 5th,6th and 7th Respondents, there would have been a

SC Appeal 63/2018 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 11

high likelihood that those students would have disqualified for admission under the

quota assigned to non-Roman Catholic Christian students, in which event the

Petitioners application and admittance would have been successful.

While I do not wish to delve extensively into the matter regarding the eligibility of the

applications of the children belonging to the 5th, 6th and 7th Respondents to Southlands

College, Galle, it is important to underscore that, notwithstanding the contentions of

the 1st Respondent to the contrary, it is indeed the duty of the school administration

to ensure the validity and accuracy of admissions applications and their accompanying

documentation before admitting students. Nevertheless, this Court refrains from

intervening in the ongoing education of the children of the 5th, 6th and 7th Respondents,

and thus, no order shall be issued in this regard.

Under these circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioners fundamental rights

to equality guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been violated.

Therefore, I direct the 1st Respondent, or the incumbent holder of the office of the 1st

Respondent, and the 3rd Respondent to admit the Petitioner in S.C. (F/R) 63/2018,

namely, Darmaraja Nilithi Prasadi, to the appropriate corresponding Grade of

Southlands College, Galle forthwith.

Application Allowed.
