"O
n  19th  June  1995,  the  2nd  Defendant  filed  Answer,  in  which  she  averred  that  the  1st"
"Defendant had obtained a loan of Rs. 50,000/= from her at an annual interest rate of 24%."
"As  security,  the  1st  Defendant  mortgaged  her  property  to  the  2nd  Defendant,  which  is"
"reflected in mortgage deed No. 8425. The 2nd Defendant alleged that the 1st Defendant"
"defaulted  re-payment  of  the  loan.  She  claimed  that  the  mortgage  given  by  the  1st"
"Defendant  in  her  favour  (mortgage  deed  No.  8425),  should  be  treated  as  a  primary"
"mortgage  and  hence  her  claim  against  the  1st  Defendant  should  gain  priority  over  the"
"claim of the Plaintiff against the 1st Defendant. The 2nd Defendant also prayed for a decree"
"against the 1st Defendant for the payment of Rs. 50,000/= to her, together with interest at"
"the rate of 24% till the date of judgment. As a means of recovering the said amount, the"
"2nd Defendant prayed for an order for the sale of the afore-stated property, and should"
"there be an amount remaining from the sales proceeds, payment of the sum due from the"
"1st Defendant to the Plaintiff."
