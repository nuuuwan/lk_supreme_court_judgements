"The learned district judge has arrived at the finding that the 2nd Defendant had through"
"Lasantha Stembo lent Rs. 50,000/= to the 1st Defendant (a part of which by cheque and"
"the  other  part  in  cash)  in  consideration  of  which  the  1st  Defendant  had  mortgaged"
"property to her, which transaction is depicted in mortgage deed produced marked “2V1”."
"I
n  view  of  the  foregoing,  the  learned  judge  has  answered  the  issues  in  favour  of  the"
"Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant. Accordingly, the learned judge of the District Court has"
"held that the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant are entitled to the relief prayed for by them."
"He has also concluded that the mortgage held by the 2nd Defendant is a primary mortgage"
"and subject to that the mortgage held by the Plaintiff is a secondary mortgage. He thus"
"ordered the sale of the property referred to in the schedule of the two mortgage bonds"
"(one and the same) for the recovery of the monies due from the 1st Defendant to the 2nd"
"Defendant and the Plaintiff."
"A
ppeal to the Court of Appeal"
"The 1st Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the judgment of the District"
"Court.  It  is  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  dated  10th  May  2019  pronounced"
"following  the  hearing  of  the  said  Appeal,  which  is  the  subject  matter  of  the  instant"
"Appeal."
"J
udgment of the Court of Appeal"
"The learned Justice of the Court of Appeal has approached this matter on the footing that"
"the issue to be determined is whether the two mortgage bonds “P1” and “2V1” are valid"
"and effectual. Having taken into consideration the oral evidence of the 1st Defendant on"
"the one hand and the evidence given by the Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant on the other,"
"the learned justice of the Court of Appeal has concluded that the documents marked and"
"produced as “P1” and “2V1” which are ostensibly mortgage bonds are shams and are"
"illusionary, fictitious and colourable instruments. In the circumstances, the learned Judge"
"has concluded that the 1st Defendant has neither initially mortgaged her property to the"
"2nd Defendant nor thereafter mortgaged the same property to the Plaintiff. In this regard,"
"the learned Judge has noted that Notary Public Lasantha Stembo had been operating a"
"clandestine ‘finance company’."
"T
he learned judge has further observed that when “2V1” was sought to be marked and"
"produced at the trial, counsel for the 1st Defendant objected to it. In that regard, it has"
"been  observed  that  the  position  of  the  1st  Defendant  was  that  what  she  signed  were"
"several ‘blank’ papers, and that she has contradicted the testimony of the 2nd Defendant."
