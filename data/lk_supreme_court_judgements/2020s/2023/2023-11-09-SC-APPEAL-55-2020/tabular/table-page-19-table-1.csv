"to admit the document, unless the document is forbidden by law to be received, and no objection"
"to its admission can be taken up in appeal.”"
"I
t is observable that Cinemas Limited v. Sounderarajan also does not deal with proof of"
"a document which comes within the scope of section 68 and furthermore, the judgment"
"makes no reference to the impact of either presenting or not presenting an objection to a"
"document when the party that produced the document seeks to close its case and read in"
"evidence the contents of the document."
"I
n  Samarakoon  v.  Gunasekera  and  Another  [(2011)  1  Sri  L.R.  149],  Justice  Gamini"
"Amaratunga  referring  to  proof  relating  to  four  deeds  produced  at  the  trial  ‘subject  to"
"proof’,  and  no  witness  having  been  called  for  the  purpose  of  proving  the  deeds  in"
"compliance with section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance, and when at the closure of the"
"case the contents of the deeds were read in evidence the opposing side having objected"
"and moved court to exclude such evidence, held as follows:"
"“In the course of giving evidence, if a witness refers to a document which he proposes to use as"
"evidence, it shall be marked in evidence. If the party against whom such document is sought to be"
"used as evidence, does not object to it being received in evidence, and if the document is not one"
"forbidden by law to be received in evidence, the document and its contents become evidence in the"
"case. On the other hand, if the opposing party objects to the document being used as evidence, it is"
"to be admitted subject to proof. When a document is admitted subject to proof, the party tendering"
"it in evidence is obliged to formally prove it by calling the evidence necessary to prove the document"
"according to law. If such evidence is not called and if no objection is taken to the document when"
"it is read in evidence at the time of closing the case of the party who tendered the document, it"
"becomes evidence in the case. On the other hand, if the document is objected to at the time when it"
"is read in evidence before closing the case of the party who tendered the document in evidence, the"
"document cannot be used as evidence for the party tendering it."
"A
 deed for the sale or transfer of land, being a document which is required by law to be attested,"
"has to be proved in the manner set out in section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance by proof that the"
"maker (the vendor) of that document signed it in the presence of witnesses and the notary. If this"
"is not done the document and its contents cannot be used in evidence.”"
"T
hus, it would be seen that, in Samarakoon v. Gunasekera and Another this Court has"
"insisted on strict compliance with the requirement of proof contained in section 68 with"
"regard  to  documents  which  the  law  requires  to  be  attested  (such  as  a  deed),  if  the"
"opposing  party  objects  to  the  document  when  it  is  initially  produced  (thus,  produced"
"‘subject  to  proof’)  and  the  objection  is  reiterated  when  the  party  who  produced  the"
