"course of proving his case at the time when its contents or purport are first immediately spoken to"
"by a witness. …” In the instant case, there is no challenge that the 2nd Defendant had not"
"complied with this requirement."
"T
he explanation to section 154 provides as follows:"
"“If the opposing party does not, on the document being tendered in evidence, object to its"
"being received, and if the document is not such as is forbidden by law to be received in evidence,"
"the court should admit it."
"If, however, on the document being tendered the opposing party objects to its being admitted in"
"evidence, then commonly two questions arise for court:"
"Firstly,  whether  the  document  is  authentic  –  in  other  words,  is  what  the  party  tendering  it"
"represents it to be, and"
"Secondly, whether supposing it be authentic, it constitutes legally admissible evidence as against"
"the party who is sought to be affected by it."
"The latter question in general is a matter of argument only, but the first must be supported by"
"such testimony as the party can adduce. If the court is of the opinion that the testimony adduced"
"for  this  purpose,  developed  and  tested  by  cross-examination,  makes  out  a  prima  facie  case  of"
"authenticity and is further of opinion that the authentic document is evidence admissible against"
"the opposing party, then it should admit the document as before."
"If, however, the court is satisfied that either of those questions must be answered in the negative,"
"then it should refuse to admit the document."
"Whether the document is  admitted or  not it should  be marked as soon  as any witness makes  a"
"statement with regard to it; and if not earlier marked on this account, it must, at least, be marked"
"when the court decides upon admitting it.”  [Emphasis added.]"
"I
t would be seen that section 154(1) contains a procedural requirement (as opposed to an"
"evidential requirement) as to the time at which a document should be tendered by a party"
"to  civil  proceedings  governed  by  the  Civil  Procedure  Code.  The  document  should  be"
"tendered by the party intending to use the document as evidence, when its contents or"
"purport are  first immediately spoken to by a witness.  The  ‘explanation’  to section 154"
"highlighted  above,  provides  guidance  which  is  imperative  for  the  court  to  follow,  on"
"what the court should do when a document is sought to be produced by a party. If the"
"opposing party does not object to the document being received, the court should admit"
"the document, unless the document is such that its production is prohibited by law."
"I
n view of the afore-stated ‘explanation’ to section 154 and the cursus curiae of civil courts,"
"the issue which arises for consideration is whether, if at the time the document is sought"
"to be produced the opposing party does not object to the document being tendered,"
