"In view of the attendant facts and circumstances of this case, what  is contemplated by"
"‘due execution’ is that the 1st Defendant signed deed No. 8425 as a consenting party (upon"
"a correct understanding of the contents of the mortgage deed) and that the signature of"
"the  purported  mortgagor  is  that  of  the  1st  Defendant.  Admittedly,  the  2nd  Defendant"
"(Appellant) did not take steps in terms of section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance to prove"
"the due execution of mortgage deed No. 8425. As stated above, the position advanced on"
"behalf of the 2nd Defendant is that it was not necessary for him to prove the deed in terms"
"of section 68, as the 1st Defendant did not initially object to the deed being produced in"
"evidence (when it was marked “2V1” and did not reiterate that objection when the 2nd"
"Defendant closed her case)."
