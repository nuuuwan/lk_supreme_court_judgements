"Provisions of the Evidence Ordinance contained in sections 61 to 65 though of no special"
"relevance to the instant case, are of importance to bear in mind, as in the scheme of the"
"law relating to proof of a document, it is necessary to first ensure that the document is"
"admissible  prior  to  proving  its  due  execution  and  thereby  inviting  court  to  treat  its"
"contents  as  evidence.  The  document  must  be  first  made  admissible,  and  thereafter  it"
"should be proved. To that extent, this Court takes note of the fact that it was not argued"
"either  at  the  trial  or  in  the  instant  Appeal  that  the  original  of  deed  No.  8425  or  an"
"authorized copy thereof was not produced. To that extent, the genuineness of the deed is"
"not in doubt and thus, the document is admissible."
