"the  defendant.  However,  when  the  plaintiff  closed  his  case  and  read  in  evidence  the"
"contents of the deed, the defendant did not reiterate his objection to the production of the"

xpressing  the  majority  view,  Justice  Sisira  de  Abrew  quoting  Marian  v.  Jethuthasan"
"held that as the defendant was not known to the Notary and as the witnesses were not"
"known to the defendant either, the Notary could not vouch for the due execution of the"
"deed by the defendant. Therefore, the Notary Public cannot be regarded as an attesting"
"witness. In the circumstances, Justice de Abrew held that the deed in issue had not been"
"proved in terms of section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance. He observed that “… although a"
"document is produced in court with or without objection, it cannot be used as evidence if it is not"
"proved. If the principle enunciated in Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another v. Jugolinija Boal"
"East is accepted in respect of deeds, even a fraudulent deed marked subject to proof can be used as"
"evidence  if  it  is  not  objected  by  the  opposing  party  at  the  close  of  the  case  of  the  party  which"
"produced it. In such a situation, one can argue that courts will have to disregard section 68 of the"
"Evidence Ordinance. … Whether the opposing party takes up an objection or not to a deed which"
"is sought to be produced, the courts will have to follow the procedure laid down in law. … when a"
"document which is required to be proved in accordance with the procedure laid down in section 68"
"of the Evidence Ordinance is produced in evidence subject to proof but not objected to at the close"
"of the case of the party which produced it, such a document cannot be used as evidence by courts"
"if  it  is  not  proved  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  laid  down  in  section  68  of  the  Evidence"
"Ordinance.  …   failure on the part of  a party to object to a document during the trial does  not"
"permit court to use the document as evidence if the document which should be proved in accordance"
"with the procedure laid down in section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance has not been proved.”. In"

"E.A.G.R. Amarasekara quoting the legal maxim cursus curiae est lex curiae (“the practice of"
"court is the law of the court”) held that if a particular practice of court is not inconsistent"
"with a rule laid down by a statute or a long-standing practice or usage, that practice has"
"the  force  of  law.  He  highlighted  the  importance  of  not  invalidating  in  Appeal,  long-"
"standing practices of original courts, as such rulings could have far-reaching and serious"
"implications  and  repercussions  to  litigants.  Citing  several  judgements  of  the  Supreme"
