(page 307) Thus, based upon the above dicta, this Court sees no merit in the submission of the appellants regarding the variation of extent given in the schedule to the plaint and the extent depicted in the court commissioners plan. We are of the view, that the ancient and traditional sowing extent of grain and the modern measurement of actual extent of land cannot be compared per se since numerous other factors (i.e., the terrain, the fertility of the soil, size and quality of the grain and various modes and methods of cultivation) have a bearing on the sowing extent. Thus, ancient sowing extent cannot be considered in its strict form and a leverage ought to be given for variation when corelated to present-day measurements. Further, we are of the view, that even if the trial court came to a finding that extents vary, that factor alone will not vitiate rejection of the plaint and judgement be given in favour of the appellants, as there are many other items of evidence that should be considered in deciding on the identity of a land to be partitioned.",
