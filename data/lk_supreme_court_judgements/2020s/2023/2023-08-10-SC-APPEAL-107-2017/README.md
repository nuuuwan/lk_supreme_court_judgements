Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff company filed this action in the District Court of Mount

Lavinia against the two defendants seeking to recover a sum of Rs.

809,991.13 with interest arising out of the Lease Agreement marked P4.

The defendants filed answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action and

made a claim in reconvention for a sum of Rs. 428,684 on unjust

enrichment. After trial, the District Court dismissed the plaintiffs action

as well as the defendants claim in reconvention. Being dissatisfied with

the judgment of the District Court, the plaintiff appealed to the High

Court of Civil Appeal of Mount Lavinia. The High Court of Civil Appeal set

aside the judgment of the District Court and entered judgment for the

plaintiff. Hence this appeal by the defendants. This Court granted leave

to appeal on the question whether the plaintiff is legally entitled to recover

the balance due arising out of the Lease Agreement after its termination.

There is no dispute that the defendants entered into the Lease Agreement

P4 dated 24.10.1997 with the plaintiff company. Under the terms of the

Lease Agreement the defendant-lessees agreed to pay the plaintiff-lessor

48 monthly lease rentals of Rs. 48,219 each and take the Minor

Passenger Bus on lease. Although the leased vehicle was in the

possession of the defendants for 29 months, they only paid a total of Rs.

4

SC/APPEAL/107/2017

977,035 as rental fees. The defendants were admittedly in default (as

seen from paragraph 14 of the answer and P8).

If there is a default, 4% monthly overdue interest is added to the amount

due (as stated in item 5 of the schedule to the Lease Agreement).

Since arrears were not settled, the Lease Agreement was terminated by

the plaintiff by P9 dated 27.03.2000 and the leased vehicle was

repossessed and thereafter sold for a sum of Rs. 850,000 on 05.04.2000.

The position of the plaintiff is that as at 15.08.2000, the defendants were

obliged to pay the plaintiff a sum of Rs. 809,991.13 (as seen from the

statement of account marked P14).

The contention of learned counsel for the defendants before this Court is

that, once the Lease Agreement is terminated, the plaintiff cannot recover

future rentals but can only seek damages for the breach of contract. This

is the crux of the matter.

In my view, this contention is unsustainable in view of the terms of the

Lease Agreement the parties have agreed upon. Let me explain.

In terms of Article 5(1)(a) of the Lease Agreement, if Lessee fails to make

due and effective payment of any rent as and when it falls due or of any

other sum payable by Lessee as provided for in this Agreement after such

sum becomes due and payable, he is considered as a defaulter.

Article 5(2) reads as follows:

In the event of Lessee being in breach of this Agreement as

aforesaid Lessor shall have the right to exercise one or more or all

the following remedies without having to give any prior notice or

demand to Lessee:-

5

SC/APPEAL/107/2017

(a) the Lessor to receive immediate payment from Lessee of a part or the

entire amount of the total rent payable under this Lease Agreement

for the full term of the lease and all other costs and expenses

incurred by Lessor in this connection together with interest thereon

at the rate specified in item (11) of the Schedule to this Agreement

from the date of default less the amount of the rent paid by Lessee

and duly received by Lessor under this Lease Agreement.

(b) to make a written demand to Lessee for the return of Property and

to take possession of Property and to sell any or all of the said

Property by public auction or private treaty without notice to Lessee

or hold, use, operate, lease or otherwise dispose of or deal with such

property as Lessor pleases. Lessee agrees that within 7 days of

receipt of such written demand from Lessor for the return of Property,

Lessee will return Property to Lessor in accordance with the

provisions of Article 23 and if Lessee fails to return Property as

aforesaid the provisions of Article 23 shall become applicable

immediately.

Lessee further agrees that should Lessee fail to return Property to

Lessor within 7 days of receipt of a written demand from Lessor for

the return of Property, in the same condition Lessee received it, fair

wear and tear excepted, Lessee will pay and will be liable to pay

Lessor the market value of Property in fair and marketable condition.

(c) To terminate the Lease hereby created and to receive from Lessee

compensation for all indirect and consequential damages including

loss of profits and in particular loss of profits in the event of Lessor

consequent to the termination of the Lease Agreement suffering loss

as a result of being unable to re-let Property at a rental equivalent to

the rental payable under this Lease Agreement.

6

SC/APPEAL/107/2017

(d) to exercise any other right or remedy available to Lessor in Law.

This is repeated in the schedule to the Lease Agreement (which includes

the payment plan) where it states: Failure to comply with any of the above

provisions shall entitle Lessor to all or any of the remedies provided for in

Article 5 hereof [quoted above].

Learned counsel for the defendants relies on Article 5(2)(c) quoted above

to contend that, after the plaintiff terminated the Lease Agreement, the

plaintiff can only seek compensation/damages for loss of profit, and the

plaintiff is not entitled to recover the balance due amount in terms of the

Lease Agreement. This argument presupposes that the balance due

amount in terms of the Lease Agreement (a sum of Rs. 809,991.13 as at

15.08.2000) comprises only profit, but this has not been established.

In terms of Article 5(2)(a) quoted above, when there is a default in

payment of any rent as and when it falls due or any other sum payable

by the lessee, the lessor shall have the right to receive immediate payment

from the lessee the entire amount of the total rent payable under the

Lease Agreement for the full term of the lease. The lessor has the right to

do it without terminating the Lease Agreement.

In terms of Article 5(2)(c), if the lessor terminates the Lease Agreement,

the lessor shall have the right to claim compensation for all indirect and

consequential damages including loss of profits. Indirect and

consequential damages would not include damages which arise naturally

upon the breach of the Agreement. Loss of future rentals to my mind is a

natural consequence of the breach of the Lease Agreement. The issue of

whether future rentals include profits, and what proportion of future

rentals is attributable to profits, has not been, as I stated earlier, clarified

before this Court.

7

SC/APPEAL/107/2017

Article 5(2)(5) is also relevant in this regard. It reads: Even if the remedies

provided for in sub-paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) of this Article have been taken

by Lessor, Lessee shall not be relieved from any other liability under this

Lease Agreement including liability for damages. This goes to show that,

when there is a breach, a claim for damages has no direct bearing on the

right of the lessor to claim the total rent payable under the Lease

Agreement for the full term of the lease. It may be noted that, in the

instant case, although the plaintiff has terminated the Lease Agreement,

the plaintiff does not seek compensation or damages from the defendants.

Let us assume that the plaintiff seeks damages upon termination. Then

Article 5(3) also becomes relevant. It reads: Lessee agrees that the sums

due under this Article to Lessor are provided as liquidated damages for

breach of contract and not as a penalty. Liquidated damages are pre-

determined damages set at the time of entering into the contract upon

reasonable prior estimation of the damage which is likely to occur to the

injured party. Liquidated damages are meant to be compensatory rather

than punitive. Learned counsel for the defendant does not say that this

Article is a spurious one intended to disguise its true nature and purpose.

Instead, learned counsel accepts that unconditionally accrued rights,

fixed sums payable under the contract in respect of performance rendered

prior to breach, and causes of action which have accrued because of a

breach, are also unaffected by termination. As I stated earlier, in terms

of Article 5(2)(a), a cause of action accrues to the lessor, before the

termination of the Lease Agreement, to receive immediate payment from

the lessee the entire amount of the total rent payable under the Lease

Agreement for the full term of the lease when there is a default in payment

of any rent as and when it falls due.

Let me re-emphasise that at the time of entering into the Lease

Agreement, the parties have agreed to these terms. Although I accept that

8

SC/APPEAL/107/2017

freedom of contract is not absolute and enforcement is subject to

countervailing reasons of public policy, illegality etc., the general rule is

that, the parties must have the freedom to incorporate remedies into their

terms of contract, and general principles would apply only in the event

there are gaps.

Before I part with this judgment, let me explain the position taken up by

the defendant in his answer when he claimed Rs. 428,684 from the

plaintiff as a claim in reconvention. He admits that according to the Lease

Agreement he had to pay 48 monthly instalments of Rs. 48,219 each and

the total amount payable was Rs. 2,314,512 (Rs. 48,219 X 48=Rs.

2,314,512). He says he kept the vehicle 29 months and therefore he had

to pay Rs. 1,398,351 (Rs. 48,219 X 29=Rs. 1,398,351) but paid only Rs.

977,035 and therefore the balance due at the end of 29 instalments was

Rs. 421,316 (Rs. 1,398,351-Rs.977,035=Rs.421,316). Then he says the

vehicle was sold for Rs. 850,000 and when Rs. 421,316 is deducted from

that amount, the balance money of Rs. 428,684 should be returned by

the plaintiff to him. It is on this basis the defendant makes a claim in

reconvention for a sum of Rs. 428,684. At the trial, the defendant raised

issues and the plaintiffs witnesses were cross-examined on this basis.

This is a laymans approach and definitely not an approach to be adopted

in the interpretation of a Commercial Lease Agreement, to say the least.

Defaults on Lease Agreements can have a detrimental effect on finance

companies, as they may result in a loss of revenue and potentially impact

the companys ability to make further investments. In order to ensure the

financial stability of such companies, it is important to uphold the terms

of Lease Agreements and permit finance companies to recover balance

dues to the extent legally possible in the Agreement. This also supports

the broader economic goals of maintaining a stable and prosperous

financial sector.

SC/APPEAL/107/2017

For the aforesaid reasons, on the facts and circumstances of the case, I

hold that the termination of the Lease Agreement does not prevent the

plaintiff from claiming the defendants the total rent payable under the

Lease Agreement for the full term of the lease.

I answer the question of law on which leave to appeal was granted in the

affirmative and dismiss the appeal without costs.

However, since it has taken a very long time to see a finality of this matter

from the date of the High Court judgment, for which the defendants are

not singularly responsible, on the facts and circumstances of this

particular case, I think, it is fit and proper and equitable to limit the

reliefs of the plaintiff to the date of the High Court Judgment. I am

persuaded to adopt this approach by following the observations made by

Prasanna Jayawardena J. in Seylan Bank Limited v. Epasinghe

(SC/CHC/39/06, SC Minutes of 01.08.2017). Let the District Court enter

judgment accordingly.
