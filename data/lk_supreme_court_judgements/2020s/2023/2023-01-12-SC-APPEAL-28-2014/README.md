The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Matara to partition

the land known as Excluded portion of Punchipathagewatta bearing

assessment number 11 described in the second paragraph of the plaint

4 SC/APPEAL/28/2014

between the plaintiff and the 1st defendant. The 2nd and 3rd defendants,

two siblings, have been made parties to the action as they dispute the

plaintiffs rights to the land. After trial, the District Court dismissed the

plaintiffs action on the basis that the 3rd defendant has prescribed to the

land. On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal affirmed the judgment of

the District Court and dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff has filed this

appeal against the judgment of the High Court. This Court granted leave

to appeal against the judgment of the High Court on the following

questions of law as formulated by learned counsel for the plaintiff:

a) Did the Honourable Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals of the Southern Province (Holden in Matara) err in not

considering an all important item of evidence, the complaint

marked IV2 and the existence of the Western boundary shown in

Plan No. 1318A marked X, which nullifies the finding of the

Learned trial Judge as to the possession of the subject matter of

this action as part of the adjoining land pertaining to lot A of land

called Punchipathagewatta?

b) Did the Honourable Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals of the Southern Province (Holden in Matara) err in

holding that the learned District Judge is correct in holding that

the 3rd Defendant has prescribed to the subject matter of this

action by being in possession of the subject matter of this action

as part of the adjoining land pertaining to lot A of land called

Punchipathagewatta?

c) Did the Honourable Judges of the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeals of the Southern Province (Holden in Matara) err in not

considering that once the paper title to the subject matter of this

action is proved to be with the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant the

burden of proving the prescriptive right to the subject matter of

this action as a distinct and separate land within the meaning of

5 SC/APPEAL/28/2014

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is with the 3rd Defendant

which the 3rd Defendant has failed to do even on the finding of

the Learned trial Judge as to the possession of the subject matter

of this action?

There is no corpus dispute in this case but the District Court has

confined the corpus to lot 1 in the preliminary plan marked X. Learned

counsel for the plaintiff does not contest this finding. There had been a

dispute on the pedigree but the District Court has resolved it in favour of

the plaintiff. However the District Court has dismissed the plaintiffs

action on the basis that the 3rd defendant possessed the corpus (i.e. lot 1

in plan X) together with lots 3 and 4 in the same plan as part of lot A of

Punchipathagewatta bearing assessment number 11 which lies adjoining

the land to be partitioned. It is common ground that lot A of

Punchipathagewatta bearing assessment number 11 is possessed by the

contesting defendants or their people, not by the plaintiff or the 1st

defendant.

The plaintiff describes the disputed land as a burial ground but admits

in evidence that no one has been buried there in her lifetime. She was 46

years old at the time of giving evidence. She has not witnessed any burials

there although she says her deceased father had told her that some of

her forefathers were buried there. There are no tombs. There is nothing

to look after or possess. It is a bare land. The plaintiff in her evidence

says when her father, the original plaintiff, was alive, he used to clean

the land. The District Court has not believed this evidence. If what the

plaintiff says in relation to possession is correct, they could have at least

put up a fence separating that portion from lot A of Punchipathagewatta

bearing assessment number 11. This has not been done.

According to the complaint made by the original plaintiff to the

Gramasewa Officer marked 1V2, which the plaintiff strongly relies on

6 SC/APPEAL/28/2014

(vide the first question of law reproduced above), the 2nd defendant is in

possession of the land on the northern boundary of the disputed land

and the 2nd defendant put up a fence joining the disputed portion of the

land to her land on or around 24.05.1989. That is the complaint. The

plaintiff does not ask the Gramasewa Officer to hold an inquiry into his

complaint. He did not make a police complaint either. After this alleged

incident, he filed this partition action on 18.08.1989. If the original

plaintiff had been in possession of the disputed portion of the land for a

long time and if the 2nd defendant forcibly evicted him by erecting a fence

around that portion and joining that portion to her land, a reasonable

person in my view would have acted differently. Be that as it may, if what

the plaintiff says in 1V2 is correct, until such time, the disputed portion

did not have a fence separating it from lot A of Punchipathagewatta

bearing assessment number 11. This supports the assertion of the 2nd

and 3rd defendants, which was accepted by the District Court, that they

possessed the disputed portion of the land as part of lot A of

Punchipathagewatta bearing assessment number 11 as one allotment.

According to the preliminary plan, there is no fence on the northern

boundary of the land although the other three boundaries have fences.

There is a foundation on the northern boundary. This seems to be a

construction by the 2nd and 3rd defendants.

Neither the plaintiff nor her father has ever paid assessment rates to the

Municipal Council in relation to the corpus but the 3rd defendant and her

father have. Learned counsel for the plaintiff contends that although the

3rd defendant may have paid rates on assessment number 11, the land

for the partition of which the action was filed is not assessment number

11. This is contrary to the evidence of the plaintiff. She has accepted in

evidence that assessment number 11 is the land in dispute. It is in that

context that the District Court has made the finding that the 3rd

defendant and her father have paid taxes on assessment number 11

7 SC/APPEAL/28/2014

including the disputed portion. Learned counsel also contends that rates

are not levied on burial grounds. Although the plaintiff identifies this as

a burial ground, it is no longer used for that purpose.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff, either in the written submissions or oral

submissions, does not give any acceptable cogent reason for this Court

to reverse the judgment of the District Court. The judgment of the District

Court is a well-considered one. On the facts and circumstances of this

case, the finding of the District Court which was affirmed by the High

Court that, on a balance of probability, the 3rd defendant has acquired

prescriptive title to lots 1, 3 and 4 in plan X, is justifiable. I answer the

questions of law upon which leave has been granted against the plaintiff

and dismiss the appeal but without costs.
