"Petitioner was subjected to. Although the Petitioners have pleaded in the prayer to"
"the application that a copy of the bed head ticket, the treatment sheet and the medical"
"reports in respect of the 2nd Petitioner be called for from the Medical Superintendent,"
"General Hospital, Chilaw, the Petitioners have not pursued this prayer. Yet again, this"
"lacuna  may  have  been  overcome,  at  least  to  some  extent,  had  the  2nd  Petitioner"
"produced the four complaints /  statements that she made on 20th December 2017,"
"where she may have referred to the assault and the injuries she alleges she sustained"
"as a result of the incidents that took place the day before. The failure to produce any"
"form of medical evidence to support the allegation of assault or take meaningful steps"
"to procure such material, in spite of the 2nd Petitioner claiming that such material is"
"available is a cause for concern."
