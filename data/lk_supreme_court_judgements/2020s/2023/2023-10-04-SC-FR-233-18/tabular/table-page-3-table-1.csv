"Although this application has been filed seven months after the alleged infringement,"
"the Petitioners have filed a complaint with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka"
"the  day  after  the  occurrence  of  the  incidents  complained  of.  Article  126(2)  of  the"
"Constitution  stipulates  that  an  application  must  be  filed  within  one  month  of  the"
"alleged  infringement,  and  on  the  face  of  it,  it  is  clear  that  the  Petitioners  have  not"
"complied  with  such  requirement.  However,  Section  13(1)  of  the  Human  Rights"
"Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 21 of 1996 provides that, “Where a complaint is made"
"by an aggrieved party in terms of section 14, to the Commission, within one month of"
"the alleged infringement or imminent infringement of a fundamental right by executive"
"or  administrative  action,  the  period  within  which  the  inquiry  into  such  complaint  is"
"pending  before  the  Commission,  shall  not  be  taken  into  account  in  computing  the"
"period of one month within which an application may be made to the Supreme Court"
"by such person in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution.” The learned Counsel for"
"the Respondents did not raise any objection with regard to the maintainability of this"
"application for non-compliance with the provisions of Article 126(2) probably in view"
"of the said provision and for that reason, the necessity for this Court to go into the"
"issue of time bar or whether Section 13(1) applies to this application, does not arise."
