"Affidavit of Dayaratne"
"I
 must nonetheless consider if the allegations of brutal assault that Damayanthi claims"
"the 2nd Petitioner was subjected to, can yet be established. In that regard, there are"
"two matters that  I must consider. The first is the affidavit of  Lekamlage  Dayaratne,"
"which had only been tendered with the counter affidavit of the 2nd Petitioner, although"
"it had been affirmed one month prior to the filing of this application and was available"
"to the Petitioners at the time this application was filed."
