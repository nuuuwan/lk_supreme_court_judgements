"‘Human dignity is the central argument for the existence of human rights. It is"
"the rationale for them all. It is the justification for the existence of rights.’ ‘The"
"constitutional  value  of  human  dignity  has  a  central  normative  role.  Human"
"dignity as a constitutional value is the factor that united the human rights into"
"one whole. It ensures the normative unity of human rights.’’ [emphasis added]"
