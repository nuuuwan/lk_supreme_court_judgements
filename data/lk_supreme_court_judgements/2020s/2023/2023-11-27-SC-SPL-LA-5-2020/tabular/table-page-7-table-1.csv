"the High Court exercised appellate  jurisdiction, empowers a court that finds an accused"
"‘guilty’  of  the  charge(s)  against  him  and  therefore  convicts  him,  to,  in  addition  to  the"
"imposition of the punishment prescribed for that offence, require the convicted accused"
"to  pay  compensation  to  the  virtual  complainant  (victim  of  crime) 
in  a  sum  to  be"
"determined  by  the  learned  Judge.  That  sum  shall  not  exceed  One  Million  Rupees  (Rs."
"1000,000.00). This order for the payment of compensation which a court may impose is a"
"penal measure by which the victim of a crime can receive  reparation in respect of the"
"offence  committed  against  such  party  and  the  loss  suffered.  It  enables  the  victim  to"
"receive compensation from the accused from the criminal justice system itself, without"
"having  recourse  to  the  civil  justice  system.  However,  an  order  for  the  payment  of"
"compensation  when  imposed  by  a  court  that  has  exercised  criminal 
jurisdiction  is"
"certainly a penal measure,  which is an extension to the punishment prescribed for the"
"relevant offence. That it is a penal measure similar to a fine is evident from the fact that"
"non-payment  of  compensation  ordered  can  attract  a  default  term  of  imprisonment.  It"
"should be noted that the offence for which the Accused – Appellant – Appellant had been"
"convicted had been committed on or about 29th October 2013. Whereas, as at that time,"
"Act No. 5 of 2015 had not been enacted. Hence, what the learned Judge of the High Court"
"has done amounts to the imposition of a penal measure retroactively. This violates Article"
"13(6) of the Constitution, which inter-alia provides that no penalty shall be imposed for"
"any offence more severe than the penalty in force at the time such offence was committed."
"In the circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the order made by the learned Judge"
"of 
the  High  Court 
for 
the  payment  of  compensation  of  Rs.  Rs.  1,862,490.00 
is"
"unconstitutional  and  therefore  unlawful.  Therefore,  that  component  of  the  order  of"
"sentence appearing at pages 6 and 7 of the impugned judgment of the High Court dated"
"29th November 2019 cannot stand and therefore needs to be set aside."
