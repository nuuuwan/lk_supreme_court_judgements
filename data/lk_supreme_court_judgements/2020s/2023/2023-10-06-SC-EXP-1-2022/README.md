P Padman Surasena J

THE BACKGROUND

The Petitioner is a member of the 1st Respondent party, the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the SLMC). The SLMC is a political party recognized

under the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 01 of 1981 (as amended).

The 2nd Respondent and the 3rd Respondent in this case are respectively, the Leader and the

Chairman of the SLMC and are also members of the SLMCs High Command. The High

Command of the SLMC is the apex decision making body of the party.

According to the petition, the 4th-91st Respondents are also members of the High Command

of the SLMC. The 92nd Respondent is the Secretary General of the SLMC and the 93rd

Respondent is the Chairman of the Election Commission, while the 94th to the 97th

Respondents are all members of the Elections Commission.

At the General Election conducted in the year 2020, the Petitioner was elected as a Member

of Parliament from the SLMC and agreed to conduct himself as a member of the opposition in

line with the electoral pact of the SLMC. The Petitioner along with the 6th, 16th and 24th

Respondents had signed a document as members and representatives of the SLMC in

parliament pledging their loyalty to the constitution, rules and regulations of the SLMC. The

Petitioner himself has produced the said special pledge of loyalty to the constitution, rules and

regulations marked P5 with his Petition. The facts relevant to the instant case revolves

around the voting took place at the budget proposal (Appropriation Bill) for the year 2022

presented to the Parliament by the Hon. Minister of Finance on 12-11-2021. The second

reading of the said Appropriation Bill had been fixed for 22-11-2021. The SLMC had then called

an urgent meeting of the High Command to be held on 21-11-2022 which is the day prior to

the said scheduled second reading. This was for the purpose of deciding how members of the

SLMC should vote at the second reading of the said Appropriation Bill.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 18 of 62

It is the position of the SLMC that its High Command had decided at that meeting not to vote

in favour of the said Appropriation Bill in Parliament. The High Command had also decided

that the SLMC members could either vote against the said Appropriation Bill or abstain from

voting. The 1st Respondent has produced its decision marked 1R2. It is the position of the

SLMC that the Petitioner being aware of the aforesaid meeting and its unanimous decision

taken on 21-11-2021 had nevertheless proceeded to vote in favour of the said Appropriation

Bill on 22-11-2021 at its second reading, and at the third reading as well, in blatant violation

of the said decision of the SLMC High Command. The SLMC has alleged that the Petitioner

while holding a senior and substantial position in the party High Command has breached the

party decision.

The Petitioner admits that he was aware of the said meeting which was to be held on 21-11-

2022 to decide on the party position in the voting at the said second reading of the said

Appropriation Bill which was scheduled on 22-11-2021. However, the petitioner states that

upon being informed that the said meeting of the High Command was to be held on 21-11-

2021 at the party headquarters, he had duly communicated to the Secretary of the SLMC of

his inability to attend the said meeting and sought to be excused from the said meeting. It is

the position of the Petitioner that he was not informed of any such decision taken at the

meeting held on 21-11-2021 and therefore he had voted in favour of the aforesaid

Appropriation Bill at its second reading held in Parliament on 22-11-2021.

It was in the above circumstances, that the SLMC has called for a written explanation from

the Petitioner by the letter dated 27-11-2021 (produced marked P9) signed by the 8th

Respondent who is the Secretary of the SLMC. After the exchange of several other letters

between the SLMC and the Petitioner which I will refer to later in this judgment, the SLMC by

the letter dated 23-04-2022 produced marked P15, had communicated to the Petitioner about

his expulsion from the party. Thus, it is in the above backdrop that the Petitioner has filed the

Petition in the instant case in terms of Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution, praying in his

Petition for an order from this court to set aside and invalidate the SLMCs decisions to expel

him from the party as per letter P15 dated 23-04-2022.

JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT.

As the Petitioner has filed the Petition in this case under Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution,

let me at the outset reproduce that Article here.

Article 99 (13) (a)

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 19 of 62

(13) (a) Where a Member of Parliament ceases, by resignation, expulsion or

otherwise, to be a member of a recognized political party or independent group

on whose nomination paper (hereinafter referred to as the relevant nomination

paper) his name appeared at the time of his becoming such Member of

Parliament, his seat shall become vacant upon the expiration of a period of one

month from the date of his ceasing to be such member:

Provided that in the case of the expulsion of a Member of Parliament his seat

shall not become vacant if prior to the expiration of the said period of one month

he applies to the Supreme Court by petition in writing, and the Supreme Court

upon such application determines that such expulsion was invalid. Such petition

shall be inquired into by three Judges of the Supreme Court who shall make their

determination within two months of the filing of such petition. Where the

Supreme Court determines that the expulsion was valid the vacancy shall occur

from the date of such determination.

As the Petitioner in the instant case has prayed in his Petition for an order from this court to

set aside and invalidate the SLMCs decisions to expel him from the party, let me first clearly

identify the nature of the jurisdiction this Court must exercise under the above constitutional

provision over the impugned decision of the SLMC to expel the Petitioner from the SLMC. In

doing so, let me at the very commencement of this discourse, refer to the previous decisions

of this Court which had considered the nature of the jurisdiction this Court must exercise in

such cases.

In the case of Gamini Dissanayake Vs M. C. M. Kaleel and others,1 (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as Gamini Dissanayake's case), which this Court had decided on 03rd December

1991, eight members of the United National Party who were also Members of Parliament

had filed eight petitions in terms of Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution challenging their

expulsion from the Party.

Mr. H. L. de Silva, PC during the argument in Gamini Dissanayake's case, had cited many

cases relating to social clubs, trade unions and voluntary associations in which decisions for

the expulsion of their members had been struck down for want of a fair hearing. To the

contrary, Mr. K. N. Choksy PC had contended in that case, inter alia that the right to a hearing

is not an inveterate rule and depends on the facts and circumstances of the case and the

grounds on which disciplinary action has been taken. It was the contention of Mr. Choksy PC

in that case, that if the matter which the petitioner says he could have placed before the

1 1993 ( 2) Sri. L. R. 135.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 20 of 62

tribunal for consideration is a question of law or interpretation of statute or a rule or contract,

all such matters are questions which this Court must decide and therefore, the lack of hearing

does not vitiate the decision because the Court is in a position to adjudicate on them. Having

considered those arguments, Kulatunga, J. in the majority judgment of this Court in Gamini

Dissanayake's case, observed as follows:

The right of a MP to relief under Article 99 (13) (a) is a legal right and forms

part of his constitutional rights as a MP. 2

In Gamini Dissanayake's case, Fernando J in the minority judgment, stated the following on

the above arguments:

Our jurisdiction under Article 99(13) (a) is not a form of judicial review, or even

of appeal, but rather an original jurisdiction analogous to an action for a

declaration,3 though it is clearly not a re-hearing. Are we concerned only with

the decision-making process, or must we also look at the decision itself? Article

99 (13) (a) requires us to decide whether the expulsion was valid or invalid, some

consideration of the merits is obviously required. .. 4

The case of Tilak Karunaratne Vs. Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike and others,5 (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as Tilak Karunaratne's case), is a case this Court had decided on 27th

April 1993. The Petitioner Tilak Karunaratne who filed that petition in terms of Article 99 (13)

(a) of the Constitution challenging his expulsion from the Party was a Member of Parliament

belonging to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party who was duly elected at the General Election held

in 1989, to represent Kalutara District.

Mr. H. L. de Silva, PC who appeared for some of the respondents including the 1st respondent

Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike in Tilak Karunaratne 's case, contended that the jurisdiction of

this court does not extend to an examination of the merit worthiness of the expulsion as the

decision to expel the petitioner in that case was a political decision and therefore the criteria

adopted for expulsion may vary from case to case, person to person and time to time. Mr. H.

L. de Silva, PC in that case further submitted that this court could interfere only if the decision

of the expelling authority was unreasonable in the 'Wednesbury sense' (Associated Provincial

Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation)6 that is, if the decision is so unreasonable

2 At page 234. 3 Emphasis is mine. 4 At page 198. 5 1993 (2) SLR 90. 6 [1947] 2 All ER 680; [1948] 1 KB 223.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 21 of 62

as to be irrational. In that case, the learned counsel for the respondents relying on

the cases Dawkins v. Antrobus;7 Richardson - Gardner v. Freemantle;8 Maclean v.

Workers Union and others;9 and Hopkinson v. Marquis of Exeter;10 which were cases in

relation to expulsion of members from voluntary associations, sought to argue that if exercise

of the power of expulsion was made bona fide, this court should refrain from interfering with

it. Mr. H. L. de Silva, PC in that case had reminded the Court of the words of caution of the

great American Chief Justice, Marshall that 'judges should not enter the political thicket'.11

Rejecting the above argument, this Court in Tilak Karunaratne's case by its majority judgment,

has identified the jurisdiction this Court must exercise under Article 99 (13) (a) of the

Constitution in the following paragraph which has been quoted from the majority judgment

of Dheeraratne J.

The nature of the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court in terms of the

proviso to Article 99 (13) (a) is indeed unique in character; it calls for a

determination that expulsion of a Member of Parliament from a recognized

political party on whose nomination paper his name appeared at the time of his

becoming such Member of Parliament, was valid or invalid. If the expulsion is

determined to be valid, the seat of the Member of Parliament becomes vacant.

It is this seriousness of the consequence of expulsion which has prompted the

framers of the Constitution to invest that unique original jurisdiction in the

highest court of the Island, so that a Member of Parliament may be amply

shielded from being expelled from his own party unlawfully and/or capriciously.

It is not disputed that this court's jurisdiction includes, an investigation into the

requisite competence of the expelling authority; an investigation as to whether

the expelling authority followed the procedure, if any, which was mandatory in

nature; an investigation as to whether there was breach of principles of natural

justice in the decision making process; and an investigation as to whether in the

event of grounds of expulsion being specified by way of charges at a domestic

inquiry, the member was expelled on some other grounds which were not so

specified. .. 12

Having held as above, Dheeraratne J in that case, cited with approval the views expressed by

Fernando J in the minority judgment in Gamini Dissanayake's case with regard to the nature

of jurisdiction of this Court under Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution. Thus, Dheeraratne J

in Tilak Karunaratne's case stated as follows:

Our jurisdiction appears to be wider; it is an original jurisdiction on which no

limitations have been placed by Article 99 (13) (a). As stated by Fernando J. in

Dissanayake and others v. Kaleel and others, Our own jurisdiction under Article

99 (13) (a) is not a form of judicial review, 13

On 1st July 2005, a bench of five judges of this Court decided the case of Ameer Ali and others

Vs. Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and others,14 hereinafter sometimes referred to as Ameer Ali's

case. All five judges of this Court were unanimous in their conclusion. In that case, three

Petitioners who had contested the General Election held in April 2004, and returned as

Members of Parliament had filed the petitions in that case in terms of Article 99 (13) (a) of

the Constitution challenging their expulsion from the Party. The five Judge bench of this Court

proceeded to examine the nature of the jurisdiction of this Court with regard to the petitions

filed under Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution. The said five-judge bench in the judgment

of Court, also cited with approval (unanimously), the aforesaid views expressed by Kulatunga

J in the majority judgment of this Court in Gamini Dissanayake's case, as well as the aforesaid

views expressed by Dheeraratne J in the majority judgment of Tilak Karunaratne 's case,

regarding the nature of the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 99 (13) (a) of the

Constitution. Thus, in Ameer Ali's case, five judges of this Court have unanimously endorsed

the aforesaid views.

In Sarath Amunugama and others Vs. Karu Jayasuriya Chairman UNP and others,15

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as Sarath Amunugama's case), which this Court had

decided on 03rd February 2000, the five petitioners (whose cases were heard together) were

Members of Parliament representing the United National Party which is a recognized political

party. The petitioners in that case had filed applications in the Supreme Court in terms of

12 At page 101. 13 At page 102. 14 2006 1 SLR (at page 189). 15 2000 (1) Sri. L. R, 172.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 23 of 62

Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution as they had been summarily expelled from the

membership of the Party on a decision of the Working Committee of the Party. With regard

to the nature of the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution,

Amerasinghe J who was then Acting Chief Justice, in his judgment had cited and reproduced

with approval, Fernando Js sentiments with regard to the said jurisdiction of this Court

expressed in Gamini Dissanayake's case.

The Petitioner in Perumpulli Hewage Piyasena Vs. Illankai Thamil Arsukachchi and others,16

had filed that application in terms of the proviso to Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution

challenging his expulsion from the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK), which is a recognized

political party on whose nomination paper his name admittedly had appeared at the time of

his election as a Member of Parliament for Digamadulla District at the April 2010 General

Election. The learned Presidents Counsel for the 3rd Respondent in that case highlighted four

specific allegations of suppressions and misrepresentations by the petitioner in that case in

the course of his lengthy oral and written submissions before Court. The learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner in that case, too made detailed submissions to show firstly, that the

Petitioners conduct was bona fide and secondly, that it was in accordance with his obligations

to Court in relation to uberrima fides.

In Perumpulli Hewage Piyasenas case, Saleem Marsoof J also cited with approval, the

aforesaid views expressed by Dheeraratne J in the majority judgment of Tilak Karunaratne 's

case, regarding the nature of jurisdiction this Court must exercise in cases of this nature filed

under Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution, and went on to state as follows:

The jurisdiction of this Court conferred by Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution

is sui generis, original and exclusive, and does not confer any discretion to this

Court to dismiss in limine an application filed there under merely on the ground

of suppression or misrepresentation of material facts, as in cases involving

injunctive relief or applications for prerogative writs.17 As noted by Fernando, J.

in Gamini Dissanayake v. Kaleel and Others [1993] 2 Sri LR 135 at 198, it is not

a form of judicial review, or even of appeal, but rather an original jurisdiction

analogous to an action for a declaration, though it is clearly not a re-hearing.

As Dheeraratne, J. observed in Tilak Karunaratne v. Sirimavo Bandaranaike

[1993] 2 Sri LR 90 at 101.18

16 SC Expulsion No. 03/ 2010 (decided on 08-02-2011). 17 Emphasis is mine. 18 Page 6 of that judgment.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 24 of 62

Thus, this court in all the previous cases has consistently taken and maintained the position

that the nature of the jurisdiction this Court conferred on it by Article 99 (13) (a) of the

Constitution: is not a form of judicial review; is not even in the form of an appeal; is rather

an original jurisdiction analogous to an action for a declaration; is not a re-hearing; is indeed

unique in character and original in nature vested in the highest Court of the island; is a very

wide jurisdiction; is an original jurisdiction on which no limitations have been placed by Article

99 (13) (a); is sui generis; is original and exclusive; is a jurisdiction to determine the validity

or otherwise of an expulsion in terms of the proviso to Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution;

is neither injunctive nor discretionary; is indeed unique in character. I agree with the above

views consistently taken by this Court.

Thus, this Court is under a duty as empowered by Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution, to

examine the merits of the decision of the SLMC expelling the Petitioner from the party as the

Petitioner in the instant case has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court vested in it under Article

99(13)(a) of the Constitution.

EFFECT OF BREACH OF THE RULES OF NATURAL JUSTICE IN EXPULSIONS

The next question I would consider is as to what would happen when there is some breach

of the Rules of Natural Justice in particular, the Rule of Audi Alteram Partem. Let me refer to

the previous instances where this Court had considered this aspect when it had exercised its

jurisdiction under Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution.

In Gamini Dissanayake's case, Kulatunga J in delivering the majority judgment of this Court

observed as follows:

The right of a M.P. to relief under Article 99 (13) (a) is a legal right and forms part of

his constitutional rights as a M.P. If his complaint is that he has been expelled from

the membership of his party in breach of the rules of natural justice, he will ordinarily

be entitled to relief and this Court may not determine such expulsion to be valid unless

there are overwhelming reasons warranting such decision.19 Such decision would be

competent only in the most exceptional circumstances permitted by law and in

furtherance of the public good the need for which should be beyond doubt. ... 20

Kulatunga J in Gamini Dissanayake's case, had taken that view whilst being mindful of the

fact that any expulsion of a member from the party will visit the same consequence as any

19 Emphasis is mine. 20 At page 234.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 25 of 62

declaration that his election to Parliament is void or subject to any of the disqualifications as

are specified in the Constitution which would result in such member losing his seat in

Parliament. Nevertheless, it was Kulatunga Js view that when there is a complaint that the

relevant decision has been taken in breach of the rules of natural justice, even such decision

would stand competent in the presence of overwhelming reasons warranting such decision.

Such overwhelming reasons must be most exceptional circumstances permitted by law and in

furtherance of the public good the need for which should be beyond doubt.

Even in the minority judgment in Gamini Dissanayake's case, Fernando J having considered

all the relevant authorities before him, had recognized the fact that there are several cases

in which decisions have been allowed to stand although such decisions had been taken without

a hearing.21 Fernando J in that case had listed some of the categories to which such cases

belong: the instances where there is no legitimate expectation of a hearing; the instances

where a hearing becomes a useless formality; the instances where there is no injustice or

no real prejudice; the instances where there is urgency to take a decision; the instances

where there is discretion on the decision maker; the instances where there is a subsequent

hearing also taking place after the impugned decision which is enough; the instances where

the person aggrieved by the decision could not have adduced any evidence even if an inquiry

was held; the instances where the case is in the nature of open and shut case etc.

In Gamini Dissanayake's case, Fernando J having considered the above aspects, had

proceeded to hold in respect of some of the petitioners in that case, that a hearing would not

have been a useless hearing as those petitioners could have tendered an explanation to the

issues raised. Having held as above, Fernando J then proceeded to consider the merits of the

cases in respect of the other petitioners in that case and indeed held that the expulsion of the

other petitioners in Gamini Dissanayake's case, (petitioners in SC Special No.s 05 and 08/

1991) was valid for the reasons he had set out in his judgment. In doing so, Fernando J went

on to say, in his judgment the following:

Had these proceedings been purely by way of judicial review, it may well be that

we would have to shut our eyes to the merits of the decision, and look only at

the defects in the decision-making process. But it is accepted that our jurisdiction

is not restricted. The burden, if any, must be on the Respondents, for it is the

denial of natural justice by them which has resulted in these proceedings. I have

21 At page 186.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 26 of 62

therefore to consider whether, on the merits the respondents have shown that

the decision was a good one, thereby disentitling the petitioners to relief.22

The basis for Fernando J to hold that the expulsion of some of those petitioners to be valid in

Gamini Dissanayake's case was because those petitioners had not tendered any explanation

either in their affidavits or in the documents.

Thus, it could be seen that even Fernando J in his minority judgment, despite the breach of

the Rules of Natural Justice by the respondents in that case, had proceeded to hold that the

expulsion of some of those petitioners was valid. This goes on to show that our courts have

recognized the availability of such a course of action in the course of the proceedings in this

court, where a petitioner has invoked this Courts jurisdiction under Article 99 (1) (3) of the

Constitution. This is because the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in this instance is not mere

exercise of Judicial Review of the decision of the relevant party which has expelled the relevant

member.

The set of cases I would cite next, would show that this Court has indeed consistently applied

the above test in all the other cases as well, before it had decided to grant relief to the

petitioners of those respective cases.

The petitioner in Rambukwella Vs. UNP and others,23 being a Member of Parliament has filed

that petition in terms of Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution, for a determination that his

expulsion from the United National Party (UNP), is invalid. In that case also this court had

held, that the expulsion of the petitioner in that case by the UNP was invalid. That was because

the reasons such as: the cogent material pointing to the absence of jurisdiction of the body

which had taken relevant disciplinary action against the petitioners; the denial of legal

representation to the petitioner, which would have enabled the petitioner to show to the

satisfaction of the body and to establish the absence of jurisdiction; the defects in the

resolution of the national executive committee in that the said resolution had not been

seconded by any person, or put to vote before national executive committee, i.e., because

the resolution was ex facie defective since no person seconding it nor the matter being

discussed or put to vote before the national executive committee; the fact that the petitioners

conduct could not have possibly come within the ambit of Article 3.4(d) of the constitution of

the United National Party under which the petitioner in that case was charged etc. were

present in that case. Sarath N Silva CJ in that case, held as follows:

Although membership of the Party has a concomitant liability to disciplinary action

in terms of the Constitution of the Party as correctly submitted by Counsel for the

22 Emphasis is mine. 23 2007 (2) SLR 329.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 27 of 62

respondents, in deciding on the validity of an expulsion, which has the further

implication of the loss of the seat in Parliament, the overall conduct of the person

subject to such action has to be taken into account.24

In Sarath Amunugamas case, the United National Party expelled five petitioners (five

connected applications) from the membership of the party on a decision of the working

committee of the party. The immediate ground of expulsion was that the petitioners had met

then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, and assured her of winning the

Presidential Election 1999, when in fact the United National Party had nominated its leader

Ranil Wickremesinghe as a candidate at that election. Two more allegations made especially

against petitioner Sarath Amunugama, were,

1. Pronouncing to National media about formation of a national government without a

mandate form the party and

2. The fact that he had told the BBC that he would leave the United National Party if the

party failed to respond to his national government concept.

In that case, no explanations were called for from the petitioners; no charge sheets were

served on petitioners; no inquiry was held against the petitioners, before the decision to expel

them from the membership of the party. Acting Chief Justice Amerasinghe, in that case, stated

that he was unable to accept the submissions of the learned counsel for respondents that a

hearing would have been useless for several reasons. Some of those reasons were, that the

matter could not have been described as an open and shut case. Another reason Acting

Chief Justice Amerasinghe had given was that a hearing would not have been a useless

formality for the working committee had a choice of sanction.

Even in Sarath Amunugamas case, Acting Chief Justice Amerasinghe had cited the proposition

of kulatunga J in Gamini Dissanayake's case which had recognized that in the presence of

overwhelming reasons, the court, as it is exercising a sui generis jurisdiction under Article 99

(13) (a) of the constitution, can do what the court did in Gamini Dissanayakes case. It is apt

to reproduce the relevant paragraph of Acting Chief Justices judgment from Sarath

Amunugamas case.

Kulatunga, J. (with whom Wadugodapitiya, J. agreed) stated at p. 242 that "since

the petitioners had not been prepared to submit themselves to the party councils,

then, there is no force in their complaint that the Working Committee had failed to

give them a hearing. I hold that the Working Committee acted fairly and reasonably

in taking disciplinary proceedings against the petitioners in the way it did.

24 At page 334; emphasis is mine.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 28 of 62

Kulatunga, J. went into the merits of the case and concluded at p. 246 that "the

remedy of expulsion befits the mischief unleashed by the petitioners".

However, Kulatunga, J. seems to suggest that it is not in every case that the Court

should go into the merits. .25

Similarly, Acting Chief Justice Amerasinghe, in Sarath Amunugamas case had also cited

Dheeraratne Js judgment in Tilak Karunaratnes case. The relevant paragraph from Acting

Chief Justices judgment is reproduced below,

In Tilak Karunanaratne v. Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike and others, the petitioner,

a Member of Parliament, was expelled from his party on a decision of the Executive

Committee of the party to which he refused to submit. He challenged his expulsion

in terms of Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution. Dheeraratne, J. at p. 115 stated

that, in view of the conclusion His Lordship had reached, namely that "the

petitioner's impugned statements are justified" in that he was exercising his

Constitutional rights of freedom of speech and association, it was "unnecessary"

to deal with certain questions, including a "failure to observe principles of natural

justice in the decision making process." Dheeraratne, J. (Wijetunga, J. agreeing)

held that the expulsion of the petitioner was invalid. Dheeraratne J. said at pp.

101-102 that Article 99(13)(a) conferred an original jurisdiction on the Court

empowering it to go into the merits and shield Members of Parliament from being

"unlawfully and/or capriciously" expelled from their parties. His Lordship did not

accept the submission of learned counsel, Mr. H.L. de Silva, P.C., that

investigations by the Court should be restricted to the question whether proper

procedures had been followed,26 lest judges might find themselves wandering into

the "political thicket", and cited with approval the observations of Fernando, J.

quoted above in Dissanayake on that question.27

In Ramamoorthy and Rameshwaran Vs. Douglas Devananda and others,28 , G. P. S. de Silva

CJ had quoted with approval, the observations of Kulatunga J in Gamini Dissanaykes case

(quoted above), and proceeded to hold that no weighty considerations like in Gamini

Dissanaykes case were present in Ramamoorthys case.

In Ameer Alis case, three petitioners who had been expelled from the SLMC, had contended

that they had serious differences of views in regard to the manner in which the members

25 At page 199. 26 Emphasis is mine. 27 At page 200. 28 1998 (2) Sri. L. R. 278.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 29 of 62

elected from the SLMC should conduct themselves, in Parliament as well as with the Leader

of the party. They had refused to sign a pledge in the specimen form declaring loyalty and

total allegiance to the party, to its Leader and to the High Command. They had written a joint

letter informing the Leader of the party that they would extend their fullest support to the

Government in its endeavor to find a lasting solution to the problems identified by them, which

will benefit the Muslims in particular and the country at large in general. Shortly thereafter

the three petitioners in that case were appointed as project ministers, they received letters

from the party requiring them to show cause as to why disciplinary action should not be taken

against them. The petitioners responded by letter requesting time to answer and were granted

an additional 10 days and were required to be present at the meeting of the High Command,

scheduled for 09-12-2004. The petitioners replied to charges by letter dated 07-12-2004

denying allegations and setting out most of the facts and circumstance included in the letter

previously addressed to the Leader. By letter dated 20-12-2004, the Secretary General,

disputed the contents of the reply and informed the Petitioners that they could present their

case to the High Command and requested that a date be nominated in the month of January,

on which date the matter would be heard at one of the Hotels that were specified. It appears

that no further action was taken in the matter until March 2005, when letters dated 01-03-

2005, was received by the Petitioners, signed by the Secretary General who informed them

that the Polit bureau will go in to the show cause notice at a meeting on 12-03-2005 to be

held at the Earls Court, Trans Asia Hotel at 5.00 p.m. The Petitioners were requested to be

present. Another letter was received by the Petitioners bearing the same date sent by the

Secretary General requesting the Petitioners to be present on Sunday 13th March at 5.00 p.

m. at the same venue for a meeting of the High Command and at which meeting the High

Command will go into the show cause notice that had been issued. The Petitioners replied by

letters dated 11-03-2005, referring to the two sets of inquiries to be held by two bodies of the

party and stated that they were puzzled as to how they have been summoned to face two

disciplinary inquiries on two successive dates in respect of allegations set out in one show

cause notice. The Petitioners sought specific clarification as to which particular body would

seek to exercise disciplinary control. It was in such a background that the petitioners in that

case had been notified of their expulsion from the party by letter dated 04-04-2005.

Indeed, it is noteworthy that in Ameer Alis case the High Command of SLMC, after this Court

had issued notices on the Respondents in that case, having taken into consideration the

statements in the affidavits filed in Court and having taken into consideration the positions

taken up by the petitioners that they were not afforded a hearing prior to adopting the extreme

measure of expulsion, had decided to withdraw the expulsions communicated by letter dated

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 30 of 62

04-04-2005 in order to give them a further opportunity to present their position before the

Party. Thus, in Ameer Alis case, the relevant party (the SLMC) itself had conceded that it

should have afforded the petitioners in that case, an opportunity to present their positions

before the Party.

Even in Ameer Alis case, the five-judge bench of this Court had cited the proposition of

kulatunga J in Gamini Dissanayake's case that if the complaint is that the petitioner has been

expelled from the membership of his party in breach of the rules of natural justice, he will

ordinarily be entitled to relief and this Court may not determine such expulsion to be valid

unless there are overwhelming reasons warranting such decision when it decided the

following:

To say the least, the Leader has thrown the principles of natural justice and

fairness to the winds. The hostile comments made well before the commencement

of any disciplinary action by itself establish the allegations of the Petitioners of

malafides and of bias. To make matters worse, the Leader has precipitously stated

that the Party will take action against the Petitioners in due course. Thereby he

has assumed the authority to decide on the matter for the entire Party. This is far

removed from the democratic process, which should characterize the action of a

political party and the degree of fairness, being a sine qua non of any disciplinary

action that may be validly taken by a political party in respect of any of its

members.

In this background the Court has to examine the impugned disciplinary process

with a greater degree of caution to ascertain whether the initial stigma of bias and

mala fides have been removed in the course of the disciplinary action allegedly

taken.29

With regard to Ameer Alis case, it would suffice for me to state here that such were the facts

of Ameer Alis case. Thus, the foregoing judicial precedence show in short that any breach of

the Rules of Natural Justice alone cannot finally decide the validity of the expulsion of a

petitioner in a petition filed under Article 99 (13) (a) of the constitution.

HAS THE ABSENCE OF A FORMAL INQUIRY VITIATED THE EXPULSION?

Let me now turn to the question whether the absence of a formal inquiry has vitiated the

decision of the SLMC to expel the Petitioner in the instant case. In doing so, let me first refer

to the approach the following three English cases had taken on the above question. These

29 At page 197.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 31 of 62

would be relevant in that regard as Kulatunga J in Gamini Dissanayake's case, has adopted

those principles.

Let me first refer to the case of Gaiman Vs. National Association for Mental Health,30

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as Gaimans case). The National Association for Mental

health a highly reputable charitable body concerned with, inter alia, the preservation and

development of mental health and the prevention and treatment of mental disorders. The

Association had a council of management comprising the chairman, vice-chairman and

honorary treasurer together with a number of ordinary members elected by the association.

The Articles of Association provided, inter alia, that a member of the Association shall forthwith

cease to be a member if such member has been requested by resolution of the Council to

resign. It has further provided that a member so requested to resign may within seven days

after such notice of resolution has been given, appeal against such resolution to the

Association in a General Meeting and in the event of such appeal being successful, the

resolution requesting the member to resign shall be void ab initio.

Let me now briefly state facts of Gaimans case. For five years there had been a state of

hostility between the Association and members of the Church of Scientology and articles in

a periodical published by the association had resulted in two actions by Scientologists against

the Association for libel. The Scientologists had attacked the Association in various

publications. In 1969, the rate of applications for membership of the Association had

increased. Notice was given of the annual general meeting of the Association to be held on

12th November. The nominations included the nominations of the plaintiffs as chairman and

ordinary members of the council. All nominees, proposers and seconders appeared to be

Scientologists. On 10th November, the council, acting under the above provisions in its Articles

of Association, expelled 302 members of the Association. Those expelled members sought a

mandatory injunction from Courts, praying for an order on the Association to afford to the

plaintiffs, until trial of the action, all rights of their membership.

Megarry J in Gaimans case, refusing to grant the prayed mandatory injunction, held in his

judgment inter alia, the following points:

i. There were no grounds for the court to intervene to prevent an alleged abuse of power

by the council since the power to deprive a member of his membership was a direct

power and the evidence did not disclose that it had been exercised otherwise than in

good faith and in what were believed to be the best interests of the association and

members as a whole.

30 [1970] 2 All ER 362, 374, 376, 381.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 32 of 62

ii. The principles of natural justice did not apply to the expulsion of members, so as to

afford them a right to be heard before expulsion, because there were circumstances

sufficient to prevent the application of the principles, in that the council owed the

association a duty to exercise their powers bona fide in the interests of the association;

this duty might require a power to be exercised at great speed (whereas natural justice

might require delay); this in itself indicated that the council was intended to be able

to exercise its powers unfettered by the principles of natural justice.

Megarry J in his judgment proceeded further to hold that the council had acted in the bona

fide belief that it was in the best interests of the Association and that the council had exercised

its power of deprivation of membership in good faith for the purpose for which it was conferred

on it by the Articles of Association. Megarry J proceeded further to hold as follows:

It is beyond question that Scientologists have for long been attacking the

association in a variety of ways. The attacks have been virulent, and like the

sentiments, the language, I think, speaks for itself. I need say no more about it

than that much of it cannot be described as moderate and reasoned argument

designed to convert those who hold what are conceived to be erroneous views.31

In Gamini Dissanayake's case, it was common ground that the petitioners have been expelled

from the party without informing them of the charge or giving them an opportunity of being

heard. Kulatunga J in its majority judgment having considered the question whether such a

procedure could be justified, referred to and adopted the principle used by Megarry J, in

Gaimans case. Kulatunga J then proceeded to apply the same to the facts and circumstances

in Gamini Dissanayakes case. The following paragraph quoted from Kulatunga Js judgment

in Gamini Dissanayakes case would bear testimony to that.

As Megarry J. observed in Gaiman's case I am myself not concerned with " the

merits of the views " held by the UNP and the petitioners, (described in the Press

as "rebels"). I am concerned with the right of the Working Committee to have

proceeded against the petitioners without a hearing. As in Gaiman's case here

too the attacks have been " virulent " and " much of it cannot be described as

being moderate and reasoned argument designed to convert those who hold

what are conceived to be erroneous views." Mr. Choksy submitted that in

Gaiman's case the Scientologists had been making representations for several

years; here they launched a campaign without any prior discussion within the

party. I would add that in Gaiman's case there was no threat to stable

31 At page 373 & 374.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 33 of 62

government in the country; nor was there any campaign which was likely to

confuse or inflame the public mind against the Head of a State, the government

and the party in power. The interests involved in that case were those of the

Mental Health Association whereas this case involves the interests of a party

which has been voted into power by the electors and above all the interests of

the public who are often the victims of such indisciplined controversy.

Having stated the above, Kulatunga J in Gamini Dissanayakes case proceeded to hold as

follows:

The point I make is that if the petitioners themselves were not prepared to

submit to the party councils, then, there is no force in their complaint that the

Working Committee had failed to give them a hearing. I hold that the Working

Committee acted fairly and reasonably in taking disciplinary proceedings against

the petitioners in the way it did.32

The second English case I would refer to, is the case of Glynn Vs. Keele University and

another,33hereinafter sometimes referred to as Keele Universitys case. In that case, certain

students had appeared naked in the area of the Students' Union on 19th June 1970 causing

offence to many members and employees of the University, and residents on the campus.

The offenders included the Plaintiff in that case and certain students due to graduate on the

1st July. The term ended on the 30th June and the Graduation Ceremony was on the 1st July.

If a Disciplinary Panel had been convened it could not have met until after the end of term,

by which time the graduation students would no longer have been within the disciplinary

jurisdiction of the University. Thus, the vice-chancellor referring to the incident of 19th June

and to his responsibility for maintaining good order, wrote to the plaintiff by letter dated 1st

July, to the following effect:

`.. I shall report to the Council at its meeting on the 7th July that you have been fined

10 pounds and excluded from residence in any residential accommodation on the

University campus from today's date for the whole of the session of 1970/71 . . . If

you wish to address any grievance in connection with the above to the Council . . .

you should send it in writing to the Registrar to reach him not later than Tuesday, 7th

July.'

The plaintiff replied to the Registrar by letter dated 3rd July stating that he wished to appeal;

but having gone abroad for the long vacation, and having left no forwarding address he did

32 At page 242. 33 [1971] 1 W L R 487, [1971] 2 All E R 89.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 34 of 62

not receive a letter giving him notice that the appeal was to be heard on 2nd September. As

the plaintiff did not appear at the hearing of the appeal the vice-chancellor's decision stood.

The plaintiff, sought from Courts, inter alia, an injunction against the University of Keele and

the vice-chancellor of the university, restraining them from excluding him from residence on

the campus of the university for the remainder of the academic year 1970/71.

It must be stressed here that in Keele University's case, the Plaintiff had not made any formal

admission that he was one of the undergraduates concerned in the offence; there was

nowhere in his affidavits, or in the submissions of the counsel for him, any real suggestion

that he was not one of the naked undergraduates on that occasion.

Pennycuick V-C in Keele University's case, having concluded the followings: the Vice

Chancellor was under a duty to comply with the requirements of natural justice; the Vice

Chancellor had not complied with the rules of natural justice; nevertheless, proceeded to

decide as follows.

I have, again after considerable hesitation, reached the conclusion that in this case

I ought to exercise my discretion by not granting an injunction. I recognize that

this particular discretion should be very sparingly exercised in that sense where

there has been some failure in natural justice. On the other hand, it certainly should

be exercised in that sense in an appropriate case, and I think this is such a case.

There is no question of fact involved as I have already said. I must plainly proceed

on the footing that the plaintiff was one of the individuals concerned. There is no

doubt that the offence was one of a kind which merited a severe penalty according

to any standards current even today. I have no doubt that the sentence of

exclusion of residence in the campus was a proper penalty in respect of that

offence. Nor has the plaintiff in his evidence put forward any specific justification

for what he did. So the position would have been that if the vice-chancellor had

accorded him a hearing before making his decision, all that he, or any one on his

behalf could have done would have been to put forward some general plea by way

of mitigation. I do not disregard the importance of such a plea in an appropriate

case, but I do not think the mere fact that he was deprived of throwing himself on

the mercy of the vice-chancellor in that particular way is sufficient to justify setting

aside a decision which was intrinsically a perfectly proper one.

In all the circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff has

suffered no injustice, and that I ought not to accede to the present motion.34

Kulatunga J in Gamini Dissanayakes case, relied on Keele University's case, to illustrate how

the Court's approach is affected by the subject matter.

The third English case I would refer to, is the case of Cinnamond and others Vs. British Airports

Authority,35 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Cinnamonds case. In that case, six

minicab drivers (the appellants in that case), had been prosecuted on numerous occasions by

the British Airports Authority for loitering at an airport owned and operated by the Authority

and touting there for passengers. They persistently refused to pay the fines and continued to

loiter and tour for fares. Acting under a byelaw which empowered the Authority to prohibit

any person from entering the airport except as a bona fide airline passenger, the Authority by

notice prohibited the appellants from entering the airport until further notice. The Authority

had not given any opportunity for the appellants to make any representations to the Authority

before the ban was imposed. Thus, one of the grounds upon which the appellants sought a

declaration from Courts that those notices were invalid was that there had been a breach of

the Rules of Natural Justice.

Lord Denning, Shaw LJ and Brandon LJ though unanimous in their final conclusion in

Cinnamonds case had considered the question whether there had been a breach of the rules

of natural justice because the appellants had not been given an opportunity of making

representations to the Authority before the ban was imposed and proceeded to comment on

this aspect of the case in their separate judgments. Lord Denning in his judgment in

Cinnamonds case held as follows:

Counsel for the plaintiffs urged us to say that this was such a case; that there

ought to have been an opportunity given to these six car-hire drivers, so that they

could be heard. They might give reasons on which the prohibition order might be

modified; or they might be given a little time; or they might be ready to give an

undertaking which might be acceptable: to behave properly in future. When it was

said that a fair hearing would make no difference, counsel cited an important

passage from Professor Wades Administrative Law (4th Edn, 1977, P 455):

... in the case of a discretionary administrative decision, such as the dismissal

of a teacher or the expulsion of a student, hearing his case will often soften

the heart of the authority and alter their decision, even though it is clear from

the outset that punitive action would be justified.'

35 [1980] 2 All ER 368.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 36 of 62

I can see the force of that argument. But it only applies when there is a legitimate

expectation of being heard. In cases where there is no legitimate expectation, there

is no call for a hearing. We have given some illustrations in earlier cases. I ventured

to give two in R v Gaming Board for Great Britain, ex parte Benaim [1970] 2 All ER

528 at 533, [1970] 2 QB 417 at 430. I instanced the Board of Trade when they

granted industrial development certificates, or the television authorities when it

awarded television programme contracts. In administrative decisions of that kind,

a hearing does not have to be given to those who may be disappointed. Only

recently in Norwest Holst Ltd v Department of Trade [1978] 3 All ER 280 at 292,

[1978] Ch 201 at 224 I gave the instance of a police officer who is suspended for

misconduct. Pending investigations, he is suspended on full pay. He is not given

any notice of the charge at that stage, nor any opportunity of being heard. Likewise,

the Stock Exchange may suspend dealings in a broker's shares. In none of these

cases is it necessary to have a hearing.

Applying those principles, suppose that these car-hire drivers were of good

character and had for years been coming into the airport under an implied license

to do so. If in that case there was suddenly a prohibition order preventing them

from entering, then it would seem only fair that they should be given a hearing and

a chance to put their case. But that is not this case. These men have a long record

of convictions. They have large fines outstanding. They are continuing to engage in

conduct which they must know is unlawful and contrary to the byelaws. When they

were summonsed for past offences, they put their case, no doubt, to the

magistrates and to the Crown Court. Now when the patience of the authority is

exhausted, it seems to me that the authority can properly suspend them until

further notice, just like the police officer I mentioned. In the circumstances they

had no legitimate expectation of being heard. It is not a necessary preliminary that

they should have a hearing or be given a further chance to explain. Remembering

always this: that it must have been apparent to them why the prohibition was

ordered, and equally apparent that, if they had a change of heart and were ready

to comply with the rules, no doubt the prohibition would be withdrawn. They could

have made representations immediately, if they wished, in answer to the prohibition

order. That they did not do.

The simple duty of the airport authority was to act fairly and reasonably. It seems

to me that it has acted fairly and reasonably. I find nothing wrong in the course

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 37 of 62

which it has taken. I find myself in substantial agreement with the judge, and I

would dismiss the appeal.

Shaw LJ in his judgment in Cinnamonds case, while agreeing with Lord Denning, referring to

the failure to give the six minicab drivers an opportunity of making representations to the

Authority, stated as follows:

As to the suggestion of unfairness in that the plaintiffs were not given an

opportunity of making representations, it is clear on the history of this matter that

the plaintiffs put themselves so far outside the limits of tolerable conduct as to

disentitle themselves to expect that any further representations on their part could

have any influence or relevance. The long history of contraventions, of flouting the

regulations and of totally disregarding the penalties demonstrate that in this

particular case there was no effective deterrent. The only way of dealing with the

situation was by excluding them altogether.

It does not follow that the attitude of the authority may not change in the future

if it can be persuaded by representations on behalf of the plaintiffs that they are

minded in future to comply with those regulations.

The learned judge came to the right conclusion, and I too would dismiss the

appeal.36

Brandon LJ in his judgment in Cinnamonds case while agreeing with Lord Denning, held as

follows:

The third question which was argued before us was that of natural justice. So far

as that is concerned, I agree with what has been said by Lord Denning MR and

Shaw LJ. I do not think that in the circumstances of this case there was any need

to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to make representations to the authority before

they issued the ban. The reason for the ban must have been well known when the

letters were received. Any representations which were desired to be made could

have been made immediately by letter. None were. The truth is that no

representations other than representations which included satisfactory

undertakings about future behaviour would have been of the slightest use.

If I am wrong in thinking that some opportunity should have been given, then it

seems to me that no prejudice was suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of not

being given that opportunity. It is quite evident that they were not prepared then,

36 At page 375 & 376.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 38 of 62

and are not even prepared now, to give any satisfactory undertakings about their

future conduct. Only if they were would representations be of any use.37

In Gamini Dissanayake's case, Kulatunga J in the majority judgment when considering the

question whether such a procedure could be justified had referred to and adopted with

approval, the approach Lord Denning had taken in Cinnamonds case.38That was to justify the

common ground that the petitioners in Gamini Dissanayake's case, had been expelled from

the party without informing them of the charge or giving them an opportunity of being heard.

In Jayatillake and another Vs. Kaleel and others,39 (hereinafter referred to as Jayatillakes

case), two petitioners who are Members of Parliament filed petition in this Court invoking its

jurisdiction under Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution challenging their expulsion from the

United National Party (UNP). In that case, the Disciplinary Committee of the Party's Working

Committee recommended on 3-12-1991 to take disciplinary action against the Petitioners on

account of several matters. The Working Committee met at 7.00 p.m. on the same day and,

having considered the Report of the Disciplinary Committee and the letters dated 9-10-1991

written by the Petitioners, decided that the General Secretary should write to these two

members, requesting them to be present at a meeting of the Working Committee to be held

on 06-12-1991 at 8.00 p.m. for the purpose of discussing their conduct as members of the

Party". No particulars were given to the petitioners. Admittedly, the petitioners had not

received those letters on or before 06-12-1991. Assuming that the Petitioners had received

notice, the Working Committee duly met on 06-12-1991, considered the relevant material and

then resolved to expel the petitioners in that case from the Party, with immediate effect, for

the reasons given in the letters dated 09-12-1991 and communicated to the petitioners of

their expulsion. The petitioners before they received the letters from the party communicating

their expulsion, had sent letters dated 09-12-1991 to the UNP to inform that they were not in

receipt of letters informing them that the meeting of the Working Committee was to be held

on 06-12-1991 at 8.00 p.m. However, neither Petitioner had requested another opportunity

of appearing before the Working Committee. Nevertheless, the UNP had sent letters to the

petitioners asking the petitioners to submit written observations stating their position with

regard to the charges before 27-12-1991. The petitioners had received those letters on 23-

12-1991 and they had replied. The Working Committee met on 30-12-1991; they considered

the Petitioners' replies dated 26-12-1991. The Working Committee decided that the Petitioners

had not adduced any facts or reasons to justify further inquiry and accordingly, decided not

37 At page 376 & 377. 38 At page 236. 39 1994 (1) Sri. L.R. 319.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 39 of 62

to reconsider or alter the decisions reached on 06-12-1991 which was then communicated to

the petitioners the same day.

Although there are two judgments in Jayatillakes case, one by Fernando J and the other by

Kulatunga J with which Wadugodapitiya J had agreed. Both judgments had considered the

question whether there had been a breach of the Rules of Natural Justice in view of the fact

that there was no formal hearing before making the decision to expel the petitioners in that

case from the party. Both judgments had concluded that in the above circumstances, the UNP

had sufficiently complied with the Rules of Natural Justice and therefore the expulsion was

valid and proceeded to comment on this aspect in those separate judgments to which I would

now turn.

Fernando J in Jayatillakes case, holding that in the context of all that happened in December

1991, the four days allowed to the petitioners (of which they needed only three) were

sufficient to state their case and the manner in which they did so, had a direct bearing on the

further question whether Natural Justice required an oral hearing and additional evidence to

be placed in that case, proceeded to hold as follows:

Those were cases of re-hearing by the same authority. The principle that a failure

of Natural Justice at the original hearing may sometimes be cured by a "full re-

hearing" by another body was recognised by the Privy council in Pillai v. Singapore

City Council. Having held that the rules of Natural Justice did not apply to the first

tribunal, yet the Privy Council observed that even if they did apply, the subsequent

proceedings cured the defect. Although they were by way of appeal, those

proceedings were in the nature of a re-hearing and evidence was called de nova.

This was followed in Stringer v. Minister of Housing. In Calvin v Carr, the Privy

Council dealing with an appeal from New South Wales, recognised that there was

no absolute rule, either way, as to whether defects in Natural Justice at an original

hearing can be cured through proceedings by way of appeal or re-hearing (at pp.

447-448); everything depends on whether after examination of the hearing

process, original and appeal as a whole", the Court is satisfied that "there has been

a fair result, reached by fair methods"; whether the appellant's case has received,

overall, full and fair consideration", (pp. 448, 449, 452).

Applying these principles, (a) the initial breach of Natural Justice was not deliberate;

(b) action was not taken to enforce, or to make legal consequences flow from, the

order of expulsion, and the fact that the Petitioners participated in the subsequent

proceedings gave the Working Committee a locus poenitentiae; (c) the allegations

were fairly and adequately, though not fully and precisely, communicated; and (d)

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 40 of 62

a fair opportunity was given to the Petitioners to state their case, and an oral

hearing became unnecessary as the facts were " undisputed in consequence of their

replies. I hold that the Petitioners, case had received - overall - full and fair

consideration, and that there had been a fair result, reached by fair methods.40

Kulatunga J (Wadugodapitiya J agreeing) in Jayatillakes case, in his judgment rejecting the

allegation that the expulsion of the petitioners was invalid for contravention of Rules of Natural

Justice proceeded to hold as follows:

I am of the view that the Working Committee had done everything possible to hold

a full and fair hearing on the second occasion. The petitioners, however had

defected from the Party and were irreconcilable. They were not interested in

answering the allegations adequately and relied on mere jurisdictional grounds and

bald denials. The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioners told us that the

petitioners were not bound to disclose their material or to disclose the reasons for

their failure to attend Parliament on 10.10.91. If so, the petitioners are themselves

to blame for their predicament. I have taken this view in the light of the following

considerations:-

a) The rights of the petitioners to Party membership are contractual. At the time of

their expulsion, they had repudiated the UNP and were de facto members of the

DUNF; and their expulsion constituted nothing more than the severance of the

formal link between them and the Party. It follows that if they wished to remain in

the Party they should have taken the initiative and cooperated with the Party by

making a full and frank disclosure of their defence. If they failed to do so, they must

take the consequences.

b) In handling a crisis of the magnitude faced by the respondents and in dealing with

men of the petitioners' calibre, a political party must be allowed a discretion to

decide what sanctions are appropriate for violations of Party discipline; and if the

Party decides, bona fide, to expel any member guilty of repudiating the Party, as

the petitioners have done, this Court will not in the exercise of its constitutional

jurisdiction impose such member on the Party. If that is done, Parliamentary

Government based on the Political Party System will become unworkable.

I am satisfied that the disciplinary proceedings against the petitioners were, in all the

circumstances, fair.41

40 At page 357. 41 At page 399.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 41 of 62

Mr. Sumanthiran PC, appearing for the 1st, 2nd and 8th Respondents (i.e., the SLMC, its Leader,

its Secretary respectively) conceded that the SLMC had not held a formal inquiry against the

Petitioner before issuing P15. However, it was his submission that the Petitioner has failed

first to show cause that he has a prima facie tenable explanation, which he is bound to tender

in the first place, as response to P9.

Finally, Mr. Sumanthiran, PC, also submitted that the antecedent hearing that the Supreme

Court has given to the Petitioner on the totality of the case would satisfy the compliance of

Rules of Natural Justice (Principle of Audi Alteram Partem) as far as the validity of the

Petitioners expulsion from the party is concerned. It was therefore his submission that even

on that ground the absence of a formal inquiry the instant case would not vitiate the decision

of the SLMC to expel the Petitioner.

Let me now consider whether the absence of a formal inquiry has vitiated the decision of the

SLMC to expel the Petitioner in the instant case. In order to consider this aspect of the case,

let me first outline the sequence of events which had led to the High Command of the SLMC

to unanimously resolve to expel the Petitioner from party membership with immediate effect.

The SLMC has called for a written explanation from the Petitioner by the letter dated 27-11-

2021 (produced marked P9) signed by the Respondent who is the Secretary of the SLMC.

This letter is as follows,

As you are aware, the Party called for a high command meeting on 21.11.2021 at the

Party headquarters "Dharussalam', to discuss and decide on the Party stand vis-a-vis

the 2022 Budget (The Appropriation Bill).

You are also aware that at this meeting, it was decided unanimously, that Members of

Parliament being members of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, shall not vote in favour

of the budget at it's second reading vote on 22.11.2021 and shall not vote in favour

at the third reading vote as well.

You, however, on 22.11.2021 voted in favour of the said Budget at its second reading,

in blatant violation of the said decision of the High Command.

In doing so, you have acted in breach of the party decision while holding a senior and

substantial position in the party high command namely, Deputy Leader.

In the circumstances, the party leader, exercising his powers under the party

constitution, has decided to suspend you from the High Command position held by

you and to call for explanation on the said breach of the party decision.

Therefore, as instructed by the Leader, I do hereby call for your explanation of your

decision to vote in favour of the 2022 Budget in violation of the party decision.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 42 of 62

Your explanation in writing in the form of an affidavit should reach me within fourteen

days from the date of the receipt of this letter.

Failure to do so will compel the party to arrive at the conclusion that you have no

cause to show against the said violation of the party decision by you.

Replying to P9 the Petitioner by letter dated 10-12-2021 (produced marked P10), had

communicated to the SLMC stating the followings:

i. He could not attend the meeting of the High Command scheduled for 21-11-2021 at

party headquarters, as it had been summoned at very short notice and hence, he was

not able to attend the meeting due to reasons beyond his control which he had duly

notified to the secretary of the SLMC.

ii. He did not receive any communication as to whether the meeting was held or

postponed or any decision taken at the meeting.

iii. He requires a period of one month to furnish his response to the show cause letter

dated 27-11-2021, which he had received.

iv. He requests to let him know the relevant provisions in the party constitution under

which the leader is said to have exercised his powers to suspend him from the High

Command position.

v. He also requests a copy of the party constitution.

The secretary of the SLMC by letter dated 22-12-2021 produced marked P11, has clearly

allowed the further period of one month requested by the Petitioner to tender his response to

the show cause letter. The Petitioner himself in his petition has admitted that he had received

P11 as a response to his letter dated 10-12-2021 (P10), from the secretary of the SLMC

which had granted him a further period of one month to tender his response.42 That is also

the position of the SLMC and hence it is common ground that the SLMC has clearly allowed

the further one-month period requested by the Petitioner to tender his response to P9, the

show cause letter.

Then the Petitioner has written the letter dated 04-01-2022 produced marked P12, thanking

the SLMC for granting the further one-month period requested by him to tender his response

to P9 while also repeating the same request again, namely, the request for a copy of the

latest party constitution and the sections under which the Secretary of the SLMC had called

for his explanation. P12 is a short three-line letter which is as follows:

42 Paragraph 46 of the petition dated 20th May 2022.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 43 of 62

Thank you for your letter dated 22-12-2021 allowing a months time for my

response. Please send me a copy of the latest party Constitution & the sections

under which you have called for my response at your earliest convenience.

The Secretary of the SLMC by letter dated 14-03-2022 (produced marked P13), had once

again informed the Petitioner to submit his explanation by 15-04-2022. The Petitioner has

admitted that he was in receipt of P13 which had extended the time to submit his explanation

until 15-04-2022. Indeed, P13 is a document produced by the Petitioner himself. Reading of

both P12 and P13 together would show that the SLMC had extended time until 15-04-2022

by P13 even without any request made in that regard by the Petitioner in P12. Indeed, the

Petitioner in P12 had continued to maintain his silence on tendering his explanation.

Replying to P13, the Petitioner by the letter dated 07-04-2022 (produced marked P14), has

repeated his request for a copy of the party constitution. It is worthwhile producing this letter

P14 as it is. It is as follows,

I am in receipt of your letter dated 14.03.2022

In my response letter to you dated 10.12.2021, I had explained as follows:

You also refer to a meeting of the High Command scheduled for 21.11.2021 at the

party headquarters, which I could not attend. You are aware, the said High Command

meeting had been summoned at very short notice and I was not able to attend the

said meeting due to reasons beyond my control which I had duly notified to you. I did

not receive any communication whether the meeting was held or postponed or of any

decision taken at the meeting."

" Meanwhile please let me know the relevant provisions in the party Constitution under

which the Leader is said to have exercised his powers to suspend me from the High

Command position together with a copy of the relevant Constitution."

You will note that you have not made available the relevant information and a copy of

the relevant Constitution as yet. I shall therefore request you to furnish me with the

relevant Information and a copy of the relevant Constitution which are undoubtedly

available to you, at your earliest convenience, to enable me to furnish a more detailed

response further to your request.

With the receipt of the letter P14 from the Petitioner, the SLMC by letter dated 23-04-2022

(produced marked P15), had communicated to the Petitioner the following,

Disciplinary Action - Expulsion from the Party (Sri Lanka Muslim Congress)

Membership.

I received your letter dated 7th April 2022.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 44 of 62

Your letter was placed before the High command of the party which met on

22.04.2022.

The High Command noted that you have not given any reason for violating the party

decision taken at the High Command meeting held on 21.11.2021, except to plead

your purported ignorance of the said decision.

High command noted that the said decision was not only conveyed to you by the leader

but also it was given a huge publicity through the media.

The High Command also noted that;

1. you are well aware the said meeting on 2.11.2021 was summoned for the

specific purpose of taking a decision as to the party's stance on the

government's proposed Appropriation Bill for the year 2021/2022, as it was

spelled out in the invitation SMS sent by the secretary.

2. You are also aware that the secretary has not sent any message, cancelling or

postponing the meeting. On the contrary you have sent SMS to the secretary,

excusing your attendance, which you have admitted in your letter,

Hence, the High Command proceeded to consider the action to be taken against you

on the basis that you have no cause to show.

After due considerations of all these relevant matters the High Command has

unanimously resolved to expel you from party membership with immediate effect.

Accordingly, on the instructions of the party I do hereby communicate that your party

membership from Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is duly terminated and as a result you

have ceased to be a member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress the political party from

which you were elected to the present Parliament.

Let me digress a bit from the sequence of events at this stage to again refer to Gamini

Dissanayakes case. In that case, Kulatunga J having considered many authorities cited before

him, stated as follows:

I appreciate that it is not possible to come to a finding on the contentions

advanced before us on a piece-meal approach with reference to this authority or

the other. In my view our decision rests on an application of more than one

principle, cumulatively, to the facts and circumstances of this case bearing also in

mind the legal safeguards to which the petitioners are entitled.43

Thus, with that in mind let me further probe into the afore-stated sequence of events which

took place before the decision of the SLMC to expel the Petitioner from the party.

43 at page 239.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 45 of 62

It is Mr. Sumanthiran PCs position that since the Petitioner has failed to show any cause as

to why he had breached the decision of the party and voted in favour of the Appropriation Bill

(2022 Budget), the disciplinary authority is entitled to proceed on the basis that the Petitioner

has no cause to show. Indeed, this is what P9 in its last line has stated. The relevant part is

as follows:

Your explanation in writing in the form of an affidavit should reach me within

fourteen days from the date of the receipt of this letter.

Failure to do so will compel the party to arrive at the conclusion that you have no

cause to show against the said violation of the party decision by you

The letter P9 which called for a written explanation from the Petitioner is dated 27-11-2021.

Time granted for the Petitioner for that purpose is fourteen days. It is important to note, that

the first response by the Petitioner to P9, which is the letter P10 is dated 10-12-2021. That

date is the 14th day since the date of P9. Therefore, as per P9, it is the last day of the deadline

given for the Petitioner to submit his explanation.

In the meantime, the Petitioner having accepted the cabinet portfolio was appointed as the

cabinet minister in charge of environment, on 28-04-2022. Although the Petitioner has stated

in his petition that this appointment was made on 18-04-2022, the 1st, 2nd and 8th Respondents

have brought to the notice of the Court that this appointment was in fact made on 28-04-

2022. The relevant Gazette notification has been produced marked P14(a).

When the Petitioner received P9, he knew very well that an explanation in writing in the form

of an affidavit must be tendered to the secretary of the SLMC within the time designated in

that letter. Moreover, he was also aware of the consequences of any failure on his part to

tender such explanation in the form of an affidavit within that time. This is because in the last

paragraph of that letter, the secretary of the SLMC had clearly communicated to him that any

failure on his part to tender such explanation will compel the party to arrive at the conclusion

that he has no cause to show against the alleged violation of the party decision taken on 21-

11-2021, not to vote in favour of the budget (the appropriation bill 2022) on 22-11-2021 and

at the 3rd reading of that bill as well. In his response in P10 (which is the response of the

Petitioner to P9) the only reason the Petitioner had adduced was that the Petitioner did not

receive any communication as to whether the meeting was held or postponed, or any decision

taken at the meeting. Having stated so, the Petitioner had requested a period of one month

to furnish his response. He had also requested the relevant provisions in the party constitution

under which the leader is said to have exercised his powers to suspend him from the High

Command together with a copy of the party constitution.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 46 of 62

The SLMC had proceeded to grant the further period of one month requested by the Petitioner

by P10 for which the Petitioner had even proceeded to thank the SLMC for accommodating

his request for further time (by P12). Thus, the Petitioner does not allege any unfair refusal

of his request by P10 for further time to tender his written explanation. Therefore, on that

point we cannot hold that the SLMC had breached the Rules of Natural Justice.

The Petitioner writes P12 on 04-01-2022. The one-month time granted by P10 if calculated

from the date of that letter i.e., 10-12-2021, must end on 10-01-2022. P12 is dated 04-01-

2022 and it only requests a copy of the latest party constitution and sections under which the

SLMC had called for the Petitioners explanation. The Petitioner does not request for further

time by P12 to tender his explanation. It is thereafter, that the SLMC by letter dated 14-03-

2022 (produced marked P13) had communicated to the Petitioner, that the Petitioner must

tender his explanation before 15-04-2022. The Petitioner replying to P13 by letter dated 07-

04-2022 marked P14, had stated the following two things.

i. He did not receive any communication as to whether the meeting was held or

postponed or any decision taken at the meeting.

ii. He requests to let him know the relevant provisions in the party constitution under

which the leader is said to have exercised his powers to suspend him from the High

Command position. He also requests a copy of the party constitution.

The Petitioner himself has admitted that the above two things are a mere reproduction of the

contents in P10. The Petitioner in the last paragraph of P14, had stated that the above would

enable him to furnish a more detailed response. It is after consideration of P14 that the SLMC

High Command had made the decision to expel the Petitioner which was communicated by

P15.

The Petitioner does not challenge his expulsion before this Court on the basis that the SLMC

had failed to tender to him a copy of the constitution or its provisions he had requested.

Nevertheless, let me now consider whether the Petitioner has satisfied before this court, that

he could not have tendered a full response without the SLMC complying with his request for

the relevant provisions and a copy of the party constitution.

It is the Petitioner himself who had produced a copy of the SLMC constitution annexed to his

Petition marked P1. This means either he was in possession of the SLMC constitution or he

was capable of easily getting it procured for his use on his own rather than making repeated

requests to the party. Admittedly, the Petitioner is an experienced politician, whose political

career has spanned over 30 years and at the time of his expulsion form the SLMC, he had

held the position of Deputy Leader I of the High Command and the post of the Director of

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 47 of 62

International Affairs, of the party.44 In my view, such an attitude on the part of the Petitioner

cannot be seen as a genuine request made by the Petitioner, the compliance of which by the

SLMC should have been necessary as a pre-requisite to tendering the Petitioners explanation.

I am unable to accept that as aground which would vitiate the decision of the SLMC to expel

him from the party.

The Petitioner has not challenged his expulsion before this court on the basis that the Leader

of the SLMC had no power to suspend him from the High Command position he held. In any

case, what the Petitioner had requested from SLMC is to let him know the relevant provisions

of the SLMC constitution under which the Leader of the SLMC is empowered to suspend him

from his position in the SLMC High Command. As has been already mentioned, the SLMC with

or without powers under the SLMC constitution has suspended the petitioner by P9. The

Petitioner does not seek to challenge P9 in this proceeding. Moreover, the jurisdiction

conferred by Article 99 (13) (a) of Constitution does not empower this court to engage in such

exercise of reviewing a decision to suspend a member form the party. The jurisdiction under

Article 99 (13) (a) is clear in that it only confers jurisdiction on this court to decide whether

the expulsion of a member from a political party is valid or not. That is what the Petitioner

had exactly sought to do in this case. Therefore, I hold that the question whether the SLMC

leader had power under SLMC constitution to suspend the Petitioner by P9 or the question

whether the SLMC should have complied with the Petitioners request to let him know the

relevant provisions in the party constitution under which the Leader had suspended him from

the High Command position, are irrelevant to decide on the validity of the expulsion of the

petitioner which only had happened by P15 which is five months after the date in P9.

The above facts show clearly that the SLMC had tried its best to get an explanation form the

Petitioner but the Petitioner had not cooperated. In the above circumstances, I am unable to

hold that the SLMC had breached the Rules of Natural Justice in the instant case as it had

granted ample opportunities for the Petitioner in the instant case to tender his written

explanation as to why he had violated the party decision taken at the High Command meeting

held on 21-11-2021.

The Petitioner knew very well that his failure to tender written explanation would result in the

party concluding that he has no cause to show against the alleged violation of the party

decision by him. Despite that, the Petitioner was determined to blatantly ignore the last two

paragraphs of P9. Thus, the petitioner was determined not to submit himself to the

disciplinary proceedings initiated by the party. In such a situation, as Kulatunga J held in

44 Vide paragraph 12 of the Affidavit of the Petitioner dated 20-05-2022.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 48 of 62

Gamini Dissanayakes case there is no force in the Petitioners complaint that the party had

failed to give him a hearing.

Moreover, as the Petitioner had determined not to submit himself to the disciplinary

proceedings initiated by the party, he could not have had any legitimate expectation of any

formal inquiry. Therefore, as Lord Denning held in Cinnamonds case, where there is no

legitimate expectation, there is no call for a hearing.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the absence of a formal inquiry has not vitiated the

decision of the SLMC to expel the Petitioner under the circumstances of the instant case.

IS THE DECISION TO EXPEL THE PETITIONER JUSTIFIED?

Let me now consider whether the decision taken by the SLMC to expel the petitioner is justified

on its merits. The main ground on which the Petitioner has sought to canvass his expulsion

from the party is the fact that the SLMC did not conduct a formal inquiry according to the

law.45 For the reasons I have already set out above, I have held that the SLMC had not

breached the Rules of Natural Justice in the instant case as it had granted ample opportunities

for the Petitioner in the instant case to tender his written explanation as to why he had violated

the party decision taken at the High Command meeting held on 21-11-2021. I have also held

that the absence of a formal inquiry has not vitiated the decision of the SLMC to expel the

Petitioner under the circumstances of the instant case. Therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled

to succeed on this ground.

Let me now consider the other grounds urged by the Petitioner. The Petitioner in his petition,

has stated that his expulsion is capricious, manifestly mala fide and is motivated purely by the

clear resentment towards the Petitioner arising inter alia, from the Petitioner being appointed

as a cabinet minister on 18-04-2022.46

Although the Petitioner has stated in some instances that his expulsion was done mala fide,

the Petitioner has not sought to support any of those allegations with evidence.

Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena PC submitted that although it was not only the Petitioner who

voted in favour of the aforesaid Appropriation Bill despite the party decision to vote against

the same, it was only the Petitioner who was expelled from the party. Let me further probe in

to this complaint.

45 Paragraph 55 (c) and (d) of the petition dated 20th May 2022. 46 Paragraph 55 of the petition dated 20th May 2022.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 49 of 62

Four SLMC members namely, the 6th Respondent Hon. H.M.M. Harees, the 16th Respondent

Hon. M.S.M. Thoufeek, the 24th Respondent Hon. Faizal Cassim and the Petitioner had voted

in favour of the aforesaid Appropriation Bill 2022. Indeed, the SLMC had called for

explanations from all of those who had voted in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022. It is in

evidence that the other members involved in the voting had complied with the directive of the

party and tendered their explanations to the SLMC.47 This also explains as to why the High

Command of the SLMC on 22-04-2022 had unanimously resolved (as per the extract from the

minutes produced marked 1R1) to expel the Petitioner from the party membership with

immediate effect and to suspend those three members from the party membership and to

proceed to hold a formal inquiry against them. This goes on to show that those members had

an explanation to be tendered and in fact they did so. However, unlike the other three

members who had tendered their explanations, the Petitioner had determined not to submit

himself to the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the party. In those circumstances, I cannot

resist drawing the inference that the Petitioner in the instant case did not offer any explanation

despite repeated requests from the party, solely because he did not have any explanation to

be given as to why he had voted in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 despite the party

decision to vote against P9.

Another complaint the Petitioner has made in his petition, is that his expulsion is capricious,

manifestly mala fide and is motivated purely by the clear resentment toward the Petitioner

arising inter alia, from the Petitioner being appointed as a cabinet minister on 18-04-2022.

Even if the date of the Petitioner's appointment as the cabinet minister in charge of

environment is taken as 18-04-2022 as stated by the Petitioner, the SLMC had called for a

written explanation from the Petitioner by the letter P9 dated 27-11-2021. Thus, initiating the

disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner had well preceded the event of the Petitioner

being appointed as a cabinet minister. It was only after the exchange of several other letters

between the SLMC and the Petitioner that the SLMC by the letter P15 dated 23-04-2022, had

communicated to the Petitioner about his expulsion from the party. The SLMC had extended

the time for the Petitioner to tender his explanation until 15-04-2022 by P13. The Petitioner

had replied P13 by his letter P14 dated 07-04-2022. Thus, the final deadline for the Petitioner

to tender his explanation had ended on 15-04-2022.

On the above facts, I observe that the active part of the disciplinary proceeding against the

Petitioner which had led to his expulsion from the party had come to an end well before the

date 18-04-2022 on which he claims he was appointed as a cabinet minister.

47 Paragraph 23(f)-(g) of the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent dated 29th September 2022.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 50 of 62

The Petitioners assertion that this appointment was made on 18-04-2022 is factually incorrect

or not supported by evidence he has adduced. The relevant Gazette notification has been

produced marked P14(a). This is the Gazette which the Petitioner relies on, to establish that

this appointment was made on 18-04-2022. However, as pointed out by Mr. Sumanthiran PC,

the relevant Gazette notification is dated 28-04-2022. Thus, The Petitioner has not established

before this Court that this appointment was made on 18-04-2022 as claimed by him. The

SLMC had communicated to the Petitioner that it has unanimously decided to expel him from

the party by P15 which is dated 23-04-2022. Thus, in this sense, I observe that the whole

of the disciplinary proceeding against the Petitioner which had led to his expulsion from the

party had also come to an end well before the Petitioner was appointed as a cabinet minister.

For those reasons, I am unable to accept the Petitioners position that his expulsion is

manifestly mala fide and is motivated purely by the clear resentment towards the Petitioner

arising from the appointment of the Petitioner as a cabinet minister.

The Petitioner in his Petition,48 has also stated that his expulsion is contrary to the provisions

of the provisions of Clauses 8.12, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3 and 13.4 of the Constitution of the SLMC.

The Petitioner had not sought to substantiate these allegations in any other means other than

merely stating in his petition and affidavit that his expulsion is contrary to these clauses of the

SLMC constitution. Nevertheless, let me first reproduce Clauses 13.1 and 13.2 of the

Constitution of the SLMC.

13.1 Where the High Command of the party is in receipt of any information or

complaint, that a member of the Party has committed an act or omission which in its

opinion-

a) amounts to a failure and /or a refusal to perform any one or more duties of a

member or is in conflict with and /or inconsistent with any one or more duties

of a member and /or,

b) prejudicial to the interests and reputation of the Party or the collective

responsibility of the Party.

The member concerned is liable to be dismissed from the membership and expelled

from the Party in terms of the Rules of the High Command in respect of Disciplinary

actions.

13.2 The High Command shall exercise its summary jurisdiction as provided

hereinbefore in respect of disciplinary action in respect of any of its members.

48 At paragraph 55 (a) of the Petition.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 51 of 62

Both of those Clauses in my view, are not in favour of the case advanced by the Petitioner

that the SLMC had wrongly expelled him from the party. This is because any member violating

those clauses have been made specifically liable to be expelled from the party. The Petitioner

by voting in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 has breached his collective responsibility of

the party which he has already willingly undertaken by virtue of signing P5. Then Clause 13.1

makes the Petitioner liable to be expelled from the party. The High Command of the party is

empowered to exercise its summary jurisdiction in respect of such situation. The said summary

jurisdiction is a reference to some earlier provisions in the SLMC constitution. Thus, Clause

8.12 of the SLMC constitution would be relevant in that regard. It is as follows:

Where a member of the Party is deemed to be guilty of misconduct and is liable to

be dismissed from the membership and expelled from the party, the High Command

in its absolute discretion shall be entitled to adopt any procedure it thinks fit and proper

in the circumstances. However, the High Command shall observe the rules relating to

the Principles of Natural Justice in exercising such powers.

This shows that the High Command has been given absolute discretion and powers under the

SLMC constitution to adopt any procedure it thinks fit and proper in a given circumstance

subject to the condition that it should observe rules of natural justice when exercising such

powers. I have already set out above the circumstances prevailed in the instant case. I have

also held above that the SLMC has not breached the Rules of Natural Justice. In those

circumstances, the procedure adopted by the SLMC for its decision by the High Command to

expel the Petitioner from the party, is a procedure well within the Clause 8.12. Clause 13.4 of

the SLMC constitution does not apply to the instant case as the SLMC High Command had not

delegated its disciplinary powers to a smaller committee.

For those reasons, I am unable to accept that the decision to expel the Petitioner from the

SLMC has been done contrary to any of those provisions in the SLMC constitution.

It remains for me only to consider, whether there is merit in the position taken up by the

Petitioner that he was not made aware regarding any decision taken by the High Command

on 21-11-2021 that SLMC Members of Parliament shall not vote in favour of the Appropriation

Bill 2022 at its second reading on 22-11-2021 and at the third reading as well. The 2nd

Respondent (the Leader of the SLMC) in his affidavit has categorically asserted that in the

morning of 22-11-2021, before the commencement of the proceedings in Parliament, a group

meeting of SLMC Members of Parliament was held; the Petitioner was present at the said

Group Meeting; the decision that SLMC Members of Parliament shall not vote in favour of the

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 52 of 62

Appropriation Bill 2022 was re-iterated.49 This factual position has been corroborated by the

followings: the affidavit of the 3rd Respondent (the Secretary of the SLMC) produced marked

1R3; the Attendance Sheet of the Parliamentary Group Meeting of SLMC held on 22-11-2021

produced marked 1R4(a) where the Petitioners signature is found; the affidavit of the 16th

Respondent produced marked 1R4(b); the affidavit of the 24th Respondent produced marked

1R4(c). The Petitioner was content with making only a bare denial of his presence at the

Parliamentary Group Meeting of SLMC held on 22-11-2021 at the Parliament premises in his

counter affidavit.50In the course of the oral submissions, the learned Presidents Counsel who

appeared for the Petitioner submitted that the signature of the Petitioner found in 1R4(a) is

a forged signature. However, I observe that the Petitioner had never taken up such a position

in his Counter Affidavit. Thus, in my view, the Petitioner himself by taking up the above

position which he cannot substantiate, has pushed his assertion that he was not present at

the Parliament premises in the Group Meeting of SLMC held on 22-11-2021, beyond my belief.

I hold that the Petitioner had in fact been present at the Parliament premises in the Group

Meeting of SLMC held in the morning of 22-11-2021 at the Parliament when he was informed

(at the Parliament) by the Leader about the decision of the SLMC that the SLMC Members of

Parliament shall not vote in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022. I further hold that the

Petitioner has not been truthful with regard to the position he has taken up before this Court

in this proceeding.

Let me move further to highlight some of the Petitioners obligations with regard to the

decisions of the Party and his collective responsibility. The Petitioner who was elected to the

Parliament at the General Election held on 05-08-2020, has signed P5 in which he has

accepted inter alia the followings.

i. He has accepted that the provisions of the constitution, code of conduct and all

decisions, resolutions and directives of the High Command, and of the Party would

strictly bind him.

ii. He has accepted that any willful contravention or failure to comply with the provision

of the constitution, code of conduct and /or decisions, directives or resolution of

the High Command, and of the Party shall make him liable to be expelled from

the membership of the Party.

49 Paragraph 23(a)-(c) of the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent dated 29th September 2022.

50 Paragraph 11(d) of the Counter Affidavit of the Petitioner dated 25th November 2022.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 53 of 62

iii. He has accepted that any refusal to subscribe to the annual special pledge of loyalty

shall make him guilty of gross misconduct upon which he shall be liable to be

expelled from the membership of the party by the High Command.

iv. He has accepted that he will always vote in Parliament in accordance with the

mandate of the Party.

v. He has accepted that he will conduct himself at meetings in Parliament with a sense

of collective responsibility and also should on all occasions speak in one voice at

such meetings as per the decisions of the Party.

vi. He has accepted that any violation of the accepted norms and general standards

of party discipline shall make him liable to be expelled from the membership of

the Party.

vii. He has accepted that leaving the island, or being unable to attend the meetings of

the Parliament for any specific reason, he should get prior approval from the

Leader and/or the Secretary of the Party and his failure to do so would result in

disciplinary action being taken against him.

viii. He has accepted that it is his duty to consult the Party leadership, to ascertain the

stand of the Party in respect of any matter before casting, abstaining or taking

any step at the time of voting in the Parliament.

ix. He has accepted that he will not take a stand against and /or not in conformity

and/or not consistent with the policy of the Party.

Moreover, chapter 5 of the constitution of SLMC under the title duties of members of the

party (chapter 5) states the followings:

The following shall inter alia shall be the duties of every member of the Party.

a. Be loyal to the Party and shall recognise honour and submit to the authority of

the hierarchy of the Party.

b. Abide by and honour the provisions of the Constitution, codes of conduct,

decisions, rules, regulations, directives, policies and programmes of the Party

as decided by the High Command,

c. Propagate and defend in public the policies and programmes of the Party.

d. Always conform to the standards laid down in the Code of Conduct of the Party.

e. Regularly attend meetings and sessions of the various bodies and committees

set up and / or recognized by the High Command.

f. Be individually and collectively responsible for his conduct and shall also ensure

that his conduct in no way affects the image or reputation of the Party.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 54 of 62

As has already been mentioned earlier in this judgment, the Petitioner himself has admitted

that he is an experienced politician whose political career has spanned over thirty long

years.51 He held the position of Deputy Leader I of the partys High Command and Director

of International Affairs of the SLMC at the time he was suspended from office by P9. I have

to note that these are assertions made by the Petitioner himself.

In Paragraph 43 of the Petition, the Petitioner had made it clear, that the Petitioner was not

informed of any decision taken at the meeting of the High Command held on 21-11-202. Thus,

it is the position of the Petitioner that he had voted in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 at

its second reading held in Parliament on 22-11-2021 as he was not informed of any such

decision taken at the SLMC High Command meeting held on 21-11-2021.

The Petitioner had voted in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 at its second reading on 22-

11-2021. I note that the first letter P9, sent to the Petitioner by the SLMC is dated 27-11-

2021. In paragraph 44 of the Petition, the Petitioner has admitted the receipt of said letter.

The Petitioner states that he was shocked and surprised to receive such a letter. The Petitioner

would have stated so to convince Court that he did not know the existence of any decision

taken at the SLMC High Command meeting held on 21-11-2021 not to vote in favour of the

Appropriation Bill 2022.

In signing P5 the Petitioner has undertaken/promised: to vote in Parliament in accordance

with the mandate of the Party; to conduct himself at meetings in Parliament with a sense of

collective responsibility; to speak on all occasions in one voice at meetings as per the decisions

of the Party. He has also accepted that it is his duty to consult the Party leadership, to ascertain

the stand of the Party in respect of any matter before casting, abstaining or taking any step

at the time of voting in Parliament. It is the Petitioner himself who has produced P5. Despite

the above acceptances and undertakings, the Petitioner has not adduced any reason as to

why he had failed to consult the Party leadership, to ascertain the stand of the Party before

voting in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 at its second reading in the Parliament.

I also note that the Petitioner had thereafter proceeded to vote at the third reading of the

Appropriation Bill 2022 on 10-12-2021. Why did the Petitioner vote at the third reading? Was

it because the Petitioner even by that time, did not know that there was a decision made by

the SLMC High Command that its members should not vote in favour of the Appropriation Bill

2022? The Petitioner is silent as to why he had voted at the third reading. He also has not

adduced any basis as to why he had voted at the third reading.

51 Vide paragraph 12 of the Affidavit of the Petitioner dated 20-05-2022.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 55 of 62

It was on 10-12-2021 that the Petitioner had voted at the third reading of the Appropriation

Bill 2022. The SLMC had first called for explanation from the Petitioner by letter P9, dated 27-

11-2021. The Petitioner has admitted the receipt of P9. Then am I to take the unsupported

bare averment in the affidavit of the Petitioner that he did not know of any such decision of

SLMC High Command taken on 21-11-2021 to be truthful? The answer in the above

circumstances, is clearly no. Thus, in my view, what the Petitioner has established according

to his own documents before this Court is only the fact that he has not been truthful on this

before this Court.

Although the Petitioner at some occasions had sought to challenge the authority of the SLMC

to suspend or expel him from the party membership, I observe that by signing P5, the

Petitioner has clearly accepted the authority of the SLMC and of the party High Command to

suspend or expel him from the party membership. Thus, as far as the Petitioner is concerned,

the authority of the SLMC is an admitted fact. Then why does he want to rely on the party

constitution in that regard? In the same way in view of the undertakings/promises the

Petitioner has made in P5 as shown before in this judgment, the Petitioner has not adduced

any basis/reason as to why he would have wanted to rely on the party constitution in that

regard.

In the above circumstances, what is the explanation he has tendered as to why he had voted

in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 at its second reading held in Parliament? I hold that

the answer is none. It must be noted that the Petitioners expulsion as per P15 had occurred

after the lapse of approximately five months from the communication of P9 calling upon the

Petitioner, to show cause. The SLMC had tried its best to get an explanation form the Petitioner

but the Petitioner had not cooperated. For the foregoing reasons, I am unable to accept the

Petitioners position that his expulsion is completely arbitrary, discriminatory and tainted with

serious mala fides.

In Tilak Karunaratnes case, Dheeraratna J in the majority judgment of this Court referring

to the violation of party discipline within a registered political party, has held as follows:

A political party is a voluntary association of individuals who have come together

with the avowed object of securing political power on agreed policies and a

leadership. Cohesion is a sine qua non of success and stability whether a political

party is in power or in the opposition. To foster party cohesion discipline among its

members becomes absolutely necessary. Party disintegration has to be arrested by

firm disciplinary measures that include expulsion which Article 99 (13) (a) of our

Constitution itself recognizes. The members of a party are bound together by a

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 56 of 62

contract which is usually the party constitution, from which arises contractual

obligations of the membership. These obligations are either express or implied .52

In Gamini Dissanayake's case, Kulatunga J in the majority judgment of this Court having

regard to the fact that the UNP Constitution has imposed on all its members obligations such

as: the duty to harmonize with the policy and code of conduct of the party; the duty to be

bound by the directions of the Leader or the Deputy Leader regarding matters in Parliament;

the duty to vote in Parliament according to the Mandate of the Parliamentary Party conveyed

through the party whip; observed as follows:

I can see no illegality in these arrangements for group action. How can any

government or opposition function without disruption if the conduct of M.P.s as a

group cannot be regulated including in the matter of voting in the House and each

M.P. is free to do whatever he pleases? How can the party fulfil its mandate given

to it by the electors? Can an individual M.P. who has been elected on the party

vote and policy be heard to say " from today I am a free man, the party and the

group are secondary and are subordinate to me "? Can Parliamentary business be

transacted without the party having some assurance as to how the M.P.s are going

to vote? I see no evil in reasonable restrictions on the conduct of M.P.s in

Parliament based on group action or in the obligation to harmonize with party

policy or in the Whip system all of which have the effect of ensuring the smooth

functioning of Parliament itself and peace, order and good government.

In this country the electors elect a government for six years after an election which

is often bitterly fought and in recent times in conditions of turmoil and death. It is

then the duty of both the opposition and the government, owed to the people, to

ensure as far as possible, stable government. The Constitution has frozen party

composition in the House for the duration of Parliament and made provision for

vacation of seats where a Member of Parliament ceases by resignation, expulsion

or otherwise to be a member of the recognized political party or independent group

on whose nomination paper his name appeared at the time of his election to

Parliament. It is not our function to examine the wisdom of these provisions the

object of which, I believe, is to achieve stability of government. Group action, party

discipline and the Whip system are complimentary. If we declare these

arrangements to be invalid we would be making the Constitution unworkable and

52 At page 111.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 57 of 62

as Sir John Donaldson MR observed in Waltham Forest case (Supra) " We

should......... be criticizing the system operating in Parliament itself."

On the other hand, the Petitioner's challenge to his expulsion is not on the basis that he has

a right to go against the decision of SLMC High Command made on 21-11-2021 that its

members should not vote in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022. Moreover, the Petitioner

has pledged that he would be loyal to the Party; shall recognize honour and submit to the

authority of the hierarchy of the Party; abide by and honour its decisions, rules, regulations,

directives, policies of the Party as decided by the High Command. But the Petitioner has not

only breached this solemn pledge but also has deliberately refrained from giving any

explanation for his conduct. He has also determined not to submit himself to the authority of

the Party. In those circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, I hold that the decision made

by the SLMC to expel the Petitioner from the party by letter P15 dated 23.04.2022, is valid in

law.

I proceed to dismiss this Petition.

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

S. Thurairaja PC J

I agree,

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

Samayawardhena J

The gravamen of the Petitioners complaint is that the decision to expel him from the

Party was taken without giving him a hearing in violation of the rules of natural justice

audi alteram partem. If it is correct, I accept that the decision must be declared to

be no decision. However, on the facts and circumstances of this case, I cannot subscribe

to the assertion that the rules of natural justice were violated.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 58 of 62

The Secretary of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress sent P9 to the Petitioner requiring him

to show cause for his decision to vote in favour of the Appropriation Bill for 2022

(Budget) in violation of the decision of the Party High Command taken at the Meeting

held on 21.11.2021. P9 dated 27.11.2021 reads as follows:

As you are aware, the Party called for a High Command meeting on 21.11.2021

at the Party headquarters Dharussalam, to discuss and decide on the Party

stand vis--vis the 2022 Budget (The Appropriation Bill).

You are also aware that at this meeting, it was decided unanimously, that

Members of Parliament being members of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, shall

not vote in favour of the Budget at its second reading vote on 22.11.2021 and

shall not vote in favour at the third reading vote as well.

You, however, on 22.11.2021 voted in favour of the said Budget at its second

reading, in blatant violation of the said decision of the High Command.

In doing so, you have acted in breach of the Party decision while holding a

senior and substantial position in the Party High Command namely, Deputy

Leader.

In the circumstances, the Party Leader, exercising his powers under the Party

Constitution, has decided to suspend you from the High Command position

held by you and to call for explanation on the said breach of the Party decision.

Therefore, as instructed by the Leader, I do hereby call for your explanation of

your decision to vote in favour of the 2022 Budget in violation of the Party

decision.

Your explanation in writing in the form of an affidavit should reach me within

fourteen days from the date of the receipt of this letter.

Failure to do so will compel the Party to arrive at the conclusion that you have

no cause to show against the said violation of the Party decision by you.

The Petitioner was the Deputy Leader of the party at that time. The Petitioner replied to

P9 by P10 taking up an unusual position that he was unaware of the Party decision

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 59 of 62

regarding how to vote at the Budget since he could not attend the said Meeting. P10

dated 10.12.2021 reads as follows:

I am in receipt of your letter dated 27.11.2021 informing me that you have

been requested by the SLMC Leader claiming to exercise powers under the

Party Constitution, has decided to suspend me from the High Command

position held by me and to call for my reasons for my voting in favour of the

Budget on 22.11.2021.

You also refer to a meeting of the High Command scheduled for 21.11.2021 at

the Party headquarters, which I could not attend. You are aware, the said High

Command meeting had been summoned at very short notice and I was not

able to attend the said meeting due to reasons beyond my control which I had

duly notified to you. I did not receive any communication whether the meeting

was held or postponed or of any decision taken at the meeting.

I wish to inform you that I require a period of one month to furnish my response

to your queries due to pre-arranged programmes and would thank you to

oblige. Meanwhile please let me know the relevant provisions in the Party

Constitution under which the Leader is said to have exercised his powers to

suspend me from the High Command position together with a copy of the

relevant Constitution.

When P10 is read contextually it is clear that the Petitioner was more concerned about

his suspension from the post of the Deputy Leader of the Party than showing cause to

the main allegation that he violated the decision of the Party High Command in relation

to the voting for the Budget. His request in P10 for a copy of the Party Constitution is

related to his removal from the High Command position and is irrelevant to the matter

under consideration in this application, which is expulsion. By P10 he sought a period of

one month to show cause.

There was some correspondence exchanged between the Petitioner and the Party during

that time. He was granted extended time to show cause.

Nearly five months after P10 whereby the Petitioner sought a period of one month to

show cause, the Petitioner wrote P14 to the Party Secretary. By P14, the Petitioner did

not show cause, which he undertook to do by P10 but merely quoted the contents of

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 60 of 62

P10 verbatim. He did not seek further time to show cause why he voted in favour of the

Budget. P14 dated 07.04.2022 reads as follows:

I am in receipt of your letter dated 14.03.2022.

In my response letter to you dated 10.12.2021, I had explained as follows:

You also refer to a meeting of the High Command scheduled for 21.11.2021

at the party headquarters, which I could not attend. You are aware, the said

High Command meeting had been summoned at very short notice and I was

not able to attend the said meeting due to reasons beyond my control which I

had duly notified to you. I did not receive any communication whether the

meeting was held or postponed or of any decision taken at the meeting.

Meanwhile please let me know the relevant provisions in the party Constitution

under which the Leader is said to have exercised his powers to suspend me

from the High Command position together with a copy of the relevant

Constitution.

You will note that you have not made available the relevant information and a

copy of the relevant Constitution as yet. I shall therefore request you to furnish

me with the relevant information and a copy of the relevant Constitution which

are undoubtedly available to you, at your earliest convenience, to enable me

to furnish a more detailed response further to your request.

As indicated in P10, the relevant information and a copy of the relevant Constitution

refers to the relevant provisions in the party Constitution under which the Leader is said

to have exercised his powers to suspend [him] from the High Command position. As I

understand the Petitioner requests a copy of the relevant Constitution because

according to him the Constitution which is available does not have a provision which

empowers the Party Leader to suspend him from the High Command position. As I have

already stated, this Court is not concerned about suspension but only expulsion.

In my view, if he did not show cause in response to P9, there is no necessity to fix the

matter for the formal inquiry. The Petitioner cannot now be heard to say that the failure

to hold a formal inquiry is a violation of the rules of natural justice. The rules of natural

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 61 of 62

justice are not written in stone; whether or not these rules have been violated must be

determined based on the unique facts and circumstances of each individual case.

It is after receipt of P14 and after due considerations of all these relevant matters the

High Command has unanimously resolved to expel the Petitioner from Party Membership

with immediate effect on the basis that you have no cause to show. This was informed

to the Petitioner by P15 dated 23.04.2022, which reads as follows:

Disciplinary Action Expulsion from the Party (Sri Lanka Muslim

Congress) Membership

I received your letter dated 7th April 2022.

Your letter was placed before the High Command of the Party which met on

22.04.2022.

The High Command noted that you have not given any reason for violating the

Party decision taken at the High Command meeting held on 21.11.2021, except

to plead your purported ignorance of the said decision.

High Command noted that the said decision was not only conveyed to you by

the leader but also was given huge publicity through the media.

The High Command also noted that,

1. You are well aware the said meeting on 21.11.2021 was summoned for the

specific purpose of taking a decision as to the Partys stance on the

governments proposed Appropriation Bill for the year 2021/2022, as it was

spelled out in the invitation SMS sent by the Secretary.

2. You are also aware that the Secretary has not sent any message, cancelling

or postponing the meeting. On the contrary you have sent SMS to the

Secretary, excusing your attendance, which you have admitted in your letter.

Hence, the High Command proceeded to consider the action to be taken

against you on the basis that you have no cause to show.

[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 62 of 62

After due considerations of all these relevant matters the High Command has

unanimously resolved to expel you from Party Membership with immediate

effect.

Accordingly, on the instructions of the Party I do hereby communicate that

your Party Membership from Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is duly terminated and

as a result you have ceased to be a Member of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress

the political Party from which you were elected to the present Parliament.

The Petitioner was aware that the High Command Meeting on 21.11.2021 was to take a

decision on how to vote at the Second and Third Readings of the Budget. The Petitioner

who was the Deputy Leader of the Party opted not to attend this important Meeting.

The First Reading of the Budget was on 22.11.2021 and there was a Parliamentary Group

Meeting of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress held on the morning of 22.11.2021 in the

Parliamentary premises just before the First Reading of the Budget. How can the

Petitioner make a sweeping statement in P10 that I did not receive any communication

whether the meeting was held or postponed or of any decision taken at the meeting

and remain silent? He was not a Party supporter but the Deputy Leader of the Party.

Let me assume for a moment that he was unaware of the Party decision taken on

21.11.2021 before he voted in favour of the Budget on 22.11.2021. What about his

voting in favour of the budget at the Third Reading, which happened on 10.12.2021,

admittedly after he received P9 dated 27.11.2021 wherein it was specifically mentioned

the Party decision that Members of Parliament being members of the Sri Lanka Muslim

Congress, shall not vote in favour of the budget at its second reading vote on 22.11.2021

and shall not vote in favour at the third reading vote as well? The Petitioner cannot

plead ignorance of the Party decision in respect of voting at the Third Reading of the

Budget.

I see no reason to interfere with the decision of the Party as reflected in P15. The

application of the Petitioner shall stand dismissed. No costs.
