"[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 49 of 62"
"Four SLMC members namely, the 6th Respondent Hon. H.M.M. Harees, the 16th Respondent"
"Hon. M.S.M. Thoufeek, the 24th Respondent Hon. Faizal Cassim and the Petitioner had voted"
"in  favour  of  the  aforesaid  Appropriation  Bill  2022.  Indeed,  the  SLMC  had  called  for"
"explanations from all of those who had voted in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022. It is in"
"evidence that the other members involved in the voting had complied with the directive of the"
"party and tendered their explanations to the SLMC.47 This also explains as to why the High"
"Command of the SLMC on 22-04-2022 had unanimously resolved (as per the extract from the"
"minutes  produced  marked  1R1)  to  expel  the  Petitioner  from  the  party  membership  with"
"immediate effect and to suspend those three members from the party membership and to"
"proceed to hold a formal inquiry against them. This goes on to show that those members had"
"an  explanation  to  be  tendered  and  in  fact  they  did  so.  However,  unlike  the  other  three"
"members who had tendered their explanations, the Petitioner had determined not to submit"
"himself to the disciplinary proceedings initiated by the party. In those circumstances, I cannot"
"resist drawing the inference that the Petitioner in the instant case did not offer any explanation"
"despite repeated requests from the party, solely because he did not have any explanation to"
"be given as to why he had voted in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 despite the party"
"decision to vote against  P9."
"Another complaint the Petitioner has made in his petition, is that his expulsion is capricious,"
"manifestly mala fide and is motivated purely by the clear resentment toward the Petitioner"
"arising inter alia, from the Petitioner being appointed as a cabinet minister on 18-04-2022."
"Even  if  the  date  of  the  Petitioner's  appointment  as  the  cabinet  minister  in  charge  of"
"environment is taken as 18-04-2022 as stated by the Petitioner, the SLMC had called for a"
"written explanation from the Petitioner by the letter P9 dated 27-11-2021. Thus, initiating the"
"disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner had well preceded the event of the Petitioner"
"being appointed as a cabinet minister. It was only after the exchange of several other letters"
"between the SLMC and the Petitioner that the SLMC by the letter P15 dated 23-04-2022, had"
"communicated to the Petitioner about his expulsion from the party. The SLMC had extended"
"the time for the Petitioner to tender his explanation until 15-04-2022 by P13. The Petitioner"
"had replied P13 by his letter P14 dated 07-04-2022. Thus, the final deadline for the Petitioner"
"to tender his explanation had ended on 15-04-2022."
"On the above facts, I observe that the active part of the disciplinary proceeding against the"
"Petitioner which had led to his expulsion from the party had come to an end well before the"
"date 18-04-2022 on which he claims he was appointed as a cabinet minister."
"47 Paragraph 23(f)-(g) of the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent  dated 29th September 2022."
