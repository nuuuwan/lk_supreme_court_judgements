"[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 50 of 62"
"The Petitioner’s assertion that this appointment was made on 18-04-2022 is factually incorrect"
"or  not  supported  by  evidence  he  has  adduced.  The  relevant Gazette  notification  has  been"
"produced marked P14(a). This is the Gazette which the Petitioner relies on, to establish that"
"this appointment was made on 18-04-2022. However, as pointed out by Mr. Sumanthiran PC,"
"the relevant Gazette notification is dated 28-04-2022. Thus, The Petitioner has not established"
"before  this  Court  that  this  appointment  was  made  on  18-04-2022  as  claimed  by  him.  The"
"SLMC had communicated to the Petitioner that it has unanimously decided to expel him from"
"the party by P15 which is dated 23-04-2022. Thus, in this sense,  I observe that the whole"
"of the disciplinary proceeding against the Petitioner which had led to his expulsion from the"
"party had also come to an end well before the Petitioner was appointed as a cabinet minister."
"For  those  reasons,  I  am  unable  to  accept  the  Petitioner’s  position  that  his  expulsion  is"
"manifestly mala fide and is motivated purely by the clear resentment towards the Petitioner"
"arising from the appointment of the Petitioner as a cabinet minister."
"The Petitioner in his Petition,48 has also stated that his expulsion is contrary to the provisions"
"of the provisions of Clauses 8.12, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3 and 13.4 of the Constitution of the SLMC."
"The Petitioner had not sought to substantiate these allegations in any other means other than"
"merely stating in his petition and affidavit that his expulsion is contrary to these clauses of the"
"SLMC  constitution.  Nevertheless,  let  me  first  reproduce  Clauses  13.1  and  13.2  of  the"
"Constitution of the SLMC."
