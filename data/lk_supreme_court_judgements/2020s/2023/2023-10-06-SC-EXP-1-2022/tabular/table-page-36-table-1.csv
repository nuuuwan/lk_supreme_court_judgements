"I
 
can see the force of that argument. But it only applies when there is a legitimate"
"expectation of being heard. In cases where there is no legitimate expectation, there"
"i
s
 
no call for a hearing. We have given some illustrations in earlier cases. I ventured"

g
i
ve two in R v Gaming Board for Great Britain, ex parte Benaim [1970] 2 All ER"
"528 at 533, [1970] 2 QB 417 at 430. I instanced the Board of Trade when they"
"granted industrial development certificates, or the television authorities when it"
"awarded television programme contracts. In administrative decisions of that kind,"
"a
 hearing does not have to be given to those who may be disappointed. Only"
"recently in Norwest Holst Ltd v Department of Trade [1978] 3 All ER 280 at 292,"
"[1978] Ch 201 at 224 I gave the instance of a police officer who is suspended for"
"m
i
sconduct. Pending investigations, he is suspended on full pay. He is not given"
"any notice of the charge at that stage, nor any opportunity of being heard. Likewise,"
"t
he Stock Exchange may suspend dealings in a broker's shares. In none of these"
"cases is it necessary to have a hearing."
"Applying those principles, suppose that these car-hire drivers were of good"
"character and had for years been coming into the airport under an implied license"
"t
o
 do so. If in that case there was suddenly a prohibition order preventing them"
"f
rom entering, then it would seem only fair that they should be given a hearing and"
"a
 
chance to put their case. But that is not this case. These men have a long record"
"o
f
 
convictions. They have large fines outstanding. They are continuing to engage in"
"conduct which they must know is unlawful and contrary to the byelaws. When they"
"were summonsed for past offences, they put their case, no doubt, to the"
"magistrates and to the Crown Court. Now when the patience of the authority is"
"exhausted, it seems to me that the authority can properly suspend them until"
"f
urther notice, just like the police officer I mentioned. In the circumstances they"
"had no legitimate expectation of being heard. It is not a necessary preliminary that"
"t
hey should have a hearing or be given a further chance to explain. Remembering"
"a
l
ways this: that it must have been apparent to them why the prohibition was"
"ordered, and equally apparent that, if they had a change of heart and were ready"
"t
o
 
comply with the rules, no doubt the prohibition would be withdrawn. They could"
"have made representations immediately, if they wished, in answer to the prohibition"
"order. That they did not do."
"The simple duty of the airport authority was to act fairly and reasonably. It seems"
"t
o
 me that it has acted fairly and reasonably. I find nothing wrong in the course"
