"As has already been mentioned earlier in this judgment, the Petitioner himself has admitted"
"that  he  is  an  experienced  politician  whose  political  career  has  spanned  over  ‘thirty  long"
"years’.51 He held the position of Deputy Leader I of the party’s High Command and Director"
"of International Affairs of the SLMC at the time he was suspended from office by P9. I have"
"to note that these are assertions made by the Petitioner himself."
"In Paragraph 43 of the Petition, the Petitioner had made it clear, that the Petitioner was not"
"informed of any decision taken at the meeting of the High Command held on 21-11-202. Thus,"
"it is the position of the Petitioner that he had voted in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 at"
"its  second  reading  held  in  Parliament  on  22-11-2021  as  he  was  not  informed  of  any  such"
"decision taken at the SLMC High Command meeting held on 21-11-2021."
"The Petitioner had voted in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 at its second reading on 22-"
"11-2021. I note that the first letter P9, sent to the Petitioner by the SLMC is dated 27-11-"
"2021. In paragraph 44 of the Petition, the Petitioner has admitted the receipt of said letter."
"The Petitioner states that he was shocked and surprised to receive such a letter. The Petitioner"
"would have stated so to convince Court that he did not know the existence of any decision"
"taken at the SLMC High Command meeting held on 21-11-2021 not to vote in favour of the"
"Appropriation Bill 2022."
"In signing P5 the Petitioner has undertaken/promised: to vote in Parliament in accordance"
"with the mandate of the Party; to conduct himself at meetings in Parliament with a sense of"
"collective responsibility; to speak on all occasions in one voice at meetings as per the decisions"
"of the Party. He has also accepted that it is his duty to consult the Party leadership, to ascertain"
"the stand of the Party in respect of any matter before casting, abstaining or taking any step"
"at the time of voting in Parliament. It is the Petitioner himself who has produced P5. Despite"
"the above acceptances and undertakings, the Petitioner has not adduced any reason as to"
"why he had failed to consult the Party leadership, to ascertain the stand of the Party before"
"voting in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022 at its second reading in the Parliament."
"I also note that the Petitioner had thereafter proceeded to vote at the third reading of the"
"Appropriation Bill 2022 on 10-12-2021. Why did the Petitioner vote at the third reading? Was"
"it because the Petitioner even by that time, did not know that there was a decision made by"
"the SLMC High Command that its members should not vote in favour of the Appropriation Bill"
"2022? The Petitioner is silent as to why he had voted at the third reading. He also has not"
"adduced any basis as to why he had voted at the third reading."
