"[Expulsion 01/ 2022] Page 40 of 62"
"a
 fair opportunity was given to the Petitioners to state their case, and an oral"
"hearing became unnecessary as the facts were "" undisputed in consequence of their"
"replies. I hold that the Petitioners, case had received - overall - full and fair"
"consideration, and that there had been a fair result, reached by fair methods”.40"
"Kulatunga J (Wadugodapitiya J agreeing) in Jayatillake’s case, in his judgment rejecting the"
"allegation that the expulsion of the petitioners was invalid for contravention of Rules of Natural"
"Justice proceeded to hold as follows:"
"“I am of the view that the Working Committee had done everything possible to hold"
"a
 full and fair hearing on the second occasion. The petitioners, however had"
"defected from the Party and were irreconcilable. They were not interested in"
"answering the allegations adequately and relied on mere jurisdictional grounds and"
"bald denials. The learned President’s Counsel for the petitioners told us that the"
"petitioners were not bound to disclose their material or to disclose the reasons for"
"t
heir failure to attend Parliament on 10.10.91. If so, the petitioners are themselves"
"t
o
 blame for their predicament. I have taken this view in the light of the following"
"considerations:-"
"a)  The rights of the petitioners to Party membership are contractual. At the time of"
"t
heir expulsion, they had repudiated the UNP and were de facto members of the"
"DUNF; and their expulsion constituted nothing more than the severance of the"
"f
ormal link between them and the Party. It follows that if they wished to remain in"
"t
he Party they should have taken the initiative and cooperated with the Party by"
"making a full and frank disclosure of their defence. If they failed to do so, they must"
"t
ake the consequences."
"b)  In handling a crisis of the magnitude faced by the respondents and in dealing with"
"men of the petitioners' calibre, a political party must be allowed a discretion to"
"decide what sanctions are appropriate for violations of Party discipline; and if the"
"Party decides, bona fide, to expel any member guilty of repudiating the Party, as"
"t
he petitioners have done, this Court will not in the exercise of its constitutional"
"j
urisdiction impose such member on the Party. If that is done, Parliamentary"
"Government based on the Political Party System will become unworkable."
"I
 am satisfied that the disciplinary proceedings against the petitioners were, in all the"
"c
i
rcumstances, fair”.41"
