"In Gamini Dissanayake's  case,  Kulatunga  J  in  the  majority  judgment when  considering  the"
"question  whether  such  a  procedure  could  be  justified  had  referred  to  and  adopted  with"
"approval, the approach Lord Denning had taken in Cinnamond‘s case.38That was to justify the"

"In Jayatillake and another Vs. Kaleel and others,39  (hereinafter  referred  to  as Jayatillake’s"
"case), two petitioners who are Members of Parliament filed petition in this Court invoking its"
"jurisdiction under Article 99 (13) (a) of the Constitution challenging their expulsion from the"
"United National Party (UNP). In that case, the Disciplinary Committee of the Party's Working"
"Committee recommended on 3-12-1991 to take disciplinary action against the Petitioners on"
"account of several matters. The Working Committee met at 7.00 p.m. on the same day and,"
"having considered the Report of the Disciplinary Committee and the letters dated 9-10-1991"
"written  by  the  Petitioners,  decided  that  the  General  Secretary  should  write  to  these  two"
"members, requesting them to be present at a meeting of the Working Committee to be held"
"on 06-12-1991 at 8.00 p.m. “for the purpose of discussing their conduct as members of the"
"Party"".  No  particulars  were  given  to  the  petitioners.  Admittedly,  the  petitioners  had  not"
"received those letters on or before 06-12-1991. Assuming that the Petitioners had received"
"notice, the Working Committee duly met on 06-12-1991, considered the relevant material and"
"then resolved to expel the petitioners in that case from the Party, with immediate effect, for"
"the  reasons  given  in  the  letters  dated  09-12-1991  and  communicated  to  the  petitioners  of"
"their expulsion. The petitioners before they received the letters from the party communicating"
"their expulsion, had sent letters dated 09-12-1991 to the UNP to inform that they were not in"
"receipt of letters informing them that the meeting of the Working Committee was to be held"
"on 06-12-1991 at 8.00 p.m. However, neither Petitioner had requested another opportunity"
"of appearing before the Working Committee. Nevertheless, the UNP had sent letters to the"
"petitioners  asking  the  petitioners  to  submit  written  observations  stating  their  position  with"
"regard to the charges before 27-12-1991. The petitioners had received those letters on 23-"
"12-1991 and they had replied. The Working Committee met on 30-12-1991; they considered"
"the Petitioners' replies dated 26-12-1991. The Working Committee decided that the Petitioners"
"had not adduced any facts or reasons to justify further inquiry and accordingly, decided not"
