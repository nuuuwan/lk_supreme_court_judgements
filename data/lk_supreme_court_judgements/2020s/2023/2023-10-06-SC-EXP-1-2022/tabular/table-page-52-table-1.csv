"Appropriation Bill 2022 was re-iterated.49 This factual position has been corroborated by the"
"followings: the affidavit of the 3rd Respondent (the Secretary of the SLMC) produced marked"
"1R3; the Attendance Sheet of the Parliamentary Group Meeting of SLMC held on 22-11-2021"
"produced marked 1R4(a) where the Petitioners signature is found; the affidavit of the 16th"
"Respondent produced marked 1R4(b); the affidavit of the 24th Respondent produced marked"
"1R4(c). The Petitioner was content with making only a bare denial of his presence at the"
"Parliamentary Group Meeting of SLMC held on 22-11-2021 at the Parliament premises in his"
"counter affidavit.50In the course of the oral submissions, the learned President’s Counsel who"
"appeared for the Petitioner submitted that the signature of the Petitioner found in 1R4(a) is"
"a forged signature. However, I observe that the Petitioner had never taken up such a position"
"in  his  Counter  Affidavit.  Thus,  in  my  view,  the  Petitioner  himself  by  taking  up  the  above"
"position which he cannot substantiate, has pushed his assertion that he was not present at"
"the Parliament premises in the Group Meeting of SLMC held on 22-11-2021, beyond my belief."
"I hold that the Petitioner had in fact been present at the Parliament premises in the Group"
"Meeting of SLMC held in the morning of 22-11-2021 at the Parliament when he was informed"
"(at the Parliament) by the Leader about the decision of the SLMC that the SLMC Members of"
"Parliament  shall  not  vote  in  favour  of  the  Appropriation  Bill  2022.  I  further  hold  that  the"
"Petitioner has not been truthful with regard to the position he has taken up before this Court"
"in this proceeding."
"Let  me  move  further  to  highlight  some  of  the  Petitioner’s  obligations  with  regard  to  the"
"decisions of the Party and his collective responsibility. The Petitioner who was elected to the"
"Parliament  at  the  General  Election  held  on  05-08-2020,  has  signed  P5  in  which  he  has"
"accepted inter alia the followings."
