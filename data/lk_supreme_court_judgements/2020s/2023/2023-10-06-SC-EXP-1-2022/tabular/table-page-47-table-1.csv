"International Affairs’, of the party.44 In my view, such an attitude on the part of the Petitioner"
"cannot be seen as a genuine request made by the Petitioner, the compliance of which by the"
"SLMC should have been necessary as a pre-requisite to tendering the Petitioner’s explanation."
"I am unable to accept that as aground which would vitiate the decision of the SLMC to expel"
"him from the party."
"The Petitioner has not challenged his expulsion before this court on the basis that the Leader"
"of the SLMC had no power to suspend him from the High Command position he held. In any"
"case, what the Petitioner had requested from SLMC is to let him know the relevant provisions"
"of the SLMC constitution under which the Leader of the SLMC is empowered to suspend him"
"from his position in the SLMC High Command. As has been already mentioned, the SLMC with"
"or  without  powers  under  the  SLMC  constitution  has  suspended  the  petitioner  by  P9.  The"
"Petitioner  does  not  seek  to  challenge  P9  in  this  proceeding.  Moreover,  the  jurisdiction"
"conferred by Article 99 (13) (a) of Constitution does not empower this court to engage in such"
"exercise of reviewing a decision to suspend a member form the party. The jurisdiction under"
"Article 99 (13) (a) is clear in that it only confers jurisdiction on this court to decide whether"
"the expulsion of a member from a political party is valid or not. That is what the Petitioner"
"had exactly sought to do in this case. Therefore, I hold that the question whether the SLMC"
"leader had power under SLMC constitution to suspend the Petitioner by  P9 or the question"
"whether  the  SLMC  should  have  complied  with  the  Petitioner’s request  to  let  him  know  the"
"relevant provisions in the party constitution under which the Leader had suspended him from"
"the High Command position, are irrelevant to decide on the validity of the expulsion of the"
"petitioner which only had happened by P15 which is five months after the date in P9."
"The above facts show clearly that the SLMC had tried its best to get an explanation form the"
"Petitioner but the Petitioner had not cooperated. In the above circumstances, I am unable to"
"hold that the SLMC had breached the Rules of Natural Justice in the instant case as it had"
"granted  ample  opportunities  for  the  Petitioner  in  the  instant  case  to  tender  his  written"
"explanation as to why he had violated the party decision taken at the High Command meeting"
"held on 21-11-2021."
"The Petitioner knew very well that his failure to tender written explanation would result in the"
"party  concluding  that  he  has  no  cause  to  show  against  the  alleged  violation  of  the  party"
"decision by him. Despite that, the Petitioner was determined to blatantly ignore the last two"
"paragraphs  of  P9.  Thus,  the  petitioner  was  determined  not  to  submit  himself  to  the"
"disciplinary  proceedings  initiated  by  the  party.  In  such  a  situation,  as  Kulatunga  J  held  in"
"44 Vide paragraph 12 of the Affidavit of the Petitioner dated 20-05-2022."
