"Mr. Sumanthiran PC, appearing for the 1st, 2nd and 8th Respondents (i.e., the SLMC, its Leader,"
"its Secretary respectively) conceded that the SLMC had not held a formal inquiry against the"
"Petitioner before issuing P15. However, it was his submission that the Petitioner has failed"
"first to show cause that he has a prima facie tenable explanation, which he is bound to tender"
"in the first place, as response to P9."
"Finally, Mr. Sumanthiran, PC, also submitted that the antecedent hearing that the Supreme"
"Court has given to the Petitioner on the totality of the case would satisfy the compliance of"
"Rules  of  Natural  Justice  (Principle  of  ‘Audi  Alteram  Partem’)  as  far  as  the  validity  of  the"
"Petitioner’s expulsion from the party is concerned. It was therefore his submission that even"
"on that ground the absence of a formal inquiry the instant case would not vitiate the decision"
"of the SLMC to expel the Petitioner."
"Let me now consider whether the absence of a formal inquiry has vitiated the decision of the"
"SLMC to expel the Petitioner in the instant case. In order to consider this aspect of the case,"
"let me first outline the sequence of events which had led to the High Command of the SLMC"
"to unanimously resolve to expel the Petitioner from party membership with immediate effect."
"The SLMC has called for a written explanation from the Petitioner by the letter dated 27-11-"
"2021 (produced marked P9) signed by the Respondent who is the Secretary of the SLMC."
