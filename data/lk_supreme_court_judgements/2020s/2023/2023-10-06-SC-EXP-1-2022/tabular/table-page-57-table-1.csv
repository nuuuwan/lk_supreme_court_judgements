"as Sir John Donaldson MR observed in Waltham Forest case (Supra) "" We"
"should......... be criticizing the system operating in Parliament itself."""
"On the other hand, the Petitioner's challenge to his expulsion is not on the basis that he has"
"a  right  to  go  against  the  decision  of  SLMC  High  Command  made  on  21-11-2021  that  its"
"members should not vote in favour of the Appropriation Bill 2022. Moreover, the Petitioner"
"has pledged that he would be loyal to the Party; shall recognize honour and submit to the"
"authority of the hierarchy of the Party; abide by and honour its decisions, rules, regulations,"
"directives, policies of the Party as decided by the High Command. But the Petitioner has not"
"only  breached  this  solemn  pledge  but  also  has  deliberately  refrained  from  giving  any"
"explanation for his conduct. He has also determined not to submit himself to the authority of"
"the Party. In those circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, I hold that the decision made"
"by the SLMC to expel the Petitioner from the party by letter P15 dated 23.04.2022, is valid in"
"law."
"I proceed to dismiss this Petition."
