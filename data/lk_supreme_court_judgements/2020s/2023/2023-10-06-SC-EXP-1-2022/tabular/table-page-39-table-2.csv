"sufficient to state their case and the manner in which they did so, had a direct bearing on the"
"further question whether Natural Justice required an oral hearing and additional evidence to"
"be placed in that case, proceeded to hold as follows:"
"“Those were cases of re-hearing by the same authority. The principle that a failure"
"o
f
 Natural Justice at the original hearing may sometimes be cured by a ""full re-"
"hearing"" by another body was recognised by the Privy council in Pillai v. Singapore"
"C

"proceedings cured the defect. Although they were by way of “appeal”, those"
"proceedings were in the nature of a re-hearing and evidence was called de nova."
"This was followed in Stringer v. Minister of Housing. In Calvin v Carr, the Privy"
"Council dealing with an appeal from New South Wales, recognised that there was"
"no absolute rule, either way, as to whether defects in Natural Justice at an original"
"hearing can be cured through proceedings by way of appeal or re-hearing (at pp."
"447-448); everything depends on whether after “examination of the hearing"
"process, original and appeal as a whole"", the Court is satisfied that ""there has been"
"a

result, reached by fair methods""; whether “the appellant's case has received,"
"overall, full and fair consideration"", (pp. 448, 449, 452)."

"order of expulsion, and the fact that the Petitioners participated in the subsequent"
"proceedings gave the Working Committee a locus poenitentiae; (c) the allegations"
"were fairly and adequately, though not fully and precisely, communicated; and (d)"
