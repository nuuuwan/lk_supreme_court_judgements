"the  road  and  journey  on  foot  and/or  resort  to  alternate  means  of  transportation."
"Furthermore, the vehicle could not be parked on either side of the road due to the fact"
"that several vehicles had already been parked therein. The Plaintiff stated to Court that,"
"on  previous  occasions,  his  appearances  at  Court  were  punctual,  having 
left  his"
"residence at the same time as he did on 16th January 2012. His contention was that the"
"delay was not his fault and instead beyond his control."
"The evidence of one Karagapalliya Guruge Udayananda (a three-wheeler driver who"
"operates from a three-wheeler stand opposite the Narahenpita Police Station) and one"
"Kalutara Patabandige Patrick Anesley Peiris (a resident of a road which leads to Kirula"
"Road) was led thereafter. These witnesses corroborated the evidence of the  Plaintiff,"
"and  in  particular,  stated  that  on  16th  January  2012,  the  new  building  housing  the"
"Narahenpita Police Station was being ceremoniously opened, and a major congestion"
"of  traffic  occurred  between  8.00  A.M.  and  10.30  A.M.  While  the  Narahenpita  police"
"station has two gates, on that specific date, it was only the gate alongside Kirula Road"
"that was in use.  The said Kirula Road is an ordinary by-road where, in the event two"
"vehicles are parked, it would be difficult to manoeuvre another. On the said date, senior"
"police  officials  and  VIPs  had  parked  their  vehicles  on  Kirula  Road,  which  made  it"
"impossible for the residents and users, including the said Udayananda, to move their"
"vehicles. A photo showing the road was marked 2D3 (at page 368 of the appeal brief)."
"All witnesses claim that on the said date, the police did not allow the residents to move"
"their vehicles out or in that morning."
"The  2nd  Defendant 
led  evidence  of  Police 
Inspector  Weerasinghelage  Wasantha"
"Jayaratne.  The  witness  confirmed 
the 
fact 
that 
the  ceremonial  opening  of 
the"
"Narahenpita  Police  Station  took  place  on  16th  January  2012  and  that  a  number  of"
"distinguished 
invitees  were  present, 
including  Mr.  Dinesh  Gunawardene,  Mr."
"Geethanjan Gunawardene, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapakse and the Inspector General of Police."
"There was no road closure during the time at which VIPs were travelling towards the"
"ceremony, but, from time to time, roads were indeed closed, coinciding with the arrival"
