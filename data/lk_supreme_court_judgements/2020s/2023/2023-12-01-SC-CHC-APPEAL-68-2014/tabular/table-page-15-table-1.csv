"on behalf of the Plaintiff in my view is that an application was filed on the same day"
"for an appeal to set aside the order dismissing his application, which indicates that it"
"was due to a misfortune beyond his control that he was not able to arrive on time and"
"that  he  did  yet  maintain  an  interest  in  this  action.  Therefore,  the  view  taken  by  the"
"learned  High  Court  Judge  to  consider  this  matter  under  section  87  of  the  Civil"
"Procedure Code and in giving an order in terms of section 87(3) of the Civil Procedure"
"Code setting aside the dismissal of the action of the Plaintiff is acceptable. The Appeal"
"of the 2nd Defendant is hereby dismissed with taxed Costs."
"Appeal Dismissed."
