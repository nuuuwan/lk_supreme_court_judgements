"High Court, it was undisputed that on the date in question, the opening ceremony of"
"the Narahenpita Police Station took place. From the strength of the evidence of the"
"Plaintiff,  it  is  proven  that  on  the  date  in  question,  a  considerable  amount  of  traffic"
"congestion was present in the Plaintiff’s Lane, and the reason for such congestion was"
"the fact that an unforeseen number of vehicles had been directed into the Plaintiff's"
"lane. The position of the  Plaintiff was  corroborated, by other independent evidence"
"produced before the Court."
"As it was revealed, during the opening ceremony of the police station, no traffic plan"
"was  in  place.  However,  evidence  was  given  by  Police  Inspector  Weerasinghelage"
"Wasantha Jayaratne to the effect that he did not personally know the situation in the"
"Plaintiff’s Lane as this officer was not on duty at that point. Although certain dignitaries’"
"vehicles were parked within the premises of the police station, certain other dignitaries’"
"vehicles  (particularly  the  high-ranking  police  official’s  vehicles)  had  to  be  parked"
"outside of the police station. As a result, the vehicles that were normally parked at this"
"location had to find alternative areas to park. The witness was unable to account for"
"where these vehicles had found parking. Therefore, it can be considered that vehicles"
"that normally park in other areas surrounding the Plaintiff’s Road, had parked down"
"the  road  instead,  leading  to  a  heightened  congestion  of  vehicles.    As  such,  the"
"Plaintiff’s reasons for being unable to be present before Court at the designated time"
"could be accepted on a balance of probabilities."
