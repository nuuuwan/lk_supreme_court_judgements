********* ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Added-Respondent, one Selvarasa Selvarooban, was named

and added as a party to the instant appeal by the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants by way of an amended petition tendered to this Court,

supported by an affidavit along with an amended caption. This

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

4

amendment was made by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants only

after this Court had granted leave on their original petition. Upon being

noticed by this Court, the Added -Respondent was represented by the

learned Presidents Counsel, who then moved his client be discharged

from these proceedings. In his submissions, learned Presidents Counsel

took up the position that the Added-Respondent was neither a party to

the action before the original Court instituted by the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants, nor to the proceedings before the Civil

Appellate High Court holden in Jaffna, initiated by the Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondent, in invoking its revisionary jurisdiction. In these

circumstances, it was contended by the Counsel that the Added-

Respondent is not bound by either of the two Judgments referred to in

the instant appeal. The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants have resisted

the said application.

The three Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants have instituted the

instant action in 2012, before the District Court of Mallakam, regarding a

dispute over the ownership of a passenger bus bearing number NPNA

0226. In their prayer to the Plaint, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants

have sought a declaration against the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent,

who was the registered owner of the said passenger bus at that point of

time, that the said passenger bus is held by him in trust and benefit of

the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants. They also sought the following

reliefs in their prayer to the Plaint: -

i. an order of Court on the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent

to consent the Route Permit in favour of the 2nd Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellant,

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

5

ii. an order of Court to handover the said passenger bus

immediately to the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants, and

also

iii. an order restraining him from selling, transferring,

mortgaging the bus.

It was averred in the plaint of the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants that the said passenger bus was purchased from the funds

supplied by the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent- Appellant. The 2nd and 3rd

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants are husband and wife respectively.

The Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent is the father of the 3rd Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellant and a sibling of the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellant. On the request of the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants, the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant, who now resides in

Canada, had provided a sum of Rs. 3.5 Million on 18.03.2010, to proceed

with the purchase of the disputed passenger bus. After the purchase, it

was registered in the name of the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent

allegedly in trust. He had obtained a route permit in his name from

the National Transport Commission to transport passengers between

Kilinochchi and Mulangavil in that bus, while the 2nd Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellant functioned as its driver.

When the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant demanded a sum of

Rs. 2 Million from the capital he had provided to purchase the said

passenger bus at a subsequent point of time, it is claimed by the 2nd and

3rd Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants that they have secured a loan from

the Commercial Leasing Company, in January 2011 with a view to pay

back to the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant. They also claimed that

since then, they themselves paid the monthly instalment of Rs. 60,000.00

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

6

to the said Leasing Company. In June 2011, a dispute arose between the

2nd and 3rd Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants and the Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondent over a payment and the route permit of the

passenger bus was cancelled by the authorities. The Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants also alleged that the said cancellation was done

by the authorities on the instigation of the Defendant-Petitioner-

Respondent, and the said cancellation had resulted in depriving them of

any income from plying passengers, on which they relied on to service

the said loan instalment. After making a complaint to Kilinochchi Police

in this regard, the disputing parties were directed to the Mediation

Board. Since there was no settlement of the dispute, the instant action

was instituted by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants as the

Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent had kept the bus at an undisclosed

location and they feared that the latter might transfer the ownership of

the disputed passenger bus to a third party.

In his answer, the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent had denied

the claim of a trust and averred that it was on his request that the 1st

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant sent a sum of Rs. 3 Million to a relative

in Puttlam as a loan to purchase the passenger bus. He further alleged

that it is upon the failure of the 2nd and 3rd Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants to repay the loan from the income derived from the bus, the

1st Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant requested him to take possession of

same and sell it, in order to recover the capital. The Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondent had thereupon pledged the vehicle to the

Commercial Leasing Company and obtained a sum of Rs. 2 Million,

which he deposited in the account of a relative, who was named by the

1st Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant, by way of a part settlement of the

said loan of Rs. 3 Million and he himself had paid several instalments.

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

7

The Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent further alleged that the disputed

passenger bus had been kept at an undisclosed location by the 2nd

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant and a police complaint was lodged. The

bus was later recovered by the Police, concealed in a remote area

bordering a forest in Achchipuram, Vavunia.

The parties proceeded to trial and presented evidence with no

trial issues settled between them. At the conclusion of the trial, the

learned District Judge, after fixing the date for the Judgment, noted that

there were no issues settled between the parties. The trial Court had

thereafter delivered its Judgment on 10.03.2016, after parties have

agreed on the trial issues at that late stage. The Judgment was delivered

in favour of the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants and the Court granted

the declaration that the said passenger bus is held by the Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondent in trust and directed him to consent for the

transfer of Route Permit. The Court also ordered the Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondent to hand over the disputed passenger bus to the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants.

The Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent did not prefer an appeal

against the said Judgment, instead he had opted to invoke revisionary

jurisdiction of the Civil Appellate High Court in Jaffna, by filing

application No. Revision/65/2016, on 23.05.2016. The Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants have resisted the said revision application, and

the appellate Court, after an inquiry had delivered its order on

12.10.2016 setting aside the Judgment of the District Court. The

interference to the Judgment of the trial Court by the appellate Court

was made on the basis that the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants have

averred in their Plaint of a repayment of Rs. 2 Million made by the

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

8

Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent to the 1st Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellant and therefore the disputed vehicle is not a trust property. The

appellate Court also ruled that since the Defendant-Petitioner-

Respondent had mortgaged the passenger bus to the Commercial

Leasing Company, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants should have

added that Company as a necessary party to their action. However,

there was no attempt made by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants to

name that party to the proceedings before this Court.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants have thereafter sought

Leave to Appeal from this Court against the said order of the Civil

Appellate High Court, by way of a petition and affidavit tendered to the

Registry on 24.11.2016. This Court, having heard the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants as well as the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent

on 05.10.2018, had decided to grant Leave to Appeal to the questions of

Law, as set out in paragraphs 39(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of the said Petition,

which have been formulated mainly on the existence of a trust. The

determination on these several questions of Law will have to be made

only after hearing the parties on them at a subsequent stage and at this

point of time, this Court concerns itself only with the application of the

Added-Respondent.

The reason attributed by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants, in

adding the Added-Respondent to these proceedings, was provided by

way of a motion tendered to this Court for the first time on 11.10.2017. It

was stated therein that the Added-Respondent, being the current owner

of the bus, should be added as a party. They sought permission to

amend the petition and as well as its caption and also moved to bring

the fraudulent act committed by the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

9

to the notice of this Court, in transferring his ownership to the Added-

Respondent, pending appeal. They also claimed in the said motion that

if the present owner is not added as a Respondent, an irremediable loss

would be caused to them, as instituting a fresh action against the said

Added-Respondent is not feasible.

It is only on 11.10.2017, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants have

brought the fact of transferring the ownership of the disputed

passenger bus by the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent to the Added-

Respondent to the notice of this Court for the first time, and that too by

way of a motion. In the said motion, the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants alleged that the ownership of the passenger bus had been

transferred in favour of Selvarasa Selvarooban by the Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondent on 25.11.2016 and therefore sought permission of

Court to add him as a necessary party to the appeal, in order to

effectually and completely adjudicate the dispute. The application of the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants was repeated in the 2nd motion filed on

03.05.2018, filing of which apparently was necessitated as the 1st motion

was misplaced. The 3rd motion by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants

was also on the same lines. It had been tendered to Court on 10.10.2018.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants, for the fourth time filed a similar

motion dated 26.11.2018, and this time, in addition to the motion, they

have tendered an amended petition and an affidavit, along with an

amended caption with the said Selvarasa Selvarooban named therein as

an Added-Respondent, in relation to their appeal.

This Court, having heard submissions of the learned Counsel for

the Plaintiff- Respondent-Appellants in support of her said 4th motion

and, in the absence of any objections by the Defendant-Petitioner-

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

10

Respondent, had issued notice on the Added-Respondent, upon

acceptance of the said amended petition and caption. The Added-

Respondent was represented by his Counsel on the notice returnable

date i.e. 22.05.2019. He resisted being added as a party to the instant

appeal and sought to discharge him from the proceedings. The inquiry

on the application of the Added-Respondent seeking to discharge

himself was taken up by this Court on 22.02.2022.

It was contended on behalf of the Added-Respondent by the

learned Presidents Counsel that Selvarasa Selvarooban is not a party to

the action before the District Court or to the proceedings before the

Civil Appellate High Court and hence he had not been heard by any of

the Courts below. It was also contended that, in the absence of a

provision enabling an addition of a party during pendency of an

appeal, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants have no legal basis to add

the Added-Respondent as a party at this late stage of the proceedings.

The Learned Presidents Counsel relied on the reasoning of the

Judgment of Fernando v De Silva & Others (2000) 3 Sri L.R. 29, in

support of his contention that even at the stage of execution of a decree

of the original Court, an application to add a party would not be

entertained.

In her reply, learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants had submitted that her clients have lost their only source of

income derived by plying passengers for the last five years, primarily

due to fraudulent act of the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent and

therefore if the Added-Respondent is not made a party to the instant

appeal, the purpose of seeking a determination of their appeal by this

Court would be rendered futile. She alleged that the Defendant-

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

11

Petitioner-Respondent did not execute decree in the original Court and

did not even make an application to this Court for writ pending appeal

in his failure to deposit of cost. As such, it was contended that the

Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent is in clear violation of the applicable

procedural Laws and guilty of abuse of process to the extent of

committing contempt of Court. She had cited a long string of judicial

precedents as found in Sarkar on Code of Civil Procedure, 12th Ed,

which dealt with judicial decisions that were pronounced in relation to

addition of parties in that jurisdiction and particularly invited our

attention to the following text, which states (at p. 306):

Where it is shown that the original relief claimed

has, by reason of subsequent change of circumstances,

become inappropriate or that it is necessary to base the

decision of the Court on the later circumstances in

order to shorten litigation or to do complete justice

between the parties , it is incumbent on the Court to

take notice of events which have happened since the

institution of the suit and to mold its decree according

to the circumstances as they stand at the time the

decree is made.

She also invited this Court to exercise its inherent powers, citing

Sarkar, where it is stated (at p. 900) section 151 of the Civil Procedure

Code is an enabling provision by virtue of which inherent powers have been

vested with the Court not to feel helpless in such circumstances. But to

administer substantial justice, Court can use its own inherent power to fill up

the lacunae left by the legislature while enacting law or where the Legislature

is unable to foresee any circumstances which may arise in a particular case.

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

12

In view of the above contentions, I shall now proceed to consider

the application of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Added-

Respondent.

Admittedly the Added-Respondent is named as a party for the

first-time pending determination of the appeal of the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants and after leave was granted. He was not a party

to the litigation before the District Court nor to the proceedings held

before the Civil Appellate High Court, as correctly highlighted by the

learned Presidents Counsel.

The submissions of the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants, in resisting the application of the Added-

Respondent, was primarily presented on the principles that are

embodied in the statutory provisions contained in section 18 of the Civil

Procedure Code. Of the several local judicial precedents that were

referred to in her submissions, I find that all of them have been decided

on the principles of Law that contain in the said statutory provision.

The long list of quotations cited from Sarkar too relates to a similar

statutory provision that govern the procedure of addition of parties

before the original Courts, in the neighbouring jurisdiction of India.

Of course, the relevant statutory provision that provided for

addition of a party to a civil dispute, pending adjudication before the

District Court, is found in section 18 of our Civil Procedure Code.

Purpose of such an addition of a party, as stated in the section, is to

enable the Court to effectually and completely adjudicate upon all the

questions involved in that action. A considerable body of judicial

precedents that is available on this topic indicate that the superior

Courts have considered the statutory provisions contained in the said

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

13

section in a multitude of factual situations and had laid down

applicable principles that govern the discretion of a Court, when such

an application is made. The oft quoted Judgment of this Court,

Arumugam Coomaraswamy v Andiris Appuhamy and Others (1985) 2

Sri L.R. 219, where Ranasinghe J (as he was then) favoured the wider

construction of the statutory provisions of the applicable Law, in

addition of parties. But the application of these principles is limited to

addition of parties in the original Courts and that too before the

Judgment is pronounced.

The Judgment of Fernando v De Silva & Others (2000) 3 Sri L.R.

29 considered the objection raised by an added respondent Company,

when it was named as a party to the appeal by the Plaintiff. The appeal

was preferred by the plaintiff in seeking to challenge the trial Courts

decision, by which it had refused to add the said respondent Company

as an added party at the stage of execution of writ. In delivering the

judgment, de Z Gunawardene J stated (at p. 32) that no one can be

added as a party to the action after Judgment had been entered, one way or the

other. Nothing more need be said in regard to this question as it is so well

known. A similar view was taken in the Judgment of Ameen v

Salahudeen & Others (1998) 3 Sri L.R. 185, where Wigneswaran J had

determined the validity of an order made under section 18 by the

District Court, in which an outsider was admitted as an intervenient

party, after the said Court had entered its decree. His Lordship,

following the ratio of the judgments of Cooray v Gaffar (CA 92/80

DC Panadura (552) CAM 18.2.1983), Pitisinghe v. Ratnaweera 62 NLR

572, Norris v. Charles 63 NLR 510 and Richford Trading Company v.

The Miyanawita Estates Co., Ltd. and another (CA 790/84 DC

Colombo 47303RE - CAM 13.9.1985) stated (at p. 190) allowing the

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

14

addition of the petitioner-respondent as a necessary party after decree was

entered, was ex facie bad in law and therefore set it aside and declare void all

steps taken by Court based on that order as from the time of such order.

It is relevant to note that the Added-Respondent was added as a

party by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants not at the time filing of

the application in this Court seeking Leave to Appeal, but at the hearing

stage of the appeal of the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants, and even

after the question of granting of leave was decided. The Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants, in seeking Leave to Appeal against the

Judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court, have invoked the

provisions of section 5C (1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006, which enables a party to

appeal to this Court directly against any Judgment, decree or order

pronounced or entered by a High Court, in the exercise of its

jurisdiction granted by section 5A of the said Act.

Once its jurisdiction is invoked, proceedings before this Court are

governed by the procedure as set out in the Rules of the Supreme Court

1990. In setting out the procedure in which a party could seek Special

Leave as well as Leave to Appeal from this Court, both Rules 4 and

25(8) impose a mandatory requirement by insisting on the requirement

that all parties in whose favour the Judgment or order complained against

was delivered, or adversely to whom such appeal is preferred shall be named

as respondents.

It appears from the wording of both these Rules that naming of

respondents should be made at the time of lodgment of such an

application, notice of appeal or the petition of appeal, as the case may

be. Rule 4 refers to every such application, indicating that it relates to

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

15

applications seeking Special Leave to Appeal as contemplated by Rule

No. 2, while Rule 28(5) also indicates that every such petition of appeal

and notice of appeal and thus relates to the appeals and notices of appeal

as referred to in Rule 28(2). In my view, both these Rules, in addition to

imposing a requirement of naming of all parties in whose favour the

Judgment or order complained against was delivered, or adversely to whom

such appeal is preferred as respondents at the time of invocation of

appellate jurisdiction of this Court, have also included another

description of respondents, when it stated that such appeal or

application shall also name parties whose interest may be adversely

affected by the success of the appeal.

This Court in the Judgment of Ibrahim v Nadarajah (1991) 1 Sri

L.R. 131, held that It has always, therefore, been the law that it is necessary

for the proper constitution of an appeal that all parties who may be adversely

affected by the result of the appeal should be made parties and, unless they are,

the petition of appeal should be rejected. This was an instance where the

appellant had failed to name a party to the proceedings before lower

Court as a respondent in the appellate proceedings before this Court. It

should be noted that Amerasinghe J had used the description all parties

who may be adversely affected by the result of the appeal whereas the Rules

refer to the description of such a party whose interest may be adversely

affected by the success of the appeal. In view of this description, it is

doubtful whether the Added-Respondent could be termed as such a

party.

The said pronouncement by Amerasinghe J was re-affirmed in

Senanayake v Attorney General & Another (2010) 1 Sri L.R. 149 as it

was stated by Bandaranayake J (as she then was) that In terms of the

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

16

Supreme Court Rules, for the purpose of proper constitution of an appeal, it is

vital that all parties, who may be adversely affected by the result of the appeal

should be made parties. Thus, the said pronouncement implies that the

party who may be adversely affected by the result of the appeal, should

be named as a party to the proceedings before this Court, at the stage of

invocation of its appellate jurisdiction. In Senanayake v Attorney

General & Another (ibid), this Court held that the Appellant had failed

to name the Director-General of the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery and Corruption, who is a necessary party to the

appeal, since it was he who had instituted proceedings in the original

Court as the complainant. The Court then proceeded to dismiss the said

appeal for non-compliance of the Supreme Court Rules.

In the instant appeal, as already noted, the addition was made by

the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants while their appeal was pending

before this Court, and after a determination of their rights was made by

the High Court of Civil Appeal in the exercise of its revisionary

jurisdiction. It is also noted that there is no express provision of Law or

a Rule which enables an applicant or an appellant to name a total

stranger as a party, particularly in mid-stream of the appellate

proceedings that are already instituted and continuing before this

Court. The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants have sought to justify their

action of naming a party in mid-stream by advancing the contention

that, in the absence of a specific provision of Law that prohibits

addition of parties pending appeal before this Court, it should not

refuse to make the proposed addition of a party necessary in order to

facilitate a complete adjudication of the dispute presented before the

District Court.

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

17

A similar contention was advanced before this Court by Counsel

in Ramasamy v Soundarajan & Others (SC Appeal No. 199/17

decided on 24.02.2022) to defend the decision of the Civil Appellate

High Court in Kandy, allowing an intervention of a party during

appellate proceedings before that Court. Rejecting the said contention,

Amarasekera J stated in view of the statutory provisions contained in

section 18 of the Civil Procedure Code, it must be stated here that what is

expressly stated excluded others.

In relation to the instant appeal, it is relevant to note that in the

absence of a direct appeal that had been preferred by the Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondent there was no continuation of the litigation

process that had proceeded before the District Court beyond the

delivery of the Judgment by that Court in favour of the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants. Instead, he had opted to invoke supervisory

jurisdiction conferred on the High Court of Civil Appeal seeking its

intervention to set aside that Judgment. In these circumstances, the

continuality of the process of litigation was interrupted. Thereupon,

with the invocation of revisionary jurisdiction, it had assumed the

character of different process of litigation between the parties named

therein. The revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court of Civil Appeal

is a discretionary remedy as opposed to a right to appeal and there

must be exceptional circumstances, in order to trigger in the process of

supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court of Civil Appeal. Thus, in

such circumstances the question of addition of parties to the original

action does not arise and the statutory provisions, namely section 18 of

the Civil Procedure Code, as referred to by the learned Counsel for the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants on that point does not provide any

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

18

assistance to the determination of the contentious issue raised before

this Court.

Even the question is whether the added party as a necessary

party to the revision application filed before the High Court of Civil

Appeal, the outcome of which is now being challenged in the instant

appeal should be answered in the negative since the complaint of the

illegality and the irregularity of the Judgment of the original Court by

the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent had nothing to do with the

Added-Respondent and therefore he is not a necessary party to be

named in the said revision application. This is because as far as the

Judgment of this Court (which will have to be pronounced only after

hearing the appeal) is concerned the Added -Respondent cannot be

considered as a party in whose favour the Judgment or order

complained against was delivered, or adversely to whom such appeal is

preferred.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants, in fact made no endeavour

to justify their naming of the Added-Respondent in mid-stream in the

instant appeal by referring to any statutory provision of Law or a Rule.

They also made no endeavour to impress this Court that the addition of

the Added-Respondent was necessary because he qualifies to be treated

as a party whose interest may be adversely affected by the success of the

appeal. Instead, the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants had chosen to harp on the complaint that if the Added-

Respondent is not added, even if their appeal ended up in success, it is

their interests that would be adversely affected and not that of the

Added-Respondent.

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

19

It was already noted that the learned Presidents Counsels

contention is that the Added-Respondent was not a party to the

proceedings before the District Court and the Civil Appellate High

Court. The Added-Respondent had acquired ownership to the disputed

passenger bus from its duly registered owner, the Defendant-Petitioner-

Respondent, who had a Judgment of an appellate Court in his favour at

that point of time. There was no prohibition, lien, caveat, or stay order

preventing the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent to transfer ownership

of that bus, he held in his name. This particular transaction had taken

place on 25.11.2016. The delivery of the Judgment of the Civil Appellate

High Court was made on 12.10.2016. The Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants have sought leave from this Court against the said

Judgment by their petition dated 21.11.2016 and this Court issued notice

on the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent, that the said application is

listed for support on 13.02.2017.

The said Notice was dispatched to the Defendant-Petitioner-

Respondent on 28.11.2016 informing that the matter is listed for support

on 13.02.2017. By then, the said transfer of the ownership of the

disputed passenger bus in favour of the Added-Respondent had

already been completed. Since, this transfer had taken place on

25.11.2016, it is doubtful whether the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent

was aware of the fact that the instant application was pending before

this Court before making the said transfer. Thus, I am unable to accept

the claim that there had been an abuse of process by the Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondent. It also must be noted that the previous owner of

the said passenger bus, as per the Certificate of Registration (X), was

Commercial Leasing and Finance PLC and not the Defendant-

Petitioner-Respondent. There was no explanation as to this change of

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

20

ownership from the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent to that

Company. However, the explanation for the delayed inclusion of the

said Added-Respondent to the instant proceedings by the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants is that they learnt about this transfer only

around June 2017 and therefore have not reasonably foreseen such a

turn of events. This claim cannot be accepted. In their Plaint filed before

the District Court, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants averred that

there are possibilities of transferring the bus to another person by the

Defendant-Petitioner- Respondent. This averment clearly indicates that

the Plaintiff- Respondent-Appellants had already foreseen the adoption

of such a course of action by the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent

when they instituted the original action and in fact they prayed for, in

the interim, an order of Court to prevent such a transfer taking place.

This is not a situation in which the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants had failed to name a necessary party to the action they

instituted against the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent or to have

failed to add the Added-Respondent as a party, in compliance of

section 18 of the Civil Procedure Code, before the trial Court

pronounced its Judgment. The inclusion of Added-Respondent as a

party in mid-stream of the appeal proceedings in this Court is a direct

consequence of him acquiring ownership of the passenger bus, over

which the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants and the Defendant-

Petitioner- Respondent are currently engaged in a process of litigation

that had reached its final phase. It is settled Law that the rights of the

parties are decided as at the date of action. When the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants instituted action, the registered owner was the

Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent and he is bound by the Judgment

delivered against him by the trial Court, until it was set aside by the

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

21

Civil Appellate High Court. The entitlement of the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants will finally be decided by this Court after

hearing of their appeal, where the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent is

a party.

The inherent powers of a Court should not be used to deny the

Added Respondents right to defend against allegation of fraud made

by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants before an original Court, as the

allegation of fraud is based on facts and the former had no opportunity

to challenge such allegations and to place his side of the narration. If the

actions of the Added-Respondent are violative of the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants rights, they could sue the former on that cause

of action.

In the absence of any specific Rule in the Supreme Court Rules as

to make an addition of a party in mid-stream of appellate proceedings

before this Court, a question necessarily arises whether cannot this

Court hear a party, who is not originally a party to the proceedings,

under any circumstances, even if it is of the view that such a party

should be afforded an opportunity to be heard.

The judgment of Bandaranaike v Jagathsena & Others (1984) 2

Sri L.R. 397, is an instance where this Court, in addition to dealing with

several other important areas of Law, also dealt with a situation where a

party, who was originally not a party to the appellate proceedings

before the Court of Appeal but was subsequently allowed to intervene

into and had sought leave to appeal from this Court against the

Judgment of that Court. A preliminary objection was raised before this

Court challenging the petitioners locus standi to seek review of the

Judgment of the Court of Appeal on the basis that she was neither an

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

22

appellant nor a respondent to the appellate proceedings. Colin-Thome J,

rejecting the said preliminary objection stated thus (at p. 406);

Under Article 128 (2) the Supreme Court has a wide

discretion to grant special leave to appeal to the Supreme

Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal where in the

opinion of the Supreme Court, the case or matter is fit for

review by the Supreme Court. Under Article 128 (2) you do

not have to be a party in the original case.

His Lordship further stated that his view is strengthened on an

examination of Article 134 (2) and (3) of the Constitution, as Article

134(2) provides that The Supreme Court may in its discretion grant to any

other person or his legal representative such hearing as may appear to the Court

to be necessary in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Chapter. Thus, a

discretion is conferred upon this Court by Article 134(3), enabling it to

hear any party if it appear to the Court to be necessary in the exercise of its

jurisdiction under this Chapter. But in relation to the instant matter, I am

not inclined use that discretion to prejudice the rights of the Added-

Respondent by adding him as a party at this stage of the proceedings

and thereby denying him of an opportunity to place evidence before the

original Court and also to cross-examine the opposite party in relation

to his defenses that could be taken by him, as contemplated in sections

65, 66, 68 and 98 of the Trusts Ordinance.

Admittedly the primary reason for the addition of the Added-

Respondent was due to the fact of him becoming the registered owner

of the disputed passenger bus. At first glance, the reason to add the

Added-Respondent could be justified since the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Appellants had no hand in the said transfer and it was done without

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

23

their knowledge. They also claim that such a transfer was not foreseen

by them.

But if one were to inquire into the relevant attendant

circumstances, one cannot help but to note that it is the lackadaisical

approach of the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants that had mainly

contributed to the present state of affairs, in which the addition of the

Added-Respondent was moved for, in order to have the current owner

of the passenger bus added as a party. I have already referred to the

fact that this eventuality had already been foreseen by the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants at the time of institution of their action but did

nothing to secure their rights after the trial Court pronounced its

Judgment in their favour.

In their Plaint, they have averred their apprehension of the

Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent transferring ownership of the

disputed passenger bus to a third party. Perhaps, it is in view of this

apprehension, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants have sought for an

order of Court on the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent to immediately

hand over the said vehicle to them. After trial, the District Court of

Mallakam, by its judgment dated 10.03.2016, had granted that very relief.

The Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent had moved the Civil

Appellate High Court holden in Jaffna seeking to set aside the said

Judgment not by invoking its appellate jurisdiction but by invoking

revisionary jurisdiction and tendered his petition to the appellate Court

on 23.05.2016. The application was supported on 14.06.2016 and only on

that day the appellate Court had made order staying further

proceedings before the trial Court. In the absence of a Notice of Appeal

that had been tendered within the stipulated time period, there was

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

24

sufficient time for the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants to seek

execution of the Judgment, which granted them the substantial relief

and particularly the custody of the passenger bus. If there was realistic

threat of transferring the trust property to a third party, it is reasonable

to expect the Judgment Creditor to move Court for the issuance of Writ

of Execution. But the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants, having had a

Judgment in their favour in an action in which they themselves

specifically sought delivery of property, did not take any steps to

execute Decree, even in the absence of any indication to appellate

jurisdiction being invoked by the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent.

Strangely, the learned Counsel who represented the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants before this Court alleged that it was the

Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent who had failed to execute the Writ.

She did not elaborate as to how the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent

could move Court to execute the Writ, that had been issued under the

Judgment and Decree against him.

The order of the Civil Appellate High Court was delivered on

12.10.2016, on the said revision application by the Defendant-Petitioner-

Respondent, and thereby the appellate Court had set aside the

Judgment of the trial Court. The Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants in

addition to seeking Leave to Appeal from this Court, also sought

interim relief by way of staying all proceedings relating to the decree in

terms of the Judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court. After the

relevant proceedings were translated into English, the Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants supported their application on 05.10.2018 and

this Court had granted Leave on four questions of Law. But the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants have not pursued with their

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

25

application for interim relief at that point of time and appears to have

abandoned their claim on interim relief.

In relation to the instant appeal, it must be observed that this is

not a situation where the Added-Respondent sought intervention into

the appellate proceedings before this Court as a party for the first time

under provisions of Article 134(3) seeking to exercise discretion of Court

that he be heard. In fact, he resists the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants

act of naming him as an Added-Respondent to the proceedings before

this Court.

Thus, it would appear from the considerations referred to in the

preceding paragraphs that the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants, despite

entertaining an apprehension that the Defendant-Petitioner-Respondent

would transfer ownership of the disputed passenger bus to a third

party, they did not diligently pursue available legal remedies to prevent

such a transfer taking place. The Added-Respondent clearly is not a

party to the action before the District Court or to the proceedings before

the Civil Appellate High Court and therefore not bound by any of the

two Judgments. In the circumstances, I am of the view that the Added-

Respondent is not a party whose interests may be adversely affected by the

success of the appeal as he himself asserts and therefore need not be

heard in determining the instant appeal. In the circumstances, having

asked the question whether it is necessary to hear the Added-

Respondent, as Samarakoon CJ did in Bandaranaike v Jagathsena &

Others (supra), I would answer same in the negative.

In view of the reasoning enumerated above, the application of the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Added-Respondent seeking to

discharge him from these proceedings should succeed. Therefore, the

S.C. Appeal No. 148/2018

26

Added-Respondent is discharged forthwith from these proceedings

and, if they so whish, the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellants may

prosecute their appeal, on the Questions of Law that had already been

formulated by this Court.

The application of the Added-Respondent is accordingly allowed,

and he is discharged forthwith from these proceedings. The Plaintiff-

Respondent-Appellants are directed to tender an amended caption in

terms of this order along with necessary amendments to the amended

petition dated 26.11.2018 within a period of four weeks from the

pronouncement of this order.

I make no order as to costs.
