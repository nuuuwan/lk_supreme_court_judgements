Judgement

Aluwihare, PC, J.,

In this matter, the court granted leave to proceed for the alleged violation of the

Petitioners fundamental right enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution. In

addition to a declaration that the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under

the said Article had been violated by the Respondents, Petitioners also sought by

way of further relief, that the letter issued by the Chairman Land Reform

Commission dated 22nd April 2013[X5] be declared null and void and to quash

the letter dated 29.04.2013, issued by the Director of the District Land Reform

Board (Nuwara Eliya) [X7].

Background facts

The Petitioner contends that the Petitioner is the lawful owner of two parcels of

land called Madalanda Estate and Keenagaskebella.

On 22nd April 2013, the Chairman of the Land Reform Commission, the 1st

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the LRC), by way of a letter (marked and

produced as X5) requested Deshamanya Siva Obeyesekere to handover several

lands to the LRC. Listed among the properties were Medalanda Estate in the

Colombo District [listed under c] and Keenagaskebella in Nuwara-Eliya [listed

under e]. The ownership of these two lands, however, had been transferred to the

Petitioner [Maligawa Tours and Export (PVT) Ltd] way back in 1982 and 1972

respectively. In the case of the land Keenagaskebella, the transfer had been made

more than 41 years before the letter X5. It was submitted that the Petitioner has

enjoyed both the ownership, and possession and further, utilised the two properties

for various purposes since. It was revealed that, prior to receiving the letter X5,

Deshamanya Siva Obeyesekere also had received several letters relating to some of

her other properties, from the LRC, and had tendered an appeal to the 2nd

Respondent [Director, District Land Reform Board, Nuwara-Eliya]. This letter of

appeal (marked X6) had been copied to the then Legal Consultant for the LRC,

Mahanama Thilekaratne.

Having been made aware of the attempts to take over the said properties, Chantal

Obeyesekere (daughter of Deshamanya Siva Obeyesekere and as well as a Director

of the Petitioner company) had met with Mahanama Thilekaratne to inquire about

the matter and voice its grievance over the attempted takeover of lands which were

lawfully conveyed over 30 years before. When the file pertaining to the lands was

called for, it was observed that the file (bearing No. 2293) bore the endorsement

file closed. Having been apprised of the situation, Mahanama Thilekaratne had

made an endorsement and directed the conduct of an inquiry. The letter marked

X6 contains the hand-written endorsement and directions dated 03.04.2013; and

reads thus: I have studied the files pertaining to this and the Director has no right

or authority to intimidate persons like this. I recommend to have a full inquiry into

4

this matter. Inform the Director not to take any action until the most essential

inquiry is over.

Despite the directions of the legal Consultant Tillakaratne made on the 3rd April

2013, no inquiry was conducted, X5 was issued on the 22nd April (when for the

first time the lands Medalanda and Keenagaskebella was included) and on the

29th April 2013, the 2nd Respondent informed Deshamanya Siva Obeyesekere by

letter (marked X7) that she is required to handover the said lands, failing which,

the lands will be taken over. Thereafter, fearing an imminent infringement of its

Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 12(1), the Petitioner invoked the

jurisdiction of this court. When this matter was supported on 7th September 2022,

this Court, in addition to granting leave to proceed as referred to earlier, granted

Interim relief, prohibiting the Respondents from taking any further action in

pursuance of re-possessing the lands which form the subject of the dispute, as

directed by the letter dated 29th April 2013 (X7). What follows is a narration of

the facts in detail, as they relate to each property.

The two parcels of land

(i) The Medalanda Estate

The Medalanda Estate, more fully described in Plan No. 5453/L.R.C. CO

2317 dated 20th January 1980 was vested in the 1st Respondent by the

operation of the Land Reform Law. Thereafter, the LRC [the 1st Respondent]

transferred the estate to Chantal Hiranthi Obeyesekere (daughter of Mr. J.P.

Obeysekera) by Deed bearing No. 5619 dated 6th October 1982. [X2(a)] This

transfer was done for the purpose of agriculture or animal husbandry by

and under virtue of Section 22(1)(a) of the Land Reform Law. Subsequently,

the Petitioner company obtained ownership of the estate when Chantal

Hiranthi Obeyesekere transferred ownership to the Petitioner company by

way of Deed bearing No. 5744 dated 17th June 1983. The Respondents,

however, contend that this transfer was bad in law as it is an alienation

deemed null and void as per Section 13 of the Land Reform Law.

5

On 22nd April 2013, more than 30 years after the conveyance, the

Chairman of the LRC by the letter (X5) had written to Deshamanya Siva

Obeyesekere (widow of the late Mr. J.P. Obeyesekere) stating inter alia that

some land which has to be handed over to the LRC, has not been handed

over yet. Among the lands listed for handover is the Medalanda Estate at

Colombo District of extent 22A.0R.22P.

(ii) Keenagaskebella

Keenagaskebella, also known as Keena House is located in the Nuwara

Eliya District and was initially owned by the late J. P Obeysekera. By way

of Deed of Transfer bearing No. 403 dated 5th February 1972, J.P.

Obeysekera transferred the land to the Petitioner for shares of the Petitioner

Company being the consideration. The Petitioner contends that this land

was not declared as agricultural land since it was used by the company for

tourism purposes, as a hotel project. A letter from the Ceylon Tourist Board

addressed to the Director of the Petitioner company dated 12th October

1973 confirms the existence of a Guesthouse at premises known as Keena

House in Nuwara Eliya, and therefore buttresses the above contention. As

with Medalanda, Keenagaskebella is also not mentioned in any of the

correspondence between the parties involved prior to the letter requesting

handover on 22nd April 2013 [X5] which states that Keenagaskebella

Nuwaraeliya District Plan No. 4568 Lot A of extent 7A.1R.08P must be

handed over to the LRC. What is significant is that J.P. Obeyesekere by a

letter dated 20th November 1972, put the LRC on notice that he would not

be declaring two properties in Form (1) [presumably the prescribed

declaration form in terms of the Land Reform Law] as they do not constitute

Agricultural Land. One is premises No.19, Race Course Avenue and the

other is Keena House Hotel and Premises which had received project

approval from the Tourist Board [X8]. It appears that for a period of over

30 years the LRC had not disputed the position taken by J.P. Obeyesekere.

6

Violation of Article 12(1)

1) It is now settled in our Fundamental Rights Jurisprudence that Article 12(1)

protects persons from any unlawful, arbitrary or mala fide executive or

administrative actions or omissions and guarantees natural justice and

legitimate expectations [vide Sampanthan vs. Hon. Attorney General and

Others SC. FR 351/2018]. Thus, in order to determine whether there has been

a violation and/or an imminent infringement, the submissions made by

learned Counsel for the respective parties along with the facts and the

applicable legal provisions, required to be analysed under each of the

impugned actions, in relation to the procedures and remedies prescribed by

law as they relate to each property and the interests of the Petitioner.

2) The Land Reform Law of 1972 was introduced with the aim of addressing

longstanding inequalities in land ownership and use, in the country. Prior to

the introduction of the law, the majority of agricultural land in Sri Lanka was

owned by a small number of wealthy individuals and corporations, while the

majority of the population lived in poverty and had limited access to land.

The law sought to redistribute land ownership and promote a more equitable

distribution of land by placing a limit on the amount of land that individuals

and corporations could own. It also established a system for the acquisition

and redistribution of excess land to landless peasants and small farmers and

sought to promote more sustainable land use practices by encouraging the

cultivation of crops. Section 2 of the Land Reform Law states that Purposes of

the law are:

(a) to ensure that no person shall own agricultural land in excess of the

ceiling; and

(b) to take over agricultural land owned by any person in excess of the

ceiling and to utilize such land in a manner which will result in an increase

in its productivity and in the employment generated from such land.

3) Among the powers assigned to the LRC by Section 44 of the Land Reform Law

7

are the powers to (a) acquire, hold, take or give on lease or hire, exchange,

mortgage, pledge, sell or otherwise dispose of, any movable or immovable

property, (b) carry out investigations, surveys and record data concerning

and relating to any agricultural land and call for returns in the prescribed

form concerning and relating to agricultural land; and encourage aspects of

land and (f) call for and receive such documents relating to title, valuation,

surveys and plans of agricultural land as may be necessary for carrying out

such objects. Broadly, it is acts committed in the pursuance of these powers

which are challenged in these proceedings.

4) It must first be mentioned that all correspondence relating to the handover of

the said lands has been addressed to Deshamanya Siva Obeysekera, and not

to the Petitioner company. The Petitioner company canvassed this application

to prevent the possession or seizure of lands owned by the Petitioner, which

are namely Medalanda and Keenagaskebella.

5) With regard to the Medalanda Estate, the final correspondence appears to be

the Appeal made [in terms of Section 13(3) of the LR Law] to the Minister, by

J. P. Obeyesekere way back in 1974, against an order made under Section

13(2) of the said Law[X5(a) dated 5th July 1974]. The appeal states that

Medalanda situated in the Nittambuwa Division in Colombo in extent

22A.0R.02P, which had been transferred to Maligawa Tours & Exports Ltd in

1972 was declared null and void by the LRC. No subsequent document, order

or letter refers to the Estate, and there is no indication of the consideration of

J.P Obeyesekeres appeal until 22nd April 2013. There is no material

whatsoever to indicate that the appeal had been considered when, more than

30 years after the conveyance, and almost 30 years after the appeal was made,

the Chairman of the LRC by way of letter (X5) written to Deshamanya Siva

Obeyesekere, requested the handover of the Estate.

6) It seems to me that any dispute over the ownership of Medalanda predating

the sale by the LRC [1st Respondent] to Chantal Hiranthi Obeysekera in 1982

8

is irrelevant for the purposes of determining the vires of the impugned acts,

as the Obeyesekeres and the Petitioner company accepted the LRCs claim of

ownership when they each purchased the land. It is the Respondents

submission that the subsequent transfer of ownership of Medalanda to the

Petitioner is illegal as it was executed in violation of Section 22(1)(a) of the

Land Reform Law. They contend that as Medalanda was initially sold to

Chantal Hiranthi Obeysekera under Section 22(1)(a) for the purposes of

agriculture or animal husbandry, the subsequent sale of Medalanda to the

Petitioner; a company which does not engage in agriculture or animal

husbandry, is illegal. Section 24(2) of the Land Reform Law provides the LRC

with the authority to cancel such initial alienation where any term or

condition subject to which agricultural land is alienated to any person by the

Commission is not complied with.

7) Section 24(2) prescribes the process of cancellation of such alienation as

follows: the Commission may by endorsement on a certified copy of the

instrument of alienation, cancel such alienation, and thereupon such

alienation shall be determined accordingly, and such agricultural land shall

re-vest in the Commission. The letter addressed to Deshamanya Siva

Obeyesekere requesting the handover of these lands [X5] notes that the

alienation of Medalanda is null and void by virtue of Section 13. Section 13(1)

requires persons alienating land held in excess of the ceiling (50 acres) on or

after 29th May 1971 to report such alienation to the Commission. Contrary

to the written submissions dated 5th June 2017, Section 13 does not require

alienors to seek the LRCs permission. Instead, Section 13(2) states that if

the transfers appear to have been made for the purpose of defeating the

purposes of the Land Reform Law, the Commission may by order made

under its hand declare that such alienation is null and void. Every such order

shall be sent by registered post to the alienor and alienee of the agricultural

land to which that order relates.

8) Accordingly, if the alienation of Medalanda to Maligawa Tours was contrary

9

to the terms of the initial alienation to Chantal H. Obeyesekere (as contended

by the Respondents), the LRC ought to have acted under Section 24(2) of the

Land Reform Law, in the manner prescribed therein. There is no material

before this court which suggests that such a course of action was taken.

Accordingly, it can be concluded that the alienation has not been cancelled

as per Section 24(2). The only mention of Medalanda after 1983 is in the

LRCs letter in 2013, and that too denotes the alienation of Medalanda to be

Sec 13 null and void. It is evident, therefore, that the only appropriate

remedy for an alienation made contrary to terms of transfers made under

Section 22(1)(a) of the Land Reform Law, which is an order of cancellation

as prescribed by Section 24(2) of the said Law, which course of action the

LRC has not carried out for over 30 years.

9) It is possible that the conflation arose from the Appeal made to the Minister

by J. P. Obeyesekere against an order made under Section 13(2) of the Land

Reform Law in 1974 (X5(a)). However, as stated before, the LRC cannot claim

the vires of its actions based on this document as the LRC itself transferred the

estate to Chantal Hiranthi Obeysekera (daughter of J.P. Obeysekera) by Deed

bearing No. 5619 dated 6th October 1982. Therefore, in failing to resort to

the appropriate remedy over three decades, and subsequently attempting to

possess the lands now owned by the Petitioner, the LRC has not acted within

the confines of the procedures prescribed by the Land Reform Law.

10) The Petitioner acquired ownership of Keenagaskebella by virtue of Deed No.

403 dated 5th February 1972, wherein J. P. Obeyesekere transferred the

property to the Petitioner. The Petitioner submits that the Petitioner was not

obliged to declare the land as it was not agricultural land and was used for

tourist projects. Additionally, the Petitioner notes that the fact that the land is

being used entirely for tourist projects was informed to the LRC as far back as

1972 (letter marked X8). Furthermore, the letter from the Ceylon Tourist

Board addressed to the Director of the Petitioner company dated 12th October

1973 (marked X9) confirms the existence of a Guesthouse at premises

10

known as Keena House in Nuwara Eliya, and therefore affirms the above

contention. Finally, the Petitioner notes that the appeal tendered by Mr. J. P.

in 1974 (marked and produced as X5(a)), dated 5th July 1974, does not list

Keenagaskebella as a land whose alienation was ordered null and void as

per Section 13, and contends that this is further evidence of the fact that there

was no dispute with regards to the legality of the alienation of

Keenagaskebella. I also wish to observe that the factual inaccuracy of the

letter X5. X5 refers to Keenagaskebella as; Keenagaskebella Nuwaraeliya

District Plan No. 4568 Lot A. As per the Deed of Transfer (X3(a)) in its

Schedule the said land is described as a land depicted in Plan No. 4565. There

is no mention of a Plan No. 4568 in any of the related documents submitted

to court besides X5. It would appear therefore that the X5 was erroneous in

fact too, as it relates to Keenagaskebella.

11) It was the submission of the Respondents that land holders cannot be the

arbiter of whether or not the lands held by them are agricultural lands. And

that determination has to be made by the LRC alone. Accordingly, they

contend that not declaring all lands held in excess of the ceiling would be

an offence as per Section 18(5) of the Land Reform Law [hereinafter

referred to as the Law]. They further submit that the letters marked X8

and X9 which the Petitioner relies on to substantiate the contention that

Keenagaskebella is used for tourism purposes cannot be taken to confirm

the position that Keenagaskebella should not have been declared because it

was not used for agricultural purposes as the Land Reform Law does not

in any way grant lands for hotel projects (vide written submission dated

5th June 2017).

12) It appears to me that the submissions of the parties address a

fundamental question regarding the Land Reform Law; whether all

lands held in excess of the ceiling must be declared, and whether the

LRC is permitted by law from considering utilization all such lands for

the purposes of the Land Reform Law, even if the said lands bear no

11

relevance or use to agriculture. To that effect, it was submitted by the

Respondents [written submission dated 5th June 2017] that All lands

over 50 acres comes by operation of law to the LRC. Whether it is

agricultural or not is a decision to be taken by the LRC and not by an

individual. It would be pertinent, at this stage, to examine the process

by which owners of agricultural land may be allowed to retain certain

portions of such land. As per Section 3(2) of the Land Reform Law, upon

the law coming into force, by operation of Law, any agricultural land

owned by any person in excess of the ceiling was deemed to vest in the

LRC and such person is deemed to be a statutory lessee of the LRC. This

deeming provision is followed by Section 18, which mandates that such

person should make a "statutory declaration", in the prescribed form of

the total extent of the agricultural land so held by him on such lease.

Finally, as per Section 19, the LRC may make a "statutory determination",

specifying the portion or portions of the agricultural land owned by the

statutory lessee which he shall be allowed to retain, and publish such

determination in the Gazette. It is crucial to note that Section 3(2) only

contemplates the declaration of agricultural land held in excess of the

ceiling. The Petitioners contention rests on the argument that

Keenagaskebella, also known as Keena Cottage, is not agricultural land,

and therefore does not have to be declared as per Section 18 because it

did not initially vest in the LRC. The Petitioner contends that Keena

Cottage is found in the Nuwara Eliya Town, within the Municipal

Council limits and has been used, and continues to be used for the

operation of a Tourist Hotel, and that accordingly, the land cannot be

used for agricultural purposes.

13) To determine what constitutes agricultural land, I have reproduced the

interpretation provided in Section 66 of the Land Reform Law:

"agricultural land" means land used or capable of being used for

agriculture within the meaning given in this Law and shall include

12

private lands, lands alienated under the Land Development Ordinance

or the State Lands Ordinance or any other enactment and includes also

things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything

attached to the earth but shall exclude

(a) any cultivated agricultural land owned or possessed by a public

company on May 29, 1971, so long and so long only as such

land continues to be so owned or possessed by such company;

(b) any such land which was viharagam or devalagam land on May

29, 1971, so long and so long only as such land continues to be

so owned or possessed;

(c) any such land which was owned or possessed by a religious

institution on May 29, 1971, so long and so long only as such

land continues to be so owned or possessed by such religious

institution;

(d) any such land which on May 29, 1971, constituted a charitable

trust as defined in the Trusts Ordinance or a Muslim charitable

trust or wakf as defined in the Muslim Mosques and Charitable

Trusts or Wakfs Act, so long and so long only as such land

continues to be so owned or possessed as such trust;

(e) any such land held in trust on May 29, 1971, under the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance so long and so long only as such land is

held in trust under that Ordinance

It is evident that none of the exclusions apply in this case. What is of vital

relevance in the above interpretation is the phrase means land used or

capable of being used for agriculture. This interpretation lends credence to

the contention that only land which could be used for agricultural purposes

is required to be declared by the owners. The Petitioner, in its written

submission dated 7th June 2017 drew reference to the interpretation

provided for the word agriculture in Section 66 of the Land Reform Law.

" agriculture " includes

13

(i) the growing of rice, all field crops, spices and condiments,

industrial crops, vegetables, fruits, flowers, pasture and fodder;

(ii) dairy farming, livestock-rearing and breeding;

(iii) plant and fruit nurseries

14) Accordingly, it would be a misconception to state that the Land Reform

Law requires owners to make a declaration in relation to all lands held

in excess of the ceiling. One must be conscious of the fact that the

drafters of this law, in their wisdom, provided a comprehensive

interpretation of what may be identified as agricultural land and laid

the process of Land Reform in a manner that requires owners of land to

make declarations as per that interpretation. Where landowners fail to

act per the interpretation in an attempt to defeat the Law, the drafters

provided the LRC with the authority to take remedial action under

Section 18(5) of the Law, which holds non-declaration of agricultural

land to be an offence read with Section 63 of the Law, which provides

the procedure for conviction upon commission of the offence. While I

find it hard to agree with the Petitioners contention that the land cannot

be used for the growing of any crops or farming or planting, the

submissions of the Respondents warrant questioning as to why the

realization that the said land in question could be used for agricultural

purposes did not arise for over 30 years. The Respondents have provided

no reason for their inaction from 1972 to 2013, or as to why they are

attempting to take over and possess lands alienated by transactions

which were allegedly known to have been improper 30 years ago.

15) It appears that the LRC had only got activated after all these years,

because of the petitions received, criticising the LRC for their inaction

on their part. In a letter [X4(h)] addressed to Deshamanya Siva

Obeyesekere, the Chairman of the LRC states there are ample petitions

against you stating that you are enjoying an extent more than approved

by the Commission and the letter goes on to state; The

14

Commission also under strong criticism for not taking legal action

against you. Any action on the part of the LRC should be based on

the law and merely not on public petitions. The LRC is free to take action

based on such complaints only after the proper inquiries are conducted

and action is merited under the Land Reform Law, which does not

appear to be the case in this instance.

16) Furthermore, the Respondents did not afford the Petitioner any

opportunity to be heard and voice its grievances even after repeatedly

being informed by Deshamanya Siva Obeyesekere that the Petitioner

company was the lawful owner of the said lands. It must also be noted

that the Legal Consultant to the LRC, Mahanama Thilekaratne directed

the LRC to conduct an inquiry into the matter after observing that the

particular file, which had been closed for over 30 years was re-opened

and action was pursued under it. This is evident in the letter marked X6.

Neglecting the said direction and its subsequent conduct therefore

wholly contravenes Principles of Natural Justice. It is regrettable that an

agency charged with an administrative task as significant as the vesting

and conveying of private property is seemingly negligent, indifferent

and unwilling to abide by the principle of audi alteram partem , a core

tenet of administrative law.

17) As stated before, Article 12(1) protects all persons from arbitrary

executive or administrative action. The petitioner company, being a duly

incorporated entity, is a juristic person who may claim the protection of

this court .[vide Sunway International (Pvt) Ltd & Another vs. Airport &

Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited & Others, SC. FR 147/2017]. A

persons Fundamental Right to equal protection of the law is infringed

when public authorities fail to treat such person as mandated by law. It

is apparent that the Respondents have failed to treat the Petitioner as

mandated by the law and are now attempting to indirectly seize or

possess Petitioners lands (vide letter marked X5) without following the

15

remedies prescribed by law or basic procedures which ensure

administrative justice. In conclusion, I hold that the 1st Respondent

would violate the Petitioners Fundamental Right to Equal Protection of

the Law guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution if it acted

upon listings (c) and (e) of the letter marked X5 dated 22nd April 2013.

18) Additionally, I wish to note that while it does not bear relevance to the

principal merits of this case, it would be reasonable, upon examination

of the correspondence between the 2nd Respondent and Deshamanya

Siva Obeyesekere (letters marked X4(a) to X4(g)), to draw the

conclusion that the LRC exhibited manifest refusal to consider the merits

of Deshamanya Siva Obeyesekeres plea relating to the impugned

actions, and an utter lack of professionalism. In some consecutive letters,

certain paragraphs appear to have been reproduced and replicated

without consideration of the matters pleaded in the prior

correspondence. Such conduct by officers holding public office,

exercising powers and responsibilities conferred on them by law for the

benefit of the People, warrants serious note.

19) The present Application by the Petitioner, Maligawa Tours and Exports

(PVT) Ltd is in relation to the lands referred to in listings (c) and (e) of

the letter dated 22nd April 2013 addressed to Deshamanya Siva

Obeyesekere [ X5] by the Chairman LRC.

Conclusions by the Court

For the reasons enumerated above, I declare that an imminent

infringement of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner guaranteed

under Article 12(1) of the Constitution has been established by the

Petitioner. Until such time an inquiry is held affording an opportunity

to the Petitioner to make representations, the 1st Respondent is directed

not to resort to appropriate procedures laid down in the Land Reform

16

Law in relation to listings (c) and (e) referred to, under paragraph 10,

on page 2 of the said letter marked X5 dated 22nd April 2013 [which

are impugned in these proceedings]. The said listings [c and e] are

reproduced below;

(c) Medalanda Estate at Colombo District - 22A.0R.22P

(e) Keenagaskebella Nuwaraeliya District Plan No 4568 Lot A -7A 1R

08P

In the circumstances of this case, I order no costs.
