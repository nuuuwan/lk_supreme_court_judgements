Facts of the case

This is an appeal to set aside the Order of the Commercial High Court dated 12th of March, 2013

granting an interim injunction restraining the parate execution of a mortgaged property until the

conclusion of the trial.

The 2nd plaintiff-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 2nd respondent), who is the wife of

the 1st plaintiff-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1st respondent), had obtained a housing

loan of Rs. 8 Million on the 12th of April, 2005 from the defendant-appellant (hereinafter referred

to as the appellant bank) by mortgaging the property described in the schedule to the plaint as

security, which is owned by her. In addition to the above security, the 1st respondent had given a

personal guarantee to secure the said loan.

Thereafter, the 2nd respondent had obtained another loan of Rs. 6 Million on the 17th of January,

2007 from the appellant bank against the same property by entering into a secondary mortgage.

Further, the said loan was settled in full by the 2nd respondent and the secondary mortgage bond

had been discharged by the appellant bank.

Subsequently, the respondents had jointly obtained another loan of Rs. 5 Million on the 25th of

February, 2008 from the appellant bank by entering into a secondary mortgage as security against

the same property.

After some time, the respondents had defaulted on the repayment of both the said loans. Hence,

the appellant bank had sent a letter of demand dated 14th of February, 2011 to the respondents,

requesting them to settle the money due to the appellant bank.

However, as the respondents did not pay the money due on the aforesaid loans, the appellant bank

had passed a resolution for the sale of the said mortgaged property by parate execution to recover

the sum due on the aforesaid loans.

The said resolution dated 20th of December, 2011 states inter alia, to sell the mortgaged property

by public auction for the following reasons:

4

(a) recovery of a sum of Rs. 4,670,691/- with further interest at 12% per annum from the

17th of September, 2011 together with costs of advertising and any other incurred less

payments (if any) since received; and

(b) recovery of a sum of Rs. 9,129,306/- with further interest on a sum of Rs. 5 Million per

annum from the 17th of September, 2011 to date of sale together with costs of

advertising and any other incurred less payments (if any) since received.

In the circumstances, the respondents instituted action against the appellant bank in the

Commercial High Court on the 30th of May, 2012 alleging that the resolution passed by the

appellant bank to parate execute the said mortgaged property to recover both the aforesaid loans

is unlawful as the appellant bank was not entitled to treat the loan of Rs. 8 Million in default.

Further, the respondents prayed for an interim injunction staying the sale of the mortgaged property

by parate execution.

Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge, by his Order dated 12th of March, 2013 granted an

interim injunction restraining the appellant bank and any persons acting under it from selling the

said mortgaged property until the conclusion of the said case in the Commercial High Court.

Being aggrieved by the said Order of the Commercial High Court, the appellant bank appealed to

this court and this court granted leave to appeal on the following questions of law:

ii) the Learned High Court Judge erred gravely in law and misdirected himself in law in failing

to consider the provisions of s.12 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act

No. 4 of 1990 by which the Defendant Bank has been specifically empowered by the legislature

to adopt a resolution of the manner of X14 and take steps thereunder;

v) the Learned High Court Judge gravely erred in law and misdirected himself in law in failing to

take cognizance of the fact that the Plaintiffs were expressly barred from obtaining the relief

prayed for in the plaint in law;

vi) the Learned High Court Judge gravely erred in law and misdirected himself in law in failing to

consider and/or apply and/or properly apply the tests required for the grant of an interim

injunction in the delivery of his Order.

Further, the learned counsel for the respondents raised the following question of law to be

considered by this court:

5

In any event in the totality of the circumstances of this case and in view of the

amendments brought to Act No. 01/11 (Section 5(A) and Section 22) and as further

amended by Act N. 19/11, was a High Court Judge in event right in granting the interim

injunction.

The Learned High Court Judge erred gravely in law and misdirected himself in law in failing

to consider the provisions of s. 12 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions)

Act No. 4 of 1990 by which the Defendant Bank has been specifically empowered by the

legislature to adopt a resolution of the nature of X14 and take steps thereunder

In respect of the above question of law, the issue that needs to be considered is whether the

appellant bank has been conferred with the power under section 12 of the Recovery of Loans by

Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 (hereinafter referred to as the Recovery of Loans

by Banks Act) to adopt a resolution to authorise the sale of a mortgaged property for the recovery

of money due on two or more loans when the respondents have defaulted only on one loan.

In terms of section 3 read with section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act, whenever a

default is made in the payment of any sum due on any loan granted to a borrower, the Board of

Directors of the bank may, inter alia, pass a resolution to sell the mortgaged property by public

auction to recover the whole of the unpaid portion of such loan.

However, in terms of section 5A(1) of the said Act, a bank is not entitled to recover a loan under

the said Act if the principal sum of the loan does not exceed Rs. 5 Million. Further, the interest

accrued on such a loan or the penalty imposed thereon shall not be taken into consideration when

calculating the principal sum borrowed by a borrower from the bank. Thus, the said section

contemplates situations where the principal sum given as a loan or money advanced should be

more than Rs. 5 Million to fall within the purview of the Act.

In the instant appeal, the principal amounts borrowed from the appellant bank are Rs. 8 Million

and Rs. 5 Million. Thus, both loans exceed the Rs. 5 Million threshold stipulated in the said section.

Hence, the bank is entitled by law to invoke the provisions of the said Act to recover both loans

granted to the borrower.

6

In the circumstances, the appellant bank has passed a resolution under section 4 of the said Act to

recover the total sum of the money due on the mortgage bond as well as on the secondary mortgage

loan by authorising the sale of the property.

Further, the appellant bank has published a notice of the resolution in the Gazette dated 11th of

May, 2012 and in three daily newspapers, and copies of such publications were sent to the

respondents in terms of section 8 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act. Nevertheless, the

respondents had not settled the arrears due to the appellant bank on the Rs. 5 Million loan.

Therefore, the appellant bank had advertised the sale of the mortgaged property to recover the total

sum due to it in respect of both loans under section 9 of the said Act and served copies of the

notices of sale on the respondents.

Section 12 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks reads as follows:

(1) In any case where two or more loans have been granted by a Bank on the

security of the same property and, default made in the payment of any sum

due upon any one or more of such loans, the foregoing provisions of this Act

shall apply notwithstanding that default may not been made in respect of the

other loan or any of the other loans and the Board may, in any such case, by

resolution under section 4 authorise the sale of the property for the recovery

of the total amount due to the Bank in respect of both or all of the loans, as

the case may be, and these provisions shall apply accordingly.

(2) Nothing in section 3 to 15 (both sections inclusive) shall be read or construed

as prohibiting a Bank from recovering the amount due on a mortgage bond in

accordance with the provisions of any other law.

[emphasis added]

Accordingly, the words notwithstanding that default may not have been made in respect of the

other loan referred to in section 12(1) means that where two or more loans have been granted to

a borrower against the security of the same property and if a borrower defaults to repay any one or

more of those loans, the bank is entitled to pass a resolution under section 4 of the said Act to

authorise the sale of the mortgaged property for the recovery of the total amount due to the bank

in respect of all the loans granted to a borrower even though the borrower has not defaulted on the

other loans granted to him by the bank.

7

If the said section is interpreted to mean that, when two or more loans have been granted on the

security of the same property, a bank is not entitled to sell the mortgaged property to recover the

money due on loans that are being defaulted merely because the other loans have been serviced

without any default, the bank would not be able to recover the money due on the defaulting loan.

Such an interpretation would render the said section nugatory.

Thus, the appellant bank is entitled to pass a resolution in terms of section 12(1) of the said Act

for the sale of the mortgaged property to recover the total amount due on both of the aforesaid

loans, even though there was no default in the re-payment of the loan of Rs. 8 Million since both

of the aforesaid loans have been granted on the security of the same property.

Therefore, I am of the view that the appellant bank is entitled to sell the said mortgaged property

to recover the total sum due to the bank on both of the aforesaid loans.

However, section 14 of the said Act stipulates that if there is any excess money remaining from

the proceeds of sale of the said mortgaged property, it should pay the balance remaining, if any, to

the borrower after deducting from the amount due on the mortgage and the money and Costs

recoverable under section 13 of the said Act.

In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the learned High Court Judge erred in law in failing

to hold that the appellant bank has been specifically conferred power under section 12 of the

Recovery of Loans by Banks Act to adopt the resolution marked and produced as X14 to take

steps to sell the said mortgaged property to recover the outstanding money due on both of the

aforesaid loans.

The Learned High Court Judge gravely erred in law and misdirected himself in law in failing

to consider and/or apply and/or properly apply the tests required for the grant of an interim

injunction in the delivery of his Order

The learned High Court Judge, by his Order, granted an interim injunction restraining the appellant

bank from selling the said mortgaged property until the conclusion of the said case in the

Commercial High Court.

However, as stated above, the appellant bank is entitled to sell the mortgaged property to recover

the money due to the bank. In view of the aforementioned findings and taking into consideration

8

the other facts and circumstances of the case, I am of the opinion that the respondents have failed

to establish a prima facie case in favour of them and that the balance of convenience lied in favour

of the appellant bank, as section 12 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act allows the bank to sell

the mortgaged property to recover the money due to them.

Therefore, I am of the view that the High Court Judge erred by not properly applying the

aforementioned tests required for the grant of an interim injunction and issuing an interim

injunction preventing the appellant bank from parate executing the mortgaged property.

Conclusion

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the following questions of law should be answered as

follows;

the Learned High Court Judge erred gravely in law and misdirected himself in law in failing to

consider the provisions of s.12 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4

of 1990 by which the Defendant Bank has been specifically empowered by the legislature to adopt

a resolution of the nature of X14 and take steps thereunder.

Yes

the Learned High Court Judge gravely erred in law and misdirected himself in law in failing to

consider and/or apply and/or properly apply the tests required for the grant of an interim injunction

in the delivery of his Order.

Yes

Due to the foregoing answers, the other questions of law need not be considered.

Therefore, the appeal is allowed. I set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge.
