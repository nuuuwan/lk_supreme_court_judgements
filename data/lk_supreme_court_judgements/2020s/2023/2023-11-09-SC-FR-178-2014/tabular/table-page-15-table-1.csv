the  existing  scheme  of"
"recruitment was adopted. Whereas the existing scheme of recruitment required only 12"
"years of service and the Petitioners were all possessed of more than 12 years of experience"
"at the closing date of applications, they were eligible for promotion and therefore could"
"not  have  been  denied  marks  for  service  by  the  Respondents  on  the  basis  that  the"
"Petitioners were not eligible."
"Furthermore, 
the  Petitioners 
state 
that 
the  2nd  Respondent’s  objections  are 
self-"
"contradictory as the existing scheme of recruitment was adopted since the new scheme"
"of recruitment had not come into force, but paragraph 14 of the statement of objections,"
"states  that  the  Petitioners  were  not  eligible  for  the  promotion  in  terms  of  the  existing"
"Scheme of Recruitment. Therefore, if the existing Scheme of Recruitment was followed,"

"The Petitioners point out that the 2nd Respondent has failed to file the purported Board"
