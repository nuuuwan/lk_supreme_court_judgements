"Rights  Commission  ‘P27’  taking  up  the  position  that;  at  a  meeting  of  the  Board  of"
"Directors of the 1st Respondent Board held on 16.08.2010, the Scheme of Recruitment"
"has been amended to require NCT and 17 years of experience as an Engineering Assistant"
"including 3 years as a Board Grade 7 Engineering Assistant. Furthermore, regarding the"
"1st Petitioner, he was appointed as a Technical Assistant on 04.06.1996 and he completed"
"17 years of service on 04.06.2013, therefore has been considered by the Interview Panel"
"as a candidate who has not fulfilled the required qualifications."
"On  17.05.2013  the  1st  Respondent  Board  filed  Observations  ‘P28’  with  regard  to  the"
"complaint made by the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners by which they took up the position that;"
"the  applications  were  called  for  the  said  post  in  terms  of  the  Scheme  of  Recruitment"
"applicable at the time, in terms of which the NCT and 12 years of experience of which 3"
"years’ experience in a Board Grade 7 Engineering Assistant post was required, but the"
"Board of Directors considered the representations made by Trade Unions that requiring"
"12  years  of  experience  from  both  those  possessing  NCT  and  those  possessing  NDT"
"(National Diploma in Technology) would have the effect of not giving the due recognition"
"to the NDT qualification, and therefore increased the required number of years of service"
"for NCT qualification holders to 17 years. The 2nd Respondent, in his objections, admitted"
"these  averments  and  further  clarified  that  12  years  of  experience  was  considered  for"
"applicants with NDT and that NCT cannot be equated with NDT."
"A true copy of the purported Board Decision filed by the 1st Respondent before the Human"
"Rights Commission ‘P29’ was submitted to this court by the Petitioners. The Petitioners,"
"however, state that ‘P29’ is not a Board Decision as maintained by the 1st Respondent and"
"merely a document containing the proposed Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion. The"
"Petitioners point out that the document carries no indication that the Board of Directors"
"of  the  1st  Respondent  has  approved  the  said  proposed  Scheme  of  Recruitment  and"
"Promotion.  The  Petitioners  further  state  that  the  1st  Respondent  failed  to  produce  a"
"certified copy of the purported Board Decision dated 16.08.2010 to the Human Rights"
"Commission.  In  the  circumstances,  the  Petitioners  state  that  they  verily  believe  that  a"
"decision to amend the Scheme of Recruitment was not taken."
