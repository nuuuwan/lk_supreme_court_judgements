"waiting  list.  In  response  to  an  appeal  submitted  by  the  Petitioner  dated  10.08.2010"
"(‘CA3’)  seeking  to  be  promoted  to  the  post  of  Electrical  Engineer,  the  then  General"
"Manager (Personnel) of the 1st Respondent had informed the 1st Petitioner by letter dated"
"29.09.2010 (‘CA4’) that there were no vacancies for the post of Electrical Engineer and"
"requested the 1st Petitioner to apply for the post in the next round of promotions. At no"
"time  was  the  1st  Petitioner  informed  that  he  was  not  eligible  for  promotion  to  the"
"impugned  post  (vide ‘CA1’  and  ‘CA2’  letters  sent  by  the  1st  Respondent  Board  dated"
"24.06.2009 and 07.05.2008 respectively calling the 1st Petitioner for interviews for the"
"post of ‘Electrical Engineer Class II’)."
"Alleged Violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution"
"Applications  for  the  post  of  ‘Engineer-Class  II’  were  called  under  the  purported  new"
"Scheme of Recruitment and not under the  existing Scheme of Recruitment (vide ‘P24’"
"letter calling for applications dated 19.03.2012 which requires 17 years of experience"
"including 3 years’ experience in the post of ‘Engineer Assistant-Class 1’ from those with"
"the  NCT  qualification).  The  2nd  Respondent  has  taken  up  contradictory  positions  in"
"stating which Scheme of Recruitment was resorted to in selecting the Petitioners for the"
"interviews  for  promotion.  By  paragraph  13  of  his  statement  of  objections  the  2nd"
"Respondent has verily accepted that the Scheme of Recruitment resorted to with regard"
"to the Petitioners was the existing Scheme of Recruitment as the purported new Scheme"
"of Recruitment had not come into force by then."
"As the 2nd Respondent himself has accepted that the existing Scheme of Recruitment was"
"resorted to regarding the Petitioners, it only remains for this Court to consider whether"
"the Petitioners were in fact possessed of the requisite eligibility to apply for the post of"
"‘Engineer-Class II’. The Court’s inquiry is made easier by the fact that all three Petitioners"
"were called for interview by the 1st Respondent Board. The Court is inclined to consider"
"the  said  fact  as  a prima facie  indication  that  the  1st  Respondent  Board  considered  the"
"Petitioners eligible, contrary to the 2nd Respondent’s contention that the Petitioners were"
"not eligible to apply. As held by His Lordship Justice Fernando’s statement in Abeysinghe"
