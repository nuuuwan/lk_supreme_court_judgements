Judgement

Aluwihare P.C J.

This Fundamental Rights Application relates to the Petitioners promotion to the post of

Engineer Class II of the 1st Respondent Board. The 1st Petitioner is presently in the post

of Engineer Assistant-Special Class and the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners are presently in the

post of Engineer Assistant Class I of the 1st Respondent Board. The principal grievance

of the Petitioners is that they were denied the opportunity to be promoted to the post of

Engineer Class II in violation of the Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion hence, the

Petitioners rights enshrined in Article 12(1) of the Constitution was breached by the

arbitrary and/or unreasonable actions of the Respondents. On the 01.08.2014 the Court

granted Leave to Proceed under Article 12(1) Constitution.

Service Record of the 1st Petitioner

The 1st Petitioner joined the Water Board on 10.08.1992 as an Electrician (Power) I and

obtained the National Certificate in Technology (Electrical) (hereinafter referred to as the

NCT) on 24.02.1995. He was then appointed as Technical Assistant (Electrical) on

15.05.1996. On 10.08.1997 he was promoted to Engineering Assistant-Class III in

consideration of his 5 years of service and the NCT qualification as well as his service as

a Technical Assistant as per the Letter of Promotion P5 dated 13.01.1998. After 2 years

as an Engineering Assistant-Class III the Petitioner was promoted to Engineering

Assistant-Class II with effect from 10.08.1999 as per the Letter of Promotion P6 dated

26.06.2000. Thereafter, upon the completion of 2 years in the aforesaid position, the

Petitioner was promoted to Engineer Assistant-Class I on 10.08.2001 as per the Letter

of Promotion P7 dated 29.08.2006.

According to the Scheme of Recruitment a person with 12 years of experience of which

3 years of experience as an Engineering Assistant Class I are entitled to be promoted to

Engineering Assistant Special Class. It is asserted by the 1st Petitioner that he was

entitled to be promoted to that post on 10.08.2004 but his promotion to the post of

Engineering Assistant Special Class was effected only on 04.06.2008 as per the Letter

of Promotion P8 dated 01.02.2010. The 1st Petitioner states that in promoting the 1st

6

Petitioner, the 1st Respondent Board has failed to consider the 1st Petitioners service as

an Electrician and has only counted his service since he was promoted to a Technical

Assistant in 1996. The 1st Petitioners request to consider his service as an Electrician and

backdate his appointment to the Special Class was rejected by the 1st Respondent Board

by Letter dated 23.08.2011 marked P9. Currently, the 1st Petitioner is covering duties

in the post of Electrical Engineer as indicated by the letters dated 18.11.2011 and

14.06.2012 marked P10A and P10B.

Service Record of the 2nd Petitioner

The 2nd Petitioner obtained the NCT (Electrical) on 27.05.1992. He joined the 1st

Respondent Board as an Electrician (Power) Grade 1 on 10.08.1992 and was confirmed

in service with effect from the same date P12A and P12B. Thereafter, the 2nd Petitioner

was promoted to the post of Technical Assistant (Electrical)-II with effect from

15.03.1996 as per Letter of Appointment P13 dated 11. 03.1996. He was promoted to

the post of Engineering Assistant (Electrical)-Class III with effect from 27.05.1997 and

then to the post of Engineering Assistant-Class II with effect from 27.05.1999 as per the

Letters of Appointment P14 and P15. The 2nd Petitioner was promoted to the post of

Engineering Assistant-Class I with effect from 09.11.2007. Subsequently by letter dated

15.12.2008, the said promotion was backdated to 08.06.2007. True copies of the said

letters dated 18.01.2008 and 15.12.2008 respectively, were marked P16A and P16B.

Service Record of the 3rd Petitioner

The 3rd Petitioner obtained the NCT (Electrical) on 27.06.1996 as evidenced by the

certificate P17. In addition to the aforesaid qualification, the 3rd Petitioner obtained the

National Diploma in Engineering Technology (Electrical/Electronic Engineering)

awarded by the University of Vocational Technology as indicated by P18.

On 15.07.1996, the 3rd Petitioner joined the 1st Respondent Board as an Electrician

(Power)-Grade I as per the Letter of Appointment P19 and was promoted to the post of

Technical Assistant (Electrical) on 10.09.1999 as per the Letter of Appointment P20.

Thereafter, the 3rd Petitioner was promoted to the post of Engineering Assistant-Class III

with effect from 10.09.2002, and subsequently, to the post of Engineering Assistant-

7

Class II with effect from 10.09.2004 as per the Letters of Appointment P21 and P22

respectively. The 3rd Petitioner was promoted to the post of Engineering Assistant-Class

I by Letter dated 15.12.2008 and the said promotion was subsequently backdated to

08.06.2007 by the said Letter dated 15.12.2008 marked P23. The below table illustrates

Promotion to the post of Engineer-Class II

According to the Petitioners, the next promotion of the Petitioners is to the post of

Engineer - Class II as per the Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion marked P 1. As

per the Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion, applicants who possess the NCT and 12

years of experience of which 3 years of experience as an Engineering Assistant Class I

8

are eligible to be promoted to the post of Engineer Class II. It appears from the service

record that all three Petitioners fulfilled the requisite requirements.

By a notice dated 19.03.2012 marked P 24 applications for the post of Engineer Class

II were called. The applicants were required to possess NCT and 17 years of experience

in the 1st Respondent Board of which 3 years as an Engineering Assistant Class I.

According to the Petitioners, they informed the 1st Respondent Board that the Scheme of

Recruitment and Promotion only requires 12 years of experience, meanwhile, the notice

marked P 24 requires 17 years of experience. However, the Petitioners were informed

that a decision was taken by the Board of Directors of the 1st Respondent Board to

increase the number of years of experience to 17 years. The Petitioners contend that the

decision was not communicated to the employees of the 1st Respondent Board. The

Petitioners further alleged that the notice marked P 24 is based on a proposed Scheme

of Recruitment and Promotion, which was not duly approved by the relevant authorities

or as per the established procedure. The 2nd Respondent denies this averment and states

that the respective trade unions of which the Petitioners are members, were informed of

the change effected in the eligibility criteria. The 2nd Respondent admits that although a

copy of the relevant board decision was communicated it was not accompanied by a

covering letter. In their counter-affidavit, the Petitioners deny that the trade unions were

informed and state that the Respondents have failed to submit any proof of informing the

trade unions. Furthermore, it was submitted that not being a member of any trade union,

the 3rd Petitioner could not have known of the said Board Decision even if it was informed

to the trade unions.

In any event, the Petitioners applied for the said post in terms of the Letter marked P 24

and according to the Petitioners as of the closing date of the application which is

05.04.2012, they possessed the NCT and had experience at the 1st Respondent Board in

the following manner;

The Petitioners stated that they were called for an interview and that they faced the

interview. The Petitioners submitted, marked P25, the Recommended Marking Scheme

for Internal Promotions to the post of Engineer (Board Grade VII) for awarding marks at

the interview. According to the Petitioners, the Petitioners themselves and the 7th to 11th

Respondents and one A.L. Kapila Bandu were called to the interview. The said Kapila

Bandu was not named as a Respondent to the present application as he did not present

himself at the interview to the best of the knowledge of the Petitioners.

The Petitioners state that on or about 05.02.2013, they became aware that the 7th to 10th

Respondents had been promoted to the post of Engineer-Class II with effect from 1st

February 2013, and that upon further inquiry they learned that the said Respondents had

obtained the following marks.

I. 7th Respondent - 66.5 marks

II. 8th Respondent - 66.5 marks

III. 9th Respondent - 61.5 marks

IV. 10th Respondent - 72 marks

The 2nd Respondent states that these marks are inaccurate. The 2nd Respondent further

states that no marks were given at the interviews for the respective periods of service and

in any event the Petitioners did not meet the eligibility criteria. The Petitioners contend

as per their counter affidavits that the 2nd Respondent willfully suppressed the interview

10

marks schedule from this Court as the 2nd Respondent has not submitted the said

schedule.

Regarding the marks awarded at the interview, the Petitioners submit that the 1st, 2nd and

3rd Petitioners, on the other hand, had been awarded only a total of 25 marks, 23 marks

and 27 marks respectively. The Petitioners state that they made inquiries and discovered

that no marks have been awarded to them for their service, although the 1st and 2nd

Petitioners had 19 years of service and the 3rd Petitioner had 15 years of service at the

closing date of applications. The Petitioners state that to the best of their knowledge, they

have been denied marks for service on the basis that they are not eligible to apply,

although the 1st and 2nd Petitioners have completed 19 years of service whereas the notice

calling for applications requires only 17 years of service. Furthermore, the Petitioners

contend that P24 is a proposed Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion, which requires

17 years of experience and is not duly approved by the relevant authorities. In contrast,

the Approved Scheme of Recruitment P 1 requires 12 years of experience, hence, in the

aforesaid circumstances, the Petitioners allege that the Interview Panel has acted

arbitrarily in denying the Petitioners marks for seniority.

It was further contended that, even in the round of promotions to the post of Engineer-

Class II held in 2009 the 1st Petitioners name was included in the waiting list indicating

that the 1st Petitioner was duly awarded marks for his service in terms of the Approved

Scheme of Recruitment. Therefore, there is no rationale on which the 1st Petitioner could

be denied marks for service in the current round of interviews.

The Petitioners state that they would be entitled to be promoted if marks had been

awarded for their service period, with the 1st Petitioner earning 70 marks, the 2nd

Petitioner earning 63.5 marks and the 3rd Petitioner earning 50.5 marks. The Petitioners

submitted in tabular form a calculation of the marks that they are entitled to receive

according to the marking scheme as per their inquiries made at the 1st Respondent Board.

The said table is produced below in the following manner however it should be

emphasized by the Court that these marks are per the Petitioners inquiries and no

interview mark schedules were produced before the Court by the Respondents.

Petitioners further submitted that 7 vacancies were available at the time of calling for

applications by the 1st Respondent Board. However, the 2nd Respondent in paragraph 16

of his affidavit states that there were only 6 vacancies available at the time. In any event,

the Petitioners illustrate the order of their promotions in the following manner if there

were 7 impugned vacancies and if they were awarded the purported entitled marks for

their service period;

Inquiry Before the Human Rights Commission

On becoming aware of the promotion of the 7th to 10th Respondents to the post of

Engineer-Class II the Petitioners lodged a complaint on 15.02.2013 before the Human

Rights Commission (marked P26A, P26B and P26C) bearing No. HRC/605/2003. In

respect of the said complaint, the Respondents filed Observations before the Human

12

Rights Commission P27 taking up the position that; at a meeting of the Board of

Directors of the 1st Respondent Board held on 16.08.2010, the Scheme of Recruitment

has been amended to require NCT and 17 years of experience as an Engineering Assistant

including 3 years as a Board Grade 7 Engineering Assistant. Furthermore, regarding the

1st Petitioner, he was appointed as a Technical Assistant on 04.06.1996 and he completed

17 years of service on 04.06.2013, therefore has been considered by the Interview Panel

as a candidate who has not fulfilled the required qualifications.

On 17.05.2013 the 1st Respondent Board filed Observations P28 with regard to the

complaint made by the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners by which they took up the position that;

the applications were called for the said post in terms of the Scheme of Recruitment

applicable at the time, in terms of which the NCT and 12 years of experience of which 3

years experience in a Board Grade 7 Engineering Assistant post was required, but the

Board of Directors considered the representations made by Trade Unions that requiring

12 years of experience from both those possessing NCT and those possessing NDT

(National Diploma in Technology) would have the effect of not giving the due recognition

to the NDT qualification, and therefore increased the required number of years of service

for NCT qualification holders to 17 years. The 2nd Respondent, in his objections, admitted

these averments and further clarified that 12 years of experience was considered for

applicants with NDT and that NCT cannot be equated with NDT.

A true copy of the purported Board Decision filed by the 1st Respondent before the Human

Rights Commission P29 was submitted to this court by the Petitioners. The Petitioners,

however, state that P29 is not a Board Decision as maintained by the 1st Respondent and

merely a document containing the proposed Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion. The

Petitioners point out that the document carries no indication that the Board of Directors

of the 1st Respondent has approved the said proposed Scheme of Recruitment and

Promotion. The Petitioners further state that the 1st Respondent failed to produce a

certified copy of the purported Board Decision dated 16.08.2010 to the Human Rights

Commission. In the circumstances, the Petitioners state that they verily believe that a

decision to amend the Scheme of Recruitment was not taken.

13

In response, the 2nd Respondent states that the document P29 was consequent to a Board

Decision dated 16.08.2010, a certified extract of which was submitted marked 2R1.

The contents of 2R1 are to the effect that the Board discussed the revision of the Scheme

of Recruitment and Promotion with the General Manager and Deputy General Manager

(Personnel and Administration) and approved to revise the tenure of experience of the

NCT qualified personnel, as shown in the Annexures to the Board Paper when they apply

for the posts of Engineering Assistants Class III-(Board Grade 10) and Engineering

Assistants (Special)- (Board Grade 7) and Engineer Class II (Board Grade 7). The relevant

annexure to 2R1 was submitted later by motion dated 10.02.2016 as the 2nd Respondent

had failed to annex the same, along with the objections.

The Petitioners contend that the document 2R1 submitted by the Respondents purported

to be the Board Decision to amend the Scheme of Recruitment and Promotion is not in a

fit state to be accepted by the Court, stating that it is merely a paragraph printed on scrap

paper with a handwritten date and bearing no signatures of the members of the Board of

Directors or the Secretary of the Board.

The Petitioners state that the inquiry before the Human Rights Commission commenced

on 02.08.2013 and was re-fixed for 16.09.2013. No representations were made on

behalf of the 1st Respondent Board. The Petitioners state that thereafter, at the next date

of inquiry 04.11.2013, an officer of the Personnel Department of the 1st Respondent

Board appeared and admitted that the proposed revisions to the Scheme of Recruitment

and Promotion contained in P29 have not been approved and that the approval of the

Department of Management Services, Director General of Establishments and the then

National Salaries and Cadre commission have not been obtained in respect of the same.

The said officer is said to have further stated that 7 vacancies were available to the post

in question at the time of calling for applications and that at the time of giving evidence

at the inquiry three vacancies were remaining. However, as stated earlier the 2nd

Respondent in his Statement of Objections denied these averments and maintained that

there were only 6 vacancies.

The Petitioners state that these matters were recorded by the inquiring officer of the

Human Rights Commission who advised the said officer of the 1st Respondent Board to

14

settle the matter and report any settlement to the Human Rights Commission within 2

weeks. According to the Petitioners, their complaint was not taken up for inquiry

thereafter and to the best of the Petitioners knowledge, the Human Rights Commission

has not made any further recommendations. The 2nd Respondent states that the matter

was thereafter referred to the Department of Labour.

The Petitioners contend that in terms of the circulars issued by the Ministry of Finance,

the 1st Respondent Board, being a statutory Board, is required to effect all promotions in

terms of the approved Schemes of Recruitment and Promotions and obtain the necessary

approvals from the Department of Management Services and the Treasury. The copies of

Management Services Circulars No. 28 dated 10.04.2006 and 28(II) dated 01.08.2006

were submitted marked P31 and P32. The 2nd Respondent states that the restructuring

of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board commenced in late 2011 under the

supervision of the Department of Management Services and was required to prepare a

new scheme of recruitment. Prior to the said restructuring the then scheme of

recruitment was amended pursuant to Board decisions.

The Petitioners further state that the 1st Respondent has acted contrary to the direction

given by the Attorney General by letter dated November 2011 P33 that all promotions

of the 1st Respondent Board should be made in terms of the approved scheme of

recruitment and by conducting interviews duly. The said letter marked P33 relates to a

settlement reached in SC FR 103/2007 that the Water Board should follow the eligibility

criteria in the Scheme of Recruitment in awarding promotions. In response to this

contention, the 2nd Respondent maintains that the interviews were duly conducted. The

said letter marked P33 states as follows;

,

,

.

Answering the 2nd Respondents statement that no marks were given for the Petitioners

service as they had not met the eligibility criteria, the Petitioners point out that in

paragraph 13 of his objections the 2nd Respondent has admitted that as the new Scheme

15

of Recruitment and Promotion had not come into force, the existing scheme of

recruitment was adopted. Whereas the existing scheme of recruitment required only 12

years of service and the Petitioners were all possessed of more than 12 years of experience

at the closing date of applications, they were eligible for promotion and therefore could

not have been denied marks for service by the Respondents on the basis that the

Petitioners were not eligible.

Furthermore, the Petitioners state that the 2nd Respondents objections are self-

contradictory as the existing scheme of recruitment was adopted since the new scheme

of recruitment had not come into force, but paragraph 14 of the statement of objections,

states that the Petitioners were not eligible for the promotion in terms of the existing

Scheme of Recruitment. Therefore, if the existing Scheme of Recruitment was followed,

as submitted by the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioners would have been eligible as they had

the requisite experience required as per the existing scheme of recruitment. The

Petitioners state that this points to arbitrary action by the Respondents in denying them

marks for service on the basis that they are not eligible.

Moreover, the 2nd Respondent contended that the 1st Petitioner is not eligible to apply as

he does not possess the requisite experience having assumed duties in the post of

Technical Assistant only on 15.05.1996. The 2nd Respondent has not set out the reasons

as to why the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners would be ineligible for promotion to Engineer-Class

II except to state that the next promotion of the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners is to the post of

Engineer Assistant-Special Grade.

The Petitioners point out that the 2nd Respondent has failed to file the purported Board

Decision amending the Scheme of Recruitment and the purported amended Scheme of

Recruitment. At the inquiries before the Human Rights Commission and the Department

of Labour, the Respondents had produced P29 as the purported Board Decision.

Although the 2nd Respondent states that the Petitioners were not eligible for the

promotion, the Petitioners were called for the interview. According to the Petitioners, at

the interview too they had not been informed that they were ineligible. Furthermore, the

1st Petitioner had even been appointed to cover the duties in the post of Electrical

Engineer, as indicated by the documents P10A and P10B and was included in the

16

waiting list. In response to an appeal submitted by the Petitioner dated 10.08.2010

(CA3) seeking to be promoted to the post of Electrical Engineer, the then General

Manager (Personnel) of the 1st Respondent had informed the 1st Petitioner by letter dated

29.09.2010 (CA4) that there were no vacancies for the post of Electrical Engineer and

requested the 1st Petitioner to apply for the post in the next round of promotions. At no

time was the 1st Petitioner informed that he was not eligible for promotion to the

impugned post (vide CA1 and CA2 letters sent by the 1st Respondent Board dated

24.06.2009 and 07.05.2008 respectively calling the 1st Petitioner for interviews for the

post of Electrical Engineer Class II).

Alleged Violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

Applications for the post of Engineer-Class II were called under the purported new

Scheme of Recruitment and not under the existing Scheme of Recruitment (vide P24

letter calling for applications dated 19.03.2012 which requires 17 years of experience

including 3 years experience in the post of Engineer Assistant-Class 1 from those with

the NCT qualification). The 2nd Respondent has taken up contradictory positions in

stating which Scheme of Recruitment was resorted to in selecting the Petitioners for the

interviews for promotion. By paragraph 13 of his statement of objections the 2nd

Respondent has verily accepted that the Scheme of Recruitment resorted to with regard

to the Petitioners was the existing Scheme of Recruitment as the purported new Scheme

of Recruitment had not come into force by then.

As the 2nd Respondent himself has accepted that the existing Scheme of Recruitment was

resorted to regarding the Petitioners, it only remains for this Court to consider whether

the Petitioners were in fact possessed of the requisite eligibility to apply for the post of

Engineer-Class II. The Courts inquiry is made easier by the fact that all three Petitioners

were called for interview by the 1st Respondent Board. The Court is inclined to consider

the said fact as a prima facie indication that the 1st Respondent Board considered the

Petitioners eligible, contrary to the 2nd Respondents contention that the Petitioners were

not eligible to apply. As held by His Lordship Justice Fernandos statement in Abeysinghe

v. Central Engineering and Consultancy Bureau (1996) 2 SLR 36, at page 47 the fact

that he was invited for the interview does suggest that he was, prima facie, suitable

17

regarding a situation where the Petitioners were invited to attend an interview to select

a candidate for appointment as Deputy General Manager of the CECB.

The Petitioners submits that at the round of promotions held in 2009, the 1st Petitioner

was duly awarded marks for his service and included in the waiting list for the post of

Engineer-Class II, which further supports the finding that the 1st Petitioner was eligible

to apply for the said post. Although the Petitioners have not submitted specific proof that

the 1st Petitioner was included in the waiting list, the letter CA3 sent by the 1st Petitioner

to the Chairman of the Water Board dated 10.08.2010 seeking a promotion to the post

of Engineer-Class II mentions that the 1st Petitioner is included in the waiting list. The

said position is not contradicted by the Respondents.

However, the Court is mindful that a candidate who was called for an interview may well

be found unsuitable for the position following the due completion of the interview

process. This could be due to the candidate failing to score the number of marks needed

due to various deficiencies in their suitability. In Abeysinghe v. Central Engineering and

Consultancy Bureau (supra) it was observed that in certain circumstances even a

candidate who possesses the requisite seniority and merit may be overlooked if it is

demonstrated that such candidate does not possess the skills to meet the needs of the

institution and the public.

The principle of promotion by reference to seniority and merit does not mean that the

needs of the Institution and the public, or the demands of the post in question, must be

ignored (see Perera v. Ranatunga (1993) 1 SLR 39) Hence even if he had been given high

marks, nevertheless the decision not to appoint him, to a post for which he was

considered unsuitable, cannot be considered unlawful, unfair or unreasonable.

Therefore, although the Court is convinced that the Petitioners are possessed of the

requisite qualifications to be called for interview, the Court does not hold the

preconception that the Petitioners would score sufficient marks for appointment into the

post of Engineer-Class II. If the Respondents were able to demonstrate that the

Petitioners were found unsuitable consequent to the interview it would have to be

accepted that the Petitioners were indeed unsuitable and were not subjected to unequal

treatment. Except for stating that the Petitioners do not possess the requisite experience

18

for the post, the Respondents have submitted scant justification in support of their

rejection of the Petitioners for the said post, leading to the conclusion that the

Respondents were acting in an unreasonable and arbitrary manner by overlooking the

Petitioners for promotion. Documents that can establish the bona fides of the interview

process such as the mark sheets of the interviews and/or a marking scheme have not

been submitted by the Respondents.

With regard to the period of experience, if the Recommended Marking Scheme marked

P25 was used to evaluate the Petitioners suitability, the 2nd Respondents contention,

that marks were not awarded for the Petitioners period of service, is untenable. It appears

that the period of experience and period of service would mean one and the same when

it comes to internal candidates of the 1st Respondent Water Board such as the Petitioners,

as a specified number of marks are awarded for each year of experience in the respective

posts of Technical Assistant, Engineering Assistant-Class II, Engineering Assistant-

Class I and Engineering Assistant Special Grade with the possibility of earning a

maximum of 50 marks for the period of experience. In that context, each of the

Petitioners stands to earn a considerable number of marks given their service record in

the Water Board, which was mentioned at the outset.

On the other hand, the Petitioners have not adduced evidence to demonstrate that the 7th

to 10th Respondents possessed the same qualifications as the Petitioners, nor any mala

fides on the part of the Respondents. The classification theory requires that a positive act

of unequal treatment among subjects similarly circumstanced should be demonstrated,

if a finding of unequal treatment is to be made. Despite its adoption by a Full Bench in

Elmore Perera v. Montague Jayawickrama (1994) 2 SLR 90, this court has thereafter on

many occasions sought to distance itself from the classification theory, in favour of the

new doctrine formulated in the Indian case of Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu 1974 AIR

SC 555. Relief is now freely granted in respect of arbitrary and mala fide exercise of

executive power.

Although a trend of moving away from the classification theory emerged, the theory is

not so faulty as to be completely discarded, given that it is not applied rigidly to

mandatorily insist on evidence of differential treatment of similarly situate persons in all

19

and every occasion, for a finding of inequal treatment to be made. Having made this

observation, in the present case, we consider it more appropriate to apply the new

doctrine which focuses on whether the impugned act was contrary to the rule of law

and reasonableness. After Shanmugam Sivarajah v. OIC, Terrorist Investigation Division

SC FR 15/2010, (SC Minutes of 27.06.2017), it is now settled that classification is not

the only basis for relief under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. As held by the Court at

p.12,

Rule of Law dictates that every act that is not sanctioned by the law and every act that

violates the law be struck down as illegal. It does not require positive discrimination or

unequal treatment. An act that is prohibited by the law receives no legitimacy merely

because it does not discriminate between people.

In Wickrematunga v. Anuruddha Ratwatte (1998) 1 SLR 201, His Lordship Justice A.R.B.

Amerasinghe held that "Law" in Article 12 of the Constitution includes regulations,

rules, directions, principles, guidelines and schemes that are designed to regulate public

authorities in their conduct. Accordingly, the Scheme of Recruitment in question which

sets out the manner of recruitment for Technical Assistants/Engineering Assistants and

Engineers falls within the umbrella of law and should be followed as it is, without

deviation by the Water Board.

Denying the Petitioners eligibility to apply and receive the promotion to Engineer-Class

II is accordingly, contrary to law and defeats equality before the law. As elaborated in

Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu (supra) From a positivistic point of view, equality is

antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one

belongs to the rule of law in the Republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an

absolute monarch... They require that State action must be based on valid, relevant

principles applicable alike to all similarly situate and must not be guided by any

extraneous or irrelevant considerations because that would be denial of equality

Validity of the Purported New Scheme of Recruitment

It is noteworthy that although the call for applications P24 advertised the eligibility

criteria introduced by the purported revised Scheme of Recruitment, the Respondents

20

were unable to satisfactorily establish that the said Scheme of Recruitment had entered

into force. The purported Board decision 2R1 submitted by the 2nd Respondent appears

to be a single paragraph excerpted from a larger document. As submitted by the

Petitioners as well, the document does not carry a proper date and signature of approval.

Had the document been submitted in its entirety with the requisite features that indicate

authenticity, its validity could have been accepted.

The annexure to 2R1 submitted subsequently by way of a motion is a document seeking

approval to revise the service of experience as 17 years instead of 12 years in the existing

scheme of recruitment. Nowhere in the document is it stated that the recommendation

to revise the tenure of experience of the NCT qualified Engineering Assistants when

applying for the post of Engineer has been approved. Therefore, it cannot be accepted as

evidence of due approval of the purported new Scheme of Recruitment. Furthermore, it

can be seen that P29 the purported Board Decision filed before the Human Rights

Commission by the 1st Respondent Board and submitted to the Court by the Petitioners,

contains the existing scheme and the proposed scheme side-by-side and is not a finalized

revision of the Scheme of Recruitment. Therefore, the Board's Decision to amend the

scheme of recruitment and the amended scheme of recruitment has not been submitted

to the Court in a plausible manner.

Restrictions on the Promotion of Internal Candidates to Engineer-Class II

With regard to the 1st Petitioner, without ambiguity, the next promotion available to him

is to the post of Engineer-Class II as he is in the Engineering Assistant-Special Class. A

perusal of the Scheme of Recruitment P1 indicates that although the 2nd Respondents

contention, that the next promotion of the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners could be only to the

Engineering Assistant (Special) Grade, is incorrect, there are indeed certain restrictions

as to how promotions to Engineer-Class II can be made. Those possessing the NCT

together with 12 years of experience, including 3 years of experience as an Engineering

Assistant-Class I in Board Grade 8, are eligible to apply for the post of post of

Engineering Assistant-Special Class (vide page 20 of P1) as well as to the post of

Engineer-Class II (vide page 10 of P1). However, with regard to the post of Engineer-

Class II internal candidates with a Government Technical Officers 3rd Examination

21

qualification together with experience in the relevant field in the NWSDB would have

priority over candidates with the NCT qualification (per the note on page 10 of P1 and

P24 Letter calling for applications dated 19.03.2012), whereas with regard to the

Engineering Assistant-Special Class there is no such priority explicitly stated.

Furthermore, the note on page 20 of P1 which reads As internal promotions to the

Grade of Engineer have been limited to 25% of the total cadre of Engineer-Cl.II (Board

Gr. 7), Cadre of Engineer Assistant- Special Class is to be kept opened without any

restriction evinces that only 25% of the Engineer-Class II vacancies can be filled with

internal candidates, as submitted by the 2nd Respondent in his objections.

While it is evident that there are certain restrictions placed on the number of internal

candidates that can be promoted to Engineer-Class II, the Respondents have not

indicated that those restrictions were the cause for the Petitioners to be overlooked for

the promotions.

Petitioners Legitimate Expectations

It was contended by the Petitioners that their legitimate expectations were violated by the

Respondents by subjecting the Petitioners to an ad hoc and unsanctioned Scheme of

Recruitment and Promotion. In my opinion, the Petitioners had a legitimate expectation

that the 1st Respondent Board would follow an established practice in the promotion of

the applicants. This is not to state that public authorities cannot change their decisions

or policies, but such changes must not be arbitrary or amount to an abuse of power. As

His Lordship Justice Prasanna Jayawardena held in Ariyarathne and Others v N.K.

Illangakoon (S.C F. R No. 444/2012, S.C Minutes 30.07.2019) at page 56;

As evident from the principles I endeavoured to set out earlier, the first characteristic

which will sustain a petitioners claim that he has a substantive legitimate expectation

the respondent public authority will act in a particular manner with regard to him, is

that the petitioner must establish the public authority gave him a specific, unambiguous

and unqualified assurance that it will act in that manner [or, alternatively, that the

respondent public authority has followed an established and unambiguous practice

which entitled the petitioner to have a legitimate expectation the public authority will

22

continue to act in that manner or that the facts and circumstances of the dealings between

the public authority and the petitioner have created such an expectation].

I am of the view that the Petitioners had a legitimate expectation that the promotions

would be effected as per the approved Scheme of Recruitment and that they would be

granted marks for their period of service. In my opinion, for the reasons stated above, the

Petitioners legitimate expectations are violated.

Conclusion

For the reasons set above, I hold that the fundamental right of the Petitioners guaranteed

by Article 12(1) of the Constitution was violated by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents.

Regrettably, there is a lack of professional display by the Respondents in adhering to the

applicable rules and regulations despite the communication of the Hon. Attorney General

to the 1st Respondent Board way back in 2011. Needless to say, the 1st Respondent Board

should adhere to approved Schemes of Recruitment and Promotions when awarding

promotions. This Court observes that the 1st Respondent Board should firmly adhere to

established schemes of promotion and requirements without subjecting applicants to

arbitrary and ad hoc schemes. In my view, adherence to established schemes of

recruitment and promotions is not a complicated task. Moreover, adherence to

established schemes ensures a content public service as held by His Lordship Justice

Kulatunga in Perera and Another v Cyril Ranatunga, Secretary Defence and Others Sri

L.R 1 (1993) 39 at page 60;

The service of most public officers is life-time and the guarantee of fair treatment to them

enshrined in Article 12 (1) of the Constitution would, if properly enforced, also help in

maintaining a contented public service which is vital for its efficient functioning.

If the 1st Respondent Board is of the view that the Scheme of Retirement and Promotions

should be streamlined, then it should be done in accordance and in compliance with the

established procedure.

In those circumstances, I order the 1st Respondent Board that;

the Petitioners forthwith be appointed to the position of Engineer Class II, in the event

their promotions have not been granted. However if they had been promoted subsequent

23

to the filing of this application, their promotion should be back dated to the date on which

promotions were granted to the 7th to the 10th Respondents to the post of Engineer- class

II. The petitioners however, will not be entitled for any back wages.

We also direct the 1st Respondent Board to pay compensation in a sum of Rupees two

hundred and fifty thousand to each of the Petitioners.
