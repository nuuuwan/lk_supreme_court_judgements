"“Three principles are thus discernible in regard to the operation of
the time limit"
"prescribed by Article 126 (2). Time begins to run when the infringement
takes"
"place;
if knowledge on the part of the petitioner is required (e.g of other instances"
"by
comparison
with
which
the
treatment
meted
out
to
him
becomes"
"discriminatory),
time
begins
to
run
only when
both
in
infringement
and"
"knowledge exist
(Siriwardena v. Rodrigo (2). The pursuit of other remedies,"
"judicial or administrative, does not prevent or interrupt the operation of"
"the time limit.” [emphasis added]"
"According to afore-cited cases,
the Petitioner seeking an administrative remedy"
"by writing
to
the
5th Respondent
does
not
stop
the
running
of
time
as"
"stipulated in Article 126 (2) of
the Constitution. Therefore,
I am of
the opinion"
"that
the
application
of
the
Petitioner
is
time
barred
as
it was
filed
on"
"20.12.2012 which is more than three months after the alleged violation."
"For
the reasons set out above,
I conclude that
the Petitioners application is"
"time
barred
under
Article
126
(2)
of
the Constitution
thus,
the
same
is"
"misconceived in law"
"On the basis of the aforesaid findings, the Application is hereby dismissed."
