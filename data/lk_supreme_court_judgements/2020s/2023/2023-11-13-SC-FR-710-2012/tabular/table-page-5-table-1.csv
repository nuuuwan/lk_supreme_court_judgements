"According
to
the
Petitioner,
the
1st
Respondent
has
telephoned
the
4th"
"Respondent during the tender board meeting and informed him that the tender"
"will be granted to him. Aggrieved by this the Petitioner has sent a letter (P3) to"
"the
5th Respondent
complaining
to him about
the
aforesaid
incident
and"
"requested that
the tender be awarded to him. The 5th Respondent responded"

"Respondent
and his
father
to withdraw the
tender. Upon the Respondent’s"
"refusal
to do so,
the Petitioner had left
the vehicle presumably to attend the"
"tender opening at
the Divisional Secretariat Office while the 4th Respondent"
"and his father were detained forcibly to prevent them from attending the same."
