"that an application is out of
time,
the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain such"
"application.”"
"In Demuni Sriyani de Soyza and others v. Dharmasena Dissanayake, SC"
"206/2008 (F/R), SC Minutes of 09.12.2016, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena"
"PC held at page 8 that,"
"“Article 126 (2) of
the Constitution stipulates that, a person who alleges that any"
"of his fundamental
rights have been infringed or are about
to be infringed by"
"executive or administrative action may “….. within one month thereof ….. “ apply"
"to this Court by way of a Petition praying for relief or redress in respect of such"
"infringement. The
consequence
of
this
stipulation in Article 126 (2)
is that, a"
"Petition which is filed after the expiry of a period of one month from the time the"
"alleged infringement occurred, will be time barred and unmaintainable. This rule"
"is so well known that it hardly needs to be stated here."
"The rule that, an application under Article 126 which has not been filed within"
"one month
of
the
occurrence
of
the
alleged
infringement will make
that"
"application unmaintainable, has been enunciated time and again from the time"
"this Court exercised the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction conferred upon it by the"
"1978 Constitution.”"
"In the present case,
the 1st Respondent has announced his decision to award"
"the tender to the 4th Respondent on the day the Tenders were open, which was"
"on
11.09.2012
in
the
presence
of
everyone,
including
the
Petitioner."
"Subsequently,
the Petitioner on 13.09.2012 has written a letter (marked P3) to"
"the 5th Respondent complaining about the incident and requesting to grant the"
"tender to him."
"The Petitioner’s position is that he became aware of
the granting of
the tender"
"to 4th Respondent only when he received the letter marked P4 on 20.11.2012"
