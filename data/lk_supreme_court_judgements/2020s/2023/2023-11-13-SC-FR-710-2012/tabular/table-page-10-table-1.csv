"in reply to his letter marked P3. However, in the said letter marked P3 supports"
"the
position
of
the Respondent
that
the
Petitioner was
aware
of
the
said"
"decision."
"Moreover, clause 10 of
the Gazette marked P1 states that if the toddy tender in"
"question was
not
awarded
on
11.09.2012,
the
tender will
be
resold
on"
"06.11.2012 at 10.30 am. Nevertheless,
there were no steps taken for resale of"
"the
impugned toddy
tender
on the
said date. This
further affirms
that
the"
"tender was already awarded to the 4th Respondent on 11.09.2012 and even if"
"the Petitioner was not aware of that on 11.09.2012, he should have been aware"
"by 06.11.2012 as there was no resale as stipulated by the said Gazette."
"However,
the Petitioner has filed this application on 20.12.2012 after the expiry"
"of one month (which is more than three months after the alleged violation)."
"Furthermore,
in Siriwardena and Others v. Brigadier J. Rodrigo and Others"
"(1986) 1 Sri.L.R. 384, Justice Ranasinghe held at page 385 that,"
"“An application must be filed within one month from the date of
the commission"
"of
the
administrative
or
executive
act
which
is
alleged
constitutes
the"
"infringement or imminent
infringement of
the fundamental right relied on. Where,"
"however, a petitioner
establishes he
became aware
of
such infringement
or"
"imminent
infringement
only on a later date,
the one month will
run from that"
"date. The petitioners had filed their application long after the expiry of one month"
"from the date they became aware of the infringement. Hence the application was"
"out of time.”"
"Similarly,
in Gamaethige v. Siriwardena and Others (1988) 1 Sri.L.R. 384,"
"where the Petitioner has sent
letters to the Director of Establishments and the"
"Secretary
of
the Ministry
of
Public
Administration
complaining
about
the"
"violation of his fundamental rights,
it was held at page 402 that,"
