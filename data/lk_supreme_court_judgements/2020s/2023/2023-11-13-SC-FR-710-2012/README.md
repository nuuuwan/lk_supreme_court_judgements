K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J

This is an Application filed under Article 126(1) of the Constitution by the

Petitioner seeking, inter alia, for a declaration that their fundamental rights to

equality before the law and equal protection of the law as guaranteed by Article

12(1) of the Constitution has been violated as a result of the arbitrary,

capricious and/or irrational action of the Respondents.

On12thDecember 2012, having heard the Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner in support of this Application and the Learned ASG and the

Presidents Counsel who appeared for the Respondents, this court granted

leave to proceed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution for the alleged violation

of the said fundamental right by the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

ThePetitionercarriedonthebusinessofrunningatoddytavernat

Madampitiya, Colombo 15 and he was awarded the tender to sell toddy at the

Madampitiya toddy tavern, Colombo 15 for the period of 01.01.2012 to

31.12.2012. The 1st Respondent who is the Divisional Secretary of Colombo

published the Gazette bearing No.1773 on 24.08.2012 (P1) for the sale of the

right to sell toddy at the aforesaid toddy tavern for the period starting from 1st

January 2013 to 31st of December of 2013 and annually tenders are invited

from the prospective bidders in terms of the Gazette No.207 dated 20.08.1982

(P2). The Petitioner in accordance with the aforesaid Gazette submitted a

tender for a sum of Rs. 1, 500, 000.00 on 11.09.2012.

The tenders for the sale of the right to sell toddy at the aforesaid toddy tavern

was opened on 11.09.2012 and apart from this tender there had been another

tender for a sum of Rs. 2, 500, 000.00 submitted by the 4th Respondent. At

the opening of the tender, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents, the Clerk of the

Colombo Divisional Secretariat, one R.P.G Piyatissa and the Petitioner were

present while the 4th Respondent failed to be present.

4

According to the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent has telephoned the 4th

Respondent during the tender board meeting and informed him that the tender

will be granted to him. Aggrieved by this the Petitioner has sent a letter (P3) to

the 5th Respondent complaining to him about the aforesaid incident and

requested that the tender be awarded to him. The 5th Respondent responded

by a letter dated 16.11.2012 (P4A) stating that since the 1st Respondent is the

Chairman of the Tender Board the 5th Respondent is unable to take any

actions against him and advising him to take legal action if any injustice has

been caused. Upon receiving this letter the Petitioner has inquired about the

same from the Colombo Divisional Secretariat and from the office of the 5th

Respondent and he was informed that the tender had been granted to the 4th

Respondents.

The Petitioners position is that the Gazette marked P1 requires the presence of

the tenderer at the time of opening the tender and the award of the tender to

the 4th Respondent is illegal and unlawful as the 4th Respondent was absent

at that specific time.

According to the 4th Respondent he and his father were forcibly taken by some

unknown persons to a vehicle (Nissan Vanette Van, White in Colour) parked

outside the Divisional Secretariat Office when they were waiting outside the

office to be invited to attend the opening of the tender on 11.09.2012 at about

10.00am. The 4th Respondents states that the Petitioner who was not known

to him at that time was also inside the said vehicle and they threatened the 4th

Respondent and his father to withdraw the tender. Upon the Respondents

refusal to do so, the Petitioner had left the vehicle presumably to attend the

tender opening at the Divisional Secretariat Office while the 4th Respondent

and his father were detained forcibly to prevent them from attending the same.

The 4th Respondent states that those unknown persons threatened to cause

5

harm if they attempted to leave the vehicle and they were driven away in that

vehicle and dropped off in Kiribathgoda.

The 1st Respondent states that he was informed that the handing of the tender

closed on the same day which was 11.09.2012 and that the 4th Respondent

had been present at that time. Nevertheless, the Petitioner has informed him

that the 4th Respondent was not present and that he left the premises since he

was not pursuing his tender. The Petitioner has told that the 1st Respondent

can talk to the 4th Respondent to confirm the same. Having dialed a number,

the Petitioner has given his mobile phone to the 1st Respondent. The 4th

Respondent who was at the other end has told the 1st Respondent that the

Petitioner had intimidated him and chased him away and yet, he was pursuing

his claim for the award of the tender. The 1st Respondent has then announced

that the tender will be granted to the 4th Respondent.

According to both the 1st and 4th Respondents, the Gazette marked P1 does

not require the presence of the tenderer at the time of opening the tender. The

relevant conditions of the Gazette marked P1 in this regard are as follows.

03.

........... - "

- () ,

()

.

.

04. ,

,

.

6

According to the above, the presence of the tenderers are required only when

they are closing the acceptance of tenders and not at the time of the opening of

the tenders.

Further, the condition 07 of the said Gazette marked P1 states that,

.

The condition 9 of the Gazette marked P2 also states that,

The Powers of Acceptance or Rejection of Tenders-

(1) The Government Agent may, in his discretion, accept any tender received.

(2) The Government Agent may,in his discretion, reject any or all of the

tenders received

It is evident from the above that the complete discretion over the tender lies

with the Divisional Secretary. In the present case, the 1st Respondent who is

the Divisional Secretary has awarded the tender to the 4th Respondent by

considering the fact that the tender submitted by him was Rs. 300, 000.00 in

excess of the threshold price fixed by the Excise Department (Rs. 2, 200,

000.00) while the tender of the Petitioner fell short of the threshold price by Rs.

700, 000.00.

Therefore, the actions of the 1st Respondent cannot be considered as arbitrary

and unlawful as he has acted according to the Gazette in the best interest of

the State.

Furthermore, the Respondents of the present action have contended that the

Petitioners application has been filed out of time. Although this court has

7

decided on 21.12.2012 that the application was filed within the mandatory

time limit ofone month, this cannot be taken as conclusive as the case was

supported ex parte on that day without notice to any of the Respondents. By

the journal entry dated 01.07.2014, this court has granted permission to the

Respondents to file preliminary objections on time bar before 08.08.2014 and

on 19.08.2014, this court has granted further two weeks time to the 4th

Respondent to file written submission on the preliminary objections. The 4th

Respondent has filed his written submission on 22.08.2014 and 1st, 2nd, 3rd,

5th and 6th Respondents have filed their written submissions on 11.09.2014.

In all of those submissions, the Respondents have raised the preliminary

objection that the Petitioners application has been filed out of time under

Article 126 (2) of the Constitution and therefore, the matter must be dismissed

in limine. According to Article 126 (2) of the Constitution,

Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language right

relating to such person has been infringed or is about to be infringed by executive

or administrative action, he may himself or by an Attorney-at-Law on his behalf,

within one month thereof, in accordance with such rules of court as may be in

force, apply to the Supreme Court by way of petition in writing addressed to such

Courtpraying forrelief or redress in respect of such infringement. Such

application may be proceeded with only with leave to proceed first and obtained

from the Supreme Court, which leave may be granted or refused, as the case

may be, by not less than two judges.

In the case of Ilangaratne vs. Kandy Municipal Council [1995] BALJ Vol.VI

Part 1 at p.10, his Lordship Justice Kulatunga observed that,

the result of the express stipulation of a one month time limit in Article 126(2) is

that, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application which is filed out of

time ie: after the expiry of one month from the occurrence of the alleged

infringement or imminent infringement which is complained of,. . if it is clear

8

that an application is out of time, the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain such

application.

In Demuni Sriyani de Soyza and others v. Dharmasena Dissanayake, SC

206/2008 (F/R), SC Minutes of 09.12.2016, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena

PC held at page 8 that,

Article 126 (2) of the Constitution stipulates that, a person who alleges that any

of his fundamental rights have been infringed or are about to be infringed by

executive or administrative action may .. within one month thereof .. apply

to this Court by way of a Petition praying for relief or redress in respect of such

infringement. The consequence of this stipulation in Article 126 (2) is that, a

Petition which is filed after the expiry of a period of one month from the time the

alleged infringement occurred, will be time barred and unmaintainable. This rule

is so well known that it hardly needs to be stated here.

The rule that, an application under Article 126 which has not been filed within

one month ofthe occurrence ofthe alleged infringementwill make that

application unmaintainable, has been enunciated time and again from the time

this Court exercised the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction conferred upon it by the

1978 Constitution.

In the present case, the 1st Respondent has announced his decision to award

the tender to the 4th Respondent on the day the Tenders were open, which was

on11.09.2012inthepresenceofeveryone,includingthePetitioner.

Subsequently, the Petitioner on 13.09.2012 has written a letter (marked P3) to

the 5th Respondent complaining about the incident and requesting to grant the

tender to him.

The Petitioners position is that he became aware of the granting of the tender

to 4th Respondent only when he received the letter marked P4 on 20.11.2012

9

in reply to his letter marked P3. However, in the said letter marked P3 supports

the position of the Respondent that the Petitioner was aware of the said

decision.

Moreover, clause 10 of the Gazette marked P1 states that if the toddy tender in

question was not awarded on 11.09.2012, the tender will be resold on

06.11.2012 at 10.30 am. Nevertheless, there were no steps taken for resale of

the impugned toddy tender on the said date. This further affirms that the

tender was already awarded to the 4th Respondent on 11.09.2012 and even if

the Petitioner was not aware of that on 11.09.2012, he should have been aware

by 06.11.2012 as there was no resale as stipulated by the said Gazette.

However, the Petitioner has filed this application on 20.12.2012 after the expiry

of one month (which is more than three months after the alleged violation).

Furthermore, in Siriwardena and Others v. Brigadier J. Rodrigo and Others

(1986) 1 Sri.L.R. 384, Justice Ranasinghe held at page 385 that,

An application must be filed within one month from the date of the commission

oftheadministrativeorexecutiveactwhichisallegedconstitutesthe

infringement or imminent infringement of the fundamental right relied on. Where,

however, a petitioner establishes he became aware of such infringement or

imminent infringement only on a later date, the one month will run from that

date. The petitioners had filed their application long after the expiry of one month

from the date they became aware of the infringement. Hence the application was

out of time.

Similarly, in Gamaethige v. Siriwardena and Others (1988) 1 Sri.L.R. 384,where the Petitioner has sent letters to the Director of Establishments and theSecretary of the Ministry of Public Administration complaining about theviolation of his fundamental rights, it was held at page 402 that,

10

Three principles are thus discernible in regard to the operation of the time limitprescribed by Article 126 (2). Time begins to run when the infringement takesplace; if knowledge on the part of the petitioner is required (e.g of other instancesbycomparisonwithwhichthetreatmentmetedouttohimbecomesdiscriminatory),timebeginsto run only when both in infringementandknowledge exist (Siriwardena v. Rodrigo (2). The pursuit of other remedies,judicial or administrative, does not prevent or interrupt the operation ofthe time limit. [emphasis added]

According to afore-cited cases, the Petitioner seeking an administrative remedyby writing to the 5th Respondent does not stop the running of time asstipulated in Article 126 (2) of the Constitution. Therefore, I am of the opinionthat the application of the Petitioner is time barred as it was filed on20.12.2012 which is more than three months after the alleged violation.

For the reasons set out above, I conclude that the Petitioners application istime barred under Article 126 (2) of the Constitution thus, the same ismisconceived in law

On the basis of the aforesaid findings, the Application is hereby dismissed.
