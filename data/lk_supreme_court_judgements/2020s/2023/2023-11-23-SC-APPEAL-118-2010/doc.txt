DECIDED ON: 23rd November 2023.

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The 3rd Accused-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant)

preferred this appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Badulla (hereinafter

referred to as the High Court) dated 15th July 2010. The matter was taken up for

Argument on 16th May 2023, and the Counsel for the Appellant submitted that he will

be confining this appeal to two questions of law stated as follows:

(i) Whether the evidence of witnesses was led contrary to Section

192 of the Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979?

(ii) Whether all Accused were acquitted on Counts No. 2, 3 and 4,

and can the Appellant be convicted on Count No.1, namely under

Section 140 of the Penal Code?

I find it pertinent to set out the material facts of the case prior to addressing the

question of law before us.

The 3rd Accused-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) and

two others were charged in the Magistrates Court of Badulla on four counts, namely,

1. At Mahathanna Division, Kandegedara within the jurisdiction of this

court on 23rd December 1999 you being a member of an unlawful

assembly with the common intention of causing unjust harm or other

criminal act to Marimuttu Tirruppan of No. 13/1, Mhathenna Division,

Sarniya Estate, Kandegedara committed an offence punishable under

Section 140 of the Penal Code.

2. In the same transaction you with some other people being members

of the unlawful assembly described in charge 1 to carry out the

common intention or intentions of the said unlawful assembly did

SC APPEAL 118/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 5 of 13

cause hurt by assaulting with hands, stones and sticks and thereby

committed an offence punishable under Section 146 of the Penal

Code.

3. In the same transaction you did commit robbery of the properties

worth Rs. 92700/- belonging to Marimuttu Tirupathy and thereby

committed an offence punishable under Section 382 read with

Section 146 of the Penal Code.

4. In the same transaction you with the common intention of causing

unjust harm or loss to the properties of Marimuttu Thirupathy and

knowing the same will happen did pelt stones to the house of

Marimuttu Thirupathy and thereby committed mischief to the

properties of the said house worth Rs. 500/- an offence punishable

under Section 140 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code.

The 1st and 2nd Accused and the Appellant pleaded not guilty, and the case proceeded

to trial. On 18th September 2002, the prosecution concluded the evidence in chief of

prosecution witness No. 1 Marimuttu Murugayya. In giving evidence the witness stated

that, on 23rd December 1999 the 1st and 2nd Accused and the Appellant arrived at his

house with several others and attacked his house with clubs; that he ran outside and

hid in the vegetable plot and watched the activities of the mob; that he identified the

1st and 2nd Accused and the Appellant as they were previously known to him; that after

the crowd left he went inside the house and realised that some jewellery and few

household items were missing; and that he informed the police that night itself and

the police arrived and commenced investigations. On this day of the trial, the 1st and

2nd Accused and the Appellant were present and represented and moved for a date to

cross-examine the witness. As a result, Court re-fixed the matter for cross-examination

and further trial was on 22nd January 2003.

When this case was called on 22nd January 2003 for trial, only the 1st Accused was

present in court, and the 2nd Accused and the Appellant were absent, and as such,

SC APPEAL 118/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 13

warrants were issued on them, and their sureties were noticed. The matter was re-fixed

for trial on 2nd December 2003 and then again on 24th February 2004. However, on 24th

February 2004, the 2nd Accused and the Appellant were absent again, and warrants

were re-issued.

On 27th February 2004, the Appellant appeared in court and got the warrant recalled.

However, as the 2nd Accused was absent, the matter was fixed for steps under Section

192 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act on 13th July 2004. On 13th July 2004, the 1st

Accused and Appellant appeared in Court and were represented. The police had led

evidence under Section 192(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code and had informed the

court that the 2nd Accused was not found in his village, and the same was confirmed

by the Gramasevaka of the said village. After this evidence was led, the court permitted

evidence to be led in the absence of the 2nd Accused, and the matter was fixed for trial

on 9th December 2004.

On 9th December 2004, only the 1st Accused was present before the Court, and the

Appellant was absent. Court observed that although the Appellant was present before

the Court on 27th February 2004, he had been absent on 22nd January 2003, 24th

February 2004 and 9th of December 2004. Therefore, the learned Magistrate issued a

warrant on the Appellant and his sureties were noticed of the same. The matter was

re-fixed to be tried on 21st April 2005, and on that date, too, only the 1st Accused had

appeared, and the Appellant had neither been present nor represented. Therefore, the

learned Magistrate had decided to proceed against the Appellant in absentia as

provided under S.192(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

After making this observation, the Learned Magistrate had called witness No. 1, and

he had been cross-examined by the counsel for the 1st Accused. On the same day,

witness No. 2 had given evidence, and he had identified the 2nd Accused as a person

who came and mobbed Marimuttu's house. The trial had been concluded on this day

with the evidence of witness No. 9, who was a police officer. The case was then fixed

for judgment on 23rd June 2005. On 23rd June 2005, the case was re-fixed for judgment

SC APPEAL 118/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 13

on 02nd September 2005. On 02nd September 2005, only the 1st Accused was present

and the matter was re-fixed for judgment on 18th November 2005. However, as the

Presidential Election was held on 18th November 2005, the case was not called on the

said day and was called again on 25th November 2005 and fixed for judgment on 10th

February 2006. The matter was called against on 10th February 2006, and the judgment

was pronounced: the 1st and 2nd Accused and the Appellant were convicted for all 4

counts. On this day also, the 2nd Accused and Appellant were absent and

unrepresented. The matter was called again on 10th March 2006 and on 21st April 2006

for sentencing, but still, the 2nd Accused and the Appellant were absent and

unrepresented on all of these days. Since the 2nd Accused and the Appellant were

absent court issued warrants on them. After these days, this matter was called on

several days, namely, 25th April 2006, 30th May 2006, 25th July 2006, 30th July 2006, 11th

August 2006, 15th August 2006 and 12th September 2006, but no application was made

on behalf of the Appellant.

On 26th September 2006, the 1st and 2nd Accused and the Appellant were present in

court, and an application was made under Section 192 (2) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act. The counsel informed Court that the Appellant came to Court on 18th

November 2005 and as the case was not taken up due to the Presidential Election

being held, he had no notice of the next date of this case. He had stated that on 29th

November 2005, the case had been taken up for trial in the absence of his client.

Having heard this application, the learned Judge had fixed the matter for order on the

said application and for sentencing on 28th November 2006. On this day, the 1st and

2nd Accused and the Appellant were present in Court, and the matter was re-fixed for

sentencing on 30th January 2007. The 1st and 2nd Accused and the Appellant were

absent on 30th January 2007, and the learned Magistrate, who had been specially

appointed by the Judicial Services Commission to sentence the 1st and 2nd Accused

and the Appellant, had observed their absence, and had proceeded to convict all three

Accused on each count in the following manner. For the first count, imposed a

SC APPEAL 118/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 13

sentence of 6 months Rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 1500/- and in default

of the said payment, 6 months Rigorous Imprisonment. For the second count, imposed

a sentence of 6 months Rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 1500/- and in default

of the said payment, 6 months Rigorous Imprisonment. For the third count, imposed

a sentence of 24 months Rigorous imprisonment for each accused with a fine of Rs.

1500/- and in default of the said payment, 6 months Rigorous Imprisonment. In

addition to the above, directed to pay a compensation of Rs. 100,000/- to the victim

by each Accused and in default of the said payment, 6 months Rigorous Imprisonment.

For the fourth count, imposed a sentence of 6 months Rigorous imprisonment with a

fine of Rs. 1500/- and in default of the said payment, 6 months Rigorous Imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant appealed to the

Provincial High Court of the Uva Province holden at Badulla. The Learned High Court

Judge, having considered the said appeal, delivered her judgment on 15th July 2010.

The High Court judgment set aside the convictions and sentence imposed on the

Appellant on charges 2, 3 and 4 but affirmed the conviction and sentence imposed on

Count 1 and suspended the term of imprisonment imposed on Count 1 for five years.

Subject to this variation, the appeal of the Appellant was dismissed.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Learned High Court Judge, the Appellant

filed a Leave to Appeal application, and this Court granted Leave to Appeal on 16th

September 2010. As mentioned above, the first question of law is as follows: whether

the evidence of witnesses was led contrary to Section 192 of the Criminal Procedure

Act. Section 192(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 reads as

follows:

Section 192 (1) Where the accused-

(a) is absconding or has left the island; or

(b) is unable to attend or remain in court by reason of illness

and either had consented to the commencement or continuance

SC APPEAL 118/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 13

of the trial in his absence of such trial may commence and

proceed or continue in his absence without prejudice to him; or

(c) by reason of his conduct in court is obstructing or impeding

the progress of the trial, the Magistrate may, if satisfied of

these facts, commence and proceed with the trial in the absence

of the accused.

(Emphasis added)

In the present case, the Appellant was present at the initial stage in Court when the

trial proceeded against him but was absent during the latter stages of the trial.

Therefore, the relevant part of the provision is Section 192 (1)(a) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. This Section only requires the learned Magistrate to be

satisfied with the situation and it does not specify the course of action that must be

adopted by the Magistrate to satisfy himself. This Section has given the discretion to

the Magistrate to proceed with the trial if he is satisfied that the accused is absconding.

As discussed earlier, in the present case, the Appellant was present at the time of the

trial commenced on 18th September 2002. After the evidence in chief of PW1

concluded, the Counsel for the Appellant had moved for a date for cross-examination

and based on this application Court re-fixed the matter for cross-examination on 22nd

January 2003. However, on this date and on several subsequent dates, namely 2nd

December 2003, 24th February 2004 and 9th December 2004, the Appellant was absent

and unrepresented. On 21st April 2005, the learned Magistrate had proceeded on the

basis that the Appellant was knowingly absconding and observed (page 124 of the

appeal brief) as follows;

"3

SC APPEAL 118/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 13

192(1)

.

. 1999

.

An approximate translation would read as follows;

The 3rd Accused has avoided appearing in court today. He has missed

Court on several occasions before. I have observed that the 3rd Accused

has avoided the Court by not appearing today too, which is the last

day of hearing. Therefore, I allow the prosecution to adduce evidence

against him without him as per the provisions of 192(1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. This case is a very old case in this court. This

case is also a case assigned in 1999.

Section 192 is there to proceed in the absence of an accused, and it empowers the

Magistrate to continue the trial in the absence of an accused. If the Magistrate is

satisfied that the accused is absconding, Section 192, as discussed earlier, empowers

the Magistrate to commence and proceed with the trial in the absence of the accused.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submits that, there was no inquiry was held

under Section 192(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act therefore, in terms of the

law, the learned Magistrate had caused a fundamental error by this. I am of the view

that although an inquiry was not held under Section 192(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, a determination was made under the said section. There were sufficient

reasons for the Learned Magistrate to satisfy himself that the Appellant was

absconding from the Court Proceedings for a considerable period of time. Further, as

I observed, the Appellant was present before the learned Magistrate on 6th April 2001,

and from 17th July 2001, he was absent in several instances and not represented by an

Attorney-at-Law. Section 192(1) procedure is applicable to those suspects/accused

who did not have prior knowledge about the next dates and/or steps of the Court

SC APPEAL 118/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 11 of 13

proceedings. I am of the view that due to the abovementioned facts, the Appellant

possessed prior knowledge of the next dates and/or steps of the Court proceedings.

Further, as he was occasionally present before the Court, the Appellant is not entitled

to claim any relief under section 192 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

The second question of law in this matter is, whether all Accused were acquitted on

Count No. 2, 3 and 4 and can the Appellant be convicted on Count No.1, namely under

Section 140 of the Penal Code. The learned High Court Judge, in her judgment, stated

that there was no evidence to prove charges 3 and 4 with regard to the Appellant. The

learned High Court Judge also stated that the second charge was defective. On those

grounds, the learned High Court Judge has acquitted the Appellant on charges 2, 3

and 4. The only charge which was affirmed was the first charge, which was a charge of

unlawful assembly. Section 138 of the Penal Code defines unlawful assembly while the

substantive offence of being a member of an unlawful assembly is constituted by

Section 139, the punishment for this offence is prescribed by Section 140.

As it was submitted in the present case, the learned High Court Judge has set aside

the conviction of the 3rd and 4th counts of the Appellant, mainly based on the statement

of evidence of the two main eyewitnesses namely Marimuttu Murugayya (P.W.1) and

Muththusamy Sundaram (P.W.2) that, the Appellant arrived at the scene of the crime

but have failed to clearly describe the individual acts they committed. But, witness

Marimuththu Murugayya (P.W.1) in his evidence clearly stated that a mob had attacked

the house and he was able to identify only three accused out of the others, and among

them the Appellant (Gunathilake) was there, stated as follows;

.

. 4,5

An approximate translation would read as follows;

Mr. Sumit and Mr. Gunathilaka came down. Others had their faces

tied with black bands. 4,5 people boarded my house. Then I closed the

door. I didn't open the door. They knocked on the door and beat with

sticks. Then came from behind. All the windows were broken. The

group shouted from the front. That the door was broken... The people

who attacked my house are in court today. Chandare is the first one,

Sumith is the second one, they both came inside. The third is

Gunathilake.

Unlawful assembly is a legal term to describe a group of people, five or more, with the

common object of deliberate disturbance of the peace. All the members of an unlawful

assembly are liable to acts of any member in furtherance of a common object. In terms

of Section 138 and Section 140 of the Penal Code, the prosecution has to prove the

presence of a common object. The concept of common object may apply to two or

more persons, and by definition, an unlawful assembly should have been formed for

one or more of the six purposes enumerated in section 138. One can define a "common

object" as the shared intention entertained by each of the members of an unlawful

assembly, and the existence of this intention is sufficient for the purpose of section

146. Further, in the context of a common object, it is sufficient that each accused

person joined the unlawful assembly with knowledge of its character and objects, even

though no further act was done by some of them. Furthermore, the offence envisaged

by section 146 is one committed in the prosecution of the common object of the

assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed

in the prosecution of the common object of the assembly.

SC APPEAL 118/2010 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 13

With the above understandings, I am of the view that Section 140 of the Penal Code

only requires the presence of a common object. Hence, for the above reasons, I answer

the first and second questions of law negatively.

Decision

After careful consideration of the submissions made, facts and circumstances of the

instant case as discussed above, there is no basis to interfere with the decision of the

learned Provincial High Court Judge of the Uva Province holden at Badulla. I hereby

dismiss this Appeal, by answering the first and second questions of law negatively. I

affirm the judgment of the Provincial High Court of the Uva Province holden at Badulla

dated 15th July 2010.

Appeal Dismissed.
