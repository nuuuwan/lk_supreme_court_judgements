Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Kuliyapitiya naming

10 defendants as parties to partition the land described in the schedule

to the plaint among them. The 11th-14th defendants were added later. All

the parties are members of the same family, except for the 13th defendant

(Land Reform Commission) and the 14th defendant (Divisional Secretary

of Udubaddawa). The 13th defendant filed a statement of claim seeking

dismissal of the action on the basis that the land had been vested in the

Land Reform Commission by operation of law and was conveyed to the

14th defendant. What the 13th defendant meant by alleging such

conveyance is not clear. There is no deed of transfer or other document

before Court to that effect.

At the trial, the Preliminary Plan was marked X and the 13th defendants

Plan 13V1. Both Plans were prepared by the same Court Commissioner

and both were tendered by the plaintiff (page 153 of the brief). Both Plans

depict parts of Final Village Plan No. 2022. The Preliminary Plan depicts

a part of Lot 75 in Final Village Plan No. 2022 and Plan 13V1 depicts

parts of Lot 235 in the same Final Village Plan. Lot 1 in Preliminary Plan

X is Lot 1 in Plan 13V1. The extracts of Lots 52 and 75 in Final Village

Plan No. 2022 were marked 7V3. The Court Commissioner was not called

to give evidence by the plaintiff or defendants or Court.

7

SC/APPEAL/89/2011

It seems that the land depicted in the Preliminary Plan is State land/Land

Reform Commission land. This is made clear from the evidence of the

plaintiff. The plaintiffs pedigree commences from his father, namely Pina.

The Plaintiff says his father was the original owner of the land but he

does not know how his father obtained title to the land (page 162 of the

brief). He also says his father did not live on the land. The defendants are

the wife and seven children of Pina. Can a partition action be maintained

on such a pedigree? In my view, it cannot.

At the trial, two deeds were marked. Deed No. 4260 dated 16.01.1992

(P1) executed two weeks before the institution of the partition action

whereby the plaintiffs mother has transferred 1/7 share to the plaintiff,

and deed No. 1929 dated 01.07.1991 (7V1) executed about seven months

before the institution of the partition action whereby a sister of the

plaintiff has transferred 1/7 share to her two children. Title is claimed on

inheritance, not by prescription. This is perhaps because a claim of

prescription requires adverse possession and the plaintiff would be

required to identify the owner against whom he and his siblings

maintained adverse possession. The deeds P1 and 7V1 have not been

produced to the District Court and were not available in the case record

when the District Judge wrote the judgment. The learned District Judge,

without calling for the marked documents prior to writing the judgment,

makes a bare reference only to the deed 7V1 and disregards that deed

stating it was executed shortly before the institution of the action. There

is no mention of P1. I find that those deeds have been produced to the

High Court for the first time. The learned District Judge says the right of

inheritance to the land by Pina and upon his death by his heirs, has not

been disproved by the 13th and 14th defendants by acceptable evidence.

But there is no proof that Pina was the owner of the land by inheritance

in the first place.

brief).

The District Judge has decided to partition the land on the basis that the

13th and 14th defendants did not lead evidence to contradict the evidence

of the plaintiff. But counsel for the 13th defendant raised issues and

cross-examined the witnesses.

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kurunagala dismissed the

13th defendants appeal upholding the preliminary objection raised by

counsel for the plaintiff and the 7th defendant that the 13th defendant has

no locus standi to prefer an appeal against the judgment of the District

Court in view the position taken by the 13th defendant in the statement

of claim that the land subject to partition was vested in the 13th defendant

and later transferred to the 14th defendant. The High Court did not

consider the merits of the appeal.

The procedure adopted by the learned District Judge and the learned

High Court Judge is completely obnoxious to the well-established

principles of law governing partition actions. A partition trial is not an

inter partes trial between the plaintiff on the one hand and the defendants

on the other. It is an action in rem. The decree entered in a partition

action binds not only parties to the action but also non-parties who may

have had interests in the land. For practical purposes, there are no

permanent plaintiffs and defendants in a partition case in that all parties

play a dual role of plaintiff and defendant at different stages of the case.

Vide inter alia sections 19(2) and 70 of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977.

9

SC/APPEAL/89/2011

The defendant today can be the plaintiff tomorrow to prosecute the

partition action to a finality. The judgment in a partition action is the

collective effort of the plaintiffs, the defendants and the District Judge.

Hence there is a special sanctity attached to a partition decree.

However, this does not mean that in a partition action the burden is on

the District Judge to successfully prosecute the case on behalf of the

parties whilst the parties take no interest in the case. There is no such

obligation. The District Judge need not go after the parties pleading with

them in earnest for help to identify the land and then investigate title to

the land. Vide Priyanthi v. Gamage Uma (SC/APPEAL/2/2019, SC

Minutes of 15.10.2021). Having emphasised this in no uncertain terms,

I must also underscore that the overall duty cast upon the District Judge

in hearing a partition action is greater than in an ordinary civil action.

Section 25(1) of the Partition Law reads as follows:

On the date fixed for the trial of a partition action or on any other

date to which the trial may be postponed or adjourned, the court

shall examine the title of each party and shall hear and receive

evidence in support thereof and shall try and determine all questions

of law and fact arising in that action in regard to the right, share, or

interest of each party to, of, or in the land to which the action relates,

and shall consider and decide which of the orders mentioned in

section 26 should be made.

This section mandates a District Judge trying a partition action to

examine the title of each party to the land to be partitioned. He must do

this quite independently of what the parties may or may not say. This is

the fundamental difference between the duty of a Judge trying a partition

action and any other civil action. This is because of the binding nature of

partition actions as actions in rem.

10

SC/APPEAL/89/2011

The duty of the Judge is not perfunctory. A District Judge trying a

partition action cannot be found fault with for being overly cautious or

jealous in investigating title to the land and looking beyond what has

been presented before the Court by way of pleadings, evidence or

otherwise, in order to be absolutely satisfied inter alia that all the

necessary parties are before Court and there is no collusion among the

parties. This paramount duty cast upon the District Judge in partition

actions has been repeatedly stressed by the superior Courts from time

immemorial.

In Peris v. Perera decided 123 years ago and reported in (1896) 1 NLR

362, the Full Bench of the Supreme Court presided over by Chief Justice

Bonser held:

The Court should not regard a partition suit as one to be decided

merely on issues raised by and between the parties, and it ought not

to make a decree, unless it is perfectly satisfied that the persons in

whose favour the decree is asked for are entitled to the property

sought to be partitioned.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court presided over by Chief Justice

Layard in the case of Mather v. Tamotharam Pillai 6 NLR 246, decided as

far back as in 1908, held:

A partition suit is not a mere proceeding inter partes to be settled of

consent, or by the opinion of the Court upon such points as they

choose to submit to it in the shape of issues. It is a matter in which

the Court must satisfy itself that the plaintiff has made out his title,

and unless he makes out his title his suit for partition must be

dismissed.

In partition proceedings the paramount duty is cast by the Ordinance

upon the District Judge himself to ascertain who are the actual

11

SC/APPEAL/89/2011

owners of the land. As collusion between the parties is always

possible, and as they get their title from the decree of the Court,

which is made good and conclusive as against the world, no

loopholes should be allowed for avoiding the performance of the duty

so cast upon the Judge.

In Juliana Hamine v. Don Thomas (1957) 59 NLR 546 at 549, L.W de Silva

A.J. observed:

A partition decree cannot be the subject of a private arrangement

between parties on matters of title which the Court is bound by law

to examine. While it is indeed essential for parties to a partition

action to state to the Court the points of contest inter se and to obtain

a determination on them, the obligations of the Court are not

discharged unless the provisions of section 25 of the Act are

complied with quite independently of what parties may or may

not do.

This has been consistently followed up to now. (Vide for instance:

Gooneratne v. Bishop of Colombo (1931) 32 NLR 337, Cooray v. Wijesuriya

(1958) 62 NLR 158, Gunathillake v. Muriel Silva (1974) 79(1) NLR 481,

Gnanapandithen v. Balanayagam [1998] 1 Sri LR 391, Piyaseeli v. Mendis

[2003] 3 Sri LR 273, Sumanawathie v. Andreas [2003] 3 Sri LR 324,

Somasiri v. Faleela [2005] 2 Sri LR 121, Basnayake v. Peter [2005] 3 Sri

LR 197, Karunaratne Banda v. Dassanayake [2006] 2 Sri LR 87, Silva v.

Dayaratne [2008] BLR 284, Abeysinghe v. Kumarasinghe [2008] BLR 300,

Sopinona v. Pitipanaarachchi [2010] 1 Sri LR 87.)

In Cynthia de Alwis v. Marjorie DAlwis [1997] 3 Sri LR 113, F.N.D.

Jayasuriya J. remarked:

A District Judge trying a partition action is under a sacred duty to

investigate into title on all material that is forthcoming at the

12

SC/APPEAL/89/2011

commencement of the trial. In the exercise of this sacred duty to

investigate title a trial Judge cannot be found fault with for being too

careful in his investigation. He has every right even to call for

evidence after the parties have closed their cases.

In the case of Godagampala v. Peter Fernando [2016] BLR 139 at 140,

Chithrasiri J. held:

It is trite law that the examination of such title of the parties in a

partition action is the duty of the trial judge though we follow the

adversarial system in this jurisdiction.

In Wijesundera v. Herath Appuhamy (1964) 67 CLW 63 at 64, T.S.

Fernando J. stated:

Presence or absence of Counsel makes no difference to the duty of

the learned trial judge to examine both oral and documentary

evidence in a partition case to satisfy himself on the question of title.

In the instant case, it is manifest that both the District Court and the

High Court failed to appreciate the special duty cast upon the District

Judge in a partition case. If the plaintiffs pedigree is ex facie incomplete

or unacceptable or doubtful, the District Judge shall not enter judgment

merely because the supposed contesting parties did not vigorously

challenge the evidence of the plaintiff. The general principle that

uncontroverted evidence is regarded as admitted (vide Edrick de Silva v.

Chandradasa de Silva (1967) 70 NLR 169 at 174) is inapplicable in

partition actions.

In my considered view, the plaintiff has not unfolded a proper pedigree

acceptable to Court in order for the Court to enter a partition decree.

Although in a partition case the plaintiff need not and in fact cannot start

the pedigree from the very first owner, as it is well-nigh impossible, the

13

SC/APPEAL/89/2011

plaintiff certainly cannot start the pedigree from his father as the original

owner.

I hold that there is no proper investigation of title. The judgment of the

District Court cannot be allowed to stand. I set aside the judgments of

the District Court and the High Court and allow the appeal but without

costs. The plaintiffs action shall stand dismissed.
