DECIDED ON: 31.10.2023

Judgement

Aluwihare, PC, J,

When the jurisdiction of this Court was invoked by the Petitioner, she was an officer

in Grade I of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (hereinafter SLAS). The Petitioner

sought leave to proceed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. It was

the contention of the Petitioner that her Fundamental Rights guaranteed under

Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution had been infringed by the

16

Respondents by their arbitrary and unlawful failure to call her for interview for

promotion from Grade I to the Special Grade of the SLAS. Having formed the opinion

that the application merits adjudication, this Court granted Leave to Proceed under

Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution on 20th June 2019. The 1st to 13th

Respondents were represented by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, the other

Respondents, however, were absent and unrepresented.

The Facts

The merits of the instant case directly correlate to the factual circumstances of

Petitioners Service in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. Therefore, the facts have

been set out below in their warranted detail.

(1) The Petitioner joined the Public Service as a Science Teacher on 10th December

1986. Thereafter, the Petitioner was appointed to the SLAS Class II Grade II with

effect from 10th September 1990 (letter marked P1A). The said appointment was

made under and in terms of the 1988 Minutes of the SLAS. The Petitioner held the

post of Assistant Divisional Secretary in Ambagamuwa Korale, Ginigathhena.

(2) Thereafter, in October 1992, in terms of the 1988 SLAS Service Minutes

(referred to above), the Petitioner duly completed the 1st Efficiency Bar Examination

(letter P4). In November 1992, the Petitioner married Mr. V. Krishnamoorthy, who

at the time was a career officer of the Sri Lanka Foreign Service. In 1992, upon the

Petitioners Husband being posted as the Third Secretary to the Sri Lankan Embassy

in Beijing, China, the Petitioner sought and obtained no pay leave from the SLAS

under and in terms of Chapter XII-Section 36 of the Establishments Code to join her

husband and relocate to Beijing, China. The said leave, to have effect from 1st

December 1992 to 1st December 1995 was approved by letter dated 24th November

1992 (marked P5A). The Petitioner therefore had actively served approximately 2

years and 3 months at the time of obtaining the said leave.

(3) While resident in China, the Petitioner gave birth to her two daughters, in

August 1993 and December 1994 respectively. The Petitioners Husbands period of

service was extended by the Foreign Service to 31st December 1997. The Petitioners

no pay leave too, was extended till 31st December 1997 (marked P5B-P5D). In the

17

meantime, the Petitioner duly completed the 2nd Efficiency Bar Examination as

stipulated in the 1988 SLAS Service Minutes. A copy of the results sheet dated 31st

January 1996 was produced (P6).

(4) In December 1997, the Petitioners family returned to Sri Lanka as her Husband

was attached to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Colombo. Thereafter, the Petitioner

resumed actively working in the SLAS, and worked as an Assistant Secretary to the

Judicial Service Commission and thereafter as Assistant Divisional Secretary,

Thimbirigasyaya from 1st January 1998 to 4th March 2001, for a period of 3 years

and 3 months.

(5) In 2001, the Petitioners Husband was appointed to the Embassy of Sri Lanka

in the Hague, the Netherlands. The Petitioner once again obtained no pay leave in

terms of Chapter XII Section 36 of the Establishments Code. The said no pay leave

was obtained from 1st March 2001 to 31st August 2004. The relevant approval and

extension letters were produced (marked P7A-P7D). Upon completion of that

assignment, the Petitioners Husband was reassigned to the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs in Colombo with effect from 1st September 2004. The Petitioner reported to

work with effect from 1st September 2004 as the Assistant Secretary/Director of the

Ministry of Social Services. The Petitioner served in this capacity for approximately

2 years.

(6) Thereafter, the Petitioners Husband was once again posted to Bangladesh to

serve as Sri Lankas High Commissioner with effect from 1st June 2006. The

Petitioner once again accompanied her Husband with her two daughters and

relocated to Bangladesh. The Petitioner left the country utilising her accumulated

leave under the Establishments Code. Upon arrival, the Petitioner was selected to

follow a postgraduate program at Dhaka University, leading to a Master of Social

Sciences in Public Administration. Upon completion of her Masters degree, as the

Petitioners Husband continued to serve as the Sri Lankan High Commissioner to

Bangladesh, the Petitioner obtained no pay leave once more in terms of Chapter XII

Section 36 of the Establishments Code from 4th April 2008 to 16th June 2009. The

letters of approval were produced (marked P8A and P8B).

18

(7) Upon conclusion of the Petitioners Husbands term in Bangladesh, the

Petitioner returned to Sri Lanka with her Eldest Daughter while the Husband and the

Younger Daughter relocated to Chennai, India for the Husbands new posting. The

Petitioner states that this was done because her children were then old enough to

live with one of their parents and the Petitioner wished to return to active service in

the SLAS. Upon her return, the Petitioner was appointed the Director, National

Secretariat for Elders, Ministry of Social Services.

(8) On 27th April 2010, the Petitioner was promoted to SLAS Grade II (letter

marked PIC) and on 01st July 2010, to SLAS Grade I (letter marked PID). These

appointments were made pursuant to the Sections of the 2005 Service Minute of the

SLAS. Thereafter, the Petitioner served as the Director, Presidential Task Force for

Trilingual Sri Lanka from 18th June 2012 to 23rd February 2013 and as Additional

Director General (Admin and Finance) of the Department of Technical Education

and Training from 27th February 2013 to 29th April 2016. From 2nd May 2016 to 1st

November 2016, the Petitioner served as the Food Commissioner and thereafter, till

31st December 2018, she served as the Director (Acting) to Department of Textile

Industries. On 1st January 2019, she was appointed as the Additional Secretary

(Acting) to the Ministry of Public Enterprises, Kandyan Heritage and Kandy

Development. At the time the present application was filed, on 23rd May 2019, the

Petitioner was serving as the Food Commissioner as well as Additional Secretary

(Acting) to the Ministry of Public Enterprises, Kandyan Heritage and Kandy

Development. Accordingly, from July 2009 to May 2019, the Petitioner was in active

service approximately 10 years in active service. In aggregate, the Petitioner has

served approximately 19 years in active service. This fact is not disputed by the

Respondents.

(9) Upon completion of 18 years in active service, the Petitioner had requested that

she be appointed to the Special Grade of the SLAS [letter dated 14th March 2018

addressed to the Secretary, Public Services Commission (marked P10)]. This request

received a response in the form of a letter dated 30th May 2018 from the Senior

Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs (with

the Secretary of the PSC being copied) stating that if the Petitioner so wishes to apply

for the promotion, she can do so once applications are called by the SLAS for the

19

promotion (marked P10B). In a further letter dated 07th June 2018 and addressed

to the Secretary, PSC through the Senior Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of

National Policies and Economic Affairs, the Petitioner detailed the status of her

eligibility for promotion to the Special Grade, in particular that she has completed

18 years of active service and as per the 2013 Service Minute of the SLAS, she is

eligible for promotion to the Special Grade. The Petitioner further mentions that as

per Section 36.4.1 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code, the period of no pay

leave taken by her should not have affected her seniority (marked P10C).

(10) On the 20th June 2018, the Senior Assistant Secretary of the PSC, on behalf of

the Secretary, wrote to the Petitioner, and wrote to the Secretary of the Ministry of

Public Administration, Law and Peace, stating that the Petitioner has indicated in her

prior appeals that she has achieved the necessary qualifications for the promotion to

the Special Grade as per the Extraordinary Gazette No. 1842/2 dated 23rd December

2013, and that she should be informed that she may apply for an interview for the

said promotion (marked P10D). Thereafter, the Additional Secretary of the Ministry

of National Policies and Economic Affairs, on behalf of the Secretary wrote to the

Petitioner, in a letter dated 03rd July 2018 (marked P10E) that she may apply for

interview for the said promotion, as per the direction of the aforementioned letter

from the PSC.

The Position of the Petitioner

The Petitioner filed the present application alleging that she was arbitrarily denied

of her right to be called for interviews for promotion to the vacancies of the Special

Grade of the SLAS on 1st July 2018, and that such denial was in violation of her

Fundamental Rights Guaranteed under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g). It must be

noted that after the filing of the application, promotions were made to the Special

Grade of SLAS on several occasions and the Petitioner too, was promoted to the

Special Grade with effect from 1st January 2020. The Petitioner thereafter amended

the relief sought to reflect her change in post and prayed for the date of her

promotion the Special Grade of SLAS to be ante-dated to the 1st July 2018. Thus, the

scope of the application was narrowed down to the issue of whether the failure to

back-date the promotion to 1st July 2018 amounts to a violation of her fundamental

rights, as alleged.

20

It is the Petitioners position that Section 36 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code

applies to the Petitioner in a manner such that her seniority would not have been

affected by the no-pay leave taken by her. The Petitioner also submitted that her

seniority should be assessed based on her total period of service, as period of active

service has a distinct existence. Consequently, it was argued that her eligibility for

promotion would have been assessed based on her total period of service, and she

would have been called for interview. Although the Petitioner submitted that there

is a difference between Seniority and Active service, the Petitioner did not

specify the root of such difference or how such difference would have any pragmatic

effect on promotions.

The Petitioner argued that under Section 36 of Chapter XII of the Establishments

Code she entertained a legitimate expectation that her seniority would be

safeguarded despite the no-pay leave taken. She further maintained that the 2013

SLAS Service Minute (marked 11R1 and 11R2), persons will be called for

interviews based on their seniority, and as such, the Petitioner should have been

called for interviews. To further buttress this argument, the Petitioner noted that as

per the Service Minute, the Interview Board was only required to satisfy themselves

of the applicants eligibility and seniority for affirmation of post. The Petitioner

argued that, by extension, if there was an issue regarding her seniority, such issue

should have been addressed by the Interview Board and not the Respondents who

prepared the list of persons being called for interview.

The Petitioner also relied on the contention that Section 36 of the Establishments

Code embodies the Right to Family and the recognition of the Family as the

fundamental unit in society as envisaged by Article 27(12) of the Constitution as a

Directive Principle of State Policy. Citing dicta in Kirahandi Yeshin Nanduja De Silva

and Another v. Principal of Dharmashoka Vidyalaya Ambalangoda and Others

[2017] SC FR 50/2015, and Ravindra Gunawardena Kariyawasam v. Cnetral

Environmental Authority & Others [2019] SC FR 141/2015, the Petitioner argued

that this Directive Principle must be interpreted and upheld in favour of the

Petitioners position that the law does not permit the seniority of officers who are

spouses of diplomats to be affected.

21

The Position of the 1st to 13th Respondents

It was the submission of the Respondents that the eligibility criteria and method of

promotion to the Special Grade of the SLAS were prescribed in Clause 13.3 of the

2013 SLAS Service Minute (marked 11R1), with the eligibility criteria being

specified in Clause 13.3(a) and the method of promotion being in Clause 13.3(b).

The Respondents adverted to the fact that the method of promotion (Clause 13.3(b))

was amended in 2018, and that at the time the promotion in question was being

sought, the method of promotion was governed by Clause 13.3(b) as amended. The

Clause is reproduced below prior to amendment, and as it appears after amendment

for ease of reference.

Prior to amendment:

After amendment (as it presently appears):

In response to the Petitioners contention that the 2013 SLAS Service Minute

contemplated two types of service, being the total period of service and period of

active service, the Respondents submitted that as per Clauses 13.3(a)(ii) and (iii),

the period of service required to be eligible for promotion is only computed in terms

22

of period of active service and no other criteria is used to measure period of service.

Consequently, the learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that the differentiation

sought to be established was misconceived and contrary to unambiguous language

in Clause 13.3(a).

In lieu of the above, it was also submitted on behalf of the Respondents that it is the

period of active service which must be considered to determine the seniority of

officers when effecting promotions under Clause 13.3(b) of the Service Minute.

It was the Petitioners contention that she had satisfied the minimum eligibility

criteria stipulated in Clause 13.3(a) and that she was entitled to be interviewed.

Responding to this contention, the Respondents argued that such position is

untenable and misconceived, as there is no right of being interviewed for the

following reasons:

- The SLAS is a cadre-based service;

- As per Clause 8.2 of the Service Minute, the Special Grade had 301 assigned

posts;

- At the time the impugned promotion was due, as per the Seniority List (marked

11R5), there were 799 officers in Grade I;

- Promotions to the Special Grade are contingent upon vacancies available (vide

Clause 13.3(b));

- Note No.1 to Clause 13.3(b) prescribes that only a number of officers in Grade

I who have completed the qualifications in 13.3(a) not exceeding the aggregate of

both the number of vacancies and a quantum of 25% of such vacancies will be

called for interview according to the seniority of such officers as at the date on

which the vacancies are taken into account.

Additionally, the Respondents furnished the Court with the following information

regarding the promotion:

Should the Petitioner have been called for Interview for promotion to the Special

Grade?

The crux of the Petitioners submission that her Fundamental Rights guaranteed

under Article 12(1) were violated rests on the contention that the Respondents had

23

arbitrarily and unlawfully failed to call the Petitioner for interviews. Therefore, the

central question which warrants determination is whether the Respondents had

acted as per the mandated procedures, specifically, as per the SLAS Service Minute

and the Establishments Code, as applicable.

The SLAS Service Minute

Section 13. 3(b) of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Minute, regarding the

promotion of officers to the Special Grade states that a total aggregate of the

vacancies available as at 01st January or 1st July, as well as 25% of persons fulfilling

that aggregate shall be called for interviews based on seniority. Accordingly,

although 128 applications were received, only 71 officers were called for interviews.

The Establishments Code

The Petitioner relies on Section 36:1:4 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code to

contend that she, as the Spouse of an Officer posted abroad, bore a Legitimate

Expectation that her seniority would not be affected by virtue of any no-pay leave

approved under the Section. Section 36:1:4 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code

reads as follows:

Subject to the following provisions, the seniority of such an officer [an officer who

is the Spouse of an Officer posted abroad] will not be affected as a result of obtaining

this no pay leave.

i. An officer who is granted no-pay leave under this section should not be

considered for any promotion to any vacancies which may arise during the

period of his no pay leave.

ii. Where a scheme of recruitment specifies a minimum period of service as a

qualification for promotion, the period of no-pay leave granted under this

section should not be reckoned for computing the minimum period of

service. [parenthesis and emphasis added]

It is correct to state therefore that Section 36:1:4 of Chapter XII of the Establishments

Code provides that where a promotion to a specific grade is dependent on the

completion of a minimum period of service, the period of no-pay leave taken by such

officer should not be counted for the purposes of ascertaining the minimum period

24

of service completed by such officer.

Process of Promotion

The Respondents provided the following details of the process of promotion to the

Special Grade in July 2018.

1. By Notice dated 13th March 2018 (marked P11 and P11A), the Secretary,

Ministry of

Public Administration and Disaster Management called for applications to the

Special Grade of the SLAS.

2. As at 01st January there were 19 vacancies in the SLAS Special Grade and as at

01st July 2018 there were 38 vacancies, amounting to a total of 57 vacancies as

at 01st July.

3. Applications were received from 128 Grade I officers of the SLAS, including that

of the Petitioner (marked P12 and P12A).

4. Since the number of applications received exceeded the number of available

vacancies, candidates were shortlisted for promotion interviews as specified in

Note 1 to Clause 13.3(b) of the SLAS Service Minute, based on the seniority of the

officers who had tendered applications.

5. Seniority of the officers was determined by the official Seniority List maintained

by the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration (marked 11R5 and referred

to above).

6. Accordingly, 71 officers were shortlisted for interviews and a notice listing the

names of such officers was published on the 24th of April 2019 (letter marked

P13A). The list of names was revised by changing 4 names. The revised list

(marked as P13C) contains 67 names as 4 officers were listed for both

interviews in respect of vacancies available as at 01st January 2018 and 01st July

2018.

7. For the aforementioned reason, the list of names was once again revised by

substituting the names of the 81st, 82nd, 83rd and 84th Respondents in place of the

4 officers who were double counted, the 77th to 80th Respondents. The

Respondents submitted that the 81st and 82nd Respondents were included as the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal had quashed the disciplinary orders made

against them while the 83rd and 84th Respondents had been included subsequent

25

to concessions being granted to them in respect of their Efficiency Bar

Examinations from the Public Service Commission for the antedating of their

appointment to SLAS Grade I.

8. Subsequently, interviews were conducted, and approval was granted by the

Public Service Commission to promote 19 officers with effect from 1st January

2018 and 37 officers with effect from 01st July 2018.

9. The Respondents also submit that all the officers who were called for interviews

and subsequently promoted were senior in service to the Petitioner for the reason

that although most of them had joined the SLAS after the Petitioner, they had

surpassed her in seniority at the time of her promotion to Grade II, due to their

accumulation of service whilst the Petitioner had obtained an extensive period of

no-pay leave. Accordingly, all such officers had secured their promotion to the

Grade II by the 15th February 2010 while the petitioner had secured her

promotion to Grade II by the 27th April 2010. The same officers had maintained

such seniority above the Petitioner in Grade I.

10. The Petitioner was not considered for interviews even though she had tendered

an application as she was ranked 208th in the Seniority List, which is considerably

lower than the seniority ranks of the officers who had been called for interview.

The Seniority List

The Seniority List (marked 11R5) lists the Petitioner at No. 208 and therefore places

her far beyond the number of SLAS officers within contention of being called for

interview for the promotion. The Petitioner disputes the veracity of the Seniority List

produced by the Respondents (vide para 25 of the written submission dated

12.08.2021). The Petitioner claims that although it is conceded that 11th Respondent

is responsible for maintaining the list, the author of the list is not revealed and

therefore its originality or authenticity is unacceptable. The Respondents maintain

that this list was maintained in documentary form since 1978 and since 2001, it was

maintained in electronic form in the official website of the Ministry of Public

Administration, which was publicly accessible and had been updated at least once

every three months on the website, and functions as the central roll or register of

SLAS officers.

Provided that this Seniority List is key in determining whether the Petitioner was

26

within the list of officers and applicants (an interviewee must be both) who could be

called for interview, I find it prudent to reiterate the position in our Jurisprudence

on who bears the Burden of Proof. Our Courts have strenuously followed the core

maxim of affirmanti non neganti incumbit probatio in holding that the burden of

proof lies upon him who asserts and not who denies. This is trite law. Applying the

principle to the present case, it becomes evident that the burden of proving that the

Seniority List cannot be accepted as an official record of the seniority of officers in

the SLAS rests firmly with the Petitioner.

It is the Petitioners contention that her legitimate expectations and Fundamental

Right to Equality before the Law guaranteed under Article 12(1) have been violated.

It logically follows that it is the Petitioner who asserts that she was within the list of

officers who were eligible for promotion to the Special Grade by 1st July 2018 and

consequently, should have been called for interview. In effect, it is the Petitioner who

must prove that she was in such a position. In order to do so, the Petitioner cannot

merely dispute the veracity of the list produced to dispute the Petitioners position by

the Respondents, she must establish before court, on her own accord, independent

to the material produced by the Respondents, that she was placed in the Seniority ist

of the SLAS in a manner making her not eligible for promotion, but also that the

Respondents were bound to call her for interview above and before other applicants.

The position of the Petitioner falls further beyond the ambit of merit when

considering that, as the Petitioner was a senior officer in the SLAS who had received

promotions to Grade II and Grade I which were also conditioned on Seniority and

therefore based on the same list, had there been any issue with regard to her

positioning on the list, she could have raised the matter at any time prior the calling

of applications for vacancies for the Special Grade.

Secondly, it is also worth noting that provisions of the Evidence Ordinance provide

for producing duly certified copies of Public Documents as proof of the contents

therein and the Court can presume that the Seniority List of the SLAS was produced

as genuine. Once the contents therein were proven by operation of the law, the

burden of showing its contents are not accurate fell on the Petitioner. Besides noting

that no one officer has claimed responsibility for creating the list, the Petitioner has

not produced any material which could establish why she should not have been

27

placed 208th in such list by referring to her service record. The Court, therefore, can

rely on the Seniority List that was produced by the Respondents as a genuine and

accurate document, in the absence of any proof to the contrary.

Accordingly, the following facts must be observed in determining the Respondents

compliance with the Establishments Code and the SLAS Service Minute:

The No. of Vacancies for the SLAS Special Grade as at 01st July 2018 = 57

The No. of Persons who were shortlisted for Interview [57 + (25% of 57)] = 71

The Seniority Rank of Petitioner according to the List = 208

Clause 13.3(a)(iii) of the SLAS Service Minute lists an active period of service not

less than eighteen years as at the date of promotion to be eligible for promotion to

the SLAS Special Grade. Although the Petitioner sought to submit the view that the

service minute contemplates the total period of service and seniority, for the

purpose of calling officers for interview, must be determined by such total period,

and not active period, it must be observed that Clause 13.3 does not require an

examination of the entire period of service. Therefore, it must be understood that

any minimum period of service contemplated under the Clause refers to active

service alone.

By extension, the aforementioned conclusion also leads to the view that Section 36

of the Establishments Code did affect the seniority of the Petitioner. Importantly,

Section 36 begins by stating that Subject to the following provisions, the seniority

of such an officer [an officer who is the Spouse of an Officer posted abroad] will not

be affected as a result of obtaining this no pay leave and the 2nd Proviso reads as

follows:

Where a scheme of recruitment specifies a minimum period of service as a

qualification for promotion, the period of no-pay leave granted under this section

should not be reckoned for computing the minimum period of service.

Accordingly, it can be understood that the minimum period of service contemplated

in Clause 13.3 of the Service Minute for the promotion of officers to the Special

Grade is stated in Clause 13.3(a)(iii) wherein an active period of service not less

28

than eighteen years as at the date of promotion is required. I therefore subscribe to

the view advanced on behalf of the Respondents, that the Petitioners seniority was

duly affected by operation of the law and that she was not arbitrarily or unlawfully

denied an opportunity to interview for promotion to the Special Grade.

In the absence of any arbitrary or unlawful action by the Respondents, I hold that

the Petitioner has failed to establish a violation of Fundamental Rights guaranteed in

terms of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, and the Petitioner is not entitled to the

relief prayed. Accordingly, the application is dismissed.

However, taking into account the circumstances of this case, I order no costs.

Application dismissed.
