"I
t is the Petitioner’s position that Section 36 of Chapter XII of the Establishments Code"
"applies to the Petitioner in a manner such that her seniority would not have been"
"affected  by  the  no-pay  leave  taken  by  her.  The  Petitioner  also  submitted  that  her"
"‘seniority’ should be assessed based on her total period of service, as ‘period of active"
"service’ has a distinct existence. Consequently, it was argued that her eligibility for"
"promotion would have been assessed based on her total period of service, and she"
"would have been called for interview. Although the Petitioner submitted that there"
"is  a  difference  between  “Seniority”  and  “Active  service”,  the  Petitioner  did  not"
"specify the root of such difference or how such difference would have any pragmatic"
"effect on promotions."
