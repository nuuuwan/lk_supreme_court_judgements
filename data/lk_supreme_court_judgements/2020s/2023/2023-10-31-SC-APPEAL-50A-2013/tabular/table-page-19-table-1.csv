"","of  the  building.  Therefore,  it  was  submitted  that  the  Appellant’s  refusal  to"
"","reimburse  these  expenses  is  unfairly  detrimental  and  prejudicial  to  other"

9)","By failing to respond to the letter issued to the Appellant Bank which requested"
"","it to elect which powers it wished to exercise under S. 358(1) of the Companies"
"","Act,  the  Appellant  Bank  surrendered  its  authority  to  claim  treatment  as  a"
"","secured creditor and the consequences of its own inaction must not be borne"
"","by  another.  Effectively,  the  whole  liquidation  process  is  hampered  by  the"
"","Appellant’s inaction and refusal to return to the liquidation the proceeds paid"
"","to  it  for  the  discharge  of  the  mortgage  and  its  refusal  to  reimburse  the"
"","liquidator’s expenses."
"30)","Furthermore,  it  must  be  noted  that  the  learned  High  Court  Judge,  in  his"
"","wisdom,  comprehensively  analysed  the  procedural  impropriety  which  had"
"","ensued at the hands of the Appellant Bank and noted the distinction between"
"","sum amounts paid for the setting off and discharge of a mortgage and that of"
"","sums  paid  as  result  of  pursuing 
the  procedural  scheme  set  out  for 
the"

"","Appellant Bank claims to have acted as a Secured Creditor, it should have done"
"","so  after  making  a  valuation  and  claim  in  the  manner  prescribed  in  Section"
"","358(4)  and  the  Liquidator  should  have,  upon  receipt  of  the  claim  in  the"
"","prescribed  form,  either  accepted,  revised  or  rejected  the  valuation  as  per"
"","Section 358(6) and 358(7). As correctly observed by the learned High Court"
"","Judge, the fact that the Appellant Bank had not pursued this procedural scheme"
"","would  therefore  indicate  that  the  Appellant  Bank  was  not,  in  fact,  and  by"
"","operation of the law, a Secured Creditor and that the proceeds of the realisation"
"","paid  to  the  Appellant  Bank  to  set  off  and  discharge  the  mortgage  should  be"
"","returned to the liquidation process."
"31)","The order of the learned High Court Judge dated 7th June 2013 states that the"
"","expenses  incurred  by  the  Liquidator  (including  the  amount  paid  for  the"
"","discharge  of  the  mortgage)  must  be  recovered  from  the  sale  proceeds  of"
