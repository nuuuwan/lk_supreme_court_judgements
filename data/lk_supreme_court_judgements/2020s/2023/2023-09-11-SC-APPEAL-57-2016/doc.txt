Introduction

The plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Kuliyapitiya seeking

a declaration of title to, ejectment of the defendant from, the two

allotments of land described in the schedule to the plaint, and damages.

The plaintiff relied on deed No. 3016 to claim title to the said allotments.

The 1st defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs action

on the basis that the 1st defendant came into possession of the land upon

making some advance payments to the vendors of deed No. 3016 well

before the execution of this deed. After trial, the District Court dismissed

the plaintiffs action accepting the defendants version. On appeal, the

High Court of Civil Appeal of Kurunegala set aside the judgment of the

District Court and entered judgment for the plaintiff. Hence this appeal

by the 1st defendant. This Court granted leave to appeal mainly on three

questions of law:

6 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

(a) Did the High Court err in law in not considering that in a rei

vindicatio action the burden is on the plaintiff to establish title

pleaded and relied on by him and the defendant need not prove

anything?

(b) Did the High Court err in law in not considering that the title deed

of the plaintiff only conveys undivided 7/8 shares of the property

and therefore the plaintiff failed to establish title as held in Hariette

v. Pathmasiri [1996] 1 Sri LR 358?

(c) Did the High Court err in law in not considering that the plaintiff

was a speculative buyer who knew the land was possessed by the

defendant, possession having been given to the defendant by the

same vendors?

Burden and standard of proof in a rei vindicatio action

At the commencement of the trial before the District Court admissions

were recorded. The third and fourth admissions are that at one point of

time the 2nd defendant was the owner of the land in suit and she (the 2nd

defendant) executed the aforementioned deed of transfer No. 3016 in

favour of the plaintiff. The 1st defendant has no paper title to the land.

Learned counsel for the 1st defendant in his post-argument written

submission admits this when he says The defendant had an actual

exclusive possession of the land with the intention of becoming the owner.

In the plaint the plaintiff has taken up the position that the 1st defendant

came into possession of the land on the leave and licence of the plaintiffs

vendors. This has not been accepted by the District Judge. Despite the

above admissions, the District Judge has held that by deed No. 3016

what has been transferred is only 7/8 shares but not the full title as

claimed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff does not challenge this finding of

the District Judge. Based on these findings, learned counsel for the 1st

defendant argues that this being a rei vindicatio action, the plaintiff has

7 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

failed to prove title to the land as pleaded in the plaint and therefore the

plaintiffs action must fail. I will deal with this in greater detail since the

burden of proof and the standard of proof in rei vindicatio actions are

overwhelmingly shrouded in misconceptions, misconstructions and

misunderstandings.

In order to succeed in a rei vindicatio action, first and foremost, the

plaintiff shall prove his ownership to the property. If he fails to prove it,

his action shall fail. This principle is based on the Latin maxim onus

probandi incumbit ei qui agit, which means, the burden of proof lies with

the person who brings the action. Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance

is also to a similar effect.

Macdonell C.J. in De Silva v. Goonetilleke (1960) 32 NLR 217 at

219 stated:

There is abundant authority that a party claiming a declaration of

title must have title himself. To bring the action rei vindicatio

plaintiff must have ownership actually vested in him. (1 Nathan p.

362, s. 593.)....The authorities unite in holding that plaintiff must

show title to the corpus in dispute and that if he cannot, the action

will not lie.

In Pathirana v. Jayasundera (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 172, Gratiaen J.

declared:

The plaintiffs ownership of the thing is of the very essence of the

action. Maasdorps Institutes (7th Ed.) Vol. 2, 96.

In Mansil v. Devaya [1985] 2 Sri LR 46, G.P.S. De Silva J. (as he then

was) stated at 51:

In a rei vindicatio action, on the other hand, ownership is of the

essence of the action; the action is founded on ownership.

8 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

In Latheef v. Mansoor [2010] 2 Sri LR 333 at 352, Marsoof J. held:

An important feature of the actio rei vindicatio is that it has to

necessarily fail if the plaintiff cannot clearly establish his title.

Having said the above, it needs to be emphasised that the plaintiff in a

rei vindicatio action has no heavier burden to discharge than a plaintiff

in any other civil action. The standard of proof in a rei vindicatio action is

on a balance of probabilities.

Professor George Wille, in his monumental work Willes Principles of

South African Law, 9th Edition (2007), states at page 539:

To succeed with the rei vindicatio, the owner must prove on a

balance of probabilities, first, his or her ownership in the property.

If a movable is sought to be recovered, the owner must rebut the

presumption that the possessor of the movable is the owner thereof.

In the case of immovables, it is sufficient as a rule to show that title

in the land is registered in his or her name. Secondly, the property

must exist, be clearly identifiable and must not have been destroyed

or consumed. Money, in the form of coins and banknotes, is not

easily identifiable and thus not easily vindicable. Thirdly, the

defendant must be in possession or detention of the thing at the

moment the action is instituted. The rationale is to ensure that the

defendant is in a position to comply with an order for restoration.

In Preethi Anura v. William Silva (SC/APPEAL/116/2014, SC Minutes of

05.06.2017), the plaintiff filed a rei vindicatio action against the

defendant seeking a declaration of title to the land in suit and the

ejectment of the defendant therefrom. The District Court held with the

plaintiff but the High Court of Civil Appeal set aside the judgment of the

District Court on the basis that the plaintiff failed to prove title to the

land. The plaintiffs title commenced with a statutory determination made

9 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

under section 19 of the Land Reform Law in favour of his grandmother,

who had bequeathed the land by way of a last will to the plaintiff, with

the land being later conveyed to the plaintiff by way of an executors

conveyance. No documentary evidence was tendered to establish that the

last will was proved in Court and admitted to probate in order to validate

the said executors conveyance. The District Court was satisfied that the

said factors were proved by oral evidence but the High Court found the

same insufficient to discharge the burden that rests upon a plaintiff in a

rei vindicatio action, which the High Court considered to be very heavy.

The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the High Court and restored

the judgment of the District Court, taking the view that the plaintiff had

proved title to the land despite the purported shortcomings. In the course

of the judgment, Dep C.J. (with De Abrew J. and Jayawardena J.

agreeing) remarked:

In a rei vindicatio action, the plaintiff has to establish the title to the

land. Plaintiff need not establish the title with mathematical

precision nor to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt as in a

criminal case. The plaintiffs task is to establish the case on a

balance of probability. In a partition case the situation is different as

it is an action in rem and the trial judge is required to carefully

examine the title and the devolution of title. This case being a rei

vindicatio action this court has to consider whether the plaintiff

discharged the burden on balance of probability.

What is the degree of proof expected when the standard of proof is on a

balance of probabilities? This is better understood when proof on a

balance of probabilities is compared with proof beyond a reasonable

doubt.

On proof beyond a reasonable doubt, in Miller v. Minister of Pensions

[1947] 2 All ER 372, Lord Denning declared at 373:

10 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond the

shadow of doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote

possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence

of course it is possible, but not in the least probable, the case is

proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will

suffice.

In relation to proof on a balance of probabilities, it was stated at 374:

That degree is well settled. It must carry a reasonable degree of

probability, but not so high as is required in a criminal case. If the

evidence is such that the tribunal can say: We think it more

probable than not, the burden is discharged, but, if the probabilities

are equal, it is not.

In consideration of the degree of proof in a rei vindicatio action, we

invariably refer to the seminal judgment of Pathirana v. Jayasundara

(1955) 58 NLR 169. In that case the plaintiff sued the defendant on the

basis that the defendant was an overholding lessee. The defendant

admitted the bare execution of the lease but stated that the lessors were

unable to give him possession of the land. He averred that the land was

sold to him by its lawful owner (not one of the lessors) and that by adverse

possession from that date he had acquired title by prescription. The

plaintiff then sought to amend the plaint by claiming a declaration of title

and ejectment on the footing that his rights of ownership had been

violated. The Supreme Court held:

A lessor of property who institutes action on the basis of a cause of

action arising from a breach by the defendant of his contractual

obligation as lessee is not entitled to amend his plaint subsequently

11 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

so as to alter the nature of the proceeding to an action rei vindicatio

if such a course would prevent or prejudice the setting up by the

defendant of a plea of prescriptive title.

In the course of the judgment the Court distinguished an action for

declaration of title (based on the contractual relationship between the

plaintiff and the defendant) from an action rei vindicatio proper. In

general terms, in both actions, a declaration of title is sought in the

former, as a matter of course, without strict proof of title, but in the latter,

as a peremptory requirement, with strict proof of title. H.N.G. Fernando

J. (as he then was) at page 171 explained the distinction between the two

in this way:

There is however the further point that the plaintiff in his prayer

sought not only ejectment but also a declaration of title, a prayer for

which latter relief is probably unusual in an action against an

overholding tenant. I have no doubt that it is open to a lessor in an

action for ejectment to ask for a declaration of title, but the question

of difficulty arises is whether the action thereby becomes a rei

vindicatio for which strict proof of the plaintiff's title would be

required, or else is merely one for a declaration (without strict proof)

of a title which the tenant by law precluded from denying. If the

essential element of a rei vindicatio is that the right of ownership

must be strictly proved, it is difficult to accept the proposition that an

action in which the plaintiff can automatically obtain a declaration

of title through the operation of a rule in estoppel should be regarded

as a vindicatory action. The fact that the person in possession of

property originally held as lessee would not preclude the lessor-

owner from choosing to proceed against him by a rei vindicatio. But

this choice can I think be properly exercised only by clearly setting

out the claim of title and sounding in delict.

12 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

The term strict proof of the plaintiffs title used here does not mean that

the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action shall prove title beyond a reasonable

doubt or a very high degree of proof. The term strict proof of the plaintiffs

title was used to distinguish the standard of proof between a declaration

of title action based on a contractual relationship between the plaintiff

and the defendant such as lessor and lessee, and a rei vindicatio action

proper based on ownership of the property. In a rei vindicatio action, if

the plaintiff proves on a balance of probabilities that he is the owner, he

must succeed.

The distinction between an action for declaration of title and ejectment

and a rei vindicatio action was also emphasised by Wigneswaran J. in

Luwis Singho and Others v. Ponnamperuma [1996] 2 Sri LR 320 at 324:

Though due to procedural steps introduced by the Civil Procedure

Code there may appear no real difference today in Sri Lanka

between an action rei vindicatio and an action for declaration of title

and ejectment it may not be correct to equate them as co-extensive

in scope and content.

Professor G.L. Peiris, in his treatise Law of Property in Sri Lanka, Vol I,

makes it clear at page 304:

It must be emphasized, however, that the observations in these

cases to the effect that the plaintiffs title must be strictly proved in

a rei vindicatio, cannot be accepted as containing the implication that

a standard of exceptional stringency applies in this context. An

extremely exacting standard is insisted upon in certain categories of

action such as partition actions.It is clear that a standard

characterized by this degree of severity does not apply to the proof

of a plaintiffs title in a rei vindicatory action.

13 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

(Justice) Dr. H.W. Tambiah opines in Survey of Laws Controlling

Ownership of Lands in Sri Lanka, Vol 2, International Property

Investment Journal 217 at pages 243-244:

In a vindicatory action, the plaintiff must prove that he is the owner

of the property which is in the possession of the defendant. See de

Silva v. Gunathilleke, 32 N.L.R. 217 (1931); Abeykoon Hamine v.

Appuhamy, 52 N.L.R. 49 (1951); Muthusamy v. Seneviratne, 31

C.L.W. 91 (1946). Once title is established, the burden shifts to the

defendant to prove that by adverse possession for a period of 10

years he has acquired prescriptive title. Siyaneris v. Udenis de Silva,

52 N.L.R. 289 (1951). In rei vindicatory action once the plaintiff

proves he was in possession but then he was evicted by the

defendant, the burden of proving title will shift to the defendant. In

Kathiramathamby v. Arumugam 38 C.L.W. 27 (1948) it was held

that if the plaintiff alleges that he was forcibly ousted by the

defendant the burden of proving ouster remains with the

complainant. As a practical matter, the burden of proof in a rei

vindicatio action is not burdensome. The plaintiff must prove only

that he is the probable owner of the property.

The view of Dr. Tambiah As a practical matter, the burden of proof in a

rei vindicatio action is not burdensome. The plaintiff must prove only that

he is the probable owner of the property shall be understood in the

context of his view expressed at the outset that In a vindicatory action,

the plaintiff must prove that he is the owner of the property which is in the

possession of the defendant.

The recent South African case of Huawei Technologies South Africa (Pty)

Limited v. Redefine Properties Limited and Another [2018] ZAGPJHC 403

decided on 29.05.2018 reveals that the burden of proof cast on a plaintiff

in a rei vindicatio action is not unduly onerous. In this case it was held

14 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

that what the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action needs to prove is that he

is the owner of the property (which the Court stated could be done by

producing his title deed) and that the defendant is holding or in

possession of the property. Once this is done, the onus shifts to the

defendant to establish a right to continue to hold against the owner. Cele

J. declared:

The rei vindicatio is the common law real action for the protection of

ownership. C.P. Smith, Eviction and Rental Claims: A Practical Guide

at p. 1-2; Graham v. Ridley 1931 TPD 476; Chetty v. Naidoo 1974

(3) SA 13 (A). It is inherent in the nature of ownership that possession

of the res should normally be with the owner and it follows that no

other person may withhold it from the owner unless he or she is

vested with some right enforceable against the owner. The owner, in

instituting a rei vindicatio, need do no more than allege and prove

that he is the owner and that the defendant is holding or in

possession of the res. The onus is on the Defendant to allege and

establish a right to continue to hold against the owner. Chetty v.

Naidoo (supra) at 20 AE. A court does not have an equitable

discretion to refuse an order for ejectment on the grounds of equity

and fairness. Belmont House v. Gore NNO 2011 (6) SA 173 (WCC) at

para [15]. In the case of eviction based on an owners rei vindicatio,

the owner has only to prove his ownership which can be done by

producing his title deed indicating that the property is registered in

his name. Goudini Chrome (Pty) Ltd v. MCC Contracts (Pty) Ltd [1999]

ZASCA 208; 1993 (1) SA 77 (A) at 82 AC.

In De Vos v. Adams and Others [2016] ZAWCHC 202 decided on

06.12.2016, Davis J. stated:

Turning specifically to the rei vindicatio it is clear that there are three

requirements which the owner must prove on a balance of

15 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

probabilities, in order to succeed with the particular action. Firstly,

the applicant must show his or her ownership in the property. In the

case of immovable property it is sufficient as a result to show the

title in the land is registered in his or her name. Secondly, the

property must exist, be clearly identifiable and must not have been

destroyed or consumed. Thirdly, the defendant must be in

possession or detention of the property at the time that the action is

instituted.

The requirement of proof of chain of title which is the norm in a partition

action is not applicable in a rei vindicatio action. If there is no challenge

to the title deed of the plaintiff on specific grounds, the plaintiff can prove

his ownership to the property by producing his title deed. This view was

expressed by Professor Wille (op. cit. at page 539) when he stated that In

the case of immovables, it is sufficient as a rule to show that title in the

land is registered in his or her name.

When the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, the Court is

entitled to consider whose version the plaintiffs or the defendants is

more probable.

Banda v. Soyza [1998] 1 Sri LR 255 was a rei vindicatio action filed by a

trustee of a temple seeking a declaration of title, the ejectment of the

defendant and damages. The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of

the District Court and the plaintiffs action was dismissed on the ground

that the plaintiff had failed to establish title to the subject matter of the

action or even to identify the land in suit. But the Supreme Court set

aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restored the judgment of

the District Court on the basis that there was sufficient evidence led on

behalf of the plaintiff to prove the title and the identity of the lots in

dispute. G.P.S. de Silva C.J. laid down at page 259 the criterion to be

16 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

adopted in a rei vindicatio action in respect of the onus of proof in the

following manner:

In a case such as this, the true question that a court has to consider

on the question of title is, who has the superior title? The answer

has to be reached upon a consideration of the totality of the evidence

led in the case.

Dr. H.W. Tambiah (op. cit. at p. 244) refers to proof of superior title by

the defendant as a defence to a rei vindicatio action.

In a vindicatory action, the defendant has numerous defenses,

which include: denial of the plaintiffs title; establishment of his own

title, in the sense of establishing a title superior to that of the plaintiff;

prescription; a plea of res judicata; right of tenure under the plaintiff

for example usufruct, pledge or lease of land; the right to retain

possession subject to an indemnity from the plaintiff under peculiar

conditions; a plea of exception rei venditae et traditae; and, ius tertii.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Jinawathie v. Emalin Perera

[1986] 2 Sri LR 121 adverted to superior title and sufficient title and

held that the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action shall prove that he has title

to the disputed property and that such title is superior to the title, if any,

put forward by the defendant, or that he has sufficient title which he can

vindicate against the defendant.

The plaintiff in Jinawathies case filed a rei vindicatio action against the

defendants relying upon a statutory determination made under section

19 of the Land Reform Law, No. 1 of 1972. The defendants sought the

dismissal of the plaintiffs action on the basis that the alleged statutory

determination did not convey any title on the plaintiff and that in the

absence of the plaintiff demonstrating dominium over the land, the

plaintiffs action shall fail. Both the District Court and the Court of

17 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

Appeal held with the plaintiff and the Supreme Court affirmed it.

Ranasinghe J. (as he then was) with the agreement of Sharvananda C.J.,

Wanasundera J., Atukorale J., and Tambiah J., whilst emphasising that

in a rei vindicatio action proper, the plaintiffs ownership of the land is of

the very essence of the action, expressed the view of the Supreme Court

in the following terms at page 142:

This principle was re-affirmed once again by Gratiaen J. in the case

of Palisena v. Perera (1954) 56 NLR 407 where the plaintiff came into

court to vindicate his title based upon a permit issued under the

provisions of the Land Development Ordinance (Chap. 320). In giving

judgment for the plaintiff, Gratiaen, J. said: a permit-holder who

has complied with the conditions of his permit enjoys, during the

period for which the permit is valid, a sufficient title which he can

vindicate against a trespasser in civil proceedings. The fact that the

alleged trespasser had prevented him from entering upon the land

does not afford a defence to the action.

In a vindicatory action the plaintiff must himself have title to the

property in dispute: the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that he has

title to the disputed property, and that such title is superior to the

title, if any, put forward by the defendant in occupation. The plaintiff

can and must succeed only on the strength of his own title, and not

upon the weakness of the defence.

On a consideration of the foregoing principles relating to the legal

concept of ownership, and to an action rei vindicatio it seems to me

that the plaintiff-respondent did, at the time of the institution of these

proceedings, have, by virtue of P6 [statutory determination],

sufficient title which she could have vindicated against the

defendants-appellants in proceedings such as these.

18 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

In the Supreme Court case of Khan v. Jayman [1994] 2 Sri LR 233 the

plaintiff sued the defendant for ejectment from the premises in suit and

damages on the basis that the defendant was in forcible occupation of

the premises after the termination of the leave and licence given to the

defendant. The defendant claimed tenancy. The District Court dismissed

the plaintiffs action on the basis that the plaintiff failed to establish that

the defendant was a licensee and the Court of Appeal affirmed it. On

appeal, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff shall succeed since the

defendant failed to establish a better title to the property after the

plaintiff established his title and the defendant in his evidence admitted

the plaintiffs title. Kulatunga J. with the agreement of G.P.S. De Silva

C.J. and Wadugodapitiya J. stated at page 235:

The plaintiff did not pray for a declaration of title or raise an issue

on ownership, presumably because no challenge to his ownership

was anticipated. Indeed the defendants answer did not deny the

plaintiffs title. At the trial, the plaintiff established his title and the

defendant in his evidence admitted the plaintiff's title to the premises

in suit. This action is, therefore, a vindicatory action i.e. an action

founded on ownership. Maasdorps Institutes of South African Law

Vol. II Eighth Edition page 70 commenting on the right of an owner

to recover possession of his property states

The plaintiff's ownership in the thing is the very essence of such an

action and will have to be both alleged and proved

He also states

The ownership of a thing consists in the exclusive rights of

possession and in the absence of any agreement or other legal

restriction to the contrary, it entitles the owner to claim possession

19 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

from anyone who cannot set up a better title to it and warn him off

the property, and eject him from it.

The argument of the defendant that he was prejudiced in his defence as

the plaintiff did not sue the defendant as the owner of the premises was

rejected by the Supreme Court. Kulatunga J. stated at 239:

Learned Counsel for the defendant-respondent also submitted that

in view of the fact that this was not a case of the plaintiff suing as

owner simpliciter and in the absence of an issue on ownership, the

defendant would not have known the case he had to meet and was

prejudiced in his defence. I cannot agree. As stated early in this

judgment, the plaintiff pleaded his ownership and clearly set out his

case, including the fact that the defendant was in occupation of a

room of the premises in suit by leave and licence. The defendant too

set out his case in unambiguous terms viz. that he was a protected

tenant from 1971. In the end, the plaintiff proved his case whilst the

defendant failed to establish a better title to the property. As such,

the question of prejudice does not arise.

When the paper title to the property is admitted or proved to be in the

plaintiff, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove on what right he is

in possession of the property.

In Siyaneris v. Udenis de Silva (1951) 52 NLR 289 the Privy Council held:

In an action for declaration of title to property, where the legal title

is in the plaintiff but the property is in the possession of the

defendant, the burden of proof is on the defendant.

In Theivandran v. Ramanathan Chettiar [1986] 2 Sri LR 219 at 222,

Sharvananda C.J. stated:

20 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

In a vindicatory action the claimant need merely prove two facts;

namely, that he is the owner of the thing and that the thing to which

he is entitled to possession by virtue of his ownership is in the

possession of the defendant. Basing his claim on his ownership,

which entitles him to possession, he may sue for the ejectment of

any person in possession of it without his consent. Hence when the

legal title to the premises is admitted or proved to be in the plaintiff,

the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that he is in lawful

possession.

This was quoted with approval by G.P.S. de Silva C.J. in Beebi Johara v.

Warusavithana [1998] 3 Sri LR 227 at 229 and reiterated in Candappa

nee Bastian v. Ponnambalam Pillai [1993] 1 Sri LR 184 at 187. Vide also

Wijetunge v. Thangarajah [1999] 1 Sri LR 53, Gunasekera v. Latiff [1999]

1 Sri LR 365 at 370, Jayasekera v. Bishop of Kandy [2002] 2 Sri LR 406

and Loku Menika v. Gunasekara [1997] 2 Sri LR 281 at 282-283.

The right to possession is an essential attribute of ownership. The owner

of the land has the right to exclude others from its use.

Maasdorps Institutes of South African Law, Vol II, 8th Edition (1960), p.

27) states the rights of an owner are comprised under three heads,

namely, (1) the right of possession and the right to recover possession; (2)

the right of use and enjoyment; and (3) the right of disposition. He goes on

to say that these three factors are all essential to the idea of ownership

but need not all be present in an equal degree at one and the same time.

As stated in K.J. Aiyars Judicial Dictionary, 11th Edition (1995), page

833, it is not possible to give a comprehensive definition to the rights of

ownership. Traditionally, those rights include:

Jus utendi the right to use of the thing

Jus possidendi the right to possess a thing

21 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

Jus abutendi the right to consume or destroy a thing

Jus despondendi vei transferendi the right to dispose of a thing

or to transfer it as by sale, gift, exchange etc.

Jus sibi habendi the right to hold a thing for oneself

Jus alteri non habendi or Jus prohibendi the right to exclude

others from its use

In general, in a rei vindicatio action the plaintiffs case is based on his

paper title whereas the defendants case is based on prescriptive title.

Prescriptive title commences and endures through adverse possession,

not lawful possession. When the Court declares that title by prescription

is established, it transforms illegality into legality. As stated by

Udalagama J. in the Supreme Court case of Kiriamma v. Podibanda

[2005] BLR 9 at 11 considerable circumspection is necessary to recognize

the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party

having paper title. It is in fact said that title by prescription is an illegality

made legal due to the other party not taking action. This was quoted with

approval by Chithrasiri J. in Sumanawathie v. Sirisena (CA/830/98(F),

CA Minutes of 10.03.2014) and Salam J. in Fathima Naseera v. Mohamed

Haris (CA/818/96(F), CA Minutes of 11.07.2012).

Defendants evidence in a rei vindicatio action

Whilst emphasising that (a) the initial burden in a rei vindicatio action is

on the plaintiff to prove ownership of the property in suit and (b) the

standard of proof in a rei vindicatio action is proof on a balance of

probabilities, if the plaintiff in such an action has sufficient title or

superior title or better title than that of the defendant, the plaintiff

shall succeed. No rule of thumb can be laid down in what circumstances

the Court shall hold that the plaintiff has discharged his burden. Whether

or not the plaintiff proved his title shall be decided upon a consideration

of the totality of the evidence led in the case.

22 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

In making a determination in this regard, the Court is entitled to consider

evidence of all parties, including the evidence of the defendant. The oft-

quoted dicta of Herat J. in Wanigaratne v. Juwanis Appuhamy (1962) 65

NLR 167 that The defendant in a rei vindicatio action need not prove

anything, still less, his own title. The plaintiff cannot ask for a declaration

of title in his favour merely on the strength that the defendants title is poor

or not established. The plaintiff must prove and establish his title. should

not be misconstrued to imply that the Court is precluded from taking the

defendants evidence into consideration in arriving at the final conclusion

in a rei vindicatio action.

The dicta of Herath J. in Wanigaratne v. Juwanis Appuhamy (supra) is

eminently relevant to the facts of that particular case but has no

universal application to all rei vindicatio actions. Since it is a one-page

brief judgment, the facts are not very clear. However, as I understand,

the plaintiffs in that case had filed a rei vindicatio action against the

defendant on the basis that the defendant was a trespasser

notwithstanding that he (the defendant) had been in occupation of some

portions of the land for a considerable period of time. From the following

sentence found in the judgment, In this case, the plaintiffs produced a

recent deed in their favour and further stated in evidence that they could

not take possession of the shares purchased by them because they were

resisted by the 1st defendant, it is clear that the plaintiffs, if at all, had

only undivided rights in the land. It is also clear from the judgment that

whether or not the defendant also had undivided rights was not clear to

Court. It is in that context Herat J. states The learned District Judge, in

his judgment expatiates on the weakness of the defence case; but

unfortunately has failed to examine what title, if any, has been established

by the plaintiffs. No evidence of title has been established by the

plaintiffs in our opinion.

23 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

It may be noted that in Wanigaratnes case, the finding of the Supreme

Court is that No evidence of title has been established by the plaintiffs.

The facts are totally different in the instant case. In the instant case, by

way of the 3rd admission recorded at the trial, the 1st defendant admitted

that the 2nd defendant transferred the land to the plaintiff by deed No.

3016 marked at the trial as P3. The title of the plaintiff in the land was

never challenged by the defendant; nor did the defendant ever make a

claim for title to the land. The defendant is in unlawful occupation as he

has manifestly failed to prove any legal basis for his occupation of the

land of which the plaintiff is the paper title holder.

As this Court held in Wasantha v. Premaratne (SC/APPEAL/176/2014,

SC Minutes of 17.05.2021), the Court can in a rei vindicatio action

consider the evidence of the defendant in arriving at the correct

conclusion:

Notwithstanding that in a rei vindicatio action the burden is on the

plaintiff to prove title to the land no matter how fragile the case of

the defendant is, the Court is not debarred from taking into

consideration the evidence of the defendant in deciding whether or

not the plaintiff has proved his title. Not only is the Court not

debarred from doing so, it is in fact the duty of the Court to give due

regard to the defendants case, for otherwise there is no purpose in

a rei vindicatio action in allowing the defendant to lead evidence

when all he seeks is for the dismissal of the plaintiffs action.

This Court took the same view in Ashar v. Kareem

(SC/APPEAL/171/2019, SC Minutes of 22.05.2023).

Actio rei vindicatio and action in rem

In Pathirana v. Jayasundara (1955) 58 NLR 169 at 173 Gratiaen J. states:

24 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

A decree for a declaration of title may, of course, be obtained by way

of additional relief either in a rei vindicatio action proper (which is in

truth an action in rem) or in a lessors action against his overholding

tenant (which is an action in personam). But in the former case, the

declaration is based on proof of ownership in the latter, on proof of

the contractual relationship which forbids a denial that the lessor is

the true owner.

The fact that a rei vindicatio action is identified as an action in rem has

unmistakably contributed to the expectation of a high degree of proof of

title from a plaintiff in such an action. Is this thinking correct?

The phrase in rem requires an explanation rather than a definition. The

Latin term in rem derives from the word res, which means a thing or

an object whether movable or immovable. Actions in rem were originally

used as a means of protecting title to movables, especially slaves, because

land was not at first the object of private ownership Buckland and

McNair, Roman Law and Common Law Comparison (Cambridge

University Press, 1936) p. 6. Also, in rem jurisdiction is invoked in

maritime cases where a party could bring an action in rem against a ship

instead of the owner of the ship. It is the ship that suffers the

consequences in an action in rem. The owner suffers the consequences if

it is an action in personam.

Maasdorp (op. cit., Vol II, 8th Edition (1960), p.70) states The form of

action for the recovery of ownership was under the Roman law called

vindicatio rei, which was an action in rem, that is, aimed at the recovery of

the thing which is in the possession of another, whether such possession

was rightfully or wrongfully acquired, together with all its accretions and

fruits, and compensation in damages for any loss sustained by the owner

through having been deprived of it.

25 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

Blacks Law Dictionary, 11th edition, defines the term in rem as Latin

against a thing Involving or determining the status of a thing, and

therefore the rights of persons generally with respect to that thing. It

defines the term in personam as Latin against a person Involving or

determining the personal rights and obligations of the parties. (Of a legal

action) brought against a person rather than property.

The following passage of Dr. H. W. Tambiah (op. cit. p. 242) explains why

rei vindicatio is an action in rem.

The primary remedy granted to an owner against the person who

disputes his ownership is rei vindicatio. This Roman-Dutch Law

remedy has been adopted by the courts in Sri Lanka. Since the

owner, as dominus, has a right of possession, occupation and use of

the land, this action is in the nature of an action in rem. See Vulcan

Rubber Ltd. v. South African Railways and Harbours, 3 S.A. 285

(1958); Hissaias v. Lehman, 4 S.A. 715 (1958). In this type of action,

the owner of land whose title is disputed and who has been

unlawfully ejected, may bring an action for a declaration of title and

ejectment. If the owner has not been ejected but his title is disputed

he is entitled to bring a declaratory action to dismiss any disputes

to his title. Where an owner is unlawfully ejected he may bring an

action for declaration of title for mesne profits, damages and

ejectment.

In the case of Allis Appu v. Endris Hamy (1894) 3 SCR 87, Withers J.

categorised rei vindicatio both as an action in rem and action in personam:

Certain actions of an analogous nature apart, the action rei

vindicatio is allowed to the owner and to him alone. Lesion to the

right of property is of the very essence of the action and in that

respect constitutes it an action in rem. Lesion to the personal right of

26 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

the true proprietor properly constitutes a claim to compensation for

the produce of which he has been deprived by the possessor and in

that respect constitutes it an action in personam.

In classical Roman Law although actio rei vindicatio is classified as an

action in rem as opposed to an action in personam, the term action in

rem shall not be understood in the popular sense that we conceive it in

contemporary society. An action in rem means an action against a thing

whereas an action in personam means an action against a person. A

partition action is considered an action in rem in that the judgment in a

partition action has a binding effect on all persons having interests in the

property whether or not joined as parties to the action. It transcends the

characteristic of an inter partes action and assumes the characteristic of

an action in rem resulting in title good against the world. The scheme of

the Partition Law is designed to serve that purpose. But the entire world

is not bound by the judgment in a rei vindicatio action. The judgment in

a rei vindicatio action binds only the parties to the action and their

privies. In modern-day legal jargon, rei vindicatio is not an action in rem

but an action in personam.

The fact that rei vindicatio is not an action in rem in the popular sense is

reflected in the dicta of Dep C.J. in Preethi Anura v. William Silva (supra)

where in reference to the standard of proof in a rei vindicatio action it was

stated The plaintiffs task is to establish the case on a balance of

probability. In a partition case the situation is different as it is an action in

rem and the trial judge is required to carefully examine the title and the

devolution of title.

In Sithy Makeena v. Kuraisha [2006] 2 Sri LR 341 at 344, Imam J. with

Sriskandarajah J. in agreement stated It is well-settled law that only the

parties to a rei vindicatio action are bound by the decision in such a case,

27 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

as a rei vindicatio action is an action in personam and not an action in

rem.

In the Supreme Court case of Mojith Kumara v. Ariyaratne

(SC/APPEAL/123/2015, SC Minutes of 29.03.2016), the plaintiff filed

action seeking declaration of title to the land in suit, ejectment of the

defendants therefrom and damages. It was a rei vindicatio action proper.

The defendants sought dismissal of the plaintiffs action. The plaintiff

relied on a decree entered in his favour in a previous rei vindicatio action

filed against a different party, but in respect of the same land. The District

Court dismissed the plaintiffs action on the basis that the defendants

before Court were not parties to the previous action and therefore they

are not bound by that judgment. On appeal, the High Court set aside the

judgment of the District Court and held that the plaintiff can claim

ownership to the land on the strength of the previous decree apparently

on the basis that rei vindicatio is an action in rem. The Supreme Court

held that the previous rei vindicatio action is an action in personam and

not an action in rem and therefore third parties are not bound by that

judgment. Chitrasiri J. with the agreement of Aluwihare J. and De Abrew

J. held:

A decree in a case in which a declaration of title is sought binds only

the parties in that action. Such a proposition is not applicable when

it comes to a decree in rem which binds the whole world. Effects and

consequences of actions in rem and actions in personam are quite

different. Action in rem is a proceeding that determines the rights

over a particular property that would become conclusive against the

entire world such as the decisions in courts exercising admiralty

jurisdictions and the decisions in partition actions under the partition

law of this country. Procedure stipulated in Partition Law contains

provisions enabling interested parties to come before courts and to

28 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

join as parties to the action even though the plaintiff fails to make

them as parties to it. Therefore there is a rationale to treat the

decrees in partition cases as decrees in rem.

Actions in personam are a type of legal proceedings which can affect

the personal rights and interests of the property claimed by the

parties to the action. Such actions include an action for breach of

contract, the commission of a tort or delict or the possession of

property. Where an action in personam is successful, the judgment

may be enforced only against the defendants assets that include

real and personal or movable and immovable properties. Therefore,

a decree in a rei vindicatio action is considered as a decree that

would bind only the parties to the action. In the circumstances, it is

clear that the plaintiff cannot rely on the decree in 503/L to establish

rights to the property in question as against the defendants in this

case are concerned.

The greater includes the less

It may be recalled that in Preethi Anura v. William Silva (supra) Chief

Justice Dep stated that a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action need not

establish the title in the property with mathematical precision nor to prove

the case beyond reasonable doubt as in a criminal case. In a rei vindicatio

action the plaintiff need not strictly adhere to the exact manner in which

he has pleaded title in the plaint. For instance, if the plaintiff in the plaint

pleads title relying on one deed but at the trial marks several other deeds

that are duly listed to fortify his case, the Court need not mechanically

dismiss the plaintiffs action or disallow the plaintiff to mark those deeds

on the basis that the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action must prove title

strictly in the same manner which he has pleaded in the plaint. Even in

a criminal case or partition case such stringent procedure is not adopted.

This does not mean that the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action can present

29 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

a different case at the trial from what he has pleaded in his pleadings.

Suffice it to say, even that is possible, if issues are raised in that direction

and accepted by Court, for the case is tried not on pleadings but on

issues.

Stemming from the misconception that the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio

action shall strictly prove title exactly as pleaded in the plaint, a popular

argument mounted is that, if the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action had

come to Court seeking a declaration of title to the entire land and

ejectment of a trespasser from the whole or part of the land, but later if

the Court decides that the plaintiff is only a co-owner who is entitled to

undivided rights of the land, the Court shall dismiss the action since the

plaintiff came before the Court as the sole owner of the land.

If the plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action seeks a declaration of title to the

entire land, but at the end of the trial, if the Court finds that the plaintiff

is not entitled to the entire land but only to a portion of it, the Court need

not dismiss the action in toto. It is a recognised principle that when a

plaintiff has asked for a greater relief than he is actually entitled to, it

should not prevent him from getting the lesser relief which he is entitled

to. Non debet cui plus licet quod minus est non licere, also known as, Cui

licet quod majus non debet quod minus est non licere: the greater includes

the less. This is a well-established principle in law and also in consonance

with common sense. Vide King v. Kalu Banda (1912) 15 NLR 422 at 427,

Rodrigo v. Abdul Rahman (1935) 37 NLR 298 at 299, Police Sergeant,

Hambantota v. Simon Silva (1939) 40 NLR 534 at 538, Ibralebbe v. The

Queen (1963) 65 NLR 433 at 435, Abeynayake v. Lt. Gen. Rohan

LR 243 at 260-261, Attanayake v. Ramyawathie [2003] 1 Sri LR 401 at

409.

30 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

The finding that the plaintiff is entitled to a portion of the land means he

is a co-owner of the land. It is well-settled law that a co-owner can sue a

trespasser to have his title to the undivided share declared and for

ejectment of the trespasser from the whole land. This the plaintiff can do

by way of a rei vindicatio action.

In Hevawitarane v. Dangan Rubber Co. Ltd. (1913) 17 NLR 49 at 53 Wood

Renton A.C.J. declared:

Any co-owner, or party claiming under such a co-owner, is entitled

to eject a trespasser from the whole of the common property. (Unus

Lebbe v. Zayee (1893) 3 SCR 56, Greta v. Fernando (1905) 4 Bal.

100) Moreover, prima facie evidence of title is all that is required in

such an action.

In the same case, Pereira J. stated at page 55:

As regards the rights of owners of undivided shares of land to sue

trespassers, I have always understood the law, both before and

after the coming into operation of the Civil Procedure Code, to be that

the owner of an undivided share of land might sue a trespasser to

have his title to the undivided share declared and for ejectment of

the trespasser from the whole land, the reason for this latter right

being that the owner of the undivided share has an interest in every

part and portion of the entire land (see section 12, Civil Procedure

Code; Unus Lebbe v. Zayee (1893) 3 SCR 56; Greta v. Fernando

(1905) 4 Bal. 100; Arnolisa v. Dissan 4 NLR 163).

In Hariette v. Pathmasiri [1996] 1 Sri LR 358 at 362 the Supreme Court

quoted the said principle of law with approval. This was reiterated in

several decisions including Rosalin Hami v. Hewage Hami and Others

(SC/APPEAL/15/2008, SC Minutes of 03.12.2010) and Punchiappuhamy

v. Dingiribanda (SC/APPEAL/4/2010, SC Minutes of 02.11.2015).

31 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

Learned counsel for the defendant submits that since the plaintiff filed

this action rei vindicatio seeking a declaration of title to the lands

described in the schedules to the plaint and ejectment of the defendant

therefrom as the sole owner of the lands, but as conceded later, the

plaintiff is only entitled to 7/8 shares of each land, the plaintiffs action

must fail. Learned counsel says that this view was taken by the Supreme

Court in the case of Hariette v. Pathmasiri (supra). I am not inclined to

agree with this submission. As I have already explained, the plaintiff can

be granted the lesser relief. In any event, as I will explain below, the

Supreme Court in Hariettes case did not take such a view.

In Meera Lebbe Cassy Lebbe Marker v. Kalawilage Baba (1885) 7 SCC 97,

Dias J. held:

If the plaintiffs can establish their rights even to less than what they

claim, they may have a judgment for that reduced share. Though a

plaintiff cannot recover more than he claims, there is nothing to

prevent him recovering less.

Gunawardana J. in the case of Allis v. Seneviratne [1989] 2 Sri LR 335

at 337 observed:

The fact that the appellant has asked for a larger relief than he is

entitled to, should not in my view prevent him from getting the lesser

relief which he is entitled to.

In Chandrasiri Fernando v. Titus Wickramanayake [2012] BLR 344

Gooneratne J. at 346 quoted this with approval.

In the Supreme Court case of Punchiappuhamy v. Dingiribanda (supra)

the plaintiffs filed action seeking a declaration of title to the whole land

and ejectment of the defendant therefrom. The District Court granted

both reliefs. On appeal, the High Court reversed the judgment of the

32 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

District Court. Whilst dismissing the appeal on ejectment, Wanasundara

J. remarked: I am of the view that the Judges of the Civil Appellate High

Court should have granted a declaration of title only to 11/24th share of

the co-owned land of Belinchagahamula Hena to the Plaintiffs instead of

dismissing the action altogether. I hold that the Appellants are only entitled

to that relief and no more. Since it was not proved that the Defendant was

a trespasser, he cannot be ejected by the Plaintiffs.

Applicability of Hariette v. Pathmasiri

In actions rei vindicatio, defendants tend to rely on Hariette v. Pathmasiri

(supra) to argue that when a plaintiff in a rei vindicatio action seeks a

declaration of title to the entire land, his action must fail if he fails to

prove that he is the sole owner of the entire land. This in my view is a

misinterpretation of the judgment. In Hariettes case the Supreme Court

held at pages 362-363 as follows:

However, it has to be borne in mind that our law recognizes the right

of a co-owner to sue a trespasser to have his title to an undivided

share declared and for ejectment of the trespasser from the whole

land. In the case of Hevawitarana v. Dangan Rubber Co. Ltd 17 NLR

44 at 55, Pereira, J. stated as follows:-

I have always understood the law, both before and after the coming

into operation of the Civil Procedure Code, to be that the owner of an

undivided share of land might sue a trespasser to have his title to

the undivided share declared and for ejectment of the trespasser

from the whole land, the reason for this latter right being that the

owner of the undivided share has an interest in every part and

portion of the entire land.

In this case the Plaintiff is not seeking a declaration of title to her

undivided share in the land described in schedule 1 and for the

33 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

ejectment of the Defendant from that land. She has pleaded that she

possessed the land described in schedule 2 for and in lieu of her

undivided share and seeks the ejectment of the Defendant from that

land. Therefore the case for the Plaintiff cannot stop at adducing

evidence of paper title to an undivided share. It was her burden to

adduce evidence of exclusive possession and the acquisition of

prescriptive title by ouster in respect of the smaller land described in

schedule 2.

Since the prescriptive title to schedule 2 had not been proved, the

Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal and

dismissed the appeal.

If I may repeat for emphasis, in Hariettes case the plaintiff sought to eject

the defendant from the portion of land described in the second schedule

to the plaint (which was part of the larger land described in the first

schedule to the plaint) on the basis that she possessed the portion of the

land described in the second schedule to the plaint in lieu of her

undivided shares described in the first schedule to the plaint. The

Supreme Court held that the plaintiff failed to establish that she acquired

prescriptive title to that portion of land by ouster and therefore the

plaintiffs action cannot succeed.

Hariettes case was followed by the Supreme Court in Attanayake v.

Ramyawathie [2003] 1 Sri LR 401 where facts were similar. The Supreme

Court at page 403 summarised the issue in that case in the following

manner:

It was agreed by both counsel at the hearing, that the only issue

that has to be gone into is whether a co-owner of a land who sues

a trespasser for a declaration of title and ejectment is entitled to

34 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

maintain the action if he instituted action as the sole owner of the

premises.

This question was answered emphatically in the affirmative.

Bandaranayake J. (as she then was) stated at page 409:

I am of the firm view that, if an appellant had asked for a greater relief

than he is entitled to, the mere claim for a greater share in the land

should not prevent him, having a judgment in his favour for a lesser

share in the land. A claim for a greater relief than entitled to should

not prevent an appellant from getting a lesser relief. However, it is

necessary that the appellant adduces evidence of ownership for the

portion of land he is claiming for a declaration of title. It is amply clear

that the appellant in the instant case has not been able to adduce such

evidence.

In such circumstances the question raised by the counsel for the

appellant is answered in the following terms. A co-owner of a land who

sues a trespasser for a declaration of title and ejectment is entitled to

maintain the action even if he instituted the action as the sole owner of

the land and premises. The fact that an appellant has asked for greater

relief than he is entitled to, should not prevent him from getting the

lesser relief which he is entitled to.

However, as in Hariettes case, the Supreme Court was not inclined to

grant relief to the plaintiff-appellant because the plaintiff failed to prove

that he was entitled to the land described in schedule B to the plaint. The

reason was that the plaintiff sought a declaration of title and ejectment of

the defendant from the land described in schedule B to the plaint.

The facts in the present case are very much similar to that of

Harriettes case. As referred to earlier in the instant case the

appellant (the original plaintiff) had instituted action in the District

35 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

Court for a declaration of title and for ejectment from the land

morefully described in the Schedule B to the plaint of the respondent

therefrom. [page 406] However, it is necessary that the appellant

adduces evidence of ownership for the portion of land he is claiming

for a declaration of title. It is amply clear that the appellant in the

instant case has not been able to adduce such evidence. [page 409]

Learned counsel for the defendant contends that the High Court was

wrong when it stated that Hariette v. Pathmasiri has no application to the

instant case. I cannot agree.

The ratio decidendi in one case cannot be mechanically applied to decide

another case unless facts are similar. A principle of law laid down in a

decision must be understood in the light of facts and circumstances of

that particular case.

There are two schedules in the plaint of the instant action. However,

unlike in Hariettes case (and Attanayakes case), in the instant case, the

plaintiff sought declaration of title and ejectment from both lands which

are two separate allotments lot 6 in plan No. 467 in the first schedule

and lot 7 in the same plan in the second schedule. Hence the High Court

was correct in holding that Hariettes case has no direct applicability to

resolve the instant case.

These two judgments (Hariette v. Pathmasiri and Attanayake v.

Ramyawathie) unequivocally admit that a co-owner is entitled to:

(a) file an action seeking a declaration to his undivided rights of the land

and ejectment of a trespasser from the whole land; and

(b) successfully sue a trespasser for a declaration of title and ejectment

notwithstanding that he instituted the action as the sole owner of

the premises. This is based on the common-sense principle that

the greater includes the less.

36 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

If a co-owner of a land as the plaintiff can successfully sue a trespasser

for ejectment from the whole land notwithstanding that he initially

instituted the action as the sole owner of the land based on the common-

sense principle that the greater includes the less, the plaintiffs action

cannot and should not be dismissed if he seeks to eject a trespasser from

an identified portion of the whole land on the basis that he filed the action

as the sole owner of the identified portion of the land but he is in fact a

co-owner of that identified portion of the land. In such an event, the Court

can declare that the plaintiff is a co-owner of the whole land or of that

identified portion of the land and eject the trespasser on that basis.

Vendors duty to put the purchaser in possession

It is admitted that the owner transferred the property to the plaintiff by

deed No. 3016. The defendant does not have a deed of transfer in his

name. However, it is the position of the defendant that the owner placed

the defendant in possession prior to the execution of the said deed in

favour of the plaintiff. Hence learned counsel for the defendant argues

that the immediate cause of action accrued to the plaintiff is to seek a

refund of the purchase money and damages from the vendor. Learned

counsel for the defendant in his written submissions cites two authorities

in support Babaihamy v. Danchihamy (1913) 16 NLR 245 and Don

Seneris Appuhamy v. Guneris 1 Balasingham Reports 8.

The real dispute in those two cases was between the vendee and the

vendor, not between the vendee and a third party in possession.

In Appuhamy v. Appuhamy (1880) 3 SCC 61 the Full Bench of the

Supreme Court presided over by Cayley C.J. held:

The execution and delivery of a conveyance of land, the property of

the vendor, if in conformity with the Ordinance of frauds, transferred

the title to the land to the purchaser, although no corporeal delivery

37 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

or actual possession of the land had followed. And that by virtue

merely of the title so created, the purchaser might maintain an action

seeking for a declaration of title against a third party in possession

without title or under a weaker title.

In Punchi Hamy v. Arnolis (1883) 3 SCC 61 the Full Bench of the Supreme

Court presided over by Burnside C.J. held:

A purchaser of land who has a conveyance from his vendor, but has

never had any possession, may maintain an action to eject from the

land a third party claiming title adversely to the vendor.

This position has been followed in Latheef v. Mansoor (supra) wherein

Marsoof J. held at 352:

The action from which this appeal arises is not one falling within

these special categories, as admittedly, the Respondents had

absolutely no contractual nexus with the Appellants, nor had they at

any time enjoyed possession of the land in question. Of course, this

is not a circumstance that would deprive the Respondents to this

appeal from the right to maintain a vindicatory action, as it is trite

law in this country since the decisions of the Supreme Court in

Punchi Hamy v. Arnolis (1883) 5 SCC 160 and Allis Appu v. Edris

Hamy (1894) 3 SCR 87 that even an owner with no more than bare

paper title (nuda proprietas) who has never enjoyed possession

could lawfully vindicate his property subject to any lawful defence

such as prescription.

In Andris v. Siman (1889) 9 SCC 7 it was observed that, in an action rei

vindicatio, if the plaintiff seeks ejectment of the defendant on paper title,

title lies in deed only, and possession is not necessary to perfect it.

Burnside C.J. held if the plaintiff having failed to prove possession and

ouster, had relied on his paper title only to entitle him to possession, then

38 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

the question to be determined would have been whether the plaintiff had

succeeded in establishing a good paper title to the land as against the

defendants, whose actual possession was sufficient until the plaintiff had

proved good title.

The Full Bench of the Supreme Court presided over by Hutchinson C.J.

in Ratwatte v. Dullewe (1907) 10 NLR 304 held Where the question is

between a purchaser and a third party, the delivery of the deed of transfer

is sufficient to entitle the purchaser to maintain an action, as owner,

against such third party. Middleton J. stated at page 309:

It seems to be good and settled law (Appuhamy v. Appuhamy (1880)

3 SCC 61 following Don Andris v. Illangakoon (1857) 2 Lor. 49) that

the execution and delivery of conveyance of land in conformity with

the Statute of Frauds confers the dominium on the purchaser, and

so gives him title to maintain an action against a third party in

possession without or under a weaker title.

I have no doubt therefore that if the plaintiff [purchaser] here and

accepted the conveyance tendered by the defendant [vendor], he

might maintain his action against Dullewe [third party] for

declaration of title, and might have called upon his vendor to warrant

and defend the title conferred.

As held in Luwis Singho and Others v. Ponnamperuma (supra) by

Wigneswaran J. at 324-325:

But in a rei vindicatio action, the cause of action is based on the sole

ground of violation of the right of ownership. In such an action proof

is required that;

(i) the Plaintiff is the owner of the land in question i.e. he has

the dominium and,

39 SC/APPEAL/57/2016

(ii) that the land is in the possession of the Defendant (Voet

6:1:34)

Thus even if an owner never had possession of a land in question it

would not be a bar to a vindicatory action.

It is true that it is the duty of the vendor to deliver possession of the

property to the vendee at the time of the sale, and warrant and defend

the title when a third party challenges the title of the vendee. However,

merely because the vendor does not deliver possession of the property to

the vendee at the time of the sale, the sale does not become ineffective or

unenforceable against third parties, nor does the vendee become a

speculative buyer. The vendee can either sue the vendor seeking

rescission of the sale and a refund of the purchase price together with

damages or sue the trespassers for a declaration of title and ejectment,

and defend his title with the assistance of the vendor.

the negative. I affirm the judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal and

dismiss the appeal with costs.
