"[…] [T]he Court has to apply an objective test when determining this question."
"Accordingly,  the  Court  has  to  place  more  reliance  on  facts  that  can  be"
"ascertained from the evidence rather than unsubstantiated claims made from"
"the witness box. The Court has to keep in mind that, a notarially attested deed"
"of transfer should not be lightly declared to be a nullity. The Court must also"
"guard against allowing a false or belated claim of `Trust’ made by a transferor"
"who  has  transferred  his  property  and  then  had  second  thoughts  or  seeks  to"
"profit from changed circumstances.”(emphasis added)"
