"විත්තිකරු විසින්  පැමිණිලිකාරියවේ  වාසියට  වූ  අනුමිත  බාරයක්  වෙස  පැමිණිල්වල්  2"

"It is evident that the Plaintiff's case was based on a constructive trust. Nonetheless,"
"both  the  District  Court  and  the  High  Court  seem  to  have  proceeded  without  fully"
"comprehending the distinction between an express trust and a constructive trust."
"Undoubtedly, Section 97 of the Trusts Ordinance declares that the duties, liabilities,"
"and disabilities of a trustee under both an express and an implied trust are the same."
"There is no universal consensus on the meaning of express trust and constructive trust."
"Still,  there  is  a  distinction.  The  intention  of  the  settlor  to  establish  a  trust  is  the"
"foundation of an express trust. On the other hand, a constructive trust arises from the"
"operation of law. As Birks states [Peter Birks, An Introduction to the Law of Restitution"
"(Revised Ed. Oxford University Press, 1989, page 65)] “[T]here is a fine but important"
"distinction between [positive] intent conceived as creative of rights [for express trusts]"
"…  and  [positive]  intent  conceived  as  a  fact  which,  along  with  others,  calls  for  the"
"creation  of  rights  [through  a  constructive  trust]”.  Hence,  although  it  may  be  a  fine"
