"guard against allowing a false or belated claim of `Trust’ made by a transferor"
"who  has  transferred  his  property  and  then  had  second  thoughts  or  seeks  to"
"profit from changed circumstances.”(emphasis added)"
"On  the  issue  of  possession,  the  Plaintiff  maintained  that  she  continued  to  be  in"
"possession of the corpus even after the execution of deed Nos. 5858(P2) and 105(P3)."
"The 1st Defendant contested this and claimed that he had plucked the coconuts from"
"the corpus. The 2nd Defendant claimed that he was in possession and that he started"
"clearing  the  land  to  build  a  house  in  2006  when  the  Plaintiff  filed  this  action  and"
"obtained an enjoining order in the first instant. It was later dissolved."
"In determining who was in possession of the corpus, an important fact that must not"
"be overlooked is that it is part of a larger land that is co-owned property. As a co-owner,"
"the Plaintiff sold an undivided 20 perches to the 1st Defendant."
"No  doubt  both  the  1st  and  2nd  Defendants  claimed  that  what  was  sold  to  the  2nd"
"Defendant was a divided and defined portion of land. This is untenable as a matter of"
"law. There was no partition decree, deed of partition, or other method accepted in law"
"that ended co-ownership.  Hence, the corpus continued to be part of the co-owned"
"property."
"A co-owner’s possession is in law the possession of all the other co-owners. Every co-"
"owner is presumed to be in possession in his capacity as a co-owner. Therefore, even"
"if the claim of the Plaintiff is accepted, she continued to possess as a co-owner and her"
"possession is in law also the possession of the 1st and 2nd Defendants. I am therefore"
"of the view that although the Plaintiff may be able to claim that she continued to be in"
"possession of the corpus after  deed Nos. 5858(P2) and 105(P3) were executed, her"
"possession is also the possession of the 1st and 2nd Defendants."
