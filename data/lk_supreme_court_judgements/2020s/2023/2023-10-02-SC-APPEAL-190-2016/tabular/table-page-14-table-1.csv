"later date but it certainly cannot, in my opinion, be a statutory requirement that"
"to effect its passing there must be some writing under section 53(l)(c).‚Äù"
"Although this pronouncement was upon the necessity to comply with  section 53 of"
"the Law of Property Act 1925 of England, the principle enunciated is applicable to the"
"instant case. Where it can be shown that the beneficial owner directed the trustee to"
"transfer the legal interest in the trust to a third party so that the third party becomes"
"both the beneficial and legal owner, no further documentation is needed secure the"
"title of the third party. Any trust that existed as between the trustee and the beneficial"
"owner ceases to exist and the third party becomes the absolute owner of the trust"
"property."
"In the instant case, the Plaintiff admitted that she signed as a witness to the execution"
"of  deed  No.  105(P3)  dated  27.05.2003  whereby  title  was  passed  on  to  the  2nd"
"Defendant. However, she claimed that her signature was obtained on a blank paper."
"The Plaintiff alleged that the notary who attested it, G.K. Gunasekera, Notary Public,"
"had told her to sign since she admitted to borrowing money. She claimed that she got"
"to know about this deed only when the 2nd Defendant began clearing the land in July"
"2006."
"Nevertheless, the Plaintiff did not make any complaint against the said notary to either"
"the Police or any other body. In fact, a copy of that deed was obtained by her from the"
"said G.K. Gunasekera, Notary Public. Moreover, the Plaintiff had sold another portion"
"of land to one Ravindra Tissalal in 2002 by deed No. 6053 (V1) which was attested by"
"M.A.N.A. Marasinghe, Notary Public who attested deed No. 5858(P2). It appears that"
"the said land was reconveyed to the Plaintiff by deed No. 107(P6) dated 31.05.2003"
"attested  by  the  very  same  G.K.  Gunasekera,  Notary  Public  who  attested  deed  No."
"105(P3)."
"It  is  inconceivable  that  the  Plaintiff  would  go  to  the  same  notary,  who  allegedly"
"obtained  her  signature  on  a  blank  paper,  four  days  thereafter  to  execute  deed  No."
"107(P6) dated 31.05.2003 to get title reconveyed to her by Ravindra Tissalal."
