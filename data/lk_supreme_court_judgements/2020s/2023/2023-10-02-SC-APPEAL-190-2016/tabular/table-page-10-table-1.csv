"He states:"
"“If there is a trust, the contractual rule that time is of the essence of the contract"
"would be relevant and it would be unnecessary to insist that the purchase money"
"should be tendered within the specified period. If this is so, a trust under 83 will"
"also  arise  where  a  person  has  transferred  property  subject  to  a  notarial"
"agreement because the period has elapsed. But if within a reasonable period"
"the purchase price has not been repaid it may be assumed that the transferor"
"has no intention of exercising the right of repurchase and has therefore parted"
"with the beneficial interest.”"
"The Plaintiff testified that she remained in possession of the corpus notwithstanding"
"the execution of deed Nos. 5858(P2) and 105(P3). Both the learned trial judge and the"
"judges of the High Court did not evaluate this evidence."
"Moreover, the Plaintiff testified that the value of one perch of land in the area at the"
"time  of  execution  of  deed  No.  5858(P2)  was  around  Rs.  20,000/=  to  30,000/=."
"According  to  that  deed  the  consideration  paid  for  an  undivided  20  perches  was  Rs."
"40,000/=. The Plaintiff also called a valuer, Jagath Liyanaarchchi, to testify to the value"
"of the corpus at the time of the execution of deed No. 5858(P2). According to him, the"
"value of a perch of the corpus at that time was around Rs. 20,000/=. The learned trial"
"judge makes a superficial statement about the value of the corpus without analysing"
"the  valuer's  evidence.  It  amounts  to  a  failure  to  properly  evaluate  whether  the"
"consideration expressed on the deed is utterly inadequate to what would be the fair"
"purchase price for the property conveyed."
"Accordingly, both the learned trial judge and the judges of the  High Court failed to"
"consider  whether  there  were,  and  if  so,  what  attendant  circumstances  there  were,"
"when  deed  No.  5858(P2)  was  executed,  from  which  it  could  be  inferred  that  the"
"Plaintiff did not intend to dispose of the beneficial interest on the interests conveyed"
