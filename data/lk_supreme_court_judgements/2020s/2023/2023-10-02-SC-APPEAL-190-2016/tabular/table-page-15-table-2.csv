"In  Senadheerage  Chandrika  Sudarshani  v.  Muthukuda  Herath  Mudiyanselage"
"Gedara Somawathi (supra) it was held (at page 15) that:"
"“If  the  attendant  circumstances  unequivocally  point  to  that  conclusion,  a"
"Constructive Trust would have arisen. However, if the attendant circumstances"
"fail to unequivocally establish that the owner did not intend to dispose of his"
"beneficial interest or, in other words, there is a doubt as to the conclusion which"
"can be drawn from the attendant circumstances, a Court should, usually, reject"
"the claim that, a Constructive Trust exists.”"
