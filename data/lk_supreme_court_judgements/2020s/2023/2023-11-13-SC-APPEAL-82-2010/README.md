Introduction

This partition case has a checkered history. The plaintiffs filed this action

in the District Court of Ratnapura to partition the land known as

Madawatta described in the schedule to the plaint in accordance with the

Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 among the plaintiffs and the 1st-8th

defendants. The 1st-8th defendants in their joint statement of claim inter

alia took up the position that since this land is subject to service

(rajakariya) to the Sabaragamu Maha Saman Devalaya, the plaintiffs

cannot maintain this action as partition cannot be sought for land

subject to such service.

Subsequently, upon the application of the 1st-8th defendants, the

Basnayake Nilame of Sabaragamu Maha Saman Devalaya was added as

the 9th defendant. He submitted that partition is possible subject to

service. At the trial, all parties agreed that this land is subject to service

to the Sabaragamu Maha Saman Devalaya and recorded it as a formal

admission.

7

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

The 1st-8th defendants raised issue Nos. 14-26 and the 17th issue was on

this question as to whether this land which is subject to service

(rajakariya) to the Sabaragamu Maha Saman Devalaya can be partitioned

according to the Partition Law. The trial proceeded and the plaintiffs

closed their case. Thereafter, the Attorney-at-Law for the 1st-8th

defendants made a belated application to try issue No. 17 as a

preliminary question of law.

The learned District Judge by order dated 01.11.2004 answered this

issue in the negative and dismissed the plaintiffs action on the basis that

the District Court has no jurisdiction to partition a land subject to

rajakariya notwithstanding that the ninda lord consents to partition. On

appeal, the Court of Appeal by judgment dated 12.01.2010 affirmed the

order of the District Court. Thereafter, on 06.08.2010, the Court of

Appeal granted leave to appeal against its own judgment to the Supreme

Court.

The feudal land tenure system

The feudal land tenure system in Sri Lanka, commonly referred to as the

rajakariya system, is a historical one that started well before the

colonial periods.

The Sinhala king was the lord paramount of all the land in the country.

On this basis king granted away whole villages to temples or individual

persons on sannasa (), royal grant etc., though much of the land

was already held by private parties. A village () so granted to a temple

is viharagama () or dewalagama (), and a village granted

to an individual is nindagama (). The proprietor of a viharagama,

dewalagama or nindagama was known as ninda proprietor or ninda lord.

Each such village consisted of a number of holdings or allotments and

each such holding was known as panguwa (). The ninda lord could

8

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

assign such holdings to people subject to service (rajakariya). Such

people are known as nilakarayas (). Nilakarayas were of two

kinds, namely paraveni nilakaraya ( ) and maruwena

nilakaraya ( ). Paraveni nilakarayas panguwa is known

as paraveni panguwa ( ) whereas maruwena nilakarayas

panguwa is known as maruvena panguwa ( ). Paraveni

nilakarayas are those who held their lands before the nindagama or

viharagama or dewalagama was granted to the ninda lord, and maruvena

nilakarayas are those who received their lands from the ninda lord

subsequent to the royal grant. Paraveni nilakarayas are hereditary

holders in perpetuity of the pangu subject to the performance of different

services to the ninda lord who could be the chief of the temple or

dewalaya. In practical terms, maruwena nilakarayas also fall into the

same category. However, paraveni nilakaraya is now statutorily

recognised as a holder of a paraveni pangu in perpetuity by section 2 of

the Service Tenures Ordinance No. 4 of 1870.

The excerpts, observations and dicta found in the Full Bench decision in

Appuhamy v. Menike (1917) 19 NLR 361 throw some light to better

understand this ancient system. In this judgment, Ennis J. states at 362-

363:

Burge (vol. IV, p. 68), speaking of the hereditary tenure under the

Sinhalese kings, says: The king was the lord paramount of the soil,

which was possessed by hereditary holders on the condition of

doing service according to their caste. The liability to perform

service was not a personal obligation, but attached to the

landBesides the land thus held by the ordinary peasant

proprietors, there were the estates of the crown, of the church, and

the chiefs. These are known as gabadagam, royal villages;

viharagam and dewalagam, villages belonging to Buddhist

9

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

monasteries and temples (dewala); and nindagam, villages of large

proprietors. These last were ancestral property of the chiefs, or were

originally royal villages bestowed from time to time on favourites of

the court. In these estates certain portionswere retained for the

use of the palacewhile the rest was given out in parcels to

cultivators, followers, and dependents, on conditionperforming

various servicesThese followers or dependents had at first no

hereditary title to the parcels of land thus allotted to them. These

allotments, however, generally passed from father to son, and in

course of time hereditary title was in fact acquired. The real status

of these followers was thus well described in 1824 by Mr. Wright,

the Revenue Commissioner. Writing of the followers of the chief, he

says: They are in fact servants by inheritance, whose wages are

paid in lieu of money, and though he has the power of dismissing

them and transferring their land to others if he pleases, this is

seldom or rarely ever excised; they leaving in most instances a kind

of birthright, by long residence and possession, living happily and

contented in performing all the customary services which by the

tenure of these lands they are bound to perform to their chief.

Pereira in his Collection (Pereira 303) says: The only paraveni

tenants were those who were on the land prior to the grant of the

village to the ninda lord.

The word paraveni imports a right in perpetuity (Weerasinghe v.

De Silva 6 S.C.C.17). It would seem then that historically paraveni

nilakarayas were originally hereditary holders under the king before

the grant of the royal village to the ninda lord. Thereafter certain

followers were given allotments (panguwa) by the lord, and in the

course of years the holders of these allotments assimilated their

tenure to that of the original paraveni tenants, i.e., the holding

10

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

became heritable and alienable, and the holders acquired by

prescription all the rights the original paraveni tenants under the

king.

In the same judgment, De Sampayo J. states at 367-368:

The theory of the old Sinhalese constitution, as much as that of the

English constitution, was that the king was the lord paramount of

all the land, and on this basis the Sinhalese king granted away

whole villages to temples or individual persons, though much of the

land was already held by private parties. A village so granted to a

temple is a viharagama or dewalagama, and a village granted to an

individual is a nindagama. The proprietor of a temple village or a

nindagama would also, after the grant, assign portions to tenants

subject to service. Sir John DOyleys Notes quoted by Marshall state

(see Marshalls Judgments 300) that paraveni tenants are those who

held their lands before the nindagama or the temple village was

granted to the proprietor, and maruvena tenants are those who

receive their panguwas from the proprietor subsequent to the grant.

This is confirmed by the Service Tenures Commissioners, who in

their report (see Pereiras Collection 303) say that the only paraveni

tenants were those who were on the land prior to the grant of the

village to the ninda lord or vihare or dewale. With regard to the

nature of tile paraveni tenants right, Sawers (see Marshalls

Judgments 307), after stating that a person having the absolute

possession of (and right to) real or personal property has the power

to dispose of such property unlimitedly, adds but to the unlimited

power of disposing of landed property there was this exception, that

lands liable to rajakariya, or any public service to the Crown, or to a

superior, could not be disposed of either by gift, sale, or request to a

11

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

vihare or dewale without the sanction of the king, or the superior to

whom the service was due.

Basnayake C.J. in Herath v. Attorney General (1958) 60 NLR 193 at 205-

206 traced the history of this ancient system in the following terms:

A village or gama in respect of which services (rajakariya) were per-

formed are of four kinds, viz., gabadagama, nindagama,

viharagama, and dewalagama. A gabadagama is a royal village

which was the exclusive property of the Sovereign. The Royal Store

or Treasury was supplied from the gabadagama, which the tenants

had to cultivate gratuitously in consideration of being holders of

praveni panguwas. A nindagama is a village granted by the

Sovereign to a chief or noble or other person on a sannasa or grant.

Similarly, a village granted by the Sovereign to a vihare is a

viharagama and to a dewale is a dewalagama. Each gama or village

consisted of a number of holdings or minor villages. Each such

holding or minor village was known as a panguwa. Each panguwa

consisted of a number of fields and gardens. Panguwas were of two

kinds, viz., praveni or paraveni panguwa and maruwena panguwa.

A praveni panguwa is a hereditary holding and a maruwena

panguwa is a holding given out to a tenant for each cultivation year

or for a period of years. The holder of a panguwa was known as a

nilakaraya. They were of two kinds: Praveni or paraveni

nilakarayas and maruwena nilakarayas. The praveni nilakarayas

are generally those who were holders of panguwas prior to the Royal

Grant and the ninda lord is not free to change them. They were free

to transmit their lands to their male heirs, but were not free to sell or

mortgage their rights. They were obliged to perform services in

respect of their panguwas. The services varied according as the

ninda lord was an individual, a vihare or a dewale. In the case of

12

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

vihares or dewales personal services were such as keeping the

buildings in repair, cultivating the fields of the temple, preparing the

daily dana, participating in the annual procession, and performing

services at the daily pooja of the vihare or dewale. In the scheme of

land tenure the panguwa though consisting of extensive lands is

indivisible and the nilakarayas are jointly and severally liable to

render services or pay dues. Though the panguwa was indivisible,

especially after a praveni nilakarayas right to sell, gift, devise, and

mortgage his panguwa came to be recognised, the practice came into

existence of different persons who obtained rights from a nilakaraya

occupying separate allotments of land for convenience of possession.

The maruwena nilakaraya though known as a tenant-at-will held on

a tenancy which lasted at least for one cultivation year at a time.

Unlike the praveni nilakaraya he could be changed by the ninda

lord; but it was seldom done. He went on year after year, but was

not entitled to transmit his rights to his heirs. On the death of a

maruwena tenant his heirs are entitled to continue only if they

receive the tenancy. Though in theory maruwena tenure was

precarious, in fact it was not so. So long as he paid his dues the

ninda lord rarely disturbed him. Besides the praveni and maruwena

panguwas in a nindagama, viharagama or dewalagama, there were

also lands owned absolutely by the ninda lord both ownership and

possession being in him.

In addition, the king preserved some lands for himself that were known

as gabadagam () for the works of the royal palace. With the

disappearance of kings as rulers, gabadagam also disappeared.

The abolition of the feudal land tenure system in Sri Lanka occurred in

stages over time. The British colonial administration introduced certain

land reforms during their rule, which began in the early 19th century. In

13

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

1832, the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission implemented land reforms

with the objective of abolishing the feudal land tenure system. The shift

from the old system to the new one was a gradual and complex process.

The Service Tenures Ordinance No. 4 of 1870 came into being in order

to define the services due by the paraveni tenant of wiharagama,

dewalagama and nindagama lands and to provide for the commutation of

those services. The following definitions were given by section 2 of the

Ordinance.

maruwena nilakaraya shall mean the tenant at will of a

maruwena pangu.

maruwena pangu shall mean an allotment or share of land in a

temple or nindagama village held by one or more tenants at will.

nindagama proprietor shall mean any proprietor of nindagama

entitled to demand services from any praveni nilakaraya or

maruwena nilakaraya, for and in respect of a praveni pangu or

maruwena pangu held by him.

praveni nilakaraya shall mean the holder of a praveni pangu in

perpetuity, subject to the performance of certain services to the

temple or nindagama proprietor.

praveni pangu shall mean an allotment or share of land in a temple

or nindagama village held in perpetuity by one or more holders,

subject to the performance of certain services to the temple or

nindagama proprietor.

temple shall include wihara and dewala.

wiharagama proprietor or dewalagama proprietor shall include

the officer of any wihara or dewala respectively entitled to demand

14

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

services from any praveni nilakaraya or maruwena nilakaraya, for

and in respect of a praveni pangu or maruwena pangu held by him.

After the enactment of the Service Tenures Ordinance, the performance

of services is not compulsory. Instead, sections 9, 10 and 14 provided for

the commutation of nilakarayas services by payment of money and

section 24 imposed a period of limitation of one year in the case of the

recovery of arrears of personal services and two years in the case of

commuted dues. The right to recovery of services or dues if not enforced

for ten years was to result in the loss forever of the ninda lords rights in

respect of the pangu. Section 25 also deprived the ninda lord of the right

to proceed to ejectment against the nilakaraya on his failure to render

personal services or to pay commutation.

Sections 9, 10, 14, 24 and 25 of the Service Tenure Ordinance read as

follows:

9. On the day appointed in such notice the commissioners shall enter

into their inquiries, and shall then, or on such other early day as

they shall then and there from time to time publicly appoint, hear,

try, and determine as follows:-

(a) the tenure of each pangu subject to service in the village, whether

it be praveni or maruwena;

(b) the names, so far as the same can be ascertained, of the

proprietors and holders of each praveni pangu;

(c) the nature and extent of the services due for each praveni pangu;

(d) the annual amount of money payment for which such services

may be fairly commuted at the time the registries are made.

15

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

And their determination shall be final and conclusive in that or any

future proceeding, whether before the said commissioners or any

other judicial tribunal, as to the tenure of the pangus in such village,

whether it be praveni or maruwena, the nature of the service due for

and in respect of each praveni pangu, and the annual amount of

money payment for which the services due for each praveni pangu

may be fairly commuted at the time those registries are made.

10. So soon as the commissioners shall complete their inquiry into

the claims in any village, they shall cause to be numbered and

entered in a book of registry a list of praveni pangus in such village,

and shall further cause to be entered the names, so far as the same

can be ascertained, of the proprietors and tenants of each pangu,

the nature and extent of the services due for such pangu, and the

annual amount of money payment for which such services may be

fairly commuted at the time the registry is made, and shall duly sign

such registry and transmit the same to the kachcheri of the district.

14. If any praveni nilakaraya shall be desirous of commuting any

service as aforesaid for a money payment, he shall, during the

pendency of the commission (and the commission shall be held to be

pending until the Governor-General[3] shall declare it to be at an end

by notice in the Gazette), transmit to the commissioners, and, after

the close of the commission, to the Government Agent of the district

in which the praveni pangu is situated, an application in writing to

that effect, which application shall set forth the name of the party

making it, the name and number of the pangu in respect of which

such service may be due, and the name of the village in which the

same is situated. If there be more than one praveni nilakaraya in

any praveni pangu, the application to commute must be made or

acquiesced in by a majority of the entire number of nilakarayas who

16

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

shall have attained the age of sixteen years. The commissioners or

the Government Agent to whom such application shall be made shall

issue a notice to the proprietor of the pangu, informing him that, on

a day to be named in such notice, the application will be considered

and determined upon. A copy of the application must be served with

the notice.

24. Arrears of personal services in cases where the praveni

nilakaraya shall not have commuted shall not be recoverable for any

period beyond a year; arrears of commuted dues, where the praveni

nilakaraya shall have commuted, shall not be recoverable for any

period beyond two years. If no services shall have been rendered,

and no commuted dues be paid for ten years, and no action shall

have been brought therefor, the right to claim services or commuted

dues shall be deemed to have been lost forever, and the pangu shall

be deemed free thereafter from any liability on the part of the

nilakarayas to render services or pay commuted dues therefor:

Provided, however, that if at the time of such right of action accruing

the proprietor shall not be resident within Ceylon, or if by reason of

his minority or insanity he shall be disabled from instituting such

action, the period of prescription of such action shall begin to run, in

every such case, from the time when such absence or disability shall

have ceased.

25. It shall be lawful for any proprietor to recover damages in any

competent court against the holder or holders of any praveni pangu

who shall not have commuted, and who shall have failed to render

the services defined in the registry herein before referred to. In

assessing such damages, it shall be competent for the court to award

not only the sum for which the services shall have been assessed by

the commissioners for the purpose of perpetual commutation, but

17

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

such further sum as it shall consider fair and reasonable to cover the

actual damages sustained by the proprietor through the default of

the nilakaraya or nilakarayas to render such personal services at

the time when they were due; but it shall not be lawful for any

proprietor to proceed to ejectment against his praveni nilakaraya for

default of performing services or paying commuted dues; the value

of those services or dues shall be recoverable against such

nilakaraya by seizure and sale of the crop of fruits on the pangu, or

failing these, by the personal property of such nilakaraya, or failing

both, by a sale of the pangu, subject to the personal services, or

commuted dues in lieu thereof, due thereon to the proprietor. The

proceeds of such sale are to be applied in payment of the amount

due to the proprietor, and the balance, if any, shall be paid to the

evicted nilakarayas, unless there should be any puisne incumbrance

upon the holding, in which case such balance shall be applied to

satisfy such incumbrance.

Nearly after a century from this Ordinance, Nindagama Lands Act No. 30

of 1968 became part of our law. In terms of section 29 of the Act, the

Service Tenures Ordinance ceased to apply to any nindagama land. The

Nindagama Lands Act was passed for the abolition of services due in

respect of nindagama lands and for the declaration of tenants or holders

as owners of such lands.

Sections 2-5 of the Nindagama Lands Act read as follows:

2. The services due from any tenant or holder of any nindagama

land to any proprietor thereof are hereby abolished, and accordingly-

(a) no such proprietor shall be entitled to demand the performance of

such services or to demand or receive any sum of money (due or

18

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

which may fall due) in commutation of such services, from any

tenant or holder thereof; and

(b) no such tenant or holder shall be liable to perform such services,

or ten to pay such sum of money.

3. Every tenant or holder of any nindagama land is hereby declared

to be the owner thereof.

4. No tenant or holder of any nindagama land shall be liable to pay

compensation to the proprietor thereof or to any other person for any

loss or damage incurred or suffered by such proprietor or other

person, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of the abolition of

the services due by such tenant or holder in respect of that land.

5. No tenant or holder of any nindagama land shall be liable to pay

compensation to the proprietor thereof or to any other person for any

loss or damage incurred or suffered by such proprietor or other

person, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of his becoming an

owner thereof.

However, according to the definition given to the term nindagama land

in section 31 of the Nindagama Lands Act, viharagam and devalagam are

unaffected by the Act.

nindagama land means any land in respect of which a proprietor

thereof was, prior to the date of the commencement of this Act,

entitled to demand services from any praveni nilakaraya or

maruwena nilakaraya for and in respect of a praveni pangu or

maruwena pangu held by any such nilakaraya, or to demand or

receive from any such nilakaraya any sum of money in commutation

of any such services, but does not include viharagama or

devalagama land.

19

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

The Land Reform Law No. 1 of 1972 represented a significant step

towards the further abolition of feudal land tenure.

Partition Law and the position of paraveni nilakaraya

The oldest Ordinance which governed partition proceedings was

Ordinance No. 21 of 1844.

This Ordinance was replaced by the Partition Ordinance No. 10 of 1863.

These two Ordinances did not contain any special provision regarding the

competency of a paraveni nilakaraya to partition a pangu land.

In Jotihamy v. Dingirihamy (1906) 3 Balasinghams Reports 67, the

question whether a paraveni nilakaraya can file a partition action to

partition a paraveni pangu was considered. The Court answered the

question in the negative on two grounds: firstly, the paraveni nilakaraya

lacks full dominium in the property, and secondly, the service required

from them is indivisible. It is worth quoting the full judgment delivered

by Wendt J. with the agreement of Middleton J. as some of the later cases

followed this judgment without any hesitation.

This is an action of the most novel kind, and in all my experience I

have never known another like it. Shortly, this is an application by

a man, who has purchased an undivided share of a Panguwa in a

Nindagama that is to say, the interest of one of the Nilakarayo. The

first question that suggests itself to me is whether the lands can be

said to belong to the parties within the meaning of the Partition

Ordinance. The Ordinance has hitherto been regarded as requiring

nothing short of the full dominium. Now the dominium in Service

Tenures land is generally regarded as vested in the person usually

described as proprietor of the Nindagama, or the over lord, while the

Nilakarayo are similarly spoken of as tenants. I do not of course

20

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

forget that the interests of a Paraveny Nilakaraya cannot be

determined against his will by a proprietor although upon the non-

performance of services judgment can be recovered for damages and

the interest of the tenant sold up and so brought to an end. But I do

not see that this makes a tenant an owner; he cannot therefore claim

partition of the land. Another objection is based upon the

indivisibility of the services. Counsel on both sides were allowed the

opportunity of looking into the authorities on this point but have not

been able to produce anything which recognises the right of a tenant

to maintain a partition action. We are therefore invited to decide the

appeal upon general principles. Applying these to the best of our

ability we think that the provisions of the Partition Ordinance do not

apply to lands of the character of those in question. We therefore

reverse the decree appealed from and dismiss the action with costs.

The question whether a paraveni nilakaraya can file a partition action to

partition a paraveni pangu was addressed in the Partition Act No. 16 of

1951. Section 54 of the Act expressly recognised the right of the paraveni

nilakaraya to institute a partition action:

54(1). Every praveni nilakaraya shall, for the purposes of this Act,

be deemed to be a co-owner of the praveni panguwa of which he is

a shareholder and shall be entitled to institute a partition action to

obtain a decree for the partition or sale of that panguwa or of any of

the lands in that panguwa.

(2). The rights of the proprietor of a nindagama shall in no way be

affected by the partition or sale under this Act of a panguwa or of

any of the lands in a panguwa, and that proprietor shall be entitled

to exercise those rights as though that partition or sale had not

occurred.

21

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

(3). In this section, the expressions praveni nilakaraya and

praveni panguwa have the meanings respectively assigned to

them in section 2 of the Service Tenures Ordinance.

Section 48(1) of the Partition Act No. 16 of 1951 which recognised finality

of interlocutory and final decrees of partition free from all encumbrances

whatsoever other than those specified in that decree, further

acknowledged that the rights of a proprietor of a nindagama was

unaffected whether or not it is specified in the decree.

Section 48(1) read as follows:

48(1). Save as provided in subsection (3) of this section, the

interlocutory decree entered under section 26 and the final decree of

partition entered under section 36 shall, subject to the decision on

any appeal which may be preferred therefrom, be good and

sufficient evidence of the title of any person as to any right share or

interest awarded therein to him and be final and conclusive for all

purposes against all persons whomsoever, whatever right, title or

interest they have, claim to have, to or in the land to which such

decrees relate and notwithstanding any omission or defect of

procedure or in the proof of title adduced before the court or the fact

that all persons concerned are not parties to the partition action; and

the right, share or interest awarded by any such decree shall be free

from all encumbrances whatsoever other than those specified in that

decree.

In this subsection encumbrance means any mortgage, lease,

usufruct, servitude, fideicommissum, life interest, trust, or any

interest whatsoever howsoever arising except a constructive or

charitable trust, a lease at will or for a period not exceeding one

month, and the rights of a proprietor of a nindagama.

22

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

The Partition Act No. 16 of 1951 was replaced by the Partition Law No.

21 of 1977, which represents the current law governing partition actions.

However, the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977, does not contain a provision

similar to that of section 54 of the Partition Act No. 16 of 1951. I am

aware that as a general principal the Court cannot assume a mistake in

an Act of Parliament. Nevertheless, several reasons can be attributed to

this omission.

One is, on 25.07.1960, the Privy Council, which was the highest Court

at that time, in the case of The Attorney General v. Herath (1960) 62 NLR

145 decided that paraveni nilakarayas are the owners of the land.

The other is, the services due in respect of nindagama lands were

abolished and all nilakarayas were declared as owners by the Nindagama

Lands Act No. 30 of 1968.

These developments took place after the enactment of the Partition Act

No. 16 of 1951 but before the enactment of the Partition Law No. 21 of

1977. I doubt whether this would have led the drafter of the Partition Law

No. 21 of 1977 to choose not to include a provision similar to section 54

of the Partition Act No. 16 of 1951.

This omission can also be deliberate on the part of the legislature.

It is noteworthy that despite this omission, paraveni nilakarayas

continued to file partition actions in the District Courts without any

objection from the ninda lords. The District Courts entertained

these cases without hesitation until the learned District Judge in

the present case held that, following the enactment of Partition Law

No. 21 of 1977, no partition action can be filed for land subject to

rajakariya. This is stated by none other than the ninda lord in the

instant action (Basnayake Nilame of Sabaragamu Maha Saman

Devalaya) in his written submissions tendered to the District Court

23

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

dated 29.06.2004 and 02.09.2004 who says a paraveni pangu can be

partitioned subject to rajakariya.

However, as I pointed out earlier, in the interpretation section of the

Nindagama Lands Act, there was a reference excluding viharagam and

devalagam from the operation of the Act. Therefore, whether paraveni

nilakarayas in viharagam and devalagam can institute a partition action

remains unresolved.

With this in view, a Bill was presented to Parliament in this year (which

was gazetted on 23.02.2023) to amend the Partition Law introducing

provisions similar to section 54 of the Partition Act No. 16 of 1951

expressly stating that paraveni nilakaraya can file a partition action to

partition a paraveni pangu in a temple land according to the Partition

Law. Following are the proposed amendments to the principal statute.

2A(1) Every praveni nilakaraya or any person who derives title from

a praveni nilakaraya in a praveni pangu of a temple land shall be

entitled to institute a partition action for the partition or sale of such

praveni pangu in accordance with the provisions of this Law.

(2) Where there are more than one praveni nilakarayas or persons

having an interest in a praveni pangu, such praveni nilakarayas or

such persons may be made parties to any action instituted under

subsection (1).

(3)(a) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby stated that the partition

or sale of a praveni pangu shall not affect any rights of a temple

enforceable under the provisions of the Service Tenures Ordinance

(Chapter 467) and the temple shall be entitled to exercise rights

under such Ordinance through its trustee or Viharadhipathi as the

case may be, as though no partition or sale had occurred in respect

24

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

of the entirety of the praveni pangu or any portion thereof as the case

may be.

(b) Any right of a temple enforceable under the Service Tenures

Ordinance (Chapter 467) shall remain unaffected irrespective of the

fact that a trustee or a Viharadhipathi of such temple has been or

has not been made a party to a partition action instituted under the

provisions of this section.

(4)(a) A trustee appointed with reference to a temple referred to in

subsection (1) under the provisions of the Buddhist Temporalities

Ordinance (Chapter 318) or a Viharadipathi of a temple which is

exempted under the provisions of section 4(1) of the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance (Chapter 318), as the case may be, may

make an application to be a party to the partition action instituted

under subsection (1).

(b) Where such trustee or Viharadhipathi, as the case may be, makes

an application under paragraph (a) of this subsection, the court shall

make such trustee or Viharadhipathi a party to such action.

48(1) Substitution for the words a lease at will or for a period not

exceeding one month of the words a lease at will or for a period

not exceeding one month or the rights of a temple enforceable under

the Service Tenures Ordinance (Chapter 467).

83. By the insertion of the following new definitions:

praveni nilakaraya shall have the same meaning assigned to it

under section 2 of the Service Tenures Ordinance (Chapter 467) to

the extent it relates to a temple;

praveni pangu shall include any land or a part of any land held by

one or more persons subject to the performance of any service or

25

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

rendering of any duties to the temple as defined in section 2 of the

Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance (Chapter 318) in respect of which

an order for commuted dues in lieu of services under section 15 of

the Service Tenures Ordinance (Chapter 467) has been made and

shall include the same meaning assigned to it in section 2 of the

Service Tenures Ordinance (Chapter 467) to the extent it relates to a

temple;

temple shall have the same meaning assigned to it in section 2 of

the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance (Chapter 318) in so far as

such temple is possessed of rights as specified under the Service

Tenures Ordinance (Chapter 467);

Trustee shall have the same meaning assigned to it in section 2 of

the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance (Chapter 318).

The order of the District Court affirmed by the Court of Appeal

The District Court decided to dismiss the partition action on four

grounds:

(a) Lack of absolute ownership to the land to be partitioned by the

plaintiffs;

(b) The indivisibility of service to be performed to the ninda lord;

(c) Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 does not provide for partition of lands

subject to rajakariya;

(d) Land subject to rajakariya cannot be partitioned even with the

consent of the ninda lord.

Who can institute a partition action?

The question as to who can institute a partition action relates to (a), (c)

and (d) above. The short answer to the question of who can institute a

26

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

partition action is that any co-owner to the land can institute a partition

action.

Section 10 of the Ordinance No. 21 of 1844 enacted that when any

landed property shall belong in common to two or more owners, it is and

shall be competent to any one or more such owners to compel a partition of

the said property. Section 15 provided for any such owner to seek sale

of the land instead of partition when on account of the number or poverty

of the parties, the nature or value of the property, or from other causes, a

partition would be injurious or impossible.

Section 2 of both the Partition Ordinance No. 10 of 1863 and the Partition

Act No. 16 of 1951 contained similar provisions, addressing both

partition and sale within the same section.

Section 2 of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 enacts the same:

2. Where any land belongs in common to two or more owners, any

one or more of them, whether or not his or their ownership is subject

to any life interest in any other person, may institute an action for

the partition or sale of the land in accordance with the provisions of

this Law.

The term owner was not defined in the previous Partition Ordinances

or the Partition Act. Nor is it defined in the present Partition Law. In the

absence of a specific definition of the term owner in the Act, it should

be construed to refer to a person possessing the attributes of ownership

as recognised by the general law at the time of the enactment of the

Partition Law. Any modification to this interpretation should be made in

consideration of the context in which the term is used. This was what

was stated by the Privy Council in The Attorney General v. Herath at page

147 when it was called upon to define the term owner in the context of

a different statute.

27

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

What are the rights sufficient to constitute a person an owner under

our law? The short answer is, the right to possession, the right to recover

possession, and the right to disposition. I need only to quote pages 147-

148 of the same Privy Council decision for a complete answer:

Lee (Introduction to Roman Dutch Law 5th edition p. 121) in a chapter

headed The Meaning of ownership reflecting the views of Van der

Linden says:-

Dominion or Ownership is the relation protected by law in which a

man stands to a thing, which he may: (a) possess, (b) use and enjoy,

(c) alienate. The right to possess implies the right to vindicate, that

is, to recover possession from a person who possesses without title

to possess derived from the owner.

Grotius in Book 2 chapter 3 of his Introduction to the Jurisprudence

of Holland says:-

Ownership is the property in a thing whereby a person who has not

the possession may acquire the same by legal process.

Commenting on this Lee says (p. 121) Grotius selects this right as

the most signal quality of ownership.

Maasdorp (Volume 2 p. 27) says the rights of an owner are

comprised under three heads, namely, (1) the right of possession

and the right to recover possession; (2) the right of use and

enjoyment; and (3) the right of disposition. He goes on to say these

three factors are all essential to the idea of ownership but need not

all be present in an equal degree at one and the same time.

The next question is whether a modification of the general meaning of the

term owner is required in the context of the Partition Law.

28

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

Full ownership

Should the plaintiff have full ownership or full dominium or absolute

ownership in the property to institute a partition action?

As previously quoted, in the early case of Jotihamy v. Dingirihamy, Wendt

J. thought that full dominium was necessary and that in service tenure

lands it vested in the ninda lord and not in paraveni nilakarayas.

Paraveni nilakarayas were recognised as tenants. This judgment was

followed by Hutchinson C.J. in Kaluwa v. Rankira (1907) 3

Balasinghams Reports 264.

However, in the discussion of parties entitled to institute partition

actions, K.D.P. Wickremesinghe in The Law of Partition in Ceylon (1969)

at page 46 under the subheading Trustee and Beneficiary states:

To be entitled to institute a partition action it is not necessary that

the co-owner should have absolute ownership in the property.

Citing several judgments in support, the learned author states at page

48:

[T]he principle in all these cases is that a co-owner who institutes a

partition action should have the legal estate of the property vested

in him so that he can rightly be considered the owner. He need not

be one who is entitled to the absolute dominium or who is

beneficially interested.

In Daniel v. Saranelis Appu (1903) 7 NLR 163 the plaintiff who was a

trustee of a temple filed a partition action claiming an undivided two-

fifths share of the land. It was argued for the respondent that a trustee

is not an owner such as is contemplated by the Partition Ordinance No.

10 of 1863. Rejecting this argument, Layard C.J. with the agreement of

Wendt J. held at 165-166:

29

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

It appears to me that Ordinance No. 10 of 1863 was not intended to

be limited to persons who have an absolute ownership in the

property, but that it also includes one who has an undivided share

vested in him as trustee. The English Courts have allowed a partition

suit to be brought by freehold tenants in possession, whether they

are entitled in fee simple, or in fee tail or for life, and there have been

cases in which they have allowed a partition action where an estate

was vested in a person for a term of years only. The trustee under

the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance appears to me to be the owner

of the temple property subject to the terms of the trust on which the

property is vested in him, and I see no reason why he should not be

allowed to bring an action for partition under Ordinance No. 10 of

1863. No authority has been cited to us in which it has been held

that such a trustee cannot bring a partition suit under that

Ordinance. This Court has recognized the rights of executors and

administrators as parties to a partition suit under Ordinance No. 10

of 1863, and having allowed trustees to be parties in such suits I

see no reason why a trustee created by statute should be excluded

from the right of bringing a partition suit, unless there is anything in

the statute which limits the power of the trustee and prohibits him

from bringing such an action.

In Babey Nona v. Silva (1906) 9 NLR 251 it was argued on behalf of the

appellant that the Partition Ordinance was inapplicable to lands which

are subject to fidei commissum because fiduciaries do not have absolute

ownership in the property. This was rejected by Lascelles A.C.J. with the

agreement of Middleton J. at pages 255-256 in the following terms:

It is true that the language of the Partition Ordinance appears at first

sight to limit the scope of the Ordinance to land which is held in

common by two or more persons as absolute owners. Section 2, for

30

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

example, deals with the case of landed property belonging in

common to two or more owners, and authorizes one or more of such

owners to compel partition.

This difficulty is largely reduced, if it is not altogether removed, when

it is remembered that by the Roman-Dutch Law the fiduciarius was

a true owner; he had a real though a burdened right of ownership.

It is also material that in David v. Sarnelis Appu 7 N.L.R. 163 this

Court held that a trustee under the Buddhist Temporalities

Ordinance was an owner for the purposes of the Partition Ordinance.

In my opinion the balance of reason and authority is in favour of the

view that property subject to fidei commissum may be the subject of

partition, and I hold, in the case under consideration, that the

property in dispute, though subject to fidei commissum, was lawfully

partitioned.

But the partition decree in no way extinguishes the reversionary

interest of the fidei commissarius. It merely sets apart a specific

portion of the common estate to which the rights of the fidei

commissarius attach in severalty.

By no reasonable construction of the Ordinance can it be held that

the effect of a partition decree is to enlarge the life interest of the

fiduciarius into absolute ownership. In the words of Lord Watson in

Tillekeratne v. Abeysekere (2 N.L.R. 313): the partitionwould

not necessarily destroy a fidei commissum attaching to one or more

of the shares before partition.

As mentioned previously, two of the essential attributes of ownership are

the right to possession and the right to recover possession. However, in

cases where a property is held by one person subject to the life interest

of another, the former cannot be technically regarded as an owner

31

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

because he is unable to exercise the right to possession. He has only the

bare dominium of the property. It may be on that basis in cases such as

Charles Appu v. Dias Abeysinghe (1933) 35 NLR 323 the Court held that

a person who is entitled to the dominium only of an undivided share of

land, the usufruct being vested in another, is not entitled to bring a

partition action. Nevertheless, section 2 of the present Partition Law No.

21 of 1977 allows a co-owner, whose rights in the land are subject to the

life interest held by another, to institute a partition action.

For the aforesaid reasons, I take the view that the plaintiff does not

necessarily require absolute ownership of the land to institute a partition

action.

Can paraveni nilakaraya be regarded as an owner for the purpose of

partition law?

In the early cases of Marikar v. Assanpillai (1916) 4 Court of Appeal Cases

85 and Kiriduraya v. Kudaduraya (1916) 3 Ceylon Weekly Reporter 188,

De Sampayo J. expressed the opinion that paraveni nilakarayas are the

owners of their holdings subject only to the performance of service to

their ninda lords.

In Marikar v. Assanpillai at page 86-87 it was held:

The case for the plaintiff was put as high as this, that he was the

owner of the tenants holding and had in substance leased them to

the tenants for a consideration which must be paid in some shape

or another. This involves an entire misconception of the relation

between the nindagama proprietor and the nilakarayas. The holding

in fact belongs to the tenants themselves subject only to the

performance of service, and they become free even of this burden if

the right to service is lost, as, for instance, by non-performance of

service for 10 years. The nature of the service is definite and

32

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

determined, and the tenant is bound to do that [service] and none

other. If he has elected to commute the service by a money payment,

the proprietor can of course claim the money irrespective of any

change in the circumstances. But if there has been no such election

the proprietor must be content with exacting the service, and if that

becomes impossible, he must suffer the loss.

In Kiriduraya v. Kudaduraya at page 189-190 it was stated:

The word paraveni does not mean inalienable, it only implies

permanency and descent to heirs. The paraveni tenant holds the

land in fee simple subject only to the performance of service, and his

title is liable to be affected by the ordinary incidents of adverse

possession by a third party. The fact that the party who so

possesses adversely is the overlord himself makes no difference.

However, in later decisions such as Jotihamy v. Dingirihamy and Kaluwa

v. Rankira the contrary view was taken.

In the Full Bench decision in Appuhamy v. Menike (1917) 19 NLR 361,

De Sampayo J. disagrees with the view expressed by Wendt J. in

Jotihamys case that a paraveni nilakaraya is not an owner but merely a

tenant of paraveni pangu when he states at page 366:

I may say, with great respect to Wendt J., who delivered the

judgment, that I am not convinced that his conclusion as to the

nature of the title of a paraveni nilakaraya was right. He did not

profess to discuss the origin of this species of feudal tenure, nor refer

to any authorities. All that is said in the judgment is that the

dominium in service tenure land is generally regarded as vested in

the person usually described as proprietor of the nindagama or the

overlord, while the nilakarayas are similarly spoken of as tenants.

There are no grounds stated for the opinion that the dominium is

33

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

generally regarded as vested in the overlord. That is the very

problem requiring solution.

Ennis J. in Appuhamy v. Menike states at pages 361-362:

It is clear that the relations of the ninda proprietor and the

nilakaraya as of a paraveni panguwa are not the ordinary relations

of a landlord and tenant. A nilakaraya of a paraveni panguwa holds

the land in perpetuity subject to the service (Ordinance No. 4 of 1870,

section 3); and since 1870 the ninda proprietor has no right to eject

a paraveni nilakaraya for non-performance of the service, he can

recover only the value of the services in an action for damages

(Ordinance No. 4 of 1870, section 25). It is to be observed that a

panguwa is only a portion (allotment or share) of the holding of a

ninda lord as the proprietor of the whole nindagama of which any

part is held by a nilakaraya. A paraveni nilakaraya is defined as

a holder of a paraveni panguwa, while the term tenant is used

to describe a maruvena nilakaraya, who is a tenant at will, as

distinct from a paraveni nilakaraya, a holder in perpetuity.

This question of whether a paraveni nilakaraya can be regarded as the

owner of paraveni pangu was extensively dealt with in the aforementioned

Privy Council decision in The Attorney General v. Herath, which was an

appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Herath v. The Attorney

General where the principal judgment was delivered by Chief Justice

Basnayake.

First, the Privy Council unhesitatingly agrees with the majority view of

the Full Bench decision in Appuhamy v. Menike that a paraveni

nilakaraya is the owner of paraveni pangu and states at pages 150-151:

The case of Appuhamy v. Menike needs further comment. The

question which arose in that case was whether a paraveni

34

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

nilakaraya could bring an action under the Partition Ordinance 10 of

1863 to partition a holding which he held with others. Two points

had to be decided. The first whether a paraveni nilakaraya was an

owner, the second was whether the nature of the services to be

rendered made the ordinance inapplicable. There had previously

been a conflict of authority and the case on appeal was referred for

an authoritative decision to a bench of three judges of the Supreme

Court, Ennis, J., de Sampayo, J. and Shaw, J. (normally two judges

would have decided the appeal). On the question of ownership

Ennis, J. came to the conclusion set out above [i.e. In my opinion a

paraveni nilakaraya holds all the rights which, under Maasdorps

definition, constitute ownership but he nevertheless does not

possess full ownership in that the ninda lord holds a perpetual right

to service, the obligation to perform which attaches to the land]. De

Sampayo, J. said I am of opinion that paraveni nilakarayas are the

owners of the land. Shaw, J. dissented. It will be seen that the

majority of the court were of opinion that a paraveni nilakaraya is

an owner. With this view their Lordships are in entire agreement.

Thereafter, the Privy Council at pages 148-150 provides its own

explanation as to why a paraveni nilakaraya is entitled to be regarded as

an owner in the following manner:

The next question is whether a paraveni nilakaraya can properly be

regarded as an owner. It is common ground that a nilakaraya

holds an allotment of land (known as a pangu) subject to the

performance of services for, or payment of dues to (where the

performance of services had been commuted for the payment of

dues) an overlord (referred to very appropriately by the learned

Chief Justice in his judgment and hereafter by their Lordships as the

ninda lord). Sometimes (as in the present case) a temple was the

35

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

ninda lord. It is also common ground that the type of nilakaraya

known as a maruwena nilakaraya holds the land as a tenant at

will and the type known as a paraveni nilakaraya (second

respondent belonged to this type) holds the land in perpetuity. It

was, as stated by the learned Chief Justice, a hereditary holding.

The learned Chief Justice makes a forceful point in support of the

view that a paraveni nilakaraya must be regarded as a tenant and

not as an owner when he points out that in certain legislation

language is used which seems to imply that a paraveni nilakaraya

must be regarded as a tenant and not as an owner. For instance, in

Section 27 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance (Volume V

Ceylon Legislative Enactments p. 655) the words a paraveni pangu

tenants interest are used. The Service Tenures Ordinance 4 of 1870

(Volume VI Ceylon Legislative Enactments p. 657) uses the words

nindagama proprietor to designate a ninda lord:-

nindagama proprietor shall mean any proprietor of nindagama

entitled to demand services from any paraveni nilakaraya or

maruwena nilakaraya, for and in respect of a praveni pangu or

maruwena pangu held by him;.

This language normally, in the absence of other relevant material,

would afford strong reason for the conclusion that a paraveni

nilakaraya does not occupy the status of an owner. But ultimately

the question whether a person is an owner or not must be

determined by the rights and attributes he possesses in law. If those

attributes clearly establish his position as owner the considerations

which arise from the language referred to above must give way.

The rights of a paraveni nilakaraya in respect of his holding became

enlarged in the course of time as stated by the learned Chief Justice

and this fact with its accompanying uncertainty as to what those

36

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

rights were at any particular time probably led to some confusion

particularly in the language by which they were sometimes

described.

Following on a report by a commission called the Service Tenures

Commission an ordinance, The Service Tenures Ordinance 4 of 1870

was passed. It was, as stated by de Sampayo, J. in the case of

Appuhamy v. Menike (1917) 19 N.L.R. 361 at p. 367, on most points

declaratory. Whatever the position was before the ordinance was

passed, after its passage its provisions must be accepted to the

exclusion of all contending views that may previously have existed.

And, though historical research into those contending views may be

interesting, it cannot modify the clear provisions of the ordinance. In

Section 2 a paraveni nilakaraya is said to be the holder of a praveni

pangu in perpetuity, subject to the performance of certain services to

the temple or nindagama proprietor; a paraveni pangu is said to

be an allotment or share of land in a temple or nindagama village

held in perpetuity by one or more holders, subject to the performance

of certain services to the temple or nindagama proprietor. Section

24 is to the following effect:-

24. Arrears of personal services in cases where the praveni

nilakaraya shall not have commuted shall not be recoverable for any

period beyond a year; arrears of commuted dues, where the praveni

niIakaraya shall have commuted, shall not be recoverable for any

period beyond two years. If no services shall have been rendered,

and no commuted dues be paid for ten years, and no action shall

have been brought therefor, the right to claim services or commuted

dues shall be deemed to have been lost for ever and the pangu shall

be deemed free thereafter from any liability on the part of the

nilakarayas to render services or pay commuted dues therefor:.

37

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

A proviso to the section has no bearing on this case.

It is common ground that the services to be rendered were personal.

Section 25 is to the following effect:-

25. It shall be lawful for any proprietor to recover damages in any

competent court against the holder or holders of any praveni pangu

who shall not have commuted, and who shall have failed to render

the services defined in the registry hereinbefore referred to. In

assessing such damages, it shall be competent for the court to award

not only the sum for which the services shall have been assessed by

the Commissioners for the purpose of perpetual commutation, but

such further sum as it shall consider fair and reasonable to cover the

actual damages sustained by the proprietor through the default of

the nilakaraya or nilakarayas to render such personal services at

the time when they were due; but it shall not be lawful for any

proprietor to proceed to ejectment against his praveni nilakaraya for

default of performing services or paying commuted dues; the value

of those services or dues shall be recoverable against such

nilakaraya by seizure and sale of the crop or fruits on the pangu, or

failing these, by the personal property of such nilakaraya, or failing

both, by a sale of the pangu, subject to the personal services, or

commuted dues in lieu thereof, due thereon to the proprietor. The

proceeds of such sale are to be applied in payment of the amount

due to the proprietor, and the balance, if any, shall be paid to the

evicted nilakarayas, unless there should be any puisne

encumbrance upon the holding, in which case such balance shall be

applied to satisfy such encumbrance.

This is what the ordinance declared the law to be and was the law

after the ordinance came into force.

38

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

It will be seen that a paraveni nilakaraya cannot be ejected for non-

performance of service or non-payment of dues. This means that he

is subject to no liability similar to that of forfeiture. Moreover he is

accorded a right of possession in respect of his holding

superior to the general rights of an owner. The latter in respect

of a judgment debt is liable to have any part of his property

proceeded against in execution. But a paraveni nilakarayas holding

may be proceeded against on a judgment for damages for non-

performance of services or for non-payment of dues only after certain

property belonging to him has been exhausted. It was not disputed

that he had the right to the use and enjoyment of the land,

the right to dispose of it, and the right to sue for and recover

possession if he was disturbed. He has therefore all the rights

which entitle him to be regarded as an owner.

The Privy Council then explains why the ninda lord cannot be regarded

as an owner at page 151 in the following terms:

As already stated a paraveni nilakaraya possesses all the essential

attributes which a person must possess before he can be regarded

as an owner. As for the ninda lord he has not the right of

possession. He cannot even enter into possession for non-

fulfillment of services or non-payment of dues. Further the

right to possession of the paraveni nilakaraya has the special

protection of the law already indicated. The ninda lord

cannot sell or otherwise dispose of the holding of the

paraveni nilakaraya. He has no right of use and enjoyment.

He has a bare right to services. Their Lordships do not think

he can possibly be regarded as the owner.

In the Full Bench decision of Appuhamy v. Menike, De Sampayo J. states

at pages 368:

39

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

The state of the law to be gathered from the above references is

made clearer by the Service Tenures Ordinance, No. 4 of 1870. It is

remarkable that nowhere in the Ordinance is the lord of a

nindagama referred to directly or indirectly as the owner of the lands

held by the paraveni nilakarayas. On the other hand, section 24

declares that if services are not rendered or commuted dues paid by

the paraveni nilakarayas for a period of ten years, the panguwa

shall be deemed free thereafter from any liability on the part of the

nilakarayas to render services or pay commuted dues. It seems to

me clear that in such a case the Ordinance intends that what was

previously qualified ownership shall become absolute ownership.

Section 25 lays down the order in which the property of the

nilakaraya may be sold in execution for default of payment of

damages for non-performance of services, and provides that the

value of services shall be recovered in the last resort by a sale of

the pangu. Here the pangu does not mean the possessory interest,

because the same section enacts that the tenant shall not be ejected

for non-performance of service. The pangu is defined in the

Ordinance itself as the allotment or share of land; there is, to my

mind, no meaning in providing for the sale of the pangu, unless the

tenant is the owner of the allotment.

I hold that a paraveni nilakaraya is the owner of paraveni panguwa and

therefore falls within the meaning of the term owner imposed upon it

by the context of the Partition Law. The Partition Law does not restrict

institution of partition actions by persons who have full ownership in the

land to be partitioned.

Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance and Paraveni Nilakaraya

Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance No. 19 of 1931 contains several

references to paraveni nilakaraya in its text although there are no express

40

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

provisions on the partition of a paraveni panguwa. Nonetheless, those

references are helpful to understand the status of a paraveni nilakaraya

in respect of a paraveni panguwa belonging to a temple within the

meaning of the Ordinance. A closer look at the provisions referring to

paraveni nilakaraya in the Ordinance shows that throughout the

Ordinance, he has been treated as a tenant rather than an owner. For

instance, the very definition of a paraveni panguwa under section 2 is as

follows:

paraveni panguwa means an allotment of land held by one or more

hereditary tenants subject to the performance of service or rendering

of dues to a temple.

It can be implied from the terminology used in the said definition that

while the paraveni nilakaraya is a tenant, his interest in the land is

hereditary. The term paraveni nilakaraya has not been defined in the

Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance. This definition to the term paraveni

panguwa found in the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance is different

from the definition given to paraveni panguwa in the Service Tenures

Ordinance which is the principal statute governing the matters in relation

to service tenures. According to section 2 of the Service Tenures

Ordinance, paraveni panguwa means an allotment or share of land in

a temple held in perpetuity by one or more holders subject to the

performance of certain services to the temple. Temple includes vihara and

dewala. In the Service Tenures Ordinance, the paraveni nilakaraya has

been defined as the holder of a paraveni pangu in perpetuity (not as the

tenant of the paraveni pangu) subject to the performance of services to

the temple. The maruwena nilakaraya has been defined as the tenant at

will in respect of the maruwena pangu. There is a conflict between the

two parallel statutes on this point.

41

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

The idea that a paraveni nilakaraya is a tenant is in contradistinction

with some of the provisions of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance

itself.

When section 26 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance is read with

section 27, it can be inferred that while the immovable property of a

temple cannot be alienated, that does not apply to a paraveni panguwa.

However, under section 27, when a paraveni pangu tenants interest in

any land held of a temple is transferred, it shall be the duty of the

transferee within one month of such transfer to send a written notice

thereof in duplicate to the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs. Thereafter,

the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs shall send one copy of every such

notice to the trustee of the temple concerned. It necessarily follows that,

a paraveni nilakaraya can transfer his interest without the permission of

the temple which is not in line with his status as a tenant.

Furthermore, under section 28 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance,

whenever the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs is satisfied that any

immovable property belonging to any temple has been before the

commencement of the Ordinance mortgaged, sold, or otherwise alienated

to the detriment of such temple, it is the duty of the Commissioner of

Buddhist Affairs to direct the trustee, or the controlling viharadhipati, to

institute legal proceedings to set aside such mortgage, sale, or alienation,

and to recover possession of such property. But this provision does not

apply to a paraveni panguwa with the implication that it does not fall

within the ownership of the temple like any other immovable property.

Appuhamy v. Menike and Attorney General v. Herath held that a paraveni

nilakaraya is an owner of the paraveni panguwa subject to the

performance of service to the temple. In The Attorney General v. Herath,

the Privy Council, referring to the term paraveni pangu tenants interest

42

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

found in section 27 of Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance states at page

148:

This language normally, in the absence of other relevant material,

would afford strong reason for the conclusion that a paraveni

nilakaraya does not occupy the status of an owner. But ultimately

the question whether a person is an owner or not must be

determined by the rights and attributes he possesses in law. If those

attributes clearly establish his position as owner, the considerations

which arise from the language referred to above must give way.

Similarly, in Appuhamy v. Menike, De Sampayo J. while ruling that a

paraveni nilakaraya is an owner states at page 366:

The terms overlord and tenant are natural to any system of

tenure, such as the fee simple tenure in the English system of real

property, but they do not necessarily describe the nature of the

rights.

Therefore, despite the references of Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance to

a paraveni nilakaraya as a tenant, it is settled law that he is the owner of

the paraveni panguwa subject to the performance of service to the temple.

Acquisition of full ownership

Under section 24 of the Service Tenures Ordinance quoted above, the

ninda lord loses his rights to the services or commuted dues, if they have

not been rendered or paid for ten years and no action has been brought

for them within those ten years. This results in the paraveni nilakaraya

acquiring full ownership to the land.

There are several nilakarayas in a panguwa and such panguwa can

comprise several allotments. According to the ruling in Asmadale v.

Weerasuria [1905] 3 Balasinghams Reports 51, for the application of

43

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

section 24 of the Service Tenures Ordinance, it must be demonstrated

that neither services have been performed nor dues paid by any one of

the nilakarayas in respect of all the allotments included in the panguwa,

and not solely in relation to the allotment that is the subject matter of

the action. This ruling can be revisited in an appropriate future case.

If this is established, it was held in Bandara v. Dingiri Menika (1943) 44

NLR 393 that the paraveni nilakaraya acquires full ownership.

In this regard, the initial burden that no services were performed and/or

no payments were made in respect of the allotment or allotments in suit

lies with the paraveni nilakaraya. Once that burden is discharged, the

burden shifts to the ninda lord to prove that services were rendered

and/or payments were made in respect of other allotments of paraveni

panguwa by some other nilakarayas.

In Bandara v. Dingiri Menika, Howard C.J. with the agreement of

Keuneman J. stated at 395-396:

[D]ue regard must be paid to the decision in Asmadale v.

Weerasuriya (supra), which was followed in Martin v. Hatana [16

NLR 92], that the obligation of the tenants of a panguwa of a

nindagama to render services is in the nature of an indivisible

obligation, and therefore the liability to pay commuted dues is also

indivisible. The whole amount may be recovered from one tenant.

The payment, therefore of the dues by one tenant in respect of the

whole panguwa prevents forfeiture of the ninda proprietors rights

against the other tenants under section 24 of the Service Tenures

Ordinance, and it is also a bar to the other tenants gaining

prescriptive rights under section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. So

far as the evidence in this case goes, I agree with the learned Judge

that the plaintiffs have established that neither services were

44

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

performed nor dues paid in respect of the land, the subject of this

action for a period of ten years. No evidence has been tendered by

the appellants that such services were performed or dues paid in

respect of other lands of the panguwa. In view of the fact that the

plaintiffs had proved that no services were performed nor dues paid

in respect of the land sought to be partitioned, I am of opinion that

the burden of proof rested on the defendants to show that such

performances were made or dues paid in respect of other lands of

the panguwa.

The dicta of Howard C.J. at page 396 The only clog on the full ownership

of the nilakaraya is the obligation to perform services. Relief from such

obligation would therefore confer full ownership was approved by the

Privy Council in The Attorney General v. Herath at page 151.

Howard C.J. ultimately held at page 397 Inasmuch as the land is no

longer subject to a liability to perform indivisible services I am of opinion

that the learned Judge was right in coming to the conclusion that it could

be the subject of a partition action under the Ordinance.

However, as I have already stated, full ownership in a paraveni pangu is

not necessary for a paraveni nilakaraya to institute a partition action.

Partition with the consent of the ninda lord

In the instant case, the ninda load, consented to partition the land but

the learned District Judge stated that even with the consent of the ninda

lord, partition is not possible.

In Dias v. Carlinahamy (1919) 21 NLR 112, Scheider A.J. held at page

114 lands subject to service tenures cannot be sold or partitioned under

the provisions of the Partition Ordinance, unless it may be in cases where

45

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

the proprietor of the nindagama and the paraveni nilakaraya are all

consenting parties to the proceedings.

However, in Kasturiaracci v. Pini (1958) 61 NLR 167 it was held The

partition under the repealed Partition Ordinance of a paraveni panguwa is

not valid even where the ninda proprietor is a consenting party to the

proceedings. Basnayake C.J. at page 168 took the view that where a

Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action parties cannot by consent

confer jurisdiction on it. The learned District Judge is therefore right in

holding that the partition decree is a nullity.

Parties cannot confer jurisdiction where there is none. In other words,

when there is patent or total lack of jurisdiction (as opposed to latent lack

of jurisdiction), parties cannot confer jurisdiction. The District Court has

jurisdiction to hear partition cases and the question here is whether the

jurisdiction has been invoked in the right way. It is not a question of

patent or total lack of jurisdiction. In my view, in any event, a paraveni

nilakaraya can file a partition action with the consent of the ninda lord.

Indivisibility of service

The Full Bench in Appuhamy v. Menike had to address two issues:

whether paraveni nilakarayas are considered owners and whether the

nature of services to be rendered made the Partition Ordinance

inapplicable to pangu land.

In The Attorney General v. Herath, the Privy Council states at page 151

that the Full Bench in Appuhamy v. Menike decided that paraveni

nilakarayas are disqualified from instituting a partition action because

the services that have to be performed by nilakarayas in a pangu land

are incapable of division. But the Privy Council did not express its opinion

on that issue, although it expressed its opinion in favour of paraveni

46

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

nilakaraya on the other issue, namely whether paraveni nilakaraya is

considered an owner.

In the early case (C.R. Ratnapura, No. 284) decided on 31.05.1877 and

reported in (1877) Ramanathans Reports 131, the Basnayake Nilame of

Maha Saman Devalaya of Sabaragamuwa sued 12 defendants to recover

Rs. 18.50 as commuted dues for failure as tenants of a pangu belonging

to the said devalaya to render certain services. The Supreme Court held

that each of the nilakarayas of a panguwa was liable only for the share

of the service which is proportionate to his share in the panguwa.

The Commissioner has decided, as this Court thinks erroneously,

that each is liable for the whole. We are not aware of any law or

custom by which one of such nilakarayas of a panguwa is liable to

render services for the whole panguwa, that is to say, for himself as

well as his co-tenants. The mere fact of the Commissioner having

valued the services of the whole panguwa, instead of valuing the

services of each nilakaraya, cannot create a liability which did not

exist before.

In Ratwatte v. Polambegoda (1901) 5 NLR 143, the question whether

liability of the nilakarayas was or was not joint and several was in issue.

The trial Court held that it was joint and several. On appeal, although

this matter was not specifically dealt with, it is clear from the judgment

of Lawrie A.C.J. that His Lordship concurred in that proposition of law

laid down by the trial Court. This was so stated by Lascelles C.J. in Martin

v. Hatana (1913) 16 NLR 92 at 93.

In Herath v. Attorney General Basnayake C.J. at page 205 states In the

scheme of land tenure the panguwa though consisting of extensive lands

is indivisible and the nilakarayas are jointly and severally liable to render

services or pay dues.

47

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

In Asmadale v. Weerasuria it was held that the liability of nilakarayas is

a joint liability. Pereira A.P.J. states at pages 52-53 that the whole service

may be rendered or the whole commuted amount may be recovered from

one nilakaraya and such nilakaraya is entitled to contribution from other

nilakarayas of the panguwa.

The liability of the tenants of a panguwa is a joint liability. At the

same time the services in their nature were indivisible, and,

therefore, the obligation to pay the commuted dues must be regarded

as an indivisible obligation. Whether the service was to cultivate the

muttettu field, or to accompany the ninda proprietor on a journey, or

carry his talipot or watch his field or keep watch at his house, it was

indivisible. Each tenant could not claim to be liable to cultivate a

portion only of the field, or to accompany the chief on only a part of

the journey, or to keep watch at a part only of his house, etc. The

nature of the service was such that the liability to perform it was

indivisible, and, therefore, as observed already, the liability to the

commuted dues must also be regarded as an indivisible liability.

This indivisible obligation must I take it, be given the same effect as

it would have under our Common Law. The consequence to the

debtors, where there are more than one, of an indivisible obligation,

is practically the same as that of an obligation contracted in solido

(see Pothier 2.4.31). Each obligator is obliged for the whole of the

thing or act that forms the subject of the obligation. On his giving or

performing such thing or act he is entitled to contribution from his co-

obligors. The payment of the whole amount of the dues in the present

case by one or more of the Nilakarayas, was a payment properly

made in respect of the whole panguwa, and it cannot be said that

there has been a forfeiture of the ninda proprietors rights in respect

of any part or portion of the panguwa under section 24 of the Service

Tenures Ordinance; and for the same reason I think that the 3rd

48

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

defendant cannot claim any prescriptive right under section 3 of

Ordinance No. 22 of 1871.

The dicta of Pereira A.P.J. in Asmadale v. Weerasuria that the services

in their nature were indivisible, and, therefore, the obligation to pay the

commuted dues must be regarded as an indivisible obligation was not

considered to be correct by Soertsz J. in Jayaratne v. Gunaratna Thero

(1944) 45 NLR 97 at 99 when His Lordship stated If I may say so with

respect this view, that the obligation to pay the commuted dues is an

indivisible obligation, appears to me to be the correct view in the light of

the provision of the Service Tenures Ordinance itself, and not for the reason

given by Pereira J. that the services being indivisible, it necessarily

followed that the alternative or secondary obligation was indivisible.

According to Soertsz J. at pages 99-100

Service Tenures Ordinance makes it sufficiently clear that the

services as well as the dues attached to the panguwa and are

indivisible and owed jointly and severally by the nilakarayas and

are exigible from any of them subject to his or their right to claim

contribution. Sections 9 and 10 of the Ordinance provide for the

ascertainment and registration of the nature and extent of the

services in relation to each pangu. Sections 14 and 15 make it clearer

still that the unit is the pangu and not the Nilakaraya for section 14

requires the application for commutation in the case of a pangu with

several or many Nilakarayas to be made or acquiesced in by a

majority of those above sixteen years of age, and section 15 requires

the Commissioner to ascertain as far as practicable whether all the

Nilakarayas above 16 years of age desire the commutation. Both

these requirements would surely be out of place, if it were intended

to leave it open to one or more of the Nilakarayas to commute his or

their services for a pro rata payment of dues. Section 15 goes on to

49

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

say that once commutation has been determined and fixed the

Nilakarayas shall be liable to pay the proprietorsthe annual

amount of money payment due for and in respect ofthe services;

and such commuted dues shall thenceforth be decided to be a head

rent due for and in respect of the pangu. That, as I understand it,

makes the pangu the head or the unit. This view is supported by

the terms of section 25 which provides the remedy of a proprietor

when there is default of payment of the commuted dues. It enacts

that if the dues be not paid, they shall be recovered by seizure and

sale of the crop or fruits on the pangu or failing these by the personal

property of the Nilakaraya or failing both by a sale of the pangu.

The crop and fruits on the whole pangu, and ultimately the whole

pangu itself being made liable it follows the proprietors may seize

and sell any part of the crop and fruits or any part of the pangu.

The opinion expressed by Wendt J. in the old case of Jotihamy v.

Dingirihamy decided in 1906 was not a considered opinion on that

matter. If I may repeat, this is all what Wendt J. stated at page 68:

Another objection is based upon the indivisibility of the services.

Counsel on both sides were allowed the opportunity of looking into

the authorities on this point but have not been able to produce

anything which recognises the right of a tenant to maintain a

partition action. We are therefore invited to decide the appeal upon

general principles. Applying these to the best of our ability we think

that the provisions of the Partition Ordinance do not apply to lands

of the character of those in question.

In my view, Martin v. Hatana (1913) 16 NLR 92 is an eye-opener and

provides insights into solving the issue of indivisibility. In this case the

plaintiff ninda lord filed action against several nilakarayas in terms of

section 25 of the Service Tenures Ordinance to recover damages in a sum

50

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

of Rs. 25.40 for the value of services due by them. The position of the 14th

defendant was that if the defendants are liable, his company is not liable

to pay more than what is proportionate to the share of land owned by

his company. Lascelles C.J. did not in my view reject this position on the

sole basis that payment of commuted dues is indivisible on principle. His

Lordship at page 93 also took into consideration that dividing the

commuted dues among several nilakarayas would create practical

difficulties for the ninda lord, including the need for surveys and share

valuation, the cost of which would outweigh the damages to be recovered:

In view of these authorities, which represent the view commonly held

as to the obligation of the tenants of a panguwa, and on account of

the practical difficulty of distributing the liability, I think that the

decision in C.R. Ratnapura, No. 284, is one which might properly be

reconsidered by a Collective Court when the question comes up in a

suitable form. But in the present case it is not necessary to take this

course. The action is one for damages under section 25 of Ordinance

No. 4 of 1870, a section which clearly enables the proprietor to sue

the holders of the panguwa collectively. I fail to see that under this

section it is open for one of the tenants to claim that his liability

should be restricted to an amount of damages which is proportionate

to his holding in the panguwa. To allow this claim would be

inequitable to the proprietor, for the proportionate share of each

tenant could not be ascertained without a survey and probably a

valuation, the costs of which, in cases like the present, would far

exceed the whole amount of damages. Whatever may be the law as

to the divisibility of the liability to render services, or to pay the

commutation for services, I think that when it comes to recovering

damages, in a case where the liability has not been apportioned, the

damages are recoverable from the tenants jointly.

51

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

I think the concept of indivisibility of service and commuted dues should

not be promoted or retained on the basis of convenience to the ninda lord

or on the basis of potential litigation costs to the ninda lord. Such

considerations are typical in any litigation, and there is no need for

preferential treatment for the ninda lord.

In Appuhamy v. Menike the unanimous view of the Court was that the

service of a paraveni nilakaraya is indivisible and on that ground

paraveni nilakarayas cannot institute a partition action in respect of a

paraveni panguwa. Ennis J. at page 363 states In my opinion a paraveni

nilakaraya holds all the rights which, under Maarsdorps definition,

constitute ownership, but he, nevertheless, does not possess the full

ownership, in that the ninda lord holds a perpetual right to service, the

obligation to perform which attaches to the land.

If the obligation to perform service is tied to the land, it is questionable

as to how it would pose a difficulty for the partition of the land as the

obligation can naturally transfer with the land and attach to the separate

lots upon partition. This is how constructive or charitable trusts, leases

at will, or those for periods not exceeding one month continue to exist

after the partition decree, even if they are not specifically included in the

decree.

The feudal system has long gone. The ninda lord, if interested, should

work towards finding a mechanism to obtain services from nilakarayas

after partition rather than merely echoing what was said centuries ago

that service is inherently indivisible.

Even assuming that the services to be rendered in their nature are

indivisible, after the enactment of the Service Tenures Ordinance, such

services can be commuted to a quantifiable monetary payment

recoverable in accordance with the procedure laid down in sections 24

52

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

and 25 of the Ordinance. Hence there is no justifiable reason to deny

partition in respect of pangu land on the basis that service is indivisible.

It must be noted that under section 48(1) of the Partition Law No. 21 of

1977, the partition decree shall be free from all encumbrances

whatsoever other than those specified in that decree. Thus, the Court can

specify in the partition decree the encumbrances attached to the

allotments.

Section 48(1) of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 further states that the

term encumbrance means any mortgage, lease, usufruct, servitude, life

interest, trust, or any interest whatsoever howsoever arising except a

constructive or charitable trust, a lease at will or for period not exceeding

one month. Constructive or charitable trusts, leases at will or for period

not exceeding one month will continue to remain as encumbrances

whether or not specified in the decree.

In the repealed Partition Ordinance, No. 10 of 1863, section 9 dealt with

the conclusive effect of a partition decree, and sections 12 and 13

explicitly preserved the status of mortgages and leases, indicating that

they would not be affected by the partition decree, regardless of whether

they were included in it. However, unlike mortgages and leases, there was

no express provision protecting constructive trusts or fidei commissa

after a decree for partition was entered.

Nevertheless, the Full Bench of the Supreme Court in Marikar v. Marikar

(1920) 22 NLR 137, having reviewed the conflicting previous decisions

authoritatively held:

A trust, express or constructive, is not extinguished by a decree for

partition, and attaches to the divided portion, which on the partition

is assigned to the trustee.

53

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

In the Privy Council decision of Nadesan v. Ramasamy (1961) 63 NLR 49

it was held:

Where property burdened with a fidei commissum under a deed of

gift has been partitioned under the Partition Ordinance No. 10 of

1863, such partition has not the effect of destroying the fidei

commissum which thereafter attaches to the land allotted in

severalty to the fiduciaries or his successor in title, even though no

mention has been made of his capacity in the partition decree.

Section 9 of the Ordinance has no bearing upon the rights of fidei

commissaries who have no present right or interest in the land which

is being partitioned. They are not owners or co-owners to whom

Section 2 can apply.

These decisions illustrate that, in suitable cases, the Court is not

precluded from introducing encumbrances that are not explicitly

specified by the statute.

Therefore, once a paraveni pangu is partitioned, the District Court can

specify in the decree that partition is subject to service. However, the

failure to mention it should not prevent the ninda lord from exercising

his rights under the Service Tenures Ordinance and Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance. The perpetual rights of the ninda lord in respect

of paraveni pangu shall in no way extinguish or affect, regardless of

whether they are explicitly mentioned in the partition decree since his

rights are attached to the land (as opposed to a personal service) and

carry with it even after the partition.

Human dignity

Both ancient and contemporary historical authorities unequivocally

support the view that the rajakariya system was fundamentally rooted in

the caste system. (Robert Knox, An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon

54

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

(2nd ed, Tisara prakashakayo, 1989) 139-140; John DOyly, A Sketch of

the Constitution of the Kandyan Kingdom (2nd ed, Tisara prakashakayo,

1975) 67-68; M.U. De Silva, Land tenure, Caste System and the

Rjakriya, under Foreign Rule: A Review of Change in Sri Lanka under

Western Powers, 1597-1832, (1992) Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society

of Sri Lanka 5)

Sri Lankan society has undergone significant transformations since the

era of monarchy, and the preservation of vestiges of the feudal system,

particularly regarding the role of paraveni nilakarayas, practically based

on caste, may no longer be necessary. The question of the ninda lords

rights now warrants the exploration of novel approaches.

Caste-based discrimination is an outright violation of human rights.

Human rights are the rights we have simply because we exist as human

beings. They are inherent to all of us, regardless of caste, class, colour,

race, gender, religion or any other status. Human rights spring from

human dignity. In all the religious doctrines, such as Buddhism,

Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, human dignity is revered as a

fundamental and sacred principle.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United

Nations General Assembly in 1948, stands as the first legal document to

delineate the fundamental human rights to be universally protected. This

is the foundation of international human rights law including human

rights conventions, treaties and other legal instruments. Article 1 thereof

states All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

Article 2(1) states Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set

forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race,

colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social

origin, property, birth or other status. Article 7 states All are equal before

the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of

55

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in

violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such

discrimination.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, along with the two

covenants, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and

the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights,

adopted by the United Nations in 1966, collectively form a comprehensive

body of human rights.

While international law instruments may not be directly used to modify

the domestic law, the importance of interpreting the law in light of the

international standards has been stressed in several cases. I am

reminded of the dictum of Amarasinghe J. in the landmark judgment of

Bulankuluma and Others v. Secretary, Ministry of Industrial Development

and Others [2000] 3 Sri LR 243 at 274-275, where His Lordship, in

reference to the U.N. Stockholm Declaration (1972) and the U.N. Rio De

Janeiro Declaration (1992), stated:

Admittedly, the principles set out in the Stockholm and Rio De

Janeiro Declarations are not legally binding in the way in which an

Act of our Parliament would be. It may be. It may be regarded merely

as soft law. Nevertheless, as a Member of the United Nations, they

could hardly be ignored by Sri Lanka. Moreover, they would, in my

view, be binding if they have been either expressly enacted or

become a part of the domestic law by adoption by the superior

Courts of record and by the Supreme Court in particular, in their

decisions.

Although this is not a fundamental right application, Article 4(d) of the

Constitution states The fundamental rights which are by the Constitution

declared and recognized shall be respected, secured and advanced by

56

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

all the organs of government and shall not be abridged, restricted or

denied, save in the manner and to the extent hereinafter provided. One of

the three organs of the government is the judiciary, the other two being

the legislature and the executive.

The Svasti of our Constitution inter alia assures equality and

fundamental human rights that guarantees the dignity of the People

of Sri Lanka. Fundamental rights spring from human rights. Article 3 of

our Constitution states that sovereignty includes fundamental rights.

Fundamental rights include equality and non-discrimination. Article

12(1) of the Constitution states All persons are equal before the law and

are entitled to the equal protection of the law. Article 12(2) states No

citizen shall be discriminated against on the grounds of race, religion,

language, caste, sex, political opinion, place of birth or any one of such

grounds.

Under directive principles of state policy, Article 27(2)(a) states that the

State is devoted to establishing a democratic socialist society with one of

its objectives being the full realization of the fundamental rights and

freedoms of all persons. Article 27(6) states The State shall ensure

equality of opportunity to citizens, so that no citizen shall suffer any

disability on the ground of race, religion, language, caste, sex, political

opinion or occupation. Article 27(7) states The State shall eliminate

economic and social privilege and disparity and the exploitation of man by

man or by the State.

In this backdrop, where both the international and domestic law strongly

condemn and discourage the discriminatory practices in society, it is

timely to reconsider whether remnants of the rajakariya system

constitutes an infringement upon human dignity. If a partition action can

be instituted by an owner of a land and a paraveni nilakaraya is

57

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

considered an owner of the land, why he should be prevented from

instituting a partition action on the notion that rajakariya is indivisible?

Conclusion

The questions of law upon which leave has been granted and the answers

are as follows:

(a) Was section 54(1) of the Partition Act No. 16 of 1951 necessitated

due to judicial opinions expressed in judgments that paraveni

nilakaraya is not the owner of the lands appurtenant to his

paraveni panguwa?

That may have been one of the reasons.

(b) Was this judicial opinion reversed by the Privy Council in Attorney

General v. Herath reported in 62 NLR 145?

Yes.

(c) In view of that, was there any need for section 54(1) to continue in

the statute book?

Whether or not there is express provision, the Court can interpret

the law.

(d) If (a) and (b) above are answered in the affirmative and (c) is

answered in the negative, has the Court of Appeal erred in

dismissing the appeal?

The Court of Appeal erred in dismissing the appeal.

(e) If so, are the appellants entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the

Petition of Appeal to the Court of Appeal?

The appellants are entitled to continue with the action in the

District Court.

The Partition Law does not restrict institution of partition actions by

persons who have full ownership in the land. The paraveni nilakaraya is

an owner within the meaning of the term imposed upon it by the context

58

SC/APPEAL/82/2010

of the Partition Law. A partition action can be instituted by a nilakaraya

in respect of a land subject to rajakariya.

The obligation to perform services attaches to the land. Therefore, such

obligation, upon partition, shall attach to the separate lots in severalty.

The perpetual rights of the ninda lord in respect of paraveni pangu will

in no way extinguish or affect whether or not specified in the partition

decree.

The impugned order of the District Court and the judgment of the Court

of Appeal are set aside and the appeal is allowed with costs in all three

Courts.

The learned District Judge is directed to procced with the trial and deliver

the judgment according to the law.
