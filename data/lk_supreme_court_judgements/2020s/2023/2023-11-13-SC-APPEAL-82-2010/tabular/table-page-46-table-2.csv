"that each of the nilakarayas of a panguwa was liable only for the share"
"of the service which is proportionate to his share in the panguwa."
"The  Commissioner  has  decided,  as  this  Court  thinks  erroneously,"
"that  each  is  liable  for  the  whole.  We  are  not  aware  of  any  law  or"
"custom by which one of such nilakarayaâ€™s of a panguwa is liable to"
"render services for the whole panguwa, that is to say, for himself as"
"well  as  his  co-tenants.  The  mere  fact  of  the  Commissioner  having"
"valued  the  services  of  the  whole  panguwa,  instead  of  valuing  the"
"services of each nilakaraya, cannot create a liability which did not"
"exist before."
