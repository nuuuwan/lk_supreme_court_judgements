"nilakaraya could bring an action under the Partition Ordinance 10 of"
"1863  to partition  a holding  which he held  with others. Two  points"
"had to be decided. The first whether a paraveni nilakaraya was an"
"owner,  the  second  was  whether  the  nature  of  the  services  to  be"

"been a conflict of authority and the case on appeal was referred for"

"Ennis, J. came to the conclusion set out above [i.e. “In my opinion a"
"paraveni  nilakaraya  holds  all  the  rights  which,  under  Maasdorp’s"
"definition,  constitute  ownership  but  he  nevertheless  does  not"
"possess full ownership in that the ninda lord holds a perpetual right"
"to service, the obligation to perform which attaches to the land”]. De"
"Sampayo, J. said “I am of opinion that paraveni nilakarayas are the"
"owners  of  the  land”.  Shaw,  J.  dissented.  It  will  be  seen  that  the"
"majority of the court were of opinion that a paraveni nilakaraya is"
"an owner. With this view their Lordships are in entire agreement."
