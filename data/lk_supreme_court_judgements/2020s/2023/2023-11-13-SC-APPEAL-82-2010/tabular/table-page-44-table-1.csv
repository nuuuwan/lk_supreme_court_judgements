"performed nor dues paid  in respect of the land,  the subject of this"
"action for a period of ten years. No evidence has been tendered by"
"the  appellants  that  such  services  were  performed  or  dues  paid  in"
"respect of other lands of the panguwa. In view of the fact that the"
"plaintiffs had proved that no services were performed nor dues paid"
"in respect of the land sought to be partitioned, I am of opinion that"
"the  burden  of  proof  rested  on  the  defendants  to  show  that  such"
"performances were made or dues paid in respect of other lands of"
"the panguwa."
