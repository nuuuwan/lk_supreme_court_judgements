"assign  such  holdings  to  people  subject  to  service  (rajakariya).  Such"
"people  are  known  as  nilakarayas  (නිලකාරයා).  Nilakarayas  were  of  two"
"kinds,  namely  paraveni  nilakaraya 
(පරදේනි  නිලකාරයා)  and  maruwena"
"nilakaraya (මාරුදවන නිලකාරයා). Paraveni nilakaraya’s panguwa is known"
"as  paraveni  panguwa 
(පරදේනි  පංගුව)  whereas  maruwena  nilakaraya’s"
"panguwa 
is  known  as  maruvena  panguwa 
(මාරුදවන  පංගුව).  Paraveni"
"nilakarayas  are  those  who  held  their  lands  before  the  nindagama  or"
"viharagama or dewalagama was granted to the ninda lord, and maruvena"
"nilakarayas  are  those  who  received  their  lands  from  the  ninda  lord"
"subsequent  to  the  royal  grant.  Paraveni  nilakarayas  are  hereditary"
"holders in perpetuity of the pangu subject to the performance of different"
"services  to  the  ninda  lord  who  could  be  the  chief  of  the  temple  or"
"dewalaya.  In  practical  terms,  maruwena  nilakarayas  also  fall  into  the"
"same 
category.  However, 
paraveni  nilakaraya 
is  now 
statutorily"
"recognised as a holder of a paraveni pangu in perpetuity by section 2 of"
"the Service Tenures Ordinance No. 4 of 1870."
