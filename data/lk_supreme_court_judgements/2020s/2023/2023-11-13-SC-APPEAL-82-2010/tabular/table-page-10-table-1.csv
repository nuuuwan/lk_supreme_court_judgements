"","The theory of the old Sinhalese constitution, as much as that of the"
"","English constitution, was that the king was the lord paramount of"
"","all  the  land,  and  on  this  basis  the  Sinhalese  king  granted  away"
"","whole villages to temples or individual persons, though much of the"
"","land was already held by private parties. A village so granted to a"
"","temple is a viharagama or dewalagama, and a village granted to an"
