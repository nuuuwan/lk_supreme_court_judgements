"SC/APPEAL/82/2010"
"It appears to me that Ordinance No. 10 of 1863 was not intended to"
"be 
limited  to  persons  who  have  an  absolute  ownership 
in  the"
"property, but that it also includes one who has an undivided share"
"vested in him as trustee. The English Courts have allowed a partition"
"suit to be brought by freehold tenants in possession, whether they"
"are entitled in fee simple, or in fee tail or for life, and there have been"
"cases in which they have allowed a partition action where an estate"
"was vested in a person for a term of years only. The trustee under"
"the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance appears to me to be the owner"
"of the temple property subject to the terms of the trust on which the"
"property is vested in him, and I see no reason why he should not be"
"allowed to bring an action for partition under Ordinance No. 10 of"
"1863. No authority has been cited to us in which it has been held"
"that  such  a 
trustee  cannot  bring  a  partition  suit  under 
that"
"Ordinance.  This  Court  has  recognized  the  rights  of  executors  and"
"administrators as parties to a partition suit under Ordinance No. 10"
"of 1863, and having allowed trustees to  be parties in such suits I"
"see no reason why a trustee created by statute should be excluded"
"from the right of bringing a partition suit, unless there is anything in"
"the statute which limits the power of the trustee and prohibits him"
"from bringing such an action."
