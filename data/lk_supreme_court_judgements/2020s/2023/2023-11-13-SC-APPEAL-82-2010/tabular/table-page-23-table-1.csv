"dated 29.06.2004 and 02.09.2004 who says a paraveni pangu can be"
"partitioned subject to rajakariya."
"However,  as  I  pointed  out  earlier,  in  the  interpretation  section  of  the"
"Nindagama  Lands  Act,  there  was  a  reference  excluding  viharagam  and"
"devalagam  from  the  operation  of  the  Act.  Therefore,  whether  paraveni"
"nilakarayas in viharagam and devalagam can institute a partition action"
"remains unresolved."
"With this in view, a Bill was presented to Parliament in this year (which"
"was  gazetted  on  23.02.2023)  to  amend  the  Partition  Law  introducing"
"provisions  similar  to  section  54  of  the  Partition  Act  No.  16  of  1951"
"expressly stating that  paraveni nilakaraya can file a partition action to"
"partition  a  paraveni  pangu  in  a  temple  land  according  to  the  Partition"
"Law. Following are the proposed amendments to the principal statute."
