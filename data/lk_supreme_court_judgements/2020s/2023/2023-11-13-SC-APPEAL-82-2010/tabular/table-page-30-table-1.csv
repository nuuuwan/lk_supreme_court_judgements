"example,  deals  with 
the  case  of 
landed  property  belonging 
in"
"common to two or more owners, and authorizes one or more of such"
"owners to compel partition."
"This difficulty is largely reduced, if it is not altogether removed, when"
"it is remembered that by the Roman-Dutch Law the fiduciarius was"
"a true owner; he had a real though a burdened right of ownership."
"It is also material that in David v. Sarnelis Appu 7 N.L.R. 163 this"
"Court  held 
that  a 
trustee  under 
the  Buddhist  Temporalities"
"Ordinance was an owner for the purposes of the Partition Ordinance."
"In my opinion the balance of reason and authority is in favour of the"
"view that property subject to fidei commissum may be the subject of"
"partition,  and  I  hold,  in  the  case  under  consideration,  that  the"
"property in dispute, though subject to fidei commissum, was lawfully"
"partitioned."
"But  the  partition  decree  in  no  way  extinguishes  the  reversionary"
"interest  of  the  fidei  commissarius.  It  merely  sets  apart  a  specific"
"portion  of 
the  common  estate 
to  which 
the  rights  of 
the 
fidei"
"commissarius attach in severalty."
"By no reasonable construction of the Ordinance can it be held that"
"the  effect  of  a  partition  decree  is  to  enlarge  the  life  interest  of  the"
"fiduciarius into absolute ownership. In the words of Lord Watson in"
"Tillekeratne  v.  Abeysekere  (2  N.L.R.  313):  “…the  partition…would"
"not necessarily destroy a fidei commissum attaching to one or more"
"of the shares before partition.”"
