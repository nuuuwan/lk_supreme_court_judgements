"ninda  lord.  It  is  also  common  ground  that  the  type  of  nilakaraya"
"known as a “maruwena nilakaraya” holds the land as a tenant at"
"will  and 
the 
type  known  as  a  “paraveni  nilakaraya” 
(second"
"respondent  belonged  to  this  type)  holds  the  land  in  perpetuity.  It"
"was, as stated by the learned Chief Justice, a “hereditary holding”."
"The  learned  Chief  Justice  makes  a  forceful  point  in  support  of  the"
"view that a “paraveni nilakaraya” must be regarded as a tenant and"
"not  as  an  owner  when  he  points  out  that  in  certain  legislation"
"language is used which seems to imply that a “paraveni nilakaraya”"
"must be regarded as a tenant and not as an owner. For instance, in"
"Section  27  of  the  Buddhist  Temporalities  Ordinance 
(Volume  V"
"Ceylon Legislative Enactments p. 655) the words “a paraveni pangu"
"tenant’s interest” are used. The Service Tenures Ordinance 4 of 1870"
"(Volume  VI  Ceylon  Legislative  Enactments  p.  657)  uses  the  words"
"“nindagama proprietor” to designate a ninda lord:-"
"“nindagama  proprietor”  shall  mean  any  proprietor  of  nindagama"
"entitled 
to  demand  services 
from  any  paraveni  nilakaraya  or"
"maruwena  nilakaraya,  for  and  in  respect  of  a  praveni  pangu  or"
"maruwena pangu held by him;”."
"This language normally,  in  the  absence  of other relevant  material,"
"would  afford  strong  reason  for 
the  conclusion 
that  a  paraveni"
"nilakaraya does not occupy the status of an owner. But ultimately"
"the  question  whether  a  person 
is  an  owner  or  not  must  be"
"determined by the rights and attributes he possesses in law. If those"
"attributes clearly establish his position as owner the considerations"
"which arise from the language referred to above must give way."
"The “rights of a paraveni nilakaraya in respect of his holding became"
"enlarged in the course of time” as stated by the learned Chief Justice"
"and  this  fact  with  its  accompanying  uncertainty  as  to  what  those"
