Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The three Petitioners namely N.B. Krishantha Kumara, Somasiri Ekanayake, and B.H.M.D. Herath who

are members of the Sir Lanka Planning Service and the 4th Petitioner Planning Service Association

had filed the instant application before this Court challenging the decision of the 1st to the 9th

Respondents contained in the letter dated 08.11.2017 which is produced marked P-10-B, to

implement the Cabinet decision dated 23.06.2010 which is also produced marked as P-12, alleging

that both P-10-B and P-12 are in violation of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to them under

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

The matter was supported before this Court on 28.09.2018 and the Court granted leave to proceed

for the alleged violation of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Petitioners.

After considering an application made by three Intervenient Petitioners namely U.L. Samaratunga,

S.M. Banu, and R.M.N.S. Gunathilake representing the Development Officers, the court granted

permission for the said party to intervene in the instant application as 54th, 55th, and 56th

Respondents.

During the Argument before us, the Respondents raised two preliminary objections, one with regard

to the locus standi of the Petitioner before the Court and the other with regard to the jurisdiction of

this Court in deciding an application filed before this Court under Article 17 read with article 126 for

allegedly violating the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners by a policy decision taken by the

Executive.

The second objection referred to above needs to go into the facts of this matter and in the said

circumstances the said objection will be considered, having considered the merits of this application

17 towards the later part of this judgment. However, the first objection raised will be considered by me

now.

The first and the second Petitioners hold the positions of the Secretary and Assistant Secretary of

the 4th Petitioner Association and the third Petitioner who also belongs to the Sri Lanka Planning

Service is a committee member of the 4th Petitioner Association. The 4th Petitioner, the Planning

Service Association is a trade union registered under section 10 of the Trade Union Ordinance.

Whilst referring to Article 126 (2) of the Constitution the Respondents relied on the decision in Ceylon

Electricity Board Accountants Association V. Patali Champika Ranawaka and Others SC FR 18/2015

SC Minute dated 11.03.2016 where Sripawan CJ had held

.. in the absence of a specific provision permitting a Trade Union to institute action on

behalf of its members, the Petitioner Union cannot have and maintain this application on

behalf of its members in terms of Article 17 read with Article 126 (2) of the Constitution.

Article 126 (2) of the Constitution reads thus;

Where any person alleged that any such Fundamental Rights or Language Right relating to

such person has been infringed or is about to be infringed by executive or administrative

action, he may himself or by an Attorney at Law on his behalf, within one month thereof, in

accordance with such rules of Court as may be in force, apply to the Supreme Court by way

of petition in writing addressed to such Court praying for relief or redress in respect of such

infringement.

It was the argument of the learned Senior State Counsel who represented the Respondents before

us, that the Supreme Court had declined to make a broader definition to the term person referred

to in Article 126 by extending it to unincorporated bodies such as Trade Unions.

18 The impugned decisions, before this Court, the Cabinet decision (P-12), and the letter by the 1st to

the 9th Respondents (P-10-B) refer to the absorption of a certain category of officers into the Sri

Lanka Planning Service (hereinafter referred to as SLPS) on supernumerary basis without making

them eligible for certain benefits in the said service, but the main complaint before this court is that

the said Cabinet decision and the subsequent letter by the 1st to 9th Respondents are in clear violation

of the service minute of the SLPS which affects not only to the 1st to 3rd Respondents before Court

but also to the entire cadre of the Sri Lanka Planning Service and therefore the 4th Respondent being

the Trade Union which represents the entire cadre of the said service is entitled, to prosecute the

instant application in the interest of its membership.

When a similar matter had arisen with the Nurses working in Government Hospitals, the Cabinet of

Ministers approved additional salary increments to the non-striking staff on the recommendation of

the Health Minister, the Pubic Services United Nurses Union, in which the majority of nurses in the

Government Hospitals are members, challenged the said decision before this Court.

In the case of the Public Services United Nurses Union V. Montague Jayawickrema Minister of Public

Administration and Others, 1988 1 Sri LR 229 this Court held that the said decision violates equality

provisions contained in Article 12 since the said decision had granted an ad hoc increment to a very

limited class of officers.

However, in the case of Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants Association V. Patali Champika

Ranawaka and Others (Supra), the Supreme Court upheld an objection raised by the Respondents

with regard to the maintainability of the said application on the ground that the Petitioner being a

Trade Union has no locus standi to institute an application in terms Article 126 of the Constitution.

When deciding the above, Chief Justice Sripawan was mindful of the instances where this Court had

permitted unincorporated bodies or persons to institute and maintain applications under Article 17

19 read with 126 (2) of the Constitution including the case of Public Services United Nurses Union V.

Montague Jayawickrama and Others (supra).

Whilst referring to the Nurses Union case referred above Sripawan CJ observed;

I do not find myself able to accede to the argument advanced by Mr. for two

reasons. Firstly, no objection was taken by the Respondents in the said application that the

Public Services United Nurses Union had no locus standi to institute an application under

Article 126 of the Constitution and the Court did not have the benefit of any argument of the

learned counsel on that issue. Secondly, in any event, the second Petitioner was a Nurse and

the Secretary of the First Petitioner Union, whose Fundamental Right of equality guaranteed

under Article 12 had been violated. Furthermore, the Second Petitioner is a Person within

the meaning of Article 126 (2) of the Constitution. Thus, the case could have proceeded even

if the First Petitioner, namely Public Services United Nurses Union was struck down

With regard to an Incorporated body, a similar objection was raised by the Respondents in the case

of Environmental Foundation Ltd. V. Urban Development Authority (2009) 1 Sri LR 123 and S. N

Silva CJ considered the said objection as follows;

An objection has been raised that the Petitioner cannot have and maintain this application,

since it is an incorporated company and that the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article

12 (1) and 14 (1) (a) can be invoked only by persons and in the case of Article 14 (1)(a) by a

citizen. In my view, the word persons as appearing in Article 12 (1) should not be restricted

to natural persons but extended to all entities having legal personality. In several cases, this

Court has given relief to incorporated bodies that have a legal personality recognized by

law.. Although counsel contended that Article 14 (1) should be read differently in view of

the reference to a citizen I am of the view that this distinction does not carry with it a

20

difference that would enable a company incorporated in Sri Lanka, to vindicate an

infringement under Article 12 (1) and disqualify it from doing so in respect of an infringement

under Article 14 (1).

..

In several cases, the Petitioner has assisted this Court in important matters with regard to the

preservation of the environment. In this instance too the Petitioner has acted in the public

interest.

However, Sripawan CJ whilst referring to the decision in Environmental Foundation Ltd. (supra) and

made a distinction between the two cases in the case of Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants

Association (supra) as follows;

His Lordship further noted that in several cases this Court has given relief to incorporated

bodies that have a legal personality recognized by law In any event, Environment

Foundation Ltd. (supra) case was filed in the public interest in order to preserve, safeguard

and protect the public interest. Hence incorporated bodies recognized by law were permitted

to file action in terms of Article 126 (2) of the Constitution.

The learned Presidents Counsel who represented the Petitioner in the case of Ceylon Electricity

Board Accountants Association (supra) made an attempt at a later stage to add one of its office

bearers as an added Petitioner, but the said application was objected to by the Respondents. The

said move by the Petitioner in Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants Association (supra) is a clear

admission by the Petitioner himself with regard to the locus standi of the Petitioner in the said case.

In these circumstances it is clear that the locus standi of an unincorporated body that comes before

the Supreme Court in an application filed under Article 17 read with Article 126 (2) is now settled

21 and the Court has permitted the members of the unincorporated body to pursue the application in

the instances when their rights guaranteed under the constitution has been violated by the conduct

of the Respondents. Therefore, I see no merit in the first objection raised by the Respondents before

this Court.

With regard to the impugned Cabinet decision produced mark P-12 and the subsequent decision

taken by the Public Service Commission which is contained in the letter produced P-10 B, the

Petitioners have submitted as follows;

a) That according to the service minute of the SLPS which was operative until the Public

Administration Circular 6/2006 was published in Government Gazette 1134/5 on 30.05.2000,

the said service consisted of Class II Grade II, Class II Grade I, and Class I officers.

b) That a new service minute was introduced to the SLPS in terms of Public Administration

Circular 6/2006 by Government Gazette 1670/32, which was published on 10.09.2010.

According to this service minute the said service consists of four grades namely, Grade III,

Grade II, Grade I, and Special Grade.

c) That the recruitment Grade under the previous service minute was Class II Grade II of Sri

Lanka Planning Service and under the new service minute it is Grade III.

d) That under both these schemes, provisions had been made to recruit officers under two main

streams, namely open and limited and there was a minimum requirement of obtaining 40%

of the total mark from a written examination, in order to get through the examination under

both schemes.

e) That according to Clause 6.4 of the service minute which was operative until 2010, 75% of

the vacancies in Class II Grade II of the SLPS were to be filled on the results of the Open

Competitive Examination, and the balance 25% by the Limited Competitive Examination.

22

f) That the Cabinet of Ministers had arrived at a decision on 24.10.2007 to allow a group of

officers to sit for a special examination instead of the examination identified in Clause 6.5 in

the service minute in order to absorb them to Class II Grade II of the SLPS on Supernumerary

basis.

g) That the said Cabinet decision and the Instructions issued by the Public Service Commission

in order to implement the said Cabinet decision were challenged before the Supreme Court

by two parties and those matters namely SC FR 236/2008 and 237/2008 were pending before

the Supreme Court for determination even at the time the instant application was taken up

for hearing before the present bench.

h) That by Government Gazette 1565 dated 29.08.2008 which was amended by Government

Gazette 1587 dated 30.01.2009 applications were called from the eligible candidates to sit

for the said examination.

i) That the minimum requirement to get through the said examination was unchanged and

under paragraph 13 of the Government Gazette 1565 dated 29.08.2008 it was stated that;

j) That the said examination to appoint officers to Class II Grade II of the Sri Lanka Planning

Service on a supernumerary basis was held in April 2009 and steps were taken to recruit those

who got through the said examination by obtaining the minimum requirement of 40% of the

total mark.

23

k) That, a Cabinet Memorandum dated 10.06.2009 was submitted by the then Minister of

Finance and Planning seeking approval to reduce the pass marks from 40% to 30% for the

reasons contained in paragraph 3 of the said memorandum, which reads as follows;

to the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning by P-6.

m) That the above decision to deviate from the original scheme approved by the Cabinet of

Ministers was never challenged, and steps were taken to implement the said decision.

n) That subsequent to the introduction of the new scheme of recruitment in 2010, two rounds

of recruitment to Grade III of the SLPS were taken place in 2012 and 2017 based on the new

scheme of recruitment.

o) That when the second round of the recruitment process was in progress the Petitioners were

informed of an attempt to recruit another batch of officers to the Sri Lanka Planning Service

from those who faced the special examination in the year 2009 and had not succeeded in

obtaining 30% as required by the Cabinet decision dated 10.06.2009.

p) That the Petitioners made requests from the Public Service Commission and the office of the

Cabinet of Ministers under the provisions of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016 in

order to obtain information with regard to any decision reached in that regard and the

24

decision of the Public Service Commission dated 17.11.2017 (P10-B) was communicated to

the 1st Petitioner by the Public Service Commission by letter dated 04.12.2017 (P-10-A)

q) That, it was revealed from the information gathered, that there was another Cabinet

Memorandum dated 17.06.2010 and a Cabinet Decision (P-11 and P-12) to recruit all

candidates who faced the examination which was held in the year 2009 irrespective of any

marks they received but fulfill the other requirements according to the relevant Gazette

notification. However, the said decision was not implemented until 2017, but by letter dated

17.11.2017 (P-10-B), Public Service Commission had instructed the Secretary Public

Administration Ministry to implement the said decision.

In these circumstances the Petitioners have further submitted before this Court, that;

i. The said Cabinet decision dated 23.06.2010 (P-12) and the recent decision taken by the

Public Service Commission to implement the said Cabinet decision as evinced in the letter

dated 17.11.2017 (P10-B) are in gross violation of the service minute of the SLPS and the

Government policy on recruiting officers to the SLPS.

ii. The Petitioners have a legitimate expectation that all requirements and provisions in the

Sri Lanka Planning Service will adhere in strict compliance with the approved service

minute

iii. The service minute clearly specifies that the pass mark for both the Limited and

Competitive Examination is 40

iv. When making the recruitments in 2009, the pass mark was lowered to 30, which is also

in violation of the Service Minute

25

v. The impugned decision of the Public Service Commission has the effect of recruiting to

the Sri Lanka Planning Service, those who failed to score even 30 marks and thereby failed

the examination

vi. Two rounds of recruitment have taken place since 2010 under the new service minute

vii. Grave anomalies would be caused within the SLPS if the impugned decision is

implemented

On behalf of the Respondents, the 1st and the 10th Respondents, the Chairman Public Service

Commission and the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration had tendered affidavits

responding to the allegations made against them by the Petitioners and had denied any violation of

the service minute of the SLPS. The Respondents have also taken up the position, that the

recruitments referred to by the Petitioners had neither violated the legitimate expectations of the

Petitioners nor it created any anomalies in the Sri Lanka Planning Service violating the Fundamental

Rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

In this regard, the 1st and the 10th Respondents have taken up the position that;

a) The secretary to the Ministry of Plan Implementation in consultation with some authorities

decided to absorb the Development Officers who had completed 05 years of satisfactory

service to SLPS Class II Grade II considering the provisions in the scheme of recruitment of the

Development Officers

b) The said decision was challenged before the Court of Appeal in CA 329/2007 and in the

meantime Secretary to the Ministry of Plan Implementation wrote to the Public Service

Commission seeking approval for the absorption of 349 Development officers to Class II Grade

II of SLPS

26

c) However, by letter dated 4th June 2007, the Public Service Commission refused to consent to

the above request and also informed its decision to the Court of Appeal

d) A Cabinet Memorandum titled strengthening the Sri Lanka Planning Service with special

emphasis to plan implementation dated 14th August 2007 was submitted to the Cabinet by

the predecessor in office to the 11th Respondent

e) In the said Cabinet of Memorandum, it was recommended that,

a) a special examination be conducted (by the Sri Lanka Institute of Development

Administration) for these officers to assess their suitability for absorption;

b) the examination focuses primarily on an assessment of applying knowledge

relating to field-level experience in planning and plan implementation.

c) those who are successful at the examination be absorbed into supernumerary

Class II Grade II posts in the SLPS with effect from a prospective date, provided

they have completed five years of continuous active service, been confirmed in

the post, and have passed the first Efficiency Bar examination specified in the

scheme of recruitment;

d) those who are successful at the examination but have not passed the first

Efficiency Bar examination at that time, but complete that examination

subsequently, be absorbed as set out above, with effect from a prospective date

after they pass the First Efficiency Bar Examination;

e) such number of supernumerary posts as are equivalent to the number of

successful candidates be specially created at Class II Grade II level to enable these

appointments to be made and that simultaneously the posts currently held by

those officers are suppressed;

27

f) The Cabinet of Ministers had approved the said recommendation and the said decision was

communicated to the Public Service Commission in order to grant relief as proposed in the

Cabinet Memorandum

g) By letter dated 28th September 2007 the Public Service Commission had voiced its

disagreement with the implementation of the said Cabinet Decision

h) The Cabinet of Ministers by its decision dated 10.10.2007, rescinded the earlier decision and

appointed an official committee to formulate a promotional scheme to the development

officers in order to address the grievances of the development officers.

i) On the recommendations of the said Committee the Cabinet of Ministers by its decision dated

24.10.2007 granted approval to conduct a special examination and appoint successful

candidates to the Sri Lanka Planning Service on a supernumerary basis.

j) Applications were called from those who were eligible to sit for the special examination

referred to above by Government Gazette dated 29.08.2008 and those who were eligible to

sit for the examination were identified in the notice itself.

k) According to the said notice;

i. The post advertised (Class II Grade II of SLPS) is permanent and pensionable

but is on a supernumerary basis and personal to the successful candidate who

obtains more than 40 marks from the special examination

ii. If the candidates intend obtaining other benefits and promotions in the SLPS,

he/she will have to face the competitive examination held under the

provisions of the service minute of the SLPS.

l) The special examination referred to above was held and steps were taken to give

appointments to the successful candidates. However, by Cabinet Memorandum dated

28

10.06.2009, approval was sought to reduce the pass mark to 30% to grant further relief to

the candidates. Cabinet has approved the said memorandum.

m) By another Cabinet Memorandum submitted to the Cabinet on 23.06.2010 by the Minister

of Finance and Planning, approval was sought from the Cabinet to absorb the balance of

candidates who sat for the special examination into the SLPS.

The Cabinet approval granted to the said memorandum is as follows;

n) Subsequent to the above approval, the qualifications of all the candidates who were not

eligible under the two previous Cabinet decisions were also checked by an interview panel,

and out of 242 candidates interviewed, 146 were shortlisted and another Cabinet

Memorandum was submitted on 23.03.2011 recommending that they may be given

appointments based on the previous Cabinet approval.

o) However due to reasons not revealed before this court, the Cabinet of Ministers at their

meeting on 26.04.2011 sought the views of the Minister of Public Administration and Home

Affairs, without approving the Cabinet Paper submitted before the Cabinet.

29

p) The Public Service Commission which was defunct during this period was reconstituted on

19.05.2011 and the appointments to the Public Service were since then vested with the Public

Service Commission and no steps were taken by the Public Service Commission to make those

appointments until P-10-B was issued by the Public Service Commission in November 2017

directing those appointments be made with effect from 23.06. 2010 without back wages.

As further observed by this Court, the incumbent Chairman of the Public Service Commission, the 1st

Respondent before this court when submitting an affidavit before this court had justified its decision

contained in P-10-B stating that the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers dated 23.06.2010 (P-12) has

not yet been canceled and it is a policy decision and the Public Service Commission has now decided

to implement the said Cabinet decision.

In addition to the Respondents who were represented before this court by the learned Senior State

Counsel, this Court had permitted three Intervenient Parties, i.e., 54th, 55th, and 56th Respondents to

make a submission through their counsel before this Court.

On behalf of the 54th to the 56th Intervenient Respondents, several objections were raised and they

objected to the granting of any relief to the Petitioners.

It was submitted on behalf of them that the Cabinet of Ministers has acknowledged the grievance of

the Development Officers who were represented before this Court by the 54th to 56th Intervenient

Respondents. As submitted by them the only promotional prospect according to their service minute

was referred to in note 3 to the scheme of Recruitment as, provisions will be made for the

recruitment of Department Officers to the Planning Service after 5 years of satisfactory Service.

30 By 2007 majority of the Development Officers attached to the Ministry of Planning had completed 5

years of service without any promotional opportunity. Even though the service minute of the SLPS

introduced in the year 2000 had included the post of Development Officer to its schedule E and

under clause 6.5 provisions were made to hold a Limited Competitive Examination to recruit 25% of

its vacancies, no such examination was held for 07 years depriving promotional opportunities to

Development Officers.

According to the 54th to 56th Respondents, several services other than Development Officers were

included in schedule E and those services were also eligible to sit for the said examination along

with the Development officers and therefore the only promotional opportunity available to the

Development Officers could not be resolved effectively even by conducting the Limited Competitive

Examination in the year 2008 to fill 100 vacancies. In the said circumstances the Respondents argue

that conducting the Special Examination as provided by the Cabinet decision dated 24.10.2007 to

recruit Development Officers to the SLPS Grade II Class II on a supernumerary basis was not in

violation of the Fundamental Rights of the officers in SLPS.

On behalf of the Intervenient Respondents, it was further submitted that there were several issues

with regard to the question paper in the Special Examination and therefore the Cabinet of Ministers

had first reduced the pass mark to 30 by Cabinet decision dated 10.06.2009 and thereafter decided

to recruit all Development Officers who fulfill the other requirement to the Post of Grade II Class II

officer in SLPS by the impugned Cabinet decision dated 23.06.2010. It was further submitted on

behalf of the Intervenient Respondents that both Cabinet decisions referred to above are policy

decisions taken by the Cabinet of Ministers in resolving the promotional prospects of the

Development Officers in the Planning Ministry.

31 At the time this case was taken up for argument, the court was unaware of the two applications that

were pending before this court, where several parties have challenged the Decision of the Cabinet

of Ministers arrived on 24.10.2007 with regard to the appointments made to Class II Grade II of the

SLPS on supernumerary basis. However, after the arguments were concluded and the judgment was

reserved, His Lordship the Chief Justice nominated this bench to hear the two cases which were

pending before this Court for determination at that time. At that stage, this Court notified all parties,

including the Petitioners, Respondents, and the Intervenient Parties in all three applications i.e., SC

FR 460/2017, SC FR 236/2008, SC FR 237/2008, and with the consent of all parties, decided to

conclude arguments in SC FR 236/2008 and SC FR 237/2008 before the delivery of the judgment in

the instant case. 54th,55th, and 56th Respondents in SC FR 460/2017 were also represented at the

argument of those two cases and the parties finally agreed for this Court to deliver a separate

judgment in SC FR 460/2017 and to deliver a combined judgment in SC FR 236/2008 and

SC FR 237/2008.

The argument in SC FR 236/2008 and SC FR 237/2008 had enlightened this Court, of the background

to the Cabinet decision dated 24th October 2007, and the Respondents in those proceedings had also

taken up the objection, that the decision challenged in those applications was a policy decision of

the Cabinet of Ministers and therefore it was not amenable to the Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction

of this Court.

The extent to which a Cabinet decision could be challenged before the Supreme Court was discussed

in the case of Samastha Lanka Nidahas Grama Niladhari Sangamaya and Others V. D. Dissanayake,

Secretary, Public Administration and Ministry of Home Affairs, and Others SC Appeal 158/2010 SC

minute 14.06.2013 as follows;

32

The first substantive question that has to be determined on appeal, in this case, is purely

one of the vires and arises in the context of certain constitutional provisions which seek to

distinguish between two categories of decisions that can be made by the executive arm of

Government. The first of these are decisions relating to the appointment, transfer, dismissal

and disciplinary control of public officers, which was vested in the Public Service Commission

by Article 55 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka

(hereinafter referred to as the Constitution of Sri Lanka) as amended by the Seventeenth

Amendment thereto, which was in force at the time of the pronouncement of the impugned

judgment of the Court of Appeal. The second of these categories are decisions pertaining to

policy, which in the context of the public service are exclusively vested in the Cabinet of

Ministers by Article 55 (4) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, as amended by the Seventeenth

Amendment.

In the case of Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya V. Sri Lanka Hadabima Authority SC Appeal 15/2013

Supreme Court minute 16.12.2015 this court further observed that;

As pointed out earlier under Articles 42 and 55 of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers

are performing executive functions under the Constitution and their decisions can be either

policy decisions or administrative decisions or both. Accordingly, the decisions of the Cabinet

of Ministers other than the policy decisions are amenable to judicial review.

Therefore, it is clear that every decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers cannot be excluded from

it being challenged under Article 126 of the Constitution unless there is proof that the decision

challenged before the Court is a Policy decision of the Cabinet of Ministers.

As observed by this Court, the Cabinet decision challenged in SC FR 236/2008 and SC SF 237/2008.

i.e., the Cabinet decision dated 24. 10.2007 and the impugned Cabinet decision in the instant case,

33 i.e., the decision dated 23.06.2010 both referred to the appointment of Development Officers to the

SLPS Class II Grade II on a supernumerary basis based on a Special Examination held for the selection

of those officers. However, we observe a significant difference between the two decisions for the

reason that, the 1st Cabinet decision refers to a selection criterion based on the recommendations of

the Committee of officials appointed by the Cabinet, to the effect,

a) A Special Examination be held at which their suitability will be tested.

b) The successful candidates be recruited to the SLPS on a supernumerary basis. (emphasis

by me)

but the impugned cabinet decision recommends absorbing the balance candidates (who were

not successful under the above criterion) who sat for the Special Examination, if they have fulfilled

the other requirement, to be absorbed to Class II Grade II of SLPS on a supernumerary basis. In other

words, it recommends absorbing those who had failed the Special Examination held under the 1st

Cabinet decision to SLPS Class II Grade II on the supernumerary basis, whereas the 1st decision was

specific to absorbing only those who were successful in the said examination.

The argument of the 54th to the 56th Respondents, that the two Cabinet decisions arrived

subsequently, was to resolve the administrative lapses in conducting the Special Examination, is a

clear indication that the impugned Cabinet decision was not a policy decision by the Cabinet of

Ministers but was an administrative decision by the Cabinet of Ministers.

After analyzing the material placed before this Court in those cases, i.e., SC FR 236/2008 and SC FR

237/2008 this Court has now concluded, that the decision challenged in those cases, i.e., the decision

by the Cabinet of Ministers taken on 24.10.2007 was a policy decision and therefore the said decision

was not amenable to the Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction of this Court. It was further held in those

34 proceedings that, the Cabinet of Ministers by the Cabinet decision dated 24.10.2007 had resolved

and decided the policy on the absorption of Development Officers to Class II Grade II of SLPS.

As already observed in those proceedings the Cabinet of Ministers when reaching the decision to

absorb Development Officers to the SLPS Class II Grade II on a Supernumerary basis based on the

results of the Special Examination held, had first appointed an officials committee comprising of

several very senior public servants and had implemented the recommendations of the said

committee, by way of the Cabinet decision dated 24.10.2007. However, the impugned Cabinet

decision dated 23.06.2010 which is arbitrary in nature had cut across the policy already adopted by

the decision dated 24.10.2007 and approved the appointment of Development Officers who were

not successful and could not obtain the pass mark to become eligible to be absorbed to the SLPS

Class II Grade II on supernumerary basis.

As further revealed before this Court, the Cabinet of Ministers themselves were not impressed with

their own decision and put off the absorption of 146 candidates who were selected after an

interview, based on the Cabinet decision dated 23.06.2010 and sought the view of the Minister of

Public Administration and Home Affairs to implement the recommendations but no progress made

for more than six years.

In the case of Public Services United Nurses Union V. Montague Jayawickrema 1988 1 SLR 229

Wanasundara J had rejected a similar argument when the court observed that the Cabinet Decision

to grant an Ad hoc increment to a group of public servants was in violation of the Fundermental

Rights guaranteed under article 12(1) of the Constitution.

When considering the material discussed above, it is clear that the impugned Cabinet decision dated

23.06.2010 was an arbitrary decision that was contradictory to its own Cabinet decision dated

35 24.10.2007 by which the Government Policy on absorption of Development Officers to the SLPS was

decided.

In the said circumstances, I am of the view that the Petitioners before this Court were successful in

establishing that P-12 and P10B had violated their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article

12(1) of the Constitution.

Therefore, I hold that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners enshrined under Article 12 (1) have

been violated. Accordingly, I quash the Cabinet decision No 10/1317/404/046 dated 23.06.2010

produced marked P-12 and the subsequent decision of the Public Service Commission dated

07.11.2017 marked P-10B.

I make no order with regard to costs.

Application allowed.

Judge of the Supreme Court Justice Murdu N. B. Fernando, PC I agree, Judge of the Supreme Court Justice Yasantha Kodagoda, PC I agree, Judge of the Supreme Court
