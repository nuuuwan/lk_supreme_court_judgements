Janak De Silva, J.

This appeal arises from the judgment of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

(Exercising Original Civil Jurisdiction) Holden in Colombo (High Court) dated 12.12.2006.

In or around December, 1997 and January, 1998, the Plaintiff-Appellants (Appellants)

sold and exported 225 metric tons of parboiled rice to the Defendant-Respondent

(Respondent). It was sold and exported under two invoices bearing numbers

SAC/MS/205/97-98 dated 27.12.1997 (P2) for 100 metric tons of rice to the value of

USD 27,500/- and SAC/MS/217/97-98 dated 02.01.1998 (P4) for 125 metric tons of rice

to the value of USD 34,375/-.

Page 4 of 17

Excluding a part payment of USD 7000/-, made for the amount due under the invoice

marked P2, no further payments were made by the Respondent to settle the amount

owed under these transactions. Therefore, an amount of USD 54,875/- was due to the

Appellants by the Respondent.

By fax dated 07.07.2000 ("P6"), the Appellants requested that the Respondent pay the

outstanding balance. In response, by letter of 21st August, 2000 ("P7"), the Respondent

informed the Appellants that arrangements are being made to settle the said sum of USD

54,875/- within one year. While the Appellants acknowledged the receipt of P7 by letter

dated 23.08.2000 (P8) and thanked the Respondent, subsequently by letter dated

06.11.2000 (P9) they informed the Respondent that the payment of the said sum of USD

54,875/- must be made within one months time.

Since the Respondent failed to make any payment, the Appellants by letter of demand

dated 08.01.2001 called upon the Respondent to make payment within fourteen days of

receipt of the said letter. Subsequently, on or about 01.06.2001, the Appellants brought

this action before the High Court against the Respondent seeking recovery of the said sum

of USD 54,875/-.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge concluded that the Respondent owed the

Appellant USD 54,875/- for rice sold and delivered. However, he dismissed the action on

the basis that it was prescribed. He proceeded on the basis that the action is one for goods

sold and delivered thus falling within the ambit of section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance.

He rejected the position that P7 is an acknowledgement and concluded that, even if taken

into account, the action must fail because it was not based on P7.

Aggrieved by the judgment, the Appellants have preferred this appeal. According to

journal entry dated 02.12.2011, the learned counsel for both parties agreed that the

written submissions maybe confined to the matters set out in paragraph 10 of the Petition

of Appeal. The Respondent has, in his written submissions, sought to put forward the

position that this is a suggestion made by the Court and seeks to rely on other grounds to

oppose this appeal. The journal entry clearly indicates that the grounds on which the

Page 5 of 17

appeal is to be decided was agreed upon by both counsels. Therefore, I am not inclined

to consider reasons other than paragraph 10 of the petition of appeal.

They are:

10. The Plaintiff-Appellants plead that in the circumstances the following substantial

questions of law arise for Your Lordships determination:

(a) Does the letter dated 21.08.2000 marked P7 sent by the Defendant-Respondent to

the Plaintiff-Appellants, amount to an acknowledgment of liability in writing to pay

the sum claimed for in the prayer to the Plaint?

(b) If so, in any event, is the cause of action of the Plaintiff-Appellants set out in the

Plaint, taken out from the limitation imposed in terms of Section 8 of the

Prescription Ordinance?

(c) Thus, has the Learned Judge erred in holding that the cause of action of the Plaintiff-

Appellants is prescribed in law?

Is P7 an acknowledgment of liability?

The first point to be determined is whether the document marked P7 is an

acknowledgment of liability in writing to pay the sum claimed for in the prayer to the

plaint.

However, before addressing this issue, I consider it relevant to deal with a submission

made both before the trial court and before us on behalf of the Respondent. It was argued

that the Respondent did not draft the contents of the document marked P7, but merely

signed a blank document at the Appellants request.

The document marked P7 is addressed to S. Albert and Company, the partnership business

run by the Appellants and it is written on a letter head of M/S Uthaya Enterprises, the sole

proprietorship business owned and run by the Respondent. Most importantly, the letter

is signed by the Respondent, which was accepted by the Respondent during his testimony.

Page 6 of 17

Addressing this submission of the Respondent, the learned Judge of the High Court has

held as follows:

.

Furthermore, the Learned Judge of the High Court answered in the affirmative issue no. 9

raised on behalf of the Appellants which reads as follows:

9. Finally, by his letter dated 21/08/2000 has the defendant requested further one

year to settle the said money?

Hence there is no doubt that the learned High Court Judge considered the document

marked P7 to be a genuine document signed by the Respondent voluntarily with full

knowledge as to its contents.

Page 7 of 17

The primary findings of fact by trial judges who hear and observe witnesses should not be

mildly disturbed on appeal. Moreover, upon perusal of the brief, I find no reason to reject

the findings of the learned Judge of the High Court as to the authenticity of the document

marked P7. As such I will proceed on the basis that the Respondent is the author and

signatory (signee) of the document marked P7.

The relevant parts of P7 read as follows:

NON REALIZATION OF PARBOILED RICE EXPORT BILLS

UNDER INVOICE NO. SAC/MS/205/97-98- USD. 27,500/-

AND INVOICE NO. SAC/MS/217/97-98- USD. 34,375/-

WE ARE ALSO WISH TO STATE THAT OUR BUSINESS AT PRESENT ARE VERY SLOW,

HOWEVER ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE MADE TO SETTLE THE BALANCE OUTSTANDING

AMOUNT OF USD. 54,875/- WITHIN ONE YEARS TIME.

It is seen that the heading of P7 makes specific reference to the invoices marked P2 and

P4. It is followed by an unequivocal statement that arrangements will be made to pay the

outstanding balance within one year. The acknowledgement is in writing and refers to the

exact amount that the Appellants are pursuing. Most significantly, it is signed by the

Respondent. P7 is thus both an acknowledgement of the debt and an undertaking to pay

it within one year. Accordingly, I have no hesitation in holding that the letter dated

21.08.2000 marked P7 sent by the Respondent to the Appellants, amounts to an

acknowledgment of liability in writing to pay the sum claimed for in the prayer to the

Plaint.

If so, in any event, is the cause of action of the Appellants set out in the Plaint, taken out

from the limitation imposed in terms of Section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance?

The question is premised on the basis that the Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871 as

amended (Prescription Ordinance) extinguishes the cause of actions covered in sections

5 to 10 therein and an acknowledgment of the debt takes the cause of action out of the

limitation period. I will begin by reviewing the accuracy of this premise.

Page 8 of 17

The doctrine of prescription works twofold. First, it can allow a person to acquire the

property or servitudes of property belonging to another person by long and uninterrupted

possession by adverse title to the other party. In a sense, this mode permits a person to

acquire new rights while extinguishing the rights enjoyed by another party. This is

acquisitive prescription which is given statutory recognition in section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance. On the other hand, extinctive prescription is where obligations

are extinguished after a specified period of time. In extinctive prescription no new rights

are created unlike acquisitive prescription although one may argue that in theory there is

in fact a right created in one party not to be sued on the extinguished obligation.

Extinctive prescription can operate in two ways. On the one hand, it can prevent an action

from being brought on a debt while safeguarding the debt as a natural obligation. The

South African Prescription Act 1943 is a case in point. On the other hand, it may extinguish

the debt or obligation as the Prescription Act 1969 of South Africa. This distinction has

far-reaching consequences. Where the obligation survives but the action is prescribed,

the surviving obligation has other utilities such as the possibility to be the basis of set off

or compensatio which is not possible where the obligation is extinguished.

The point to be considered is what form of extinctive prescription is contained in sections

5 to 10 of the Prescription Ordinance. Before examining this point, I would like to examine

briefly the situation under Roman Dutch law, which is our common law.

Lee traces the introduction of extinctive prescription in Roman Law to an enactment of

Theodosius II (A.D. 424) whereby actions, in the absence of any other provisions in law,

were barred by the lapse of thirty and in some cases forty years. No substantive rights

were extinguished [Lee, The Elements of Roman Law, Sweet & Maxwell Limited, London,

4th Ed. (1956), page 125]. Grotious takes the view that in Roman Law, obligations are not

extinguished by time and that a bar only is afforded against them, whilst Roman Dutch

Law recognized both forms of extinctive prescription [See The Introduction to Dutch

Jurisprudence of Hugo Grotious, Charles Herbert, John Van Voorst, Paternoster Row,

London, 1844, page 469]. Voet is of the opinion that the effect of prescription is not ipso

jure to destroy the obligation itself [Weeramantry, The Law of Contracts, Vol. II, p. 766].

Page 9 of 17

However, in Terunnanse v. Menike (1 N.L.R. 200 at 202) it was held that the Prescription

Ordinance and the previous Ordinance No. 8 of 1834, kept alive the repeal by Regulation

No. 13 of 1822 of "all laws heretofore enacted or customs existing " with respect to the

acquiring of rights and the barring of civil "actions by prescription," and that the

consequence of that Regulation and those Ordinances was to sweep away all the Roman-

Dutch Law relating to the acquisition of title in immovable property (including positive

and negative servitudes) by prescription, except as regards the property of the Crown.

Any doubt as to the applicability of extinctive prescription under Roman Dutch Law was

cleared in Dabare v. Martelis Appu (5 N.L.R. 210 at 215) where it was held that the

limitation of actions under the Common Law was completely abrogated, first by the

Proclamation of 1801 and then by Ordinance No. 8 of 1834. The sweeping away of the

whole of Roman Dutch Law on both acquisitive and extinctive prescription was confirmed

by the Privy Council in Corea v. Appuhamy (15 N.L.R. 65 at 77) where it was held that the

whole law of limitation is now contained in the Prescription Ordinance.

The question then arises whether there is any utility of decisions of English Courts in

interpreting the Prescription Ordinance. In Emanis v. Sadappu (2 N.L.R. 261 at 269)

Withers J. denied any such use and held that the Prescription Ordinance should be

construed by its own language. Weeramantry (The Law of Contracts, Vol. II, page 777)

appears to agree with this position in stating that resort should not be had to the

principles of English law in construing the sections of the Prescription Ordinance. The only

exception identified therein is where resort will be made to English law in those branches

of our law governed by it, but that too merely to determine the time of accrual of the

cause of action and no more. However, Weeramantry (supra. at p. 803) states that English

decisions under Lord Tenterdens Act may be relied upon to aid in the interpretation of

the Prescription Ordinance.

Moreover, Weeramantry (supra. page 800) takes the view that an acknowledgment or

promise to pay a statute barred debt is valid and may be sued upon, whether the debt in

question be one governed by English or Roman Dutch Law. In support of this proposition

the decisions of Philips v. Philips [(1844) 3 Hare 281], Spencer v. Hemmerde [(1922) 2 A.C.

507 (HL)], Hoare & Co. v. Rajaratnam (34 N.L.R. 219 at 224) and Mohideen Saibo v.

Page 10 of 17

Walters [(1887) 8 S.C.C. 99] are cited. This statement appears to be a validation of the

proposition found in some decisions of English Courts that the theoretical basis of an

acknowledgment of a statute barred debt is a fresh obligation and not merely as an

extension of the limitation period and hence the action must be based on the

acknowledgment and not the statute barred debt.

Accordingly, I must out of the greatest of respect to the great judge and jurist, examine

closely the position in English Law on limitation in general and acknowledgment in

particular and its impact on the debt.

This examination must first recognize that English statutory law recognizes both

acquisitive prescription (sections 3 and 17 of the Limitation Act 1980) and extinctive

prescription. The point to be considered is what form of extinctive prescription English

Law adopted.

The Limitation Act, 1623 did not recognize that an acknowledgment of a debt stopped the

running of time. As far as this Act was concerned, nothing would allow simple contractual

debts to be recovered after six years.

The doctrine of acknowledgment was developed by judges to mitigate the rigors of the

Act. Thus, where the debtor acknowledges the debt or made a part payment, it was held

that in the interests of justice the debtor will no longer be able to invoke the Limitation

Act, 1623. Yet opinion was divided on the theoretical basis of that doctrine. Some judges

took the view that the acknowledgment must also imply a promise to pay the debt and

arguably therefore the plaintiff must sue on the fresh promise and not the old debt [See

Tanner v. Smart (6 B. & C. 603)]. This line of authority was given statutory recognition in

Lord Tenterdens Act 1828 and Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856.

Page 11 of 17

The first English case cited by Weeramantry in support of the proposition that an

acknowledgment of a debt barred by statute may be sued upon is Philips v. Philips (supra.

at p. 299) where Wigram V.C. held as follows:

The legal effect of an acknowledgment of a debt barred by the Statute of

Limitations is that of a promise to pay the old debt, and for this purpose the old

debt is a consideration in law. In that sense, and for that purpose, the old debt may

be said to be revived. It is revived as a consideration for a new promise. But the new

promise, and not the old debt, is the measure of the creditors rights.

This reasoning was adopted in Arunasalem v. Ramasamy (17 N.L.R. 156), Walker Sons &

Co., Ltd. v. Kandyah (21 N.L.R. 317 at 319, 320) and Hoare & Co. v. Rajaratnam (supra).

De Sampayo A.J. in Arunasalam v. Ramasamy (supra) adopting this reasoning held that a

payment on account amounts to an acknowledgement of the debt which implies a

promise to pay the balance and that the implied promise creates a new obligation.

However, Mosely S.P.J. in Udumanchy v. Meeralevve (43 N.L.R. 59) after considering

Arunasalam v. Ramasamy (supra) held that the payment on account made in that case,

cannot be regarded as creating a new cause of action but it merely extended the period

of prescription. He adopted the reasoning of Lord Sumner in Spencer v. Hemmerde

(supra), an authority on which Weeramantry bases his support for the proposal that

acknowledgment of a debt creates a new obligation.

In Spencer v. Hemmerde (supra), Lord Sumner made an exhaustive examination of the

legal position in England on prescription and acknowledgement, including Philips v.

Philips (supra). He went on to hold (at 524-525):

I find that the great preponderance of the cases is against regarding the new

promise as a new cause of action, and it seems to me that reason also is against it.

Surely the real view is, that the promise, which is inferred from the

acknowledgement and continues or renews or establishes the original

promise laid in the declaration, is one which corresponds with and is not a variance

from or in contradiction of that promiseIf so, there is no question of any fresh

cause of action

Page 12 of 17

Lord Sumner held (at page 533) that the implication of a promise, which is fixed as a test

in Tanner v. Smart (supra) is rather the mode of determining the character of the

acknowledgment than the basis in itself of the debtors revived liability. He concludes (at

p. 534) that the new promise revives the old debt, but does not create a new one; it revives

it, however, not simpliciter, but subject to any conditions attached to the words, which

operates the revival.

In fact, Farwell L.J. in Re Lacey [(1907) 1 Ch. 330 at 345] described acknowledgment as the

withdrawal by virtue of the Statute of the abrogation of the remedy which leaves the old

debt still recoverable at law. Lightwood in The Time Limit on Actions (Butterworth & Co.,

1909, page 209) states:

The Limitation Act 1623, and the Civil Procedure Act, 1833, do not extinguish the

debt, but only bar the remedy. Hence, though the debt cannot be recovered by

action if the debtor pleads the statute, nevertheless it remains an existing debt

(Wainford v. Barker (1697), 1 Ld. Raym. 232), and can be made available whenever

the creditor has it in his power to set it up without resorting to an action.

In Busch v. Stevens [(1962) 1 All E.R. 412 at 415] Lawton J. held that the statement of Lord

Sumner in Spencer v. Hemmerde (supra) was the correct view prior to the Limitation Act

1939. In fact, as far back as 1889, Cotton L.J. in Curwen v. Milburn [(1889) 42 Ch. D. 424

at 434] held that Statute-barred debts are due although payment of them cannot be

enforced by action. More recently, in Royal Norwegian Government v. Constant &

Constant and Calcutta Marine Engineering Company Ltd [(1960) 2 Lloyds List Law Rep

431 at 442] Lord Diplock held that in English law, subject to a few statutory exceptions,

the expiry of the limitation period bars the claimants remedy, but does not extinguish the

claimants right. He in fact referred to it as elementary law.

Page 13 of 17

Accordingly, I am inclined to accept that, according to English Law, during the relevant

period, the limitation period did not extinguish the debt, but only barred the right of

action. Upon an acknowledgment of the debt been made by the debtor, to use the

colourful words of Lawton J. in Busch v. Stevens (supra. at page 415), the right of action

is given a notional birthday and, on that day, like the phoenix of fable, it rises again in

renewed youth-and also like the phoenix, it is still itself.

I will now examine the provisions of the Prescription Ordinance to determine what form

of extinctive prescription it recognizes.

Sections 5 to 10 of the Prescription Ordinance use the common phrase no action shall be

maintainable. This is a clear indication, in my view, that these sections are not intended

to extinguish an obligation. On the contrary, it only prevents an action being maintained

on an obligation after the lapse of a specified period. The issue is put beyond doubt by

section 11 of the Prescription Ordinance which reads:

11. No claim in reconvention or by way of set-off shall be allowed or maintainable

in respect of any claim or demand after the right to sue in respect thereof shall be

barred by any of the provisions herein before contained.

The words right to sue in respect thereof in this regard indicates the intention of the

legislature to preserve the obligation and bar only the remedy. The action is barred but

the obligation survives. Accordingly, I hold that the legal effect of sections 5 to 10 of the

Prescription Ordinance is only to bar action on the cause of action and not extinguishment

of the cause of action itself.

This position has been adopted in Moorthipillai v. Sivakaminathapillai (14 N.L.R. 30 at

page 32) where Hutchinson C.J. held:

When the time has expired within which an action to recover a debt is

maintainable, and the debtor afterwards promises in writing to pay the debt or

makes a payment on account of it, the effect of the promise in writing, or of the

payment (from which a promise to pay the balance is inferred), is not to revive a

dead claim, but to take the case out of the operation of the enactments which

prescribe the time within which an action must be brought. That is sufficiently

Page 14 of 17

shown by the passage from Pothier quoted by the Commissioner in his first

judgment. When the debt is prescribed it is not extinguished; the bar must be

opposed by the debtor; it is not supplied by the Judge; and it may be waived by a

renunciation of it by the debtor; and an express promise to pay it (which is now

required by the Ordinance to be in writing), or a part payment, is a renunciation of

the benefit of the prescription. (Pothier on Obligations, p. 3, ch. 8, art. 1.)

(Emphasis added)

Moreover, in Brampy Appuhamy v. Gunasekere (50 N.L.R. 253) it was held that the effect

of sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Prescription Ordinance, is merely to limit the

time in which an action may be brought and not to extinguish the right. Thus, in Ravanna

Mana Eyanna & Co. v. The Commissioner of Income Tax (46 N.L.R. 121) it was held that

a debt, although prescribed, can be still regarded as due to the business within the

meaning of section 10(1)(b) of the Excess Profits Duty Ordinance. Similarly, in Perera v.

Don Manuel (21 N.L.R. 81) it was held that a Proctors lien may be enforced even though

an action might not be brought by reason of section 11 of the Prescription Ordinance.

Further support for this position, if needed, is found in section 46(2)(i) of the Civil

Procedure Code which permits the Court to reject a plaint when it appears from the

statement in the plaint that the action is barred by any positive rule of law.

Therefore, the question formulated by the Appellant is incorrect and the question we

have to consider is if P7 is an acknowledgment of the debt, is the action of the Appellants

set out in the Plaint, taken out from the limitation imposed in terms of Section 8 of the

Prescription Ordinance.

The learned High Court Judge has correctly concluded that the action was brought in

respect of goods sold and delivered which is governed by section 8 of the Prescription

Ordinance. Hence the Appellant should have filed this action within one year from the

date of the accrual of the cause of action. The learned judge of the High Court correctly

concluded that the action should have been instituted no later than January 8, 1999,

whereas the action was instituted on June 1, 2001.

Page 15 of 17

However, the P7 acknowledgement is dated August 21, 2000 and the action was filed

within one year from that date. Nevertheless, the learned counsel for the Respondent

submitted that an acknowledgement of the debt to be effective in terms of section 12 of

the Prescription Ordinance must be made before the expiry of the limitation period and

not thereafter. Hence, he submitted that the acknowledgment in this matter should have

been made on or before January 8, 1999 and not later and as it is not the case, the action

is prescribed.

The learned counsel for the Respondent relied on the decisions in Sampath Bank PLC v.

Kaluarachchi Sasitha Palitha [S.C. Appeal 196/2011, S.C.M. 09.09.2019] and Peoples

Bank v. Lokuge International Garments Ltd. [(2010 B.L.R. 261) SC (CHC) Appeal 13/2001].

The position articulated by the learned Counsel for the Respondent appears to be the

position in the English Limitation Act 1980, for it is provided in section 29(7) that subject

to subsection (6), a current period of limitation may be repeatedly extended under this

section by further acknowledgments or payments, but a right of action, once barred by

this Act, shall not be revived by any subsequent acknowledgment or payment. However,

this has no application in Sri Lanka.

In view of my finding that the Prescription Ordinance merely bars the remedy with lapse

of time and does not extinguish the debt, there is no rational justification to insist that an

acknowledgment must be made before the expiry of the limitation period to be effective.

I hold that an acknowledgment of the debt to be effective for the purposes of section 12

of the Prescription Ordinance need not be made before the expiry of the period of

limitation.

Before leaving this point, I must state that far from making any pronouncement in support

of the contention of the Respondent, J.A.N. De Silva C.J. in Peoples Bank v. Lokuge

International Garments Ltd. (supra) quoted with approval the statement of Weeramantry

(The Law of Contracts, Vol. II, page 803) that an acknowledgment even after the full

limitation period has run, will take the case out of the statute. That statement is based on

Moorthipillai v. Sivakaminathapillai (supra).

Page 16 of 17

Accordingly, I hold that an acknowledgment of the debt made in this matter by P7 is valid

and effective to start time running again although it was made after the action on the

debt was barred by the provisions of the Prescription Ordinance.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that P7 is an acknowledgment of the debt, and the action

of the Appellants set out in the plaint, is taken out from the limitation of time imposed in

terms of Section 8 of the Prescription Ordinance.

Has the Learned Judge erred in holding that the cause of action of the Plaintiff-

Appellants is prescribed in law?

The learned High Court Judge concluded that even if P7 is to be regarded as an

acknowledgment, the action must to fail as the action was not based on P7. No reasons

are given in the judgment as to why the Appellant should have based his action on P7. I

can only surmise that this was on the basis that due to lapse of time the original debt was

extinguished and the effect of P7 is to create a new obligation which then must form the

basis of the action. In fact, the submissions of the learned counsel for the Respondent

appear to be in that direction.

The Appellant has in the plaint pleaded both the two invoices, P2 and P4, forming the

subject matter of the sale of goods transactions as well as the acknowledgment P7. It

appears that P7 was pleaded in order to overcome the application of section 46(2)(i) of

the Civil Procedure Code. A strict view of the rules of pleading may lead to the conclusion

that the action is based on the invoices and not the acknowledgment as only the two

invoices have been attached to the plaint.

Nevertheless, as morefully explained earlier, the lapse of time did not extinguish the

original debt. There is no legal bar for the action to be founded on the old debt. The

Appellants were correct in basing this action on the two invoices P2 and P4 and not on P7.

No doubt P7 has to be pleaded to overcome the limitation period but it cannot certainly

be the basis of a fresh cause of action. The legal effect of P7 is to take away the time bar

to the action. Of course, if P7 only admitted part of the old debt, the Appellants can only

maintain the action for that part and not the total debt. This is because P7 will then

remove the bar on maintaining an action only for the amount acknowledged and no more.

Page 17 of 17

For all the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of the learned Judge of the High

Court dated 12.12.2006 and enter judgment as prayed for in the plaint.
