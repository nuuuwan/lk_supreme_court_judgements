"","has sustained several injuries to his right leg. In total, the JMO had observed"
"","30 injuries on the body of Siripala."
"(19)","It  must  be  noted  however,  that  three  omissions  were  highlighted  in  the"
"","course of the cross examination of Rosalyn to the effect that she had failed"
"","to state or mention that the 7th Accused was armed with an axe. What is"

"(21)","It was argued on behalf of the 7th Accused that, the ‘omissions’ referred to"
