"","facts. The test applicable is whether, it being natural for the person to make"
"","the assertion in question, such person has failed to make the assertion. Such"
"","conduct is prima facie an inconsistency unless cleared by an explanation. It"
"","was submitted that witness Nandasiri could not offer an explanation as to"
"","why he stated that he did not see the attack on the deceased in the police"
"","statement  but  stated  that  he  did  in  fact  witness  the  attack  when  giving"
"","evidence  before  the  High  court.  It  was  further  submitted  that  due  to"
"","Nandasiriâ€™s  personal  relationship  to  the  two  deceased  he  is  an  interested"
"","witness. Given these factors it was submitted that there is a reasonable doubt"
"","about the evidence of Nandasiri and it should not be acted upon."
"(28)","I am of the view that the contradiction referred to, as to whether Nandasiri"
"","had  witnessed  the  incident  or  not,  is  a  vital  one  and  makes  his  entire"
"","testimony unreliable and infirm. Thus, I am of the view that placing reliance"
"","on  such  evidence  is  unsafe  and  should  not  have  been  acted  upon  but"
"","rejected."
"(29)","For the reasons set out above, I answer the question of law referred to in"
"","sub-paragraph  (b)  of  Paragraph  15  of  the  Petition  in  the  affirmative.  As"
"","referred  to  earlier  the  other  question  of  law  on  which  special  leave  was"
"","granted was in respect of the 3rd Accused who is now dead; and hence a"
"","requirement of answering the said question does not arise."
"(30)","The question that needs to be addressed now is, even though the question of"
"","law referred to above was answered in favour of the 7th Accused whether"
"","he would be entitled to an acquittal."
