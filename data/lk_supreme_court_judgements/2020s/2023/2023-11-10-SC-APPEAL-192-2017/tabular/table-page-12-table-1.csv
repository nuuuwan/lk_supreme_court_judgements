"","(25)  Addressing the contradiction referred to above, the Court of Appeal held;"
"","“These omissions are, in my view, vital omissions although the learned trial"
"","j
udge, in his judgment, had concluded that they were not vital. When I"
"","consider the said omission, I feel that Nandasiri had not seen Siripala being"
"","a
t
t
acked. Thus, his evidence with regard to the attack on Siripala cannot be"
"","accepted as true.” Considering the nature of the contradiction and its impact"
"","on Nandasiri’s evidence the conclusion of the Court of Appeal is correct."
"(26)","The  Court  of  Appeal,  however,  having  disbelieved  Nandasiri’s  evidence"
"","before the High Court as to witnessing the attack on Siripala, proceeded to"
"","act on the other parts of his evidence, inter alia, relying on the decision in"
"","Samaraweera v. The Attorney General  (1990)  1  SLR  256.  In  the  case  of"
"","Samaraweera [supra] the verdict of the High Court was challenged before"
"","the Court of Appeal mainly on the ground that the same two witnesses who"
"","had  testified  against  the  2nd  Accused  who  was  acquitted  had  testified"
"","against the 3rd Accused who was found guilty. It was contended that if the"
"","two witnesses were disbelieved as against the 2nd Accused the jury should"
"","not  have  believed  them  regarding  the  3rd  Accused-Appellant,  and  the"
"","maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus should have been applied. Rejecting"
"","the said contention, the Court of Appeal held “The verdict was supportable"
"","i
n
 
t
hat the acquittal of the 2nd Accused could be attributable to the fact that"
"","v
i
carious liability on the basis of common intention could not be imputed"

on the evidence even if the two witnesses were believed.”"
"(27)","The learned President’s Counsel citing, E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy’s ‘The Law"
"","of Evidence’ [Vol II, Book 2, page 753,] emphasized that “a failure to assert"
"","a
 
f
act, when it would have been natural to assert it, amounts in effect to an"
"","assertion of a non-existence of a fact.” Relying further on Coomaraswamy,"
"","it  was  submitted  that  it  is  recumbent  on  the  court  to  decide  whether  a"
