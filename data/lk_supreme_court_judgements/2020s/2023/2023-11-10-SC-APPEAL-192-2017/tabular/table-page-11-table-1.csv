"High Court Judge had failed to consider those omissions, in his judgement"
"[at pg 448 of the brief] the learned High Court Judge had observed that her"
"evidence  is  not  tainted  by  ‘serious  contradictions’  which  goes  to  indicate"
"that he had evaluated her evidence.  Thus, the failure to state that the  7th"
"Accused  was  armed  with  an  axe,  in  my  view  is  not  sufficiently  grave  to"
"discredit Rosalyn. Thus, I cannot find fault with the trial judge on relying"
"on the testimony of Rosalyn."
