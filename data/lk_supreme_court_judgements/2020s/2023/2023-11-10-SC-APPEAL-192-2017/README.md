JUDGEMENT

Aluwihare PC J,

(1) Thirteen accused were indicted before the High Court for the commission

of several offences and the Accused-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant stood

as the 7th Accused before the High Court. Hereinafter, the Accused-

Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant will be referred to as the 7th Accused. The

prosecution alleged that these offences were committed by the 7th Accused

and the others who were indicted with him, along with one Wellage

Sirisena Prabath Kumara and others unknown to the prosecution.

(2) The offences for which the 7th Accused and the others were indicted are as

follows;

Count 1- Being a member of an unlawful assembly with the common object

of causing injuries to Uragaha Siripala, an offence punishable

under Section 140 of the Penal Code.

Count 2- Being a member of the said unlawful Assembly, caused the death

of said Uragaha Siripala, an offence punishable under Section

296 of the Penal Code read with Section 146 of the Penal code.

Count 3- Being a member of the same unlawful assembly, caused the death

of Uragaha Nadeeka Thushara, an offence punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code read with Section 146 of the Penal

code.

Count 4- Being a member of the same unlawful assembly caused mischief

to the house of Chandrawathie, an offence punishable under

5

Section 410 of the Penal Code read with Section 146 of the Penal

code.

Count 5-Being a member of the same unlawful assembly committed

robbery of Rs.75,400/-belonging to Chandrawathie an offence

punishable under Section 380 of the Penal Code read with

Section 146 of the Penal code.

Counts 6,7,8 and 9 were based on the substantive counts referred to in

counts 2 to 5 above, on the basis that the said offences were

committed by the accused in furtherance of a common intention.

[Section 32 of the Penal Code]

(3) The trial before the High Court proceeded in the absence of the 5th Accused

who absconded and the 9th Accused who died during the pendency of the

trial.

(4) At the conclusion of the trial, the 1st, 4th, 10th, 11th, 12th and the 13th Accused

were acquitted on all counts.

(5) The 3rd ,5th, 6th, 7th and the 8th Accused were convicted by the learned trial

judge on counts 1 and 2 on the indictment, namely being a member of an

unlawful assembly and the murder of Uragaha Siripala.

(6) The 3rd and the 5th Accused were also convicted on count 6 of the

indictment, namely, causing the death of Nadeeka Thushara on the basis

that the offence was committed by the said accused in furtherance of a

common intention.

6

(7) The 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th and the 8th Accused appealed against the conviction and

the Court of Appeal by its judgement dated 03.04.2013 affirmed the

convictions of all the accused referred to, save for the 8th Accused. The

appeal of the 8th Accused was abated as he passed away during the

pendency of the appeal.

(8) The 3rd and the 7th Accused moved this court by way of Special leave to

Appeal and leave was granted on the questions of law referred to in sub-

paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 15 of the petition of the Accused,

which are as follows;

(b) Did the learned judges of the Court of Appeal misdirect themselves

when they held that the doctrine of divisibility of credibility does not

apply to the evidence of Sewwa Handi Nanadasiri in the circumstances

of this case and thereby occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

(c) Did the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal misdirect themselves in

rejecting the evidence of the 3rd Accused-Appellant on untenable

grounds.

(9) As the 3rd Accused-Appellant- Petitioner-Appellant is since dead, what is

left to be decided is the legality of the conviction of the 7th Accused. It is to

be observed that the question of law referred to in sub-paragraph (c) of

Paragraph 15, on which Special leave was granted relates to the legality of

the conviction of the 3rd Accused-Appellant who is dead. Hence, answering

the said question would not arise now. As such I shall confine to answering

only the question of law referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of Paragraph 15.

(10) Upon an overall consideration of the submissions made by the learned

Presidents Counsel on behalf of the 7th Accused, it appears that the main

thrust of the argument was that the evidence implicating the 7th Accused is

7

unreliable and cannot be acted upon; as such the prosecution had failed to

establish the offences to satisfy the degree of proof required by law, i.e

beyond reasonable doubt, hence, the conviction cannot stand.

(11) It was also contended that if the evidence was evaluated in the correct

perspective applying the applicable legal principles, no reasonable court

could have come to the conclusion that the 7th Accused was guilty. In the

circumstances, it was argued that both the learned trial judge as well as the

Court of Appeal erred in that respect.

(12) In view of the nature of the legal issue raised on behalf of the 7th Accused,

it would be necessary to consider the totality of the evidence led at the trial

and to consider whether the courts below have properly evaluated the

evidence led at the trial, in particular the material incriminating the 7th

Accused. In this context, I find the background to the incident would be of

utmost relevance.

The Factual Background

(13) According to the evidence led at the trial, it transpired that two incidents

had taken place on the day in question. According to witness Nandasiri, the

two deceased happened to be his brother-in law [Siripala] and his nephew

[Thushara]. They had lived roughly about 100 meters away from his

residence, but the houses are not directly visible to each other. On the

morning of the incident, Nandasiri had learnt that his nephew Thushara

had shot one Shantha. Around mid-day, while he was at his aunts place

which was in close proximity to his house, he had seen a crowd of people

going towards the deceaseds house which was followed by a sound of an

explosion. Then he had returned home.

8

(14) Around the same time, Siripala had come running to Nandasiris residence,

accompanied by his two daughters and son. Siripala had requested

Nandasiri to board the two daughters to a bus saying that a crowd came to

attack them. Nandasiri had dutifully acceded to the request and had taken

the two daughters and seen to it that they boarded a bus. Thereafter

Nandasiri has returned home. In the course of the examination in chief, he

had said that he identified the 2nd Accused, Jayalie as one of the persons who

came that day armed with a knife and he saw the deceased Siripala

grappling with the 2nd Accused. At one point, he says he saw Siripala falling

and at that juncture he witnessed the other Accused including the 7th

Accused surrounding the deceased Siripala and attacking him.

(15) Under cross examination a contradiction was marked as V2, where he had

told the police that he did not see Siripala being attacked [

.] and that due to fear he fled and returned only

after the Police and the Magistrate visited the scene. Although this witness

had not seen as to how Thushara came about his death, he had seen the two

bodies of Siripala and Thushara with multiple injuries. It is also to be noted

that the statement of this witness to the Police is somewhat belated in that,

he had given the statement the day after the incident. There was no mention

in the statement, of him having witnessed the attack on Siripala, which was

highlighted as an omission by the defence.

(16) According to witness Chandravathi who is the wife of the deceased Siripala,

while she was in the Galle town, she was informed about the shooting of

Shantha and she had rushed home. On the way she had been given the news

by one Lucian, that a commotion was taking place near her house. She had

said that, instead of going home, she got off the three-wheeler in which she

was travelling at Lucians house. From there she had walked towards home

and she says she searched for her son Thushara in the vicinity as he was not

9

to be found and when she was finally walking towards the house, she heard

her sister Ruwani, shouting that a crowd from IDH Watte is approaching.

(17) It appears that at this juncture this witness had got separated from her other

family members and having realised that her house was surrounded, she

had fled and had boarded a Matara bound bus. When the bus was passing

in front of her house, she had identified the 7th Accused along with the

several other Accused [the 1st , 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 11th] among the crowd that

had surrounded her house. It was this witness who had made the initial

complaint to the police and had arrived at the crime scene with the Police.

(18) Prosecution witness Rosalyn happened to be the mother-in-law and the

grandmother respectively of Siripala and Thushara, the two deceased.

According to the testimony of witness Rosalyn, the deceased Siripala, had

come running in the direction of their house accompanied by his two

daughters, saying he had heard a commotion from the direction of their

house. After a while a crowd from IDH Watte had come running in their

direction and the 2nd Accused and Siripala had grappled with each other

and others followed by attacking Siripala with knives and clubs. She had

said she saw the 7th Accused attacking the deceased with an axe. She had

also said that the deceased Thushara was hiding under a bed at their

residence and she saw both the 3rd and 4th Accused entering the house

having forced open the door. The witness having specifically referred to the

2nd, 3rd, 5th and the 6th Accused however had said; I do not know the names

of the others but all of them came. [ .] This appears

to be a clear reference to the Accused that was standing in the dock. Then,

the witness had been asked, of the people who came, who are in court and

the response of the witness was All of them were there [

.]. She had said that several Accused attacked Siripala with knives

and in reference to the 7th Accused she had said that he attacked Siripala on

10

his legs with an axe. The Post-Mortem Report of Siripala indicates that he

has sustained several injuries to his right leg. In total, the JMO had observed

30 injuries on the body of Siripala.

(19) It must be noted however, that three omissions were highlighted in the

course of the cross examination of Rosalyn to the effect that she had failed

to state or mention that the 7th Accused was armed with an axe. What is

significant is that the omission relates to the weapon the 7th Accused alleged

to have carried at the time of the attack, but not relating to his presence at

the scene when the crimes were committed. Her statement to the Police does

not appear to be a belated one.

(20) It is also to be noted that other than the omissions referred to above, the

evidence of Rosalyn is devoid of contradiction per se. The learned trial judge

having considered the evidence of Rosalyn had observed that there is no

reason to reject the evidence of the said witness. As the witness had testified

before the predecessor of the learned High Court judge who delivered the

judgement, he had not commented on the demeanour or the deportment of

the witness. Undoubtedly it would have been a traumatic experience for

Rosalyn to witness the attack on her son-in-law and grandchild. Further,

she had mentioned that a crowd of about 25 people came there on that day.

Under those circumstances, it was quite possible that she would not have

been in a fit mental status, not only to absorb every detail of the events that

unfolded on that day but also to narrate them in detail. I am of the view that

the infirmities in Rosalyns testimony must be evaluated considering the

traumatic experience she had to undergo, having witnessed the incident.

(21) It was argued on behalf of the 7th Accused that, the omissions referred to

in the testimony of Rosalyn create a serious doubt about the testimonial

trustworthiness of the witness. Although it was contended that the learned

11

High Court Judge had failed to consider those omissions, in his judgement

[at pg 448 of the brief] the learned High Court Judge had observed that her

evidence is not tainted by serious contradictions which goes to indicate

that he had evaluated her evidence. Thus, the failure to state that the 7th

Accused was armed with an axe, in my view is not sufficiently grave to

discredit Rosalyn. Thus, I cannot find fault with the trial judge on relying

on the testimony of Rosalyn.

(22) On the other hand, in evaluating Rosalyns evidence, the learned trial judge

had considered the evidence given by the police officers who visited the

scene and had observed that her evidence is compatible with observations

made by the police officers [pg 447 of the brief] in the circumstances

aforesaid, the findings of the learned trial judge on the testimonial

trustworthiness of Rosalyn cannot be faulted.

The Questions of Law

(23) The first question that this court is called upon to address is whether the

Learned Judges of the Court of Appeal misdirected themselves when they

held that the doctrine of indivisibility of credibility does not apply to the

evidence of witness Nandasiri in the circumstances of this case and thereby

occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

(24) Giving evidence before the High Court, witness Nandasiri stated that the 8th

Accused hit the diseased Siripala with a pestle which made him fall to a side

and that thereafter the 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Accused surrounded Siripala

and attacked him with weapons (pg 126 of the High Court Brief), seeing

which, he fled the scene. In his statement to the Police, however, he had

stated that he did not see the attack on the deceased Siripala. This

contradiction was marked as 3V1 and 10V3 (pgs 149 and 183 of P1).

12

(25) Addressing the contradiction referred to above, the Court of Appeal held;

These omissions are, in my view, vital omissions although the learned trial

judge, in his judgment, had concluded that they were not vital. When I

consider the said omission, I feel that Nandasiri had not seen Siripala being

attacked. Thus, his evidence with regard to the attack on Siripala cannot be

accepted as true. Considering the nature of the contradiction and its impact

on Nandasiris evidence the conclusion of the Court of Appeal is correct.

(26) The Court of Appeal, however, having disbelieved Nandasiris evidence

before the High Court as to witnessing the attack on Siripala, proceeded to

act on the other parts of his evidence, inter alia, relying on the decision in

Samaraweera v. The Attorney General (1990) 1 SLR 256. In the case of

Samaraweera [supra] the verdict of the High Court was challenged before

the Court of Appeal mainly on the ground that the same two witnesses who

had testified against the 2nd Accused who was acquitted had testified

against the 3rd Accused who was found guilty. It was contended that if the

two witnesses were disbelieved as against the 2nd Accused the jury should

not have believed them regarding the 3rd Accused-Appellant, and the

maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus should have been applied. Rejecting

the said contention, the Court of Appeal held The verdict was supportable

in that the acquittal of the 2nd Accused could be attributable to the fact that

vicarious liability on the basis of common intention could not be imputed

to him on the evidence even if the two witnesses were believed.

(27) The learned Presidents Counsel citing, E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamys The Law

of Evidence [Vol II, Book 2, page 753,] emphasized that a failure to assert

a fact, when it would have been natural to assert it, amounts in effect to an

assertion of a non-existence of a fact. Relying further on Coomaraswamy,

it was submitted that it is recumbent on the court to decide whether a

particular omission amounts to a contradiction or not by reference to the

13

facts. The test applicable is whether, it being natural for the person to make

the assertion in question, such person has failed to make the assertion. Such

conduct is prima facie an inconsistency unless cleared by an explanation. It

was submitted that witness Nandasiri could not offer an explanation as to

why he stated that he did not see the attack on the deceased in the police

statement but stated that he did in fact witness the attack when giving

evidence before the High court. It was further submitted that due to

Nandasiris personal relationship to the two deceased he is an interested

witness. Given these factors it was submitted that there is a reasonable doubt

about the evidence of Nandasiri and it should not be acted upon.

(28) I am of the view that the contradiction referred to, as to whether Nandasiri

had witnessed the incident or not, is a vital one and makes his entire

testimony unreliable and infirm. Thus, I am of the view that placing reliance

on such evidence is unsafe and should not have been acted upon but

rejected.

(29) For the reasons set out above, I answer the question of law referred to in

sub-paragraph (b) of Paragraph 15 of the Petition in the affirmative. As

referred to earlier the other question of law on which special leave was

granted was in respect of the 3rd Accused who is now dead; and hence a

requirement of answering the said question does not arise.

(30) The question that needs to be addressed now is, even though the question of

law referred to above was answered in favour of the 7th Accused whether

he would be entitled to an acquittal.

(31) Although both the learned trial judge as well as the Court of Appeal had

misdirected themselves by not rejecting the evidence of witness Nandasiri,

the same cannot be said about witness Rosalyn. Even if the evidence of

14

witness Nandasiri is rejected, I see no reason to reject the evidence of

Rosalyn and as such the trial judge cannot be faulted for acting on her

evidence. As referred to earlier she had clearly implicated the 7th Accused

as one of the persons who came with the crowd that day and attacked both

Siripala and Thushara, the two deceased.

(32) In the circumstances referred to above, I am of the view that this is a fit case

to apply the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution which reads;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be reversed

or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

Although this court is of the opinion that the question of law raised should

be decided in favour of the 7th Accused-Appellant, I proceed to dismiss this

appeal as no failure of justice has occurred.

Appeal dismissed.
