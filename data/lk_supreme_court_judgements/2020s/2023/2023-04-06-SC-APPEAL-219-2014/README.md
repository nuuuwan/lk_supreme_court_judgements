SC/APPEAL/219/2014

marked P12 issued in terms of section 16 of the Recovery of Loans by

Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990. The Court allowed the

application. The fiscal executed the writ on 05.10.2006. The fiscals

report insofar as relevant for the present purposes reads as follows:

The 2nd and 3rd respondents made an application dated 11.10.2006 in

terms of section 328 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking restoration to

possession. However, this application was not pursued.

6

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

The appellant judgment-creditor made an application dated 18.10.2006

in terms of sections 325 and 326 of the Civil Procedure Code, stating that

although the fiscal had delivered possession to the appellant on

05.10.2006, such possession was not properly delivered as the 1st-4th

respondents namely, (1) Ranjith Lionel Kuruneru, (2) Ranjula Kuruneru,

(3) N.A. Abeydheera, (4) Srimathi Abeysinghe had obstructed the fiscal

from ejecting them from the property. The appellant sought effective

delivery of possession by removing the buildings and ejecting the

respondents from the property.

.

16. 2,3,4 /

.

Then the 1st-4th respondents made an application dated 12.11.2006 in

terms of sections 325 and 326 of the Civil Procedure Code seeking

restoration to possession.

According to the journal entry No. 6 dated 15.11.2006, the appellants

Attorney-at-Law made an application to the District Court to amend the

petition dated 18.10.2006 by adding the judgment-debtor as the 5th

respondent. The respondents did not object to that application and the

Court allowed it. Accordingly, the amended petition dated 06.12.2006

was filed reflecting only that amendment. The 5th respondent did not

come forward to contest the writ of execution.

7

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

The inquiry was held before the learned District Judge and several

witnesses gave evidence. The 1st, 3rd and 4th respondents also gave

evidence. At the time of the execution of the writ, the 1st and 4th

respondents were present. In paragraph 2 of the petition dated

12.11.2006, the 1st and 4th respondents admit that they resisted the fiscal

in the execution of the writ. This is also stated in the fiscals report and

by the 4th respondent in her evidence. There is no dispute that they

resisted but the fiscal executed the writ nonetheless.

After the inquiry, the learned District Judge dismissed the application of

the appellant on two grounds:

(a) The application of the appellant is unclear due to failure to

establish which of the two limbs in section 325(1) of the Civil

Procedure Code the appellant was relying on.

(b) The application of the appellant is time-barred.

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Ratnapura, affirmed the

order of the District Court. Hence this appeal by the judgment-creditor.

Let me now consider the legitimacy of the above two grounds relied on by

the Courts below to dismiss the appellants application.

Was the application of the appellant unclear?

Section 325 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

325. (1) Where in the execution of a decree for the possession of

movable or immovable property the Fiscal is resisted or obstructed

by the judgment-debtor or any other person, or where after the officer

has delivered possession, the judgment-creditor is hindered or

ousted by the judgment-debtor or any other person in taking

complete and effectual possession thereof, and in the case of

immovable property, where the judgment-creditor has been so

8

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

hindered or ousted within a period of one year and one day, the

judgment-creditor may at any time within one month from the date

of such resistance or obstruction or hindrance or ouster, complain

thereof to the court by a petition in which the judgment-debtor and

the person, if any, resisting or obstructing or hindering or ousting

shall be named respondents. The court shall thereupon serve a copy

of such petition on the parties named therein as respondents and

require such respondents to file objections, if any, within such time

as they may be directed by court.

(2) When a petition under subsection (1) is presented, the court may,

upon the application of the judgment-creditor made by motion ex

parte, direct the Fiscal to publish a notice announcing that the Fiscal

has been resisted or obstructed in delivering possession of such

property, or that the judgment-creditor has been hindered in taking

complete and effectual possession thereof or ousted therefrom, as

the case may be, by the judgment-debtor or other person, and calling

upon all persons claiming to be in possession of the whole or any

part of such property by virtue of any right or interest and who object

to possession being delivered to the judgment-creditor to notify their

claims to court within fifteen days of the publication of the notice.

(3) The Fiscal shall make publication by affixing a copy of the notice

in the language of the court, and, where the language of the court is

also Tamil, in that language, in some conspicuous place on the

property and proclaiming in the customary mode or in such manner

as the court may direct, the contents of the notice. A copy of such

notice shall be affixed to the court-house and if the court so orders

shall also be published in any daily newspaper as the court may

direct.

9

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

(4) Any person claiming to be in possession of the whole of the

property or part thereof as against the judgment-creditor may file a

written statement of his claim within fifteen days of the publication

of the notice on such property, setting out his right or interest entitling

him to the present possession of the whole property or part thereof

and shall serve a copy of such statement on the judgment-creditor.

The investigation into such claim shall be taken up along with the

inquiry into the petition in respect of the resistance, obstruction,

hindrance or ouster complained of, after due notice of the date of

such investigation and inquiry has been given to all persons

concerned. Every such investigation and inquiry shall be concluded

within sixty days of the publication of the notice referred to in

subsection (2).

Section 325(1) has two main limbs.

According to section 325(1)

(a) where in the execution of a decree for the possession of immovable

or movable property the fiscal is resisted or obstructed by the

judgment-debtor or any other person, or

(b) where after the fiscal has delivered possession of immovable or

movable property the judgment-creditor is hindered or ousted in

taking complete and effectual possession by the judgment-debtor

or any other person,

the judgment-creditor may at any time within one month from the

date of such resistance or obstruction or hindrance or ouster complain

to the District Court by way of a petition.

Section 325(1) imposes a further restriction in respect of immovable

property, in that, in addition to the one month restriction from the date

of hindrance or ouster, it is required that such hindrance or ouster shall

10

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

also fall within one year and one day from the date of delivery of

possession. This additional condition is inapplicable to movable property.

The learned District Judge held that the appellant judgment-creditor

failed to make clear which of the said two limbs apply to the appellants

application and therefore the appellant did not establish its claim. Is this

conclusion correct and reasonable?

The learned District Judge says that according to the appellants petition,

possession was not delivered but according to the fiscals report,

possession was delivered, and these contradictory positions remain in

obscurity. I beg to differ. The appellant in his petition does not say that

possession was not deliveredvide what I quoted above. The appellants

complaint is that he could not take complete possession of the property.

The first limb of section 325(1) contemplates a situation where the fiscal

is totally prevented from delivering possession to the judgment-creditor

due to resistance or obstruction by the judgment-debtor or any other

person.

Even if there is no resistance, obstruction, hindrance or opposition, if the

property comprises, for instance, a large land with several buildings, the

fiscal cannot traverse the entirety of the land and buildings and

completely and effectually deliver every part of the land and buildings

and every grain of sand to the judgment-creditor. The fiscal can only

effect constructive or symbolic delivery of possession.

The second limb of section 325(1) contemplates two situations after the

fiscal has delivered possession of the property:

(a) where the judgment-creditor has been hindered in taking complete

and effectual possession of the property; or

(b) where the judgment-creditor has been ousted from the property.

11

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

The difference between constructive or symbolic delivery of possession by

the fiscal and hindrance to the judgment-creditor taking complete and

effectual possession after the delivery of possession needs to be clearly

understood.

These two things need not happen at the same time. The District Court

and the High Court failed to appreciate this difference and, hence, fell

into error.

On the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the appellant

satisfactorily established the following before Court:

(a) resistance to the fiscal in the execution of the decree, and

(b) hindrance to the appellant taking complete and effectual

possession.

According to the fiscals report, the fiscal could not give complete and

effectual possession of the property to the judgment-creditor. The

respondents continue to be in possession despite delivery of possession.

The 2nd respondent is carrying on a garage business in a building

constructed on the land.

In my view, on the facts and circumstances of this case, the appellant is

eminently qualified to seek relief under the second limb of section 325(1),

i.e. hindrance by the respondents to the appellant taking complete and

effectual possession of the property after the delivery of possession.

For the aforesaid reasons, the first ground upon which the learned

District Judge rejected the application of the appellant is faulty.

Time bar objection

The next question is whether the application made by the appellant is

time-barred? According to section 325(1), the application has to be filed

12

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

within one month from the date of such resistance or obstruction or

hindrance or ouster. As I stated before, this has a further restriction. That

is, if the application is for the delivery of possession of immovable

property, the application shall be filed by the judgment-creditor within

one year and one day from the date of delivery of possession of the

immovable property.

The learned District Judge says the application was filed by the appellant

in the District Court on 06.12.2006 because the inquiry was held based

on that application. The fiscal executed the writ on 05.10.2006 and the

appellant filed the application on 18.10.2006. There is no dispute that

the original application was filed within one month from the date of

delivery of possession. Thereafter, with the agreement of the respondents

and the permission of Court, an amended petition was filed on

06.12.2006 only to add the name of the judgment-debtor as a party. The

learned District Judge says the amended petition is not within time and

therefore the application is time-barred. I regret my inability to agree.

When pleadings (plaint, answer, petition, statement of objections etc.) are

amended, it is considered for all purposes as relating back to the original

pleadings. Vide Morris v. Dias (1892) 2 CLR 185, Endoris v. Hamine (1895)

3 NLR 97, Lucihamy v. Hamidu (1923) 26 NLR 41, Ordiris Silva & Sons

Ltd v. Jayawardena (1953) 55 NLR 335, Nations Trust Bank PLC v.

Piyathilake (SC/APPEAL/146/2014, SC Minutes of 05.10.2016). The

application shall be taken to have been filed on 18.10.2006.

Hence, the second ground upon which the learned District Judge rejected

the application of the appellant is also unacceptable.

Complexity of execution proceedings

I admit that the provisions pertaining to execution proceedings contained

in the Civil Procedure Code are complex and complicated and the

13

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

judgment-debtors exploit this complexity to deny or at least delay the

decree holder from enjoying the fruits of his victory. These provisions are

mainly found in Chapter XXII of the Civil Procedure Code spanning

sections 217-354. In addition, there are several other sections scattered

across the Code dealing with the execution of decrees. The fact that more

than 150 sections are dedicated to the subject of execution of writ itself

underscores the complexity of the issue. The statutory provisions in this

regard have undergone radical changes over the years. Therefore, the

present provisions of the law cannot be understood solely by relying on

past decisions. With this in mind, in (SC/APPEAL/135/2017, SC

Minutes of 31.03.2023) I dealt with the law relating to delivery of

immovable property in the execution of decrees under section 217(c) in

some detail. Hence I do not wish to repeat the discussion here.

Section 325 inquiry

Inquiries on execution proceedings held in terms of section 325 are not

full-blown trials but summary inquiries to provide speedy and

inexpensive remedies. Such inquiries shall be concluded within 60 days

of the publication of notice on the land allowing any claimants to

intervene.

In the instant case, after the execution of writ, the 2nd and 3rd

respondents first made an application in terms of section 328 of the Civil

Procedure Code and then, together with the 2nd respondents father (the

1st respondent) and the 3rd respondents wife (the 4th respondent), filed

another application in terms of sections 325 and 326 of the Civil

Procedure Code. It was not the appellant decree holder but the

respondents who were uncertain in their applications. In those

applications the respondents pray that they be restored to possession

whilst they are in possession. This is because the fiscal had delivered

constructive possession to the appellant.

14

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

In terms of section 325(1), a copy of the judgment-creditors petition shall

be served on the respondents requiring them to file objections, if any,

within the given time. In terms of section 325(2), upon the application of

the judgment-creditor, the Court can also publish notice on the property,

the Court-house and in a newspaper calling upon all persons to give

notice of their claims and file their statements of claim, if any, to Court

within 15 days of the publication of the notice on the land. The appellant

in this case served notice on the respondents and published notice on

the land and the Court-house. It is in response to such notice that the

respondents filed the written statement of claim dated 12.11.2006. This

is different from filing objections in terms of section 325(1).

Both parties claim to have made their applications under sections 325

and 326. Then it can safely be concluded that the appellant made the

application under section 325(1) and the respondents submitted their

claims under section 325(4).

Section 326 spells out the orders the Court can make after the section

325 inquiry.

326. (1) On the hearing of the matter of the petition and the claim

made, if any, the court, if satisfied-

(a) that the resistance, obstruction, hindrance or ouster

complained of was occasioned by the judgment-debtor or by

some person at his instigation or on his behalf;

(b) that the resistance, obstruction, hindrance or ouster

complained of was occasioned by a person other than the

judgment-debtor, and that the claim of such person to be in

possession of the property, whether on his own account or on

account of some person other than the judgment-debtor, is not in

good faith; or

15

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

(c) that the claim made, if any, has not been established,

shall direct the judgment-creditor to be put into or restored to the

possession of the property and may, in the case specified in

paragraph (a), in addition sentence the judgment-debtor or such

other person to imprisonment for a period not exceeding thirty days.

(3) The court may make such order as to the costs of the application,

the charges and expenses incurred in publishing the notice and the

hearing and the reissue of writ as the court shall deem meet.

After the inquiry, the Court shall, if satisfied, direct the judgment-creditor

to be put into or restored to (as the case may be) possession of the

property.

Who shall prove what at the inquiry?

In general, what is required to be investigated at the inquiry in terms of

section 325 are the claims of persons other than the judgment-debtor

purportedly in possession of the land. The decree holders right to have

the decree executed arises from his decree and the burden is on the

claimant to support his claim as against that decree. Although the right

to commence the section 325 inquiry lies with the judgment-creditor as

the petitioner, he cannot be expected to prove the negative.

In terms of section 327, if the resistance, obstruction, hindrance or

ouster is by a person in possession in good faith independent of the

judgment-debtor by virtue of any right or interest which has been

established, the Court shall dismiss the petition of the judgment-creditor.

Section 327 is connected to section 326. Section 326 deals with how the

judgment-creditors application can be allowed whereas section 327 deals

with how his application can be dismissed confirming the possession of

the claimant. Section 327 reads as follows:

16

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

327. Where the resistance, obstruction, hindrance or ouster is found

by court to have been occasioned by any person other than the

judgment-debtor, claiming in good faith to be in possession of the

whole of such property on his own account or on account of some

person other than the judgment-debtor by virtue of any right or

interest, or where the claim notified is found by the court to have

been made by a person claiming to be in possession of the whole of

such property on his own account or on account of some person other

than the judgment-debtor, by virtue of any right or interest, the court

shall make order dismissing the petition, if it finds that such right or

interest has been established.

When sections 325, 326 and 327 are read together it is clear that the

judgment-debtor has no defence (subject to exceptions such as that he

has already satisfied the decree), and the person other than the

judgment-debtor shall prove to the satisfaction of the Court that, firstly,

he is in possession and, secondly, he is in such possession in good faith

and on his own account or on account of some person other than the

judgment-debtor by virtue of any right or interest. This is more than mere

proof of possession but less than proof of title. Since the inquiry shall be

concluded within 60 days of the publication of notice on the property in

terms of section 325(4), full investigation of title is neither required nor

possible. However the Court should know the standing of such persons

in order to make a suitable order in terms of section 326, also allowing

the dissatisfied party to institute action to establish his right or title to

such property in terms of section 329.

If the resistance, obstruction, hindrance or ouster was occasioned by the

judgment-debtor or by another at his instigation, the Court may sentence

the judgment-debtor or such other person for a period not exceeding

thirty days. This is different from a contempt of court charge

17

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

contemplated in section 330 of the Civil Procedure Code in terms of

chapter 65 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Hence the view of both the District Court and the High Court that there

is no burden cast upon the respondents to prove their claim until the

initial burden is discharged by the appellant judgment-creditor by

proving his application made under section 325(1), is misconceived in

law.

Judgment-creditor should not be unnecessarily harassed

In my view, the District Court and the High Court placed an

unnecessarily heavy burden on the appellant.

It must be understood that the petitioner is the decree holder or the

judgment-creditor and, by virtue of the decree in his favour, he has every

right to have it executed. Execution proceedings shall not be converted

to a second trial. The Court shall not discourage the judgment-creditor

from having the decree executed by imposing unnecessary fetters.

Instead, the Court shall facilitate the judgment-creditor reaping the fruits

of his hard-earned victory. What is necessary is not the mere execution

of the decree but the enforcement of the decree. What is the use of having

a decree on a piece of paper if the decree holder cannot translate it into

reality? Justice should be real, not illusory.

No technical objections

In execution proceedings, there is no room for technical objections. In

such proceedings the Court shall look at substance over form. The Court

shall interfere with the execution only if substantial or material prejudice

has been caused to a party or a claimant by any lapse on the part of the

Court or the judgment-creditor resulting in a grave miscarriage of justice.

18

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

In Brooke Bond (Ceylon) Ltd v. Gunasekara [1990] 1 Sri LR 71 at 81, it

was observed that the provisions relating to execution proceedings

should not be construed in such a way as to lightly interfere with the

decree-holders right to reap the fruits of his victory as expeditiously as

possible.

In Ekanayake v. Ekanayake [2003] 2 Sri LR 221 at 227, Amaratunga J.

held:

Execution is a process for the enforcement of a decreed right, mere

technicalities shall not be allowed to impede the enforcement of such

rights in the absence of any prejudice to the judgment debtor.

In Nanayakkara v. Sulaiman (1926) 28 NLR 314 at 315 Dalton J. stated:

As observed by the Privy Council in Bissesur Lall Sahoo v.

Maharajah Luckmessur Singh (6 Indian Appeals 233) in execution

proceedings, the Court will look at the substance of the transaction,

and will not be disposed to set aside an execution upon merely

technical grounds, when the execution has been found to be

substantially right.

This view was emphatically endorsed in an array of decisions including

Wijewardene v. Raymond (1937) 39 NLR 179 at 181 per Soertsz J., Latiff

v. Seneviratne (1938) 40 NLR 141 at 142 per Hearne J., Wijetunga v.

Singham Bros. & Co. (1964) 69 NLR 545 at 546 per Sri Skanda Rajah J.

In Samad v. Zain (1977) 79(2) NLR 557, the plaintiff made five

applications for the execution of writ. He died while the fifth was pending.

The substituted judgment-creditor filed the sixth application for writ,

which was refused on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to exercise

due diligence to procure execution in the previous attempts (due

diligence was a requirement under section 377 before the amendment

19

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

introduced by Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Act No. 53 of 1980).

Whilst setting aside the order of the District Court on the basis that

section 337 should not be construed too strictly against the judgment-

creditor, Wanasundera J. with the concurrence of Tennekoon C.J. and

Rajaratnam J. stated at 563:

The Supreme Court has always been disposed to overlook

technicalities in dealing with execution proceedings. Hearne, J. in

Latiff vs. Seneviratne quoted the words of the Privy Council to the

effect that-

In execution proceedings, the Court will look at the substance of the

transaction, and will not be disposed to set aside an execution upon

merely technical grounds, when the execution has been found to be

substantially right.

We would be interpreting the relevant provisions unduly harshly if

we were to deny the appellant relief in the circumstances of this

case. I would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs both here and

below. The petitioner would be entitled to take out writ of execution

with a view to obtaining satisfaction of the decree of which he is the

assignee.

In Dharmawansa v. Peoples Bank and Another [2006] 3 Sri LR 45, the

Court of Appeal quoted Samad v. Zain to interpret the provisions

pertaining to execution proceedings broadly.

In Leechman & Co. Ltd. v. Rangalla Consolidated Ltd. [1981] 2 Sri LR 373

it was held It is the Fiscal who must sign the prohibitory notice but even

if the Registrar signs it the validity of the notice will not be affected where

the Registrar and the Fiscal are one and the same person. Nor will the

notice be bad because it was addressed to the Chairman, Land Reform

Commission when it should have been addressed to the Land Reform

20

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

Commission because no prejudice was caused and the objection was not

taken at the earliest opportunity. Soza J. declared at page 380:

In the case of Nanayakkara v. Sulaiman (1926) 28 NLR 314 it was

held that in execution proceedings the Court will look at the

substance of the transaction and will not be disposed to interfere on

technical grounds. Especially where no objection has been taken at

the earliest possible opportunity technicalities will be allowed only

very exceptionally to prevail in execution proceedings. Accordingly

all preliminary steps up to the stage of the garnishee proceedings

under section 230 of the Civil Procedure Code must be held to have

been duly complied with.

Vide also the judgment of De Sampayo J. in Suppramanium Chetty v.

Jayawardene (1922) 24 NLR 50 and the separate judgments of Sirimane

J. and Alles J. in Perera v. Thillairajah (1966) 69 NLR 237.

Respondents claim not proved

The next question is whether the respondents established their claim to

the satisfaction of the Court. In my judgment, they did not.

The 3rd and 4th respondents (husband and wife) gave evidence at the

inquiry and attempted to prove that they have title to the land. They do

not have any title deed or permit or grant to this land. Their evidence was

that the 3rd respondent had a deed of declaration marked 4V7 prepared

on 06.04.2004 based on their possession. The 1st respondent in his

evidence states at one point that he is in possession on behalf of the 3rd

respondent and at another point that he is in possession with the

permission of the 3rd respondent. He also did not produce any title deed

executed in his name. However, he has transferred a portion of the land

by deed No. 7147 to his son (the 2nd respondent) on 02.11.2005.

21

SC/APPEAL/219/2014

The land was sold by parate auction on 03.12.2005. Before the sale took

place, notice was served on the 5th respondent judgment-debtor and

publicity of the sale was given by various means, as required by the

Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act. The modus operandi

of the respondents is clear: they have no right or title or interest known

to law to the land and have created a fake title to the land preventing the

judgment-creditor from taking possession.

Conclusion

The questions of law upon which leave to appeal was granted and the

answers thereto are as follows:

Q: Did the High Court misdirect itself in not taking into

consideration the failure of the District Court to make an order in

respect of the claim made by the respondents under section 325(4)

of the Civil Procedure Code when section 325(4) requires the Court

to take both applications made by the judgment creditor and the

respondents together?

A: Yes.

Q: Did the High Court err in failing to take into consideration the

failure of the District Court to make an order under section

326(1)(c), when undisputedly the respondents failed to establish

their claim made under section 325(4) of the Civil Procedure Code?

A: Yes.

Q: Did the High Court misdirect itself by its failure to consider that

the learned District Judge has not properly considered the evidence

before Court that the Fiscal was hindered in taking complete and

effectual possession thereof within the meaning of section 325(2)

of the Civil Procedure Code to deliver possession of the property to

the judgement creditor due to the obstructions made by the

judgement debtor and/or the representatives?

A: It was not the fiscal who was hindered in taking complete and

effectual possession but the judgment-creditor.

Q: Did the High Court misdirect itself by not observing that the

learned District Judge has not properly considered the evidence

given by witness Ananda Thogadeniya, Manager Loans of the

petitioner Bank which shows that the petitioner Bank has not been

able to obtain possession due to the obstruction and resistance of

the respondents?

A: Yes.

Q: Did the High Court err in failing to consider the error made by

the learned District Judge to the effect that the petitioner failed to

establish its claim when the evidence and the conduct of the

respondent demonstrate that the petitioner has established its

case?

A: Yes.

I set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court dated 04.04.2013

and the order of the District Court dated 15.12.2010 and allow the

appeal. The District Court shall direct the fiscal to deliver to the appellant

complete and effectual possession of the property described in the

schedule to the amended petition dated 06.12.2006. The appellant is

entitled to recover costs in all three Courts from the 1st-4th respondents

jointly and severally.
