"Court in terms of section14(2) of the Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999 read with section 9 of Act"
"no. 19 of 1990 but with leave granted by the High Court, it was held;"
"“The present Appeal is neither with special leave from the Supreme Court nor with leave of the"
"Court of Appeal but with leave from the High Court. Therefore, the instant appeal clearly falls into"
"the category of other appeals and hence rules in Part 1C dealing with other appeals would apply."
"The position of the Appellant that there are no rules governing appeals from the Provincial High"
"Court to the Supreme Court is therefore incorrect."
"An appeal to the Supreme Court from an order of the Provincial High Court can be either with the"
"leave of the Provincial High Court or with special leave obtained from the Supreme Court upon a"
"refusal of leave by the High Court."
"If  the  appeal  is  with  leave  of  the  High  Court,  then  Supreme  Court  rules  under  Part  1C  (other"
"appeals) shall apply; If the appeal is with special leave of the Supreme Court, then Supreme Court"
"rules under Part 1A (special leave to appeal) shall apply mutatis mutandis since Rule 2 relates to"
"every application for special leave to appeal…”"
"As per the afore quoted paragraph, when the High Court grants leave, rules in Part 1C apply and"
"if  the  High  Court  refuses  leave,  rules  in  Part  1A  apply.    It  must  be  noted  that  the  ‘deeming"
"provisions’  relied  upon  by  the  Applicant  Respondent  in  raising  the  preliminary  objection  are"
"found in Part IB of the Supreme Court Rules which applies to the appeals where leave to appeal"
"to the Supreme Court is first sought in the Court of Appeal, and that Part has no application to"
"the present application which emanates from the High Court. However, the said decision does"
"not  find  any  issue with filing  an application  in terms  of  section  14(2)  in  combination with  the"
"provisions in section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990."
"Anyway, as per the said decision, rules in Part IA apply and, as per Rule 7, the time limit to file an"
"application is 6 weeks (42 days)."
"As  said  before,  Rule  20(2)  and  Rule  22(5)  of  the  Supreme  Court  Rules  that  contain  ‘deeming"
"provisions’ occur in Part 1B which expressly and specifically deal with appeals from the Court of"
"Appeal where leave to appeal is first sought in the Court of Appeal."
"The learned counsel for the Respondent-Petitioner in his written submissions has brought this"
"Court’s attention to the fact that even though Sections 5 and 7 of the Act No.19 of 1990 have"
"made  written  laws  including  rules  applicable  to  the  appeals  from  Magistrates  Court,  Primary"
"Courts and Labour Tribunals filed in the Provincial High Courts and to the writ applications filed"
"in the Provincial High Court respectively, there are no such specific statutory provisions that make"
"Supreme  Court  Rules  relevant  to  the  Appeals  from  Court  of  Appeal  to  the  Supreme  Court"
"applicable to the Appeals from the Provincial High Court to the Supreme Court."
