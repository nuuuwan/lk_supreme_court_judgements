"“in determining the time for an aggrieved party to lodge an application for special leave to the"
"Supreme Court where no time is fixed either in statutes or the rules; this Court has in the case of"
"Tea Small Holders Ltd v Weragoda1 and in the case of Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka v United"
"Agency  Corporation  (Pvt)  Ltd 2 held  that  the  petitioner  should  make  his  application  within  a"
"reasonable time, and relying on the time period prescribed in the rules for similar applications has"
"held that 42 days is reasonable time.”"
"Thus, in the matter at hand, irrespective of whether Part 1A or 1C apply, the application should"
"have filed within 42 days from the refusal by the High Court to grant leave to appeal which was"
"done on 09.12.2021. This application has been filed on 20.01.2022, thus within 42 days."
"Therefore, the preliminary  objection raised  by  the  Applicant-Respondent is  overruled  and the"
"application is fixed for support for special leave to appeal."
