Judgement

Aluwihare PC. J,

The central question of this appeal is the validity of a deed of gift executed in favour

of the 1st Defendant-Respondent by the donor, C.H. Weerasinghe. The Plaintiffs

4

argument was that C.H. Weerasinghe did not have the capacity to execute the deed

of gift in issue, as he was a person of unsound mind and moved that the District

Court declare the same null and void. The Defendants case on the other hand was

that Weerasinghe had recovered from his illness and that he was in a good state of

mind when he executed the impugned deed.

In concurrent findings, both the District Court as well as the Court of Appeal held

that the impugned deed of gift is void. The present appeal is against the said

findings. This Court granted leave to appeal in this matter on seven questions of

law which are referred to in paragraph (15) of this judgement.

Factual background

(1) The original Plaintiffs Gothamadattawa Weerasinghe (now deceased)

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Plaintiff) and Vijitha

Weerasinghe (now deceased) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 2nd

Plaintiff) are the widow and son respectively of one Charles Hector

Weerasinghe (now deceased) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as C.H.

Weerasinghe).

(2) The property in suit called Meegahawatta alias Ambagahawatta had

been gifted to C.H. Weerasinghe by the original owners, Don Martinus

Perera Weerasinghe and Dona Justina Peternella by Deed No. 217 dated

17th August 1917.

(3) In Case No. 2221/LG, the District Court of Colombo, on the basis that said

C.H. Weerasinghe, [the purported donor of the gift referred to above], was

a person of unsound mind, appointed the 1st Plaintiffs wife as the Manager

of his estate until he was of sound mind and understanding, as evidenced

by the certified copies of the certificate of management dated 18th

September 1929, marked P2 (at page 568 of the Brief) and the security

bond marked P3 (at page 570 of the Brief). This fact had not been disputed

by the Defendants.

5

(4) C.H. Weerasinghe received treatment as an in-house patient at the Angoda

Mental Hospital, and according to the 2nd Plaintiffs testimony (vide pages

416-417 of the Brief) he had been in the hospital for a period of 31 years,

i.e., from 1933 and was discharged in 1964.

(5) After being released from the hospital, C.H. Weerasinghe had resided at the

house of one O.J. Jayawardena, a male nurse who was attached to the

Angoda Mental Hospital, up to his death, in 1977.

(6) While C.H. Weerasinghe was living with O.J. Jayawardena, he had gifted

the property in suit to Eron Singho, the 1st Defendant-Respondent

[hereinafter the 1st Defendant] by Deed No. 41 dated 2nd July 1977. C.H.

Weerasinghe died the following month, on 24th August 1977 at the age of

87, leaving the Plaintiffs as his heirs. His estate was administered in D.C.

Colombo case No. 1963 wherein the 1st Plaintiff was appointed as the

administratrix of his estate.

(7) Following C.H. Weerasinghes death, Eron Singo, the 1st Defendant, by

execution of a Conditional Transfer No. 20390 dated 11th December 1978,

had obtained a sum of Rs. 4000/- from one Lionel Ranasinghe. Having

discharged the said Conditional Transfer by Deed No. 21524, the 1st

Defendant transferred the said property to Rajakaruna, the 2nd Defendant-

Appellant, for a sum of Rupees 30,000/- by Deed No. 21525 dated 4th

March 1980.

(8) The Plaintiffs assert that C.H. Weerasinghe had transferred the property in

suit to the 1st Defendant without the sanction of the Court or of his

guardian while he was insane, thus making Deed No. 41 null and void.

Therefore, it was argued that Deed No. 21525 by which 1st Defendant

transferred the impugned property to Rajakaruna, is also void as no title

passed to Eron Singo, the 1st Defendant.

6

Action Before the District Court

(9) The 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Respondents instituted this action in the District

Court of Panadura against the 1st Defendant [Eron Singo] and the 2nd

Defendant [Rajakaruna], praying inter alia;

1. For a declaration of title to the property more fully described in the

Schedule to the Plaint.

2. A Declaration that Deeds No. 41 and No. 21525 are null and void.

3. An interim and/or permanent injunction restraining the Defendants

from entering the said property.

(10) The District Court dismissed the action of the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs. The

Plaintiff-Respondents appealed against the said judgment in Case No.

85/87(F) and on 15th February 1990, the Court of Appeal set aside the

judgment of the District Court and directed the District Court to hold a trial

de novo.

(11) The second trial commenced under the same case number in 1991 and at

the conclusion of the trial, by his judgement dated 31.01.1997, the learned

District judge held that both Deeds, i.e., No. 41 and No. 21525 were invalid.

(12) Aggrieved by the said judgment the 1st Defendant and 2nd Defendant-

Appellant preferred appeals to the Court of Appeal. [CA Case No.

509A/97(F) and CA Case No. 509/97(F) respectively].

(13) Both appeals were consolidated and taken up for hearing and the Court of

Appeal by its judgment dated 17th June 2016 dismissed the Appeals.

(15) Being aggrieved by the Judgment of the Court of Appeal, the 2nd Defendant-

Appellant preferred a leave to appeal application to this Court and Leave to

Appeal was granted on the following questions of law, set out in

7

paragraphs 19 (i), (iv), (v), (viii) and (ix) of the Petition which are

reproduced verbatim below;

i. Did the Court of Appeal err in law by not taking into consideration that

at the time of the execution of Deed No. 41 by Hector Weerasinghe, he

was quite capable of managing his affairs as reflected by the

uncontroverted evidence adduced at the trial in respect of his mental

capacity?

iv. Was the Court of Appeal in error by not taking into cognizance that the

2nd Defendant being a bona fide purchaser was not bound to make

application in terms of Section 578 of the Civil Procedure Code for a

declaration that the said Weerasinghe was of sound mind prior to the

execution of Deed No. 21525 by the 1st Defendant?

v. Whether our law prohibits a person who has been declared a person of

unsound mind by a competent Court to enter into a contract when such

a person was fully conscious and aware of what he intended to do and

capable of understanding the transaction?

viii. Did the Courts below err in law by the conclusion that the

presumption of lunacy created by the Court Order was in operation

as the Defendants had not taken steps under Section 578?

ix. Did the Court below misdirect in law by insisting on a higher degree of

proof which is not required by the Roman-Dutch Law?

The learned Counsel for the Substituted 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent-

Respondents raised the following questions of law;

1.Has the Defendant formulated issue No. 12 based on the fact that C.H.

Weerasinghe executed deed No. 41 during the lucid interval.

2. If so, that the Defendant admits that the deed was executed between the

space of time between two fits of insanity either the Lucid interval to be

proved by competent medical evidence as the Defendant failed to do so?

8

The position of the 2nd Defendant-Appellant

(16) The learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the 2nd Defendant contended

that C.H. Weerasinghe was of sound mind when he executed the Deed

No.41 and that ample evidence had been led in the District Court to

substantiate that position.

(17) The 2nd Defendant primarily relied on the testimonies of the 1st Defendant

and witnesses, O.J. Jayawardena and Notary Public Chandrapala Hettige,

to establish that after being discharged, C.H. Weerasinghe had led a normal

life, regained full sanity and Deed No. 41 had been executed by him while

he was fully conscious and had the mental capacity to understand the

nature of the transaction, i.e., the execution of the deed no 41.

(18) The position of the 2nd Defendant was that, when C.H. Weerasinghe was

discharged from the Angoda Mental Hospital in 1964, he had fully

recovered from his mental illness according to expert medical opinion of

the specialist doctors at the hospital. He also sought to prove that C.H.

Weerasinghe was of sound mind through the testimony of O.J.

Jayawardena, a male nurse who had worked at the said Mental Hospital

with whom C.H. Weerasinghe had spent the final 13 years of his life after

he was released from the hospital.

(19) Giving evidence at the trial, O.J. Jayawardena stated that he was a senior

nursing officer who was attached to the Angoda Mental Hospital and that

he had special knowledge of nursing mental patients. The witness had

further stated that he had become acquainted with C.H. Weerasinghe while

he was receiving treatment at the Mental Hospital. He observed that C.H.

Weerasinghe possessed a sound knowledge of English and of Shakespeare

and that during one of their light-hearted conversations he had expressed

his desire to leave the hospital and Weerasinghe had requested the witness

to keep him with the witness as his wife and son, [the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs],

did not want to take him back on account of their social status. Having

informed the 1st Plaintiff and having obtained permission from the doctors,

the witness stated that C.H. Weerasinghe was discharged and taken to the

witness home where he remained for 13 years till his death. When

9

questioned as to why C. H. Weerasinghe had been lodged in his house, the

witness stated that it was at the requests made by C.H. Weerasinghe and

the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs. Jayawardena said that after C.H. Weerasinghe was

brought to his place, the 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs visited him once every two to

three months and the witness was paid for Weerasinghes upkeep.

(20) O.J. Jayawardena, testified to the effect that he would never have taken the

risk of accommodating C.H. Weerasinghe at his residence where he lived

with his spouse and children, if he had been mentally unsound. According

to him, C.H. Weerasinghe did not exhibit abnormal behaviour during his

13 year-stay at his residence. On the contrary, the witness claimed that

C.H. Weerasinghe gave English tuition to children in the neighborhood,

accompanied his children to school, bought items needed for the

household, went out alone, attended cricket matches and occasionally

enjoyed an alcoholic drink and a cigarette. These items of evidence, the 2nd

Defendant claims, establish that he was quite sane, had regained his

natural state of mind and lived a very productive life for a person of his

age.

(21) In order to substantiate the assertion that C.H. Weerasinghe was of sound

mind, memory and understanding at the time of execution of Deed No. 41,

reference was made to the evidence of the Notary, Chandrapala Hettige

who executed the deed. He had testified to the effect that when C.H.

Weerasinghe visited him to give instructions regarding the drafting of the

deed, he appeared to be of sound mind and that he did not have any doubts

regarding his mental state.

(22) To further substantiate the assertion, the attention of the court was drawn

to evidence of the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent, who accepted that it was his

fathers signature on Deed No. 41 (vide page 425 of the Brief) and that

even the District Judge in his judgment accepted the placement of the

signature of C.H. Weerasinghe, thus, it was contended that it further

established that he was of sound mind, memory and understanding when

the deed was executed.

10

(23) The 2nd Defendant-Appellant has sought to justify the gifting of the property

to the 1st Defendant-Respondent, by highlighting the evidence given by the

1st Defendant -Respondent during the trial. According to the 1st Defendant-

Respondents evidence, he was married to the niece of C.H. Weerasinghe

and had been treated as his adopted child. The 2nd Defendant contrasted

this with the estranged relationship between the Plaintiff-Respondents and

C.H. Weerasinghe which is evidenced by the testimony of O.J. Jayawardena

who stated that when the Plaintiff-Respondents visited him once every two

to three months, they stayed only for a few minutes.

(24) In his evidence, the 1st Defendant-Respondent stated that he used to visit

C.H. Weerasinghe at witness Jayawardenas residence, who had stated that

he wished to donate the property in suit to the 1st Defendant-Respondent.

The 1st Defendant -Respondent also stated that when he went to the Notary

Publics office on 2nd July 1977, he met C.H. Weerasinghe and two

witnesses and the said deed was executed by C.H. Weerasinghe and that he

too signed the deed accepting the said gift. He admitted that the same had

been transferred in the name of the 2nd Defendant-Appellant in 1980 by

Deed No. 21525 and strongly denied that C.H. Weerasinghe was of

unsound mind at the time he transferred the land in his name.

(25) To further buttress the 2nd Defendant-Appellants position regarding C.H.

Weerasinghes mental state, attention was also directed towards the

admission made by the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent at the trial regarding his

correspondence with his father after he was discharged from the mental

hospital. It is to be noted that 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent had admitted that

his father, while he was residing with O.J. Jayawardena, sent postcards to

him and that he, in return, sent his father postcards to inform him of the

dates of his to visits. It was suggested that the postcards had allegedly been

destroyed by the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent, which allegation was refuted by

him. In the light of this evidence, it was submitted that Weerasinghe was

not mentally deranged as the Plaintiff- Respondents had tried to make out

when he was at Jayawardenas and could not have corresponded with him

if he had been a lunatic.

11

(26) With respect to the validity of Deed No. 21525, the 2nd Defendant-

Appellant giving evidence at the trial stated that she did not know of C.H.

Weerasinghes mental disabilities, and only entrusted her Notary, Arthur

Wijesuriya with the task of examining the title to the land. Arthur

Wijesuriya, giving evidence, stated that he examined the title before he

attested the deed and recommended to the 2nd Defendant-Appellant that

the title was good and therefore at her request, attested the deed. The 2nd

Defendant-Appellant claimed that she was not aware of the mental illness

of C.H. Weerasinghe prior to and during the period material to the

execution of the deed.

(27) It was submitted that in any event, the 2nd Defendant is a bona fide purchaser

for valuable consideration without any knowledge whatsoever of the mental

ailments of C.H. Weerasinghe and that in the circumstances the 2nd

Defendant-Appellant is entitled to the said property.

The position of the Plaintiff-Respondents

(28) The Plaintiff-Respondents argued that what has to be decided is whether C.H.

Weerasinghe executed Deed No. 41 during a lucid interval, which has been

conceded by the original Defendants by issue No. 12 which states (in

translation) At the time Charles Hector Weerasinghe executed Deed No. 41,

did he sign the deed voluntarily, conscious of what he was doing?

(29) The argument on behalf of the Plaintiff-Respondent was, that an insane

person is presumed to be so, until it is shown that he has recovered and that

the original Defendants on whom the burden of proof lay had failed to

discharge that duty. The contention of the Plaintiff-Respondents is that C.H.

Weerasinghe was mentally deranged up to his death in 1977. It was the

contention of the Plaintiff-Respondents that he was lodged at the house of

O.J. Jayawardena on the advice of his doctor who said that he should be kept

in a place where he could be well provided for, and was close to the hospital

so that he could be taken to the clinic every week (vide page 417 of the

Brief).

(30) In countering the evidence adduced by the Defendants regarding the mental

state of C.H. Weerasinghe, the Plaintiff-Respondents argue that despite the

12

assertion that it was the expert opinion of specialist doctors at the hospital

that C.H. Weerasinghe had fully recovered from his mental illness, no expert

opinions were adduced during the trial. It was argued that the most

important evidence that can be led to establish a persons sanity is medical

evidence. However, the 2nd Defendant-Appellant has primarily relied on the

opinions of the male nurse, O.J. Jayawardena who cannot be regarded as an

expert who is fully capable of assessing and submitting a professional

opinion with respect to Weerasinghes mental state to the satisfaction of the

court. With respect to the testimony of O.J. Jayawardena, the Plaintiff-

Respondents have highlighted the admissions made by him when giving

evidence, which points to the fact that C.H. Weerasinghe was of unsound

mind even after he was discharged from the mental hospital.

(31) According to O.J. Jayawardena, C.H. Weerasinghe suffered from simple

schizophrenia and had experienced moments where he would zone out and

stare into the distance (vide pages 474-475 of the Brief). He proceeded to

admit that C.H. Weerasinghe would recover when given medication. The

admission was also made that C.H. Weerasinghe was given

psychopharmaceutical drugs on certain occasions, during his stay at O.J.

Jayawardenas residence. (vide; pages 470 and 478 of the Brief).

(32) To further strengthen the assertion that C.H. Weerasinghe remained a

mentally deranged individual to his death, the original Plaintiffs to the

action, submitted two letters addressed to the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent by O.J.

Jayawardena marked P11 and P12. In the letter marked P11 dated 25th

March 1972, O.J. Jayawardena states as follows with respect to C.H.

Weerasinghe, he is also getting vitamin tablets and

psychopharmaceuticals. In the letter marked P12 dated 9th October 1965,

the male nurse states as follows, Mrs. Weerasinghe, his doctor is on

maternity leave. So I am getting treatment for him from Dr. Sittampalam.

Which confirms the position that that Weerasinghe continued to receive

professional treatment for his mental disorder even after he was discharged

from the hospital.

(33) Commenting on the evidence pertaining to placement of C.H. Weerasinghes

signature on Deed No. 41 and the Notary Public Chandrapala Hettiges

13

evidence, the Plaintiff-Respondents argue that it those testimonies are

inadequate to establish C.H. Weerasinghes sanity. It was submitted that

attention must be given to the fact that although the 1st Defendant-

Respondents claimed that he informed the Notary Public Chandrapala of

C.H Weerasinghes period of treatment at the Angoda Hospital (page 336 of

the Brief), this was denied by the Notary Public who claimed that if this

information had been divulged to him, he would not have executed the deed

(page 356 of the Brief). Witness Chandrapalas evidence recorded in the first

trial was adopted by the consent of the parties.

(34) The Plaintiff-Respondents also note that, in Deed No. 41 Eron Singho is

referred to as the step-son of C.H. Weerasinghe, which they argued

indicated that at the time of the execution of the Deed, Weerasinghe was

under the insane delusion that he was married to Eron Singhos mother.

(35) The Plaintiff-Respondents Counsel argued that the postcards supposedly sent

by the 2nd Plaintiff Respondents father contained no meaning, [pg. 427 of

the Brief]. They claimed that if these postcards had not been destroyed, they

would have proven that C.H. Weerasinghe was still mentally ill and

receiving treatment. Therefore, due to lack of expert evidence, medical or

psychiatric, the presumption of insanity persists, and Deed No.41 and the

ensuing Deed No.21525 are invalid, according to the Plaintiff-Respondent.

The Legal position

(36) The sanity of a person is presumed, [ R vs Laytou 1849 4 Cox C.C 149 at155]

unless the court adjudicates otherwise. If a court had declared someone to be

insane, our law presumes this status still exists, though this can be disproved

by clear evidence. This case concerns whether C.H. Weerasinghe who had been

determined to be insane, could have signed a deed while adjudication was still

in force. The first issue to be considered is whether he was having a lucid

interval or had sufficiently recovered or rational. The second issue is what

proof is needed to establish that he was of sound mind at the time of signing

the deed, given the courts prior adjudication of insanity.

(37) The learned President's Counsel for the 2nd Defendant-Appellant argued that,

according to the law, a person who has been declared of unsound mind by a

14

competent court does not need to seek a Court order to prove his sanity under

Section 578 of the Civil Procedure Code. He also argued that, in this situation,

the applicable law should be Roman Dutch Law and not English Law. I agree

with this contention, as our law differs from English Law in that an

adjudication is not considered conclusive proof of lunacy. In English Law, any

contract entered into by an adjudicated person while the order is in place is

null and void [In re Walker L.R. 1905 1 Ch.8 at 160].

(38) The learned Counsel on behalf of the Plaintiff-Respondents on the other hand

argued that a person who is adjudicated insane is presumed to be so until it is

established that he had a lucid interval at the relevant time or that he had

recovered from lunacy and the burden of establishing that fact is on the party

so contending, before the court. It is trite law that lunacy is a contractual

disability. Our courts, however, have recognized that a person of unsound

mind could enter into valid contracts during a lucid interval. A lucid interval

as understood in law refers to a perfect restoration to reason or a temporary

cessation of the insanity (vide A.G. vs. Parnther (1792) 3 Bro. C. Rep. 442)

which in turn would enable such individual to understand the nature and

effect of a deed or contract.

(39) This principle of law is laid down in the cases of Hamid vs. Marikkar (1951)

52 NLR 269 and in the case of Amarasekara vs. Jayanetti 64 CLW 17.

In the case of Amarasekera vs. Jayanetti (supra), in which the appellant who

was adjudged to be of unsound mind and incapable of managing his affairs

had conveyed his interests in certain lands by way of deeds to the husband of

the respondent, T.S. Fernando J. held,

(1) an alienation of land executed during a lucid interval by a person

adjudicated by the District Court to be of unsound mind and incapable of

managing his own affairs, is valid even though the execution has taken place

while the adjudication remains unreversed. [emphasis added]

(2) That this question must be determined by the Roman Dutch Law and not

by the English Law. The provisions of Chapter XXXIV of the Civil Procedure

Code have not superseded the Roman-Dutch law on this point.

15

(40) In the case of Hamid vs. Marikar (1951) 51 NLR 269, which arose in respect of

a mortgage bond executed by a person who had been adjudicated to be of

unsound mind at a time when the adjudication stood unreversed, Swan J.,

observed (at page 272);

Whether the mortgage bond entered into by Razeena Umma was null and void

is a matter of interest. If it was executed by her during a lucid interval, it would,

under the Roman-Dutch law, be considered valid. Under English law, however,

once a person is adjudged to be of unsound mind and incapable of managing

his affairs, any contract entered into by him, while that order stands, is null

and void.Under the Roman-Dutch law, however, a contract made by a

person, declared by a competent Court to be a lunatic and for whom a curator

has been appointed, would be valid if it was made during a lucid interval.

[emphasis added]

Swan J., proceeded to cite the position taken up in the South African case of

Prinsloos Curators vs. Crafford and Prinsloo (1905) T.S. 669. In this case

Prinsloo had, by order of Court been declared to be of unsound mind and

curators were appointed. He married two years later and it was proved that he

was no longer insane. It was contended that he could not contract while the

order was in force. The Transvaal Supreme Court held that;

an order declaring an alleged lunatic to be of unsound mind was not a

judgment in rem but only operated, while in force, to create a rebuttable

presumption that he was a lunatic.

(41) Therefore, the rebuttable presumption of lunacy can be held to be recognized

by our law. Professor Weeramantry in his The Law of Contracts- at page 467

draws the distinction between the Roman-Dutch law and English law in the

following words;

It is always a question of fact whether the person in question was

mentally defective at the time of his making a contract. If there has been an

adjudication of lunacy by a Court, there would under our law be a presumption

of continuance of this condition, but this is rebuttable by clear evidence to the

contrary. Our law differs in this respect from the English law under which an

16

adjudication operates as conclusive proof of lunacy, and any contract entered

into by the adjudicated person while such order stands is null and void.

(42) Therefore, in light of the abovementioned observations, the inference that can

be drawn is that our law does not prohibit a person who has been declared to be

of unsound mind by a competent court to enter into a contract when it can be

shown that he was of sound mind and understood the nature of the transaction

at the time he entered into it. The rationale behind this principle is succinctly

enunciated by Professor Lee in Introduction to Roman-Dutch Law (5th Ed.) at

page 115 as follows;

It is tempting to speak of unsoundness of mind as constituting a status; but it

would not be correct to do so, for mental unsoundness is not necessarily

permanent or constant, and the question which must be answered is not, Has

the man been declared mad? but, Was he, in fact, incapable of understanding

the particular transaction which is brought in issue? If the answer is negative,

the transaction stands.

(43) Considering these observations referred to above, the question of law No. (v)

Whether our law prohibits a person who has been declared a person of

unsound mind by a competent Court to enter into a contract when such a person

was fully conscious and aware of what he intended to do and capable of

understanding the transaction?, must be answered in the negative, that is, in

favour of the Appellant.

The evidence and burden of proof

(44) In light of the legal principles pertaining to the instant case, attention shall be

directed towards the first (i) and ninth (ix) questions of law which are as follows;

(i) Did the Court of Appeal err in law by not taking into consideration that at the

time of the execution of Deed No. 41 by Hector Weerasinghe, he was quite

capable of managing his affairs as reflected by the uncontroverted evidence

adduced at the trial in respect of his mental capacity?

(ix) Did the Court below misdirect in law by insisting on a higher degree of proof

which is not required by the Roman-Dutch Law?

17

In light of the aforementioned judicial decisions, [as referred to in

paragraphs 41-43] it can be observed that a declaration of lunacy has no

conclusive effect and the logical inference that can be drawn is that, when

such declaration remains unrevoked the only legal effect would be to shift

the burden to the person who asserts the validity of the impugned contract

to satisfy the Court that the contractor was sane at the relevant time.

(44) Commenting on the onus of proof Solomon J in the South African case of

Prinsloos Curators vs. Crafford and Prinsloo (1905) T.S. 669, observed that;

an order declaring a person to be of unsound mind is conclusive proof of

the fact that at the time that the order was made such person was insane and

consequently an order of that nature merely shifts the onus of proof. For there

is no doubt a presumption that when a person has been declared to be of

unsound mind he continues to be of unsound mind, but it is open to him at any

time to bring evidence to satisfy the Court that subsequent to the date of the

order he became sane and that consequently a contract entered into by him

was a valid contract:

(45) Counsel on behalf of the Plaintiff-Respondents, on the other hand argued that

the presumption of lunacy/insanity created by a declaration of the court can

only be rebutted by leading expert evidence which is the most important

evidence that can be led to establish a persons sanity. Their contention is that

a lay individuals evidence can only supplement expert evidence and that there

was no strong medical evidence to support the alleged existence of a lucid

interval at the time the transaction was entered into. In this vein, the Plaintiff-

Respondents refer to the dicta of De Villiers J.P. in the case of Estate Rehne and

Others vs. Rehne;

I also take into consideration the expert evidence led to the effect that persons

subject to delusions may appear quite sane to the lay mind, and that they are

often secretive and, in many cases, will not tell their delusions to everyone but

only to their doctors, and that they are apt to disguise their delusions.

(46) The crux of the case rests on the mental state of C.H. Weerasinghe. Although it

is not a sine-qua-non, given the facts and circumstances of the case before us,

producing some evidence emanating from a source having expert knowledge

18

of the subject of lunacy would have been desirable on the part of the

Defendants to determine whether the disorder was still present, as the legal

burden of rebutting the presumption was on the Defendant.

(47) In the absence of such evidence, the finding of fact on the part of the learned

district judge in holding that C.H. Weerasinghe was a person of unsound mind

until his death cannot be faulted. The learned district Judge had relied on the

documents marked as P11 and P 12, both are letters written by witness

Jayawardena to the 2nd Plaintiff. In one letter written in 1977, [P11] he refers

to C.H Weerasinghe getting vitamin tablets and other

psychopharmaceuticals. The learned District judge, in concluding, had stated

that, having considered the evidence placed and the written submissions

tendered by both parties, he accepts the evidence placed on behalf of the

Plaintiffs, suggesting impliedly that the Defendants have failed to discharge the

burden of rebutting the presumption of lunacy.

(48) It is trite law that a factual finding by the original court should not be disturbed

on appeal, unless the finding is visibly erroneous. Therefore, the question of

law No. (ix) regarding whether the Court below misdirected itself in law by

insisting on a higher degree of proof which is not required by the Roman-

Dutch Law, must be answered in the negative.

(49) In light of this standard of proof, the Appeal was dismissed by the Court of

Appeal on the finding that the fact that C.H. Weerasinghe was experiencing a

lucid interval had not been proved at the trial as there was no evidence pointing

to the assertion that he was sane when the deed was being executed and the

Court of Appeal observed that they saw no reason to interfere with the judgment

of the learned District Judge.

(50) It is pertinent to note that the learned District Judge had the advantage of

observing the demeanor and the deportment of the witnesses and had analyzed

the entire gamut of evidence placed before the court, which is amply reflected

in the judgment. In the case of Gunawardena V. Cabral and Others (1980) 2 Sri.

LR 220, it was held that the appellate court will set aside inferences drawn by

the trial Judge only if they amount to findings of fact based on: - (a) inadmissible

evidence; or (b) after rejecting admissible and relevant evidence; or (c) if the

19

inferences are unsupported by evidence; or (d) if the inferences or conclusions

are not rationally possible or Perverse.

(51) On the perusal of the judgement of the learned District Judge, it cannot be said

that the findings and the inferences drawn by him are vitiated by any of these

considerations and therefore as rightly held by the Court of Appeal, there was

no justification for interfering with the conclusions reached by the learned

District Judge which are based on the evidence placed before him. Therefore, the

first question of law also must be answered in the negative.

The Applicability of Section 578

(52) Section 578 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows;

578. Further inquiry, when a person of unsound mind so found alleged to have

recovered.

(1) When any person has been adjudged to be of unsound mind and incapable

of managing his affairs, if such person or any other person acting on his

behalf, or having or claiming any interest in respect of his estate, shall

represent by petition to the District Court, or if the Court shall be informed

in any other manner, that the unsoundness of mind of such person has

ceased, the Court may institute an inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining

whether such person is or is not still of unsound mind and incapable of

managing his affairs.

(2) The inquiry shall be conducted in the manner provided in section 560 and

the four following sections of this Ordinance; and if it be adjudged that

such person has ceased to be of unsound mind and incapable of managing

his affairs, the Court shall make an order for his estate to be delivered over

to him, and such order shall be final.

(53) As regards capacity of a lunatic to contract during a lucid interval, the settled

position is that our common law [Roman Dutch law] on this matter must be

taken to have superseded the provisions of Chapter XXXIX of the Civil

Procedure Code (vide Amarasekera vs. Jayanetti (supra)). This, however, does

not imply that the provisions of the Code are of no avail. According to our

law, if a party to a contract is insane at the time of contracting, the contract

20

is null and void even though the other party contracted bona fide without

knowledge of insanity (vide Soysa vs. Soysa (1916) 19 NLR 314). Therefore,

if an application had been made under Section 578 to establish the sanity of

an individual declared to be a lunatic by a court of law, it would be beneficial

to that individual and other interested parties in securing the validity of

contracts or deeds executed for or on behalf of such individual.

(54) In the present case, however, the 2nd Defendant, who had purchased his rights

to the property from the 1st Defendant, was not aware that the original owner

C.H Weerasinghe was a person who had been adjudicated as a person of

unsound mind by the court. He had merely got the property transferred to

himself from the 1st Defendant after having checked the land registry as to

the devolution of title, and having satisfied himself that 1st Defendant Eron

Singho had title to the land in issue, he had proceeded with the transfer of the

property. Therefore, the questions of law [no. iv and viii] pertaining to

whether the Court of Appeal erred by not taking into cognizance that the 2nd

Defendant being a bona fide purchaser was not bound to make application in

terms of Section 578 of the Civil Procedure Code for a declaration that the

said Weerasinghe was of sound mind prior to the execution of Deed No.

21525 by the 1st Defendant and whether the Courts below err in law by the

conclusion that the presumption of lunacy created by the Court Order was

in operation as the Defendants had not taken steps under Section 578, must

be answered in the affirmative, in favour of the Appellant.

(55) In conclusion, it can be held, however, that the Defendant-Appellants had

failed to prove that C.H. Weerasinghe, [in respect of whose property his wife

was appointed by the District Court to manage his property until said lunatic

(Weerasinghe) is of sound mind and understanding], was of sound mind,

memory and understanding at the time of the execution of Deed No. 41.

Therefore, the conclusion of the learned District judge that, the Deed No. 41

is null and void ab initio and consequently, the 1st Defendant-Respondent had

no legal title to pass on to the 2nd Defendant-Appellant under Deed No.

21525, thus Deed No. 21525 should also be held to be null and void, in my

view, cannot be faulted.

21

Conclusions;

I have answered the questions of law referred to in subparagraphs (iv), (v) and

(viii) of paragraph 19 of the Petition of the Appellant in favour of the Appellant

and the questions of law referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ix) of the said

paragraph of the Petition in favour of the Respondents.

As referred to in this judgement, questions (i) and (ix) are the primary issues,

namely whether the Appellant [The 2nd Defendant] and the 1st Defendant have

rebutted the presumption of insanity [of C.H. Weerasinghe] by adducing

sufficient evidence. For the reasons set out, I have concluded that the finding of

the learned trial judge on that issue cannot be faulted. In the circumstances, the

judgement of the District Court and the Court of appeal are affirmed, and the

appeal dismissed.

The substituted 1st and 2nd Plaintiff Respondent -Respondent would be entitled

to the cost of this matter.

Appeal Dismissed.
