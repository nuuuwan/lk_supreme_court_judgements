"has been concerned in the commission of a cognizable offence."
"I
t would be seen that, a condition precedent for the arrest of a person under any one of"
"the four situations referred to above, is the (a) commission of an offence, and (b) a factual"
"and situational connection between the commission of that offence and the person being"
"arrested. In other words, before causing the arrest of a person, the peace officer who seeks"
"to  arrest  that  person  must  be  satisfied  founded  upon  reasonable  grounds  that  the"
"impugned conduct constitutes an offence and that one of the four situational and factual"
"connections between the commission of that offence and the person being arrested, exists."
"This should not be understood as insistence that the arresting officer should possess strict"
"proof that the suspect had committed an offence. Thus, unless, it can be established that"
"an offence recognized by the laws of Sri Lanka has been committed, the law would not"
"permit the arrest of a person for the conduct attributed to him."
