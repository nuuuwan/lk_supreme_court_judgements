"estrictions that are recognized and permissible with regard to the exercise of the human"
"right to free speech are contained in international human rights instruments such as the"
"ICCPR. Article 19(2) of the ICCPR provides as follows:"
"“The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special"
"duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall"
"only  be  such  as  are  provided  by  law  and  are  necessary:  (a)  for  respect  of  the  rights  or"
"reputations of  others; (b)  for the protection of national  security or  of  public order,  or of"
"public health or morals.”"
