"attendance  at  an  event  may  amount  to  forms  of  expression,  and  are  manifestations  of"
"communication.  Thus,  in  communication,  the  determinant  is  the  intention  (what  is"
"sought to be achieved by the disseminator) and attendant circumstances including how"
"it is perceived and what is understood by the intended recipients, as opposed to the form"
"in which communication is carried out."
