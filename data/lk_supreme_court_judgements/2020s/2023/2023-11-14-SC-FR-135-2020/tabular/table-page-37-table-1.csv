"rhetorical advocacy which is aimed at causing incitement to discrimination, hostility and"

"incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence must be prohibited and prevented. It"

"offender. Such action would take the manifestation of criminal justice measures, such as"
"the  arrest  of 
the  suspect, 
initiation  of  criminal  proceedings,  and  his  subsequent"
"prosecution.  However, 
the  adoption  of  such  measures  should  be  diligently  and"
"objectively carried out. Using such criminal justice measures against a person who is not"
"culpable  for  having  committed  an  offence  in  terms  of  section  3(1),  would  amount  to"
"infringement of that personâ€™s fundamental rights and would tantamount to persecution."

"opinion consider the following factors:"
"(i) 
Whether  the  content  of  the  speech  as  a  whole  with  specific  reference  to  the"
"impugned words, amounts to advocacy that takes the form of national, racial"
