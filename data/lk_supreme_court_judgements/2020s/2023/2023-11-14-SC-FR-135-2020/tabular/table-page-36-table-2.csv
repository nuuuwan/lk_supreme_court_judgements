"I
 find no reason to disagree with any of these features of the analysis of section 3(1) of the"
"ICCPR Act issued by the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka."
"It would be seen that, while Article 14(1)(a) recognizes the fundamental right to freedom"
"of speech and expression including publication, Article 15(2) recognizes that the exercise"
"and operation of this fundamental right shall be subject to such restrictions as may be"
"prescribed by law, which includes restrictions that may be prescribed in the interests of"
"racial and religious harmony and to prevent incitement to commit an offence. Section 3(1)"
"should be seen in the context of these restrictions. Therefore, while Article 14(1)(a) of the"
"Constitution confers on the people the fundamental rights to free speech, section 3(1) of"
"the ICCPR Act restricts such fundamental right to the extent of what is prohibited under"
"that section. When the exercise of a fundamental right is restricted by law, in my view"
"such law must be strictly interpreted (as some jurists claim, be narrowly interpreted) so"
"as  to  give  recognition  to  the  exact  purpose  for  which  the  Parliament  enacted  the"
"restriction, and for no other reason."
