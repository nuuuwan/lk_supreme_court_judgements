"However, I must note that, particularly in the aftermath of the Easter Sunday terrorist"
"attacks  of  2019,  undoubtedly  and  quite  understandably,  the  non-Muslim  users  of  the"
"Facebook who saw the Facebook post of the virtual petitioner of 2nd April, may have been"
"somewhat alarmed when they read the term ‘Jihad’. That term as submitted by the learned"
"State Counsel would to an ordinary non-Muslim reader mean the waging of a ‘holy war’"
"by those of the Islamic faith against those of all other faiths, and would be associated with"
"unleashing  of  violence  towards  those  who  are  not  of  the  Islamic  faith.  Nevertheless,"
"though a superficial reading of the post could have given rise to such alarm, no user of"
"the  Facebook  particularly  if  he  got  alarmed,  would  have  stopped  following  a  mere"
"superficial  reading  of  the  post.  A  word-to-word  or  careful  reading  of  the  post,  would"
"have  clearly  revealed  that  the  virtual  petitioner  was  advocating  the 
launch  of  an"
"‘ideological jihad’ with the use of the ‘pen and the keyboard’ and not any form of perpetration"
"of  violence.  He  also  did  not  incite  others  to  unleash  any  form  of  violence.  Thus,  no"
"reasonable  and  prudent  user  of  the  Facebook  would  have  concluded  that  the  virtual"
"petitioner  was  attempting  to  incite  the  perpetration  of  violence  by  members  of  the"
"Muslim community against members of non-Muslim communities. Therefore, it would"
"be wholly unreasonable and incorrect to conclude that the virtual petitioner attempted to"
"raise discontent or disaffection amongst the People of Sri Lanka, or promote feelings of"
"ill-will and hostility between different classes of such People. Thus, the ideology of the"
"virtual  petitioner  is  evidently  opposite  to  the  ideology  of  a  fanatical  terrorist  suicide"
"bomber who is a radicalized, intolerant, exclusivist, and hence is committed towards the"
"elimination  of  persons  of  all  other  faiths.  The  virtual  petitioner  does  not  fall  into  that"
"dangerous category."

"no  person  can  be  arrested  or  prosecuted  in  terms  of  the  law  for  having  allegedly"
