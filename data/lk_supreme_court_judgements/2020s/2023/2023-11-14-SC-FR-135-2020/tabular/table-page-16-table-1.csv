"cannot  exist  in  a  modern  state.  Social  control  is  needed  to  preserve  the  very  liberty"
"guaranteed.  All  rights  are  only  relative  and  not  absolute.  The  principle,  on  which  the"
"power of the State to impose restriction is based on the principle that, all individual rights"
"of  a  person  are  held  subject  to  such  reasonable  limitations  and  regulations  as  may  be"
"necessary and expedient for the protection of the general welfare of the society. Thus, it"
"is  important  to  note  that  the  guarantee  of  freedom  of  speech,  recognized  by  Article"
"14(1)(a) of the Constitution, does not give an absolute protection for every utterance. The"
"exercise of the rights conferred by this Article must not result in the violation of the rights"
"of others."
"The exercise of uninhibited free speech and other forms of expression by one person can"
"have  a  bearing  on  the  rights  and  interests  of  other  individuals,  the  wellbeing  and  the"
"welfare of the society as a whole, and the security of the State. That would be particularly"
"important  in  instances  where  the  right  to  free  speech  and  expression  is  sought  to  be"
"exercised  without  due  regard  to  the  rights  of  others  and  duties  and  responsibilities"
"towards others in society, which the law requires to be adhered to."
