"Justice  Sharvananda  in  Joseph  Perera  alias  Bruten  Perera  vs.  Attorney-General  and"
"Others4, are of significance:"
"“
… criticism of Government, however unpalatable it be, cannot be restricted or penalized"
"unless, it is intended or has a tendency to undermine the security of the State or public"
"order  or  to  incite  the  commission  of  an  offence.  Debate  on  public  issues  should  be"
"uninhibited,  robust  and  wide  open  and  that  may  well  include  vehement,  caustic  and"
"sometimes  unpleasant  sharp  attacks  on  Government.  Such  debate  is  not  calculated  and"
"does not bring Government into hatred or contempt.”"
