"or it may be what I may describe as sedition within the State. That is to say, it may be"
"directed  against  the  Government  and  the  measures  of  Government,  the  authority  of"
"Government and the administration of the courts which exercise justice in the name of the"
"Sovereign, or it may be calculated or designed to stir up ill-feeling between different"
"classes of the King’s subjects.”17"
