"As pointed out earlier, at the very core of the arrest of the virtual petitioner is an incurable"
"flaw. That is because  the virtual petitioner  had been arrested, notwithstanding his not"
"having committed an offence. Therefore, the period of police custody is also tainted with"
"that fundamental flaw relating to the arrest of the virtual petitioner. Thus, not only is the"
"arrest  of  the  virtual  petitioner  unlawful,  the  subsequent  period  of  police  custody  is"
"equally  unlawful.  In  the  circumstances,  I  conclude  that  the  holding  of  the  virtual"
"petitioner in the custody of the CID has amounted to an infringement of Article 13(1)."
