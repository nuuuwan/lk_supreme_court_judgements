"petitioner  in  remand  custody.  Accordingly,  since  9th  April,  he  had  been  detained  in"
"remand custody."
"I
t is in this backdrop that, while the virtual petitioner was being held in remand custody,"
"the  petitioner  filed  this  Application  on  behalf  of  the  virtual  petitioner.  The  petitioner"
"alleged that the virtual petitioner had not committed any offence and therefore there was"
"no  justification  for  arresting  him.  The  petitioner  claimed  that  the  conduct  of  the  1st"
"respondent in arresting, holding in custody and having the virtual petitioner remanded,"
"infringed the virtual petitioner’s fundamental rights."
"P
osition of the Respondents"
"Filing  an  affidavit,  the  1st  respondent  stated  that  information  pertaining  to  the  virtual"
"petitioner was first received by the CID from the Ministry of Defence. Consequently, an"
"investigation has commenced. Investigations revealed that the statements published by"
"the virtual petitioner on Facebook had given rise to racial and or religious hatred, which"
"could lead to disharmony and violence. Therefore,  the virtual petitioner’s activities on"
"the  Facebook  were  kept  under  surveillance  and  steps  were  taken  to  analyze  such"
"activities.  The  Facebook  post  published  by  him  on  2nd  April  2020  propagating  an"
"‘ideological war’ had given rise to 75 shares and 499 comments. This post spurred a wave"
"of  racially  hostile  sentiments  among  those  who  had  seen  the  post.  Investigations"
"conducted revealed that the said post had incited feelings of anger and hostility among"
"those  who  had  seen  it.  Therefore,  it  was  probable  that  such  sentiments  may  lead  to"
"violence amongst religious groups."
"T
herefore, the virtual petitioner was produced before the Chief Magistrate of Colombo"
"in MC action No. B 31673/01/20 on allegations that he had committed offences under"
"section 120 of the Penal Code, section 6 of the Computer Crime Act and section 3(1) of"
"the ICCPR Act. Accordingly, the virtual petitioner was placed in remand custody by the"
"Chief Magistrate."
"I
n the circumstances, the 1st respondent denied that he had infringed the fundamental"
"rights of the virtual petitioner."
"S
ubmissions of learned counsel"
"The very essence  of the submissions of learned counsel for the  petitioner was that the"
"publication  of  the  Facebook  post  in  issue  was  a  clear  instance  of  the  virtual  petitioner"
"having exercised his fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression including"
