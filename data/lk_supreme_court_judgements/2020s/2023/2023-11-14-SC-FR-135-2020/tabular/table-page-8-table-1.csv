"Speech and expression including publication"
"For the purpose of assimilating and disseminating information, views and ideas, civilized"
"human  beings  regularly  use  spoken  and  written  forms  of  language.  This  process  is"
"referred  to  as  ‘communication’.  In  most  forms  and  manifestations  of  communication,"
"there exists a dynamic and constant exchange of human interaction between those near"
"and  far.  Communication  mostly  involves  bi  and  multidirectional  flow  of  information,"
"thoughts, ideas and opinion. Some forms of speech and expression involve one-way flow"
"of information and expression of views, and are aimed at conveying information, ideas,"
"views, feelings and may be for the purpose of shaping public opinion. Both these forms"
"of speech and expression are essential for living and necessary for both individual and"
"collective realization of the true potential of life, and personal and social development."
"The use of speech, other forms of expression and their  publication  is a  sine qua non of"
"being born human, to a free country and is an essential prerequisite of any civilized and"
"organized society."
