"Sovereign, or it may be calculated or designed to stir up ill-feeling between different"
"classes of the King’s subjects.”17"
"I
t would  thus  be seen that,  the offence  contained in section 120 of the Penal Code has"
"essentially two components, which have been succinctly described by the then Attorney-"
"General. Another noteworthy feature is the classical formulation of the manner in which"
"the offence could be committed (the actus reus of the offence), that being by words, either"
"spoken or intended to be read, or by signs, or by visible representations, or otherwise."
"There is no doubt that the posting of a statement on Facebook (as alleged to have been"
"done by the virtual petitioner and admitted by him) constitute such a manner provided"
"by section 120."
"T
he definition of the offence also contains the causal effect of the afore-described conduct"
"of the offender, which serves as an extension of the actus reus. It is that causal effect which"
"the  legislature  has  sought  to  prevent  by  prohibiting  and  criminalizing  the  harmful"
"conduct. By the inclusion of the word ‘attempts’, the legislature has not insisted upon the"
"stipulated  result  (intended  by  the  offender)  occurring.  Criminal  culpability  and  penal"
"sanctions are attracted no sooner an attempt is made to cause the stipulated harm. The"
"actual  occurrence  of  harm  is  only  a  possible  consequence  of  the  offence  having  been"
"committed  and  not  an  ingredient  of  the  offence.  Of  the  several  possible  causal  effects"
"contained in section 120 of the Penal Code, what is relevant to the present matter is to"
"determine whether the virtual petitioner by his Facebook post of 2nd April, attempted to"
"promote  feelings  of  ill-will  and  hostility  between  different  classes  of  such  People,"
"which the former Attorney-General has described as “… calculated or designed to stir up ill-"
"feelings between different classes …”.18"
