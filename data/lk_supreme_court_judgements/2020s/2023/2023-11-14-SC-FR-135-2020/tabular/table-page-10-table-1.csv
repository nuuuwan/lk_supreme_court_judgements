"the ability  of the people  to use  them, have now become  constituent ingredients of the"
"fundamental right to free speech and expression including publication."
"H
owever, the availability of these digital modes of communication, their ability to reach"
"an  unprecedented  audience,  and  the  convenience  at  which  such  new  channels  of"
"communication  could  be  used,  have  also  given  rise  to  serious  concerns  regarding  the"
"nature  of  regulation  and  restrictions  and  their  enforcement  that  may  be 
justifiably"
"required for the protection of greater public and national good. Slander and defamation,"
"contempt,  unlawful 
intrusion 
into  privacy,  criminal  or  sexual 
intimidation,  fraud,"
"malicious  spreading  of  false  or  scurrilous 
information  and  material, 
incitement  to"
"violence,  perpetration  of  fraud  and  other  criminal  offences,  causing  ethno-social  and"
"religious  hatred  through  the  dissemination  of  hate  speech,  advocating  disharmony,"
"discrimination and hostility among communities, threats and attacks on national security"
"and manipulative and unethical tack-ticks to influence public thinking, are some and not"
"all the evils of abuse of modern means of digital communication."
"F
undamental Right to free speech and expression including publication"
"Article  14  of 
the  Constitution  which  has  been  codenamed 
‘the  Charter  of  Liberty’"
"personifies what it means to be born human, the freedom to lawfully use the cognitive"
"faculties  of  being  an  intellectual  being  as  opposed  to  being  a  non-human,  and  in"
"particular the ability to reap the full benefits of being a citizen of Sri Lanka. Article 14"
"provides  for  the  freedom  (a)  of  speech  and  expression  including  publication;  (b)  of"
"peaceful assembly; (c) of association; (d) to form and join a trade  union; (e)  to manifest"
"either by oneself or in association with others, religion or belief in worship, observance,"
"practice and teaching in public or in private; (f) to enjoy and promote one’s own culture"
"and to use his own language; (g) to engage in any lawful occupation, profession, trade,"
"business or  enterprise; (h) of movement and of choosing his residence within Sri Lanka;"
"and (i) to return to Sri Lanka. Thus, it would be seen that Article 14 contains rights which"
"are  so  fundamental  to  an  individual’s  spiritual,  holistic,  educational,  professional  or"
"occupational, economic, and social development and well-being. Article 14 is seen as an"
"external manifestation of the exercise of Article 10, which guarantees freedom of thought,"
"conscience and religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of"
"his choice. The opportunity to exercise these fundamental rights contained in Article 14"
"enables the achievement of individual, social and community development, resulting in"
"the country as a whole, developing and reaping the yields of prosperity. As Chief Justice"
"Sharvananda has said in Joseph Perera alias Bruten Perera vs. The Attorney-General and"
