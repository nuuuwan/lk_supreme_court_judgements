"Examination of compliance with the  fundamental right guaranteed by Article 13(2) (that"
"the suspect shall not be further held in custody, detained or deprived of personal liberty except"
"upon and in terms of the order of such judge made in accordance with procedure established by"
"law) would necessitate  this Court to consider the lawfulness of the order made by the"
"learned  Chief  Magistrate  on  10th  April  2020  placing  the  virtual  petitioner  in  remand"
"custody  and  the  several  subsequent  orders  made  extending  remand  custody  and  the"
"order made on 28th May 2020 refusing to grant bail. As such orders are judicial orders,"
"the jurisdiction vested in this Court by Article 17 read with Article 126 of the Constitution"
"would preclude this Court from examining whether the making of such judicial orders"
"have amounted to an infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 13(2)"
"of the Constitution. Thus, I shall not deal with that aspect of this case."
