Decided on: 24.10.2023.

Aluwihare PC J.

The respondent, who is an Attorney-at-law, has been called upon to show cause as to

why he should not be suspended or removed from office on the ground of conduct that

would be regarded as disgraceful or dishonourable by an Attorney-at-law.

3

When this matter was taken up for inquiry on 21.06.2023, the Respondent Attorney-at-

law sought permission of the court to withdraw his earlier plea of, not guilty and he

intimated that he wishes to plead guilty to the Rule. Accordingly, the application was

allowed and the Rule being read for the second time, the Respondent Attorney pleaded

guilty to the Rule.

The Respondent Attorney-at-Law [hereinafter referred to as the Respondent] engaged

himself to represent the All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (hereinafter the ACJU) in the

proceedings conducted on 9th September 2020 before the Presidential Commission of

Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into and Report or take Necessary Action on the Bomb

Attacks on 21st April 2019 (hereinafter the PCoI). Moulavi Murshid Marsa Mullaffar

was attending the proceedings of the PCol on 9th September 2020 representing the ACJU

in his capacity as the acting Secretary. The Respondent is accused of conveying the mobile

telephone of Moulavi Mullaffar, the said representative of the ACJU, bearing Subscriber

Identification Number [SIM] 0777 988 395 into the venue of the proceedings and aiding

Moulavi Mullaffar to record a part of the proceedings of PCoI on the said date, contrary

to the rules of the procedure of the PCoI.

By the aforesaid conduct the Respondent was alleged to have been in breach of Rules 60

and 61 of the Supreme Court (Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorney-at-Law) Rules 1988,

made in terms of Article 136 of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka.

The Respondent Attorney-at-Law has stated his case by affidavit dated 25th November

2020. The Respondent has admitted that he carried the mobile telephone of his client,

the said Moulavi Mullaffar into the venue of the proceedings. It is averred that Moulavi

Mullaffar had requested the Respondent to keep his mobile phone as he was not

permitted to take it into the premises. Only Attorneys-at-Law were allowed to take their

mobile telephones into the premises where the hearing of the Commission was taking

place.

4

The Respondent has stated that out of respect for the Moulavi as a member of the clergy

of the Respondents faith and trusting his word, he agreed to keep the mobile phone in

his custody. The Moulavi had indicated to him that the mobile phone was on flight

mode.

The Respondent in his affidavit has maintained that while the proceedings were ongoing

a mild sound had emanated from the mobile phone and it had started vibrating. Failing

to switch it off by pressing the power button, the Respondent has stated that he passed

the phone to the Moulavi who was seated two rows behind him, so that the Moulavi

could switch if off. As the proceedings were ongoing and the Respondent was assisting

his Senior Mr. Javed Yousuf to cross-examine Ven. Galaboda Aththe Gnanasara Thero

who was giving evidence before the Commission on that day and taking notes he states

that he was unable to retrieve the phone from the Moulavi after he passed it over to him.

Furthermore, he states that he had no reason to doubt that the Moulavi would not follow

his instructions and not switch off the mobile phone.

The Respondent has stated that he was completely unaware of the alleged conduct of the

Moulavi and that, had he known of the intention of the Moulavi to record the proceedings

he would have declined to take the mobile phone into the venue of the proceedings. He

has further stated that he did not intend to abuse the privilege offered to him as an

Attorney-at-Law.

The Respondent has stated that he returned the mobile phone to the Moulavi during the

proceedings with the indication to turn it off, that he had no knowledge of any ulterior

motive on the part of the Moulavi and that he personally had no intention of recording

the proceedings of the PCoI. He has further stated that he was unaware that recording of

public hearings and/or hearings that were not conducted in camera before the PCoI is

prohibited.

On the other hand, the Moulavi Mulaffar in his statement to the police dated 09.09.2020

has stated that he had inquired from the Respondent about the possibility of recording

5

the proceedings on the mobile phone of the Respondent, which the Respondent had

allegedly refused to do stating that his mobile phone did not have sufficient memory to

record the proceedings. The Moulavi has stated that thereafter, he asked the Respondent

whether he can record from the Moulavis phone and the Respondent had asked him to

give the mobile phone to the Respondent after putting it on flight mode and switching on

the recording.

The Moulavi has further stated that at one point the Respondent returned the mobile

phone to him as it was not working and that thereafter the Moulavi has switched on the

recording and kept the mobile phone with him.

The inquiries made by the police unit attached to the PCoI, affirmed the fact that the

evidence led before the Commission in the afternoon session in fact had been recorded

making use of the mobile phone concerned. Sequel to this revelation, The Chairman of

the PCoI had referred this matter to the Supreme Court to consider whether the

Respondent was in breach of the Rules relating to Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorneys

-at -Law.

The Professional Purpose / Ethics Inquiry Committee of the Bar Association which

conducted an inquiry into this matter has observed that the Respondent Attorney had

knowledge of the notices placed at the Commission regarding preventive measures put

in place to prevent litigants and witnesses taking telephones inside the Commission Hall

where the proceedings were held. The said Inquiry Panel has observed that adhering to

Rules applicable to the PCoI relating to its proceedings forms part and parcel of

responsibilities and obligations towards the Supreme Court Rules applicable to Attorneys.

Pleading in mitigation, the learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the Respondent-

Attorney, submitted to the court that the court should take cognizance of the fact that the

Respondent expressed his unreserved regret and remorse over this incident without

wasting the time of the court. The learned Presidents Counsel urged this court to consider

that the Respondent is a young practitioner of law and is a father of an infant child and

6

that he solely relies on the income of his legal practice to support the family. It was also

pointed out that the Respondent had come up in life from humble beginnings. It was

submitted that due to this social disparity, he was overawed by the presence of the

Secretary of the ACJU which is considered a prestigious body of the people that belong to

the Islamic faith. Mr. Musthapha PC contended that it was due to these reasons that the

Respondent had agreed to take the phone of the Secretary of the ACJU as the request was

overbearing and he could not put the request of the Secretary down. The learned

Presidents Counsel further submitted that the Respondent Attorney had no intention

whatsoever to record the proceedings as averred in paragraph 31 of his affidavit

furnished to the Supreme Court. Mr. Musthapha appealed to the court to consider that

the proceedings before the Commission was public hearings with the presence of several

journalists covering the proceedings.

The learned DSG pointed out that Moulavi Mullaffar attended the proceedings on the

previous day [i.e. 8th September] as well and on that day his phone was left with the

officers who were in charge of the security of the Commission.

The Respondent belongs to the noble profession from which one is entitled to expect a

conduct appropriate to the profession which should be of a very high degree with utmost

honesty. We share the view of the Disciplinary Committee that the Respondent had full

knowledge of the notices placed at the Commission and therefore the restrictions that

were put in place. The complaint against the Respondent is a serious one. The degree of

punishment that should be imposed in cases of this nature is always a difficult decision

to make. We have taken into account the mitigating factors mentioned by the learned

Presidents Counsel and are also not unmindful of the consequences that our order would

have on the Respondent's life and future. We however feel that we must mark our

disapproval of the conduct of the Respondent in no uncertain terms and are of the view

that the professional misconduct that has been disclosed in this case calls for his

suspension from the roll of attorneys for a period of eight months.

7

The suspension of the Respondent from the practice will come into effect from 1st January

2024. The period of eight months will be reckoned from that date.
