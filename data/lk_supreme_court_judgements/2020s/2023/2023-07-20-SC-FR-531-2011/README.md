Petitioners to the instant case, two trade unions namely Engineering Diplomates Association and

Technical Officers Union both from the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (hereinafter referred

to as NWS&DB) along with six employees of NWS&DB who are members of the aforesaid two unions

had come before this Court alleging the violation of the Petitioners Fundamental Rights guaranteed

under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution by,

a) Failure to implement the Board decision dated 26th May 2011 (P-8), the Board Circular No

P2/3/EA(c)/Special dated 27th June 2011 (P-10), and the Memorandum of Understanding

(MOU) signed between the NWS&DB and the 1st and the 2nd Petitioners on 8th June 2011

(P-9)

b) Implementing the two decisions of the Department of Management Service (DMS) dated 1st

June 2011 (P-11) and 3rd October 2011 (P-14)

This Court on 4th October 2012 granted leave to proceed for the alleged violation under Article 12 (1)

of the Constitution.

5

When this matter was taken up for argument, the Solicitor General who appeared for the

Respondents raised a preliminary objection with regard to the maintainability of the instant

application on the ground that the 1st and the 2nd Petitioners being trade unions, cannot have

maintained the application on behalf of its members in terms of Article 17 read with Article 126 (2)

of the Constitution. The Solicitor General heavily relied on the decision in Ceylon Electricity

Accountants Association V. Patali Champika Ranawaka and Others SC FR 18/2015 SC minute dated

11.03.2016 when raising the above objection.

Except for the first -two Petitioners six other Petitioners, also had come before this Court, when filing

the instant application, and as revealed before us they are office bearers and members of the 1st and

2nd Petitioner Associations who were said to have affected with the impugned decisions of the 3rd

Respondent.

In the case of N.B. Krishantha Kumara and three others V. Dharmasena Dissanayake and Others SC

FR 460/2017 SC minute dated 01.03.3023, this Court has considered several decisions of the

Supreme Court including, the decisions in Ceylon Electricity Board Accountants Association V. Patali

Champika Ranawaka (Supra), Public Services United Nurses Union V. Montague Jayawickrema

Minister of Public Administration and Others 1988 1 Sri LR 229, and Environmental Foundation V.

Urban Development Authority (2009) 1 Sri LR 123 had now concluded that it is clear that the locus

standi of an unincorporated body that comes before the Supreme Court in an application filed under

Article 17 read with Article 126 (2) is now settled and the Court has permitted the members of the

unincorporated body to pursue the application in the instances when their rights guaranteed under

the Constitution has been violated by the conduct of the Respondent. Therefore, I see no merit in

the first objection raised by the Respondents before this Court.

Having considered the objection raised and the decision of this Court referred to above, I reject the

objection raised before this Court.

As submitted by the Petitioners the 3rd to the 8th Petitioners are holders of National Level Engineering

Diplomas awarded after full-time courses ranging from 3 to 3 years, and such diploma holders

were recruited to the NWS&DB to Board Grades 11 or 10 based on their qualifications. As per the

Scheme of Recruitment (SOR) which was in operation at that time, officers who were recruited to

Board Grades 11 and 10 were promoted to Board Grades 9 and 8. Once an officer reaches Board

Grade 8 and obtained 3 years of experience as an Engineering Assistant CL-l Board Grade 8, he will

6

become eligible to be promoted to the position of Engineer Board Grade 7. However, only 25% of

the total available number of cadre positions of Engineer CL-l, CL-ll, and Senior Engineer were

available for the promotion of Engineering Assistants CL-I Serving in Board Grade 8.

It was also the position of the Petitioners before this Court that, a total of 12 years, 17 years, or 21

years were required based on the Education Qualifications and the Board Grade an Officer was

recruited, in order for the officers to become eligible to be promoted to the position of Engineer

Board Grade 7.

Those who were not successful in entering Board Grade 7 as an Engineer Board Grade 7 due to the

above restriction, the Officer will be stagnated as an Engineering Assistant (Special Grade) Board

Grade 7 until their retirement from the service.

However, those who were recruited to Board Grade 11 as Quantity Surveyors and Draughtsmen with

similar qualifications were entitled to be promoted beyond Board Grade 7 up to Board Grade 3, 4, or

5 during their carrier. In those circumstances, it was submitted that those who do not fall within the

25% slot as Engineer Class II in Board Grade 7 have a long period of stagnation without any prospect

of promotion beyond Board Grade 7.

In those circumstances several discussions were held between the management of the NWS&DB and

the 1st and the 2nd Petitioners and an agreement was reached between the two parties and a MOU

was signed. The progress made during the discussion and thereafter has been summarized as follows;

a) It was decided at the meeting held on 2nd December 2010 to take steps to enable the

Engineering Assistant (Special Grade) Board Grade 7 to arrive at Board Grades 5 and 6.

b) A Board paper titled Promotional path for Engineering Assistants-Special Class up to

Board Grade 6 and 5 dated 20th January 2011 was submitted to the NWS&DB Board.

(P-6) In the said Board paper it was recommended that; to create Board Grade 6 and 5

in the SOR of Engineering Assistants subject to the conditions contained in the Board

paper.

c) The said recommendation was approved by the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage

and by letter dated 27th April 2011 Secretary to the Ministry advised the 2nd Respondent,

of the manner in which the recommendation is to be implemented (P-7)

d) Special instructions were given in the said letter,

7

i. To promote the Engineering Assistants- Special Grade, who had completed

6-10 years to Board Grade 6

ii. To promote the Engineering Assistants- Special Grade, who had completed

more than 10 years to a Grade above Board Grade 6

iii. The promotions should be personal to the said officers

iv. To propose a suitable designation to those who were promoted under

these instructions

e) By Board decision dated 26th May 2011 the said instructions were adopted by the

NWS&DB Board of Directors.

f) Based on the above decisions MOU was signed between the 1st and 2nd Petitioners and

the 2nd Respondent to give effect to the said decisions and it was further agreed between

the parties that the agreement is only applicable to 362 officers only.

g) Accordingly, by P-10 NWS&DB had called for applications by advertisement dated

27.06.2011 to give effect to the above agreement from those who were eligible i.e.,

Engineering Assistant Special Grade completed more than 10 years in Board Grade 7 for

the post of Assistant Engineer (this designation was decided by NWS&DB under (d)-IV

above) Board Grade 6 and to place them at a salary scale of MM I-I and Engineering

Assistant-Special Grade who has worked more than 6 years and less than 10 years in

Board Grade 7 for the post of Assistant Engineer Board Grade 6 and to place them at a

salary scale of JM l-2.

Whilst the above process was in progress Department of Management Service had forwarded new

cadre recommendations to the NWS&DB by letter dated 1st June 2011. (P-11) As submitted by the

Petitioners before this Court, in the said cadre recommendation a post was created as Assistant

Engineer for those who belong to the cadre of Engineering Assistant-Special Board Grade 7 but

placed them in the salary scale of JM l-2 which is contrary to the MOU already signed between the

1st and 2nd Petitioners and the 2nd Respondent. It was further observed that P-11 had not provided

any promotional path for Engineering Assistants in Board Grade 7, those who do not fall within the

25% slot as the Engineer category, but provided positions in the MM category for Quantity Surveyors

and Surveyors who were also recruited to Board Grade 10 and 11 along with the Petitioners.

8

During the same time, the Engineers Union of the NWS&DB too had objected to P-10 specifically for

the positions provided in Board Grade 5 and 6 for the Petitioners and naming those positions as

Assistant Engineers instead of the remaining designation Engineering Assistants.

Since there were threats of Trade Union action by both parties, i.e., by the 1st, 2nd Petitioners and

Engineers Union, the 2nd Respondent decided to refer the matter to the Department of Management

Services for their recommendation but continued in holding the interviews for Engineering Assistants

Board Grade 7as per the applications called by P-10.

In the said circumstances, it was alleged that all attempts made to resolve the issues faced by the

Engineering Assistants mainly with regard to their promotions beyond Board Grade 7, by

a) Holding discussions with the Management of the NWS&DB and signing an MOU between

the two parties

b) The relevant Ministry and NWS&DB agreeing to grant promotions to the Engineering

Assistants belonging to Board Grade 7 special to Board Grade 6 and above based on their

experience

c) Calling for applications from the qualified Engineering Assistants to implement the MOU

signed between the two parties,

in order to resolve the stagnation of the Engineering Assistant failed, but holding the interviews

without any assurance and/or without any final decision of resolving the main grievance i.e., granting

promotions beyond Board Grade 7, was in violation of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners to

equal protection of Law guaranteed under article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

In addition to the parties who were made as the Respondents to the instant application, including

the Secretary to the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage, the Director General of the Department

of Management Service, and the Secretary of the National Salaries and Cadre Commission, Engineers

Union of the NWS&DB came forward to resist the application filed by the Petitioners before this

Court. The Engineers Union of NWS&DB filed papers before this Court and sought permission from

this Court for intervention in the instant application. The application for intervention was also

supported before this Court on 4th October 2012 when the main matter was supported for leave to

proceed, and this Court permitted intervention by the Engineers Union of NWS&DB to the instant

case.

9

On behalf of the 2nd Respondent, the General Manager of the NWS&DB and the 3rd Respondent had

filed affidavits explaining how the decisions that were challenged before this Court were arrived by

the Respondents. In this regard, the position taken by the 3rd Respondent before this Court is very

much material since the decisions that were challenged by the Petitioners were decisions made by

the 3rd Respondent. In his affidavit filed before this Court the 3rd Respondent had submitted that;

a) Pursuant to the Budget Speech 2006, the Government made a policy decision to implement

a new salary structure for the Public Service, and the Public Administration Circular 6 of 2006

dated 25.04.2006 was issued containing the restructured salaries of the Public Service.

b) With the introduction of the new salary structures, the Public Service needs to be re-

structured to fit into the salary scales proposed by the circular.

c) With the above proposal, it was also decided to revise the salaries of employees in public

Corporations, Statutory Bodies, and Government own business undertakings except those

whose salaries were determined by collective agreements

d) In order to implement the above proposal and to restructure the organizational structures to

implement the new salary structures, Management Service Circular 30 of 2006 dated

22.09.2006 was issued by the Department of Management Service (3R2)

e) Consequent to the issue of the said circular, discussions were held with the institutions

referred to in paragraph c above including the NWS&DB with the participation of the officials

of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of National Water Supply and Drainage and National

Salaries and Cadre Commission

f) As a result of the said discussions regarding the NWS&DB it was agreed to implement the

common management structure proposed in the said circular and to abolish the Board Grade

system followed by NWS&DB

g) The said decision was communicated to the 2nd Respondent by letter dates 23.05.2011 (3R5

and 3R5A) and the cadre based on the above structure relevant to NWS&DB was informed to

the 2nd Respondent and the relevant Ministry by letter dated 01.06.2011 (3R6)

h) As per the said decision the Cadre for Engineering Assistant Class III, II and I was 700 under

MA 2-2 category and the Engineering Assistant (Special Grade) Board Grade 7 which existed

in the 2nd Respondent was re-designated as Assistant Engineer and a cadre of 390 was

approved under JM I-2 category.

10

As submitted by the 3rd Respondent, the said decision which was communicated to the 2nd

Respondent and the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage was in terms of the policy of the

Government embodied in Public Administration Circular 6/2006 and Management Service Circular

30 of 2006 and the 3rd Respondent was unaware of any agreement reached between the 2nd

Respondent and the Petitioners to the instant application outside the provisions of the circular. It

was the position taken up by the 3rd Respondent before this Court that any agreement reached

contrary to the provisions of the circulars referred to above is in violation of the policy of the

Government.

On behalf of the 2nd Respondent Board, the General Manager of NWS&DB Liyanage Lal Premanath

had submitted an affidavit before this Court. According to the said affidavit, on behalf of the 2nd

Respondent, it was submitted that,

a) At the time the Management Service Circular 30 of 2006 was issued, the Engineering Assistant

(Special Grade) Board Grade 7 were eligible to apply for 25% of the vacancies in the cadre of

Engineers provided they possess the requisite experience. Since the cadre of Engineers at

NWS&DB was 418 at that time, 105 posts were available for Engineering Assistants.

b) Similar to Quantity Surveyors and Draughtsmen who were provided with a promotional path

up to Board Grade 5, the Engineering Assistants too had the opportunity to secure

promotions to Board Grade 6, 5, 4, and beyond, depending on the availability of vacancies in

the cadre of Engineers, Chief Engineer, and Senior Manager posts such as Deputy and

Additional General Manager subject to the above restriction. At the time the affidavit was

tendered to Court, there were 03 Additional General Managers, 02 Deputy General

Managers, and 06 Chief Engineers who were initially recruited as Engineering Assistants to

the NWS&DB.

c) However, the 2nd Respondent was concerned with the grievance complained on behalf of the

Engineering Assistants by their Trade Unions, and it was agreed after obtaining necessary

approvals from the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage and the Board of the NWS&DB to

promote certain Engineering Assistants in the Special Grade as being personal to them in the

following manner,

Engineering Assistants in Special Grade with 6 to 10 years of service are to be

promoted to Board Grade 6 and placed on the initial of the applicable salary scale and,

11

Engineering Assistants with over 10 years of service are to be promoted to Board

Grade 6 and to be placed on a higher step of the applicable salary scale.

d) Steps were taken to implement the above decisions by advertising the above positions but

the interviews to select the eligible candidates could not be held due to;

i. Engineers Union of the NWS&DB raised objections threatening Trade Union

action

ii. A communication received from the Department of Management Service

approving the New Cadre to NWS&DB implementing the Management Service

Circular 30 of 2006.

e) Subsequent to the issue of Management Service Circular 30 of 2006, the Department of

Management Service wrote to the 1st and 2nd Respondents explaining the manner in which

the above circular should be implemented at the 2nd Respondent Board.

f) Several discussions were held between the stakeholders to implement the above Circular

with the NWS&DB and the 2nd Respondent Board were granted a salary increase of 22% with

effect from 01.01.2010, and a series of discussions were held thereafter to restructure the

posts in keeping with the above Circular.

g) Whilst the outcome of the said discussions was pending the 2nd Respondent engaged in some

discussions with the 1st and the 2nd Petitioners as referred to in subparagraph (c) above, since

the said unions complained of the grievance faced by its membership due to stagnation at

Board Grade 7.

As revealed from the material submitted before this Court by the 2nd and the 3rd Respondents it is

evident that the Engineers Union of the NWS&DB had objected to,

a) Holding interviews as per the MOU signed between the 2nd Respondent and the

two Petitioners to recruit Assistant Engineers from Engineering Assistant (Special

Grade) Board Grade 7

b) Re-designating Engineering Assistant (Special Grade) Board Grade 7 as Assistant

Engineers under JM I-2 category as per the decision of the Department of

Management Service which was communicated to the 2nd Respondent by letter

dated 23.05.2011

As already referred to in this judgment, the Engineers Unit of the NWS&DB had sought permission

to intervene in the instant application and the said application too was supported before this Court

12

on the same day, the main matter was supported for leave to proceed. This Court granted permission

for the Engineers Union to intervene in these proceedings. As revealed from the material placed

before this Court, the said Union had several reasons to object to the decisions of the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents, with regard to the promotions proposed to the Engineering Assistants (Special Grade)

Board Grade 7.

As submitted by the party sought permission to intervene, they had reasons to believe that;

a) The promotions agreed by the MOU signed between the 2nd Respondent and the first- two

Petitioners before this Court are contrary to the approved scheme of Recruitment of the

NWS&DB.

b) By promoting the Engineering Assistant to Board Grades 6 and 5 as agreed, will create an

imbalance in the management structure since that will provide an additional path for the

Engineering Assistant to get into the Higher Management of the NWS&DB.

c) The creation of a cadre designated as Assistant Engineer for Engineering Assistants (Special

Grade) Board Grade 7 is in violation of all accepted norms and principles in stating

professional nomenclatures.

During the Arguments before this Court, on behalf of the Engineers of the NWS&DB, it was further

submitted that the cadre for Engineers in the NWS&DB is only around 400 and the said 400 posts are

divided as per their qualifications as follows;

i. Holders of BSC Degree from a recognized University (240 at the time the papers were

filed before the Court)

ii. Those who joined NWS&DB with Diplomas and completed the Examination conducted

by the Institute of Engineers of Sri Lanka (IESL) or equivalent (60 at the time the papers

were filed before the Court)

iii. 25% allocated for Engineering Assistants (Special Grade) Board Grade 7 (100-at the

time the papers were filed before Court)

In those circumstances, it was submitted that grave prejudice would cause to the BSC Engineers of

the NWS&DB by creating an additional path for the Engineering Assistants outside the approved

scheme of recruitment of the NWS&DB.

13

At the time the Petitioners, including 5 Engineering Assistants of the NWS&DB complained about the

violation of their Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1), the grievance complained by

them was reflected in the matters that have already been discussed by me in this Judgment.

However, when the matter was taken up for argument, on behalf of the Respondents and the

Intervenient Petitioner- Respondents, it was submitted that the status quo is much different from

what it was, and submitted that the grievance complained before this Court no longer exists, and

that has now been resolved.

Even though the Presidents Counsel who represented the Petitioners before us does not fully agree

with the above submission, it is my duty to consider the above position to come to a correct finding

in this case.

The 3rd Respondent had explained the events that took place after communicating the decision of

the Department of Management Service by letter dated 23.05.2011 and 01.06.2011, in the

objections that were filed on 11th April 2012. As already referred to in this Judgment, the Engineers

strongly objected to renaming the designation of Senior Engineering Assistant as Assistant Engineers

and providing opportunities for promotions outside the scheme of recruitment to the relevant cadre.

The Engineering Assistants (Special Grade) Board Grade 7 were also unhappy with the decision to

implement the decision of the Department of Management Service ignoring the MOU already signed

to provide promotions beyond Board Grade 7.

It is at this stage the 3rd to the 7th Petitioners and the Unions; the 1st and the 2nd Petitioners came

before this Court seeking redress for their grievances. However, it appears that the parties to the

instant case had continued with discussion in order to resolve the grievance complained by the

Petitioners. It is important to note at this stage that the 2nd Respondent too had at one stage

accepted that the Engineering Assistants (Special Grade) Board Grade 7 who were not successful to

come within the 25% of the Engineers cadre had to stagnate in the same position until their

retirement and therefore agreed to resolve the issue by signing a MOU between the parties.

During the said discussions with all the stakeholders, parties explored the possibility of renaming the

designation of the post of Assistant Engineer which was proposed by the letter dated 01.06.2011

by the Department of Management Service, and also to resolve the issues of stagnation by placing

them beyond the J.M Category which was the basis for the proposed management structure by the

Department of Management Service under Management Circular 30 of 2006, since the Board Grade

14

structure was repealed by the Management structure proposed by the Department of Management

Service (P-11).

Even though the parties before Court had not fully agreed, two proposals were made during those

discussions, for the remaining cadre of Engineering Assistants (Special Grade)

a) To create the posts of work superintendent with a cadre of 28 (MM I-I salary code),

Senior Engineering Assistant with a cadre of 362 (JM I-2 salary code (3R7))

b) To create the posts as below instead of the posts referred to in (a) above

Senior Engineering Assistant (Supra) MM I-I

Senior Engineering Assistant JM I-2

with proposal (b) above it was further agreed to absorb Engineering Assistants (Special Grade)

who have over10 years of service to the post of "Senior Engineering Assistant (Supra) in the

employee category of Middle Manager and those with 6 to 10 years of service to the post of Senior

Engineering Assistant in the employee category of Junior Manager and to make those

appointments personal to those officers.

However, it is evident from the additional papers filed before this Court on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd

Respondent with permission of the Court after concluding the oral submissions made on behalf of

the Respondents including the Intervenient Petitioner Respondent, that the second proposal

referred to above had been given effect personal to those who were aggrieved from the SOR which

was in operation prior to the SOR introduced in 2011, and those officers have been granted

promotions even beyond the grades to which they were appointed with the implementation of the

New SOR based on the Management Circular 30 of 2006.

As per the papers filed before this Court, out of the six Petitioners before this Court (Petitioners 3-8)

five Petitioners were promoted to the post of Senior Engineering Assistant (Supra) Grade and the

other was holding the position as Senior Engineering Assistant at the time he was retired in the

year 2017. Among the five Petitioners who were promoted to Senior Engineering Assistant (Supra),

three of them were promoted to Engineers in the NWS&DB with effect from March 2018.

Out of the Balance 309 Engineering Assistants (Special Grade) Board Grade 7, who were the subject

matters in the MOU signed between the 1st and 2nd Petitioners and the 2nd Respondent, all officers

were promoted as Senior Engineering Assistants (Supra) Grade and out of them 60 were promoted

as Engineers. Out of the 309 officers, 80 officers are still in the Service holding the position either as

15

Senior Engineering Assistant (Supra) Grade or as Engineers, and the Balance had retired from the

service as Senior Engineering Assistants (Supra).

At the time the Petitioners came before the Supreme Court, the Petitioners whilst challenging the

Circular dated 01.06.2011 (P-11) requested to implement the agreement reached in the MOU (P-9).

As observed by this Court the MOU too had categorized the Engineering Assistants (Special Grade)

Board Grade 7, into two groups when implementing the agreement. i.e., those who serviced over 10

years and served between 6-10 years.

Even though there is no reference to these groups in P-11, the subsequent discussions had granted

relief to the same two groups and as revealed from the documentation filed after arguments, all

officers similarly circumstanced with the Petitioners were treated equally and promoted to Higher

grades, even as Engineers under the New SOR.

On behalf of the petitioners, an affidavit from the 3rd and the 4th Petitioners was tendered along with

a motion dated 18.05.2023, even after the preliminary draft judgment was circulated. However, it is

observed that the grievance complained in the said affidavit must be considered within the

remaining cadre of the NWS&DB, and as already observed in this judgment the matters had been

resolved within the remaining framework.

This Court on numerous occasions had declared the powers vested with the Cabinet of Ministers in

deciding the Policy, and Article 55 (4) of the Constitution (the text that was operative in the year

2000) and Article 55 (1) of the Constitution (the text that was operative after 9th September 2010)

granted the Cabinet of Ministers the following powers;

55 (4) subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for

and determine all matters of policy relating to public officers.

55 (1) The Cabinet of Ministers shall provide for and determine all matters of policy relating

to public officers, including policies relating to appointments, promotions, transfers,

disciplinary control, and dismissal

In the case of Samastha Lanka Nidahas Grama Niladhari Sangamaya and Others V. D. Dissanayake,

Secretary, Public Administration and Ministry of Home Affairs, and Others SC Appeal 158/2010 SC

minute 14.06.2013 this court observed;

16

The first substantive question that has to be determined on appeal, in this case, is purely

one of the vires and arises in the context of certain constitutional provisions which seek to

distinguish between two categories of decisions that can be made by the executive arm of

Government. The first of these are decisions relating to the appointment, transfer, dismissal,

and disciplinary control of public officers, which was vested in the Public Service Commission

by Article 55 (1) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka

(hereinafter referred to as the Constitution of Sri Lanka) as amended by the Seventeenth

Amendment thereto, which was in force at the time of the pronouncement of the impugned

judgment of the Court of Appeal the second of these categories are decisions pertaining to

policy, which in the context of the public service are exclusively vested in the Cabinet of

Ministers by Article 55 (4) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, as amended by the Seventeenth

Amendment.

As already revealed before us the two Circulars one with regard to the Public Service (Public

Administration Circular No 6 of 2006) and the other with regard to the Public Corporations, Statutory

Bodies, and state-owned Enterprises (Management Circular 30 of 2006) were issued to implement

the Government Policy declared in the Budget Speech 2006 to introduce a new salary and service

structures in the two sectors referred to above. The proposed structure to the Public Corporations,

statutory bodies, and state-owned Enterprises was to implement irrespective of the structures in

place at that time, and as a result, all Government Corporations, Statutory Bodies, and State-Owned

Enterprises will have similar service and salary structures within those institutions. In the

circumstances the Board Grade Promotions, that were identified in the SOR of the NWS&DB will have

no force and any decision to implement the said scheme will be in violation of the State Policy.

The new structure had provided a scheme, based on the management responsibilities instead of any

other categorization identified by the SOR of the respective Agency including the Board Grade system

at the NWS&DB.

The MOU signed between the parties too had provided a scheme to categorize Engineering

Assistants into two groups based on their service and to treat them separately under the remaining

Board Grade system. As already discussed in this Judgment the same categorization has been applied

under the new system and placed them in JM I-2 and MM I-I categories. In this regard the Petitioners

17

have failed to establish that they were differently treated as against the MOU signed between the

two parties when implementing the State Policy declared in Management Circular 30 of 2006.

Even though the Petitioners were reluctant to admit the fact that the grievances they complained

about were resolved by the New SOR with the amendments introduced after discussions with the

stakeholders, the fact that 3rd to the 8th Petitioners as well as all other officers, similarly

circumstanced at NWS&DB were granted promotions by the time the matter is taken up for

argument is the best evidence that reveals the outcome of the document challenged before this

Court.

Even though the amendments proposed had not specifically gone into the stagnation as

complained by the Petitioners, the implementation of the proposals had given ample opportunities

for the Engineering Assistants to be promoted as Engineers within the SOR introduced with the

implementation of the state policy.

In these circumstances, we hold that the Petitioners have failed to establish the violation of their

Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution as alleged in their Petition

filed before the Court.

The Application is therefore Dismissed.

We make no order with regard to costs.
