Judgement

Aluwihare, PC., J

1) The 2nd Accused -Appellant -Petitioner Appellant [hereinafter referred to as the

2nd Accused] was charged before the magistrates court of Mahawa for having

manufactured and distributed to the 1st Accused -Respondent-Respondent [herein

after the 1st Accused] a bottle of Coca-Cola containing impurities and/or foreign

matter, in violation of Section 2(1)(b) read with Section2(1)(a) of the Food Act

No.26 of 1980 as amended, an offence punishable under Section 18(1)(a) read

with Section 14(1)(a) of the said Act.

2) The 2nd accused was found guilty by the learned magistrate after trial and

accordingly a fine of Rs.10,000/-was imposed with a default sentence of 6 months

imprisonment.

3) Aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence, an appeal was lodged before the

High Court and the learned High Court Judge delivered judgement affirming the

conviction and the sentence and dismissed the appeal.

4) The 2nd Accused sought special leave to appeal from this court against the

judgement of the High Court and special leave was granted on the following

question of law;

Has the learned High Court Judge erred in failing to consider that the

Mahawa Magistrates Court is not vested with the jurisdiction to hear and

determine the case against the 2nd accused appellant-petitioner?

Factual Background

5) On 01.03.2009, Public Health Inspector [of Nan-Neriya] detected a [sealed] bottle

of Coca-Cola, a product of the 2nd Accused establishment, containing impurities

and/or foreign matter. After attending to the preliminary investigations, the bottle

of Coca -Cola was forwarded to the Government Analyst. The Analyst, upon

analyzing the contents, had detected foreign matter, which has been referred to as

suspended impurities

in the liquid and had expressed the opinion that the contents were not fit for

human consumption. It should be noted that what led to the detection was the

5

information provided by a person in charge of running a canteen who had

observed that the bottle, which had been supplied to her by the distributor of Coca-

Cola in the area, had some foreign matter in it.

6) After the investigations, both the distributor of Coca-Cola [the 1st accused] and the

producer [the 2nd Accused] were charged before the magistrates court. The 1st

accused pleaded guilty, whereas the 2nd accused contested the charge.

7) The only legal issue that came up for consideration before us was whether the

Magistrates Court of Mahawa had jurisdiction to hear and determine the charge

against the 1st Accused.

8) The learned Presidents Counsel argued that the charge against the 2nd Accused

was, for manufacturing a bottle of Coca-Cola that contained impurities. It was

pointed out that the manufacturing of the bottle of Coca-Cola concerned, took

place at Biyagama Thekkawatte, which is not within the local limits of the

magistrates Court of Mahawa. The State did not dispute this contention; thus, it

was common ground that Biyagama, Thekkawatte, was not within the local limits

of the Mahawa Magistrates court.

9) It was the contention on behalf of the 2nd Accused that the evidence led at the trial

had clearly established that the seal of bottle of Coca-Cola was intact and the

evidence showed that it had not been opened. Thus, it was argued that no

consequences of the offending act alleged, flowed to the local jurisdiction of the

Mahawa Magistrates Court. It was further contended by the learned Presidents

Counsel that Section 129 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

as amended [hereinafter the CPC] would have applied if the bottle of Coca-Cola

was opened and consumed, as one could argue that the consequences of the act of

manufacturing had ensued or flowed to the act of consuming thereby, by

operation of law, jurisdiction to try the offence would have vested with both; the

magistrates court within the local limits of which the act of manufacturing took

place and also with the magistrates court within whose jurisdiction such

consequence has ensued .

This can be easily gleaned from the illustration (a) to Section 129 of the CPC;

6

A is wounded within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the

Magistrates court of X and dies within those of the Magistrates Court

of Z; the offence of culpable Homicide of A may be inquired into by the

Magistrates Court of either X or Z. [emphasis added]

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel, in my view, is correct and Section

128 of the CPC requires the offence to be inquired into and tried by the court within

the local limits of whose jurisdiction it was committed. The learned State Counsel also

did not dispute this position. The learned Presidents Counsel in his submission relied

on Section 9(a) and Section 128(a) of the CPC and argued that a Magistrates Court

shall only try offences committed wholly or in part within its local limits.

10) The principal issue before this court, however, is whether the lack of jurisdiction on

the Mahawa Magistrates Court to try the offence, as argued by the learned

Presidents Counsel, is patent or latent. In determining the issue, it would be

necessary to consider the submission made by the learned Presidents Counsel

regarding the territorial jurisdiction of a Magistrates Court, in the backdrop of the

applicable provisions of the CPC in conjunction with the jurisprudence.

11) The contention of the learned State Counsel was that, ordinarily the offence with

which the 2nd accused was charged, is one that is triable by a magistrate and as such

there was no lack of patent jurisdiction, and the issue of latent jurisdiction must be

decided by the application of the legal principles and the relevant statutory

provisions.

12) The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel, on the other hand, was that the

Mahawa Magistrates Court lacked patent jurisdiction. The learned Presidents

Counsel also relied on an observation made by the Supreme Court in the case of King

vs. Perera 19 N.L.R.310. The Court observed [at pg. 312]

Another objection was taken to the ruling of the District Judge, namely,

that the accused, having pleaded in the District Court, could not afterwards

take objection to the jurisdiction in consequence of the provisions of section

7

73 of the Courts Ordinance. I think that this contention is not sound in the

present case. The Criminal Procedure Code by section 12 provides that no

District Court shall take cognizance of any offence, unless the accused

person has been committed for trial by a Police Court duly empowered in

that behalf, or unless the case has been transferred to it from some other

Court for trial by order of the Supreme Court.

(13) King vs. Perera [Supra] was a case where the District Court tried the accused

on a committal by the Police Court, and the issue was if the committal was

not made by a competent Police Court, whether the District Court could

have assumed jurisdiction. In view of the specific wording in Section 12 of

the then Criminal Procedure Code, the Supreme Court held that for the

District Court to assume jurisdiction, the committal must be from a Police

Court duly empowered to commit an accused. I am of the view that the

observation of their Lordships in the case of Perera [supra] has no

application to the instant case for the reason that none of the provisions

considered by the Supreme Court in that case would be applicable to the

instant case before us, but statutory provisions altogether different to that

of Section 12 of the earlier CPC, which provisions I have referred to later,

in this judgement.

14) Quoting an observation made by his Lordship Justice Drieberg in King vs.

Ludowyke 36 NLR 397 at p. 398, the learned Presidents Counsel sought to

establish that the learned Magistrate of Mahawa lacked the territorial

jurisdiction to hear this case. An extract, however, of the quoted judgment

at p. 398 must be highlighted.

Every offence must ordinarily be tried by a Court within the local limits of

whose jurisdiction it was committed A departure from this rule should

only be permitted in exceptional circumstances.

Therefore, it necessarily must be understood from his Lordship Justice

Driebergs observation that exception may be permitted, that he too, was

8

aware of the fact that even if the original court lacked territorial

jurisdiction, such defect is not fatal in all instances.

The learned Presidents Counsel also referred to the observation made by

Justice Middleton in the case of Halliday v. Kandasamy 14 N.L.R 493;

Per Middleton J.- This application of section 423 must by no means

be considered to obviate the requirements of the law that criminal

proceedings should be originally instituted in the Court having proper

and competent local jurisdiction.

(15) In the case of Halliday [supra] the court, while affirming the conviction, held that

the Police Court of Nuwara Eliya had no jurisdiction to try the case. The conviction

was affirmed as the accused was not prejudiced in his defence.

(16) In the case before us, neither party had disputed the fact that the Magistrates court

is vested with the jurisdiction to try the impugned offence, nor was the issue of

jurisdiction raised in the course of the proceedings before the magistrate.

(17) Therefore, the question which warrants determination is: If an accused is tried for

an offence before a forum which is vested with forum jurisdiction to try such an

offence but if such offence had taken place outside the local limits of that forum,

would the judgement be a nullity?

(18) It is trite law that an objection to the jurisdiction of a court must be raised by a party

at the earliest possible opportunity. It would be pertinent at this point to consider

the applicable provisions of the law.

(19) Section 39 of the Judicature Act states that; -

Whenever any defendant or accused party shall have pleaded in any action,

proceeding or matter brought in any Court of First Instance neither party shall

afterwards be entitled to object to the jurisdiction of such court but such court shall

be taken and held to have jurisdiction over such, proceeding or matter;

Provided that where it shall appear in the course of the proceedings that the action,

proceeding or matter was brought in a court having no jurisdiction intentionally

9

and with previous knowledge of the want of jurisdiction of such court, the judge

shall be entitled at his discretion to refuse to proceed further with the same, and to

declare the proceedings null and void.

(20) Section 39 of the Judicature Act must be examined in the light of patent and latent

want of jurisdiction. In his monumental work, The Law of Evidence, [ Volume 1, 2nd

Edition, 2012, Pages 131 & 132] E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy, relating to Section 39 of

the Judicature Act states as follows;

Can a party by admitting expressly or by implication the jurisdiction of a court confer

Jurisdiction on the court where none exists? Spence Bower and Turner say that not

even plainest and most express contract or consent of a party to litigation can confer

jurisdiction on any person not already vested with it by the law of the land, or add to

the jurisdiction lawfully exercised by any judicial tribunal, and the same results

cannot be achieved by conduct or acquiescence by the parties. These cases are

described as cases of a total or patent want of Jurisdiction.

On the other hand, where nothing more is involved than a mere irregularity of

procedure or for example, non-compliance with statutory conditions precedent to

the validity of a step in the litigation, of such a character that if one of the parties be

allowed to waive the defect, or to be estopped by conduct from setting it up, no new

Jurisdiction is thereby impliedly created and no existing jurisdiction extended beyond

its existing boundaries, the estoppel will be maintained and the court will have

jurisdiction. These are cases of partial or latent want of jurisdiction. In Sri Lanka

also, this distinction between a patent want of jurisdiction and a latent want of

jurisdiction has been drawn.

. It is submitted that the disability laid down by section 39 can only be availed of

in case of partial or latent want of jurisdiction and not of a total or patent want of

jurisdiction, though the section appears to be absolute in its terms. [Emphasis

added].

(21) It was held in the case of Don Tilakaratne vs. Indra Priyadarshanie Mandawala

(2011) 2 SLR 260-

10

even on restrictive interpretation of section 39 of the Judicature Act, the

petitioner is estopped in law from challenging the jurisdiction of the Magistrate

Court as the petitioner has conceded the jurisdiction of the Court and his failure to

object at the earliest possible opportunity implies a waiver of any objections to

jurisdiction.

(22) These observations indicate that Section 39 of the Judicature Act refers only to

instances where there is a latent want of jurisdiction, which can be cured by the

waiver, acquiescence, or inaction of the parties.

(23) A similar opinion was expressed in the case of Navaratnasingham vs. Arumugam

(1980) 2 Sri. L.R.1- and the court observed; where a matter is within the plenary

jurisdiction of the Court if no objection is taken, the court will then have jurisdiction

to proceed on with the matter and make a valid order.

(24) Our courts have drawn a distinction between patent want of jurisdiction and latent

want of jurisdiction.

(25) In P. Beatrice Perera vs. The Commissioner of National Housing 77 NLR 361 at page

366, the distinction between patent and latent want of jurisdiction was discussed as

follows,

. Lack of competency may arise in one of two ways. A court may lack jurisdiction

over the cause or the matter or over the parties; it may also lack competence because

of failure to comply with such procedural requirements as are necessary for the

exercise of power by the court. Both are jurisdictional defects; The first mentioned

of these is commonly known in the law as patent or total want of jurisdiction or

a defectus jurisdictionis and the second a latent or contingent want of jurisdiction

or defectus triationis. Both classes of jurisdictional defect result in judgments or

orders which are void. But an important difference must also be noted. In that class

of case where the want of jurisdiction is patent, no waiver of objection or

acquiescence can cure the want of jurisdiction; the reason for this being that to

permit the parties by their conduct to confer jurisdiction on a tribunal which has

none would be to admit a power in the parties to litigation to create new

11

jurisdictions or to extend a jurisdiction beyond its existing limits, both of which are

within the exclusive privilege of the legislature; the proceedings in cases within this

category are non coram judice and the want of jurisdiction is incurable. In other

class of case, where the want of jurisdiction is contingent only, the judgment or

order of the Court will be void only against the party on whom it operates but

acquiescence, waiver or inaction on the part of such person may estop him from

making or attempting to establish by evidence, any averment to the effect that the

Court was lacking in contingent jurisdiction

(26) This means that if a court labours under a patent want of jurisdiction, any objection

to the assumption of such jurisdiction can be raised before a higher court (either in

Appeal or Revision), even if the party raising that objection has failed to do so in the

first instance. (Kandy Omnibus Co Ltd vs. T.W. Roberts (1954) 56 NLR 293)

(27) However, Where a latent lack of jurisdiction exists, a party must raise these

procedural defects at the earliest opportunity as acquiescence, waiver or inaction

on the part of the party will estop that party from raising the objections in later

proceedings. Koraburuwane Hetitiarachchige Siri Bandula vs Koraburuwane

Hetitiarachchige Kithsiri Mahinatha and others. CA (PHC)152/2013 at page 7.

28) The territorial Jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court-is referred to in Section 128 of

the Criminal Procedure Code, which stipulates;

(1) Every offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by a court within the

local limits of whose jurisdiction it was committed.

(2) Any Magistrates Court within the local limits of the jurisdiction of which an

accused may be or be found shall have jurisdiction respectively in all cases of

offences otherwise within their respective jurisdictions which have been

committed on the territorial waters of Sri Lanka.

(3) An offence committed on the territorial waters of Sri Lanka to which subsection

(2) is not applicable or an offence committed on the high seas, or on board any

ship or upon any aircraft may be tried or inquired into by the Magistrates Court

of Colombo if it otherwise has jurisdiction or on indictment by High Court.

12

29) It is settled law that the lack of territorial jurisdiction of a court is a latent lack of

jurisdiction. In the case of Colombo Apothecaries Ltd. and Others vs Commissioner

of Labour (1998) 3 SLR 320, it was held that The lack of territorial jurisdiction of

court is a latent lack of jurisdiction curable by waiver or conduct of the party

seeking to attack the order of court on lack of jurisdiction.

30) Spencer Bower on the Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation 1966, 2nd

Edition, page 308, states;

So too when a party litigant , being in a position to object to that the matter in

difference is outside the local, pecuniary or other limits of jurisdiction of the

tribunal to which his adversary has resorted, deliberately elects to waive the

objection , and to proceed to the end as if no such objection existed , in the

expectation of obtaining a decision in his favour, he cannot be allowed, when this

expectation is not realized, to set up that the tribunal had no jurisdiction over the

cause or parties.

31) On the other hand, for an accused to succeed in appeal, the illegality or the

irregularity relied upon must be of a nature which meets the threshold laid down

in the proviso to Article 138 (1) of the Constitution, which states; that no judgment,

decree or order of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error,

defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties

or occasioned a failure of justice. In Sunil Jayarathna vs. Attorney General (2011)

2 Sri LR 91, the Supreme Court, in applying the proviso to Article 138 (1) of the

Constitution observed that;

Unless there is some grave miscarriage of justice it would not be appropriate to

interfere with the judgment of the trial judge who enters judgment after careful

consideration of the first-hand evidence put before her to which the Judges of the

Appellate Court would not have the ability to witness.

32) This principle, particularly in relation to territorial jurisdiction, is reflected in Section

434 of the Criminal Procedure Code which reads ;

13

Any judgment of any criminal court shall not be set aside merely on the ground

that the inquiry, trial, or other proceedings in the course of which it was passed

took place in the wrong local area unless it appears that such error occasioned a

failure of justice.

33) If a Magistrate is empowered by law to try an offence but the Court lacks territorial

jurisdiction to entertain the action, then it amounts to latent lack of jurisdiction as

it is a procedural error. In such an instance it is then open for the accused to raise

an objection at the earliest possible opportunity. If he fails to do so, the court will

assume jurisdiction. The accused cannot succeed by raising an objection with

respect to territorial jurisdiction on appeal, unless it is satisfied that the thresholds

laid down either in Article 138 (1) proviso to the constitution [prejudiced the

substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice] or Section 434 of

the CPC [error occasioned a failure of justice] are met.

34) It does not seem not possible to tie up the want of territorial jurisdiction with a

courts failure to administer justice. It is difficult to make a convincing argument

that there has been a miscarriage of justice because the action was instituted in a

Magistrates Court in the local limits of which the offence was NOT committed. As

observed in Sunil Jayarathna vs. Attorney General [supra], a trial judge makes a

decision after careful consideration of the first-hand evidence put before him. This

is even more evident in the case of a Magistrate who plays an active role in a

criminal trial to ascertain the truth.

35) Therefore, an argument brought up at a later stage of the action or even on appeal

that a Magistrates Court did not have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the

action cannot lead to the setting aside of a judgment delivered after careful

deliberation by a Magistrate empowered by law to try that particular offence. The

failure to comply with procedural law and the institution of an action in a court

empowered by law to adjudicate the issue although it does not have territorial

jurisdiction to entertain it, amounts only to latent lack of jurisdiction. If no objection

is raised, as in the case before us, at the earliest possible opportunity, then it is

deemed to have been waived and the court will assume jurisdiction.

14

For the reasons set out above, I answer the question of law in the negative and

accordingly the appeal is dismissed.
