JUDGMENT

Aluwihare PC. J,

(1) The Accused-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant [Hereinafter referred to as the

Accused] was indicted along with another before the High Court for the

murder of one Kodagodage Sunil Jayaweera [Hereinafter referred to as the

Deceased] on or about 9th May 1998.

(2) The trial before the High Court had proceeded only against the Accused as the

Attorney-General withdrew the indictment against the other accused who was

indicted along with the Accused-Appellant in the present case.

(3) At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court judge found the Accused

guilty as indicted, and accordingly the death sentence was imposed on him.

The Accused, aggrieved by the said judgement, moved by way of an appeal to

the Court of Appeal. By its judgement dated 14.02.2012, the Court of Appeal

dismissed the appeal, affirming the conviction and sentence imposed on the

Accused.

(4) The instant appeal arises out of the said judgement of the Court of Appeal. This

court granted special leave to appeal on the questions of law which are referred

to in sub-paragraphs (b), (e), (h), (j) and (k) of Paragraph 11 of the Petition of

the Accused-Appellant which are reproduced below;

(b) Whether their Lordships in the Court of Appeal have failed to consider that

in rejecting the evidence of the defence and accepting the version of the

prosecution witness, the learned High Court judge had required of the

defence the same burden of proof as required by the prosecution?

4

(e) Whether their Lordships in the Court of Appeal and the learned High Court

Judge have failed to fairly and properly evaluate the Defence evidence?

(h) Whether their Lordships in the Court of Appeal and the learned High Court

Judge have failed to consider the inconsistencies of the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses?

(J) Whether their Lordships in the Court of Appeal and the learned High Court

judge have failed to consider the evidence of the existence of a sudden

fight?

(k) Whether in all the circumstances of the case the petitioner should have

been acquitted of the count of murder or have been convicted of the lesser

offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder?

(5) Before the legal issues raised are addressed, it would be pertinent to lay down

the factual background to the incident that resulted in the death of the

deceased.

(6) In the course of the evidence led at the trial, it transpired that the deceased,

was living as a tenant, with his family in a small wattle and daub house

belonging to the father of the Accused.

(7) Sometime before the incident, the accused had got married and he had wanted

the deceased to vacate the premises as the accused intended to move in there

with his wife. It appears that the deceased had wanted three months to find

alternative accommodation.

(8) The deceased had not, however, moved out and on the day prior to the incident

on which the deceased died, the Accused had come to the house of the deceased

5

accompanied by another person and had caused damage to the structure of the

house when the deceased was out at work.

(9) Consequently, the deceased had complained to the police and who had

inquired into the Complaint. As no settlement could be reached between the

parties, the police had referred the matter to the Mediation Board but had

permitted the deceased to attend to the necessary repairs to damaged house.

(10) On the day following, whilst the deceased was engaged in attending to the re-

building of the damaged house, the Accused had arrived at the scene and had

attacked the deceased with a Manna knife and as a result he had succumbed

to the injuries.

(11) According to Dr. Dahanayake who carried out the autopsy, he had observed a

deep cut injury on the back of the neck, 25 cm in length which had completely

severed the brain stem and the Atlas vertebra, and the injury had been 10cm

in depth. The doctor has expressed the opinion that the injury referred to is

one that is necessarily fatal.

The Version of the Accused

(12) The Accused testifying under oath, in his examination-in-chief itself, admitted

that he attacked the deceased with a knife and that the deceased sustained an

injury as a result. According to the Accused, the deceased had been residing

there for about 13 years and about a year prior to the incident, he had asked

the deceased to vacate the house as he wished to move in there after his

marriage, however, the deceased had not acceded to his request.

6

(13) The accused also had admitted that, on the day before the incident he visited

the deceased and demanded vacant possession of the house. However, the

deceased again was not agreeable. Infuriated by this response the accused had

kicked the walls of the house, and as a result the walls had collapsed. Then,

both parties had gone to the police. As the police could not resolve the dispute,

they had referred the matter to the Mediation Board and had told the feuding

parties that the deceased should be permitted to continue occupying the

premises until such time the matter is inquired into by the Mediation Board. It

is also significant to note that the deceased had sought permission to re-erect

the walls and the accused said in his evidence that he agreed to allow the

deceased to repair the damage.

(14) In switching to an incident out of sequence, the Accused had said in his

testimony that the deceased suddenly grabbed a mamoty and as he got

frightened, in order to protect himself he picked a knife that was kept on the

roof of a nearby chicken coop and attacked the deceased. Then he says he fled

the area through fear and later surrendered to the police through his relatives.

(15) Under cross examination it was elicited, that the Accused had gone in the

direction where the deceased was living the day after the parties went to the

police over the housing dispute. The Accused had said that he saw the deceased

engaged in the process of re-building the house but had observed that the new

construction was larger than the one that existed, and he questioned the

deceased why so, having walked up to him. The deceased had been kneading

clay at the time. The accused, in his examination-in-chief, had said that the

deceased grabbed the mamoty and due to fear, he picked the knife and attacked

the deceased.

(16) The daughter of the deceased, Nilusha who had been a girl of 13 years at the

time had testified to the effect that both the Accused and another person had

come to their house on the previous day and toppled the posts that supported

7

the structure of the house and it collapsed. Her father had been out at work at

the time. On the day her father died, the family members were engaged in the

process of rebuilding. At one point, after kneading clay, her father had squatted

complaining that he is exhausted. She had also seen the Accused hovering in

the vicinity looking in the direction of the construction that was going on. At

one point, the accused had approached her father from behind and having

pulled out a knife which was tucked under his shirt, had dealt a blow on the

neck of her father. Apart from a solitary omission highlighted by the defence,

Nilushas testimony is free from any contradictions or any other infirmities.

(17) The wife of the deceased Vinitha had also testified, but she had not witnessed

the attack on her husband as she had gone to fetch water and only had rushed

to the scene on hearing the cries of distress of her daughter Nilusha.

The Issues raised on Behalf of the Accused

(18) It was contended on behalf of the Accused that both the learned High Court

Judge as well as the Court of Appeal failed to consider the applicability of

special exceptions to the Section 294 of the Penal Code, namely grave and

sudden provocation and/or sudden fight. It was the contention of the learned

Presidents Counsel that there was evidence emanating from the testimony of

the prosecution witnesses of a sudden fight.

(19) It was further contended that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider

the omission in the testimony of the sole eyewitness, Nilusha, who testified on

behalf of the prosecution. It was pointed out that, although Nilusha in her

evidence had stated that the accused pulled out a knife that was tucked behind

his shirt, she had not stated this fact either in her statement to the police or the

depositions she made at the non-summery inquiry.

8

(20) Considering the fact that the witness [Nilusha] was a child of 13 years at the

time she made the statements, it is possible that due to her tender age, she may

not have been mature enough to appreciate the significance of that fact, at the

time she made the statements. In addition, she would have been a distressed

child having lost her father. In this context, I am of the view that the omission

referred to is not of such gravity to discredit the testimony of Nilusha. As

referred to earlier, other than this omission, her evidence had been consistent

and remains un-impugned.

The Questions of Law

(21) Before dealing with the questions of law, it is necessary to bear in mind the

Constitutional provision embodied in the proviso to Article 138(1) which

reads;

Provided that no judgement decree or order of any court shall be reversed or

varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

[Emphasis added]

(22) In view of the constitutional provision referred to, which is in mandatory

terms, the duty cast on the Court of Appeal would be to consider the appeal

within the scope of the proviso and, this court in turn, would be required to

consider whether the Court of Appeal and/or the High Court were in error in

coming to the conclusions, notwithstanding that the Accused had satisfied that

his substantial rights have been prejudiced or the error or the defect relied on

by the Accused had occasioned a failure of justice.

(23) Similar thresholds are found in the proviso to Section 334(1) and Section 436

of the Code of Criminal procedure Act No.15 of 1979 which stipulate that

notwithstanding the fact that the point raised in appeal might be decided in

9

favour of the Appellant, the court can dismiss the appeal if it is of the opinion

that no substantial miscarriage/failure of justice has in fact occurred.

(24) The legal effect of these two provisions which are applicable to criminal

appeals, in my opinion, would be that, in order to succeed in his appeal, it is

not sufficient for an accused to merely impress upon court that the issue raised

might be decided in favour of the Accused. The accused must also satisfy court

that a substantial miscarriage of justice has in fact occurred or that the decision

had occasioned a failure of justice.

(25) In relation to the question of law referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph

11 of the Petition of the Accused, it was submitted that the Court of Appeal

failed to consider the fact that the learned High Court judge had placed the

same burden of proof on both the prosecution as well as the defence. It was

pointed out that the burden on the prosecution to establish the charges is

beyond reasonable doubt whereas as it is not so in case of the defence.

(26) In explaining the conduct of the Accused, in the course of the submissions, it

was pointed out that the situation was such that the Accused acted in self-

defence. In considering the defence raised on behalf of the Accused, the learned

trial judge had referred to the applicable legal principles on the burden of

proof cast on an accused in a criminal case in relation to establishing a

defence [Page 8 of the judgement]. The Trial Judge had gone on to state that

the burden [on an accused] is on a balance of probability and also had

referred to the fact that even in instances where the defence raised fails to

reach that threshold, if a reasonable doubt arises from the prosecution case,

the accused would be entitled to the benefit of the doubt. The learned trial

judge had also referred to the fact that, even if the defence version is totally

rejected, still the prosecution cannot succeed, unless it proves the case beyond

reasonable doubt.

(28) The passage in the judgement referred to above not only demonstrates that the

learned trial judge had been alive to the relevant principles on burden of proof

and this court wishes to observe that the learned trial judge had not erred in

that regard, particularly in relation to the burden of proof cast on an accused

in establishing a special exception under Section 294 of the Penal Code.

(29) Considering the above, it cannot be said that the learned High Court Judge had

placed the same burden of proof on both the prosecution and the defence.

When the question of law raised on behalf of the Accused is viewed in the light

of the observations made by the learned High Court Judge referred to above, I

answer the question of law referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 11

of the petition in the negative.

(30) The next question of law [sub paragraph (e) of paragraph 11] on which special

leave was granted was whether the Court of Appeal and the High Court failed

to evaluate the defence version properly and fairly.

(31) As referred to earlier, there is no dispute that the injury that resulted in the

death of the deceased was inflicted by the Accused. The only question that this

11

court has to address is whether the injury was caused at a time the accused

was deprived of the power of self-control due to grave and sudden provocation

offered by the deceased.

(32) From the evidence led in the course of the trial, it is quite evident that the

deceased had acted with considerable restraint throughout the incident, in the

context of what he faced at the hands of the Accused. In his absence, his house

where he lived with his young family was demolished by the accused and

another. This was not denied by the Accused either.

(33) The only action the Deceased took was to seek the assistance of the law

enforcement by lodging a complaint with the police, an action any law-abiding

citizen would resort to in the face of an adversary of this nature. At the police

inquiry he requested that he be given permission to rebuild his house, the

request which the Accused acceded to.

(34) The following day, the deceased with the help of his family members were

engaged in the process of rebuilding the damaged house, and even when they

saw the Accused hovering in the vicinity, there is nothing to say that the

deceased acted in any manner that would have provoked the Accused.

(35) According to the Accuseds own evidence, it was he who approached the

Deceased and questioned him. The fact remains that the deceased had had no

dealings with the Accused, the reason being it was the father of the Accused

who was the landlord, he had not interfered with the peaceful occupation of

the premises.

(36) In the backdrop of the events that took place on the previous day, which ended

with the Deceased and the Accused having to attend the police station, the

Accused ought not to have disturbed the deceased who was in the process of

rebuilding his house and if he had any issue with the way the house was being

12

put up by the deceased, the Accused could easily have lodged a complaint with

the police rather than confronting him.

(37) The gravamen of the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel was that the

learned Trial Judge failed to consider whether the Accused acted under grave

and sudden provocation and in addition, the Trial Judge ought to have

considered whether the deceased sustained the injury in the course of a sudden

fight.

(38) The Accused did say in his evidence that when he questioned the Deceased as

to why he was putting up a building that was larger than the one that was

destroyed, the deceased became abusive and he supposed to have retorted;

I do not do things the way you want. I will build the house the way I want.

[ . ].

(39) In addition to the mitigatory exception of grave and sudden provocation, the

learned Presidents Counsel also argued that both the learned High Court Judge

and the Court of Appeal failed to consider the special exception 4 of Section

294 of the Penal code, namely whether the act of causing the fatal injury was

committed in a sudden fight. The Presidents Counsel argued that the evidence

unfolded in the course of the trial provided the existence of circumstances to

bring the case within the ambit of the two exceptions referred to.

(40) In view of the contrasting versions of the prosecution and the defence, as to

how the attack on the deceased took place, it would be necessary to consider

the legal burden cast on the accused to establish his version, if he is to succeed

in his mitigatory defences referred to above.

(41) Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance delineates the burden of proving the

existence of circumstances bringing a case within the ambit of special

exceptions of the Penal Code and states;

13

When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the

existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general

exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso

contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the

offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such

circumstances.

The illustration (b) of that section sheds further light as to the burden of proof

and reads;

A, accused of murder, alleges that, by grave and sudden provocation, he

was deprived of the power of self-control. The burden of proof is on A.

(42) In the case of James Chandrasekera v. The King 44 NLR 97, seven judges of the

Court of Criminal Appeal considered this issue in depth and held,

Where, in a case in which any general or special exception under the

Penal Code is pleaded by an accused person and the evidence relied upon

by such accused person fails to satisfy the Jury affirmatively of the existence

of circumstances bringing the case within the exception pleaded, the

accused is not entitled to be acquitted if, upon a consideration of the

evidence as a whole, a reasonable doubt is created in the minds of the Jury

as to whether he is entitled to the benefit of the exception pleaded.

(43) The majority of the judges, [de Kretser J dissenting], in the case of

Chandrasekera [supra] held that, in a case where a general or special exception

under the Penal Code is pleaded, a reasonable doubt being created in the minds

of the jury, as to the applicability of the exception, does not render the accused

entitled to its benefit. Dr. G.L. Peiris expresses the view that the relevant

provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, read with the majority judgment in

James Chandrasekera [supra] have the effect that the plea of grave and sudden

provocation is required to be established by the accused on a balance of

14

probability [Offences under the Penal Code of Ceylon, first edition at pgs.,

102-103].

(44) Thus, the law as it stands today is that, where in a case in which any general

or special exception under the Penal Code is pleaded by an accused person and

the evidence relied upon by such accused person fails to satisfy the court

affirmatively of the existence of circumstances bringing the case within the

exception pleaded, the accused is not entitled to relief if, upon a consideration

of the evidence as a whole, a reasonable doubt is created as to whether he is

entitled to the benefit of the exception pleaded.

(45) Along with the decisions of King v. Coomaraswamy 41 NLR 289, King v.

Kirigoris 48 NLR 407 and Regina v. Piyasena 57 NLR 226 relied on by the

learned Presidents Counsel, the decision in the case of James v. The Queen 53

NLR 401 was also considered. The main issue that confronts us in the instant

case is, even if the version of the accused is believed [which the learned High

Court Judge had rejected] would the alleged provocation, satisfy the objective

norms postulated by the law. In the case of James [supra] the Court observed

that;

He [accused] must in addition, establish that such provocation, objectively

assessed, was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from

amounting to murder. That depends upon the actual effect of the

provocation upon the person provoked and upon the probability of its

producing a similar effect upon other persons.

In the same case Justice Gratiaen went on to state;

On grounds of public policy, the Legislature which enacted Exception 1 to

section 294 designedly denies the mitigatory plea of "grave and sudden

provocation" to a prisoner whose reaction to provocation in any particular

case falls short of the minimum standard of self-control which can

15

reasonably be expected from an average person of ordinary habits, placed

in a similar situation, who belongs to the same class of society as the

prisoner does.

(46) In the context of the case, I find the Accused cannot benefit from the mitigatory

defence of provocation due to two reasons;

Firstly, even assuming the deceased uttered the alleged provocative words, still

they do not meet the objective norms of the exception.

Secondly, the benefit of the exception is denied to a person who seeks

provocation or where the offender voluntarily provokes, as an excuse for the

retaliation.

(47) The facts of the case, in my view did not warrant the consideration of either

the exception of provocation or sudden fight and in the circumstances the

questions of law referred to in sub-paragraph (e) [evaluation of defence

evidence], sub-paragraph (j) [failure to consider evidence of the existence of a

sudden fight] and the consequential question of whether in the circumstances

of the case the accused should have been convicted of the lesser offence of

culpable homicide not amounting to murder, referred to in sub-paragraph (k)

of paragraph 11 of the Petition are also answered in the negative.

(48) The learned Presidents Counsel also argued that the learned High Court Judge

had failed to consider the inconsistencies of the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses. [Question of law referred to in sub paragraph (b) of Paragraph 11

of the Petition]. Apart from the omission relating to the act of the Accused

pulling out the knife tucked under his shirt, there are no major inconsistencies

in the testimony of the sole eyewitness Nilusha. I have dealt with the testimony

of Nilusha in detail in paragraphs (19) and (20) of this judgement and I do not

wish to refer to my findings again.

16

(49) It was pointed out on behalf of the Accused that the wife of the deceased was

contradicted by a statement she made at the inquest which was indicative of a

sudden fight which was not considered by the learned Trial judge. Witness

Vinitha was categorical in her evidence that she saw the Accused in the

vicinity, but she did not see the Accused speaking to the deceased. She also

rejected the suggestion put to her that her husband spoke to the Accused in a

provocative manner. It was pointed out, however, that at the inquest

proceedings she had said then he [meaning the accused] was talking to my

husband. The eyewitness Nilusha was also cross examined as to whether there

was an exchange of words between the Accused and the deceased to which she

answered in the negative. I am of the view that when the contradictory

statement referred to is considered with the rest of the evidence, it would not

be possible to draw the inference that there was an exchange of words that led

to a sudden fight. Accordingly, I answer this question of law [Sub paragraph

(b)] also in the negative.

(50) Having considered the evidence led at the trial, I am of the view that the

learned High Court Judge was justified in accepting the evidence of witness

Nilusha and acting on the same. When one considers the totality of the

evidence of this case, the accused had failed to discharge the evidentiary

burden cast on him in terms of Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance to bring

his case within the ambit of the special exceptions to Section 294 of the Penal

Code and the learned High Court Judge cannot be faulted for not acting on the

evidence of the Accused.

(51) I am further of the view that the grounds urged on behalf of the Accused are

not sufficient to mitigate the conviction of murder to that of culpable homicide

not amounting to murder, and I hold that neither the learned High Court Judge

nor the Court of Appeal erred in arriving at the conclusion that the accused

was guilty of the offence of murder.

17

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence imposed on the Accused is

affirmed and the appeal is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
