"A
s stated earlier, in terms of section 21 of Act No. 31 of 2013, the amendments made to"
"the principal enactment (SLE Act, No. 20 of 2009) by provisions of the amending Act"
"shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on 8th April 2009. Therefore,"
"the two exemptions stated above contained in the proviso to section 43(2) with regard to"
"the requirement to follow the legislative scheme contained in section 43(2) would not be"
"applicable, only if either the approval by the Cabinet of Ministers or a permit issued"
"under section 18 of the SLSEA Act had been obtained prior to 8th April 2009. In the"
"instant case, as at 8th April 2009, neither the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers nor a"
"permit under section 18 of the SLSEA Act had been obtained for the project proposed"
"by the Petitioner. Therefore, the proviso to subsection 43(2) would have no applicability"
"to the instant case. Thus, it was incumbent on the transmission licensee – CEB to have"
"complied with the procedural requirement contained in subsection 43(2). Neither party"
"has placed before this Court any evidence in that regard. Nor has either party alleged"
"that the 1st Respondent – CEB had failed to comply with subsection 43(2) of the SLE Act."
