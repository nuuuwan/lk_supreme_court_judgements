"(iv)","Upon the Petitioner submitting to the 2nd Respondent – SLSEA proof of the"
"","satisfaction of the conditions contained in the ‘provisional approval’"
"","including the afore-stated ‘Letter of Intent’, the 2nd Respondent shall within"
"","one month of the submission of such material, process the Application of the"
"","Petitioner in accordance with the law and the relevant provisions of the"
"","Guide (“P2C”), and issue a permit to the Petitioner under and in terms of"
"","section 18 of the SLSEA Act."
"(v)","I am acutely conscious that this infringement would have resulted in"
"","considerable financial loss to the Petitioner, which this Court is regrettably"
"","though, compelled not to fully compensate. Providing reparation for loss of"
"","profit suffered by the Petitioner arising out of the infringement of"
"","fundamental rights would be quite justified in the circumstances of this case."
"","However, I am sensitive to the fact that making such an order for full"
"","reparation will only result in the Consolidated Fund having to bear such"
"","burden, which would eventually result in the tax paying public having to"
"","suffer further hardships."
"","However, the attendant circumstances of this case require this Court to make"
"","an order for the payment of a significant amount of damages. Such an order"
"","should have a deterrent effect on not only the 1st and the 2nd Respondents, the"
"","state as well. Therefore, I direct that the 1st Respondent who has been"
"","primarily responsible for the infringement of the fundamental rights of the"
"","Petitioner, shall pay the Petitioner a sum of Rs. 1,000,000.00 as damages."
"(vi)","Since the 1st Respondent through its officials has been primarily responsible"
"","for the infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner, it would be"
"","the responsibility of the state to identify such individual officials of the 1st"
"","Respondent – CEB, and take appropriate action against them. This is a matter"
