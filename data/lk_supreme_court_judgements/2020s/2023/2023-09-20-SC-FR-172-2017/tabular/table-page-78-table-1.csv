"I
n view of the foregoing circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that the ‘technical"
"reasons’ cited by the 4th Respondent were in fact not the actual reason for the refusal on"
"the part of the 1st Respondent – CEB to issue the ‘Letter of Intent’ to the Petitioner. The"
"conduct of the CEB in granting ‘grid interconnection concurrence’ in May 2016 clearly"
"shows that by that time the CEB had cleared whatever technical issues there may have"
"been and the proposed project of the Petitioner was of such nature that electricity"
"generated by it could be supplied to the national grid without encountering any"
"technical glitch. Thus, the said purported ‘technical reasons’ cannot be accepted as valid"
"grounds to refuse granting any relief to the Petitioner."
