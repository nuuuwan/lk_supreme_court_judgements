"Justice Prasanna Jayawardane adopted the wider approach taken in Dayarathna case."
"His Lordship was of the view that a court is not confined in cases of substantive"
"legitimate expectations, to reviewing the public authority’s decision on the traditional"
"test of unreasonableness described in the Wednesbury case. His Lordship identified that"
"the test of Wednesbury unreasonableness is adequate in a case where there is a single"
"exercise of power by a public authority. However, in a case where the petitioner claims"
"a substantive legitimate expectation, there is a dual exercise of power and that his case"
"is linked to both exercises of power. If a court confined itself to the test in Wednesbury,"
"Justice Jayawardena expressed the view that the court would only be reviewing the"
"second exercise of power, by asking whether it is unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense."
"He held that a court considering judicial review must consider and evaluate both"
"competing interests, i.e. the assurance which created the expectation, and the reasons"
"for the public authority’s change of policy or decision which resulted in the negation of"
"that expectation. His view was that considering only one of the two competing interests,"
"would place the court in ‘abhorrent realm of inequity’."
