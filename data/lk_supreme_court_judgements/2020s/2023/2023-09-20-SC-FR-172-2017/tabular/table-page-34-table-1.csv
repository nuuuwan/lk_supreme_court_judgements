"In R. v. Department of Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie [(2000) 1 WLR"
"1115], court observed that as the representations cited by the claimant had been made"
"by certain politicians who were not officials of the relevant public authority, and though"
"such representations would have given rise to an ‘expectation’ as claimed by the"
"claimant, such expectation cannot be recognized as a ‘legitimate expectation’ which can"
"be protected by law, and therefore, relief cannot be granted founded on the doctrine of"
"legitimate expectations. Quoting from the GCHQ judgment, the court held that"
"“legitimate or reasonable expectation may arise either from an express promise given on behalf of"
"a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably"
"expect to continue”."
