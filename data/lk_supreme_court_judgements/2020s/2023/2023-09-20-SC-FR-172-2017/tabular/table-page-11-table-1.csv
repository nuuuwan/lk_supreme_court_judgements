"An examination of the provisions of the SLE Act reveals that, a permit issued by the"
"SLSEA in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act by itself would not confer sufficient legal"
"authorisation for a project proponent to commission an on-grid renewable energy"
"project and commence generating electricity. A project proponent needs to obtain an"
"electricity generation license from the PUCSL (referred to as a ‘generation license’),"
"which the PUCSL is entitled to issue in terms of section 7(1) of the SLE Act. However, it"
"is important to note that, in so far as renewable energy-based electricity generation"
"plants are concerned, a condition precedent to applying to the PUCSL seeking an"
"electricity generation license, is the obtaining of a permit from the SLSEA, issued under"
"section 18 of the SLSEA Act. Thus, it would be seen that the law contemplates a two-"
"tiered process for the grant of approval for an on-grid renewable energy-based"
"electricity generation project. First, approval by the SLSEA and a permit. Secondly,"
"approval by the PUCSL and a license. As was shown earlier, the CEB is involved in the"
"grant of ‘provisional approval’ and ‘final approval’ and a permit by the SLSEA under"
"section 18 of the SLSEA Act. As would be seen hereinafter, the CEB becomes once again"
"involved in the grant of a generation license by the PUCSL. Thus, approval by the CEB"
"is critical."
