"","n response to the allegation pertaining to the non-granting of the ‘Letter of Intent’ to"
"the Petitioner, the 4th Respondent has taken up the following positions:",""
"(i)","Due to technical reasons that are common or specific to Solar PV and Wind"
"","Power electricity generation plants, the 1st Respondent has stopped issuing"
"","‘Letters of Intent’. There are constraints in interconnection of these power"
"","plants to the transmission system. Therefore, in 2012, the 1st Respondent did"
"","not issue to the 2nd Respondent (SLSEA) concurrence for grid interconnection"
"","in respect of the project of the Petitioner. However, with grid and system"
"","expansion, these constraints can be relaxed or changed."
"(ii)","The 1st Respondent (CEB) stopped issuing ‘Letters of Intent’ to wind and solar"
"","projects until the grid connection limitations and effects on the system were"
"","studied. A study in this regard was conducted by the 1st Respondent and its"
"","report is contained in the “Integration of non-conventional renewable energy-"
"","based generation into Sri Lanka Power-Grids”. (“4R1”) According to this"
"","study, only 10 MW solar projects have been considered viable for Vavuniya."
"(iii)","Following the amendment to the SLE Act by Act No. 31 of 2013, procurement"
"","of electricity should be done on a competitive basis. This encourages lower"
"","electricity cost, ultimately helping customers and the national economy."
"(iv)","The Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy has decided on a policy of"
"","calling for tenders for wind and solar power projects."
"(v)","No ‘Letter of Intent’ has been issued since August 2013, except for one"
"","project, that being a joint venture between a private project proponent and"
"","the CEB."
