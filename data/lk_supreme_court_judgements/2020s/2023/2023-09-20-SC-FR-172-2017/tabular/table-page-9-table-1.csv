"The practice followed by the SLSEA is that prior to submitting an Application to the"
"PAC, the SLSEA obtains grid concurrence of the CEB. This stage is referred to as the"
"stage where the SLSEA obtains from the CEB, ‘grid interconnection concurrence‘. This"
"process involves the CEB examining the proposed project and considering whether it"
"would be technically feasible for the CEB to receive into the national electricity grid,"
"electricity generated by the project. It is important to note that the 1st Respondent – CEB"
"is represented at the PAC and hence is in a position to take cognizance of the"
"submission of an Application by a project proponent and also submit its views at a"
"meeting of the PAC towards the decision of the 2nd Respondent – SLSEA on whether or"
"not ‘provisional approval’ should be granted to a particular applicant."
"The PAC is an entity recognized by the Act and in terms of section 10, comprises of a"
"number of ex-officio officials, including the General-Manager of the CEB and"
"representatives of several other statutory bodies of the State performing functions"
"relevant to renewable energy projects. It is the PAC that is empowered to, on behalf of"
"the SLSEA grant ‘provisional approval’ and ‘final approval’ to an Application seeking"
"authorization (a permit) to commission a renewable energy based on-grid electricity"
"generation plant."
