"","he sub-doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations arises in the following two"
"situations:",""
"(i)","A person who had been enjoying a benefit or advantage over a period of time,"
"","claims that such advantage or benefit had been withdrawn in frustration of"
"","his substantive legitimate expectation that the advantage or benefit will"
"","continue. In this instance, the recognition of the substantive legitimate"
"","expectation will preclude the decision-maker from exercising discretionary"
"","authority and changing the outcome legitimately expected by the party which"
"","entertained the expectation."
"(ii)","A person who is not presently enjoying a particular benefit or an advantage,"
"","claims that while he rightfully expected such benefit or advantage to be"
"","granted, in frustration of his expectation, the benefit or advantage he had"
"","applied for has been denied. In this instance too, the recognition of the"
"","substantive legitimate expectation will force the decision-maker to grant the"
"","particular benefit or advantage that was rightfully expected by such party."
"","[The instant case falls into this category.]"
