"(b) in this regard, the following paragraph in the Guidelines (“P2C”) is of great"
"relevance."
"“As the single buyer of electricity produced by the NRE project, CEB Transmission and"
"Bulk Supply Licensee will have to be satisfied with its ability to accept electricity"
"produced by the proposed project. This will be based on careful evaluation of system wide"
"impacts, network typology and system stability, in addition to the more commonly"
"understood constraints such as local transmission grid limitations and grid substation"
"capacity limitations. SEA will consult CEB in this regard upon receiving a complete"
"application, before presenting it to the PAC for Provisional Approval. Hence the absence"
"of the concurrence of CEB to grid connect the proposed project will result in refusal of"
"provisional approval.” (Section 2.3, ‘Concurrence of the CEB’, page 8 of “P2C”)"
