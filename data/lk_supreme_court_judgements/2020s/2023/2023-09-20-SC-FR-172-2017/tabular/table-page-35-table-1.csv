"A
s to legitimacy of the expectation arising out of a representation made or past practice"
"of a public authority, the law is concerned only of the expectation the person concerned"
"is entitled to develop, as opposed to the subjective expectation actually entertained in"
"the mind of such person. Thus, the question to be asked is, what was the expectation the"
"person concerned was entitled by law to develop in his mind by the representation or"
"the conduct of the public authority concerned. Once the court identifies the legitimacy"
"of the expectation generated by the public authority, the court needs to identify how"
"that expectation needs to be protected, having regard to the competing interests of"
"protecting discretionary freedom of the public authority versus maintaining legal"
"certainty of its decisions."
