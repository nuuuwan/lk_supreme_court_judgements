"Albeit brief, the complaint of the Petitioner is that in April 2012 it presented to the 2nd"
"Respondent – Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (hereinafter sometimes referred"
"to as “the SLSEA”), an Application seeking approval to commission and operate a solar"
"power electricity generation plant in Vavuniya. In May 2016, provisional approval for"
"the project was granted by the 2nd Respondent. However, subsequently, as a result of a"
"‘Letter of Intent’ not being granted by the 1st Respondent – Ceylon Electricity Board"
"(hereinafter sometimes referred to as “the CEB”) indicating its intent to purchase"
"electricity generated from the proposed plant, the Petitioner company did not receive"
"the permit applied for from the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner’s position is that in view"
"of the ‘provisional approval’ it received from the 2nd Respondent, it entertained a"
"‘legitimate expectation’ that it will receive a ‘Letter of Intent’ from the 1st Respondent"
"(as it had previously obtained ‘grid interconnection concurrence’ from the 1st"
"Respondent and had complied with all the other conditions laid down in the"
"‘provisional approval’) and thereafter, a permit be issued in terms of section 18 of the"
"Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act, to enable it to proceed with the project,"
"commission the electricity generation plant in order to  provide electricity to the"
"national grid by selling such electricity to the CEB, and thereby secure its commercial"
"objectives."
