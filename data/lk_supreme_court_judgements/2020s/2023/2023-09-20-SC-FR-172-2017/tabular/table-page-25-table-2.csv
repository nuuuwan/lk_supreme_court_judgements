"in the recognition of a doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations. Justice Taylor’s"
"words in this regard were as follows:"
"“…I conclude that the doctrine of legitimate expectation in essence imposes a duty to act"
"fairly. While most of the cases are concerned…with a right to be heard, I do not think the"
"doctrine is so confined. Indeed, in a case where ex hypothesi there is no right to be heard,"
"it may be thought the more important to fair dealing that a promise or undertaking given"
"by a minister as to how he will proceed should be kept. Of course, such promise or"
"undertaking must not conflict with his statutory duty or his duty, as here, in the exercise"
"of a prerogative power.”"
