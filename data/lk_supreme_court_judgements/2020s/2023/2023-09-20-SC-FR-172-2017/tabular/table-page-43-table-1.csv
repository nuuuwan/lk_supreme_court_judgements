"T
he concept of legal certainty provides a major justification for the recognition and"
"enforcement of substantive legitimate expectations. As stated earlier, legal certainty is a"
"component of the rule of law. The legal protection of expectations through the"
"application of principles of administrative law such as the doctrine of legitimate"
"expectations is a way of giving expression to the requirements of predictability,"
"certainty, formal equality, fairness and consistency, which are all facets inherent in the"
"rule of law, thus, its importance. However, legal certainty should be balanced with wider"
"public interest. What will ultimately be sanctioned by court is what is in public interest."
