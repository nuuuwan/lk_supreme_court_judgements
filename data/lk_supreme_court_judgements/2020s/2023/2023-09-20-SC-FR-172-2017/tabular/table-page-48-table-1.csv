"3.8.5 Does the frustration of a legitimate expectation constitute an infringement of"
"Article 12(1)?"
"The totality of the judicial precedent cited in this judgment and the available"
"jurisprudence both in this country and found in English Law pertaining to the doctrine"
"of legitimate expectations (both procedural and substantive) points towards one"
"direction. That is the conceptual basis for judicial review of the impugned decision, that"
"being the rationale that permitting the impugned decision to stand would be"
"inconsistent with rule of law, overlooking an instance of abuse of power, allowing an"
"unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious decision to stand, and contrary to the very"
"foundation of the law – that being fairness. Time and again, this Court has observed"
"that the recognition of the equal protection of the law – the right to equality would"
"necessitate this Court to rule that such legally flawed decisions which are contrary to"
"the rule of law, signify an instance of abuse of power, are irrational, capricious or"
"arbitrary or are so fundamentally unfair that the very foundations of justice and the"
"conscience of the court would be shockingly shaken, would amount to an infringement"
"of that fundamental right recognized by Article 12 of the Constitution. Thus, the"
"frustration of a legitimate expectation does amount to infringement of Article 12 and"
"specifically Article 12(1). This view on the impact of the frustration of a legitimate"
"expectation is recognized amongst others in Suranganie Marapana v. The Bank of"
"Ceylon and Others [(1997) 3 Sri L.R. 156], Dayarathna and Others v. Minister of Health"
"and Indigenous Medicine and Others (referred to above), Gunawardena v. Ceylon"
"Petroleum Corporation and Others [(2001) 1 Sri L.R. 231], Weerasekara v. Director-"
"General of Health Services and Others [(2003) 1 Sri L.R. 295], Sirimal and Others v."
"Board of Directors of the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment and Others (referred to"
"above), Fernando and Others v. Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd and Others"
"[(2006) 3 Sri L.R. 141], and M.R.C.C. Ariyarathne and Others v. N.K. Illangakoon, IGP"
"and Others (referred to above). Thus, it is now necessary to conclude that the ‘frustration"
"of a procedural or substantive legitimate expectation’ is a sui generis ground to hold that"
