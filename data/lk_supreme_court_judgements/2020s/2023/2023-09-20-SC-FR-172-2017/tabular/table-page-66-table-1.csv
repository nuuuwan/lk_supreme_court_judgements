"6.  Submissions made on behalf of the Respondents"
"On behalf of the Respondents, it was submitted by the learned Solicitor General that the"
"instant Application alleging an infringement of the Fundamental Rights of the"
"Petitioner, had been filed prematurely. He submitted that, initially a period of six"
"months was given by the SLSEA for the Petitioner to comply with the conditions that"
"were attached to the ‘provisional approval’ (which was issued on 19th May 2016)."
"Subsequently, on a request made by the Petitioner, this period of time was extended by"
"another six months. Accordingly, the extended period granted to the Petitioner to"
"comply with the requirements was to end on 18th May 2017. Had the Petitioner failed to"
"satisfy the conditions that were attached to the ‘provisional approval’ at the time of the"
"expiry of this extended period, in terms of section 17(4) of the SLSEA Act, the"
"‘provisional approval’ granted to the Petitioner would have lapsed. This Application"
"has been submitted to the Supreme Court on 15th May 2017, three days before the"
"extended period was to have lapsed. Learned Solicitor General submitted that the"
"Petitioner resorted to this move, in order to prevent the ‘provisional approval’ from"
"lapsing. Therefore, he submitted that the instant Application had been filed to prevent"
"the provisional approval from automatically lapsing and was also premature."
