"7.7 Is the Petitioner entitled to any relief and if so, what reliefs should the Petitioner be"
"entitled to?"
"Where a substantive legitimate expectation of a claimant has been frustrated by a"
"decision-maker for a reason that is not in wider public interest justiciable, and the"
"impugned decision is either perverse or irrational, the Court will and should not"
"refrain from intervening in granting substantive protection to the claimant. Relief of"
"substantive character should be granted in instances where the impugned decision"
"has been taken contrary to expectations the public authority has generated and is"
"therefore unlawful, and thus amounts to an abuse of power. It would also be"
"available in instances where the change in policy, applicable criteria and procedure"
"is not objectively and rationally aimed at serving wider public interests and is not"
"proportionate to the intended goal of serving public interests."
