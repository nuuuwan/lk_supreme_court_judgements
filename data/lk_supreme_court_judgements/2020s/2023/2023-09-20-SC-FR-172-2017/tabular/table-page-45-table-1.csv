"In R (Nadarajah) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [(2005), EWCA Civil"
"1363], it was held that, a public body’s promise or past practice as to future conduct"
"may be denied, in circumstances where to do so is the public body’s legal duty, or is"
"otherwise, to use a now familiar vocabulary, a proportionate response (of which the"
"court is the judge, or the last judge) having regard to a legitimate aim pursued by the"
"public body in the public interest. The principle that good administration requires"
"public authorities to be held to their promises would be undermined if the law did not"
"insist that any failure or refusal to comply is objectively justified as a proportionate"
"measure in the circumstances."
