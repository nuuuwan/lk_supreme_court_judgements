"Since the Coughlan case, the intensity with which courts have considered whether there"
"existed a substantive legitimate expectation, has decreased. There exists only a very"
"small category of cases where the stringent proportionality / balancing test applies. In"
"those cases, the public authority can (is entitled to) frustrate the substantive legitimate"
"expectation it created, only if the court is satisfied that the public interest in doing so"
"(deviating from the undertaking given) outweighs the unfairness that will thereby be"
"occasioned to the individual concerned. In such cases, a decision to frustrate a"
"substantive legitimate expectation will be held to be lawful provided the decision-"
"maker has (i) taken the expectation into account as part of its decision-making process,"
"(ii) reached a reasonable conclusion concerning the balance between the public and"
"private interests at stake, and (iii) respected any relevant conditions precedent, such as"
"having given due notice where it would be unfair not to do so. Unless these grounds are"
"satisfied, the public authority concerned will be required by court to honour its own"
"undertaking / representations and its part practices."
