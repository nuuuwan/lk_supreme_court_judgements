"claimant. This is seen in Wickremaratne v Jayaratne and another [(2001) 3 Sri L.R. 161],"
"where Justice U. De Z. Gunawardane held as follows:"
"“…In this case the petitioner’s interest lay in some ultimate benefit which he hoped to"
"attain or possibly retain… It is felt that acting to one’s detriment in reliance upon a"
"promise or undertaking given by a public authority or anyone else can strengthen or add"
"to the weight of the legitimate expectation induced thereby, in such a situation, therefore,"
"the counterbalancing public interest should be weightier than in a case where there had"
"been no such detrimental reliance…”"
