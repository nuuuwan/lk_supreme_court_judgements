"I
n Sundarkaran v. Bharathi and Others [(1989) 1 Sri LR 46], the Petitioner – Appellant"
"had a liquour license for the two preceding years, and applied for a license for the"
"following year (1987). He was required by the relevant authorities to pay the license fee."
"When he attempted to do so at the office of the Government Agent, he was informed"
"that a license could not be issued to him as he had failed to obtain the consent of all the"
"Members of Parliament of the area, which was a requirement in terms of a circular"
"issued in 1986 (which became applicable for the first time). He moved for a writ of"
"Mandamus from the Court of Appeal, and having failed, appealed to this Court. This"
"Court observed that the Respondents had failed to give the Petitioner a fair hearing of"
"meeting the objections raised by the Members of Parliament. Court also held that, it has"
"been repeatedly recognized that no man is to be deprived of his property without"
"having an opportunity of being heard. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that"
"the Petitioner was merely ‘hoping against hope’ of being granted a renewal of his"
"license and held that he had a legitimate expectation of success, and therefore a right to"
"a full and fair opportunity of being heard."
