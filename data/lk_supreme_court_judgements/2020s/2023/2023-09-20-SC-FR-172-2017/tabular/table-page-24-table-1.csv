"L
ord Diplock observed that to qualify for judicial review, the impugned decision must"
"have consequences which affect some person other than the decision-maker, though it"
"can affect the decision-maker as well. It must affect the other person (claimant), either"
"(a) by altering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable by or against"
"him in private law, or (b) deprive him of some benefit or advantage which either (i) he"
"had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can"
"legitimately be expected to be permitted to continue until some rational ground for"
"withdrawing it had been communicated to him, and he had been given an opportunity"
"to comment, or (ii) he has received an assurance from the decision-maker that the"
"benefit or advantage will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of"
"advancing reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn. [It is category (b)"
"that can be referred to as giving rise to an ‘legitimate expectation’.]"
