"Subsequently,  the  Petitioner  had  obtained  all  the  required  approvals  as  contained  in"
"Annexure I of “P5A”, except the “Letter of Intent” from the CEB. The Petitioner produced"
"marked  “P6A”  to  “P6H”  the  other  approvals  obtained  by  the  Petitioner,  as  per  the"
"conditions contained in the ‘provisional approval’ issued by the SLSEA. Thus, the only"
"requirement that stood in the way towards the Petitioner obtaining the final approval (a"
"permit under section 18 of the SLSEA Act) from the SLSEA, was the “Letter of Intent” to"
"be issued by the CEB."
