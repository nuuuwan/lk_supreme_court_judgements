"judgment. The expansion of the length of this judgment to what it is, should therefore"
"be justifiably excused."
"2.3.1 Introduction to the doctrine of Legitimate Expectations and the underlying"
"policy"
"The doctrine of legitimate expectations is founded upon the principle that an"
"expectation generated due to representations made by or regular practices (procedures)"
"of a public body, should be respected by such public body, and it should conduct itself"
"in accordance with such representations made by itself and its own practices. Justice"
"demands that a public authority be prevented from frustrating an expectation generated"
"by it occasioned either by sudden changes to its governing policy or due to extraneous"
"or collateral reasons. This concept also relates to the extent to which a public authorityâ€™s"
"administrative power and discretionary authority may be limited by law for the"
"purpose of ensuring fairness. The imposition of such limitations would be justifiable"
"due to (a) the representations made by a public authority to the public at large and"
"more particularly to the persons who seek to either be regulated by or transact with"
"such public authority, as to how it will act in the future, and or (b) its own previous"
"related practices or procedures. In other words, the doctrine of legitimate expectations"
"is a means of keeping a public body bound by its own representations and practices."
