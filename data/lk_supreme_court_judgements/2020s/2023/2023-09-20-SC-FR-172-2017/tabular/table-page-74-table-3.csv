"Petitioner, the evidence placed before this Court reveals the following:"
"(a) the first two out of the three technical reasons were of generic character possibly"
"applicable to all on-grid renewable energy-based electricity generation projects."
"As at April 2012 when the Application of the Petitioner was being tendered to"
"the SLSEA, the CEB had not made a public announcement of such difficulties."
"Thus, the Petitioner had no basis to entertain a well-founded belief that the"
"application for a permit under section 18 of the SLSEA Act will not be"
"entertained positively due to such technical reasons. If in fact there were such"
"technical reasons which necessitated the CEB not to grant ‘grid interconnection"
"concurrence’ and ‘Letter of Intent’ to project proponents, it was incumbent on the"
"CEB to have made an announcement to that effect;"
