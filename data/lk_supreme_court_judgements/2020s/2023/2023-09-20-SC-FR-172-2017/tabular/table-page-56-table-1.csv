"‘Standardised Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA)’ for renewable energy projects of the"
"approved types, with an installed capacity of up to 10 MW. The SPPA is a standardised"
"and non-negotiable Agreement that the CEB enters into with project proponents which"
"stipulates the price at which the CEB will purchase electricity from the project proponent."
"This tariff has been approved by the PUCSL. The Petitioner’s position is that the project"
"proposed  by  the  Petitioner  comes  within  the  scope  of  that  Agreement.  Therefore,  the"
"Petitioner’s position is that, as the capacity of the Petitioner’s project is 10 MW, there is"
"no requirement to negotiate the terms and tariffs according to which electricity generated"
"from the project is to be purchased by the 1st Respondent (CEB) as they are regulated in"
"terms of the Standardised Power Purchase Agreement. Thus, the Petitioner claims that"
"the 1st Respondent (CEB) does not have any discretion in the matter of granting the ‘Letter"
"of  Intent’  to  the  Petitioner,  who  had  already  obtained  ‘provisional  approval’  founded"
"upon the 1st Respondent (CEB) issuing ‘grid interconnection concurrence’."
