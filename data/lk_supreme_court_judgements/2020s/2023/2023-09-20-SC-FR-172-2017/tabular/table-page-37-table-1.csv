"(i)","a public body cannot enlarge its powers by making ultra vires representations."
"","Thereby, the principle of legality is respected and thereby, the rule of law;"
"(ii)","requiring a public body not to be bound by its own unlawful representations"
"","would facilitate the public body not acting contrary to law. Also, the public"
"","body will thereby not be forced to act contrary to law;"
"(iii)","by not requiring a public body to act contrary to law, wider public interests"
"","are protected."
