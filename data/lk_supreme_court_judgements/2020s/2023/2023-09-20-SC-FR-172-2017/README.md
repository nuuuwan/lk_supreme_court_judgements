Yasantha Kodagoda, P.C., J.

This judgment relates to an Application filed by the Petitioner in terms of Articles 17 read

with Article 126 of the Constitution. Following the Application being supported, the

Supreme Court granted leave to proceed in terms of Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution.

1. Introduction

Through this Application, the Petitioner Vavuniya Solar Power (Pvt.) Ltd. complained

to this Court that its fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution the right to equality and equal protection of the law, and Article 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution the freedom to engage in any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or

enterprise, were infringed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 5

Albeit brief, the complaint of the Petitioner is that in April 2012 it presented to the 2nd

Respondent Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the SLSEA), an Application seeking approval to commission and operate a solar

power electricity generation plant in Vavuniya. In May 2016, provisional approval for

the project was granted by the 2nd Respondent. However, subsequently, as a result of a

Letter of Intent not being granted by the 1st Respondent Ceylon Electricity Board

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the CEB) indicating its intent to purchase

electricity generated from the proposed plant, the Petitioner company did not receive

the permit applied for from the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioners position is that in view

of the provisional approval it received from the 2nd Respondent, it entertained a

legitimate expectation that it will receive a Letter of Intent from the 1st Respondent

(as it had previously obtained grid interconnection concurrence from the 1st

Respondent and had complied with all the other conditions laid down in the

provisional approval) and thereafter, a permit be issued in terms of section 18 of the

Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act, to enable it to proceed with the project,

commission the electricity generation plant in order to provide electricity to the

national grid by selling such electricity to the CEB, and thereby secure its commercial

objectives.

The position of the 1st Respondent CEB is that in view of an amendment introduced to

the Sri Lanka Electricity Act in 2013, it became no longer possible to issue a Letter of

Intent to the Petitioner.

Thus, it is to be noted that this is a matter that relates directly to the 1st Respondent

CEB and the 2nd Respondent SLSEA. Though not a Respondent, this matter also

indirectly relates to the functioning of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the PUCSL).

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 6

2. Applicable legislative framework and legal principles

Particularly as the area of statutory law relevant to this matter argued before the

Supreme Court is not frequently referred to in judgments of this Court, this judgment

will commence upon a consideration of the applicable provisions of the Sri Lanka

Sustainable Energy Authority Act, No. 35 of 2007 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the SLSEA Act) and the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No. 20 of 2009 (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the SLE Act) as amended by Act No. 31 of 2013.

2.1 Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act

The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act No. 35 of 2007, came into operation on

1st October 2007. The SLSEA is a body corporate that has been established under the

SLSEA Act, No. 35 of 2007.

The SLSEA has been vested by the Act with the objects of inter-alia (i) identifying,

assessing and developing renewable energy resources with a view to enhancing energy

security and thereby deriving economic and social benefits to the country, and (ii) by

promoting security, reliability and cost-effectiveness of energy delivery to the country

by development and analysis of policy and related information management.

The SLSEA Act is an important statute aimed at creating necessary legal infrastructure

for the purpose of harnessing and regulating the use of the available renewable energy

resources in the country, and thereby enhancing and protecting energy security of Sri

Lanka. That objective is sought to be achieved by the development and optimal

utilization of renewable energy resources in the country, enabling sustainable

development of energy generation, which is a much-needed essential resource not only

for daily living, but for economic development of the country, as well.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 7

With the view to achieving the objectives of the SLSEA Act, the SLSEA has been vested

with certain powers and functions. In terms of section 13, the Authority has been vested

with the responsibility of conserving and managing all renewable energy resources in

Sri Lanka, and to take all necessary measures to promote and develop renewable energy

resources, with the view to obtaining the maximum economic utilization of those

resources.

The management and the administration of the SLSEA (2nd Respondent) has been

vested by the Act in its Board of Management [vide section 3(1)]. The Board has been

vested with the powers, duties and functions of inter-alia developing a conducive

environment for encouraging and promoting investments in renewable energy

development in the country, including the (i) development of guidelines on renewable

energy projects and disseminating them among prospective investors, and (ii)

development of guidelines in collaboration with relevant state agencies, on evaluation

and approval of on-grid and off-grid renewable energy projects [vide section 5(c)]. In

pursuance of that duty conferred on the SLSEA in terms of section 5(c) to create

awareness and issue guidelines, the Authority has inter-alia issued a publication entitled

A guide to the project approval process for on-grid renewable project development with the

description Policies and procedures to secure approvals to develop a renewable energy project

to supply electricity to the national grid. A copy of this publication was produced by the

Petitioner marked P2C.

The Board has also been empowered to entertain Applications for carrying on on-grid

and off-grid renewable energy projects [vide section 5(c)(iii)]. A template (prescribed

form) of the Application Form to be submitted in this regard to the SLSEA has been

issued by the Minister in terms of section 67 of the Act, and published in Government

Gazette No. 1599/6 dated 27th April 2009 (produced by the Petitioner marked P2A).

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 8

This template has been amended by Gazette No. 1705/22 dated 10th May 2011 (produced

by the Petitioner marked P2B).

The SLSEA Act stipulates that no person shall engage in or carry on an on-grid

renewable energy project or the generation and supply of power within a Development

Area (the entire country has been declared a Development Area), except under the

authority of a permit issued in that behalf by the SLSEA [vide section 16(1)]. Thus,

generation of electricity through an on-grid renewable project such as the project

proposed by the Petitioner can be carried out only with the legal entitlement emanating

from a permit issued by the 2nd Respondent in terms of section 18(2)(a) of the Act.

A person who is desirous of engaging in and carrying out an on-grid renewable energy

project within a Development Area, is required to submit an Application to the

Director-General of the SLSEA in the prescribed form, together with certain documents

specified in the Act [vide section 16(2)]. At the time relevant to this Application, the

prescribed form of the Application to be submitted was contained in the Gazette

notification dated 10th May 2011 issued by the Minister of Power and Energy in terms of

section 16(2) (P2B), which has amended the previous format of the Application form

contained in the Gazette notification issued by the Minister, dated 27th April 2009

(P2A).

Following the receipt of a perfected Application from a project proponent seeking a

permit to commission an electricity generation plant using renewable energy, the Act

requires the Director-General of the SLSEA to register the Application and issue a

registration number [vide section 16(3)]. Further, the SLSEA shall carry out preliminary

screening, and in consultation with the CEB, submit the Application to the Project

Approving Committee (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the PAC).

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 9

The practice followed by the SLSEA is that prior to submitting an Application to the

PAC, the SLSEA obtains grid concurrence of the CEB. This stage is referred to as the

stage where the SLSEA obtains from the CEB, grid interconnection concurrence. This

process involves the CEB examining the proposed project and considering whether it

would be technically feasible for the CEB to receive into the national electricity grid,

electricity generated by the project. It is important to note that the 1st Respondent CEB

is represented at the PAC and hence is in a position to take cognizance of the

submission of an Application by a project proponent and also submit its views at a

meeting of the PAC towards the decision of the 2nd Respondent SLSEA on whether or

not provisional approval should be granted to a particular applicant.

The PAC is an entity recognized by the Act and in terms of section 10, comprises of a

number of ex-officio officials, including the General-Manager of the CEB and

representatives of several other statutory bodies of the State performing functions

relevant to renewable energy projects. It is the PAC that is empowered to, on behalf of

the SLSEA grant provisional approval and final approval to an Application seeking

authorization (a permit) to commission a renewable energy based on-grid electricity

generation plant.

Should the PAC decide to grant provisional approval for a particular project, it may

require the applicant to submit within 6 months such documents and other information

as shall be prescribed for the purpose. The afore-stated period of 6 months granted to

comply with this requirement can upon a request being made by the applicant, be

extended by the Director-General of the SLSEA up to a maximum of a further 6 months

[vide section 17(3)]. If within the initial period of 6 months or the extended period of 1

year from the original grant of provisional approval, the documents and other

information referred to above (referred to above as conditions and information and

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 10

contained in the provisional approval) are not submitted, the provisional approval

granted shall stand automatically cancelled [vide section 17(4)].

Once such conditions have been fulfilled by a project proponent, the PAC may grant

provisional approval to such an Application seeking authorization (a permit) to

implement an on-grid renewable energy project, which decision shall be communicated

to the applicant by the Director General of the SLSEA [vide section 17(2)(a)]. Once the

necessary documents (including the authorizations specified in the provisional

approval) referred to above are obtained by the applicant and submitted to the Director-

General of the SLSEA, he shall forthwith place such material before the PAC, enabling

the committee (PAC) to consider granting final approval for the proposed project [vide

section 18]. In terms of section 18(2), the PAC is empowered to either approve or refuse

the Application for a permit. It is only if the PAC approves the Application, that the

SLSEA shall issue a permit to the applicant. If issued by the SLSEA, a permit will be

initially valid for a period of 20 years. This would be, provided the developer

commences the project and generates electricity within two years of being issued with

the permit [vide section 18(4)].

2.2 Sri Lanka Electricity Act

There is another law, the provisions of which are equally relevant to this matter. That is

the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No. 20 of 2009. This law has been enacted for the

regulation of the generation, distribution, transmission and supply of electricity. The

provisions of the SLE Act relate to all types of electricity generation plants, including

those powered by (i) non-renewable energy sources from which electricity may be

generated, such as petroleum, and (ii) renewable energy sources from which electricity

may be generated such as water, solar, wind and bio-mass. In terms of section 2(1) of

the SLE Act, the administration of the provisions of the Act shall vest in the PUCSL.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 11

An examination of the provisions of the SLE Act reveals that, a permit issued by the

SLSEA in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act by itself would not confer sufficient legal

authorisation for a project proponent to commission an on-grid renewable energy

project and commence generating electricity. A project proponent needs to obtain an

electricity generation license from the PUCSL (referred to as a generation license),

which the PUCSL is entitled to issue in terms of section 7(1) of the SLE Act. However, it

is important to note that, in so far as renewable energy-based electricity generation

plants are concerned, a condition precedent to applying to the PUCSL seeking an

electricity generation license, is the obtaining of a permit from the SLSEA, issued under

section 18 of the SLSEA Act. Thus, it would be seen that the law contemplates a two-

tiered process for the grant of approval for an on-grid renewable energy-based

electricity generation project. First, approval by the SLSEA and a permit. Secondly,

approval by the PUCSL and a license. As was shown earlier, the CEB is involved in the

grant of provisional approval and final approval and a permit by the SLSEA under

section 18 of the SLSEA Act. As would be seen hereinafter, the CEB becomes once again

involved in the grant of a generation license by the PUCSL. Thus, approval by the CEB

is critical.

According to section 7(1) of the SLE Act, no person shall (a) generate, (b) transmit, (c)

supply and or (d) distribute electricity for the purpose of giving a supply to any

premises or enabling a supply to be given to any premises, unless he is authorized to do

so by virtue of a license granted under the Act or is exempted from obtaining a license

under section 10. Section 9 stipulates the category of persons who is entitled to apply for

a license. However, in terms of section 9(2) of the Act, only the CEB shall be eligible to

apply for and obtain a license for the transmission of electricity. In that regard, the CEB

is referred to as the sole transmission licensee. Further, section 9(1) inter-alia provides

who would be entitled to apply for an electricity generation license. Similarly, in terms

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 12

of section 9(3), only the CEB and three other categories are entitled to apply for and

obtain a license for the distribution of electricity.

In terms of section 13 of the SLE Act, it is the PUCSL that is empowered to grant

electricity generation, distribution and transmission licenses. However, as prescribed by

sections 9 (1A) and 10 of the Act, the PUCSL may exempt certain persons or categories

of persons from the requirement of obtaining a license to generate or distribute

electricity. Upon an Application being made to it, having taken into consideration the

manner in which or the quantity of electricity likely to be generated or distributed by

such person or category of persons, the PUCSL may grant an exemption to such person

or category.

Section 43 of the SLE Act provides a statutory scheme to be adhered to in relation to the

procuring or operating a new electricity generation plant or the extension of electricity

generation capacity of an existing electricity generation plant.

Section 43 of Act No. 20 of 2009 was amended by section 13 of the Sri Lanka Electricity

(Amendment) Act No. 31 of 2013. It repealed the original section and caused the

substitution therefor a new section. It is pertinent to note that in terms of section 21 of

the SLE (Amendment) Act, No. 31 of 2013, the amendments made to the principal

enactment by the amending Act shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into

force, on 8th April, 2009. That is the date on which the principal enactment (SLE Act, No.

20 of 2009) had following its enactment been certified by the Speaker and thereby came

into operation. Thus, the amendments introduced by provisions of Act No. 31 of 2013

including the amendment to section 43 (which is described in detail below), should be

deemed to have been in force right from the beginning of Act No. 20 of 2009 having

come into operation.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 13

[I am acutely conscious that by the SLE (Amendment) Act No. 16 of 2022, the once

amended section 43 was re-amended. Act No. 16 of 2022 was certified by the Speaker

and came into operation on 15th June, 2022. However, as that amendment has no

relevance to the manner in which the Application presented by the Petitioner for a solar

power electricity generation permit was processed by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents, I

do not propose to deal with provisions of Act No. 16 of 2022 for the purpose of

determining the lawfulness or otherwise of the impugned conduct of the Respondents.

[The said amendment does not have a bearing on the findings reached by this Court or

to the reliefs ordered.]

According to the original section 43 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, subject to section 8,

no person shall procure or operate a new electricity generation plant or extend the

electricity generation capacity of any existing plant, except as authorized by the PUCSL

[Section 43(1)]. According to section 43(2), with the approval of the PUCSL, a

transmission licensee, shall in accordance with its license and guidelines relating to the

procurement of electricity as may be prescribed by the PUCSL, call for tenders to

provide a new electricity generation plant or to extend the generation capacity of an

existing generation plant, as specified in a notice calling for tenders. According to

section 43(3), a transmission licensee shall with the consent of the PUCSL, from

amongst the persons who have submitted technically acceptable tenders in response to

such notice, select a person to provide at least cost, the new generation plant or to

extend the generation capacity of an existing generation plant specified in that notice.

As stated above, Act No. 31 of 2013, amongst others repealed section 43 of Act No. 20 of

2009, and substituted therefor a new section. In terms of section 43 (as introduced by

Act No. 31 of 2013), no person shall proceed to procure or operate a new electricity

generation plant or engage in the expansion of the electricity generation capacity of an

existing plant, otherwise than in accordance with provisions of that section. In terms of

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 14

section 43(1) read with section 43(2), to proceed with the procuring or operating of any

new electricity generation plant or to expand the electricity generation capacity of an

existing plant, a transmission licensee shall submit a proposal to that effect to the

PUCSL, for its written approval. The proposal should be based on the future demand

forecast of electricity as specified in the Least Cost Long-term Generation Expansion

Plan (as defined in section 43(2) of the Act) of such transmission licensee. However, in

terms of the proviso to section 43(2), acting in terms of the afore-stated requirement

contained in section 43(2) shall not be necessary, where on the day prior to the date of

the coming into force of Act No. 31 of 2013 (that being 8th April 2009) - (a) the Cabinet of

Ministers had granted approval for the development of a new generation plant or to

expand the generation capacity of an existing plant, or (b) the SLSEA had issued a

permit in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act to generate electricity through renewable

energy resources, and as a consequence, the development of a new generation plant or

expansion of an existing plant has become necessary. In these two situations, the

transmission licensee will be entitled to obtain the approval from the PUCSL, without

complying with section 43(2) of the SLE Act (as amended).

In terms of section 43(4) (as amended) of the SLE Act, after obtaining the approval of

the PUCSL under section 43(2), the transmission licensee (CEB) shall in accordance with

the conditions of its license and applicable rules made by the Commission relating to

procurement, call for tenders by notice published in the Gazette to develop the

envisaged new generation plant or for the expansion of the generation capacity of an

existing plant. However, in terms of the proviso to section 43(4), subject to section 43(6),

this requirement of calling for tenders shall not be applicable in respect of any new

generation plant or to the expansion of any existing plant that is proposed to be

developed, which falls into one of the following situations:

(a) in accordance with the Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan

duly approved by the Commission and which has received the approval of

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 15

the Cabinet of Ministers on the date preceding the date of the coming into

operation of the Act and is required to be operated at least cost, or

(b) on a permit issued by the SLSEA and required to be operated at the standard

tariff and is governed by a Standardised Power Purchase Agreement (as

defined in section 43(8) of the Act) approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, or

(c) in compliance with the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan

duly approved by the Commission for which the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers has been received on the basis of - (i) an offer received from a

foreign government to the Government of Sri Lanka for which the approval

of the Cabinet of Ministers has been received, or (ii) to meet any emergency

situation as determined by the Cabinet of Ministers during a national

calamity or a long term forced outage of a major electricity generation plant,

where a protracted bid inviting process outweigh the potential benefit or

procuring emergency capacity required to be provided by any person at least

cost.

The procedure to be followed after calling for tenders is provided for in section 43(5). It

would be noted that the procedure contained in section 43 of the SLE Act, entails the

following of a competitive procedure and the transmission licensee (CEB)

recommending to the PUCSL the person best capable of developing the new generation

plant or the expansion of the generation capacity of an existing plant, selling electrical

energy or electricity generation capacity at least cost, and meeting the requirements of

the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan of the transmission licensee

(CEB). This recommendation should be made along with the draft Power Purchase

Agreement.

Section 43(6) provides that, (a) notwithstanding an exemption from the submission of a

tender is granted to any person under section 43(4), or (b) a new electricity generation

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 16

plant or an extension of an existing plant is being developed in accordance with the

Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan by a person who has obtained the

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers (which approval was in force at the time of the

coming into force of the Act), the transmission licensee shall engage in negotiations

with such person and upon satisfying itself of the competence of such person to develop

a generation plant and sell electricity at least cost, forward its recommendations along

with the draft power purchase agreement to the PUCSL.

According to section 43(7), upon receipt of a recommendation either in terms of section

43(5) or 43(6) of the Act, the Commission shall grant its approval at its earliest

convenience, provided it is satisfied that the recommended price for the purchase of

electricity meets the principle of least cost and the requirements of the Least Cost Long

Term Generation Expansion Plan and accepted technical and economical parameters of

the transmission licensee.

2.3 Legitimate Expectations

In view of the importance placed by learned counsel for the Petitioner on the doctrine of

legitimate expectations and the response thereto displayed by the learned Solicitor

General for the Respondents, incorporating into this judgement a somewhat detailed

description of the doctrine is in my view necessary. The need to do so is augmented by

some degree of ambiguity that seem to permeate across certain judgments of our Courts

regarding the nature, scope, applicability and limitations of the doctrine of legitimate

expectations and more particularly pertaining to the judicial response to a claim for

relief based on the sub-doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations. Thus, I propose

to devote the following lengthy description of the doctrine, mainly for the purpose of

highlighting the importance of the doctrine as a ground on which injustice emanating

from unfairness and abuse of power can be remedied and as a legal justification for this

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 17

judgment. The expansion of the length of this judgment to what it is, should therefore

be justifiably excused.

2.3.1 Introduction to the doctrine of Legitimate Expectations and the underlying

policy

The doctrine of legitimate expectations is founded upon the principle that an

expectation generated due to representations made by or regular practices (procedures)

of a public body, should be respected by such public body, and it should conduct itself

in accordance with such representations made by itself and its own practices. Justice

demands that a public authority be prevented from frustrating an expectation generated

by it occasioned either by sudden changes to its governing policy or due to extraneous

or collateral reasons. This concept also relates to the extent to which a public authoritys

administrative power and discretionary authority may be limited by law for the

purpose of ensuring fairness. The imposition of such limitations would be justifiable

due to (a) the representations made by a public authority to the public at large and

more particularly to the persons who seek to either be regulated by or transact with

such public authority, as to how it will act in the future, and or (b) its own previous

related practices or procedures. In other words, the doctrine of legitimate expectations

is a means of keeping a public body bound by its own representations and practices.

The recognition of this doctrine is founded upon the policy of the law of recognizing

and protecting legitimate expectations, arising out of a public authority having

undertaken expressly or impliedly, through representations made by itself or by its own

practices, to take decisions and or conduct itself in a particular manner in the future. In

effect, this doctrine requires public authorities to comply with its own undertakings, the

failure of which gives rise to judicial review resulting in judicial pronouncements being

made requiring the public authority to conduct itself in the prescribed manner, decide

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 18

as directed by court and or sanctions being made for having frustrated legitimate

expectations.

In R v. Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Behluli [(1998) Imm. AR 407, at

415] Beldam LJ, observed that although legitimate expectation may in the past have been

categorized as a catchphrase not be elevated into a principle, or as an easy cover for a general

complaint about unfairness, it has nevertheless achieved an important place in developing the

law of administrative fairness. It is an expectation which, although not amounting to an

enforceable legal right, is founded on a reasonable assumption which is capable of being protected

in public law. It enables a citizen to challenge a decision which deprives him of an expectation

founded on a reasonable basis that his claim would be dealt with in a particular way.

Protecting expectations generated by public authorities through the doctrine of

legitimate expectations and judicial insistence that expectations so generated be

complied with by the relevant public authority is also fundamental to good governance.

In the long-term, it would be dangerous to permit public authorities to freely renege on

their undertakings, as it would pave the way to public authorities functioning in an

unreasonable or arbitrary manner, or otherwise abusing power conferred on them. The

publics trust and confidence in public authorities can be protected by requiring public

authorities to comply with their own undertakings.

The doctrine of public trust inter-alia requires that public authorities who have been

vested with statutorily conferred power to discharge public functions vested in them for

the benefit of the sovereign of the Republic the public at large, and for no other

purpose. Public authorities must discharge such functions in accordance with the law

and they must abide by the expectations generated by their own representations and

practices. In a Republic, the trust conferred by the sovereign public on public authorities

must be respected, unless there are justiciable reasons developed objectively, diligently

and in good faith for the purpose of giving effect to wider public interests, that

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 19

necessitate deviating from the previous policy based upon which the previous

representations had been made.

The rationale of the doctrine of legitimate expectations is also that if a public authority

has induced a person to rely upon its representations or practices on the premise that

such reliance was a real possibility and would bear fruit, it is under a fiduciary duty to

act in such a way that the reliance placed by such person will not result in detrimental

outcomes to such person, who in good faith had placed reliance on the representations

of a public authority and its practices. Public authorities must be required by law to

honour expectations created by its own representations and practice. If unable to do so,

the public authority concerned should compensate the person affected by having placed

reliance on such representations and practices.

From the perspectives of the all-important and fundamental feature of our Republican

Constitution the rule of law, for the following reasons, recognition and the enforcement

of the doctrine of legitimate expectations make good sense:

(i) Respect for an expectation created by a public authority makes the exercise of

discretion by such authority more predictable. The rule of law presupposes the

enforcement of formal equality. Without formal equality, the enforcement of

the law can become arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair and uncertain. Thus, like

cases must be decided upon in a like manner, by the correct and consistent

application of the law.

(ii) The rule of law also presupposes a certain measure of consistency and

uniformity in the application and the enforcement of the law. The law should

provide for administrative action that is based upon a mix of short-term

exigencies and long-term considerations. An individuals planning and

preparation becomes difficult, if not impossible, if policy and procedure are

changed too often or abruptly, and public authorities conduct themselves in

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 20

an inconsistent manner and contrary to their own representations,

undertakings and previous conduct.

(iii) The rule of law also demands that a persons legitimate expectation should not

be frustrated without a justiciable cause generated by the desire to serve

wider public interests.

Thus, from the perspective of the rule of law, recognition of the doctrine of legitimate

expectations gives rise to predictability and certainty through consistency and

uniformity, formal equality, reasonableness, fairness, and non-retroactivity, which as I

have stated above are features of the rule of law. Therefore, this doctrine supports the

recognition and enforcement of the rule of law.

However, it must also be noted that public authorities must be vested with

discretionary authority with regard to the exercise of power vested in them. Without

discretion, public authorities would not be able to successfully exercise power for the

purpose for which such power has been vested in them. Exercise of discretion may

entail changes to the applicable policy and criteria and the procedure to be followed in

the exercise of power. In the circumstances, the exercise of discretion which results in

certain changes to be made to policy and procedure, can create tension between

administrative autonomy and legal certainty. There can be situations where a public

authority may have to frustrate an expectation it has generated, due to justiciable

reasons which are in the wider public interest. In such situations, it would be the duty

of the public institutions to explain reasons for the deviation from the expectation it had

generated and proceed to satisfy court regarding the lawfulness of the change and its

justiciability. Prior to the change in policy, criteria and procedure, the relevant public

authority should have informed those who may have by that time had a legitimate

expectation that the previous policy, criteria and procedure would be applied, of the

intended change, and afforded them an opportunity of being heard. Public authorities

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 21

must bear in mind that, as held by Justice Dr. A.R.B. Amerasinghe in Dayarathna and

Others v Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine and Others [(1999) 1 Sri L.R. 393],

although the Executive ought not in the exercise of its discretion be restricted to cause a

change of policy, a public authority is not entirely free to overlook the existence of a

legitimate expectation it has created.

The importance of legal certainty is for the benefit of not only the individual to whom

the representation has been made, but also to the public at large. Further, maintenance

of legal certainty is in the interest of public institutions as well, as it would generate

public confidence in such institutions.

Representations by public authorities may create expectations regarding the criteria that

would be applied and the manner in which it would apply such criteria when

exercising discretionary authority. Representations by public authorities may also relate

to assurances of specific outcomes. Respect to such expectations makes the exercise of

discretion and its outcome predictable, thus, creating a degree of certainty with regard

to possible outcomes.

Recognizing the doctrine of legitimate expectations is also a means of ensuring

administrative fairness. It curtails the opportunity public authorities would otherwise

have, to decide on matters subjectively, or in an arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable

manner. Therefore, the exercise of administrative discretion is required by law to be

subject to the legal duty cast on public authorities to honour legitimate expectations

generated by it through its own representations and practices.

The principle of legitimate expectations is also supportive of administrative efficacy and

legitimacy of the exercise of administrative power. The enforcement of statutorily

conferred power is likely to be perceived as being legitimate, thus justifiable and in

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 22

public interest, if exercised in a way that recognizes legitimate expectations. Thus, the

recognition of the principle of legitimate expectations is in the best interests of not only

individuals who transact with such public authorities and the general public, but also of

the administration, itself.

2.3.2 Evolution of the doctrine of legitimate expectations and its present status

Though the actual origins of the doctrine of legitimate expectations can be traced to the

20th century developments of German administrative law, the formal recognition of this

doctrine by English administrative law can be traced back to Schmidt and Another v.

Secretary for Home Affairs [(1969) 1 All ER 904]. In that case, Lord Denning MR

responding to an allegation that the Home Secretary had, without affording a student a

fair hearing, refused an extension of a temporary permit previously granted to him to

remain in the United Kingdom, observed that, the question of being entitled in law to a

hearing prior to a decision being taken, depends on whether or not the claimant had

some right or interest or a legitimate expectation that a fair hearing would be afforded

before a decision was taken. He further observed that, it would not be fair to take a

decision without affording the person concerned a formal and fair hearing enabling him

to make representations on his behalf. However, in his judgment, Lord Denning did not

define the scope of the doctrine of legitimate expectations and the basis for it. Lord

Denning also did not distinguish the doctrine from the right to a fair hearing

(compliance with the rules of natural justice) pertaining to a right or a protectable

interest.

In Regina v. Liverpool Corporation Ex Parte Liverpool Taxi Fleet Operators

Association and Another [(1972) 2QB 299], the Queens Bench held that it was unfair to

increase the number of taxi licenses without consulting the Taxi Fleet Operators

Association, as it was contrary to the earlier practice adopted by the Liverpool

Corporation. In Attorney General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu [(1983) 2 AC 629], the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 23

Privy Council quashed a deportation order issued on a purported illegal immigrant on

the footing that, taking the impugned decision without affording the immigrant an

opportunity to present his case, was not in the interests of good administration. In this

matter too, the Court considered the need for the public authority to have afforded a

fair hearing, independent of the duty to comply with the rules of natural justice.

In the leading case of Council of Civil Service Unions and others v. Minister for the

Civil Service, [(1985) AC 374], famously known as the GCHQ Case, the issue

confronted by the House of Lords, was whether the claimants were entitled to a

legitimate expectation of consultation, prior to a decision being taken by the Prime

Minister to withdraw the entitlement of GCHQ employees to be members of national

trade unions. It was not in dispute that prior to the impugned decision being taken,

such a consultation process did not take place, notwithstanding on previous occasions

such consultations having taken place.

Lord Fraser observed that a legitimate or reasonable expectation may arise either from

an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a

regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue. It is the latter

criterion that was held to be applicable to the instant case. In the circumstances, Lord

Fraser proceeded to hold that the test to be applied is whether the practice of prior

consultation with regard to significant changes to the conditions of service of the

employees was so well established by 1983, that it would be unfair or inconsistent with

good administration for the government to have departed from that practice in this

case. Lord Fraser noted that ever since the establishment of the GCHQ in 1947, prior

consultation had been an invariable rule. Thus, if there was no question of national

security involved, the appellants would have had a legitimate expectation that the

Prime Minister accords them a consultation before changing the conditions of

employment.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 24

Lord Diplock observed that to qualify for judicial review, the impugned decision must

have consequences which affect some person other than the decision-maker, though it

can affect the decision-maker as well. It must affect the other person (claimant), either

(a) by altering rights or obligations of that person which are enforceable by or against

him in private law, or (b) deprive him of some benefit or advantage which either (i) he

had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can

legitimately be expected to be permitted to continue until some rational ground for

withdrawing it had been communicated to him, and he had been given an opportunity

to comment, or (ii) he has received an assurance from the decision-maker that the

benefit or advantage will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of

advancing reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn. [It is category (b)

that can be referred to as giving rise to an legitimate expectation.]

In R v Secretary of State for Home Department ex parte Khan [(1985) 1 All ER 40], the

court indirectly recognized the sub-doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations. It

held that, the Secretary of State should not be allowed to frustrate the applicants

legitimate expectation that, upon fulfillment of the stipulated conditions discretion

would be exercised in his favour, without a hearing being given, unless there is an

overriding public interest to have changed the policy.

Therefore, it is observable that it is the sub-doctrine of procedural legitimate

expectations that was first recognized and developed in English Law. According to

what has been developed by courts under this sub-doctrine, where a public authority

has, acting in terms of the law, given an assurance to the claimant that it will afford him

a hearing before a policy is changed as regards a matter that affects him, or made

known its policy with regard to that matter or has an established practice of affording a

hearing before a change of policy is effected, that claimant will entertain a procedural

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 25

legitimate expectation that the public authority will give him reasonable and adequate

opportunity to make representations and be heard before it changes its policy. A court

may, by judicial review, enforce such a legitimate expectation other than in limited

circumstances such as in instances where considerations of national security override

the expectation of being consulted or heard [such as in the GCHQ case].

The sub-doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations on the other hand, emerged and

developed more recently in English Law. In R v Secretary of State for the Home

Department ex parte Ruddock and others [1987) 2 All ER 518], upon considering a long

line of English cases, the court concluded that the need to ensure fairness had resulted

in the recognition of a doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations. Justice Taylors

words in this regard were as follows:

I conclude that the doctrine of legitimate expectation in essence imposes a duty to act

fairly. While most of the cases are concernedwith a right to be heard, I do not think the

doctrine is so confined. Indeed, in a case where ex hypothesi there is no right to be heard,

it may be thought the more important to fair dealing that a promise or undertaking given

by a minister as to how he will proceed should be kept. Of course, such promise or

undertaking must not conflict with his statutory duty or his duty, as here, in the exercise

of a prerogative power.

In R v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Offshore) Fisheries

Ltd [(1995) 2 All ER 714], the court adopted the approach taken by Justice Taylor in ex

parte Ruddock, and held that the sub-doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations

enabled a court to uphold a substantive legitimate expectation on broader grounds,

than being confined to determining whether a public authoritys decision to change its

policy was unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense. Justice Sedley held as follows:

The balance must in the first instance be for the policy-maker to strike; but if the

outcome is challenged by way of judicial review, I do not consider that the courts

criterion is the bare rationality of the policy-makers conclusion. Where the policy is for

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 26

the policy-maker alone, the fairness of his or her decision not to accommodate reasonable

expectations which the policy will thwart remains the courts concern.

However, the case of R v Secretary of State for the Home Department and another, ex

parte Hargreaves and others [(1997) 1 All ER 397], is said to have cast the existence of

substantive legitimate expectations into doubt. It was held that the discretionary power

of the Secretary of State to change his policy decision could not be challenged by

judicial review, as it would amount to a fettering of discretion. It was held that it was

not for the court determine the fairness of the Secretary of States actions, as doing so

would amount to looking into the merits of his decision. It was further held that the act

of weighing and balancing between individual and public interest is for the decision-

maker and that the court could only intervene where it could be shown that the

Secretarys decision was unreasonable or perverse in the Wednesbury sense.

The sub-doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations once again gained momentum

following the Court of Appeal decision in R v North and East Devon Health Authority

ex parte Coughlan [(2000) All ER 850]. In recognizing the sub-doctrine of substantive

legitimate expectations, it was held that where the court considers that a lawful promise or

practice has induced a legitimate expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not simply

procedural, authority now establishes that here too, the court will in a proper case decide whether

to frustrate the expectation is so unfair that to take a new and different course will amount to an

abuse of power.

It was also held that once it is recognized that conduct which is an abuse of power is

contrary to law, its existence must be for the court to determine, and that review in such

instance is not limited to the test of Wednesbury unreasonableness. Ex parte Coughlan is

regarded as a welcome development in settling the controversy over substantive

legitimate expectations in English law. The subsequent decisions have followed this

case in determining matters pertaining to substantive legitimate expectations.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 27

The developments in English law on the doctrine of legitimate expectations have

influenced the Sri Lankan administrative law jurisprudence on legitimate expectations.

For instance, the earliest cases on legitimate expectations such as Dayaratne v Bandara

[(1983) BLR vol. 1, part 1 p.23], Sundarkaran v Bharathi [(1989) 1 Sri.LR 46], Dissanayake

v Kaleel [(1993) 2 Sri.LR 135] and Multinational Property Development Ltd v Urban

Development Authority [(1996) 2 Sri.LR 51] have recognized and ensured the protection

of procedural legitimate expectations.

With the increased recognition in English Law of the sub-doctrine of substantive

legitimate expectations, our courts also have recognized the protection of substantive

legitimate expectations. The first direct reference in Sri Lanka to legitimate

expectations of a substantive character is seen in the judgment of Sharvananda CJ in

Mowjood v. Pussadeniya [(1987) 2 Sri LR 287] where the court held that the Petitioner

Appellants have a legitimate expectation that they would not be evicted from their

present houses except after following the procedure stipulated in the Act and the grant

of proper alternate accommodation (as opposed to mere alternate accommodation).

Court approached judicial review of the notification issued by the Commissioner of

National Housing from the perspective of abuse of power. Court recognized that the

Petitioner Appellant had both a legitimate expectation as regards the procedure the

Commission would follow as well as the nature of the decision he would take, thus,

recognizing both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations.

A more progressive approach towards substantive legitimate expectations was adopted

by this Court in the case of Dayarathna v Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine

[(1999) 1 Sri.LR 393], which followed the English case of R v Minister of Agriculture,

Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Offshore) Fisheries Ltd. In his judgment, Justice

Amerasinghe expressed the view that although the executive ought not in the exercise of its

discretion to be restricted so as to hamper or prevent change of policy, yet it is not entirely free to

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 28

overlook the existence of a legitimate expectation. Each case must depend on its circumstances.

Justice Amerasinghe further observed that the Courts delicate and sensitive task is one of

weighing genuine public interest against private interests and deciding on the legitimacy of an

expectation having regard to the weight it carries in the face of the need for a policy change

The change of policy, in the circumstances, may nevertheless affect the future, having regard to

the fact that the legislature and executive are free to formulate and reformulate policy; however,

it is the duty of this Court to safeguard the rights and privileges, as well as interests deserving of

protection such as those based on legitimate expectations, of individuals.

In Sirimal and others v Board of Directors of the Co-operative Wholesale

Establishment and others [(2003) 2 Sri.LR 23], Justice Weerasuriya, while recognizing

the fact that the frontiers of legitimate expectations in Administrative law have been greatly

expanded in recent years to admit of a substantive content, followed the narrow approach

taken in the English case of R v Secretary of State for the Home Department and

another, ex parte Hargreaves and others, and expressed the view that the protection of a

substantive legitimate expectation has to be sought on the more traditional approaches

of English Law, i.e. protection in terms of Wednesbury Unreasonableness. He further

expressed the view that it is for the decision-maker and not for the court to judge

whether that expectation should be protected or whether broader public interest is so

strong as to override that expectation. It was held in that case that the court would only

intervene if the decision-makers judgment was perverse or irrational. However, it must

be noted that Justice Weerasuriya did not consider the more recent developments in the

English Laws jurisprudence on legitimate expectations such as the principles contained

in ex parte Coughlan, thus, compelling me to distance myself from the views expressed

by Justice Weerasuriya as to the criteria based upon which substantive relief should be

granted by court.

In the more recent case of M.R.C.C. Ariyarathne and others v N.K. Illangakoon,

Inspector General of Police and others [SC FR 444/2012, SC Minutes of 30.07.2019],

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 29

Justice Prasanna Jayawardane adopted the wider approach taken in Dayarathna case.

His Lordship was of the view that a court is not confined in cases of substantive

legitimate expectations, to reviewing the public authoritys decision on the traditional

test of unreasonableness described in the Wednesbury case. His Lordship identified that

the test of Wednesbury unreasonableness is adequate in a case where there is a single

exercise of power by a public authority. However, in a case where the petitioner claims

a substantive legitimate expectation, there is a dual exercise of power and that his case

is linked to both exercises of power. If a court confined itself to the test in Wednesbury,

Justice Jayawardena expressed the view that the court would only be reviewing the

second exercise of power, by asking whether it is unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense.

He held that a court considering judicial review must consider and evaluate both

competing interests, i.e. the assurance which created the expectation, and the reasons

for the public authoritys change of policy or decision which resulted in the negation of

that expectation. His view was that considering only one of the two competing interests,

would place the court in abhorrent realm of inequity.

The decision in Ariyarathne was followed in the subsequent decisions of this Court on

legitimate expectations including in the cases of Chanaka Harsha Talpahewa v Prasad

Kariyawasam, Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and others [SC FR 378/2017,

SCM 21.06.2022], and Werage Sunil Jayasekera and others v B.A.P. Ariyaratne, General

Manager, Department of Railways [SC FR 64/2014, SCM 05.04.2022].

Therefore, it is seen that the criteria based upon which substantive relief is granted is no

longer limited the instances where the claimant can successfully establish that the

change of policy on the part of the concerned public authority is so very unreasonable

that it satisfies the degree of unreasonableness contemplated in the Wednesburys case.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 30

2.3.3 Nature of the representation that should have been made or the practice of the

public authority that would entitle a person to claim, founded upon the doctrine of

legitimate expectations:

In order to obtain relief through judicial review on the footing that a legitimate

expectation had arisen, the nature of the representation that should have been made by

the public authority should be a promise or an undertaking or its own previous

practice, both of which should meet the following principles:

(i) As held in The United Policyholders Group and Others v. The Attorney

General of Trinidad and Tobago [(2016) UKPC 17], the representation should

be clear, unambiguous and devoid of qualifications.

(ii) As observed by this Court in Pavithra Dananjanie De Alwis v. Anura

Edirisinghe, Commissioner General of Examinations and 7 Others [(2011) 1

Sri L.R. 18], the undertaking given by the public authority need not be in

written form, and it would be sufficient if the undertaking could be inferred

through the surrounding attendant circumstances.

(iii) As held in the GCHQ Case the decision-maker must have made a specific

announcement, or given an express promise or a specific undertaking, or

impliedly generated a promise or undertaking by its unambiguous and

consistent past practice.

(iv) If the representation was in the form of an announcement, promise or an

undertaking, it should take the form of (a) a general representation made in

rem (to the world at large) or to a specific class of persons, or (b) a specific

representation addressed to the claimant or to a group of persons including

the claimant who fall into the same category.

(v) A general representation can take the form of a formal announcement, a

circular letter, or a statement of policy issued by the public authority

concerned. It can also take the form of a publication containing the manner in

which it proposes to deal with persons in the category of the claimant, or

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 31

containing previous decisions or extra-statutory concessions that have been

made in the past and will be granted in the future.

(vi) The representation relied upon by the claimant need not have been

personally made to him. However, it should relate to the category of persons

to whom the claimant belongs. Similarly, the past practice of the public

authority need not necessarily be aimed at the claimant. However, the past

practice should relate to the category of persons to whom the claimant

belongs.

(vii) The claimant should belong to the class of persons to whom the

representation made by the decision-maker was reasonably be expected to

apply. Whether or not a particular representation by a public authority is to

give rise to a legitimate expectation or not, is not to be decided based on the

intention of the decision-maker. The question to be determined is whether the

representation may reasonably have induced a person within the class of

persons to whom it was addressed, to rely on it. It is the context of the

representation that is important as opposed to the specific contents thereof.

(viii) The representation should relate to an undertaking or promise of a benefit or

an advantage the public authority is expecting to give or a course of action it

is expecting to take that would be in the interest of the claimant.

(ix) If the representation was specific to the claimant, it should have been in

response to a full and accurate disclosure by the claimant. Thus, the claimant

should have received the undertaking or promise after his having made a full

and accurate disclosure of all the relevant facts.

(x) As held in Vasana v. Incorporated Council of Legal Education [2004 (1 SLR

154)], the representation made by the public authority, should not be based

on a mistake of facts by itself.

(xi) As held in R v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Ruddock

and Others (referred to above) the representation should have been made by

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 32

officials on behalf of the public authority who had actual or ostensible legal or

administrative authority to make such representation.

(xii) A public authority is generally not liable to give effect to unauthorized or

unlawful representations made by its officials. If the claimant either knew or

had reason to believe that the official who had made the representation did

not have authority to make such a representation, or in the circumstances he

ought to have known so, the public body will not be bound by such

representation.

2.3.4 Detrimental reliance

When a public authority makes representations containing its policy or conducts itself

in a particular manner, it is natural that persons who engage with such authority or

have dealings relevant to such representations or conduct, would fashion their own

conduct placing reliance on such representations or conduct, as the case may be. In that

backdrop, when the public authority changes its policy, it may result to the detriment of

those who placed reliance on the previous representations or conduct of such public

authority. This would result in the frustration of the expectations of those who placed

reliance. In other words, placing reliance has been to the detriment of the person who

placed such reliance. This is referred to as detrimental reliance. In most cases, it is such

detrimental reliance which causes grievance to the claimant, resulting in his

complaining to court that he had developed a legitimate expectation founded upon

representations made or the past practices of a particular public authority, which was

later frustrated by it.

However, in the case of Attorney General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu (referred to

above), the Court held that a legitimate expectation may arise even in the absence of a

detrimental reliance. Thus, detrimental reliance is not a sine qua non for legitimate

expectations to be enforced. Actually, a detrimental reliance can arise only if the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 33

claimant knew of representations made or previous practice of the public authority, and

if he acted upon the belief that it would continue to be applied. However, if he had no

knowledge of previous representations made or past practices of the public authority,

the issue of detrimental reliance would not even arise. Nevertheless, it must be borne in

mind that by establishing detrimental reliance, the case for frustration of a legitimate

expectation can be strengthened and the court will then be more receptive to the

claimant. This is seen in Wickremaratne v Jayaratne and another [(2001) 3 Sri L.R. 161],

where Justice U. De Z. Gunawardane held as follows:

In this case the petitioners interest lay in some ultimate benefit which he hoped to

attain or possibly retain It is felt that acting to ones detriment in reliance upon a

promise or undertaking given by a public authority or anyone else can strengthen or add

to the weight of the legitimate expectation induced thereby, in such a situation, therefore,

the counterbalancing public interest should be weightier than in a case where there had

been no such detrimental reliance

Implications of the representation

In order to successfully claim relief on the basis of a legitimate expectation that has been

frustrated, the claimant must establish that the representation made by the public

authority or its past conduct generated an expectation which is justiciable in the eyes

of the law. As recognized in Desmond Perera and Others v. Karunaratne,

Commissioner of National Housing and Others [(1994) 3 Sri L.R. 316], it was observed

by the Court of Appeal that establishing that the claimant entertained a hope or

reasonable hope was insufficient to successfully claim relief through the doctrine of

legitimate expectation. I find myself in agreement with that view. The claimant must

establish that he entertained or was entitled to entertain a well-founded expectation

justiciable in law.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 34

In R. v. Department of Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie [(2000) 1 WLR

1115], court observed that as the representations cited by the claimant had been made

by certain politicians who were not officials of the relevant public authority, and though

such representations would have given rise to an expectation as claimed by the

claimant, such expectation cannot be recognized as a legitimate expectation which can

be protected by law, and therefore, relief cannot be granted founded on the doctrine of

legitimate expectations. Quoting from the GCHQ judgment, the court held that

legitimate or reasonable expectation may arise either from an express promise given on behalf of

a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably

expect to continue.

In Siriwardana v Seneviratne and others [(2011) 2 Sri.LR 1], Chief Justice Shirani

Bandaranayake cited the following extract from the Indian case of India v Hindustan

Development Corporation [(1993) 2 SCC 499] to hold that a mere expectation does not

amount to it being legally protected:

However earnest and sincere a wish, a desire or a hope may be and however confidently

one may look to them to be fulfilled, they by themselves cannot amount to an assertible

expectation and a mere disappointment does not attract legal consequencesThe

legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or

custom or an established procedure followed in natural and regular consequence. Again,

it is distinguishable from a mere expectation. Such expectation should be justifiable,

legitimate and protectable. Every such legitimate expectation does not by itself fructify

into a right and, therefore, it does not amount to a right in a conventional sense.

It would thus be seen that, embodied in the doctrine of legitimate expectations, are

three key variables. They are -

(i) a public authority having through representations made by it or by its

conduct generated an expectation,

(ii) legitimacy of that expectation, and

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 35

(iii) the protection conferred by law on the expectation that had been generated.

As to legitimacy of the expectation arising out of a representation made or past practice

of a public authority, the law is concerned only of the expectation the person concerned

is entitled to develop, as opposed to the subjective expectation actually entertained in

the mind of such person. Thus, the question to be asked is, what was the expectation the

person concerned was entitled by law to develop in his mind by the representation or

the conduct of the public authority concerned. Once the court identifies the legitimacy

of the expectation generated by the public authority, the court needs to identify how

that expectation needs to be protected, having regard to the competing interests of

protecting discretionary freedom of the public authority versus maintaining legal

certainty of its decisions.

2.3.5 Expectations generated through lawful & unlawful representations and

practices of public authorities

Expectations attributed to representations and practices of public authorities can relate

to two distinct situations. They are, expectations generated through (i) lawful

presentations and practices, and (ii) unlawful representations and practices.

2.3.5.1 Expectations generated through lawful representations and practices

When a public authority has generated expectations through lawful representations or

practices (which is a reference to situations where the representations or conduct cited

by the claimant are lawful / intra-vires the powers of the relevant public authority),

whether or not the claimant is entitled to claim a legitimate expectation will be

governed by legal principles discussed in the other parts of this judgment under the

title doctrine of legitimate expectations.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 36

2.3.5.2 Expectations generated through representations or practices which are

unlawful and / or ultra-vires the powers of the public authority

Such expectations may relate to two situations:

(i) Where officials of the public authority concerned who generated the

expectation through representations made by them had acted ultra-vires the

authority conferred on them by the public authority, made representations

which are unlawful, and the public authority now wishes to act intra-vires its

legal authority;

(ii) where the public authority had itself acted ultra-vires its authority and made

unlawful representations.

A public authority arguing that it did not have lawful authority to make the

representations it did (which has given rise to the expectations of the claimant) is

unattractive. Allowing a public body to avoid being bound by its own previous

representations on that footing seems to be unfair. However, a court cannot compel a

public body to do what it is not legally empowered to do. In Rowland v. Environment

Agency [2005 Ch 1] , R (Bibi) v. Newnham London Borough Council [(2002) 1 WLR 237]

and R (Bloggs 61) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [(2003) 1 WLR 2724],

court made it abundantly clear that the doctrine of legitimate expectations cannot

operate so as to extend the powers of a public authority, by rendering enforceable, acts

or decisions which are ultra vires the authority of the body itself. In Rowland v.

Environment Agency (referred to above) it was held that the fundamental principle is that,

a legitimate expectation can only arise on the basis of a lawful promise.

Court cannot order public authorities to fulfil promises which are beyond their powers

or unlawful. In the event a court recognizes that a public body has made certain

representations which are ultra vires its powers, which have given rise to an

expectation, it will not recognize the existence of an enforceable substantive legitimate

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 37

expectation and therefore will not require the public authority to act contrary to law.

Such approach is founded on the following three reasons:

(i) a public body cannot enlarge its powers by making ultra vires representations.

Thereby, the principle of legality is respected and thereby, the rule of law;

(ii) requiring a public body not to be bound by its own unlawful representations

would facilitate the public body not acting contrary to law. Also, the public

body will thereby not be forced to act contrary to law;

(iii) by not requiring a public body to act contrary to law, wider public interests

are protected.

However, some amount of protection to unlawfully generated promises may be

possible for bona-fide claimants. While a public body cannot be required to do what is

legally impossible, it can be required by court to exercise its powers benevolently, so as

to respect, as far as legally possible, the expectation generated (engendered) by it. (This

is referred to as the doctrine of benevolent exercise of power.) Compensation in lieu of

the fulfilment of the unlawfully generated expectation, is one option available. By this

approach, on the one hand, public interests in not compelling a public body to do what

it is not empowered to do or to act contrary to law, is protected. On the other hand, the

private interests of the claimant based on the doctrine of fairness is recognized and

protected by ordering the payment of compensation.

2.3.8 Procedural and Substantive Legitimate Expectations

Based on the nature of the representation made or practices and conduct of public

authorities and the expectations generated by them, the law recognizes two types of

legitimate expectations. They are procedural legitimate expectations and substantive

legitimate expectations. If what can be inferred by the representation made or the

practices of the public authority is adherence to a particular procedure to be followed

when taking a decision, then the court may, through the recognition of the doctrine of

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 38

procedural legitimate expectation, require the public authority concerned to adhere to

such procedure that was undertaken to be followed. The expectation generated by a

public authority can also take a substantive character, in the nature of the public

authority having through its representations or practices, given rise to a legitimate

expectation that a particular outcome or benefit would be awarded. That situation is

recognized as having given rise to a substantive legitimate expectation, and thus, the

court can require the relevant public authority to respect the expectation that was

generated by it, and grant to the claimant the expected outcome.

2.3.8.1 Procedural Legitimate Expectations

Generally, a court would protect an individuals expectation by requiring a fair

procedure to be followed before the public authority makes the relevant decision. If the

claimant expected procedural fairness, this approach of court would fulfil the claimants

expectation. Procedural fairness may also be conferred by court in a situation where

even though the claimant expected a particular substantive outcome, the court has

concluded that, when preserving discretionary freedom of the public authority, the

authority should be required to adhere to procedural fairness (only), and that

compliance with such procedural fairness would be sufficient. In situations where the

court recognizes only procedural fairness, the public authority would be entitled to

arrive at a lawful decision (having adhered to procedural fairness), though such

decision may be contrary to the expectation of the claimant.

The duty to act fairly and procedural protection arising out of legitimate expectations

are similar, yet, not identical. The duty to act fairly is a flexible concept based on the

rules of natural justice. Its precise meaning and the manner in which audi alteram partem

of the rules of natural justice must be given effect to, depend on the context. Thus,

different situations will require different levels of fairness and procedure to be adopted.

The principle of legitimate expectations can influence the degree of fairness and the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 39

exact nature of the procedure to be adopted. The existence of a legitimate expectation

may require the public authority to confer on the claimant a more detailed (generous)

and specific form of procedural fairness in line with previous practice of and

representations made by the public authority, than what he would be entitled to if there

was no legitimate expectation and the claimant sought only compliance with audi

alteram partem. Therefore, should the claimant insist on the public authority having

followed a detailed or specific procedure (in excess of what the rules of natural justice

would require), he would need to establish that he had a procedural legitimate

expectation in that regard. Such expectation may arise out of representations made or

previous practices of the relevant public authority.

A frustration of procedural legitimate expectations can arise in the following situations:

(i) claimant relied on a policy or norm of general application, which had

changed, and therefore applied differently;

(ii) the claimant relied on a declared policy or norm, which was not changed, but

did not apply to the claimant;

(iii) the claimant received a promise or representation, which was not honoured

in respect of the claimant, due to a change in policy or a norm pertaining to

procedure;

(iv) the claimant received a promise or representation, which was dishonoured in

respect of the claimant, not due to a general change in policy, but because the

decision-maker has in the particular instance changed his mind.

In Attorney General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu (referred to above) while recognizing

the doctrine of procedural legitimate expectation, the Privy Council held that when a

public body has promised to follow a particular procedure, it is in the interests of good

administration that it should act fairly and implement its promise, so long as the

implementation does not interfere with its statutory duties.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 40

In Sundarkaran v. Bharathi and Others [(1989) 1 Sri LR 46], the Petitioner Appellant

had a liquour license for the two preceding years, and applied for a license for the

following year (1987). He was required by the relevant authorities to pay the license fee.

When he attempted to do so at the office of the Government Agent, he was informed

that a license could not be issued to him as he had failed to obtain the consent of all the

Members of Parliament of the area, which was a requirement in terms of a circular

issued in 1986 (which became applicable for the first time). He moved for a writ of

Mandamus from the Court of Appeal, and having failed, appealed to this Court. This

Court observed that the Respondents had failed to give the Petitioner a fair hearing of

meeting the objections raised by the Members of Parliament. Court also held that, it has

been repeatedly recognized that no man is to be deprived of his property without

having an opportunity of being heard. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that

the Petitioner was merely hoping against hope of being granted a renewal of his

license and held that he had a legitimate expectation of success, and therefore a right to

a full and fair opportunity of being heard.

In M.R.C.C. Ariyarathne and Others v. N.K. Illangakoon, IGP and Others (referred to

above), where a group of Development Assistants attached to the Police Department

claimed that they had a legitimate expectation of being absorbed to the Sri Lanka Police

Force or to one of its specialized units, Justice Prasanna Jayawardena provided the

following general description of procedural legitimate expectations:

Where a public authority, acting intra vires, has given an assurance that it will hear a

person before it changes its policy with regard to a matter which affects him or has stated

or otherwise made known its policy with regard to that matter or has an established

practice of holding a hearing before a change of policy is effected, that person will have a

procedural legitimate expectation, that the public authority will give him notice and a

reasonable and adequate opportunity to make representations and be heard before it

decides whether to change its policy with regard to the matter which will affect him. A

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 41

court will, by way of judicial review, enforce such a procedural legitimate expectation,

other than in limited circumstances such as, for example, where considerations of

national security override that expectation of being consulted or heard.

2.3.8.2 Substantive Legitimate Expectations

As the Petitioner in this matter is seeking relief on the premise that his substantive

legitimate expectation to receive a Letter of Intent from the 1st Respondent CEB and a

permit from the 2nd Respondent SLSEA had been frustrated, I propose to deal with

this area of law in some detail.

Recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is an instance which enables court

to review the decision which the public body was required to take (based on the

expectations it had generated through its own representations and past practices), as

opposed to procedure it should have followed when taking the decision. Thus, it goes

beyond the traditional scope of judicial review of examining procedural propriety and

enters into the controversial area of reviewing merits of the impugned decision.

After a period of uncertainty regarding the question as to whether the English law

recognizes the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations as opposed to

procedural legitimate expectations, in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority ex

parte Coughlan (referred to above), the Court of Appeal of England cleared the doubt

recognizing the non-justiciable frustration of substantive legitimate expectation as a

distinct ground for judicial review, resulting in the grant of relief aimed at quashing the

impugned decision of the public authority, as opposed to the procedure adopted by it

when arriving at the decision. This would result in the court being able to consider the

grant of substantive relief.

Lord Justice Laws in R (Niazi) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [(2008)

EWCA Civ. 755], held that, a substantive legitimate expectation arises only if there has

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 42

been a specific undertaking, directed at a particular individual or group, by which the

relevant policys continuance had been assured. He held that, a substantial legitimate

expectation would arise when an individual or a group who have substantial grounds

to expect that the substance of the relevant policy will continue to be in force for their

particular benefit: not necessarily forever, but at least for a reasonable period of time, to

provide a cushion against the change. In such situation, a change cannot lawfully be

made, certainly not made abruptly, unless the authority notifies and consults those who

would be adversely affected by such change.

The recognition of a substantive legitimate expectation offers not mere procedural

protection. It provides a degree of legal certainty about the nature and the merits of the

decision of the public authority which results in a particular outcome. The existence of a

procedural legitimate expectation imposes a requirement on the decision-maker to take

the decision in a particular manner. It does not impose a limitation on the exercise of

discretion on the decision to be taken or on the decision itself. (It is a restriction on how

to arrive at a decision and not a restriction on the decision itself.)

It must be noted that the recognition by court of substantive legitimate expectations has

an impact on the exercise of discretion by public authorities. It can give rise to the

decision-maker having to realize (give effect to) or honour the substantive expectation

of the person who entertained such expectation. Thus, the expectation of the claimant

would have to be realized. It may limit or completely take away discretion of the

decision-maker. Some may even argue that, judicial enforcement of a substantive

legitimate expectation of a claimant can result in the judiciary usurping the Executives

role. That is an argument sans merit, because when a court recognizes a substantive

legitimate expectation, it does not require the public authority to give effect to the

courts opinion on the matter. It merely requires the public authority to honour the

expectation it generated by its own representations or past practice.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 43

The concept of legal certainty provides a major justification for the recognition and

enforcement of substantive legitimate expectations. As stated earlier, legal certainty is a

component of the rule of law. The legal protection of expectations through the

application of principles of administrative law such as the doctrine of legitimate

expectations is a way of giving expression to the requirements of predictability,

certainty, formal equality, fairness and consistency, which are all facets inherent in the

rule of law, thus, its importance. However, legal certainty should be balanced with wider

public interest. What will ultimately be sanctioned by court is what is in public interest.

The sub-doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations arises in the following two

situations:

(i) A person who had been enjoying a benefit or advantage over a period of time,

claims that such advantage or benefit had been withdrawn in frustration of

his substantive legitimate expectation that the advantage or benefit will

continue. In this instance, the recognition of the substantive legitimate

expectation will preclude the decision-maker from exercising discretionary

authority and changing the outcome legitimately expected by the party which

entertained the expectation.

(ii) A person who is not presently enjoying a particular benefit or an advantage,

claims that while he rightfully expected such benefit or advantage to be

granted, in frustration of his expectation, the benefit or advantage he had

applied for has been denied. In this instance too, the recognition of the

substantive legitimate expectation will force the decision-maker to grant the

particular benefit or advantage that was rightfully expected by such party.

[The instant case falls into this category.]

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 44

Since the Coughlan case, the intensity with which courts have considered whether there

existed a substantive legitimate expectation, has decreased. There exists only a very

small category of cases where the stringent proportionality / balancing test applies. In

those cases, the public authority can (is entitled to) frustrate the substantive legitimate

expectation it created, only if the court is satisfied that the public interest in doing so

(deviating from the undertaking given) outweighs the unfairness that will thereby be

occasioned to the individual concerned. In such cases, a decision to frustrate a

substantive legitimate expectation will be held to be lawful provided the decision-

maker has (i) taken the expectation into account as part of its decision-making process,

(ii) reached a reasonable conclusion concerning the balance between the public and

private interests at stake, and (iii) respected any relevant conditions precedent, such as

having given due notice where it would be unfair not to do so. Unless these grounds are

satisfied, the public authority concerned will be required by court to honour its own

undertaking / representations and its part practices.

However, in the cases that were decided after the decision in Coughlan which include

the cases of R (Nadarajah) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department and R v

Secretary of State for Education and Employment ex parte Begbie (both cited above), the

courts view was that the test enumerated in Coughlan should be narrowly construed

by court. While accepting the test in Coughlan, the subsequent cases identified that

stringent criteria should be applied for the recognition by court of a substantive

legitimate expectation. Courts will look for the existence of an individualized promise

or a specific promised given to a small group, rather than a representation containing a

general statement of policy. Thus, there should be a specific undertaking or other

representation by the public authority to the claimant, such as in the nature of a specific

promise or a contractual undertaking.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 45

In R (Nadarajah) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [(2005), EWCA Civil

1363], it was held that, a public bodys promise or past practice as to future conduct

may be denied, in circumstances where to do so is the public bodys legal duty, or is

otherwise, to use a now familiar vocabulary, a proportionate response (of which the

court is the judge, or the last judge) having regard to a legitimate aim pursued by the

public body in the public interest. The principle that good administration requires

public authorities to be held to their promises would be undermined if the law did not

insist that any failure or refusal to comply is objectively justified as a proportionate

measure in the circumstances.

In United Policyholders Group v. Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago (referred to

above), Lord Carnwath while approving the tests in Coughlan, held that a claim for

substantive legitimate expectations should be honoured only where the claimant can

establish the following:

(i) That there was a promise or representation which is clear, unambiguous and

devoid of relevant qualification;

(ii) The promise was given to an identifiable, defined person or to a group by a

public authority;

(iii) The promise was given by the public authority for its own benefit, either in

return for action by the relevant person or group or on the basis of which the

person or group has acted to its detriment;

(iv) The authority cannot show good reasons, judged by the court to be

proportionate, to resile from the promise.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 46

2.3.8.4 Approach to be taken by Court when a claim of substantive legitimate

expectation is raised and established

When a claim of the existence of a substantive legitimate expectation is raised, as

observed in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan, court

may arrive at one out of the following three findings:

(i) though it has been submitted that the petitioner was entitled to a substantive

legitimate expectation of some benefit being awarded or not withdrawn, what

he was in fact entitled to was a procedural legitimate expectation (as opposed

to a substantial legitimate expectation) such as the granting of a fair hearing

or consultation before the impugned decision was taken. That is on the

footing that the criterion of legitimacy requires only procedural protection. In

other words, it is that all what the petitioner was legitimately entitled to was

procedurally fair treatment [e.g. R. v. Secretary of State for the Home

Department, ex parte Khan];

(ii) by holding that while the petitioner was entitled to a substantive legitimate

expectation (such as a conferral of a benefit or non-withdrawal of it), that

expectation should be protected only by requiring a fair procedure being

followed. That amounts to procedural protection of a substantive legitimate

expectation. This approach is adopted when there are countervailing factors

which necessitate the court to only insist on procedural fairness. This is when

the public interest favours the exercise of discretionary freedom;

(iii) situations where the court recognize the existence of an actual substantive

legitimate expectation, which is what the petitioner expected, and is entitled

to expect namely a particular substantive and legitimate outcome. This

results in the court requiring the decision-maker to confer on the petitioner a

particular benefit. In this situation, the discretionary freedom of the decision-

maker must give way to the principle of legal certainty. This will result in the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 47

decision-makers discretion being removed completely. Thus, courts are

cautious in applying this approach.

As stated previously, it is important to note that judicial thinking seems to recognize the

importance of limiting the circumstances in which substantive legitimate expectations

may arise. In the case of Ariyarathne, Justice Prasanna Jayawardane, expressing his

agreement with the views taken in R. v. Department of Education and Employment, ex

parte Begbie and R (Nadarajah) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (both

referred to above), held the following view:

In my view, these factors could make the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation an

unruly wayward horse if it is left to be guided only by the distinctly general guidelines set out

in Hamble (Offshore) Fisheries Ltd, Dayarathna and Coughlan.

In conclusion, it would be pertinent to note that, the essence of jurisprudence on this

matter supports the view that, in a case of substantive legitimate expectations, the

test of reviewing the decision of a public authority is no longer limited to the criteria

of Wednesbury unreasonableness. The courts task is to weigh genuine public interest

that would be protected by accommodating the personal interest of the claimant, and

decide on the legitimacy and the weight of the expectation of the claimant in

comparison with the reasons given by the public authority for the change of policy

on its part which it would invariably claim to also be in public interest. The court

must grant substantive relief, if in the opinion of the court, the public authority

having changed its policy is lawful and in wider public interest. That is not a means

of directing public institutions on what their policy ought to be. The approach of the

court is a means of preventing abuse of power by public authorities, and thereby,

protecting public interests, which is the bounden duty of courts.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 48

3.8.5 Does the frustration of a legitimate expectation constitute an infringement of

Article 12(1)?

The totality of the judicial precedent cited in this judgment and the available

jurisprudence both in this country and found in English Law pertaining to the doctrine

of legitimate expectations (both procedural and substantive) points towards one

direction. That is the conceptual basis for judicial review of the impugned decision, that

being the rationale that permitting the impugned decision to stand would be

inconsistent with rule of law, overlooking an instance of abuse of power, allowing an

unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious decision to stand, and contrary to the very

foundation of the law that being fairness. Time and again, this Court has observed

that the recognition of the equal protection of the law the right to equality would

necessitate this Court to rule that such legally flawed decisions which are contrary to

the rule of law, signify an instance of abuse of power, are irrational, capricious or

arbitrary or are so fundamentally unfair that the very foundations of justice and the

conscience of the court would be shockingly shaken, would amount to an infringement

of that fundamental right recognized by Article 12 of the Constitution. Thus, the

frustration of a legitimate expectation does amount to infringement of Article 12 and

specifically Article 12(1). This view on the impact of the frustration of a legitimate

expectation is recognized amongst others in Suranganie Marapana v. The Bank of

Ceylon and Others [(1997) 3 Sri L.R. 156], Dayarathna and Others v. Minister of Health

and Indigenous Medicine and Others (referred to above), Gunawardena v. Ceylon

Petroleum Corporation and Others [(2001) 1 Sri L.R. 231], Weerasekara v. Director-

General of Health Services and Others [(2003) 1 Sri L.R. 295], Sirimal and Others v.

Board of Directors of the Co-operative Wholesale Establishment and Others (referred to

above), Fernando and Others v. Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd and Others

[(2006) 3 Sri L.R. 141], and M.R.C.C. Ariyarathne and Others v. N.K. Illangakoon, IGP

and Others (referred to above). Thus, it is now necessary to conclude that the frustration

of a procedural or substantive legitimate expectation is a sui generis ground to hold that

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 49

an infringement of the fundamental right recognized by Article 12(1) of the Constitution

has occurred.

3. Position of the Petitioner

Vidullanka PLC is a public company incorporated in Sri Lanka, registered with and

approved by the Board of Investment, and is listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange.

Vidullanka PLC is engaged in the business of generation of electrical power through

renewable energy resources and selling such electricity to the 1st Respondent CEB. The

company has, directly and through subsidiary companies successfully completed

implementing several mini-hydropower projects and one project using biomass. It claims

without contest from the Respondents that it plays a significant role in the development

of the renewable energy generation capacity in Sri Lanka and significantly contributing

to the national electricity grid. On 14th May 2012, Vidullanka PLC incorporated the

Petitioner company - Vavuniya Solar Power (Private) Limited, as a subsidiary. The

purpose of incorporating this company was to carry out a solar energy-based electricity

generation project in Vavuniya, in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka.

On 20th April 2012, the Petitioner had submitted an Application to the 2nd Respondent

SLSEA for the purpose of obtaining approval for a solar energy-based electricity

generation plant (also referred to as a photovoltaic plant) to be commissioned in

Vavuniya. The expectation of the Petitioner was to obtain a permit under section 18 of

the SLSEA Act, to commission the electricity generation plant, and commence generating

electricity to be supplied to the national grid.

The project proposed by the Petitioner was to commission an electricity generation plant

(using solar energy) at the cost of the Petitioner, and for the electricity generated by the

plant to be supplied to the 1st Respondent CEB to be distributed via the national grid.

The 1st Respondent was to pay an agreed amount for electricity supplied to it by the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 50

Petitioner. For that purpose, the Petitioner was to enter into an agreement with the CEB

for the sale / purchase of electricity generated by the plant.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that prior to the submission of

this Application, a pre-feasibility study had been conducted and the Application for a

permit was submitted to the SLSEA, as it was deemed to be a viable project. Learned

Presidents Counsel also submitted that the Application (P3A) had been submitted to

the SLSEA in terms of section 16 of the SLSEA Act. The Application had been in

conformity with (a) provisions of the SLSEA Act, (b) the On-grid Renewable Energy

Projects Regulations of 2009 (P2A), (c) the Regulations of 2011 promulgated by the

Minister of Power and Energy in terms of section 67 read with 16(2), 17(2)(a) and 17(a)(2)

of the SLSEA Act (P2B), and (d) the Guidelines issued by the SLSEA titled A Guide to

the Projects approval process for On-Grid Renewable Energy Project Development (P2C).

Following the registration of the Application in terms of section 16(3) of the SLSEA Act

(Registration No. R 125550) and a preliminary screening of it by the SLSEA, by letter

dated 18th May 2012 (P3B) the Director General of SLSEA (5th Respondent) wrote to the

General Manager of the CEB (4th Respondent) bringing to his attention information

pertaining to 23 Applications received by the SLSEA seeking approval for renewable

energy (solar) power projects, which included the project submitted by the Petitioner.

While seeking information regarding the availability of grid capacity on the part of the

CEB (given the intended locations of the respective proposed electricity generation

projects), he sought the concurrence of the CEB to table the Applications pertaining to the

proposed projects at the forthcoming meeting of the PAC.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the afore-stated letter

amounted to the 5th Respondent having sought from the CEB a grid interconnection

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 51

concurrence for several proposed projects, including the project for which the Petitioner

had sought approval.

Subsequently, the Petitioner had been informed by the SLSEA that the CEB requires the

project for which the Petitioner sought approval to contain a battery storage system.

Therefore, the Petitioner had made necessary changes to the proposed project, and by

letter dated 19th November 2012 (P3C) informed the Deputy General Manager (Energy

Purchases) of the CEB, the Petitioners willingness to include a 8 megawatts battery

backup system as a solution to the problem highlighted by the CEB. The problem was

supposedly the short-term power variation in electricity generated by the proposed

project. That problem was sought to be resolved by the addition of a battery system to

ensure smooth power output at the grid end, so that sudden power drops could be

avoided. Through the said letter, the Petitioner had requested the CEB to provide the

grid interconnection concurrence for the project proposed by the Petitioner. Receiving

such concurrence would have enabled the SLSEA to consider granting provisional

approval for the project. By letter dated 21st November 2012 (P3D), without making

any adverse comment, the Deputy General Manager (Energy Purchases) of the CEB has

brought this matter to the attention of the Deputy General Manager (Transmission &

Generation Planning) of the CEB. The Petitioner claims that notwithstanding the

Petitioner having in November 2012 undertaken to amend the project specifications as

required by the CEB to include a battery backup system and several reminders having

been submitted to the CEB, till 2016 the CEB failed to grant the grid interconnection

concurrence to the intended amended project of the Petitioner (Reminders sent to the

CEB in this regard were produced by the Petitioner marked P3F, P3G and P3H).

On 15th February 2016, the SLSEA wrote to the CEB seeking grid interconnection

approval to the modified project proposed by the Petitioner. The modification (as

proposed by the Petitioner) was to transfer a minimum of 25% of energy generated

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 52

during the daytime to the night peak period via a battery storage system (P4A). By

letter dated 9th May 2016, the CEB informed the SLSEA that having taken into

consideration the innovative nature of the amended project, it has no objection for the

consideration of the project for the issue of a provisional approval by the SLSEA as a

pilot project (P4B). Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that this

letter amounted to the CEB having granted grid interconnection concurrence for the

Petitioners project. Learned Solicitor General for the Respondent did not object to that

contention.

Sequel thereto, on 19th May 2016, the SLSEA notified the Petitioner that in terms of section

17(2)(a) of the SLSEA Act, No. 35 of 2007, the PAC of the SLSEA had granted provisional

approval to the Petitioner to develop a 10 megawatts Solar PV Project with a battery

storage system to be located within the area coming within the Divisional Secretariat of

Vavuniya South. The Petitioner was required within 6 months from the date of that

notification, to submit the documents and information mentioned under items A and

B of Annexure I to the said notification, which were the conditions of the provisional

approval (P5A). For the provisional approval to be upgraded to the final or full

approval and the grant of a permit under section 18 of the Act, these conditions had to be

satisfied by the proponent of the project, (being the Petitioner). The notification contained

a caution that provisional approval will stand automatically cancelled if the afore-stated

requirements were not complied within 6 months or within a further period of 6 months

which could be obtained by presenting a request to the SLSEA. The afore-stated

conditions of the provisional approval granted to the amended project proposed by the

Petitioner contained inter alia a requirement that the Petitioner obtains from the 1st

Respondent a Letter of Intent which would indicate its willingness to purchase

electricity generated by the proposed project. That had been an administrative general

and imperative requirement imposed by the SLSEA to all project proponents.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 53

In view of the foregoing, the Petitioner applied for the issue of the several approvals

stipulated as conditions of the provisional approval issued by the SLSEA. On 26th July

2016, the Petitioner requested the CEB to issue a Letter of Intent (P7A). As the 1st

Respondent did not respond, two further requests were made on 29th August and 7th

November 2016 (P7B and P7C). As there was no response from the CEB

notwithstanding reminders being sent, by letter dated 14th September 2016 (P8A) the

Petitioner requested the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy to intervene in the

matter and advice the CEB to expedite the issuing of the Letter of Intent. Since there was

no positive outcome even from the Minister, yet another letter dated 10th November 2016

(P8B) had been sent by the Petitioner. Sequel thereto, the Minister had by letter dated

18th November 2016 (P8C) advised the CEB to expedite the issuing of the Letter of

Intent and the Electricity Purchase Agreement. Nevertheless, there had been no

positive response from the CEB notwithstanding the Ministers intervention.

As there was a delay in obtaining necessary approvals, including the Letter of Intent

from the CEB, by an Application to the SLSEA, the Petitioner had obtained an extension

of the validity period of the provisional approval, up to 18th May 2017 (P5B).

Learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the provisional approval granted to the

project by the SLSEA was a clear indication that the CEB had granted grid

interconnection concurrence and an indication that the CEB being the electricity

transmission and bulk supply licensee had been satisfied of its ability to accept electricity

generated by the project proposed by the Petitioner. In terms of clause 2.3 of the

Guidelines, such a decision would have been taken by the CEB upon a careful evaluation

of technical factors such as the systemwide impacts, network typology and system

stability, in addition to more commonly understood constraints such as local

transmission grid limitations and limitations in capacity at the grid sub-station.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 54

Subsequently, the Petitioner had obtained all the required approvals as contained in

Annexure I of P5A, except the Letter of Intent from the CEB. The Petitioner produced

marked P6A to P6H the other approvals obtained by the Petitioner, as per the

conditions contained in the provisional approval issued by the SLSEA. Thus, the only

requirement that stood in the way towards the Petitioner obtaining the final approval (a

permit under section 18 of the SLSEA Act) from the SLSEA, was the Letter of Intent to

be issued by the CEB.

In the meantime, in November 2016, at a meeting held with the 1st Respondent, it had

been intimated to the Petitioner that the project would be accepted if the project is

changed to its original form (i.e. solar power electricity generation without a battery

storage system). The Petitioner agreed to do so. The CEB has not given any reason for the

change in the technical requirement previously sanctioned by it. Consequently, by letter

dated 17th November 2016 (P9), the Petitioner informed the SLSEA of the change of

position by the CEB and requested the SLSEA to grant an extension as per the original

Solar PV Application made. The SLSEA refused to change the provisional approval

without a direction from the CEB. Therefore, by letter dated 1st December 2016 (P10A),

the Petitioner requested the CEB to issue a directive to the SLSEA to issue an amended

provisional approval from a Solar PV with a Battery Storage System to a Solar PV

System (which amounted to the original project proposal submitted by the Petitioner

a system without a battery backup). By letter dated 1st December 2016, the CEB informed

the SLSEA that it has no objection to the project type being changed to a Solar PV project

(P10B). Sequel thereto, by letter dated 20th December 2016 (P11), the SLSEA notified

the Petitioner the grant of an amended provisional approval from a Solar PV with

battery storage to a Solar PV (without a battery storage system) project.

By letter dated 26th December 2016 (P12), the Petitioner wrote to the CEB seeking a

Letter of Intent for the further revised project (original project proposal a system

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 55

without a battery backup). Since there was no response from the CEB, on 16th February

2017, the Petitioner in partial compliance with the conditions contained in the

provisional approval, submitted the requisite approvals that were available (other than

the Letter of Intent to be issued by the CEB) to the SLSEA. This submission (P13)

contained a request that the final approval for the project be issued along with a permit

in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act. While the 2nd Respondent did not issue a permit

to the Petitioner, by letter dated 1st March 2017 (P14) addressed to the General Manager

of the CEB (at the time the 4th Respondent), the SLSEA requested the CEB to issue a Letter

of Intent for the project of the Petitioner. As there was no response from the CEB, on 7th

March 2017, the Petitioner once again urged the 4th Respondent to issue a Letter of Intent

(P15). In the said letter, the Petitioner sought reasons if any, for the delay in issuing the

Letter of Intent. In response, the Chairman of the CEB by letter dated 22nd March 2017

(P16) informed the Petitioner that the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy had

appointed a committee headed by the Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy to

review and report on suitable decisions to be taken with regard to all matters pertaining

to Applications for provisional approvals and Letters of Intent that are being processed

either at the CEB or at the SLSEA, and that in the circumstances the project of the

Petitioner would come within the scope of that committee. The Chairman of the CEB (3rd

Respondent) had undertaken to revert to the Petitioner as soon as a direction is issued

by the Ministry.

The Petitioner claims that neither the said committee nor the CEB had thereafter informed

the Petitioner of any reasons for the non-issuance of the Letter of Intent. It is the

Petitioners position that there is no valid reason for the non-issuance of the said letter.

As opposed to the position taken up by the 1st Respondent (CEB) regarding the reason

for the non-issuance of the Letter of Intent, the Petitioner has asserted that, in terms of

section 6 of the Guidelines (P2C) issued by the 2nd Respondent (SLSEA) there exists a

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 56

Standardised Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) for renewable energy projects of the

approved types, with an installed capacity of up to 10 MW. The SPPA is a standardised

and non-negotiable Agreement that the CEB enters into with project proponents which

stipulates the price at which the CEB will purchase electricity from the project proponent.

This tariff has been approved by the PUCSL. The Petitioners position is that the project

proposed by the Petitioner comes within the scope of that Agreement. Therefore, the

Petitioners position is that, as the capacity of the Petitioners project is 10 MW, there is

no requirement to negotiate the terms and tariffs according to which electricity generated

from the project is to be purchased by the 1st Respondent (CEB) as they are regulated in

terms of the Standardised Power Purchase Agreement. Thus, the Petitioner claims that

the 1st Respondent (CEB) does not have any discretion in the matter of granting the Letter

of Intent to the Petitioner, who had already obtained provisional approval founded

upon the 1st Respondent (CEB) issuing grid interconnection concurrence.

4. Position of the Respondents

2nd Respondent Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority - According to the 5th

Respondent (in his capacity as the Deputy Director General (Operations) of the Sri

Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority 2nd Respondent, in terms of section 13 of the Act,

it is the Authority that is responsible for the development of all renewable energy

resources in Sri Lanka, with the view to obtaining maximum economic utilization of

those resources. With this objective, the Authority has published Regulations (P2A

and P2B) and Guidelines (P2C) to regulate the procedure for application and the

granting of approvals for renewable energy projects. In terms of section 16 of the Act,

the Director General of the Authority is required to accept Applications for

development of renewable energy projects and submit them to the PAC for its

consideration. Up until 2018, the Authority had successfully achieved targets pertaining

to sustainable energy projects, based on the least cost long-term generation expansion

plan of the government, which has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. When

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 57

developing renewable energy projects, there are special considerations to be given by

balancing environmental factors and social benefits. According to the SLSEA, it is

awaiting grid concurrence from the CEB for a number of Applications it had received.

The 5th Respondent has presented marked 2R1, minutes of the PAC meetings held on

19th May and 23rd June 2016. According to 2R1, at the meeting of the Committee held

on 19th May 2016 (at which M.C. Wickramasekara, the then General Manager, CEB was

present), the Solar PV Project with Battery Storage System with a capacity of 10

megawatts submitted by the Petitioner has been approved for the issuance of a

provisional approval. At the subsequent meeting of the PAC held on 23rd June 2016, no

decision had been taken pertaining to the project proposal submitted by the Petitioner.

According to the 5th Respondent, the 6th Respondent Secretary to the Ministry has by

letters dated 4th May 2016 (2R2) and 20th July 2017 (2R3) issued certain directives to

the Authority. By 2R2 the Secretary has informed the Authority that the government

has given high priority for the development of renewable energy envisaged for the

future development of the country. He has highlighted the need to identify suitable

methodologies to fast-track the development process. He has asserted the need to

streamline the project approval process and immediate intervention of the Authority to

speed up implementation of projects. By 2R3, the Secretary has notified the Authority

that the Ministry intends to amend the SLE Act to enable the development of renewable

energy projects under the SLSEA Act, and pending such action being taken, approval

has been granted in terms of section 17(c) of the SLE Act to implement certain electricity

generation programmes (specified in that letter).

1st Respondent Ceylon Electricity Board - According to the 4th Respondent (General

Manager, CEB), in terms of the SLE Act, the sole authority to offer the Standardised

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 58

Power Purchase Agreement is the CEB, and the right to purchase generated electricity

also lies solely with the CEB, which is recognized as the sole transmission licensee.

Referring to the Application submitted by the Petitioner on or about the 20th April 2012

under section 16 of the Act, the 4th Respondent has asserted that the Petitioner has not

complied with the requirement set-out in section 16 of the Act and in Gazette

notifications bearing Nos. 1599/6 and 1705/22 (pertaining to on-grid Renewable

Projects) dated 27th April 2009 and 10th May 2011, respectively. That is on the footing

that as at the date of the Application, the Petitioner had not been incorporated as a

company and thus was not in existence. Instead, the Application contained a reference

to the fact that the company was in the process of incorporation. According to the

Certificate of Incorporation, the Petitioner company had been incorporated on 14th May

2012. Thus, the Petitioner had submitted an irregular Application. Further, when the

applicant is a company, it is incumbent on the company to tender a Resolution of the

company authorizing the applicant to submit an Application. This requirement had also

not been complied with.

The 4th Respondent admits that, following the 1st Respondent issuing the Grid

Interconnection Concurrence in respect of the Application submitted by the Petitioner,

on or about 19th May 2016, the 2nd Respondent issued the provisional approval to the

project of the Petitioner. The 4th Respondent agrees with the position taken up by the

Petitioner that the grant of final approval was contingent upon the submission of

certain documents and information stipulated in Annexure I of the document

containing the provisional approval. Of such requirements, one was obtaining the

Letter of Intent from the 1st Respondent, and tendering it to the 2nd Respondent within

6 months from the issuance of the provisional approval. If the requirements attached

to the provisional approval were not satisfied and submitted to the 2nd Respondent or

the requirements contained in the provisional approval were not satisfied at all, in

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 59

terms of section 17(c) of the SLSEA Act, the provisional approval will automatically

stand cancelled at the end of the 6th months period, or a further 6 months period, which

may be obtained upon a request being made in that regard. This position is also

contained in page 12 of the Guidelines to On-Grid Renewable Energy Development

Projects (P2C). The Petitioner is deemed to have been fully aware that the final

approval and the permit will be contingent upon his obtaining inter-alia a Letter of

Intent from the 1st Respondent, which the Petitioner had failed to obtain.

On application by the Petitioner, the time period originally granted by the 2nd

Respondent to comply with the requirements was extended by another 6 months, and

the extended period was to expire on 18th May 2017. Three days prior to the expiry of

the said period, on 15th May 2017 the Petitioner filed the instant Fundamental Rights

Application in the Supreme Court in order to prevent the extended period of the

provisional approval granted by the 2nd Respondent from automatically lapsing.

The appropriate cause of action where a party fails to obtain a Letter of Intent is to

bring the matter to the attention of the 1st Respondent. The 4th Respondent admits that

the Petitioner had done so by way of submitting a letter, to which the 1st Respondent

had responded by letter dated 22nd March 2017, stating that the Minister of Power &

Renewable Energy had appointed a committee to take a decision on the matter. The

matter pertaining to the Petitioner was pending deliberation by the Committee as at the

time the instant Application was filed. In terms of section 22(1)(b) of the SLSEA Act, any

person aggrieved by a refusal to grant final approval to an Application may within one

month of the receipt of such communication, appeal against the refusal to the Board of

Management. Furthermore, in terms of section 28 of the Act, the Petitioner could have

presented an appeal to the Board. By instituting this action, the Petitioner has

circumvented the proper forum to obtain redress and has petitioned the Supreme

Court, without seeking administrative relief.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 60

In response to the allegation pertaining to the non-granting of the Letter of Intent to

the Petitioner, the 4th Respondent has taken up the following positions:

(i) Due to technical reasons that are common or specific to Solar PV and Wind

Power electricity generation plants, the 1st Respondent has stopped issuing

Letters of Intent. There are constraints in interconnection of these power

plants to the transmission system. Therefore, in 2012, the 1st Respondent did

not issue to the 2nd Respondent (SLSEA) concurrence for grid interconnection

in respect of the project of the Petitioner. However, with grid and system

expansion, these constraints can be relaxed or changed.

(ii) The 1st Respondent (CEB) stopped issuing Letters of Intent to wind and solar

projects until the grid connection limitations and effects on the system were

studied. A study in this regard was conducted by the 1st Respondent and its

report is contained in the Integration of non-conventional renewable energy-

based generation into Sri Lanka Power-Grids. (4R1) According to this

study, only 10 MW solar projects have been considered viable for Vavuniya.

(iii) Following the amendment to the SLE Act by Act No. 31 of 2013, procurement

of electricity should be done on a competitive basis. This encourages lower

electricity cost, ultimately helping customers and the national economy.

(iv) The Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy has decided on a policy of

calling for tenders for wind and solar power projects.

(v) No Letter of Intent has been issued since August 2013, except for one

project, that being a joint venture between a private project proponent and

the CEB.

According to the 4th Respondent, (a) the 1st Respondent did not initially issue a grid

connection concurrence for the project of the Petitioner, since there was an issue of

technical infeasibility in connecting, (b) the 1st Respondent thereafter issued the grid

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 61

connection concurrence as the technology was changed to battery storage and as the

system had expanded, and (c) the 1st Respondent did not issue the Letter of Intent as

(i) there were further issues to be reviewed in the technical matters with regard to the

grid connections, (ii) due to the policy decision to go for tendering in solar power

projects and (iii) due to legal issues relating to the SLE Act.

The 4th Respondent has taken up the position that in terms of the SLE Act, the sole

authority for offering a Standardised Power Purchase Agreement is the 1st Respondent

(CEB). He further emphasizes that the right to purchase electricity lies solely with the

electricity transmission licensee, being the CEB.

5. Submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner

Learned Presidents Counsel submitted that following certain preliminary work such as

conducting a pre-feasibility study, on 20th April 2012 the Petitioner had submitted an

Application to the Director General of SLSEA (5th Respondent) seeking approval for an

on-grid electricity generation project. This Application had been in conformity with all

the stipulations of the applicable provisions of the law and requirements contained in

the guidelines.

Following a preliminary screening of the Application, the 2nd Respondent (SLSEA) in

consultation with the 1st Respondent (CEB) registered the Application submitted by the

Petitioner, and issued a registration number, being R 125550. This was in terms of

section 16(3) of the SLSEA Act. He submitted that, this showed clearly that the

Application submitted by the Petitioner was prima-facie valid and acceptable to the 2nd

Respondent. On or about 18th May 2012, on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, the 5th

Respondent (Director General, SLSEA) requested the 1st Respondent to provide grid

interconnection concurrence for the project proposed by the Petitioner and for several

other projects. To facilitate the consideration of the Application for the issue of grid

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 62

interconnection concurrence and provisional approval for the project, the 2nd

Respondent had submitted the Application of the Petitioner to the PAC of the SLSEA.

Contingent upon the 1st Respondent granting grid interconnection concurrence to the

project (which is an indication of the CEBs ability to accept to its grid, the electricity

generated by the project), the project was to receive provisional approval. Learned

Presidents Counsel drew the attention of Court to section 2.3 of the afore-mentioned

Guidelines (P2C), which provides that as the transmission and bulk supply licensee,

the CEB will have to (based on a careful evaluation of system wide impacts, network

topology and system stability, in addition to the more commonly understood

constraints such as local transmission grid limitations and grid substation capacity

limitations), be satisfied with the ability of the CEB to accept electricity produced by the

proposed project.

He further submitted that the PAC comprises of several government officials (as

specified in section 10 of the SLSEA Act), and includes the General Manager of the 1st

Respondent -CEB.

Learned Presidents Counsel further submitted that, the original proposal was for the

establishments of a Solar PV Power Generation Project. Following a response received

from the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioner having consulted its technical partner, had

converted the proposed project into a Solar PV Power Generation Project with a Battery

Storage System. The Petitioner had verily believed that if the project was converted in

that manner (i.e. the enhancement of the project to contain a battery storage system),

approval would be given for the project. That the Petitioner would amend the proposed

project to include a battery storage system was conveyed to the 1st Respondent by letter

dated 19th November 2012 (P3C).

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 63

Notwithstanding the Petitioner making a number of representations to the 1st

Respondent, till 2016, no meaningful action was taken by the 1st Respondent. The post-

argument written submissions of the Petitioner contain an allegation that

notwithstanding the project proposal submitted by the Petitioner having been the only

Solar PV power project proposal received by the 2nd Respondent for the Northern

Province and ranked number one in the Northern Province for grid interconnection,

instead of granting grid interconnection concurrence for the project of the Petitioner, the

1st Respondent had granted approval for a solar - thermal project of 10 MW capacity for

the Vavuniya district submitted by another applicant. After a long delay in processing

the Application, and no reasons being given for the delay, on 9th May 2016 (P4B) the

5th Respondent (on behalf of the CEB - 1st Respondent) informed the Director General of

the SLSEA - 4th Respondent that the CEB had no objection for consideration of the

project for the issue of provisional approval which was understandably subject to the

Petitioner complying with certain conditions. This amounted to the CEB - 1st

Respondent granting grid interconnection concurrence to the amended project

submitted by the Petitioner. Accordingly, by letter dated 19th May 2016 (P5A) the

SLSEA - 2nd Respondent granted provisional approval. As provisional approval was

granted, the Petitioner verily believed that upon satisfaction of the conditions attached

to the provisional approval the 1st and 2nd Respondents would give approval for the

project. Originally, a period of 6 months was given to the Petitioner to comply with the

requirements, and on request by the Petitioner, another period of 6 months was given.

It was contended on behalf of the Petitioner that in terms of section 6 of the Guidelines

(P2C), a Standardised Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) is available for the

renewable energy generation projects which have received approval, with an installed

capacity of up to 10 megawatts. The proposed project of the Petitioner belongs to this

category. This SPPA is standardised and non-negotiable, and is valid for 20 years from

the date of the commencement of commercial operations. Such projects are also eligible

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 64

to be paid under the Small Power Purchase Tariff (SPPT). The SPPT is an approved

tariff published by the PUCSL.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that where the capacity of a

proposed electricity generation project (such as the project proposed by the Petitioner)

is equal or less than 10 megawatts, there is no requirement to negotiate the terms and

tariffs of the Standardised Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA). He further submitted

that this position was evident by section 6 of the Guidelines (P2C) which relates to

Power Purchase Agreements and Tariffs. Further, with the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers (approval granted on 7th March 2015) following the enactment of the SLE

(Amendment) Act, No. 31 of 2013), a standardised tariff for solar power purchases

under a Non-conventional Renewable Energy Tariff has been published by the 1st

Respondent CEB. Since the grid interconnection concurrence was given by the 1st

Respondent CEB to the Petitioner prior to the issuance of the provisional approval

by the 2nd Respondent SLSEA, the 1st Respondent does not have in fact and in law a

discretion in providing the Letter of Intent. He further submitted that there is no

Standardised Power Purchase Agreement for renewable energy generation projects

which generate in excess of 10 megawatts, and thus, for those projects following a

competitive bidding process based on the normal procurement policies is necessary.

It was submitted that the conduct of the Respondents coupled with the communications

received from the Respondents and the Guidelines (P2C), gave rise to a legitimate

expectation that the Petitioner would be entitled to receive a Letter of Intent from the

CEB 1st Respondent, upon the Petitioner securing all the other approvals. It was

therefore submitted that, even after fulfilling all the requirements contained in the

provisional approval (P5A) (i.e. obtaining all the approvals listed as conditions to be

satisfied in P5A, other than the Letter of Intent) and the Petitioner having on 26th

July 2016 (P7A) requested the 1st / 4th Respondents to issue a Letter of Intent (and

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 65

thereafter having sent two reminders), the failure on the part of the 1st Respondent to

issue the Letter of Intent constitutes a breach of the legitimate expectation of the

Petitioner.

He further submitted that under section 43(4) proviso (b) of the SLE Act (as amended by

Act No. 31 of 2013), it was not necessary for the 1st Respondent CEB to call for tenders

with regard to projects in respect of which a permit has been issued under section 18 of

the SLSEA Act. He also drew the attention of the Court to the contents of section 43(7)

and 43(8) of the SLE Act (amended by Act No. 31 of 2013), which recognize a

Standardised Power Purchase Agreement.

In view of the foregoing, learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that,

there was absolutely no restriction for the 1st Respondent under the SLE Act (as

amended) to purchase electricity from a developer approved under the SLSEA Act, as

there is no legal requirement for tenders for such projects.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner summed up his submissions by stating

that the non-issuance of the Letter of Intent to the Petitioner was wrongful and without

justifiable reason. Learned Presidents Counsel reiterated that the conduct of the

Respondents coupled with the communications received from the Respondents gave rise

to a legitimate expectation that the Petitioner would be entitled to receive a Letter of

Intent upon the Petitioner securing all the other approvals. Learned Presidents Counsel

submitted that the continuing failure which amounts to a refusal to issue the Letter of

Intent to the Petitioner is arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and discriminatory. In the

circumstances, he submitted that the Petitioner has been denied the equal protection of

the law as envisaged by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Thus, he submitted that the

fundamental right guaranteed in terms of Article 12(1) had been infringed by the 1st

Respondent.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 66

6. Submissions made on behalf of the Respondents

On behalf of the Respondents, it was submitted by the learned Solicitor General that the

instant Application alleging an infringement of the Fundamental Rights of the

Petitioner, had been filed prematurely. He submitted that, initially a period of six

months was given by the SLSEA for the Petitioner to comply with the conditions that

were attached to the provisional approval (which was issued on 19th May 2016).

Subsequently, on a request made by the Petitioner, this period of time was extended by

another six months. Accordingly, the extended period granted to the Petitioner to

comply with the requirements was to end on 18th May 2017. Had the Petitioner failed to

satisfy the conditions that were attached to the provisional approval at the time of the

expiry of this extended period, in terms of section 17(4) of the SLSEA Act, the

provisional approval granted to the Petitioner would have lapsed. This Application

has been submitted to the Supreme Court on 15th May 2017, three days before the

extended period was to have lapsed. Learned Solicitor General submitted that the

Petitioner resorted to this move, in order to prevent the provisional approval from

lapsing. Therefore, he submitted that the instant Application had been filed to prevent

the provisional approval from automatically lapsing and was also premature.

Learned Solicitor General also submitted that as the Petitioner has been unsuccessful in

obtaining the Letter of Intent from the CEB, he should have brought that matter to the

attention of the CEB. That the Petitioner has done. The CEB responded explaining the

reason which prevented the CEB from granting the Letter of Intent, i.e. the Minister of

Power and Renewable Energy has appointed a committee headed by the Secretary to

the Ministry of Power and Energy to determine the said matter. In terms of section

22(1)(b) of the SLSEA Act, any person who is aggrieved by a refusal to grant final

approval to an Application may, within one month of the receipt of such

communication informing him of such refusal, appeal against such refusal to the Board

of Management of the SLSEA. This step has not been taken by the Petitioner. Thus,

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 67

learned Solicitor General submitted that due to the afore-stated reasons, the instant

Application is premature and should be dismissed.

Learned Solicitor General submitted that in 2012, it was due to grid interconnection

issues that concurrence for grid interconnection was not given by the 1st Respondent -

CEB to the 2nd Respondent - SLSEA in respect of the Petitioners project. The CEB

stopped giving Letters of intent to wind and solar projects until the grid connection

limitations and effects on the system were studied. According to a study conducted by

the CEB, only 10 MW solar projects had been considered viable for Vavuniya. He

further submitted that with grid expansion and system expansion, these constraints can

be relaxed or changed.

Learned counsel for the Respondents also submitted that, following the amendment to

the SLE Act introduced by Act No. 31 of 2013, in terms of amended section 43 and in

particular sub-sections 43(3) and 43(4), procurement of electricity by the CEB with

regard to projects above 5 MW has to be done on a competitive basis by calling for

tenders. He explained that the process of competitive bidding encourages lower

electricity cost, which ultimately helps consumers and also the national economy. In the

circumstances, the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy had decided on a policy of

calling for tenders for wind and solar electricity generation projects. Accordingly,

tenders had been called for two 10 megawatts wind projects and contracts had been

awarded. Tenders for sixty 10 megawatt solar projects had been called and award of

tenders were being considered. Since 2013, no Letters of Intent had been issued except

for a single joint venture. It is the position of the Respondents that according to 4R2,

with regard to projects which are to generate over 5 megawatts of electricity, project

development has to take place through a tender process. Thus, a competitive bidding

process must be adhered to. As evident from 4R1, the Honourable Attorney General

has expressed the opinion that when new electricity generation plants are required, in

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 68

terms of the amended law, the price at which electricity is to be purchased by the CEB

(in its capacity as the transmission licensee) must be determined by competitive

bidding. In terms of section 43(3) of the Act, the selection of a person to provide

electricity should be on the basis of least cost.

Learned Solicitor General submitted that the Application of the Petitioner was

submitted to the SLSEA on 20th April 2012, well before Act No. 31 of 2013 amended

section 43 of the Act. He stressed that though on 19th May 2016, provisional approval

was granted for the project proposed by the Petitioner, the CEB was well within the scope

of the said Amendment and the opinion expressed by the Honourable Attorney General to

scrupulously adhere to the provisions of section 43(4) and not issue the letter of intent. He

further submitted that the sole reason for not issuing the Letter of Intent was that

amended section 43(4) of the Act required competitive bidding to take place prior to

entering into an agreement between the CEB and the project proponent. He concluded

his submission by asserting that the CEB cannot be faulted or censured for obeying the law,

as any contravention of it would entail legal sanctions and implications for the CEB. There was

no malicious intent on the part of the CEB in denying the Petitioner of the letter of intent. It was

the supervening event of the law being amended, that prevented the CEB from performing the

role envisaged by the Petitioner.

7. Analysis of the evidence, application of the law and conclusions

7.1 Would the Petitioner be disentitled to any relief on the footing that as at the time

the Application for a permit was submitted to the SLSEA by the petitioner, it had not

been incorporated as a company?

Section 16 of the SLSEA Act which provides for the submission of an Application to the

SLSEA by a person who is desirous of engaging in and carrying on an on-grid

renewable energy project, does not specify that such an applicant should be a company

incorporated under the Companies Act. Thus, there is no statutory requirement to that

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 69

effect, though the 4th Respondent has made such an assertion. However, Gazette

notifications Nos. 1599/6 (P2A) and 1705/22 (P2B) dated 27th April 2009 and 10th

May 2011, respectively, titled On-grid Renewable Energy Projects Regulations, 2009

issued by the Minister of Power and Energy under section 67 read with sections 16(2),

17(2)(a) and 18(2)(a) of the of the SLSEA Act, are relevant in this regard. Schedules A, B,

C, and D of P2A issued in April 2009 had been replaced by four schedules contained

in P2B, which had been issued in May 2011. Thus, it would be P2A read with P2B

that would be relevant to the instant matter. Regulation 2 of P2A provides that an

application for engaging in or carrying on of an on-grid renewable energy project within a

Development Area, shall be submitted to the Director-General in such form as specified in

Schedule A to these Regulations . Schedule A of the said Regulations contain a

template of the Application to be submitted. In item 4(ii) of Schedule A of P2A, the

applicant is required to disclose the Company Name (if applicable). In item 3 of P2B

the applicant is required to disclose If the applicant is a Company: Name, Registration No.,

Name of Directors of the Company, Address, Telephone Numbers, Email. It is thus apparent

that the applicant being an incorporated company at the time of the submission of the

Application is not an essential requirement imposed by law or through Regulations

issued under the Act. Furthermore, Clause 2.1 of the guidelines issued by the SLSEA

titled A Guide to the Project Approval Process for On-grid Renewable Energy Project

Development (P2C) provides that Any person (an individual or a company) may apply for

a renewable energy project anytime . According to section 9(1)(c) of the SLE Act, a

generation licensee is required to be an incorporated company, only if the project is to

generate more than 25 megawatts of electricity. It is also pertinent to observe that,

notwithstanding the alleged disqualification asserted to on behalf of the 1st Respondent

CEB and referred to in the submissions of the learned Solicitor General, the SLSEA

had entertained the Application submitted by the Petitioner and processed it. Further,

this objection was not raised by the 2nd Respondent SLSEA, which not only accepted

the Application, but processed it as well, and referred it to the PAC. Furthermore, in

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 70

any event, even though the Petitioner had not been incorporated as a company as at the

date on which the Application was submitted by it to the SLSEA (i.e. 20th April 2012), as

apparent by P1A (Certificate of Incorporation), by 14th May 2012 it had been

incorporated as a company. In fact, the Petitioner has revealed in the said Application

(P3A) that the company was in the process of incorporation.

7.2 Would the Petitioner be disentitled to any relief on the footing that the Application

submitted by the Petitioner to the SLSEA was not accompanied by a Resolution

adopted by the Board of Directors of the Petitioner authorizing the person who

submitted the Application, to submit it on behalf of the company?

Section 16 of the SLSEA Act does not impose a statutory requirement that if the

applicant is a company, the Application should be accompanied by a Resolution

adopted by the Board of Directors authorizing the person submitting the Application to

the SLSEA to submit such an Application on behalf of the company. However, P2B

contains the following: Company resolution authorizing the applicant to submit the

application (pls. attach). As stated above, as at the time the Application was submitted,

the Petitioner company had not been incorporated. It was under incorporation. Thus,

complying with the afore-stated requirement was not possible. P2B has been issued

by the Minister under section 67 (power conferred on the Minister to make

Regulations), read with section 16(2) (which provides that an Application should be in

the prescribed form). While compliance with the requirements contained in these

Regulations is necessary, acquiescence with a possible non-compliance will thereby

prevent the party which acquiesced from subsequently raising any objection to the

alleged non-compliance. As referred to above, it is seen that the 2nd Respondent

SLSEA has accepted the Application presented by the Petitioner (P3A) and processed

it. The 1st Respondent CEB (which raised the objection referred to in this paragraph)

took part in the further processing of the said Application and supported the granting

of the provisional approval to the Application. Thus, the 4th Respondent is disentitled

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 71

in law to object to the Application submitted to the SLSEA by the Petitioner on the

footing that the Application was irregular.

Conclusions with regard to questions 7.1 and 7.2

It is to be noted that, even according to the 4th Respondent, that the Petitioner was not

issued with a permit under section 18 of the SLSEA Act, was not due to the alleged

submission of an irregular Application. Furthermore, in none of the correspondence

either the 1st Respondent CEB or the 2nd Respondent SLSEA has had with the

Petitioner, has either of the Respondents referred to the Petitioner having submitted an

irregular Application. At no point prior to this Application being filed in the Supreme

Court has the 4th Respondent raised the issue that the Application presented to the 2nd

Respondent - SLSEA was defective. In fact, it is astonishing that the 4th Respondent who

served in the PAC which granted provisional approval to the Petitioner did not raise

this issue at that stage. In all these circumstances, it is my view that the afore-stated two

objections raised on behalf of the 1st Respondent - CEB by the 4th Respondent are

without merit, and must be ruled as futile attempts not made in good faith, to prevent

the instant Application presented to this Court being adjudicated upon based on its

merits and the applicable substantive law. In the circumstances, I must reject in-limine

the assertions made by the 4th Respondent and the corresponding submissions made by

the learned Solicitor General that the instant Application should be dismissed on the

footing that the Application submitted to the SLSEA was an irregular Application.

7.3 Did the Petitioner file the instant Application before the Supreme Court

prematurely, without having sought administrative relief prior to filing the

Application?

The extended period of the provisional approval granted on 19th May 2016 by the

SLSEA to the application for a permit under section 18 of the SLSEA Act, was to have

lapsed on 18th May 2017. Prior to the said date, on 15th May 2017 the Petitioner filed the

instant Application in this Court. On behalf of the 1st Respondent CEB the 4th

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 72

Respondent alleges that on the one hand the instant Application was filed to prevent

the extended period of the provisional approval from lapsing and on the other hand

without having recourse to administrative reliefs provided for in sections 22(1)(b) and

28 of the SLSEA Act.

Section 22(1)(b) of the SLSEA Act provides that any person who is aggrieved by a refusal to

grant final approval to an application may, within one month of the receipt of the

communication informing him of such refusal , appeal against such refusal to the Board.

It is necessary to emphatically observe that, in the instant case, at no time did the SLSEA

inform the Petitioner that it had taken a decision to refuse to grant final approval to the

Application submitted to it by the Petitioner. Thus, the need to seek administrative

relief in terms of section 22(1)(b) did not arise. In fact, the last communication received

from the SLSEA (P14 letter dated 1st March 2017 addressed to the General Manager of

the CEB and copied to the Petitioner) gives a positive impression, in that the only

requirement to be satisfied by the Petitioner to be issued with the final approval was the

Letter of Intent to be issued by the CEB, and requesting the CEB to issue such a letter

in favour of the Petitioner. In the circumstances, the Petitioner had no reason to believe

that the SLSEA had taken a decision or was going to refuse to grant final approval to

the Application submitted by the Petitioner seeking a permit under section 18 of the

SLSEA Act. Thus, there is no basis in law to fault the Petitioner for not having sought

administrative relief under section 22(1)(b) of the SLSEA Act.

Section 28 of the SLSEA Act provides as follows:

(1) Any person who is aggrieved by (a) the refusal of the Committee to grant a permit for an

off-grid renewable energy project; or (b) the cancellation under section 27 of a permit issued, may

appeal against such decision to the Board.

(2) Any person who is aggrieved by the decision of the Board on any appeal made under

subsection (1), may appeal against such decision to the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister,

whose decision thereon shall be final.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 73

It is clearly observable that, the mechanism of addressing an administrative appeal

provided for in section 28 pertains and is restricted to the two situations referred to in

paragraphs (a) and (b) above. The instant Application presented by the Petitioner to

the SLSEA pertains to an on-grid renewable energy electricity generation project and

not to an off-grid project. Furthermore, the matter complained of to this Court by the

Petitioner does not relate to a cancellation of a permit issued under section 27 of the

SLSEA Act.

In the circumstances, I conclude that, there is no basis for the 4th Respondent

whatsoever to complain that the Petitioner had filed the instant Application without

having recourse to the administrative relief mechanisms provided in sections 22(1)(b)

and 28 of the Act. I must express concern as to how such an objection entered the

affidavit of the 4th Respondent, without legal scrutiny, which if took place, would not

have resulted in permitting the 4th Respondent to take up such position.

Indeed, the Petitioner has filed the instant Application 3 days prior to the extended

period of the provisional approval from lapsing. That in my opinion is perfectly within

the legitimate entitlement of the Petitioner. In a matter that has administratively

dragged on since April 2012 up to May 2017, the Petitioner was perfectly within his

entitlement to have preferred the instant Application on the date it did. The Petitioner

has filed this Application sequel to the last communication received from the 1st

Respondent CEB on 22nd March 2017 (P16), from which it appears that the Petitioner

formed the view that, given the previous developments, no useful purpose would be

met by pursuing any further, the administrative route to obtain a permit under section

18 of the SLSEA Act. Thus, there is no basis to allege that the Application has been filed

prematurely. Therefore, I see no merit in that objection as well.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 74

7.4 Did the 1st Respondent - CEB encounter technical reasons (technical difficulties)

which justified the CEB refusing to grant the Letter of Intent?

The 4th Respondent has on behalf of the 1st Respondent CEB, cited several purported

technical reasons as to why the 1st Respondent CEB was unable to grant the Letter of

Intent to the Petitioner. I have referred to those technical reasons in detail earlier in this

judgment. Those reasons may be summarized as follows:

(i) problems arising due to constraints in the interconnection of electricity

generated by renewable energy power plants to the transmission system

(grid);

(ii) the need to refrain from granting the Letter of Intent pending the study of

grid connection limitations and effects on the system;

(iii) according to a study conducted, only 10 MW projects were viable for

Vavuniya.

Though the 4th Respondent has on behalf of the 1st Respondent CEB chosen to raise

these technical issues as one justification for the non-issue of the Letter of Intent to the

Petitioner, the evidence placed before this Court reveals the following:

(a) the first two out of the three technical reasons were of generic character possibly

applicable to all on-grid renewable energy-based electricity generation projects.

As at April 2012 when the Application of the Petitioner was being tendered to

the SLSEA, the CEB had not made a public announcement of such difficulties.

Thus, the Petitioner had no basis to entertain a well-founded belief that the

application for a permit under section 18 of the SLSEA Act will not be

entertained positively due to such technical reasons. If in fact there were such

technical reasons which necessitated the CEB not to grant grid interconnection

concurrence and Letter of Intent to project proponents, it was incumbent on the

CEB to have made an announcement to that effect;

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 75

(b) in this regard, the following paragraph in the Guidelines (P2C) is of great

relevance.

As the single buyer of electricity produced by the NRE project, CEB Transmission and

Bulk Supply Licensee will have to be satisfied with its ability to accept electricity

produced by the proposed project. This will be based on careful evaluation of system wide

impacts, network typology and system stability, in addition to the more commonly

understood constraints such as local transmission grid limitations and grid substation

capacity limitations. SEA will consult CEB in this regard upon receiving a complete

application, before presenting it to the PAC for Provisional Approval. Hence the absence

of the concurrence of CEB to grid connect the proposed project will result in refusal of

provisional approval. (Section 2.3, Concurrence of the CEB, page 8 of P2C)

On 18th May 2012 (P3B) the 5th Respondent acting on behalf of the 2nd

Respondent SLSEA wrote to the 4th Respondent General Manager of the CEB,

providing information pertaining to 23 Applications received by the SLSEA,

which included the Application submitted by the Petitioner. He sought

information from the CEB regarding the availability of grid capacity pertaining

to the proposed projects. He also sought the concurrence of the CEB to table the

corresponding Applications before the PAC for the grant of provisional

approval. It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner that this letter amounted to the 2nd Respondent SLSEA seeking grid

interconnection concurrence for the Petitioners proposed project from the 1st

Respondent. Learned Solicitor General for the Respondents did not express

disagreement with that contention. In response to P3B, the 1st Respondent

required the Petitioner to change the design of the proposed project to include a

battery storage system due to short-term power variation in electricity

generated by the proposed project. This shows that at this stage itself, the 1st

Respondent CEB had addressed its mind to technical aspects pertaining to the

project proposed by the Petitioner. Furthermore, the Petitioner changed the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 76

design of the proposed project to include a battery storage system. The

Petitioner has adverted to the fact that this would ensure smooth power output

at the grid end so that sudden power drops could be avoided. The Respondents

have not countered this position. The amenability of the Petitioner to change the

technical design of the proposed solar energy electricity generation plant to suit

the requirement of the CEB was conveyed by the Petitioner to the 2nd Respondent

SLSEA, and the SLSEA informed the CEB in 2012 itself. From 2012 till 2016, the

1st Respondent CEB remained silent. By P4A by letter dated 15th February

2016, the SLSEA wrote to the CEB specifically requesting from the latter, grid

interconnection approval for the Petitioners project. Finally, by letter dated 9th

May 2016 (P4B, which has also been produced marked P6J), the CEB wrote

to the SLSEA indicating that it had no objection to the SLSEA considering the

Petitioners Application for the grant of provisional approval. Counsel agreed

that this letter (P4B) amounted to the CEB granting grid interconnection

concurrence to the Petitioners project. Therefore, it concludes that certainly by

May 2016, the 1st Respondent CEB had cleared all possible technical concerns it

may have entertained as regards the Petitioners project.

It was in this backdrop that in May 2016, the PAC decided to grant provisional

approval to the project proposed by the Petitioner (a 10 megawatts Solar PV

Project with a battery storage system). Learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner submitted that a decision to grant provisional approval would have

been taken upon a careful evaluation of technical factors such as the systemwide

impacts, network typology, system typology, system stability, local transmission

grid limitations and limitations in capacity at the grid end sub-station. Learned

Solicitor General did not counter this submission. It is noteworthy that the

General Manager of the CEB was a constituent member of the PAC, and hence if

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 77

there were genuine technical reasons, he could have raised those reasons at the

PAC and objected to the grant of provisional approval.

Neither the 4th Respondent nor the learned Solicitor General explained to this

Court reasons for that technical turn-around. Nor was this Court informed as to

why even in November 2016, the CEB continued to indicate to the Petitioner of

the possibility of proceeding with the project, if certain technical modifications

were given effect to. If the two technical reasons cited by the 4th Respondent

genuinely prevented to 1st Respondent CEB from issuing the Letter of Intent

to the Petitioner, it could have raised such technical difficulties with the SLSEA

and with the Petitioner well before such factors were raised in the pleadings filed

in this Court.

Thus, the position taken up in the affidavit of the 4th Respondent is totally

unacceptable.

(c) Letters issued by the 1st Respondent CEB with regard to the Application

submitted by the Petitioner for a permit, namely P3D dated 21st November

2012, P6J dated 9th May 2016, P10B dated 1st December 2016, and P16

dated 22nd March 2017 make no reference to any of the purported technical

difficulties cited by the 4th Respondent. The 4th Respondent has not taken up the

position that Petitioner was not informed of the afore-stated purported technical

difficulties, as reasons for the non-issue of the Letter of Intent.

(d) Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the grant of the

provisional approval by the 2nd Respondent - SLSEA was a clear indication of

the issue of grid interconnection concurrence by the 1st Respondent CEB. That

such concurrence being issued is a clear indication that no technical difficulty

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 78

exists with regard to the proposed project of the Petitioner. Learned Solicitor

General for the Respondents did not counter this position.

(e) In terms of the findings of the study commissioned by the 1st Respondent CEB

(4R1), only 10 MW solar had been considered viable for Vavuniya. As stated

above, the project proposed by the Petitioner was a renewable energy project

which had the potential of generating 10 megawatts. Thus, the generation

capacity of the proposed project of the Petitioner matched this requirement

contained in the findings of the study. The affidavit of the 4th Respondent does

not contain any reason why under the afore-stated circumstances the project

proposed by the 4th Respondent was technically unsuitable.

In view of the foregoing circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that the technical

reasons cited by the 4th Respondent were in fact not the actual reason for the refusal on

the part of the 1st Respondent CEB to issue the Letter of Intent to the Petitioner. The

conduct of the CEB in granting grid interconnection concurrence in May 2016 clearly

shows that by that time the CEB had cleared whatever technical issues there may have

been and the proposed project of the Petitioner was of such nature that electricity

generated by it could be supplied to the national grid without encountering any

technical glitch. Thus, the said purported technical reasons cannot be accepted as valid

grounds to refuse granting any relief to the Petitioner.

7.5 Do the provisions of section 43 of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act as amended by Act

No. 31 of 2013 impose a legal compulsion on the CEB to call for tenders prior to

issuing a Letter of Intent to a solar powered electricity generation project which

would generate up to 10 megawatts of electricity?

Paragraph 23(c) of the affidavit of the 4th Respondent Aruna Kumara Samarasinghe,

the General Manager of the CEB reads as follows:

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 79

Following the amendment to the Electricity Act (Act No. 31 of 2013) procurement of electricity

has to be done on a competitive basis. This process of utilizing competitive bidding encourages

lower electricity cost, ultimately helping customer and national economy. [Emphasis added.]

Thus, the position of the 1st Respondent CEB is that following the amendment

introduced to the SLE Act by Act No. 31 of 2013, it became imperative for the CEB as a

transmission licensee (the sole transmission licensee) to procure electricity from a

person entitled to generate electricity and supply it to the national grid, based on the

selection of such person on a competitive basis.

The learned Solicitor General submitted that the enactment of Act No. 31 of 2013 was a

supervening event which prevented the 1st Respondent CEB from issuing a Letter of

Intent to the Petitioner. Referring to an opinion expressed by the 7th Respondent -

Honourable Attorney General (AG) to the 6th Respondent Secretary to the Ministry of

Power and Energy (4R1), the learned Solicitor General submitted that the AG had

expressed the view that where new electricity generation plants are required, the

amended law stipulates that the selection of licensees to operate new electricity

generation plants or for the expansion of existing generation plants and the price at

which electricity is to be purchased from such electricity generation plants is to be

determined by the selection of suitable persons based on competitive tenders to be

submitted by them.

In view of the position taken up on behalf of the 1st Respondent CEB in this regard, it

is necessary to examine the law, prior to the enactment of Act No. 31 of 2013, and the

changes introduced by the afore-stated amendment.

Section 43 (original section, prior to it being amended by Act No. 31 of 2013) of the SLE

Act, No. 20 of 2009 provided as follows:

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 80

43

(1) Subject to section 8, no person shall operate or provide any new generation plant or

extend any existing generation plant, except as authorized by the Commission under this

section.

(2) Subject to the approval of the Commission, a transmission licensee shall, in accordance

with the conditions of the transmission license and such guidelines relating to

procurement as may be prescribed by regulation and by notice published in the Gazette,

call for tenders to provide new generation plant or to extend existing generation plant,

as specified in the notice.

(3) A transmission licensee shall with the consent of the Commission, select a person to

provide at least cost, the new generation plant or to extend the existing generation

plant specified in the notice published under subsection (2), from amongst the persons

who have submitted technically acceptable tenders in response to such notice.

(Emphasis added).

[Section 8 provides as to who would be entitled to participate in a bidding process for

the generation of electricity. Section 9 elaborates that position with regard to those who

shall be eligible to apply for issue of a generation license with a generation capacity of

25 megawatts or more.]

Section 43 of the SLE Act (the original section) or any other provision of that Act (prior

to the amendment introduced by Act No. 31 of 2013) does not exclude the applicability

of section 43 to electricity generation plants which use renewable energy sources.

Neither party presented evidence which shows that the PUCSL had exempted

electricity generation projects which use renewable energy from provisions of the SLE

Act. Nor did learned Counsel who appeared for the Petitioner and the Respondent took

up the position that section 43 (in its original form) did not apply to electricity

generation plants which use renewable energy. Nor do the provisions of the SLSEA Act

exclude the application of the SLE Act to electricity generation plants which use

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 81

renewable energy. Therefore, the inference to be drawn is that the provisions of the SLE

Act (prior to the amendment) applied equally to electricity generation plants which use

both renewable energy and non-renewable energy.

It would thus be seen that well before the enactment of Act No. 31 of 2013 (which

amended provisions of the SLE Act, No. 20 of 2009 including section 43 thereof), the

original law itself provided for a competitive bidding process to be followed to select

project proponents of new electricity generation plants or to extend existing generation

plants (generation licenses), enabling the transmission licensee to purchase electricity at

the least cost from selected generation licensees. Thus, it would be incorrect to refer to

the methodology of competitive bidding through the calling of tenders as a

supervening event introduced to the law by Act No. 31 of 2013, as the original law

itself provided for that methodology.

Neither the 1st or the 2nd Respondents refer as to why the competitive bidding

methodology through the calling of tenders (which obviously is aimed at the CEB sole

transmission licensee purchasing electricity from electricity generation licensees at the

least cost) was not embedded in the Guide to the project approval process for on-grid

renewable energy projects development (P2C) issued by the 2nd Respondent SLSEA and

why such a procedure was not embedded in the procedure to be followed by project

proponents who were interested in obtaining a permit under section 18 of the SLSEA

Act to operate on-grid renewable energy based electricity generation projects.

From the evidence placed before this Court by the Petitioner and the 4th and 5th

Respondents on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, respectively, the only inference

this Court can arrive at, is that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have erroneously proceeded

on the footing that section 43 of the SLE Act (prior to being amended in 2013) had no

application to on-grid electricity generation plants which would utilize renewable

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 82

energy sources. As I propose to explain shortly, it appears that the 1st and 2nd

Respondents have proceeded with the same mindset till this Application was filed by

the Petitioner, notwithstanding the Honourable Attorney General in November 2013

(4R1 Attachment - 2) (which opinion had been issued after Act No. 31 of 2013 came

into operation) having expressed his opinion that the Sri Lanka Electricity (Amendment)

Act No. 31 of 2013 while repealing section 43 of the Principle Enactment, by section 43(4) of the

Amending Act, maintains the general principle that the purchase of electricity by the

Transmission licensee from new generation plants (and extensions thereto) shall be determined

by way of open competitive bidding, by way of tender [Emphasis added]. It would be seen

that by the use of the terminology maintains the general principle the Attorney

General has also noted that even prior to the amendment of section 43 by Act No. 31 of

2013, the principle of open competitive bidding by way of tender had been in

existence.

I will now deal with the position advanced on behalf of the Petitioner, that following

the amendment to the law introduced by Act No. 31 of 2013, section 43(4) read with

section 43(2) does not require the 1st Respondent CEB to call for tenders and cause

competitive bidding for the purpose of purchasing electricity from those to whom an

electricity generation license would be issued by the PUCSL and who would generate

electricity not exceeding 10 megawatts utilizing renewable energy sources such as solar

power. I propose to also deal with the other submission made on behalf of the Petitioner

that there was no need for the 1st Respondent CEB to negotiate the price at which

electricity was to be purchased from the Petitioner, as there was a Standardised Power

Purchase Agreement (SPPA) and a Small Power Purchase Tariff (SPPT) which had been

approved by the PUCSL and which specified the price at which electricity should be

purchased by the 1st Respondent CEB.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 83

In this regard, it would be necessary to consider the provisions of section 43 of the SLE

Act, as amended by Act No. 31 of 2013. For ease of reference, the relevant provisions of

section 43 are reproduced below:

(1) Subject to the provisions of section 8 of this Act, no person shall proceed with the

procuring or operating of any new generation plant or the expansion of the generation

capacity of an existing plant, otherwise than in the manner authorized by the commission

under this section.

(2) A transmission licensee shall, based on the future demand forecast as specified in the

Lease Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan prepared by such licensee and as amended

after considering the submissions of the distribution and generation licensees and approved

by the Commission, submit proposals to proceed with the procuring of any new generation

plant or for the expansion of the generation capacity of an existing plant, to the Commission

for its written approval:

Provided however where on the day preceding the date of the coming into force of this Act:-

(a) an approval of the Cabinet of Ministers had been obtained to develop a new

generation plant or to expand the generation capacity of an existing generation plant

; or

(b) a permit had been issued to generate electricity through renewable energy resources

by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority established by the Sri Lanka

Sustainable Energy Authority Act, No. 35 of 2007 under section 18 of that Act, as a

consequence of which the development of a new generation plant or the expansion of

the generation capacity of an existing plant, has become necessary,

the approval obtained or the permit issued, as the case may be, shall be referred to the

Commission for its approval. The Commission shall, having considered the request made

along with any supporting documents annexed thereto and on being satisfied that the

necessary Cabinet approval has been obtained or a permit had been issued by the Sustainable

Energy Authority, as the case may be, prior to the coming into force of this Act, grant

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 84

approval to the transmission licensee to proceed with the procuring of the new generation

plant or the expansion of the generation capacity of its existing plant, as the case may be.

(3) Where a person who is issued with a licence under section 13 of this Act to generate

electricity of less than 25MW in capacity, proposes to expand its generation capacity of

its generation plant as a consequence of which the generation of electricity would exceed

25MW in capacity, the approval of the Commission under subsection (1) for such

proposal shall not be granted, unless such person is a person who is qualified under

subsection (1) of section 9 of this Act, to be issued with a generation licence.

(4) Upon obtaining the approval of the Commission under subsection (2), the transmission

licensee shall in accordance with the conditions of its transmission licencee shall in

accordance with the conditions of its transmission licence and in compliance with any

rules that may be made by the Commission relating to procurement, call for tenders by

notice published in the Gazette, to develop a new generation plant or to expand the

generation capacity of an existing generation plant, as the case may be, as shall be

specified in the notice:

Provided however, subject to the provisions of subsection (6) of this section, the

requirement to submit a tender on the publication of a notice under this subsection shall

not be applicable in respect of any new generation plant or to the expansion of any

existing generation plant that is being developed

(a) in accordance with the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan duly

approved by the Commission and which has received the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers on the date preceding the date of the coming into force of this Act and is

required to be operated at least cost;

(b) on a permit issued by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority, established by the

Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act No. 35 of 2007 under section 18 of that

Act for the generation of electricity through renewable energy sources and required to

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 85

be operated at the standardized tariff and is governed by a Standardized Power

Purchase Agreement approved by the Cabinet of Ministers; or

(c) in compliance with the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan duly

approved by the Commission having received the prior approval of the Commission,

for which the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been received on the basis of : -

(i) an offer received from a foreign sovereign Government to the Government of Sri

Lanka, for which the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers have been obtained ; or

(ii) to meet any emergency situation as determined by the Cabinet of Ministers

during a national calamity or a long term forced outage of a major generation plant,

where protracted bid inviting process outweigh the potential benefit or procuring

emergency capacity required to be provided by any person at least cost.

(5) Upon the close of the tender, the transmission licensee shall through a properly

constituted tender board, recommend to the Commission for its approval, the person who

is best capable of

(a) Developing the new generation plant or the expansion of the generation capacity of

an existing generation plant, as the case may be, as specified in the notice published

in the Gazette under subsection (4), in compliance with the technical and economic

parameters of the transmission licensee:

(b) Selling electrical energy or electricity generating capacity at least cost; and

(c) Meeting the requirements of the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan of

the transmission licensee duly approved by the Commission,

along with the draft Power Purchase Agreement, describing the terms and conditions of

such purchase.

(6) Notwithstanding the fact that: -

(a) An exemption from the submission of a tender is granted to any person under

paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of the proviso to subsection (4); or

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 86

(b) A new generation plant or an expansion of the generating capacity of an existing

generation plant is being developed in accordance with the Least Cost Long Term

Generation Expansion Plan duly approved by the Commission, by a person who had

obtained the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers and which approval is in force on

the date of the coming into operation of this Act,

the transmission licensee shall be required to negotiate with the person concerned to

satisfy itself, that such person is capable of developing the new generation plant or the

expansion of the generating capacity of an existing generation plant, as the case may be,

in compliance with the technical and economical parameters of the transmission licensee

and is capable of selling electrical energy or electricity generating capacity at least cost,

and forward its recommendations for approval to the Commission, along with the draft

Power Purchase Agreement or the draft Standardized Power Purchase Agreement, as the

case may be, describing the terms and conditions of such purchase.

(7) The Commission shall be required on receipt of any recommendations of the transmission

licensee under subsection (5) or subsection (6), as the case may be, to grant its approval

at its earliest convenience, where the Commission is satisfied that the recommended price

for the purchase of electrical energy or electricity generating capacity meets the principle

of least cost and the requirements of the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion

Plan and that the terms and conditions of such purchase is within the accepted technical

and economical parameters of the transmission licensee.

(8) For the purpose of this section

Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan means a plan prepared by the

transmission licensee and amended and approved by the Commission on the basis of the

submissions made by the licensees and published by the Commission, indicating the

future electricity generation capacity requirements determined on the basis of least

economic cost and meeting the technical and reliability requirements of the electricity

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 87

network of Sri Lanka which is duly approved by the Commission and published in the

Gazette from time to time; and

Standardized Power Purchase Agreement means an agreement entered into by the

transmission licensee for the purchase of electrical energy or electricity generation

capacity, generated using renewable energy resources under a permit issued by the Sri

Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority Act, No. 35 of 2007, under section 18 of that Act.

From a plain reading of the section, it is clear that section 43 of the SLE Act inter-alia

applies to (i) the procuring of a new electricity generating plant or the expansion of an

existing plant by the transmission licensee (the CEB), and (ii) the operation of a new

electricity generation plant or the expansion of an existing plant by a generation

licensee. It is also apparent that, section 43 applies to both electricity generation plants

using non-renewable energy sources as well as to those using renewable energy

sources. Section 43(2) provides that the process of procurement of electricity by the

transmission licensee (the CEB) shall commence with the latter preparing a Least Cost

Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan and getting it approved by the Commission.

Procurement of electricity by the transmission licensee from a generation licensee shall

be in accordance with such plan. Thus, it is evident that the procurement of electricity

shall be based on the national need for electricity and the requirement of the

transmission licensee to service that demand as provided in the Least Cost Long Term

Generation Expansion Plan. Further, this plan should facilitate the purchase of

electricity by the transmission licensee at the least cost, enabling the transmission

licensee to provide electricity to consumers also at least cost. However, as stipulated in

the proviso to subsection 43(2), following the afore-stated methodology shall not be

necessary in the following two situations:

(i) instances where on the day preceding the date of coming into operation of the

Act, an approval had been obtained from the Cabinet of Ministers to develop

either a new electricity generation plant or to expand the generation capacity

of an existing plant;

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 88

(ii) instances where on a day preceding the date of coming into operation of the

Act, a permit had been issued by the SLSEA under section 18 of the SLSEA

Act to generate electricity through renewable energy resources.

As stated earlier, in terms of section 21 of Act No. 31 of 2013, the amendments made to

the principal enactment (SLE Act, No. 20 of 2009) by provisions of the amending Act

shall be deemed for all purposes to have come into force on 8th April 2009. Therefore,

the two exemptions stated above contained in the proviso to section 43(2) with regard to

the requirement to follow the legislative scheme contained in section 43(2) would not be

applicable, only if either the approval by the Cabinet of Ministers or a permit issued

under section 18 of the SLSEA Act had been obtained prior to 8th April 2009. In the

instant case, as at 8th April 2009, neither the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers nor a

permit under section 18 of the SLSEA Act had been obtained for the project proposed

by the Petitioner. Therefore, the proviso to subsection 43(2) would have no applicability

to the instant case. Thus, it was incumbent on the transmission licensee CEB to have

complied with the procedural requirement contained in subsection 43(2). Neither party

has placed before this Court any evidence in that regard. Nor has either party alleged

that the 1st Respondent CEB had failed to comply with subsection 43(2) of the SLE Act.

It would be seen that subsection 43(3) has no applicability to this case, as this instant

case does not relate to the expansion of the electricity generation capacity of an existing

plant.

In terms of section 43(4), after obtaining the approval from the PUCSL under section

43(2), the transmission licensee (CEB) is required to in accordance with the conditions of

the transmission licence call for tenders by notice published in the Gazette. However,

subject to the provisions of subsection (6), this requirement of calling for tenders shall

not be applicable in three instances. One such instance is if the new electricity

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 89

generation plant or the expansion of an existing plant is being developed on a permit

issued by the SLSEA established under section 18 of the SLSEA Act for the generation of

electricity through renewable energy sources and required to be operated at the

standardized tariff and is governed by a Standardised Power Purchase Agreement

approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. [paragraph (b) of the proviso to subsection 43(4)]

However, notwithstanding that exemption, under subsection 43(6)(a), the transmission

licensee is required to negotiate with the generation licensee for the purpose of

satisfying itself of the capability of such person to develop the new generation plant in

compliance with the technical and economical parameters of the transmission licensee

and regarding its capability to sell electricity at least cost.

As pointed out by learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner, section 6 of the

Guidelines (P2C) issued by the SLSEA is of significance. Section 6 contains 3 parts.

The first and third parts relate to projects which generate up to 10 megawatts of

electricity (as in the case of the project proposed by the Petitioner). The second part

relates to projects which generate electricity in excess of 10 megawatts, and thus is

irrelevant in so far as the Petitioners project is concerned. The first and third parts of

section 6 are reproduced below:

For projects up to 10 MW: SEA and CEB offer a Standardised Power Purchase

Agreement (SPPA) for renewable energy projects of the approved types, with an installed

capacity up to 10 MW. The SPPA is standardized and non-negotiable, and is valid for

twenty years from the commercial operation date. Projects eligible for the SPPA are also

eligible to be paid under the Small Power Purchase Tariff (SPPT).

Small Power Purchase Tariff: For renewable energy projects up to 10 MW, the

standardized tariffs would apply. The tariff for projects that would enter into an SPPA is

published at any given time, typically at the end of each calendar year. There will be a

tariff review process conducted by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka typically

once a year, where the following will be considered;

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 90

(a) Types of projects to be offered the standardized tariffs (whether any new types of

projects have matured to an adequate level to be included in the tariff schedule.

(b) Tariffs to be offered to Developers entering into an SPPA in the coming year.

Thus, it would be seen that the Guidelines envisage the CEB entering into an

Agreement with a person who generates electricity (mobilizing a renewable energy

source) not exceeding 10 megawatts. The Agreement will be founded upon a uniform

template which is referred to as the Standardised Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA).

The price at which electricity generated by the project will be purchased by the CEB will

be governed by the clauses of the Small Power Purchase Tariff (SPPT), which has

received the approval of the PUCSL.

Therefore, had the SLSEA issued a permit to the Petitioner under section 18 of the

SLSEA Act (following the CEB having issued a Letter of Intent to the Petitioner), the

situation of the Petitioner would have come under paragraph (b) of the proviso to

section 43(4) of the SLE Act (as amended). In the circumstances, it would not have been

necessary for the transmission licensee (the CEB) to have called for tenders for the

development of a new electricity generation plant and for the Petitioner to have

submitted a tender in response, prior to issuing a Letter of Intent to the Petitioner.

In view of the foregoing, I hold that, in the circumstances of this case, provisions of

section 43 of the SLE Act as amended by Act No. 31 of 2013 do not impose a legal

compulsion on the CEB to call for tenders prior to issuing a Letter of Intent to a solar

powered electricity generation project which would generate up to 10 megawatts of

electricity, if such person who proposes to commission a renewable energy-based

electricity generation plant has received a permit under section 18 of the SLSEA Act.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 91

Had the 1st Respondent CEB (transmission licensee) have issued to the Petitioner a

Letter of Intent signaling its intention to procure electricity from the Petitioner at the

Small Power Purchase Tariff after entering into a Standardised Power Purchase

Agreement, that would have enabled the 2nd Respondent SLSEA to issue a permit

under section 18 of the SLSEA Act to the Petitioner, which would have in turn enabled

the 1st Respondent to comply with subsections 43(6) and 43(7) of the SLE Act (as

amended).

7.6 Is the Petitioner entitled in fact and in law to entertain a legitimate expectation

that the CEB would have issued a Letter of Intent and the SLSEA would have

issued a permit to the Petitioner in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act, and have

such legitimate expectations been frustrated by the CEB and the SLSEA?

In this regard, the Petitioners claim for relief founded upon an alleged frustration of a

substantive legitimate expectation is said to have been generated by the 1st Respondent

CEB and the 2nd Respondent SLSEA. In order to establish that certain

representations were made by the two Respondents which were relied upon by the

Petitioner, he has based his case founded upon four sets of documents. They are

(i) A publication containing a set of guidelines issued by the 2nd Respondent -

SLSEA entitled A Guide to the Project Approval Process for On-grid Renewable

Energy Project Development (hereinafter referred to as the Guide) with the

sub-title Policies and procedures to secure approvals to develop a renewable energy

project to supply electricity to the national grid of July 2011 P2C

(ii) Regulations dated 22nd April 2009 made by the Minister under and in terms

of sections 67 read with sections 16(2), 17(2)(a) and section 18(2)(a) of the

SLSEA Act - P2Aand the amended Regulations dated 6th May 2011 P2B

(iii) Correspondence the Petitioner has had with the 1st and 2nd Respondents, with

special attention to letters received by the Petitioner from the 1st and 2nd

Respondents. P3C, P3E, P3F, P3G, P3H, P4A, P5A P5B,

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 92

P7A, P7B, P7C, P9, P10A, P11, P12, P13and P15. [Printed

in bold are letters received by the Petitioner.]

(iv) Correspondence between the 1st and 2nd Respondents pertaining to the

Application presented by the Petitioner seeking a permit under section 18 of

the SLSEA Act, to which the Petitioner has been privy to. P3B, P3D,

P4B/P6J, P10B, and P14.

An examination of the Guide (P2C) and its application to this matter reveal the

following:

(a) The Guide had been issued by the 2nd Respondent SLSEA in July 2011. There is no

evidence placed before this Court that the Guide was amended after its original

publication or that it was amended and re-published following the enactment of the

SLE (Amendment) Act No. 31 of 2013.

(b) The Guide is aimed at several distinct groups of persons, which include those

intending to develop and invest in projects for the generation of on-grid electricity

generation projects using renewable energy. The Petitioner belongs to that category

of persons to whom the guidelines issued by the 2nd Respondent SLSEA relate;

(c) The Guide is also aimed at serving as a reference to institutions that would be

reviewing Applications from investors seeking permits and approvals. The 1st

Respondent CEB is one such institution.

(d) The Guide is intended to provide a detailed explanation regarding the process to be

followed as prescribed in the On-grid Renewable Energy Projects Regulations 2009

(P2A). The Petitioner claims to have followed the procedure contained in the

Regulations (P2A and P2B) and the Guide (P2C).

(e) The Guide contains a set of detailed guidelines regarding the manner in which

Applications seeking a permit under and in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act

should be perfected, the method of submitting the Application to the SLSEA, and

the manner in which it will be processed. There is a detailed reference in the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 93

guidelines to the two-tiered process of initially processing the Application and

granting provisional approval, and upon conditions contained in the provisional

approval being satisfied by the applicant, the manner in which final approval and

the permit will be granted. The scheme contained in the Guide is compatible with

provisions of the SLSEA Act. Up to the stage where the 1st Respondent CEB

refrained from issuing a Letter of Intent to the Petitioner, the procedure followed

by the 2nd Respondent SLSEA had been in compliance with the step by step

approach contained in the Guide. Furthermore, up to that point of time when the 1st

Respondent CEB by implication refused to issue a Letter of Intent it (the CEB)

had also participated in this process in compliance with the provisions contained in

the Guide. In this regard, I have given my particular attention to the 1st Respondent

CEBs participation in the grant of grid interconnection concurrence and his

having participated in the grant of provisional approval to the Petitioner.

Furthermore, under the title Grant and Refusal of Provisional Approval is a

reference to the fact that all Applications received by the SLSEA will in consultation

with the CEB be evaluated to ascertain the possibility of securing grid connection.

Documentary evidence placed before this Court clearly reveals that the CEB did

even after the enactment of the SLE (Amendment) Act No. 31 of 2013 act in terms of

the Guide towards granting grid interconnection concurrence and provisional

approval to the Application of the Petitioner. Thus, I conclude that through

acquiescence, the 1st Respondent has also endorsed the Guide.

(f) Clause 2.2 of Appendix 4 of the Guide (at page 28) titled Letter of Intent states that

it will be issued by the CEB and signifies an assurance that the electricity generated

by the project will be procured by the CEB. It further states that an application to

the CEB to obtain a Letter of Intent could yield one of the following two standard

responses:

a. that the CEB is willing to purchase electricity from the project as per attached

grid connection proposal;

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 94

b. that the CEB is willing to purchase electricity from the project, but the grid

proposal will be provided within one month.

The Guide does not contain any reference to the project proponent having to engage

in a competitive bidding process for the purpose of obtaining the Letter of Intent

or the requirement to engage in any negotiation with the CEB pertaining to the

tariff at which the electricity generated by the project will be sold to the CEB,

provided however the output of electricity generated by the project does not exceed

10MW.

(g) As stated in a previous part of this judgment, under the title Power Purchase

Agreements and Tariffs (page 16) there is reference to the fact that for projects up

to 10 MW, the SLSEA and the CEB offer a Standardised Power Purchase

Agreement. This position is reiterated in clause 4.3 of Appendix 4 of the Guide (at

page 30). The provisions of the relevant Agreement are standardized and non-

negotiable and such projects are entitled to apply for the Small Power Purchase

Tariff. Once a year there will be a review process of the applicable tariffs conducted

by the PUCSL and published typically at the end of each calendar year. Thus, it is

manifestly clear that the Letter of Intent by the CEB to purchase electricity

generated by the project (referred to by the parties as well as in this judgment as a

Letter of Intent) will for projects aimed at generating up to 10MW and no more (as

in the case of the project of the Petitioner) be founded upon the standard power

purchase tariff stipulated from time to time by the PUCSL. This scheme is in

consonance with not only the status of the law prior to the enactment of the SLE

(Amendment) Act No. 31 of 2013, but with the statutory scheme contained therein

as well.

(h) Clause 4.1 of Appendix 4 of the Guide (at page 29) clearly states that following the

obtaining of a provisional approval by the project proponent and the satisfaction

of all the conditions contained therein (which is clearly a reference to obtaining

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 95

approvals from relevant external agencies and obtaining a Letter of Intent from the

CEB, the permit will be issued under and in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act

sequel to a decision to be taken by the PAC. [Once all other approvals are secured by a

project developer, the PAC grants a 20 years permit (extendable by a further 20 years after

successful operation of the project during the initial 20 year period) to the developer

allowing him to use the resource under several conditions.] Thus, it is clear that,

following the Petitioner having received the provisional approval from the 2nd

Respondent SLSEA, the only condition the petitioner was required to satisfy for

the purpose of obtaining a permit under and in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA

Act, was a Letter of Intent from the 1st Respondent CEB.

I have examined the Regulations promulgated by the Minister under the SLSEA Act

contained in P2A and P2B, and have found nothing therein contrary to the contents

of the Guidelines (P2C).

I have also considered the contents of the letters sent by the 1st Respondent CEB and

2nd Respondent (SLSEA) to the Petitioner and the correspondence between the 1st and

2nd Respondent pertaining to the Application of the Petitioner seeking a permit under

and in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act, to which the Petitioner had been privy. It

primarily reveals the following sequence of key events: By Application dated 20th April

2012 submitted by the Petitioner to the SLSEA (P3A), he sought a permit under

section 18 of the 2nd Respondent - SLSEA to commission an on-grid renewable energy

(solar) based electricity generation plant with an output not exceeding 10MW. The

Application was in accordance with the provisions of the SLSEA Act, Regulations and

the several clauses of the Guide, and was thus accepted by the 2nd Respondent. By letter

dated 18th May 2012 (P3B), the 2nd Respondent sought the concurrence of the 1st

Respondent CEB to place the afore-stated Application before the PAC. Prior to

granting its concurrence, the 1st Respondent CEB required the project proponent (the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 96

Petitioner) to alter the technical design of the proposed project, which requirement was

promptly accepted by the Petitioner (P3C dated 19th November 2012, P3E dated

24th November 2015 and P3G dated 1st December 2015). By letter dated 15th February

2016 (P4A), the 2nd Respondent SLSEA once again sought from the 1st Respondent

CEB grid interconnection concurrence to the Petitioners project (P4A). Finally, by

letter dated 9th May 2016 (P4B), the 1st Respondent CEB granted its concurrence to

the 1st Respondent SLSEA to place the Petitioners Application before the PAC of the

SLSEA. By letter dated 19th May 2016 (P5A), the PAC of the SLSEA (which comprised

of inter-alia the Director General of the PUCSL and the Deputy General Manager

(Energy Purchase) of the 1st Respondent CEB) granted provisional approval to the

on-grid renewable energy-based electricity generation project proposed by the

Petitioner.

Upon a careful consideration of the four categories of material referred to above [(i) to

(iv)] and the applicable law, I have arrived at the following conclusions:

1. The Guide (P2C) prepared and published by the 2nd Respondent SLSEA

contains lawful and intra-vires representations of the SLSEA pertaining to inter-

alia on-grid renewable energy-based electricity generation projects aimed at

generating not more than 10 MW of electricity. The Guide contains unambiguous

and specific content amounting to representations aimed at a specific group of

persons, i.e. project proponents who propose to obtain a permit under and in

terms section 18 of the SLSEA Act for the purpose of commissioning an on-grid

renewable energy-based electricity generation project with an electricity output

not exceeding 10MW. The 1st Respondent has by acquiescence with provisions of

the Guide exhibited its willingness to abide by the provisions of the Guide

pertaining to the CEB, and by its letters sent to the Petitioner (referred to above)

impliedly represented to the Petitioner that following the Petitioner complying

with the provisions of the Guide (P2C), it will issue a Letter of Intent to the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 97

Petitioner company enabling it to obtain a permit under and in terms of section

18 of the SLSEA Act.

2. The 2nd Respondent SLSEA has by the several correspondence sent to the

Petitioner and letters exchanged with the 1st Respondent CEB relating to the

Petitioners Application (to which the Petitioner was privy) has inter-alia

generated an expectation in the mind of the Petitioner that upon the Petitioner

satisfying the conditions contained in the provisional approval issued by the

SLSEA to the Petitioner (of which the only outstanding one is the Letter of

Intent to have been issued by the CEB), a permit will be issued to the Petitioner

under and in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act.

3. The 1st Respondent CEB has through its acquiescence with the provisions of the

Guide (P2C), correspondence it had with the Petitioner and correspondence

with the SLSEA pertaining to the Petitioners Application (which the Petitioner

was privy to) made implied representations to the Petitioner and thereby

generated an expectation that following the Petitioner having obtained

provisional approval from the SLSEA (which was following the re-design of the

project to suit the technical requirements of the 1st Respondent CEB), it will

grant a Letter of Intent to the Petitioner, enabling the Petitioner to obtain a

permit under and in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act.

4. In view of provisions of the contents of the Guide (P2C) and the

correspondence the 1st Respondent CEB had with the Petitioner (even up to

letter dated 1st December 2016 (P10B) wherein the Petitioner was asked to

revert to the original technical design of the project (to which the Petitioner

promptly agreed), it is evident that at no previous time did the 1st Respondent

CEB make any representation to the Petitioner that the Petitioner had to engage

in a competitive bidding process (by submitting a tender) for the purpose of

obtaining a Letter of Intent from the CEB. Through implication, the 1st

Respondent CEB also intimated to the Petitioner that if he were to comply with

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 98

the several applicable clauses of the Guide (P2C), he will be entitled to obtain a

Letter of Intent from the 1st Respondent CEB.

As explained by me in Part 7.5 of this judgment, for an on-grid electricity generation

project using renewable energy with an electricity output not exceeding 10MW, it is not

necessary for the CEB to call for tenders and for project proponents to submit tenders or

to negotiate and agree on the price at which electricity generated by the project is to be

sold to the CEB. Therefore, the reason cited by the 1st Respondent CEB for having

refused to issue a Letter of Intent to the Petitioner is not justiciable, as the position

taken up by the 1st Respondent CEB is not in accordance with the law. Thus, the

expectation entertained by the Petitioner to follow the path contained in the Guide

(P2C) and obtain a provisional approval, Letter of Intent and a permit under and

in terms of section 18 in that sequence, is legitimate, as it is in accordance with the law.

Due to the foregoing reasons, I hold that the expectation entertained by the Petitioner

that it will be issued with a Letter of Intent by the 1st Respondent CEB and thereafter

a permit under and in terms of section 18 of the SLSEA Act by the SLSEA are

expectations the Petitioner was entitled in law and through the representations and

conduct of the 1st and 2nd Respondents to entertain. By their very nature, the said

expectations are not mere procedural expectations, but substantive expectations. The

evidence placed before this Court clearly reveals that the afore-stated legitimate

expectations of the Petitioner have been frustrated by the 1st Respondent CEB initially

by its inordinate delay and thereafter its refusal to issue the Letter of Intent, and by the

2nd Respondent SLSEA by its inability to obtain the Letter of Intent for the Petitioner

on behalf of the Petitioner and by the non-issuance of the permit. In the circumstances

of this case, the substantive legitimate expectations of the Petitioner should in my view

be protected through relief granted by this Court.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 99

7.7 Is the Petitioner entitled to any relief and if so, what reliefs should the Petitioner be

entitled to?

Where a substantive legitimate expectation of a claimant has been frustrated by a

decision-maker for a reason that is not in wider public interest justiciable, and the

impugned decision is either perverse or irrational, the Court will and should not

refrain from intervening in granting substantive protection to the claimant. Relief of

substantive character should be granted in instances where the impugned decision

has been taken contrary to expectations the public authority has generated and is

therefore unlawful, and thus amounts to an abuse of power. It would also be

available in instances where the change in policy, applicable criteria and procedure

is not objectively and rationally aimed at serving wider public interests and is not

proportionate to the intended goal of serving public interests.

Substantive relief will be granted by court for the purpose of protecting the

substantive legitimate expectation of the claimant, as it is necessary to do so not only

because doing so is in the interest of the claimant, but in public interests as well. As

held by Justice Amerasinghe in Dayarathna and Others v. Minister of Indigenous

Medicine and Others (referred to above), when taking a decision on whether or not

substantive relief as opposed to procedural relief should be granted, the court

should weigh genuine public interest against private interests, and decide on the

legitimacy of the expectation of the claimant, having regard to the weight it carries

in the face of the need for a change of policy which may also be in public interest.

It is in this regard necessary for me to observe that the belated position taken up by the

1st Respondent CEB is contrary to law. The Respondents have not shown this Court

any basis to conclude that the non-grant of either the Letter of Intent or the permit to

the Petitioner is in the wider interests of the public. In what is undoubtedly in public

interest was for the 1st and 2nd Respondents to have expeditiously processed the

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 100

Application of the Petitioner and grant the permit sought by the Petitioner. Both

Respondents have unlawfully and miserably failed in the performance of their duty

towards the public in encouraging project proponents to harvest green energy sources

such as solar energy for the purpose of generating electricity which would be

environmentally friendly. This case is a case study in itself exemplifying how two State

agencies have floundered in the performance of their public duties.

The repercussions of the 1st Respondent - CEB and the 2nd Respondent - SLSEA in not

having encouraged and facilitated entrepreneurs to, through private enterprise,

generate electricity by tapping renewable energy sources and feed such electricity to the

national grid, was only too evident in the year 2022, when the country and her people

had to suffer severely due to the insufficiency of electricity generation and the over-

dependency on petroleum as a means of generating electricity. This situation resulted in

power outages of long duration, which affected the daily lives of the public at large and

resulted in serious consequences to trade, industry and commerce. At the time of

writing this judgment, the critical importance of generating electrical energy using

sustainable and renewable energy resources available in abundance in Sri Lanka, and

the devastating consequences that have arisen out of the failure on the part of agencies

of the State to voluminously and efficiently mobilize new renewable energy generation

projects for the generation of electricity using solar and wind power, and other

renewable energy resources is felt unlike ever before. The incident referred to in this

judgment is an unfortunate testament to the root causes of the prevailing situation to

which I find the 1st and 2nd Respondents having to bear responsibility.

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 101

8. Orders of Court

For the reasons enumerated above, I hold that the Petitioner is entitled to the following

reliefs:

(i) Due to the reasons set out in this judgment, I hold that in processing the

Application submitted by the Petitioner for a permit under section 18 of the

SLSEA Act, the 1st and 2nd Respondents have not acted in terms of the law. I

note that the culpability of the 1st Respondent CEB far exceeds the

culpability of the 2nd Respondent - SLSEA. In the circumstances, I declare that

the 1st and 2nd Respondents acting jointly have infringed the fundamental

right of the Petitioner to the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article

12(1) of the Constitution.

(ii) In view of the detailed analysis of the facts and the law contained in this

judgment, it would not be necessary for me to delve in detail into the

consequences arising out of the conduct of the 1st and 2nd Respondents to the

fundamental right of the Petitioner to engage inter-alia in the lawful business

which he had chosen, planned and applied for, namely the generation of solar

powered electricity, providing such electricity to the national grid, and

thereby generating income which would include profit. In the circumstances,

I hold that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have jointly infringed the fundamental

right of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution,

which infringement had financial implications to the Petitioner.

(iii) The 1st Respondent CEB shall forthwith issue a Letter of Intent to the

Petitioner in accordance with the law and the provisions of the Guide

(P2C).

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 102

(iv) Upon the Petitioner submitting to the 2nd Respondent SLSEA proof of the

satisfaction of the conditions contained in the provisional approval

including the afore-stated Letter of Intent, the 2nd Respondent shall within

one month of the submission of such material, process the Application of the

Petitioner in accordance with the law and the relevant provisions of the

Guide (P2C), and issue a permit to the Petitioner under and in terms of

section 18 of the SLSEA Act.

(v) I am acutely conscious that this infringement would have resulted in

considerable financial loss to the Petitioner, which this Court is regrettably

though, compelled not to fully compensate. Providing reparation for loss of

profit suffered by the Petitioner arising out of the infringement of

fundamental rights would be quite justified in the circumstances of this case.

However, I am sensitive to the fact that making such an order for full

reparation will only result in the Consolidated Fund having to bear such

burden, which would eventually result in the tax paying public having to

suffer further hardships.

However, the attendant circumstances of this case require this Court to make

an order for the payment of a significant amount of damages. Such an order

should have a deterrent effect on not only the 1st and the 2nd Respondents, the

state as well. Therefore, I direct that the 1st Respondent who has been

primarily responsible for the infringement of the fundamental rights of the

Petitioner, shall pay the Petitioner a sum of Rs. 1,000,000.00 as damages.

(vi) Since the 1st Respondent through its officials has been primarily responsible

for the infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner, it would be

the responsibility of the state to identify such individual officials of the 1st

Respondent CEB, and take appropriate action against them. This is a matter

SC/FR/172/2017 - JUDGMENT (20TH SEPTEMBER, 2023) 103

in respect of which I would have ordinarily ordered the payment of punitive

damages by the individual officers who had been instrumental in the

infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by

Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution, provided their identities

transpired through the evidence placed before Court.

Accordingly, the Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy is hereby

directed to cause the conduct of an investigation into this matter and take

action according to law against those identified for having infringed the

fundamental rights of the Petitioner. The findings and the action taken should

be reported to this Court.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to forward copies of this Judgement to the

Honourable Attorney General and to the Secretary to the Ministry of Power and

Energy.
