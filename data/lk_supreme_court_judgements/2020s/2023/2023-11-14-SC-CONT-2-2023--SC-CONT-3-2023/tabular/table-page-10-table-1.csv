"The  Privy  Council  in  Reginald  Perera  v  The  King  52  NLR  293  at  296  in  reference  to  the"
"definition of contempt of court, it was observed:"
"“...That phrase has not lacked authoritative interpretation. There must be involved some"
"act  done  or  writing  published  calculated  to  bring  a  Court  or  a  judge  of  the  Court  into"
"contempt  or  to  lower  his  authority  ""  or  something  ""  calculated  to  obstruct  or  interfere"
"with the due course of justice or the lawful process of the Courts """
"The Court of Appeal in Croos and Another v Dabrera [1999] 1 SLR 205 at 209-210, observed"
"that:"
"“The charge of contempt of court, was classically defined in the case of Regina v. Kopito,"
"by Goodman, J. as ""the scandalizing of the court, in that the words or the acts are likely"
"to bring the court and Judges into disrepute."
"The  action  taken  with  regard  to  acts  of  contempt  is  based  on  the  premises  that  a  well-"
"regulated  laws  of  a  civilized  community  cannot  be  sustained  without  sanctions  being"
"imposed for such conduct. It is therefore thought important to maintain the respect and"
"dignity  of  the  court  and  its  officers,  whose  task  it  is  to  uphold  and  enforce  the  law,"
"because  without  such  respect,  public  faith  in  the  Administration  of  Justice  would  be"
"undermined and the law itself would fall into disrepute.”"
"The  Court  further  observed  that  “Even  if  contempt  is  not  always  a  crime,  it  bears  a  criminal"
"character and therefore, it must be satisfactorily proved. Lord Denning, M. R in Re Bramblewale"
"([1969] 3 ALL ER 1012) stated that ""a contempt of court must be satisfactorily proven. To use"
"the all time honoured phrase it must be proven beyond reasonable doubt” (supra at 210)"
