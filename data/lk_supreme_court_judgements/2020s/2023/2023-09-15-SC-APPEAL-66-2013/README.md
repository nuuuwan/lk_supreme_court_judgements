The Petitioner-Appellant filed a petition before the Court of Appeal praying inter alia, a Writ

of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Maharagama Urban Council contained in item No. 10

of the Local Government Notice published in Gazette No. 1461/ 2006 dated 01-09-2006. The

said Notice published in the afore-stated Gazette was to vest a by-lane in the Maharagama

Urban Council (1st Respondent-Respondent) in terms of Sections 50 and 52 of the Urban

Councils Ordinance. The said by lane has been depicted in the sketch produced marked P

5(c) which was annexed to the petition filed in the Court of Appeal. As per the said sketch,

the said by-lane commences from the property bearing the Assessment No. 48 in

Jambugasmulla Mawatha in Nugegoda and runs up to the property bearing the Assessment

No. 50. The properties bearing the Assessment Nos. 48/1, 48/2 and 48/3 are on one side of

that by-lane and the properties bearing the Assessment Nos. 52, 52/1 50/1 and 50 are on the

other side of the by-lane.

[SC Appeal 66/2013] Page 3 of 10

At the outset, I must state that the Petition dated 16-10-2007 filed by the Petitioner in the

Court of Appeal which had sought the above Writ, has not set out any legal basis upon which

the Court of Appeal could have acted in order to consider issuing the writ prayed for by the

Petitioner-Appellant.

When filing a writ application any petitioner is obliged to state in its petition the legal basis

upon which he/she seeks the writs prayed for in its petition. This is necessary because the

court is required to consider such application by applying the relevant law applicable to the

legal basis stated in such application. For example, some of such bases which could be cited

in such petitions are illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety etc. whatever such basis

would be, it must be clearly discernible from the petition filed by such petitioner in Court. This

is because Article 140 of the Constitution has only empowered the Court of Appeal to grant

and issue, according to law, orders in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against any public authority. The law applicable to

one ground differs from another and that is why the compliance of the requirement to clearly

state the legal basis in a petition is necessary.

There is another important reason as to why this should be so. The public authorities who

have been made respondents to such writ applications are required to defend themselves

against the allegations that may have been levelled against them. They generally conduct

their defences with the help of legal assistance from lawyers. Thus, it is of paramount

importance not only for any such respondent in such writ application, but also for his/ her

lawyers who would appear for such respondent, to know exactly the legal basis upon which a

writ has been sought from court against such respondent under Article 140 of the Constitution.

Any petition which does not comply with the afore-said requirement at least remotely, would

therefore be a petition which is misconceived in law.

A closer look at the Petition filed by the Petitioner-Appellant, shows that the several averments

in the Petition only contain the sequence of events of certain incidents. They merely have set

out the factual background of a dispute to the relevant by-lane that had existed between the

Petitioner-Appellant and certain other parties who are residents of some of the afore-

mentioned plots of land situated by the side of the relevant by-lane. Having considered the

several averments of the Petition filed by Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal, I am of

the view that the said Petition is a petition misconceived in law as it does not set out any legal

basis upon which the Court of Appeal could have considered the prayers for the issuance of

writs.

[SC Appeal 66/2013] Page 4 of 10

I also have to observe at this juncture the followings: the Petitioner-Appellant has not made

any of those persons who were involved in the above dispute, parties to the writ application

he had filed in the Court of Appeal; some of the said parties had in fact subsequently filed an

application to intervene in to the case filed by the Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal;

the Petitioner-Appellant had objected to their intervention in the Court of Appeal; the Court

of Appeal by order dated 07-03-2008 had upheld this objection and refused permission for

those parties to intervene in this case. I observe that one such party that sought intervention

in this case was Gamini Jayaweera Fernando who is admittedly the owner of the soil rights of

this by-lane.1

In my view, it is not reasonable for the Petitioner-Appellant to take such high ground to ensure

the exclusion of the afore-stated relevant persons involved in this dispute from these

proceedings. In as much as the Petitioner-Appellant has agitated for some grievance, the

afore-stated parties are also interested in placing their side of the story before court. This is

particularly because, this is basically a dispute between two parties rather than a dispute

between the Petitioner-Appellant and the relevant Urban Council. Indeed, the Urban Council

has taken steps to publish the impugned Gazette notification produced marked X 32 (in the

Petition to this Court dated 24-02-2012), only at the request of the afore-stated parties who

made such request in X 10 in the Petition to this Court dated 24-02-2012. For the above

reasons, I am of the view that the Petitioner-Appellant had failed to add necessary parties to

his petition filed before the Court of Appeal and that would be fatal to his case.

The Petitioner-Appellant relies on the Deed No. 416 attested on 01-04-1993 by

Singappuliarachchige Don Susil Premajayanth Nortary Public3, to assert his right to the

disputed by-lane. However, both according to the Petitioner-Appellant's Deed and his

Pleadings, he has only acquired a servitude of a Right of Way over the relevant disputed by-

lane. Thus, his interest to the relevant by-lane in the circumstances of this case, must be

viewed only as an interest of a person who has acquired such servitude of right of way over

that by-lane.

The 1st Respondent-Respondent in his statement of objections dated 04-04-2008 filed before

the Court of Appeal4, has taken up the position that afore-stated Gamini Jayaweera Fernando

who enjoys the soil rights of the relevant by-lane, together with several others occupying the

afore-stated several other plots of lands situated by the side of this by-lane, by the document

produced marked R 25 (in the Court of Appeal) had requested the Urban Council to develop

and maintain this by-lane. R 2 is dated 21-09-2002 and signed by: Gamini Fernando (Owner

of Assessment No. 50/1, 50/A and 50/B); D. S. Weerasuriya (Owner of Assessment No. 52);

R. P. P. A. Samarasinghe (Owner of Assessment No. 48); S. J. P. A. Samarasinghe (Owner of

Assessment No. 48/2); and S. P. A. Samarasinghe (Owner of Assessment No.48/3).

According to Deed No. 1596 attested on 14-09-19966, the original owner Jayaweerage David

Fernando who is the father of Jayaweerage Gamini Fernando had gifted the properties bearing

Assessment Numbers 50 and 50/1 and the relevant by-lane to said Jayaweerage Gamini

Fernando. The three plots of land above mentioned, appear to have been depicted in plan No.

2470 dated 30-01-1990 prepared by D. C. Hettige Licensed Surveyor. The two plots of land

bearing assessment Nos. 50 and 50/1, are Lot Numbers 1 and 2 depicted in that plan and the

by-lane is depicted as Lot 2 in the said plan. The Petitioner-Appellant has not produced this

plan in Court. According to deed No. 1596, Lot 2 is a road reservation dedicated for common

use. Be that as it may, as per the Second Schedule of the Deed No. 1596 dated 14-09-1996

attested by S. R. Kalurathna Notary Public, Gamini Fernando has soil rights over the strip of

land (in dispute) in extent of A0: R0: P0630 which is the by-lane relevant to this case.

However, the Petitioner-Appellants entitlement is only limited to the use of it as a right of

way.

Since the Urban Council has acted under Sections 50 and 52 of the Urban Councils Ordinance,

let me at this juncture reproduce those two sections here for convenience.

Section 50 of the Urban Councils Ordinance:

Power of Urban Council to construct new, and improve existing, thoroughfares.

The Urban Council of each town may within that town

(a) lay out and construct new roads, streets, bridges, or other

thoroughfares;

(b) widen, open, or enlarge any street or other thoroughfare (not being

a principal thoroughfare);

5 Also produced marked X 10 in the Petition to the Supreme Court dated 24-02-2012 and produced marked Z in

the Counter Objections filed by the 1st to the 5th intervenient Petitioners in the Court of Appeal on 14-02-2008.

6 Produce marked R 1 in the statement of objections filed before the Court of Appeal on 04-04-2008.

[SC Appeal 66/2013] Page 6 of 10

(c) turn, divert, discontinue, or stop up, whether in whole or in part,

any public street or other thoroughfare (not being a principal

thoroughfare),

making due compensation to the owners or occupiers of any property required

for such purposes, or any person whose legal rights are thereby infringed.

Section 52 of the Urban Councils Ordinance:

Gifts of land required for diversion or enlargement of thoroughfares.

If in connexion with the turning, diversion, widening, opening, enlargement or

improvement of any thoroughfare, it becomes necessary for any Urban Council

to take possession of the land of any person for public use, and if the person

claiming to be the owner of the land desires to make a free gift of the land to

the Council for such purpose and to renounce all claim to compensation

therefor, a record in writing to that effect duly signed by such person in the

presence of the Chairman or of a person authorized by the Chairman in writing

in that behalf shall be sufficient to vest the land in the Council. No such record

shall be deemed to be invalid or of no effect in law by reason only that the

requirements of section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance have not been

complied with as to attestation by a notary public and by witnesses.

According to Section 52 of the Urban Councils Ordinance when the owner of the land makes

a free gift of his land, to the Council for the purpose of developing it as a roadway, renouncing

all his claims for compensation thereto, it would be sufficient for such land to be vested in the

Council. The only other requirement under the above section is that such gift must be in

writing, duly signed by such person in the presence of a Chairman or a person authorized by

the Chairman in writing. The above requirements can be broken down to four distinct items

to facilitate its convenient analysis. They are as follows:

1. The owner of the land who desires to make a free gift of the land must make a record

in writing of his desire to make a free gift of the land to the Council for such purpose.

2. He must renounce all claims to compensation thereto.

3. He must duly sign such record by himself.

4. The signing must be done in the presence of the Chairman or of a person authorized

by the Chairman in writing in that behalf.

[SC Appeal 66/2013] Page 7 of 10

Another important factor which needs specific attention is that the said section has also

relaxed the application of Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, which is the

requirement of such writing to have been attested by a Notary Public and witnesses. Thus,

such record will not be invalid for non-compliance of Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance. In other words, according to Section 52 of the Urban Councils Ordinance, the

requirements of attestation by a Notary Public and making such record in the presence of

witnesses are not mandatory requirements for a valid vesting as per that section.

Let me now consider the letter (produced marked X 10) written by said Gamini Fernando,

gifting the relevant soil rights to the 1st Respondent Council has complied with the above

requirements. It is this document that the 1st Respondent-Respondent relies on, to convince

this Court that the 1st Respondent Urban Council had complied with the provisions in Section

52 of the Urban Councils Ordinance.

Let me consider the afore-stated first requirement. The first requirement is the presence of a

record in writing, and this is satisfied by the letter produced marked X 10 by the Respondents-

Respondents. In the letter X 10, the signatories clearly and unconditionally request

Maharagama Urban Council (the 1st Respondent-Respondent) to take steps to acquire this by-

lane and develop it as a tarred public roadway. They also request the 1st Respondent-

Respondent to fix streetlamps for the common benefit of all users. This letter by itself is

evidence that the first of the afore-stated requirements has been complied with.

The second requirement is a renunciation of compensation by those who gift it to the Urban

Council. What is required according to Section 52 is a record in writing to that effect. Looking

at X 10 as a whole, it is clear that those who had gifted the by-lane to the Urban Council have

not sought any compensation in that regard from the Urban Council. They have not even

made any such remote indication that they anticipate any compensation when the by-lane is

vested in the Urban Council. For those reasons, I hold that there has in fact been a

renunciation of compensation for the land by those who had gifted it to the Urban Council.

Therefore, I hold that the second of the above requirements has also been complied with.

Thirdly, since the owner of the soil rights who made this free gift to the Council is a signatory

to the letter X 10. Thus, the third requirement that the record must be signed by the maker

of such free gift has also been complied with.

The fourth requirement is the signature of the Chairman, or an individual appointed by the

Chairman in writing. On the face of it there is no record to establish that the letter X 10 was

signed before either the Chairman of the Urban Council, or an individual appointed by the

Chairman.

The letter X 10 has been directly addressed to Chairman Maharagama Urban Council which

has been received by it according to the stamp placed thereon by Maharagama Urban Council).

[SC Appeal 66/2013] Page 8 of 10

The letter X 10 indicates that it has been copied to R. H. Ranjith, a Member of Maharagama

Urban Council.

The letter dated 10-02-2003 addressed to the Chairman Maharagama Urban Council by R. H.

Ranjith (the member of the Maharagama Urban Council) has also made the same request to

the 1st Respondent-Respondent. The Chairman of Maharagama Urban Council who stands as

the 1st Respondent-Respondent in this case has never ever challenged the fact that the free

gift has in fact been made as per the letter X 10 by its signatories. Indeed, the position taken

up by the 1st Respondent-Respondent is that Maharagama Urban Council set the rest of the

procedure in motion as per the request in letter X 10. The said procedure was to have the

by-lane vested in the Maharagama Urban Council in terms of Section 52 of the Urban Councils

Ordinance. The Petitioner-Appellant himself, had admitted that the relevant vesting of the by-

lane had been initiated upon a proposal presented to Maharagama Urban Council by one of

its Member7.

While the 1st Respondent-Respondent or its Chairman has never ever challenged the letter X

10, the fact remains that they had indeed acted and relied upon X 10.

It is also of paramount importance that the 1st Respondent-Respondent Maharagama Urban

Council, had even proceeded to conduct an inquiry before it had acted on the request made

in X 10. This inquiry was conducted in view of the objection raised by the Petitioner-Appellant

to the proposed vesting. It is relevant to note that even the Petitioner-Appellant has admitted

that it was upon his request for an inquiry that the 1st Respondent-Respondent had summoned

all parties to the dispute and proceeded to hold an inquiry. The Petitioner-Appellant had

admittedly placed all material facts before this inquiry.8

On the other hand, it is not the position of the Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal,

that X 10 was invalid because it did not comply with the aforementioned 4th requirement. I

find no trace of anything even remotely connected to non-compliance of Section 52 has ever

been agitated as a ground for claiming the Writ of Certiorari in the Petition filed by the

Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal. Therefore, that ground appears to be an

afterthought entertained by the Petitioner-Appellant after conclusion of the case in the Court

of Appeal. The Respondents have had no opportunity to meet or answer such ground when

they had presented their case in the Court of Appeal. This appeal has been lodged against the

Court of Appeal decision pronounced in respect of the case it had heard. Therefore, this Court

cannot permit the Petitioner-Appellant to advance a case materially different to what was

presented before the original court. It is trite law that no person in the course of hearing the

7 Paragraph 17 of Petition dated 16-10-2007 filed in the Court of Appeal.

8 Paragraph 11 of Petition dated 16-10-2007 filed in the Court of Appeal.

[SC Appeal 66/2013] Page 9 of 10

Appeal, can advance a case materially different to what was presented before the original

court.

For the above reasons, I am not inclined to hold that the vesting of the by-lane in Maharagama

Urban Council through the process that the 1st Respondent had followed, is bad in law merely

because one could not find any writing on the face of letter X 10 to the effect that it was

signed in the presence of the Chairman or of a person authorized by Chairman in writing in

that regard. This is particularly because the authenticity of X 10 was never in issue before

the Court of Appeal.

Perusal of the Petition presented to the Court of Appeal by the Petitioner-Appellant produced

marked X 2 in this case, shows clearly that the main ground on which the Petitioner-Appellant

had presented his case to the Court of Appeal is that the primary court of Gangodawila in an

application filed before it under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, had made an

order on 12-09-19969 that Premasiri Gamage (owner of assessment No. 52 Jambugasmulla

Mawatha), had no right to use the right of way over this by-lane. The Petitioner-Appellant had

also highlighted the fact that the High Court of Colombo upon an Application for Revision filed

in that regard by said Premasiri Gamage, had affirmed the aforesaid primary court Order10. It

was the position of the Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal that aforesaid Premasiri

Gamage who had claimed a right of way in the aforesaid Primary Court case, has gained

improper advantage due to this vesting despite a Primary Court ruling against him. With regard

to this argument, suffice it to state here that any entitlement or non-entitlement for a servitude

of Right of Way under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act cannot hinder such

person using a public road even if it is the same roadway which had earlier stood as a private

road. Therefore, in my view this is not a valid ground for the Court of Appeal to issue a Writ

of Certiorari which the Petitioner-Appellant had sought from it.

Although the Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal had stated that the 1st Respondent-

Respondent had proceeded with the process of vesting without a proper technical report being

obtained I see no merit or substance in such argument. This is because the identity of the by-

lane was never in dispute between the parties and was clear in everyones mind throughout

the proceedings.

For the reasons set out above and having regard to the nature of the questions of law in

respect of which this Court has granted Special Leave to Appeal I hold as follows:

9 Produced marked P 7(b) in the Petition to the Court of Appeal dated 16-10-2007 and produced marked X 5 in

the Petition to the Supreme Court dated 24-02-2012.

10 Produced marked P 8 in the Petition to the Court of Appeal dated 16-10-2007 and produced marked X 6 in the

Petition to the Supreme Court dated 24-02-2012.

[SC Appeal 66/2013] Page 10 of 10

I. The letter dated 21-09-2002 produced marked X 10 can be taken as a "free gift" within

the meaning of Section 52 of the Urban Councils' Ordinance.

II. the vesting of the disputed private roadway by the Gazette Notification No. 1461 dated

01-09-2006 (produced marked X 3) complied with the imperative requirements in

Section 52 of the Urban Councils Ordinance.

III. The fact that the Petitioner-Appellant has not signed the letter dated 21-09-2002 X 10

is not relevant as he does not have soil rights to the by-lane. His right of way can

continue without any hindrance even after vesting the by-lane in the Urban Council as

a public road.

I hold that the Court of Appeal has correctly held that in the circumstances of this case, there

is no illegality or irrationality in the vesting. I also hold that the Court of Appeal has correctly

held that if the Petitioner challenges the free gift of the said by-lane by said Gamini Fernando

on the basis that he has no soil rights on the said strip of land it cannot be decided in this

case as it involves disputed questions of facts.

I proceed to dismiss this appeal but without costs.
