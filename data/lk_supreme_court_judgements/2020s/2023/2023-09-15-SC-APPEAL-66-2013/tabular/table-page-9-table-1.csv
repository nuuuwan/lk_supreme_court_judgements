"Appeal,  can  advance  a  case  materially  different  to  what  was  presented  before  the  original"
"court."
"For the above reasons, I am not inclined to hold that the vesting of the by-lane in Maharagama"
"Urban Council through the process that the 1st Respondent had followed, is bad in law merely"
"because one could not find any writing on the face of letter X 10 to the effect that it was"
"signed in the presence of the Chairman or of a person authorized by Chairman in writing in"
"that regard. This is particularly because the authenticity of X 10 was never in issue before"
"the Court of Appeal."
"Perusal of the Petition presented to the Court of Appeal by the Petitioner-Appellant produced"
"marked X 2 in this case, shows clearly that the main ground on which the Petitioner-Appellant"
"had presented his case to the Court of Appeal is that the primary court of Gangodawila in an"
"application filed before it under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, had made an"
"order on 12-09-19969 that Premasiri Gamage (owner of assessment No. 52 Jambugasmulla"
"Mawatha), had no right to use the right of way over this by-lane. The Petitioner-Appellant had"
"also highlighted the fact that the High Court of Colombo upon an Application for Revision filed"
"in that regard by said Premasiri Gamage, had affirmed the aforesaid primary court Order10. It"
"was the position of the Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal that aforesaid Premasiri"
"Gamage  who  had  claimed  a  right  of  way  in  the  aforesaid  Primary  Court  case,  has  gained"
"improper advantage due to this vesting despite a Primary Court ruling against him. With regard"
"to this argument, suffice it to state here that any entitlement or non-entitlement for a servitude"
"of Right of Way under Section 66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act cannot hinder such"
"person using a public road even if it is the same roadway which had earlier stood as a private"
"road. Therefore, in my view this is not a valid ground for the Court of Appeal to issue a Writ"
"of Certiorari which the Petitioner-Appellant had sought from it."
"Although the Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal had stated that the 1st Respondent-"
"Respondent had proceeded with the process of vesting without a proper technical report being"
"obtained I see no merit or substance in such argument. This is because the identity of the by-"
"lane was never in dispute between the parties and was clear in everyoneâ€™s mind throughout"
"the proceedings."
"For  the  reasons  set  out  above  and  having  regard  to  the  nature  of  the  questions  of  law  in"
"respect of which this Court has granted Special Leave to Appeal I hold as follows:"
"9 Produced marked P 7(b) in the Petition to the Court of Appeal dated 16-10-2007 and produced marked X 5 in"
"the Petition to the Supreme Court dated 24-02-2012."
"10 Produced marked P 8 in the Petition to the Court of Appeal dated 16-10-2007 and produced marked X 6 in the"
"Petition to the Supreme Court dated 24-02-2012."
