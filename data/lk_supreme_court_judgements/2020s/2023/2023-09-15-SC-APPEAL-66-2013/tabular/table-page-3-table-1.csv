"[SC Appeal 66/2013] Page 3 of 10"
"At the outset, I must state that the Petition dated 16-10-2007 filed by the Petitioner in the"
"Court of Appeal which had sought the above Writ, has not set out any legal basis upon which"
"the Court of Appeal could have acted in order to consider issuing the writ prayed for by the"
"Petitioner-Appellant."
"When filing a writ application any petitioner is obliged to state in its petition the legal basis"
"upon which he/she seeks the writs prayed for in its petition. This is necessary because the"
"court is required to consider such application by applying the relevant law applicable to the"
"legal basis stated in such application. For example, some of such bases which could be cited"
"in such petitions are illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety etc. whatever such basis"
"would be, it must be clearly discernible from the petition filed by such petitioner in Court. This"
"is because Article 140 of the Constitution has only empowered the Court of Appeal to grant"
"and  issue,  according  to  law,  orders  in  the  nature  of  writs  of  certiorari,  prohibition,"
"procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against any public authority. The law applicable to"
"one ground differs from another and that is why the compliance of the requirement to clearly"
"state the legal basis in a petition is necessary."
"There is another important reason as to why this should be so. The public authorities who"
"have  been  made  respondents  to  such  writ  applications  are  required  to  defend  themselves"
"against  the  allegations  that  may  have  been  levelled  against  them.  They  generally  conduct"
"their  defences  with  the  help  of  legal  assistance  from  lawyers.  Thus,  it  is  of  paramount"
"importance not only for any such respondent in such writ application, but also for his/ her"
"lawyers who would appear for such respondent, to know exactly the legal basis upon which a"
"writ has been sought from court against such respondent under Article 140 of the Constitution."
"Any petition which does not comply with the afore-said requirement at least remotely, would"
"therefore be a petition which is misconceived in law."
"A closer look at the Petition filed by the Petitioner-Appellant, shows that the several averments"
"in the Petition only contain the sequence of events of certain incidents. They merely have set"
"out the factual background of a dispute to the relevant by-lane that had existed between the"
"Petitioner-Appellant  and  certain  other  parties  who  are  residents  of  some  of  the  afore-"
"mentioned plots of land situated by the side of the relevant by-lane. Having considered the"
"several averments of the Petition filed by Petitioner-Appellant in the Court of Appeal, I am of"
"the view that the said Petition is a petition misconceived in law as it does not set out any legal"
"basis upon which the Court of Appeal could have considered the prayers for the issuance of"
"writs."
