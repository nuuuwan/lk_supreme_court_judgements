"I.","The letter dated 21-09-2002 produced marked X 10 can be taken as a ""free gift"" within"
"","the meaning of Section 52 of the Urban Councils' Ordinance."
"II.","the vesting of the disputed private roadway by the Gazette Notification No. 1461 dated"
"","01-09-2006  (produced  marked  X  3)  complied  with  the  imperative  requirements  in"
"","Section 52 of the Urban Councils Ordinance."
"III.","The fact that the Petitioner-Appellant has not signed the letter dated 21-09-2002 X 10"
"","is  not  relevant  as  he  does  not  have  soil  rights  to  the  by-lane.  His  right  of  way  can"
"","continue without any hindrance even after vesting the by-lane in the Urban Council as"
"","a public road."
