"to make her full claim as required by section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code and therefore,"
"she was not entitled for the additional relief granted by the learned District judge."
"Moreover,  the  plaintiff  did  not  amend  the  plaint  to  include  a  prayer  for  ejectment  of  the"
"defendants  and  they  became  aware  of  the  new  issue  framed  by  the  learned  District  Court"
"Judge only at the time of delivery of the judgment. In the circumstances, it was submitted that"
"the defendants  were not  heard or allowed to  adduce evidence  as  to  why  the  said  new issue"
"relating to the ejectment should not be answered in favour of the plaintiff."
"He drew the attention of court to the judgment delivered in Hameed V Cassim (1996) 2 SLR"
"30,  which  the  learned  District  Judge  and  the  learned  judges  of  the  High  Court  based  their"
"decision  and  submitted  that  it  is  distinguishable  from  the  instant  appeal  as  in  the  said"
"judgment no relief was granted which was not prayed for. Thus, the said judgment does not"
"support the impuned judgment. Further, it was submitted that the plaintiff had not prayed for"
"the  ejectment  of  the  defendants  and  hence,  the  court  cannot  grant  a  relief  which  was  not"
"prayed for by a party."
"The learned Presidentâ€™s Counsel further submitted that in Perera V Perera 68 NLR 262, the"
"plaintiffs-respondents  filed an action for a declaration that they were entitled to draw water"
"from a well and for a sum of Rs.250/- as damages for being deprived of that right. Moreover,"
"after the plaintiffs-respondents obtained a decree moved for a writ of possession, which was"
"allowed. Thereafter, in Appeal, it was contented that the right to draw water carries the right"
"to  use  a  footpath.  It  was  held  that  the  question  to  be  decided  was  whether  the  plaintiffs-"
"respondents  having  failed  to  ask  for  anything  more  than  a  declaration  of  their  right  and"
"damages, can now ask for a writ of possession. The appeal should be allowed."
