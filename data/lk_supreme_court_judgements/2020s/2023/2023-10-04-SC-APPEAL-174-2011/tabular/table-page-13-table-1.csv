aving considered the evidence led at the trial and the issues framed by the parties, I am of"
"the opinion that there is no element of surprise by raising the additional issue by the learned"
"District Judge at the time of the delivery of the judgment. Further the learned District Judge"
"in framing the new issue has taken steps to arrive at the correct decision with regard to the"
"dispute  between  the  parties  to  the  case.  Further,  it  prevents  further  litigation  between  the"
"parties and thus, raising the said additional issue is necessary to meet the ends of justice."
