"In Silva v. Obeysekera 24 NLR 97 it was held in the preamble;"
"“No  doubt  it  is  a  matter  within  the  discretion  of  the  Judge  whether  he  will"
"allow  fresh  issues  to  be  formulated  after  the  case  has  commenced,  but  he"
"should do so when such a course appears to be in the interests of justice, and"
"it is certainly not a valid objection to such a course being taken that they do"
"not arise on the pleadings.”"
