"T
 
he aforementioned provisions show that though the Civil Procedure Code contemplates an"
"adversarial procedure, it casts a duty on the learned judge of the District  Court to mark the"
"admissions and raise issues in order to arrive at the right decision in the case."
"D
id  the  learned  District  Judge  err  in  law  by  framing  the  issue  No.  13  (new  issue)"
"referred to above at  the time of the delivery of the judgment under section 149 of the"
"said Code, without giving an opportunity to the parties to respond to the said issue?"
"Section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code states;"
"“The court may, at any time before passing a decree, amend the issues or frame"
"additional issues on such terms as it thinks fit.”"
"[Emphasis added]"
"Section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code does not preclude a District Judge from framing a"
"new  issue  after  the  parties  have  concluded  their  respective  cases  and  at  the  time  of  the"
"judgment is read out in open Court. On the contrary, it allows the District Judge to amend or"
"frame additional issues before passing a decree."
"However, a careful consideration of the provisions of the said Code shows that section 149 of"
"the  Code  cannot  be  considered  in  isolation.  Hence,  the  said  section  should  be  considered"
"along with the other sections applicable to framing of issues and be interpreted in harmony"
"with  them.  The  analysis  of  the  said  provisions  in  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  show  that  the"
"power conferred on the  District  Court by section 149 of the said  Code to amend the issues"
"before  passing  a  decree  is  subject  to  the  other  restrictions  imposed  by  the  Code.  When  the"
"sections  relating  to  such  matters  are  considered  together  the  cumulative  effect  is  that  the"
"discretion conferred by section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code on the District Court should"
"be exercised subject to the following;"
"(a)  a new issue cannot be framed which will have the effect of converting an action of"
"one character into another,"
