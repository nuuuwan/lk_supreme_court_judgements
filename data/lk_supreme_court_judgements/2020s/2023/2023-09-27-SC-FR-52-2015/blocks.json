Hence,equality before the law does not mean that things which are different shall betreated as they were the same. Thus, the principle of equality enacted underArticle 12 does not absolutely prevent the State from differentiating betweenpersons and things.The State has the powerofwhatis known an''classification'' on a basis of rational distinction relevant to the particularsubject dealt with. So long as all persons failing into the same class aretreated alike there is no question of discrimination and there is no question ofviolating the equality clause.The discrimination which is prohibited istreatment in a manner prejudicial as compared to another person in similarcircumstances. Discrimination is the essence of classification; so long as itrests on a reasonable basis there is no violation of the constitutional rights ofequality.",
