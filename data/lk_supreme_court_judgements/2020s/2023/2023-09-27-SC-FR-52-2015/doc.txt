K. KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J.

This is an Application filed under Article 126(1) of the Constitution by thePetitioners seeking, inter alia, for a declaration that their fundamental rightsto equality before the law and equal protection of the law as guaranteed byArticle 12(1) of the Constitution and freedom of occupation as guaranteed byArticle 14(1)(g) have been violated, as a result of the arbitrary, capriciousand/or irrational manner in which the Petitioners were deprived of theirappointments to the rank of Assistant Security Officer, in contravention ofestablished procedures and assurances of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority(hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent).

On 13.08.2015, having heard the Counsel for the Petitioners in support ofthis Application and the Learned DSG who appeared for the Respondents,this court granted leave to proceed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioners, aged 53-56 years at the time of filing this Application, havejoined the 1st Respondent between 1981 and 1986, as Security Guards. Atthe time of filing this Application, they were serving as Security Sergeants.They have been appointed to the said positions after a written examinationand an interview.

3

The Petitioners have become aware of an internal notice dated 11.02.2013calling applications for appointments of Assistant Security Officers, andhave submitted the duly completed application forms as required, whichhave been then accepted by the 1st Respondent. The requisite applicationform at clause 11 specifically provided for applicants who were 50 years andabove, to notify the 1st Respondent whether they would opt to sit for awritten examination or not, to which all the Petitioners in their respectiveapplicationformsoptednottofacesuchwrittenexamination.ThePetitioners state that the accepted practice at the 1st Respondent has beento permit applicants who are over 50 years of age who apply for internalappointments, to forego a written examination and have their internalappointments based solely on the interview process. They further state thatapproximately 30% of vacancies are, as a practice, set aside for suchmethod of internal appointments. The Petitioners have later found out thatsuch established practice is based on Circular 16/2003 dated 28.05.2002.

However, the Petitioners state that they were asked by the officers of themanagement of the 1st Respondent to nominally sit for the said writtenexamination, with the assurance that their appointments would be solelybased on their performances at the interview. Accordingly, the Petitionershavenominallysatforthesaidwrittenexaminationonoraround13.03.2014 on the said verbal assurance that their performances at thewritten examination would not be a deciding factor in being chosen for theappointments.

The results of the said written examination were released in or around July2014, according to which the Petitioners have obtained average marksbetween 50 to 62, as against the pass mark of 40. Soon after, the Petitionersexcept the 1st Petitioner have been summoned for interviews. The saidPetitionershaveattended the said interview and later, on or around22.09.2014, they have become aware that approximately 46 individuals, amajority of whom are junior to the Petitioners, have been appointed asAssistant Security Officers based on their performances at the writtenexamination and interview. However, none of the Petitioners were includedamongst the said appointments. Thereafter, the Petitioners have madeseveral representations to the management of the 1st Respondent enquiringas to the prospects of their appointments to the said position, to no avail.

ThePetitionersstatethattheassurancesmadeto them by the 1stRespondent and/or its officers that the Petitioners need only nominally sitfor the written examination, and the results thereon would not be a decidingfactor in being appointed to the rank of Assistant Security Officer gave riseto a legitimate expectation that they would be considered for appointments

4

to the said positions, as the verbal assurances made to that effect were clearand unambiguous which were reasonable for the Petitioners to rely on.Moreover, they claim that the conduct and established practice of the said1st Respondent of allocating 30% of vacancies to be filled by those above theage of 50 years, disregarding the written examination and based solely onthe interview further engendered in them a legitimate expectation that suchestablished practice would be followed in respect of the appointments of thePetitioners as well.

In the circumstances, the Petitioners plead that their fundamental rightsguaranteed under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution havebeen violated by the Respondents for the reasons of acting contrary topubliclydisclosedcriteriaasstipulatedinCircular16/2003andestablished practice pertaining to appointments of persons above 50 years ofage, failing to disclose the number of vacancies for the rank of AssistantSecurity Officer and such being done for a collateral purpose, appointingofficers junior to the Petitioners to positions senior to the Petitioners inviolation of published criteria and established practice, and in breach of theprinciples of natural justice and legitimate expectations of the Petitioners.

Accordingly, this Court granted leave to proceed for the alleged infringementof fundamental rights of the Petitioners as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of theConstitution.

Thereafter, the Chairman of the 1st Respondent filed an affidavit dated26.11.2015 and stated, inter alia, that the 3rd Petitioner was promoted to thepostofAssistantSecurityOfficeron08.09.2015witheffectfrom03.26.2015. He further stated that the application forms issued to some ofthe Petitioners, with the exception of the 5th Petitioner who had filled thecorrect application form, contained the option to indicate whether they optto sit for a written examination or not. Such application forms were in factoldapplicationforms,preparedbasedonthepreviousSchemeofRecruitment which was in place prior to the establishment of the presentlyapplicableSchemeofRecruitment.Thus, he contended that Circular16/2003 is no longer in force, in view of the notice calling for applicationsdated 11.02.2013, which is the presently applicable Scheme of Recruitment.The said notice calling for applications contains the requirement to sit for awritten examination. As such, the Chairman of the 1st Respondent in hisaffidavit further stated that it had been an inadvertence on part of theofficers who issued the application forms as well as the officers whoaccepted the duly filled application forms.

5

He further stated that the Petitioners secured 27.94, 33.91, 24.60, 29.33,and 31.62 marks respectively, at the written examination and the 1st

Petitioner was in fact unsuccessful at the said written examination.

The Chairman of the 1st Respondent also stated that the relevant noticecalling applications for the positions of Assistant Security Officers filed bythe Petitioners is incomplete as it contains only two pages as opposed to theactual notice which contained three pages. Therefore, the Petitioners havedeliberately/mistakenly left out the actual page two of the said notice whichdiscloses the necessity to sit for a written examination. He further claimedthat pages of the said notice have not been numbered properly as both thesecond and third pages of the said notice have been numbered as page 2.

Moreover, he stated that the said notice was published on 11.02.2013 andthe Petitioners cannot now claim that they were unaware of the requirementto sit for a written examination, and if they were aggrieved by the saidrequirement, they could have taken appropriate measures soon after. Hefurther stated that the 3rd Petitioner was informed of the requirement to sitforawrittenexamination,towhichallthePetitionerssubsequentlycomplied.

He has denied the remaining averments which are inconsistent with what isstatedaboveandstatedthattheRespondentshavenotviolatedfundamental rights of the Petitioners, they are not entitled to any of thereliefs sought and the Application should accordingly be dismissed.

ThePetitionersintheirCounterObjectionsstatedthattheletterofappointment of the 3rd Respondent had been issued after the filing of theinstant Application and the said letter of appointment, in any event, affectedhis seniority since others similarly circumstanced as the Petitioners havebeen so appointed with effect from at least 10.09.2014. Further, thePetitioners stated that the notice they have submitted to Court was thenotice that was available to them at the time of filing this Application. Assuch, the notice calling for applications submitted by the Chairman of the1st Respondent in his Affidavit, marked 2R2, was not the documentavailable to the them. Moreover, the Petitioners claimed that the applicationforms that they submitted were in fact accepted by the 1st Respondent andthey were never informed of any defect when the said applications wereaccepted.

The Petitioners stated that the Respondents acted contrary to the disclosedcriteria in Circular 16/2003 and have failed to disclose any change in suchcriteria. Therefore, such criteria are still in force and as such, 2R2 is void abinitio.

6

The Respondents in their further written submissions stated that by ajoint-motion dated 08.12.2021, the Letters of Promotion of the 1st, 2nd, 4th

and 5th Petitioners to the rank of Assistant Security Officer were tendered asdirected by the Court. The said promotions were granted based on aNotification issued in 2017, applications submitted by the said Petitionersand based on interviews held in 2018, pursuant to the filing of thisApplication and tendering of Objections on behalf of the Respondents. TheRespondents further stated that the Petitioners have now retired fromservice and therefore, the only remaining issue is with regard to the effectivedate of promotions to the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th Petitioners to the said posts.

Accordingly, the Respondents have submitted that the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th

Petitioners were promoted as Assistant Security Officers based on a processwhich commenced subsequent to the filing of this Application and they werenot eligible to be promoted to the said posts based on the process whichcommenced in 2013. Therefore, the Respondents have not infringed uponthe fundamental rights of the Petitioners as guaranteed by Article 12(1) ofthe Constitution.

Before moving to determine the Application of the Petitioners upon itsmerits, I have to first consider the preliminary objection taken by theRespondents in their written submissions that the Petitioners Application istime barred and therefore, it should be dismissed as the Petitioners havefailed to comply with the mandatory time limit requirement prescribed inArticle 126(2) of the constitution.

Article 126(2) reads as follows;

Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language rightrelating to such person has been infringed or is about to be infringed byexecutive or administrative action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law onhis behalf, within one month thereof, in accordance with such rules of court asmay be in force, apply to the Supreme Court by way of petition in writingaddressed to such Court praying for relief or redress in respect of suchinfringement

The effect of Article 126(2) as stipulated above is that a Petition alleging aninfringement or imminent infringement of fundamental rights should be filedwithin a period of one month of such alleged infringement or imminentinfringement and failure to comply with this requirement would render suchPetition time barred and unmaintainable.

Accordingly, the Respondents contend in their written submissions that theApplication of the Petitioners is time barred for the reason that it was

7

preferredon06.03.2015challengingthepurportednewSchemeofRecruitment, marked 2R2, introduced on 11.02.2013.

This Court has time and again held that the time limit stipulated in Article126(2) is a mandatory requirement.

In the case of Demuni Sriyani de Zoysa and others v. DharmasenaDissanayakeandothers[SC(FR)206/2008,SCMinutesof09.12.2016], Prasanna Jayawardena, PC., J. observed that;

The rule that, an application under Article 126 which has not been filedwithin one month of the occurrence of the alleged infringement will make thatapplication unmaintainable, has been enunciated time and again from thetime this Court exercised the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction conferred uponit by the 1978 Constitution. Thus, in EDIRISURIYA Vs. NAVARATNAM [19851 SLR 100 at p.105- 106], Ranasinghe J, as he then was, stated ThisCourt has consistently proceeded on the basis that the time limit of one monthset out in Article 126 (2) of the Constitution is mandatory..

In the above case, the Petitioners contended that failure of the Respondentsto allocate marks in the selection process for Class II Grade II of the SriLanka Administrative Service for the period the Petitioners served on asupernumerary basis in the Supra Class of the General Clerical Service andsubsequently, in the Public Management Assistants Service, amounted to aviolation of their fundamental rights as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of theConstitution. The said selection process was based on the CombinedServices Circular No. 01/2007 issued on 05.02.2007 by the Secretary of theMinistry of Public Administration and Home Affairs. The Petitioners hadbeen well aware that in terms of the said Circular they would not beallocated marks for their period of service on a supernumerary basis. Sincethe Petition was filed on 05.06.2008, 16 months after the said Circular wasissued, the Respondents contended that the Application of the Petitionerswas time barred. Prasanna Jayawardena, PC., J., upholding the saidpreliminary objection, elucidated that;

Therefore, it is clear that, the alleged infringement occurred on or soon after05th February 2007 when the Circular marked P9 was issued and madeknown to the Petitioners.

Therefore, it was held in the above case that;

The Petition has been filed on 05th June 2008 which is more than 16 monthsafterthe day the Petitioners themselves state the alleged infringementoccurred. Therefore, the Petition is time barred and liable to be dismissed

8

unless the Petitioners can seek an extension of the time limit on grounds that,they were prevented from filing the Petition earlier.

The case of Dayaratne and others v. National Savings Bank [2002] 3SLR 116 is also important in this regard, where Mark Fernando, J.observed that;

The first limb of the respondents preliminary objection is that after the lapseof one month the petitioners were not entitled to challenge the scheme ofpromotion. The 1st respondent was entitled, from time to time, and in theinterests of the institution, to lay down the basis on which employees wouldbe promoted, and that became part of the contract of employment. The schemeofpromotionpublishedon12.02.2001wasdirectlyandimmediatelyapplicable to the petitioners, and became part of the terms and conditions oftheir employment. If they did not consent to those terms and conditions, asbeing violative of their rights under Article 12, they should have complained tothis Court within one month. They failed to do so. Instead, they acquiesced inthose terms and conditions by applying for promotion without any protest. I,therefore, uphold the objection.

However, as held by Mark Fernando, J. in the case of Gamaethige v.Siriwardena [1988] 1 SLR 344, that in exceptional circumstances thisCourt has the discretion to entertain an application not made within thestipulated time limit.

While the time limit is mandatory, in exceptional cases on the application ofthe principle lex non cogit ad impossibilia, if there is no lapse, fault or delay onthe partofthe petitioner, this Court has a discretion to entertain anapplication made out of time.

A similar view was enunciated by Aluwihare, PC., J. in the case of K.H.G.Kithsiri v. Hon. Faizer Musthapha MP, Minister of Provincial Councilsand Local Government and others [SC (FR) 362/2017, SC Minutes of10.01.2018], as well.

This court, however, in exceptional circumstances where the Petitioner wasprevented, by reason beyond his control, from taking measures which wouldenable the filing of a Petition within one month of the alleged infringement andif there had been no lapse on the part of the Petitioner, has exercised itsdiscretion in entertaining fundamentalrights applications and had nothesitated to apply the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia.

Aluwihare, PC., J. further went onto state in the same case that;

9

the time limit of one month prescribed by Article 126 of the Constitution toinvokethefundamentalrightsjurisdictionforanallegedviolationismandatory. In a fit case, however, an application made outside the time limitof one month stipulated in Article 126 could be entertained where the delayhad resulted due to a reason or reasons as the case may be that are beyondthecontrolofthePetitionerorwhere the courtis satisfied thatthecircumstances prevailed at the time relevant, it would have been impossiblefor the Petitioner to have invoked the jurisdiction within 30 days and to bemore precise where the Principle lex non cogit ad impossibllia would beapplicable.

The contention of the Respondents in this case is that the Petitioners havepreferred this Application on 06.03.2015 challenging the purported newSchemeofRecruitmentintroducedon11.02.2013,and as such thisApplication is time barred. Further, the Respondents have also submittedthat the Petitioners have failed to establish that the reason they were unableto comply with the said time limit requirement as stipulated in Article 126(2)wasduetocircumstancesbeyondtheircontrolandtherefore,thisApplication should be dismissed.

However, the Petitioners claim that Circular No. 16/2003 is still in force anda valid rule within the Authority. As such, it must be followed until suchtime it is duly changed. It is their submission that the document marked2R2, which the Respondents state as being the new Scheme of Recruitment,is an internal notice calling for applications and therefore, it does not havethe power of overruling a Circular issued by the Chairman of the 1stRespondent.

Since the success of the preliminary objection taken by the Respondents iscontingent on the submission that a change of rule has taken place in viewof the document marked 2R2, I will firstly move to consider the contentionsof parties pertaining to the presently applicable Scheme of Recruitment inrespect of the Petitioners.

In examining the material placed before this Court, it is apparent that thedocument marked 2R2 is not numbered properly.Although the first pagehas been numbered correctly as page 1, both the second and third pageshave been numbered as page 2. This was also accepted as such by theRespondents themselves. Further, the application forms received by four outof the five Petitioners, with the sole exception of the 5th Petitioner, containedthe option to indicate their preference as to whether they are willing to sitfor the written examination or not. Thus, as pleaded by the Petitioners, an80% of application forms in the given instance can be deduced as beingbased on Circular 16/2003.

10

Although it is submitted by the Respondents that the said Circular is nolonger in force, the duly completed said application forms of the Petitionerswere in fact accepted by officers of the 1st Respondent. The Chairman of the1st Respondent stated in his Affidavit that it had been an inadvertence onpart of the officers who accepted the duly filled application forms. ThePetitioners state that thereafter, the officers of the management of the 1stRespondent have given assurances to the Petitioners that they need onlynominally sit for the said written examination. Further, the Petitioners werenever informed of the purported change in the said Scheme of Recruitmentuntil this matter was brought before this Court.

Moreover, the document marked 2R2, which the Respondents claim asbeing the presently applicable Scheme of Recruitment is a notice calling forapplications signed by the Chief Human Resource Manager of the 1stRespondent as opposed to Circular 16/2003, which is signed by the thenChairman of the 1st Respondent.

Section 17(1)(a) of the Interpretation Ordinance of Sri Lanka, which Ifind as directly applicable and conclusive in this regard, provides theprocedure for changing of rules as follows;

(1) Whereanyenactment,whetherpassedbeforeorafterthecommencement of this Ordinance, confers power on any authority tomake rules, the following provisions shall, unless the contrary intentionappears, have effect with reference to the making and operation of suchrules: -

(a) any rule may be amended, varied, rescinded, or revoked by

the same authority in the same manner by and in which itwas made;

Section 7(1)(e) of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act grants the 1stRespondent the power to make rules in relation to the officers and servantsof the Authority, including, inter alia, their appointments and promotions.Section 9 of the same Act holds the Chairman of the Sri Lanka PortsAuthority as being responsible for the administration of the affairs of thesaid Authority.

Thus, I am of the opinion that Circular 16/2003, as a rule applicable tointernal appointments issued in accordance with the aforesaid provisionswill cease to have force, only if another Circular to that effect is issued bythe Chairman of the said Authority himself, in light of Section 7(1)(e) andSection 9 of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act read together with Section17(1)(a) of the Interpretation Ordinance of Sri Lanka.

11

Therefore, after careful consideration of the law and discrepancies inherentin the submissions of the Respondents, I reject the argument of theRespondents that Circular 16/2003 is no longer in force in view of thedocument marked 2R2, and hold that Circular 16/2003 is still in force andas such, it is the presently applicable Scheme of Recruitment in respect ofthe Petitioners.

Accordingly, I also reject the preliminary objection of Respondents that theinstant Application is time barred as they have preferred the Application on06.03.2015 while the purported new Scheme of Recruitment was introducedon 11.02.2013, as I have already held that Circular 16/2003 is still in forceand has remained in force during the entirety of the time period concernedand is in fact the applicable Scheme of Recruitment to the Petitioners.

As leave to proceed was granted under Article 12(1) of the Constitution, it isnow necessary to analyze the relevant facts and material submitted beforethis Court to ascertain whether the decision of the 1st Respondent to departfrom Circular 16/2003 amounts to a violation of fundamental rights asaforesaid.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution reads as follows:

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protectionof the law.

The Respondents in their written submissions have brought forth thecontention that they have acted in good faith and in terms of the Scheme ofRecruitment marked 2R2. Thus, in order for the Petitioners to successfullyplead that their right to equality as guaranteed under Article 12(1) of theConstitution has been violated, they must prove that they were in factdiscriminated against other persons who were similarly circumstanced asthem, which they were in fact not in the current situation at hand. However,the Petitioners, on the other hand, have contended that the concept ofequality as guaranteed by Article 12(1) has since evolved and the violation ofa rule laid down by an authority would also amount to an infringement ofthe right to equality, as the Court has in several Judgments, focused on therequirementofensuringreasonablenessasopposedtorequiringarbitrariness to find an infringement of Article 12(1).

The former position taken up by the Respondents in respect of the right toequality was upheld in the case of Perera v. Jayawickrama [1985] 1 SLR285 by a Full Bench of this Court. The majority opinion delivered bySharvananda, CJ. held that;

12

This Article is violated both by unequal treatment of the equals and equaltreatment of the unequals. The aim of the article is to ensure that invidiousdistinction or arbitrary discrimination shall not be made by the State betweena citizen and a citizen who answers the same though the concept of equalitydoes not involve the idea of absolute equality among human beings. Hence,equality before the law does not mean that things which are different shall betreated as they were the same. Thus, the principle of equality enacted underArticle 12 does not absolutely prevent the State from differentiating betweenpersons and things.The State has the powerofwhatis known an''classification'' on a basis of rational distinction relevant to the particularsubject dealt with. So long as all persons failing into the same class aretreated alike there is no question of discrimination and there is no question ofviolating the equality clause.The discrimination which is prohibited istreatment in a manner prejudicial as compared to another person in similarcircumstances. Discrimination is the essence of classification; so long as itrests on a reasonable basis there is no violation of the constitutional rights ofequality.

However, the latter view taken up by the Petitioners was endorsed byWimalaratne, J., who delivered a dissenting opinion in the same case:

In order to establish discrimination, it is not necessary for the Petitioner toshow that correct procedure was applied in the case of others and that he hasbeen singled out for the adoption of a different procedure. Nor is it necessaryfor him to show that no others were victims of the wrong procedure nowapplied for the first time, perhaps in his case.

AnidenticalstancetothatoftheRespondentswasfollowedbySharvananda, CJ. in the case of C.W. Mackie and Company Ltd. v. HughMolagoda, Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and others [1986]1 SLR 300, where His Lordship held that;

In order to sustain the plea of discrimination based upon Article 12(1) a partywill have to satisfy the court about two things, namely (1) that he has beentreated differently from others, and (2) that he has been differently treatedfrom persons similarly circumstanced without any reasonable basis.

The requirement of proving unequal treatment was further emphasized byDr. Shirani Bandaranayake, J., in the case of Farook v. Dharmaratne,Chairman, Provincial Public Service Commission and others [2005] 1Sri LR 133, as follows;

. the petitioner quite clearly has sought to obtain relief on the basis ofunequaltreatment.Whenapersondoesnotpossesstherequired

13

qualifications that is necessary for a particular position, would it be possiblefor him to obtain relief in terms of a violation of his fundamental rights on thebasis of unequal treatment? If the answer to this question is in the affirmative,it would mean that Article 12(1) of the Constitution would be applicable evenin a situation where there is no violation of the applicable legal procedure orthe general practice. The application of Article 12(1) of the Constitution cannotbe used for such situations as it provides to an aggrieved person only for theequal protection of the law where the authorities have acted illegally orincorrectly without giving due consideration to the applicable guidelines.Article 12(1) of the Constitution does not provide for any situation where theauthorities will have to act illegally. The safeguard retained in Article 12(1) isfor the performance of a lawful act and not to be directed to carry out anillegal function. In order to succeed the petitioner must be in a position to placematerial before this Court that there has been unequal treatment within theframework of a lawful act.

InthecaseofThilakLalithaKumarav.S.S.Hewapathirana,Secretary, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development [SC (FR)451/2011, SC Minutes of 17.09.2015], Anil Gooneratne, J. dismissing anapplication claiming a violation of fundamental rights as guaranteed byArticle 12(1), also held that;

To survive equal protection attack the different treatment of two classes ofpersons must be justified by a relevant difference between them.

Similarly, in the case of Wasantha Disanayake and others v. Secretary,Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs and others (SC(FR) 611/2012, SC Minutes of 10.09.2015), K. Sripavan, CJ. held that itis necessary to show unequal treatment and discriminatory action againstthe Petitioners in pleading a violation of right to equality;

Article 12(1) of the Constitution contemplates the right to equality and statesthat, All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equalprotection of the law. What is meant here is that equals should be treatedequally and similar laws and regulations should be applicable to persons whoare similarly circumstanced. In reference to Article 12(1) of the Constitution, itwould be necessary to show that there had been unequal treatment, andtherefore, there exist discriminatory action against the Petitioners.

Further, in the more recent Judgment of R.M. Premil Priyalath de. Silvaandothersv.AkilaVirajKariyawasam(M.P),Hon.MinisterofEducation and others [SC (FR) 97/2015, SC Minutes of 20.02.2018],takingasimilar stance, Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC., J. referring to theJudgment in the case of Samadi Suharshana Ferdinandis and another

14

V. S.S.K. Aviruppola, Principal, Visakha Vidyalaya and others [S.C.F.R. No. 117/2011] held that;

As referred to above in this judgment, the Petitioners have failed to placebefore this court any material to establish that they were treated differentlyby any of the above Respondents when they decide not to admit the 3rdPetitionertoDharmashokaVidyalaya,Ambalangoda.Inthesaidcircumstances I hold that Petitioners have not been successful in establishingthat their fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12 (1) of theConstitution had been violated by the Respondents.

However, the latter view taken up by the Petitioners with regards to right toequality is supported by the case of Jayasinghe v. Attorney General[1994] 2 SLR 74, where Mark Fernando, J. took the view that the Courtmust take judicial notice in instances where the fundamental requirementsof justice and fair play were not followed. It was further stated in the samecase by Mark Fernando, J. that the Full Bench decision in the case ofPerera v. Jayawickrama is doubtful as to laying down an inflexibleprinciple of universal application and that the facts of each case must beconsidered in perusing a violation of Article 12(1):

I doubt whether that decision must be regarded as laying down an inflexibleprinciple of universal application: the facts of each case must be considered. Ifan employee alleges a denial of equal protection because he was compelled toparticipate in a disciplinary inquiry without ever being told what the chargesagainst him were, would a Court demand evidence to prove at least one othercontrary instance? I think not. The Court must take judicial notice, thatordinarily - and not merely in a few instances - charges are disclosed prior toinquiry.

Further, in the case of Wickremasinghe v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation[2001] 2 SLR 409, while holding that a decision of the RespondentCorporation to terminate the dealership of the Petitioner is violative of hisright to equality guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution, SarathN. Silva, CJ. took the view that;

The case of Perera v. Jayawickrema demonstrates the ineffectiveness ofthe guarantee in Article 12(1) which results from the rigid application of therequirement to prove that persons similarly circumstanced as the Petitionerwere differently treated. Such an application of the guarantee under Article12(1)ignorestheessenceofthebasicstandard which is to ensurereasonableness as opposed to arbitrariness in the manner required by thebasic standard.

15

This position was further strengthened by the recent Judgment in the caseof Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority [SC (FR) 256/17, SCMinutes of 11.12.2020], where Yasantha Kodagoda, PC., J. held that;

It is now well accepted that, the right to equality covers a much wider area,aimed at preventing other injustices too, that are recognized by law. Equalityis now a right as opposed to a mere privilege or an entitlement, and in thecontext of Sri Lanka a Fundamental Right, conferred on the people by theConstitution,forthepurposeofcuringnotonly injustices taking themanifestation of discrimination, but a host of other maladies recognized bylaw.

At p. 17 of the said Judgment, His Lordship further elaborated that theCourt has since moved on from the decision of Perera v. Jayawickrematowards a more progressive definition of the concept of equality;

Of course, since the pronouncement of the majority judgment in ElmorePererav.MajorMontagueJayawickrema,MinisterofPublicAdministration and Plantation Industries and Others, the SupremeCourt of Sri Lanka has somewhat distanced itself from the interpretationsprovided by Chief Justice S. Sharvananda to the concepts of equality anddiscrimination, and provided an expansive and more progressive definition ofthe concept of equality, founded upon the concept of substantive equality,aimed at protecting persons from arbitrary, unreasonable, malicious andcapricious executive and administrative action.

The case of E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1974 SC 555, fromthe Supreme Court of India, is enlightening in this regard, owing to theformer Chief Justice of India P. N. Bhagwatis exceptional elucidation of theconcept of equality;

Now, what is the content and reach of this great equalizing principle? It is afounding faith, to use the words of Bose J, a way of life, and it must not to besubjectedto a narrowpedanticorlexicographicapproach.We cannotcountenance any attempt to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning, forto do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamicconcept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be cribbed, cabinedand confined within traditional doctrinal limits. From a positivistic point ofview, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrarinessare sworn enemies, one belongs to the rule of law in a republic, while theother, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act isarbitrary, it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logicand Constitutional law and is therefore violative of Article 14.

16

The Article 14 of the Constitution of India which recognizes equality beforethe law is remarkably similar to Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lankaand although it is ex-facie apparent that the latter Article is wider in scopecompared to the former, whereas the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court ofIndiapertinenttopetitionsandappealsclaiminginfringementsoffundamental rights is wider than that of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka,such divergences, as very correctly expounded by Yasantha Kodagoda, PC.,J. in the Judgment of Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority, at p. 18,should notdebarSriLankan justices from where appropriate, takingpersuasive cognizance of Indian jurisprudence relating to the interpretation ofthe substantive legal concepts embodied in the right to equality.

Therefore, after cautious perusal and contemplation of the law, the need forsuch law and the development of the concept of equality as discussed above,I am inclined to align myself with the interpretation that a Petitioner beingdiscriminated against another person who was similarly circumstanced asthe Petitioner is not the sole criterion for successfully pleading a violation ofright to equality, as arbitrary, mala fide and unreasonable executive actionis also seen as being inconsistent with the very concept of equality, therebyinfringing upon the right to equality before the law as guaranteed underArticle 12(1) of the Constitution.

Accordingly, I hold that the decision of the 1st Respondent to depart fromthe already established criteria for internal appointments in the form ofCircular 16/2003 in this instance is arbitrary, mala fide and unreasonable,and thereby violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioners as guaranteedby Article 12(1) of the Constitution.

I will now briefly examine whether the practice of the 1st Respondent ofallocating 30% of vacancies to be filled by those above the age of 50 years,disregarding the written examination and based solely on the interview, andassurances made to the Petitioners by the 1st Respondent and/or itsofficersthatthePetitionersneedonlynominallysitforthewrittenexamination and the results thereon would not be a deciding factor inselection for appointments, gave rise to a legitimate expectation.

In the case of Fernando v. Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. [2006]3 Sri LR 141, Gamini Amaratunga, J. held that;

The existence of a legitimate expectation, as opposed to a legally enforceableright, is a relevant factor in considering the just and equitable relief this Courtmay grant under Article 126 (4) of the Constitution when it is shown that theaction of the executive which frustrates the legitimate expectation amounts to

17

a denial of the right to equal protection of the law guaranteed by theConstitution.

Moreover, Priyantha Jayawardena, PC., J. in the case of Nimalsiri v.Fernando [SC (FR) 256/2010, SC Minutes of 17.09.2015], at p. 8,remarked on the Judgment of Dayaratne v. Minister of Health andIndigenous Medicine [1999] 1 SLR 393 by Justice Amarasinghe, asfollows;

In Dayaratne v. Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine [1999] 1SLR 393, Amarasinghe J, held that destroying of a legitimate expectation is aground for judicial review which amounted to a violation of equal protectionguaranteed by Article 12 of the Constitution.

However,intheaforesaid case, Priyantha Jayawardena, PC., J. afteranalyzing all the relevant facts and circumstances dismissed the saidApplication holding that the Petitioner did not have a legitimate expectationto be enlisted in the Sri Lanka Army for a third time.

Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, J., in the case of Lancelot Perera v. NationalPolice Commission and others [2007] 2 ALR 24, expounded on theconcept of legitimate expectation as follows;

Legitimate expectation, as was stated by me in Anushika Jayatileka andothersv.UniversityGrantsCommission[S.C.(Application)No.280/2001 S.C. Minutes of 25.10.2004] derives from an undertakinggiven by someone in authority and such an undertaking may not even beexpressed and would have to be known from the surrounding circumstances.

Priyantha Jayawardena, PC., J., in the aforesaid Judgment of Nimalsiri v.Fernando, also sheds light on the concept of legitimate expectation;

Thedoctrineoflegitimate expectation applies to situations to protectlegitimate expectation. It arises from establishing an expectation believing anundertakingorpromisegivenbyapublicofficialorestablishinganexpectation taking into consideration of established practices of an authority.However, the said criteria should not be considered as an exhaustive list asthe doctrine of legitimate expectation has a potential to develop further.Legitimate expectation can be either based on procedural propriety or onsubstantive protection.

Therefore, the doctrine of legitimate expectation can be further divided into

two aspects as procedural legitimate expectation and substantive legitimate

expectation. Prasanna Jayawardena, PC., J. citing an extract from Prof. Paul

CraigsbookAdministrativeLaw7thEditioninthecase of M.R.C.C.

Ariyarathne v. N.K. Illangakoon [SC (FR) 444/2012, SC Minutes of

30.07.2019], has explicated on the said two aspects as follows:

The phrase procedural legitimate expectation denotes the existence of some

process right the applicant claims to possess as the result of a promise or

behaviour by the public body that generates the expectation . The phrase

substantive legitimate expectationcaptures the situation in which the

applicant seeks a particular benefit of or commodity, such as a welfare benefit

or a license, as the result of some promise, behaviour or representation made

by the public body.

Moreover, as stated by Priyantha Jayawardena, PC. J., in the Judgment of

Nimalsiri v. Fernando, the applicability of the doctrine of legitimate

expectation depends on the facts and circumstances of each case;

In order to seek redress under the doctrine of legitimate expectation a person

should prove he had a legitimate expectation which was based on a promise

or an established practice. Thus, the applicability of the said doctrine is based

on the facts and circumstances of each case.

In the instant Application, the Petitioners argue that they had a procedural

legitimate expectation based on the established procedure and practice of

the 1st Respondent of allocating 30% of vacancies in internal appointments

to be filled by those above the age of 50 years disregarding the written

examination and based solely on the interview, as borne out by the Circular

16/2003. The Petitioners also argue that they had a substantive legitimate

expectation in light of the substantive benefit of 30% of vacancies being set

aside for such a method of internal appointments for those over 50 years of

age in conformity with the same Circular.

The case of Lancelot Perera v. National Police Commission and others

is important in this regard, where the Petitioner, a Senior Superintendent of

Police, successfully claimed that the decision of the Respondents to not

appoint him to the post of Deputy Inspector General of Police after being

19

called for interviews and being placed third in order of merit out of 52

candidates, amounted to a violation of his fundamental rights as guaranteed

by Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Although the Police Commission had

arbitrary decided not to allow the Petitioner to apply for further promotions,

the Respondents had later decided to depart from the said position and

directedthePetitionertoattendthesaidinterview.Accordingly,the

Petitioner claimed that the decision to call him for the said interview gave

rise to a legitimate expectation on his behalf that he would be promoted to

the post of Deputy Inspector General of Police if he becomes successful at

the interview. Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, J., after a thorough analysis of

the interconnection between substantive legitimate expectations and the

right to equality, held that;

Considering all the circumstances, it is apparent that the application for the

promotion and the invitation to attend the interview and by its successful

completion the petitioner had a legitimate expectation that he would be

promoted to the rank of Deputy Inspector General of Police.

Circular16/2003isunambiguousinrespectofsuchpracticeand

procedure, that 30% of vacancies will be allocated to applicants over 50

years of age who are excused from sitting for the written examination. The

RespondentsthemselveshaveadmittedintheirAffidavitandwritten

submissions that the past practice of the 1st Respondent was to have 30%

of vacancies set aside in internal appointments for those over 50 years of

age and to select such applications solely based on the interview process in

accordance with the said Circular. I have already held that Circular

16/2003 is still in force, and has been in force throughout the concerned

period and remains as the applicable Scheme of Recruitment in respect of

the Petitioners.

Further, the officers of the management of the 1st Respondent have given

assurances to the Petitioners that they need only nominally sit for the

written examination and the results of the said examination would not be a

deciding factor in their selection for appointments to the posts of Assistant

20

Security Officer. The said assurances can be construed as a promise made

by the 1st Respondent to the effect that the established practice would be

followed in the situation at hand as well and 30% of the vacancies would be

allocated for the said method of appointment.

Moreover, the relevant applications issued to all the Petitioners, with the

exception of the 5th Petitioner, contained the option to indicate whether they

opt to sit for a written examination or not and they have all opted not to sit

for such written examination. Subsequently, the duly completed application

forms of Petitioners have been accepted by the 1st Respondent. Further, the

1st Respondent has neither informed the Petitioners nor brought to their

attention that the said Circular is no longer in force and a change of policy

has taken place until proceedings were instituted before this Court.

Therefore,aftercarefulperusaloftheaforementionedfactsand

circumstances, I am inclined to hold that the Petitioners had justifiable

reasons to form a legitimate expectation, both in terms of a procedural

legitimateexpectationand substantive legitimate expectation, that the

established procedure and practice of allocating 30% of available vacancies

to the said method of appointment would be followed by the 1st Respondent.

As such, a legitimate expectation was in fact accrued to the Petitioners to

such extent, which was subsequently violated by the Respondents owing to

their failure to follow the established procedure for internal appointments

for those over 50 years of age and allocate the said percentage of 30% of

vacancies to such method of appointment, in accordance with the Circular

16/2003.

infringement of right to equality as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the

Constitution,inthecircumstances,Iamoftheopinionthatthe

fundamental rights of the Petitioners guaranteed under Article 12(1) have

been violated by the 1st Respondent.

21

Having examined the facts of the case and material placed before this Court,

I allow the Application of the Petitioners and hold that their fundamental

rights as guaranteed by Article 12(1) have been infringed upon by the acts of

the 1st Respondent, owing to the arbitrary, capricious and irrational manner

in which the Petitioners were deprived of their appointments to the rank of

Assistant Security Officer, in contravention of established procedures and

assurances of the 1st Respondent.

Therefore, in accordance with the powers vested in this Court to make an

appropriate, just, and equitable order under Article 126 of the Constitution

when an aggrieved party establishes a violation of their fundamental rights

guaranteed under the Constitution, and in consideration of the fact that the

Petitioners have now retired from service, I direct the 1st Respondent to

backdate the promotions of the Petitioners to the post of Assistant Security

Officers with effect from 10.09.2014.

The 1st Respondent is further directed to pay back wages up until the date

of retirement to each Petitioner.
