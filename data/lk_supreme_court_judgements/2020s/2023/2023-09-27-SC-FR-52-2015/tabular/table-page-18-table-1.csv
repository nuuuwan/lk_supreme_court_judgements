"“In Dayaratne v. Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine [1999] 1"
"SLR 393, Amarasinghe J, held that destroying of a legitimate expectation is a"
"ground for
judicial
review which amounted to a violation of equal protection"
"guaranteed by Article 12 of the Constitution.”"
"However,

Priyantha

in authority and such an undertaking may not even be"
"expressed and would have to be known from the surrounding circumstances."
"Priyantha Jayawardena, PC., J.,
in the aforesaid Judgment of Nimalsiri v."
"Fernando, also sheds light on the concept of legitimate expectation;"
"“The
doctrine
of
legitimate
expectation
applies
to
situations
to
protect"
"legitimate expectation.
It arises from establishing an expectation believing an"
"undertaking
or
promise
given
by
a
public
official
or
establishing
an"
"expectation taking into consideration of established practices of an authority."
"However,
the said criteria should not be considered as an exhaustive list as"
"the
doctrine
of
legitimate
expectation
has
a
potential
to develop
further."
"Legitimate
expectation can be
either
based on procedural
propriety or
on"
"substantive protection.”"
"Therefore,
the doctrine of
legitimate expectation can be further divided into"
"two aspects as procedural
legitimate expectation and substantive legitimate"
