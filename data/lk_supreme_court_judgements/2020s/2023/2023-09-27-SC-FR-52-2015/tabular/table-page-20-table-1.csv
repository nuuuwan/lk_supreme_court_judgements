"called
for
interviews
and
being placed third in order
of merit
out
of 52"
"candidates, amounted to a violation of his fundamental rights as guaranteed"
"by Article 12(1) of
the Constitution. Although the Police Commission had"
"arbitrary decided not
to allow the Petitioner to apply for further promotions,"
"the Respondents had later decided to depart
from the
said position and"
"directed
the
Petitioner
to
attend
the
said
interview.
Accordingly,
the"
"Petitioner claimed that
the decision to call him for
the said interview gave"
"rise to a legitimate expectation on his behalf
that he would be promoted to"
"the post of Deputy Inspector General of Police if he becomes successful at"
"the interview. Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, J., after a thorough analysis of"
"the
interconnection between substantive
legitimate
expectations
and the"
"right to equality, held that;"
"“Considering all
the circumstances,
it
is apparent
that
the application for the"
"promotion and the
invitation to attend the
interview and by its successful"
"completion
the
petitioner
had
a
legitimate
expectation
that
he would be"
"promoted to the rank of Deputy Inspector General of Police.”"
"Circular
16/2003
is
unambiguous
in
respect
of
such
practice
and"
"procedure,
that 30% of
vacancies will be allocated to applicants over 50"
"years of age who are excused from sitting for
the written examination. The"
"Respondents
themselves
have
admitted
in
their
Affidavit
and
written"
"submissions that
the past practice of
the 1st Respondent was to have 30%"
"of vacancies set aside in internal appointments for
those over 50 years of"
"age and to select such applications solely based on the interview process in"
"accordance with
the
said
Circular.
I
have
already
held
that
Circular"
"16/2003 is still
in force, and has been in force throughout
the concerned"
"period and remains as the applicable Scheme of Recruitment
in respect of"
"the Petitioners."
"Further,
the officers of
the management of
the 1st Respondent have given"
"assurances
to
the
Petitioners
that
they need
only nominally
sit
for
the"
"written examination and the results of
the said examination would not be a"
"deciding factor
in their selection for appointments to the posts of Assistant"
