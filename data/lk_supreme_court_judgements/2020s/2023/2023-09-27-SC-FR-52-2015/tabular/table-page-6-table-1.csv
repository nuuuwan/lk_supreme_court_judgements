"He further stated that
the Petitioners secured 27.94, 33.91, 24.60, 29.33,"
"and
31.62 marks
respectively,
at
the written
examination
and
the
1st"
"Petitioner was in fact unsuccessful at the said written examination."
"The Chairman of
the 1st Respondent also stated that
the relevant notice"
"calling applications for
the positions of Assistant Security Officers filed by"
"the Petitioners is incomplete as it contains only two pages as opposed to the"
"actual notice which contained three pages. Therefore,
the Petitioners have"
"deliberately/mistakenly left out
the actual page two of the said notice which"
"discloses the necessity to sit
for a written examination. He further claimed"
"that pages of
the said notice have not been numbered properly as both the"
"second and third pages of the said notice have been numbered as page 2."
"Moreover, he stated that
the said notice was published on 11.02.2013 and"
"the Petitioners cannot now claim that they were unaware of the requirement"
"to
sit
for a written examination, and if
they were aggrieved by
the
said"
"requirement,
they
could have
taken appropriate measures soon after. He"
"further stated that
the 3rd Petitioner was informed of
the requirement
to sit"
"for
a
written
examination,
to
which
all
the
Petitioners
subsequently"
"complied."
"He has denied the remaining averments which are inconsistent with what is"
"stated
above
and
stated
that
the
Respondents
have
not
violated"
"fundamental
rights
of
the Petitioners,
they are not entitled to any of
the"
"reliefs sought and the Application should accordingly be dismissed."
"The
Petitioners
in
their
Counter
Objections
stated
that
the
letter
of"
"appointment of
the 3rd Respondent had been issued after
the filing of
the"
"instant Application and the said letter of appointment, in any event, affected"
"his
seniority
since others similarly circumstanced as the Petitioners have"
"been
so
appointed with
effect
from at
least
10.09.2014.
Further,
the"
"Petitioners
stated that
the notice
they have
submitted to Court was
the"
"notice that was available to them at
the time of
filing this Application. As"
"such,
the notice calling for applications submitted by the Chairman of
the"
"1st
Respondent
in
his
Affidavit, marked
2R2, was
not
the
document"
"available to the them. Moreover,
the Petitioners claimed that the application"
"forms that
they submitted were in fact accepted by the 1st Respondent and"
"they were never
informed of any defect when the
said applications were"
"accepted."
"The Petitioners stated that
the Respondents acted contrary to the disclosed"
"criteria in Circular 16/2003 and have failed to disclose any change in such"
"criteria. Therefore, such criteria are still
in force and as such, 2R2 is void ab"
"initio."
