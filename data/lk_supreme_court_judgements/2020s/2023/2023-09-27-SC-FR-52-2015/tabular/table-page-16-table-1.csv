"This position was further strengthened by the recent Judgment
in the case"
"of Wijerathna
v.
Sri
Lanka
Ports
Authority
[SC
(FR)
256/17,
SC"
"Minutes of 11.12.2020], where Yasantha Kodagoda, PC., J. held that;"
"“It
is now well accepted that,
the ‘right
to equality’ covers a much wider area,"
"aimed at preventing other ‘injustices’ too, that are recognized by law. Equality"
"is now a right as opposed to a mere privilege or an entitlement, and in the"
"context of Sri Lanka a ‘Fundamental Right’,
conferred on the people by the"
"Constitution,
for
the
purpose
of
curing
not
only
injustices
taking
the"
"manifestation of discrimination, but a host of other maladies recognized by"
"law.”"
"At p. 17 of
the
said Judgment, His Lordship further elaborated that
the"
"Court has since moved on from the decision of Perera v. Jayawickrema"
"towards a more progressive definition of the concept of equality;"
"“Of
course,
since
the
pronouncement
of
the majority judgment
in Elmore"
"Perera
v.
Major
Montague
Jayawickrema,
Minister
of
Public"
"Administration
and
Plantation
Industries
and Others,
the Supreme"
"Court
of Sri Lanka has
somewhat distanced itself
from the interpretations"
"provided by Chief Justice S. Sharvananda to the concepts of
‘equality’ and"
"‘discrimination’, and provided an expansive and more progressive definition of"
"the concept of equality,
founded upon the concept of
‘substantive equality’,"
"aimed
at
protecting
persons
from arbitrary, unreasonable, malicious and"
"capricious executive and administrative action.”"
"The case of E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu, AIR 1974 SC 555,
from"
"the Supreme Court
of
India,
is
enlightening
in this
regard, owing to the"
"former Chief Justice of
India P. N. Bhagwati’s exceptional elucidation of
the"
"concept of equality;"
"“Now, what
is the content and reach of
this great equalizing principle? It
is a"
"founding faith, to use the words of Bose J,
‘a way of life’, and it must not to be"
"subjected
to
a
narrow pedantic
or
lexicographic
approach. We
cannot"
"countenance any attempt
to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning, for"
"to do
so would be
to
violate
its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic"
"concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be cribbed, cabined"
"and confined within traditional doctrinal
limits. From a positivistic point of"
"view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness.
In fact, equality and arbitrariness"
"are sworn enemies, one belongs to the rule of
law in a republic, while the"
"other,
to
the whim and caprice
of an absolute monarch. Where an act
is"
"arbitrary,
it
is implicit
in it
that
it
is unequal both according to political
logic"
"and Constitutional
law and is therefore violative of Article 14.”"
