"qualifications that
is necessary for a particular position, would it be possible"
"for him to obtain relief
in terms of a violation of his fundamental rights on the"
"basis of unequal treatment? If the answer to this question is in the affirmative,"
"it would mean that Article 12(1) of
the Constitution would be applicable even"
"in a situation where there is no violation of
the applicable legal procedure or"
"the general practice. The application of Article 12(1) of the Constitution cannot"
"be used for such situations as it provides to an aggrieved person only for the"
"equal
protection
of
the
law where
the authorities have acted illegally
or"
"incorrectly without
giving
due
consideration
to
the
applicable
guidelines."
"Article 12(1) of
the Constitution does not provide for any situation where the"
"authorities will have to act
illegally. The safeguard retained in Article 12(1)
is"
"for
the performance
of a lawful act and not
to be directed to carry out an"
"illegal
function. In order to succeed the petitioner must be in a position to place"
"material before this Court
that
there has been unequal
treatment within the"
"framework of a lawful act.”"
"In
the
case
of
Thilak
Lalitha
Kumara
v.
S.S.
Hewapathirana,"
"Secretary, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Skills Development
[SC (FR)"
"451/2011, SC Minutes of 17.09.2015], Anil Gooneratne, J. dismissing an"
"application claiming
a
violation of
fundamental
rights
as
guaranteed by"
"Article 12(1), also held that;"
"“To survive equal protection attack the different
treatment of
two classes of"
"persons must be justified by a relevant difference between them.”"
"Similarly,
in the case of Wasantha Disanayake and others v. Secretary,"
"Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs and others (SC"
"(FR) 611/2012, SC Minutes of 10.09.2015), K. Sripavan, CJ. held that
it"
"is necessary to show unequal
treatment and discriminatory action against"
"the Petitioners in pleading a violation of right to equality;"
"“Article 12(1) of
the Constitution contemplates the right
to equality and states"
"that,
‘All
persons are
equal
before
the
law and are
entitled to
the
equal"
"protection of
the law’. What
is meant here is that equals should be treated"
"equally and similar laws and regulations should be applicable to persons who"
"are similarly circumstanced.
In reference to Article 12(1) of
the Constitution, it"
"would be necessary to
show that
there had been unequal
treatment, and"
"therefore, there exist discriminatory action against the Petitioners.”"
