"“This Article is violated both by unequal
treatment of
the equals and equal"
"treatment of
the unequals. The aim of
the article is to ensure that
invidious"
"distinction or arbitrary discrimination shall not be made by the State between"
"a citizen and a citizen who answers the same though the concept of equality"
"does not
involve the idea of absolute equality among human beings. Hence,"
"equality before the law does not mean that things which are different shall be"
"treated as they were the same. Thus,
the principle of equality enacted under"
"Article 12 does not absolutely prevent
the State from differentiating between"
"persons
and
things.
The
State
has
the
power
of what
is
known
an"
"''classification''
on a basis
of
rational distinction relevant
to
the particular"
"subject dealt with. So
long as all persons
failing into
the
same
class are"
"treated alike there is no question of discrimination and there is no question of"
"violating
the
equality
clause.
The
discrimination which
is
prohibited
is"
"treatment
in a manner prejudicial as compared to another person in similar"
"circumstances. Discrimination is
the
essence
of
classification; so long as it"
"rests on a reasonable basis there is no violation of
the constitutional rights of"
"equality.”"
"However,
the
latter
view taken
up
by
the
Petitioners was
endorsed
by"
"Wimalaratne, J., who delivered a dissenting opinion in the same case:"
"“In order
to establish discrimination,
it
is not necessary for
the Petitioner
to"
"show that correct procedure was applied in the case of others and that he has"
"been singled out
for the adoption of a different procedure. Nor is it necessary"
"for him to
show that no
others were
victims
of
the wrong procedure now"
"applied for the first time, perhaps in his case.”"
"An
identical
stance
to
that
of
the
Respondents
was
followed
by"
"Sharvananda, CJ.
in the case of C.W. Mackie and Company Ltd. v. Hugh"
"Molagoda, Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and others [1986]"
"1 SLR 300, where His Lordship held that;"
"“In order to sustain the plea of discrimination based upon Article 12(1) a party"
"will have to satisfy the court about
two things, namely (1)
that he has been"
"treated differently from others, and (2)
that he has been differently treated"
"from persons similarly circumstanced without any reasonable basis.”"
"The requirement of proving unequal
treatment was further emphasized by"
"Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, J.,
in the
case
of Farook v. Dharmaratne,"
"Chairman, Provincial Public Service Commission and others [2005] 1"
"Sri LR 133, as follows;"
"“….
the petitioner quite
clearly has
sought
to
obtain relief
on the basis of"
"unequal
treatment.
When
a
person
does
not
possess
the
required"
