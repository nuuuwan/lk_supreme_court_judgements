"Security Officer. The said assurances can be construed as a promise made"
"by the 1st Respondent
to the effect
that
the established practice would be"
"followed in the situation at hand as well and 30% of the vacancies would be"
"allocated for the said method of appointment."
"Moreover,
the
relevant applications
issued to all
the Petitioners, with the"
"exception of
the 5th Petitioner, contained the option to indicate whether they"
"opt
to sit
for a written examination or not and they have all opted not to sit"
"for such written examination. Subsequently,
the duly completed application"
"forms of Petitioners have been accepted by the 1st Respondent. Further, the"
"1st Respondent has neither
informed the Petitioners nor brought
to their"
"attention that
the said Circular is no longer in force and a change of policy"
"has taken place until proceedings were instituted before this Court."
"Therefore,
after
careful
perusal
of
the
aforementioned
facts
and"
"circumstances,
I
am inclined to hold that
the Petitioners had justifiable"
"reasons
to
form a
legitimate
expectation, both in terms
of a procedural"
"legitimate
expectation
and
substantive
legitimate
expectation,
that
the"
"established procedure and practice of allocating 30% of available vacancies"
"to the said method of appointment would be followed by the 1st Respondent."
"As such, a legitimate expectation was in fact accrued to the Petitioners to"
"such extent, which was subsequently violated by the Respondents owing to"
"their
failure to follow the established procedure for
internal appointments"
"for
those over 50 years of age and allocate the said percentage of 30% of"
"vacancies to such method of appointment,
in accordance with the Circular"
"16/2003."
"Since
it
is
established
as
aforesaid
that
destroying
of
a
legitimate"
"expectation
is
a
ground
for
judicial
review
which
amounted
to
an"
"infringement
of
right
to
equality
as
guaranteed
by
Article
12(1)
of
the"
"Constitution,
in
the
circumstances,
I
am
of
the
opinion
that
the"
"fundamental
rights of
the Petitioners guaranteed under Article 12(1) have"
"been violated by the 1st Respondent."
