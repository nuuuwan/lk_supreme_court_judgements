challenging
the
purported
new
Scheme
of"
"Recruitment, marked 2R2,
introduced on 11.02.2013."
"This Court has time and again held that
the time limit stipulated in Article"
"126(2)
is a mandatory requirement."
"In the
case
of Demuni Sriyani de Zoysa and others
v. Dharmasena"
"Dissanayake
and
others
[SC
(FR)
206/2008,
SC
Minutes
of"
"09.12.2016], Prasanna Jayawardena, PC., J. observed that;"
"“The
rule
that, an application under Article 126 which has not been filed"
"within one month of
the occurrence of
the alleged infringement will make that"
"application unmaintainable, has been enunciated time and again from the"
"time this Court exercised the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction conferred upon"
"it by the 1978 Constitution. Thus,
in EDIRISURIYA Vs. NAVARATNAM [1985"
"1 SLR 100 at p.105- 106], Ranasinghe J, as he then was, stated “This"
"Court has consistently proceeded on the basis that the time limit of one month"
"set out in Article 126 (2) of the Constitution is mandatory.”."
"In the above case,
the Petitioners contended that
failure of the Respondents"
"to allocate marks in the selection process for Class II Grade II of
the Sri"
"Lanka Administrative Service
for
the
period
the
Petitioners
served
on a"
"supernumerary basis in the ‘Supra Class’ of the General Clerical Service and"
""
"in the Public Management Assistants’ Service, amounted to a"
"violation of
their
fundamental
rights as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of
the"
"Constitution.
The
said
selection
process was
based
on
the
Combined"
"Services Circular No. 01/2007 issued on 05.02.2007 by the Secretary of the"
"Ministry
of
Public Administration and Home Affairs. The Petitioners had"
"been well
aware
that
in terms
of
the
said Circular
they would not
be"
"allocated marks for their period of service on a supernumerary basis. Since"
"the Petition was filed on 05.06.2008, 16 months after the said Circular was"
"issued,
the Respondents contended that
the Application of
the Petitioners"
"was
time
barred.
Prasanna
Jayawardena,
PC.,
J.,
upholding
the
said"
"preliminary objection, elucidated that;"
"“Therefore,
it
is clear
that,
the alleged infringement occurred on or soon after"
"05th February 2007 when the Circular marked “P9” was issued and made"
"known to the Petitioners.”’"
"Therefore,
it was held in the above case that;"
"“The Petition has been filed on 05th June 2008 which is more than 16 months"
"after
the
day
the
Petitioners
themselves
state
the
alleged
infringement"
"occurred. Therefore,
the Petition is
time barred and liable to be dismissed"
