"Ariyarathne
v. N.K.
Illangakoon [SC (FR) 444/2012, SC Minutes of"
"30.07.2019], has explicated on the said two aspects as follows:"
"“The phrase ‘procedural
legitimate expectation’ denotes the existence of some"
"process
right
the applicant
claims to possess as the result of a promise or"
"behaviour by the public body that generates the expectation …. The phrase"
"‘substantive
legitimate
expectation’
captures
the
situation
in which
the"
"applicant seeks a particular benefit of or commodity, such as a welfare benefit"

"16/2003. The Petitioners also argue that
they had a substantive legitimate"
"expectation in light of
the substantive benefit of 30% of vacancies being set"
"aside for such a method of
internal appointments for those over 50 years of"
"age in conformity with the same Circular."
"The case of Lancelot Perera v. National Police Commission and others"
"is important
in this regard, where the Petitioner, a Senior Superintendent of"
