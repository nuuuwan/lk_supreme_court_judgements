"V. S.S.K. Aviruppola, Principal, Visakha Vidyalaya and others [S.C."
"F.R. No. 117/2011] held that;"
"“As
referred to above in this judgment,
the Petitioners have failed to place"
"before this court any material
to establish that
they were treated differently"
"by any of
the above Respondents when they decide not
to admit
the 3rd"
"Petitioner
to
Dharmashoka
Vidyalaya,
Ambalangoda.
In
the
said"
"circumstances I hold that Petitioners have not been successful
in establishing"
"that
their
fundamental
rights guaranteed in terms
of Article 12 (1)
of
the"
"Constitution had been violated by the Respondents.”"
"However,
the latter view taken up by the Petitioners with regards to right to"
"equality
is
supported
by
the
case
of
Jayasinghe
v. Attorney General"
"[1994] 2 SLR 74, where Mark Fernando, J.
took the view that
the Court"
"must
take judicial notice in instances where the fundamental requirements"
"of
justice and fair play were not
followed.
It was further stated in the same"
"case
by Mark Fernando,
J.
that
the Full Bench decision in the
case
of"
"Perera
v.
Jayawickrama
is
doubtful
as
to
laying
down
an
inflexible"
"principle of universal application and that
the facts of each case must be"
"considered in perusing a violation of Article 12(1):"
"“I doubt whether that decision must be regarded as laying down an inflexible"
"principle of universal application: the facts of each case must be considered. If"
"an employee alleges a denial of equal protection because he was compelled to"
"participate in a disciplinary inquiry without ever being told what
the charges"
"against him were, would a Court demand evidence to prove at least one other"
"contrary
instance?
I
think
not.
The Court must
take
judicial notice,
that"
"ordinarily - and not merely in a few instances - charges are disclosed prior to"
"inquiry.”"
"Further,
in the case of Wickremasinghe v. Ceylon Petroleum Corporation"
"[2001]
2
SLR 409, while
holding
that
a
decision
of
the Respondent"
"Corporation to terminate the dealership of
the Petitioner
is violative of his"
"right
to equality guaranteed under Article 12(1) of
the Constitution, Sarath"
"N. Silva, CJ. took the view that;"
"“The case of Perera v. Jayawickrema demonstrates the ineffectiveness of"
"the guarantee in Article 12(1) which results from the rigid application of
the"
"requirement
to prove that persons similarly circumstanced as the Petitioner"
"were differently treated. Such an application of
the guarantee under Article"
"12(1)
ignores
the
essence
of
the
basic
standard which
is
to
ensure"
"reasonableness as
opposed to arbitrariness in the manner
required by the"
"basic standard.”"
