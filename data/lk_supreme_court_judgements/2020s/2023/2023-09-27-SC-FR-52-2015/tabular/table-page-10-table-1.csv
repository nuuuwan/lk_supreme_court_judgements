"“… the time limit of one month prescribed by Article 126 of the Constitution to"
"invoke
the
fundamental
rights
jurisdiction
for
an
alleged
violation
is"
"mandatory.
In a fit case, however, an application made outside the time limit"
"of one month stipulated in Article 126 could be entertained where the delay"
"had resulted due to a reason or reasons as the case may be that are beyond"
"the
control
of
the
Petitioner
or where
the
court
is
satisfied
that
the"
"circumstances prevailed at
the time relevant,
it would have been impossible"
"for
the Petitioner
to have invoked the jurisdiction within 30 days and to be"
"more
precise where
the
Principle
lex non cogit ad impossibllia would be"
"applicable.”"
"The contention of
the Respondents in this case is that
the Petitioners have"
"preferred
this Application on 06.03.2015
challenging
the purported new"
"Scheme
of
Recruitment
introduced
on
11.02.2013,
and
as
such
this"
"Application is time barred. Further,
the Respondents have also submitted"
"that
the Petitioners have failed to establish that the reason they were unable"
"to comply with the said time limit requirement as stipulated in Article 126(2)"
"was
due
to
circumstances
beyond
their
control
and
therefore,
this"
"Application should be dismissed."
"However,
the Petitioners claim that Circular No. 16/2003 is still
in force and"
"a valid rule within the Authority. As such,
it must be followed until such"
"time it
is duly changed.
It
is their submission that
the document marked"
"2R2, which the Respondents state as being the new Scheme of Recruitment,"
"is an internal notice calling for applications and therefore,
it does not have"
"the
power
of
overruling
a Circular
issued
by
the Chairman of
the
1st"
"Respondent."
"Since the success of
the preliminary objection taken by the Respondents is"
"contingent on the submission that a change of rule has taken place in view"
"of
the document marked 2R2,
I will
firstly move to consider the contentions"
"of parties pertaining to the presently applicable Scheme of Recruitment
in"
"respect of the Petitioners."
"In examining the material placed before this Court,
it
is apparent
that
the"
"document marked 2R2 is not numbered properly.
Although the first page"
"has been numbered correctly as page 1, both the second and third pages"
"have been numbered as page 2. This was also accepted as such by the"
"Respondents themselves. Further, the application forms received by four out"
"of
the five Petitioners, with the sole exception of the 5th Petitioner, contained"
"the option to indicate their preference as to whether
they are willing to sit"
"for
the written examination or not. Thus, as pleaded by the Petitioners, an"
"80% of application forms
in the given instance can be deduced as being"
"based on Circular 16/2003."
