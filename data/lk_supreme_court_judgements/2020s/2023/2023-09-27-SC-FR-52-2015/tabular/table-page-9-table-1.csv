"unless the Petitioners can seek an extension of
the time limit on grounds that,"
"they were prevented from filing the Petition earlier.”"
"The case of Dayaratne and others v. National Savings Bank [2002] 3"
"SLR 116
is
also
important
in
this
regard, where Mark
Fernando,
J."
"observed that;"
"“The first
limb of
the respondents’ preliminary objection is that after the lapse"
"of
one month the petitioners were not
entitled to
challenge
the
scheme
of"
"promotion. The 1st
respondent was
entitled,
from time to time, and in the"
"interests of
the institution,
to lay down the basis on which employees would"
"be promoted, and that became part of the contract of employment. The scheme"
"of
promotion
published
on
12.02.2001 was
directly
and
immediately"
"applicable to the petitioners, and became part of
the terms and conditions of"
"their employment.
If
they did not consent
to those terms and conditions, as"
"being violative of
their rights under Article 12, they should have complained to"
"this Court within one month. They failed to do so. Instead, they acquiesced in"
"those terms and conditions by applying for promotion without any protest.
I,"
"therefore, uphold the objection.”"
"However,
as held
by Mark Fernando,
J.
in the
case
of Gamaethige
v."
"Siriwardena [1988] 1 SLR 344,
that
in exceptional
circumstances
this"
"Court has
the discretion to entertain an application not made within the"
"stipulated time limit."
"“While the time limit
is mandatory,
in exceptional cases on the application of"
"the principle lex non cogit ad impossibilia, if there is no lapse, fault or delay on"
"the
part
of
the
petitioner,
this
Court
has
a
discretion
to
entertain
an"
"application made out of time.”"
"A similar view was enunciated by Aluwihare, PC., J.
in the case of K.H.G."
"Kithsiri v. Hon. Faizer Musthapha MP, Minister of Provincial Councils"
"and Local Government and others [SC (FR) 362/2017, SC Minutes of"
"10.01.2018], as well."
"“This court, however,
in exceptional circumstances where the Petitioner was"
"prevented, by reason beyond his control,
from taking measures which would"
"enable the filing of a Petition within one month of the alleged infringement and"
"if
there had been no
lapse
on the part
of
the Petitioner, has exercised its"
"discretion
in
entertaining
fundamental
rights
applications
and
had
not"
"hesitated to apply the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia.”"
"Aluwihare, PC., J. further went onto state in the same case that;"
