"Although it
is submitted by the Respondents that
the said Circular
is no"
"longer
in force,
the duly completed said application forms of
the Petitioners"
"were in fact accepted by officers of the 1st Respondent. The Chairman of the"
"1st Respondent stated in his Affidavit
that
it had been an inadvertence on"
"part
of
the
officers who
accepted
the
duly
filled
application forms. The"
"Petitioners state that
thereafter,
the officers of
the management of
the 1st"
"Respondent have
given assurances to the Petitioners that
they need only"
"nominally sit
for the said written examination. Further,
the Petitioners were"
"never
informed of
the purported change in the said Scheme of Recruitment"
"until this matter was brought before this Court."
"Moreover,
the
document marked 2R2, which the Respondents
claim as"
"being the presently applicable Scheme of Recruitment
is a notice calling for"
"applications
signed
by
the Chief Human Resource Manager
of
the
1st"
"Respondent as opposed to Circular 16/2003, which is signed by the then"
"Chairman of the 1st Respondent."
"Section 17(1)(a)
of
the
Interpretation Ordinance of Sri Lanka, which I"
"find
as
directly
applicable
and
conclusive
in
this
regard,
provides
the"
"procedure for changing of rules as follows;"
"(1) Where
any
enactment,
whether
passed
before
or
after
the"
"commencement
of
this Ordinance,
confers power on any authority to"
"make rules,
the following provisions shall, unless the contrary intention"
"appears, have effect with reference to the making and operation of such"
"rules: -"
"(a) any rule may be amended, varied,
rescinded, or
revoked by"
"the
same authority in the same manner by and in which it"
"was made;"
"Section
7(1)(e)
of
the
Sri
Lanka
Ports Authority Act
grants
the
1st"
"Respondent
the power to “make rules in relation to the officers and servants"
"of
the Authority”,
including,
inter alia,
their appointments and promotions."
"Section 9 of
the
same Act holds
the Chairman of
the Sri Lanka Ports"
"Authority as being responsible for
the administration of
the affairs of
the"
"said Authority."
"Thus,
I am of
the opinion that Circular 16/2003, as a rule applicable to"
"internal appointments
issued in accordance with the aforesaid provisions"
"will cease to have force, only if another Circular
to that effect
is issued by"
"the Chairman of
the said Authority himself,
in light of Section 7(1)(e) and"
"Section 9 of
the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act read together with Section"
"17(1)(a) of the Interpretation Ordinance of Sri Lanka."
