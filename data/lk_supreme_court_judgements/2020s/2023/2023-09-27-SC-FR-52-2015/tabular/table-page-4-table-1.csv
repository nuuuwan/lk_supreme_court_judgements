"The Petitioners have become aware of an internal notice dated 11.02.2013"
"calling
applications
for
appointments
of Assistant Security Officers, and"
"have
submitted the duly
completed application forms as required, which"
"have been then accepted by the 1st Respondent. The requisite application"
"form at clause 11 specifically provided for applicants who were 50 years and"
"above,
to notify
the 1st Respondent whether
they would opt
to
sit
for a"
"written examination or not,
to which all
the Petitioners in their
respective"
"application
forms
opted
not
to
face
such
written
examination.
The"
"Petitioners state that
the accepted practice at
the 1st Respondent has been"
"to permit applicants who are over 50 years of age who apply for
internal"
"appointments,
to
forego
a written
examination
and
have
their
internal"
"appointments based solely on the interview process. They further state that"
"approximately
30% of
vacancies
are,
as
a
practice,
set
aside
for
such"
"method of
internal appointments. The Petitioners have later found out
that"
"such established practice is based on Circular 16/2003 dated 28.05.2002."
"However,
the Petitioners state that
they were asked by the officers of
the"
"management
of
the 1st Respondent
to nominally
sit
for
the
said written"
"examination, with the assurance that
their appointments would be solely"
"based on their performances at
the interview. Accordingly,
the Petitioners"
"have
nominally
sat
for
the
said
written
examination
on
or
around"
"13.03.2014 on the
said verbal assurance
that
their performances at
the"
"written examination would not be a deciding factor in being chosen for the"
"appointments."
"The results of
the said written examination were released in or around July"
"2014,
according
to which
the
Petitioners
have
obtained
average marks"
"between 50 to 62, as against the pass mark of 40. Soon after, the Petitioners"
"except
the
1st
Petitioner
have
been summoned
for
interviews.
The
said"
"Petitioners
have
attended
the
said
interview and
later,
on
or
around"
"22.09.2014,
they have become aware that approximately 46 individuals, a"
"majority
of whom are
junior
to
the Petitioners, have been appointed as"
"Assistant
Security Officers
based
on
their
performances
at
the written"
"examination and interview. However, none of
the Petitioners were included"
"amongst
the
said
appointments.
Thereafter,
the
Petitioners
have made"
"several representations to the management of
the 1st Respondent enquiring"
"as to the prospects of their appointments to the said position, to no avail."
"The
Petitioners
state
that
the
assurances made
to
them by
the
1st"
"Respondent and/or
its officers that
the Petitioners need only nominally sit"
"for the written examination, and the results thereon would not be a deciding"
"factor
in being appointed to the rank of Assistant Security Officer gave rise"
"to a legitimate expectation that
they would be considered for appointments"
