"to the said positions, as the verbal assurances made to that effect were clear"
"and unambiguous which were
reasonable
for
the Petitioners
to
rely
on."
"Moreover,
they claim that
the conduct and established practice of
the said"
"1st Respondent of allocating 30% of vacancies to be filled by those above the"
"age of 50 years, disregarding the written examination and based solely on"
"the interview further engendered in them a legitimate expectation that such"
"established practice would be followed in respect of
the appointments of the"
"Petitioners as well."
"In the
circumstances,
the Petitioners plead that
their
fundamental
rights"
"guaranteed under Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of
the Constitution have"
"been violated
by
the Respondents
for
the
reasons
of
acting
contrary
to"
"publicly
disclosed
criteria
as
stipulated
in
Circular
16/2003
and"
"established practice pertaining to appointments of persons above 50 years of"
"age,
failing
to disclose the number of vacancies for
the rank of Assistant"
"Security Officer and such being done for a collateral purpose, appointing"
"officers
junior
to
the Petitioners
to positions
senior
to
the Petitioners
in"
"violation of published criteria and established practice, and in breach of the"
"principles of natural
justice and legitimate expectations of the Petitioners."
"Accordingly,
this Court granted leave to proceed for the alleged infringement"
"of
fundamental rights of
the Petitioners as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the"
"Constitution."
"Thereafter,
the Chairman of
the
1st Respondent
filed an affidavit dated"
"26.11.2015 and stated,
inter alia, that the 3rd Petitioner was promoted to the"
"post
of
Assistant
Security
Officer
on
08.09.2015
with
effect
from"
"03.26.2015. He further stated that
the application forms issued to some of"
"the Petitioners, with the exception of
the 5th Petitioner who had filled the"
"correct application form, contained the option to indicate whether they opt"
"to sit
for a written examination or not. Such application forms were in fact"
"old
application
forms,
prepared
based
on
the
previous
Scheme
of"
"Recruitment which was in place prior to the establishment of
the presently"
"applicable
Scheme
of
Recruitment.
Thus,
he
contended
that
Circular"
"16/2003 is no longer
in force,
in view of
the notice calling for applications"
"dated 11.02.2013, which is the presently applicable Scheme of Recruitment."
"The said notice calling for applications contains the requirement
to sit
for a"
"written examination. As such,
the Chairman of
the 1st Respondent
in his"
"affidavit
further
stated
that
it had been an inadvertence
on part
of
the"
"officers who
issued
the
application
forms
as well
as
the
officers who"
"accepted the duly filled application forms."
