"The Article 14 of
the Constitution of
India which recognizes equality before"
"the law is remarkably similar to Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka"
"and although it
is ex-facie apparent
that
the latter Article is wider in scope"
"compared to the former, whereas the jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court of"
"India
pertinent
to
petitions
and
appeals
claiming
infringements
of"
"fundamental
rights is wider
than that of
the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka,"
"such divergences, as very correctly expounded by Yasantha Kodagoda, PC.,"
"J.
in the Judgment of Wijerathna v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority, at p. 18,"
"“should
not
debar
Sri
Lankan
justices
from where
appropriate,
taking"
"persuasive cognizance of
Indian jurisprudence relating to the interpretation of"
"the substantive legal concepts embodied in the ‘right to equality’.”"
"Therefore, after cautious perusal and contemplation of
the law,
the need for"
"such law and the development of the concept of equality as discussed above,"
"I am inclined to align myself with the interpretation that a Petitioner being"
"discriminated against another person who was similarly circumstanced as"
"the Petitioner is not
the sole criterion for successfully pleading a violation of"
"right
to equality, as arbitrary, mala fide and unreasonable executive action"
"is also seen as being inconsistent with the very concept of equality,
thereby"
"infringing upon the
right
to
equality before the law as guaranteed under"
"Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"Accordingly,
I hold that
the decision of
the 1st Respondent
to depart
from"
"the
already
established criteria for
internal appointments
in the
form of"
"Circular 16/2003 in this instance is arbitrary, mala fide and unreasonable,"
"and thereby violated the fundamental rights of the Petitioners as guaranteed"
"by Article 12(1) of the Constitution."
"I will now briefly
examine whether
the practice of
the 1st Respondent of"
"allocating 30% of vacancies to be filled by those above the age of 50 years,"
"disregarding the written examination and based solely on the interview, and"
"assurances made
to
the
Petitioners
by
the
1st Respondent
and/or
its"
"officers
that
the
Petitioners
need
only
nominally
sit
for
the
written"
"examination and
the
results
thereon would not
be
a
deciding
factor
in"
"selection for appointments, gave rise to a legitimate expectation."
"In the case of Fernando v. Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. [2006]"
"3 Sri LR 141, Gamini Amaratunga, J. held that;"
"“The existence of a legitimate expectation, as opposed to a legally enforceable"
"right,
is a relevant
factor in considering the just and equitable relief this Court"
"may grant under Article 126 (4) of
the Constitution when it
is shown that
the"
"action of
the executive which frustrates the legitimate expectation amounts to"
