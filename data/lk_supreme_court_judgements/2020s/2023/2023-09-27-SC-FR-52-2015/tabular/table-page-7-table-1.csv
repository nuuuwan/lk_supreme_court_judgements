"The Respondents
in their
further written submissions
stated
that
by
a"
"joint-motion dated 08.12.2021,
the Letters of Promotion of
the 1st, 2nd, 4th"
"and 5th Petitioners to the rank of Assistant Security Officer were tendered as"
"directed
by
the Court.
The
said
promotions were
granted
based
on
a"
"Notification issued in 2017, applications submitted by the said Petitioners"
"and
based
on
interviews
held
in
2018,
pursuant
to
the
filing
of
this"
"Application and tendering of Objections on behalf of
the Respondents. The"
"Respondents
further
stated
that
the
Petitioners
have
now retired
from"
"service and therefore,
the only remaining issue is with regard to the effective"
"date of promotions to the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th Petitioners to the said posts."
"Accordingly,
the Respondents have submitted that
the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th"
"Petitioners were promoted as Assistant Security Officers based on a process"
"which commenced subsequent
to the filing of this Application and they were"
"not eligible to be promoted to the said posts based on the process which"
"commenced in 2013. Therefore,
the Respondents have not
infringed upon"
"the fundamental
rights of
the Petitioners as guaranteed by Article 12(1) of"
"the Constitution."
"Before moving
to
determine
the
Application of
the
Petitioners upon its"
"merits,
I
have
to
first
consider
the
preliminary
objection taken by
the"
"Respondents in their written submissions that
the Petitioners Application is"
"time barred and therefore,
it should be dismissed as the Petitioners have"
"failed to comply with the mandatory time limit
requirement prescribed in"
"Article 126(2) of the constitution."
"Article 126(2) reads as follows;"
"“Where any person alleges that any such fundamental right or language right"
"relating
to
such person has been infringed or
is about
to be
infringed by"
"executive or administrative action, he may himself or by an attorney-at-law on"
"his behalf, within one month thereof,
in accordance with such rules of court as"
"may be
in force, apply to the Supreme Court by way of petition in writing"
"addressed to
such Court
praying
for
relief
or
redress
in respect
of
such"
"infringement…”"
"The effect of Article 126(2) as stipulated above is that a Petition alleging an"
"infringement or imminent infringement of fundamental rights should be filed"
"within a
period
of
one month of
such alleged infringement
or
imminent"
"infringement and failure to comply with this requirement would render such"
"Petition time barred and unmaintainable."
"Accordingly,
the Respondents contend in their written submissions that the"
"Application of
the
Petitioners
is
time
barred
for
the
reason that
it was"
