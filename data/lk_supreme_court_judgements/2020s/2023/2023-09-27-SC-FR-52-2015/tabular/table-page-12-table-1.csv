"Therefore, after careful consideration of
the law and discrepancies inherent"
"in
the
submissions
of
the
Respondents,
I
reject
the
argument
of
the"
"Respondents
that Circular 16/2003 is no
longer
in force in view of
the"
"document marked 2R2, and hold that Circular 16/2003 is still
in force and"
"as such,
it
is the presently applicable Scheme of Recruitment
in respect of"
"the Petitioners."
"Accordingly,
I also reject
the preliminary objection of Respondents that
the"
"instant Application is time barred as they have preferred the Application on"
"06.03.2015 while the purported new Scheme of Recruitment was introduced"
"on 11.02.2013, as I have already held that Circular 16/2003 is still
in force"
"and has remained in force during the entirety of
the time period concerned"
"and is in fact the applicable Scheme of Recruitment to the Petitioners."
"As leave to proceed was granted under Article 12(1) of the Constitution,
it is"
"now necessary to analyze the relevant
facts and material submitted before"
"this Court
to ascertain whether the decision of the 1st Respondent to depart"
"from Circular 16/2003 amounts
to a violation of
fundamental
rights as"
"aforesaid."
"Article 12(1) of the Constitution reads as follows:"
"“All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal protection"
"of the law.”"
"The
Respondents
in
their written
submissions
have
brought
forth
the"
"contention that
they have acted in good faith and in terms of the Scheme of"
"Recruitment marked 2R2. Thus,
in order for the Petitioners to successfully"
"plead that
their
right
to equality as guaranteed under Article 12(1) of
the"
"Constitution has
been violated,
they must
prove
that
they were
in fact"
"discriminated against other persons who were similarly circumstanced as"
"them, which they were in fact not in the current situation at hand. However,"
"the
Petitioners,
on the
other hand, have
contended
that
the
concept
of"
"equality as guaranteed by Article 12(1) has since evolved and the violation of"
"a rule laid down by an authority would also amount
to an infringement of"
"the right
to equality, as the Court has in several Judgments, focused on the"
"requirement
of
ensuring
reasonableness
as
opposed
to
requiring"
"arbitrariness to find an infringement of Article 12(1)."
"The former position taken up by the Respondents in respect of
the right
to"
"equality was upheld in the case of Perera v. Jayawickrama [1985] 1 SLR"
"285
by
a
Full Bench
of
this Court.
The majority
opinion delivered
by"
"Sharvananda, CJ. held that;"
