"S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013"
"an  assignment  to  “assist”  the  Cultural  Development  Officer, 
in  the"
"supervision of minor staff."
"The  NSCC,  by 
its 
letter  dated  09.10.2012 
rejected 
the 
said"
"proposed  amendments 
to  SOR, 
indicating 
there  was  no  sufficient"
"reasons  to  change  its  decision  to  place  them  in  the  salary  scale  MN-1-"
"2006  (P19).    Within  a  month  of  the  said  letter,  the  3rd  Petitioner  and"
"others 
lodged 
a 
complaint  with 
the  HRCSL 
under 
reference"
"HRC/4070/2012 
(P20).  During 
the 
ensuing 
inquiry 
before 
the"
"Commission,  the  NSCC  provided  further  reasons  for  its  decision  in"
"P23A, by way of a reply to specific issues that had been raised. In that"
"letter the NSCC clarified its position that although the Petitioners were"
"placed initially under TB 2-1, before placing them under MN-1-2006 in"
"terms  of  P.A. Circular  No.  6/2006,  the  mere  fact of  placement of  some"
"others  who  too  were  initially  under  salary  scale  TB  2-1  in  MN-2-2006,"
"does  not  make  the  Petitioners  entitled  to  be  placed  under  the  salary"
"scale  MN-2-2006.  This 
is  due  to  the  reason  that  subsequent  salary"
"revisions 
implemented  under  different  Circulars  had 
introduced"
"changes in the applicable salary scales and with the implementation of"
"P.A.  Circular  No.  6/2006,  and 
it  was 
therefore 
imperative 
for 
the"
"categorisation  of  posts/service  of  the  entire  Public  Service  into  several"
"categories as stipulated in that circular."
"During  the  process  of  re-categorisation,  the  relevant  Ministries"
"and  Departments  were 
expected 
to 
take 
into 
consideration 
the"
"responsibilities  that  are  assigned  to  each  of  such  posts/services.  The"
"NSCC  cites  an  example  to  highlight  its  point  by  stating  that  no  direct"
"comparison could be made to the former salary scales to the new set of"
"salary  scales  introduced  by  the  P.A.  Circular  No.  6/2006,  by  way  of  a"
