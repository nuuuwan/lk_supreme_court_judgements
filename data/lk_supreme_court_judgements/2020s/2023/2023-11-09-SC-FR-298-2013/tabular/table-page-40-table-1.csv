Rejection of P17 and 18 by NSCC

Request of 1st Respondent to re-consider its 
P21"
"decision P19"
"17.01.2013 
Rejection of the request to re-consider the 
P22"
"decision P19 made by P21"
"The Petitioners tendered their petitions before this Court, alleging"
"infringement  of  their  fundamental  rights,  only  on  28.08.2013.  Thus,  at"
"first  glance, 
it  would 
appear 
that 
the  Petitioners  have 
invoked"
"jurisdiction  of  this  Court  well  after  the  stipulated  time  period  of  one"
"month  from  the  date  of  the 
last  decision 
in  the  said  series  of  the"
"decisions,  against  each  of  which  infringements  of  fundamental  rights"
"are  alleged.  However,  an  in-depth  review  of  the  available  material,  as"
"revealed from the pleadings itself, indicate that at least one of the reliefs"
"prayed  for  by  the  Petitioners,  namely  the  impugned  decision  of  the"
"NSCC  to  reject  P17  and  18  (paragraph  (c)  to  the  prayer),  is  not  time"
"barred and therefore could be considered by this Court."
"The reasons are as follows;"
