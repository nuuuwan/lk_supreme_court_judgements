"The Petitioners primarily relied on three factors in mounting their"
"challenge  on 
the  correctness  of 
the  decisions 
to  place 
the  post  of"
"Assistant  Cultural  Development  Officer  in  the  salary  scale  of  MN-1-"
"2006-A,  alleging 
that 
the  said  decision  was  made  arbitrarily  and"
"unreasonably.  First, 
they  contended 
that 
they  ought 
to  have  been"
"categorised  as  Supervisory  Management  Assistants 
in  view  of 
the"
"supervisory functions they perform. Secondly, they contended the post"
"of  Assistant 
Cultural  Development  Officer 
should 
have 
been"
"categorised  as  Supervisory  Management  Assistant 
instead  of 
their"
"current  categorisation  as  Management  Assistants  –  Non  Technical  -"
"Segment  2,  as  they  perform  multiple  duties,  which  would  make  them"
"entitled  to be  placed  in  salary  scale  MN-3-2006-A.    In  support of  these"
"two  factors,  Petitioner  relied  on  a  comparison  with  the  categorisation"
"adopted by the NSCC in relation to the post of Postal Services Officers"
"along  with 
the 
salary 
scale 
approved 
for 
that 
service.  Thirdly,"
"Petitioners  contended  that  the  SOR  recommended  by  the  NSCC    had"
"lowered the entry qualifications."
"Learned Solicitor General, representing the Respondents, strongly"
"resisted  the  contention  of  the  Petitioners  to  place  themselves  in  the"
"salary 
scale 
of  MN-3-2006-A 
and 
to 
re-categorise 
their  post 
as"
"Supervisory Management Assistant."
