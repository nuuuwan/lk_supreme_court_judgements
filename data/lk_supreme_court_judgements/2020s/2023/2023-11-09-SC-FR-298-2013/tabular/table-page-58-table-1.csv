"S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013"
"Assistants  who  are  “in  charge  of  supervisory  functions”  in  terms  of  P.A."
"Circular No. 6/2006."
"Learned  President’s  Counsel’s 
contention 
on 
the 
issue 
of"
"performing multifunctional duties was that the relevant documentation"
"clearly indicate that they do perform multi-functional duties, in terms of"
"the  special  set  of  instructions  issued  for  recruitment  of  Supervisory"
"Management – Non Technical with corresponding salary scale MN-03-"
"2006-A 
(P13).  The 
contention 
that 
the  post  of  Assistant  Cultural"
"Development  Officer  was  erroneously  categorised  as  Management"
"Assistants – Non Technical – Segment 2 and were placed in salary scale"
"MN-1-2006-A  by  the  NSCC,  was  founded  on  the  claim  that  they  are"
"expected  to  perform  “multi-functional  ”  duties  and  supervises  other"
"employees. 
In  support  of 
the  said  contention, 
learned  President’s"
"Counsel  had 
listed  out  different 
functions 
the  Assistant  Cultural"
"Development  Officers 
are 
expected 
to  perform,  which 
included"
"functions 
related 
to  managing 
finances, 
field 
duties, 
library"
"management,  “supervisory”  functions  and  assignment  of  other  duties."
"Thus,  they  contend,  the  performance  of  these  multiple  duties  should"
"satisfy the definition contained in paragraph 3.2 at page 2 of Annexure"
"II  for  “multi-functional”  duties    and  thereby  made  them  entitled  to  be"
"placed at the salary scale of MN-03-2006-A."
"The  Respondents  challenged  the  validity  of  the  said  contention,"
"which meant to impress upon this Court that the  said categorisation is"
"an erroneously made decision by the NSCC. Learned Solicitor General,"
"in  her  submissions  contended  that  the  fact  of  assignment  of  several"
"duties  does  not  mean  the  Petitioners  are  in  fact  assigned  with  “multi-"
"functional”  duties  in  terms  of  P.A.  Circular  No.  6/2006.  She  further"
