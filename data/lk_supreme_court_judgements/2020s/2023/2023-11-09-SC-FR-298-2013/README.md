infringement of their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1)

of the Constitution. Their complaint of infringement is based on

categorisation of the post of Assistant Cultural Development Officer as

Management Assistant Non Technical Segment 2 and placement of

that post in salary scale of MN-1-2006-A in the approved Scheme of

Recruitment. The Petitioners further complain that the National Salaries

and Cadre Commission (hereinafter referred to as NSCC) had

infringed their fundamental right to equality by its decision to reject the

1st Respondents request to grant approval to amend the Scheme of

Recruitment (hereinafter referred to as SOR), in which they were

categorised as Supervisory Management Assistant and placing in salary

scale of MN-3- 2006-A. They allege their rights were further infringed

by the NSCC, by approving the said SOR, which contain the impugned

categorisation and placement and recommending same to the Public

Service Commission, in terms of Public Administration Circular No.

6/2006.

The Petitioners have named the members of the NSCC as 13th to

27th Respondents and, by way of an amended petition dated 13.02.2014,

added the members of its succeeding entity, National Salaries

Commission, as the 30th to 50th Respondents.

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

30

The Petitioners, in their amended petition have prayed for inter

alia the following reliefs from this Court;

i. a declaration that the Petitioners fundamental rights

guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution has been

infringed;

ii. to declare null and void the decision/recommendation of

the National Salaries Commission and/or the 13th to 27th

Respondents to refuse the proposal of the 1st Respondent to

categorise Assistant Cultural Development Officers as

Supervisory Management Assistants and place them in

Salary scale MN-3-2006-A;

iii. to declare null and void the decision of the 1st and/or 3rd

Respondent to implement the recommendation of the

National Salaries and Cadre Commission to categorise

Assistant Cultural Development Officers as Management

Assistants Non-Technical Segment 2 and place them in

salary scale MN-1-2006-A;

iv. to declare null and void the decision of the 1st and/or 3rd

Respondent to categorise Assistant Cultural Development

Officers as Management Assistants Non- Technical

Segment 2 and place them in salary scale MN-1-2006-A;

v. to make order directing the NSCC and/or the 13th to 26th

Respondents and/or the 3rd and/or 28th Respondents to

recommend the proposal of the 1st Respondent to

categorise Assistant Cultural Development Officers as

Supervisory Management Assistants and to place them in

salary scale MN-3- 2006-A;

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

31

vi. to make order directing the 1st Respondent and/or the 3rd

Respondent to categorise Assistant Cultural Development

Officers as Supervisory Management Assistants and to

place them in salary scale MN-3-2006-A;

vii. in the event the proposed Scheme of Recruitment, by which

the educational qualifications required for recruitment to

the post of Assistant Cultural Development Officer was

brought down to one pass at the GCE(A/L) Examination

has been approved by the Public Service Commission,

make order cancelling the decision of the Public Service

Commission (4th to 12th Respondents) to approve the same

inasmuch as it is contrary to the policy decision taken by

the Cabinet of Ministers acting under Article 55(4) of the

Constitution;

viii. to declare null and void the decision of the 1st and/or 3rd

Respondent to make recruitments to the post of Assistant

Cultural Development Officers from among those who

have passed only one subject at the GCE(A/L)

Examination, contrary to the policy decision taken by the

Cabinet of Ministers acting under Article 55(4) of the

Constitution;

ix. to direct the National Pay Commission and/or the 30th to

50th Respondents to recommend the proposal of the 1st

Respondent to categorise Assistant Cultural Development

Officers as Supervisory Management Assistants and place

them in salary scale MN-3-2006-A.

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

32

It is evident from the wide spectrum of reliefs sought by the

Petitioners, that their complaint of infringement of right to equality

stems from the decision of the NSCC, in refusing to accept a proposal

submitted by the 1st Respondent to categorise the post of Assistant

Cultural Development Officers as Supervisory Management Assistants

and place them in salary scale MN-3-2006-A by amending the approved

SOR for that post. They also challenge the recommendation made by

NSCC to the Public Service Commission to lower the qualifications

required for recruitment to the post of Assistant Cultural Development

Officers.

When the instant petition was supported for leave to proceed,

learned Solicitor General, who represented the Respondents, raised a

preliminary objection on their behalf and sought for its dismissal in

limine. Her objection was that the placement of the Petitioners in salary

scale of MN-1-2006 was made by the NSCC in the year 2006, as

evidenced by the appointment letters issued to them at the time of

confirmation of their appointments to the post of Assistant Cultural

Development Officer. Therefore, she contended that the challenge on

the validity of the decision to place them in the said salary scale, being

the core complaint of the Petitioners before this Court, is clearly time-

barred. The learned Presidents Counsel sought to counter the said

objection by presenting a contention that the Petitioners became aware

of the decision made by the NSCC only on 09.10.2012, when it rejected

the proposed amendment to the Scheme of Recruitment, which sought

to place them in salary scale MN-3-2006-A.

After hearing submissions of the parties on the said preliminary

objection, this Court made order on 24.02.2014, that the issue of time bar

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

33

would be re-considered upon completion of pleadings, in order to

satisfy itself whether the material presented before Court discloses the

fact that there had been a failure to invoke jurisdiction within the

prescribed time period.

It must be noted that at that stage of the proceedings, only the

amended petition and its annexures were available before Court and

none of the Respondents had tendered their Statement of Objections.

The 27th Respondent tendered his Statement of Objections on 16.02.2016

and the 55th Respondent tendered Objections on 29.02.2016, followed by

counter affidavit of the Petitioners tendered on 20.06.2017.

Hence, this Court should consider the said preliminary objection

at the very outset of this judgment, in the light of factors disclosed by

the completed set of pleadings and make an appropriate determination

on the question of time bar.

The prayer to the amended petition of the Petitioners, as quoted

above, sets out the nature of multiple reliefs sought from this Court.

The entitlement to the substantial relief prayed by the Petitioners, being

a declaration of infringement of their fundamental rights guaranteed to

them under Article 12(1), is dependent on the validity of the impugned

decision to place them on salary scale of MN-01-2006-A and

categorisation of the post of Assistant Cultural Development Officers as

Management Assistant Non Technical Segment 2, as they also seek

annulment of these decisions. In addition, the Petitioners challenge the

validity of the rejection of the proposed amendments to the SOR. There

had been a series of subsequent decisions made by the Respondents,

consequent to the said initial decision, by which the impugned

categorisation and applicable salary scale were determined after the

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

34

issuance of Public Administration Circular No. 06/2006 (hereinafter

referred to as P.A. Circular No. 6/2006), culminating with the decision

to reject the proposed amendment to the SOR (P17). The NSCC decided

to continue with its earlier decision, even after having re-considered the

issue upon representations made by the concerned parties (P22).

The Petitioners seek annulment of all these decisions. Table No.

1, that appears below contain the nature of the reliefs along with the

dates on which the impugned decisions were arrived at.

Date of SOR (P10) on 22.06.2012 (27R11)

The decision to place the Petitioners in salary scale MN-01-2006

after re-categorisation, in terms of the P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, was

made in the year 2006 itself. This is evident from the Letters of

Appointment issued to 3rd and 36th Petitioners on 24.07.2006 (P8C) and

04.08.2006 (P8A) respectively. This placement was made on the

recommendation of the 1st Respondent and pending approval by the

NSCC. The Petitioners claim they did voice their objections to the said

placement at that point of time but was told that it would be rectified

with the finalisation of their SOR. However, the Petitioners did not

annex any document to their amended petition, which tends to indicate

either they did make representations against that decision after it was

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

36

made known to them or was told that their concerns would be

addressed to, once the formulation of the SOR (P10) in finalised.

The 27th Respondent, being the Secretary to National Salaries

Commission (hereinafter referred to as NSC), refuted the claim of the

Petitioners that only in 2012 a SOR was formulated for the post of

Assistant Cultural Development Officers, as the draft SOR was first

submitted to the NSCC by the 1st Respondent in the year 2005 and an

amended SOR was once again submitted with the same salary scale

MN-1-2006 in the year 2006 (27R3D).

According to the Petitioners, the Scheme of Recruitment (P10)

was presented for consideration and approval of the NSCC by the 1st

Respondent on 25.05.2012. However, the 1st Respondent had already

tendered a proposed Scheme of Recruitment to NSCC on 19.05.2006

seeking its approval (27R3D) on identical terms. Be that as it may, the

NSCC conveyed its approval to the SOR (P10) by letter dated 22.06.2012

(27R11) to the Director General of Establishments. The said SOR

contained categorisation of Assistant Cultural Development Officers as

Management Assistant Non -Technical Segment 2, in terms of the

P.A. Administration Circular No. 6/2006 and placed them in salary

scale of MN-1-2006-A. The NSCC also conveyed its decision to the 1st

Respondent by letter dated 09.10.2012 (P19).

The Petitioners made representations to the 1st Respondent

against the said SOR only on 17.05.2012 (P16A). This is the first time

that the Petitioners have ever indicated their opposition in any form to

their categorisation and salary scale. The contents of P16A does not

refer to the fact that the Petitioners did present their grievances to any

of the Respondents any time prior to that particular instance, either on

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

37

the question of categorisation or on the applicable salary scale, after the

implementation of P.A. Circular No. 6/2006.

The proposed SOR (P17), with which the Petitioners agree, was

also prepared by the 1st Respondent and submitted to NSCC on

13.09.2012 and the decision to reject the said proposed Scheme of

Recruitment was arrived at by the Commission on 09.10.2012 (P19).

The 3rd Petitioner and some of her colleagues have lodged a

complaint with HRCSL on 06.11.2012 (P20) alleging that, despite having

been assigned with multiple duties, they were placed in salary scale

MN-01-2006 instead of MN-03-2006, disregarding their objections. The

3rd Petitioners complaint to the HRCSL was made within a month of

the rejection of the 2nd proposed amendment to the SOR (P17).

However, the NSCC had, by then, already made its decision on

04.10.2006, to place the Assistant Cultural Development Officers in

salary scale MN-01-2006-A (27R2C) and approved the said

categorisation as reflected in SOR (P10). The NSCC, by letter addressed

to the Director General of Public Administration on 22.06.2012 (27R11)

conveyed its approval. The 1st Respondent too had recommended the

said categorisation and the salary scale throughout but entertained a

different view and indicated it to NSCC only in the latest of his

recommendation (P18).

The 1st Respondent, by his letter dated 21.11.2012 (P21),

requested the NSCC to re-consider its decision (P19). The NSCC had re-

considered its decision and informed the 1st Respondent on 17.01.2013

that the Commission found no reason to change its already reached

decision as to the categorisation, as reflected in the Scheme of

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

38

Recruitment, and the salary scale in relation to the post of Assistant

Cultural Development Officer (P22).

In view of the interrelatedness of the contents of the

recommendation and directions and the dates on which the said

decisions were arrived at by the Respondents, it is helpful if the said

series of decisions, made in relation to the categorisation of the

Petitioners as Management Assistants Non- Technical Segment 2

with salary scale of MN-1-2006-A, are arranged in a chronological order

for the consideration of the time bar objection in its proper context.

Table No. 2, which appears below, should satisfy that requirement.

The Petitioners tendered their petitions before this Court, alleging

infringement of their fundamental rights, only on 28.08.2013. Thus, at

first glance, it would appear that the Petitioners have invoked

jurisdiction of this Court well after the stipulated time period of one

month from the date of the last decision in the said series of the

decisions, against each of which infringements of fundamental rights

are alleged. However, an in-depth review of the available material, as

revealed from the pleadings itself, indicate that at least one of the reliefs

prayed for by the Petitioners, namely the impugned decision of the

NSCC to reject P17 and 18 (paragraph (c) to the prayer), is not time

barred and therefore could be considered by this Court.

The reasons are as follows;

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

41

The original petition of the Petitioners is lodged with the Registry

of this Court on 28.08.2013 whereas their amended petition, by which

the members of the newly constituted NSC are added to its caption (30th

to 50th Respondents), was tendered on 13.02.2014. Of the several

Petitioners who are before this Court, only the 3rd Petitioner had

challenged the decision of the NSCC (P19) to reject the proposed

amendments to SOR before the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka

(hereinafter referred to as HRCSL) within the statutorily specified

period of time (P20). Nonetheless, the 3rd Petitioner failed to annex any

communication or at least an acknowledgement issued by the HRCSL

on her complaint indicating that the matter is under its consideration.

More importantly, the 3rd Petitioner failed to disclose the names of other

collegues who joined with her in the complaint to HRCSL (P20). There

is no material placed before this Court indicating whether there are any

Petitioners among those who joined with her in the lodgment of the

said complaint to the HRCSL. It could be that another group of

Assistant Cultural Development Officers, who opted not to join the

Petitioners in the instant application, supported the 3rd Petitioner with

her in that complaint.

Paragraphs 64 and 65 of the amended petition of the Petitioners

indicate that the inquiry into the 3rd Petitioners complaint had been

concluded and recommendations of the said Commission is pending.

No supporting material were placed before this Court to indicate this

position. However, the written representations of the NSCC, tendered

to the NSCC (P23A) confirms that an inquiry into complaint by the 3rd

Petitioner, under reference No. HRC/4070/201 to HRCSL was

conducted by the said Commission. The 27th Respondent further

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

42

admits in his Statement of Objection that the said Commission is yet to

make its recommendation.

As already noted, the alleged infringements complained to this

Court are in relation to the placement of the Petitioners in salary scale

MN-01-2006-A and rejection of the proposed amendment to the

SOR(P17), which meant to categorise their post as Supervisory

Management Assistant and to place them in the salary scale of MN-03-

2006-A. In view of the objection of time bar taken up by the learned

Solicitor General, only the relief prayed for in sub paragraph (c) of the

prayer of the Petitioners qualifies to be considered. If the Petitioners are

successful in establishing their entitlement to paragraph (c) of the

prayer, then they are also entitled to succeed in obtaining relief as

prayed for in paragraph (f) to the prayer as well.

This is due to the reason that the letter conveying the rejection of

the proposed amendment to the SOR is dated 21.09.2012 (P18) and the

3rd Petitioner had lodged a complaint with the HRCSL on 06.11.2012,

within a month of the said decision, in terms of Section 13(1) of the

Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996. Therefore,

she is entitled to the benefit of the statutory provision which states that

the period within which the inquiry into such complaint is pending before

the Commission, shall not be taken into account in computing the period of one

month within which an application may be made to the Supreme Court by such

person in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution.

It is relevant to note in this context, the manner in which the

Petitioners have described the alleged infringement in their amended

petition. Paragraph 67 of the said amended petition reads thus;

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

43

[T]he Petitioners state that the decision of the 13th to 26th

Respondents (National Salaries and Cadre Commission) to refuse the

recommendation of the 1st Respondent to categorise Assistant Cultural

Development Officers as Supervisory Management Assistants and placed them

in salary scale of MN-03-2006-A and the decision of the 1st to 3rd Respondents

to make recruitment to the post of Assistant Cultural Development Officers

from among those who have passed only one subject at the G.C.E. (A/L) is

arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable .

The Petitioners did not present their allegation of infringement of

their fundamental rights by executive or administrative action of the

Respondents as a continuing act of violation. The paragraph quoted

above is clear that the executive and administrative complained of by

the Petitioners is restricted to refuse the recommendation of the 1st

Respondent to categorise Assistant Cultural Development Officers as

Supervisory Management Assistants and place them in salary scale of MN-03-

2006-A. The said refusal by NSCC was conveyed to the 1st Respondent

on 09.10.2012 (P19) and the original petition was lodged only on

29.08.2013.

The resultant position therefore is that only the 3rd Petitioner is

entitled to pursue the infringement of her fundamental rights before

this Court, and that too is confined to the relief prayed for in paragraph

(c) and (f), which could be related to the complaint made to the HRCSL

within one month of the said decision. As rightly contended by the

learned Solicitor General, the decisions that were made thereafter and

impugned in the instant application are clearly time barred in terms of

the Article 126(2) of the Constitution, which imposes a mandatory

requirement to invoke jurisdiction of Court, within one month since the

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

44

infringement committed by executive or administrative action. The 2nd

request of the 1st Respondent made to the NSCC, subsequent to the one

already made in P18, urging it to reconsider the decision P19, was on

21.11.2012 (P21). The NSCC rejected that request on 17.01.2013 (P22).

The decision P 22 is also caught up with the time bar objection and on

that account, should be excluded from consideration. Hence, the

decisions of the NSCC, contained in 27R3D, 27R3, 27R2B, P10 and P22

could not be considered for its validity.

The decisions that are to be considered by this Court are thus

restricted to the refusal by the NSCC to re-consider its decision on P17

and P18, which was conveyed to the 1st Respondent by letter dated

09.10.2012 (P19).

In view of the above findings, this Court must then consider the

entitlement of the 3rd Petitioner to the reliefs prayed by her. The claims

of other petitioners ought to be dismissed, owing to the fact that they

failed to present their claim of infringement of fundamental rights

before this Court within the stipulated time period imposed by Article

126(2). Since the 3rd Petitioner is one among many who presented an

identical allegation of infringement of her fundamental rights along

with the other Petitioners, for convenience in the presentation of this

judgment, the term Petitioners used in the preceding part of the

judgment, would be continued in the latter part as well.

In paragraph (c) of her prayer, the 3rd Petitioner seeks a

declaration from Court stating that the decision and/or

recommendation of the National Salaries and Cadre Commission (13th

to 27th Respondents) to refuse the proposal of the 1st Respondent to

categorise Assistant Cultural Development Officers as supervisory

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

45

Management Assistants and place them in salary scale of MN-3-2006-A

is null and void, whereas in paragraph (f) she seeks an order of Court

directing the National Salaries and Cadre Commission (13th to 27th

Respondents) and 28th Respondent to recommend the proposal of the 1st

Respondent for an amended SOR, as contained in P17.

In order to consider the allegation of the Petitioners that their

right to equality was infringed in the context of the decisions of the

NSCC that are not time barred, it is necessary for this Court to consider

the circumstances under which the post of Assistant Cultural

Development Officer was originally created, the nature of the

responsibilities that were conferred on the said post, the parameters

under which the said post was categorised as Management Assistants

Non Technical Segment 2 and placed in salary scale MN-1-2006-A in

terms of Public Administration Circular No. 6 of 2006 and the

reasonableness of the refusal of the proposal by the 1st Respondent to

categorise Assistant Cultural Development Officers as Supervisory

Management Assistants and place them in Salary scale MN-3-2006-A

and the reasonableness of the decision to lower the entry qualifications.

In the year 1988, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and National

Heritage, initiated an island wide programme to establish 300 Regional

Cultural Centres with a view to arrest the gradual erosion of cultural

values and practises from our society and to preserve them for future

generations. These Cultural Centres were intended to provide

opportunities for youth to enhance their innate aesthetic talents and

also meant to dissuade them from engaging in anti-social activities.

Each of these Cultural Centres were to be staffed by four employees,

i.e., a Cultural Development Officer, a Cultural Assistant, an Office

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

46

Assistant and a Security Officer. Recruitment process to fill the said

posts commenced in the year 1999 with public notices inserted in the

national newspapers calling for applications.

The Petitioners, having fulfilled the eligibility criterion for the

post of Cultural Assistants (P2) by successfully completing four subjects

at the G.C.E.(A/L) Examination and six subjects at the G.C.E.(O/L)

Examination with four Credit passes including Mathematics and

Sinhala, along with pass in Sinhala Typing at the G.C.E.(O/L)

Examination or completion of a typing/computer course at a

recognised institute, and being below 45 years of age, applied for the

said post. After interviewing the Petitioners, they were recruited as

Cultural Assistants by the Central Cultural Fund (2nd Respondent) on

contract basis and were assigned to the newly established Regional

Cultural Centres. Recruitment of Cultural Assistants continued after the

first batch of recruitment had taken place in the year 1999, as and when

new Cultural Centres were established.

On 08.12.2004, in addressing the grievance of these Cultural

Assistants, the Cabinet of Ministers approved their absorption into

Public Service. They were initially recruited by the Central Cultural

Fund on contract. The said decision was made consequent to the

recommendations of a Cabinet Sub-Committee on Establishment

Matters (P6), which was established to resolve certain issues faced by

the Ministry and Cultural Assistants, who served in their posts for

several years without being confirmed in their posts.

The said report included following recommendations;

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

47

a. Cultural Officers and other staff who have been recruited on

contract basis in accordance with the Scheme of Recruitment

and who have already satisfied the requisite qualifications be

absorbed into such posts on permanent basis with effect from

the date of the Cabinet decision,

b. The said officers are to be placed two increments above the

relevant salary scale applicable to theirs posts, but personal to

them in consideration of their experience along with previous

service in the field,

c. The recruitment of remaining staff to be made in a phased-out

basis and a total of 300 Assistant Cultural Development

Officers to be recruited from among those who have passed

the G.C.E.(A/L) Examination.

Consequent to the Cabinet decision on 22.12.2004, (P7) made on

the recommendation of its sub Committee the Petitioners were

absorbed into the Public Service, appointed to the post of Assistant

Cultural Officers of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and National

Heritage and were confirmed in their posts (P8D). Thus, the post of

Cultural Assistant was thereafter re-designated as Assistant Cultural

Officers in terms of the said Cabinet decision. However, the

appointment letters issued to the Petitioners described the post as

Assistant Cultural Development Officer (P8A).

The Assistant Cultural Development Officers were tasked to

assist the Cultural Officer, who was placed as the Officer-in-Charge of

the several Cultural Centres (vide proposed Scheme of Recruitment in

2006 (27R3D);

The Petitioners primarily relied on three factors in mounting their

challenge on the correctness of the decisions to place the post of

Assistant Cultural Development Officer in the salary scale of MN-1-

2006-A, alleging that the said decision was made arbitrarily and

unreasonably. First, they contended that they ought to have been

categorised as Supervisory Management Assistants in view of the

supervisory functions they perform. Secondly, they contended the post

of Assistant Cultural Development Officer should have been

categorised as Supervisory Management Assistant instead of their

current categorisation as Management Assistants Non Technical -

Segment 2, as they perform multiple duties, which would make them

entitled to be placed in salary scale MN-3-2006-A. In support of these

two factors, Petitioner relied on a comparison with the categorisation

adopted by the NSCC in relation to the post of Postal Services Officers

along with the salary scale approved for that service. Thirdly,

Petitioners contended that the SOR recommended by the NSCC had

lowered the entry qualifications.

Learned Solicitor General, representing the Respondents, strongly

resisted the contention of the Petitioners to place themselves in the

salary scale of MN-3-2006-A and to re-categorise their post as

Supervisory Management Assistant.

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

49

Having considered the circumstances under which the post of

Assistant Cultural Development Officer was created, the nature of the

responsibilities that were conferred on to the said post in the preceding

paragraphs, it is opportune at this stage to consider the reasonableness

of the decisions of the NSCC to reject the proposal by the 1st

Respondent to categorise Assistant Cultural Development Officers as

Supervisory Management Assistants and place them in Salary scale

MN-3-2006-A, in the light of the parameters set by the P.A. Circular No.

6 of 2006, under which the said post was categorised as Management

Assistants Non Technical Segment 2 and to place them in salary

scale MN-1-2006-A.

In view of the contention placed before this Court by the learned

Presidents Counsel on behalf of the Petitioners, the issue of applicable

salary scale arose with the implementation of the Government policy

through P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, and therefore it is relevant to devote

some space in this judgment to consider the changes made to the public

service as a whole by the said circular.

With a view to implement the budget proposals approved by the

Parliament in the year 2006, the Government decided to set up a new

salary structure for the employees in Public Service based on a

systematic categorisation of various posts and, issued Public

Administration Circular No. 06/2006. The said circular was revised

from time to time to address issues that had arisen in its

implementation. The underlying policy consideration of the

Government in the issuance of the said Circular was not only to

increase salaries of the Public Service, but also to implement a scheme

in which each of the posts in the service are re-categorised into 16 pre-

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

50

specified groups with a attribution of a new nomenclature to describe

such posts.

The P.A. Circular No. 6/2006 also intended to place the public

employees of a particular post within an appropriate salary scale,

selected among a set of 36 pre-determined salary scales, as indicated in

Annexure III of that circular and thereby reducing the 137 different

salary scales that existed under the scheme put in place by the Public

Administration Circular No. 9/2004.

This Court, in Padma Akarawita and Others v Dr. Nanda

Wickramasinghe and Others (SC(FR) Application No. 320/2007

decided on 02.11.2010), made the following observation on P.A.

Circular No. 6/2006;

It is important to note that PA Circular, No. 06/2006,

which deals with the Budget proposals is not a document

prepared merely for the purpose of increasing the salary of

government employees. On the contrary, the said

document had been prepared for the purpose of

restructuring the Public Service salaries based on Budget

proposals for 2006. Accordingly, the proposal referred to

in PA Circular, No. 06/2006 is different to all the other

Circulars referred to by the petitioners. By these

proposals, as stated by the 5th respondent, 126 different

salary scales that had existed previously had been reduced

to 37.

In terms of the P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, all posts in the Public

Service needed to be re-categorized based on the definitions given in

Annexure II and in terms of Annexure III which provided an index to

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

51

salary conversion. However, the post of Assistant Cultural

Development Officer was not included in the said list of posts set out in

Annexure III and therefore did not receive its categorisation under

Annexure II. In terms of the said circular, any posts/service that are not

included in the annexure III, the relevant Ministry/Department ought

to take prompt action to submit their proposals to the National Salaries

and Cadre Commission (NSCC) for its recommendations to the Public

Service Commission with a SOR in accordance with the appropriate

definition set out in the Annexure II. That requirement was fulfilled by

the 1st Respondent in the year 2006 but eventually received approval of

NSCC and was recommended to the Public Service Commission only in

the year 2012. Incidentally, the SOR of the Postal Services Officers of the

Unified Postal Services (55R1) which the Petitioners compared

themselves with also had been recommended by the NSCC to the

Public Service Commission on 30.11.2011 (55R1).

It is already noted, in terms of P.A. Circular No.6/2006, each

Ministry and Department is expected to re-categorise/re-group all

posts/services of public officers under its employment, based on the

definitions given in the Annexure II and in terms of Annexure III

Index to Salary Conversion. The said Circular identified four Service

Levels and admittedly the Petitioners are considered as Secondary

Level public officers and are accordingly categorised as Management

Assistants. In terms of the special set of instructions issued for

recruitment of Management Assistants Non Technical Segment 2

with salary scale MN-01-2006-A (P11), Management Assistants are

generally defined as public officers who facilitate and assist the

administrative, managerial and executive grades. Their entry

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

52

qualifications would differ in keeping with the duties assigned to them

and are accordingly further divided to form two sub-categories, i.e.

Management Assistants Non Technical and Management Assistants

Technical.

The Management Assistants Non Technical, are recruited

purely on educational qualifications. No technical expertise was

required for that post at the point or recruitment. The Service Level of

Management Assistants Non Technical are further divided into two

segments by the said Circular. Segment 1 consists of Management

Assistants Non Technical, whose basic educational qualifications at

the recruitment are G.C.E. (O/L) or (A/L) and should possess skills of a

defined nature, in addition to the said educational qualifications and

are assigned with multi-duties. Circular referred to the posts such as

Department of Posts Clerks, typists, stenographers, storekeepers,

shroffs, bookkeepers etc. as posts that fall under this categorisation.

Segment 2 in which the Petitioners are categorised into, consists of

employees whose basic educational qualifications, in terms of the SOR,

are a pass at the GCE- OL or AL examination and not required to

possess skills of any defined nature as an entry qualification but

assigned to perform multi-functional duties. There is no dispute that as

at present, the Petitioners are categorised as Management Assistants

Non Technical - Segment 2.

In relation to Service Level of Management Assistants, Annexure

II of P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, also creates and recognises yet another

distinct category, termed as Supervisory Management Assistants, who

are defined therein as Supervisory Management Assistants (Non

Technical/Technical). In the said set of special instruction to complete

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

53

the recruitments to the posts fall under the said categorisation (P13) the

category of Supervisory Management Assistant is broadly defined as

follows;

wdh;khkays Odhlfha ldhhkag Wmia:Nl jk fia Odhlh iska

ksYa; fldg mjrkq ,nk msrsia md,kh" uqo,a Ndrldrs;ajh yd uqo,a

mrsyrKh wlaIKh yd fufyhq hk lhhka we;=<;a nyqldh

(Multi-Functional) iajrEmfha ldhhka bgqlrk fiajd .Khls.

The qualifications that are set out in P13 in relation to

Supervisory Management Assistants (Non Technical) are, passes in six

subjects at the G.C.E.(O/L) examination, with credit passes for

Sinhala/Tamil/English, mathematics and two other subjects in one

attempt. In addition, pass in G.C.E. (A/L) examination in one attempt

along with completion of a course, recognised by Vocational Training

Commission, in word processing/ typewriting/stenography.

Thus, if a post held by an employee was to be categorised as

Supervisory Management Assistant (Non Technical) Segment 1, then

the post he or she hold should possess the following qualifications;

a. In addition to passing G.C.E.(O/L) in six subjects with credit

passes for Sinhala/Tamil/English, mathematics and two other

subjects in one attempt, passing G.C.E.(A/L) in three subjects

in one attempt,

b. should possess skills of a defined nature at the time of

recruitment,

c. being assigned supervisory functions,

d. being assigned with multi -functional duties.

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

54

The dispute presented to Court by the Petitioners, in their

entitlement of being categorised as Supervisory Management

Assistants, arises from the assertion that they fulfil all of these

qualifications. They relied heavily on the factors of having the entry

qualifications to be categorised as such and being assigned with

supervisory functions coupled with multiple duties. The Respondents

however strongly contend that the post of Assistant Cultural

Development Officer does not satisfy all of these qualifications, which

made the Petitioners disqualified to be categorised as Supervisory

Management Assistants. Learned Solicitor General particularly relied

on the job description to impress upon this Court that the Petitioners do

not function in a supervisory capacity and are not assigned with

multiple duties, in terms of P.A. Circular No. 6/2006.

The first of the two contentions referred to above shall be

considered now.

Learned Presidents Counsels contention was that the post of

Assistant Cultural Development Officer, instead of categorising as

Management Assistants (Non Technical) Segment 2, who are expected

to perform a single function, should have been correctly categorised as

Supervisory Management Assistants, in view of the multiple nature of

functions they perform, which are also supervisory in nature. It was

also submitted on behalf of the Petitioners that in terms of the P.A.

Circular No. 6/2006, a Management Assistant who perform supervisory

functions, irrespective of whether they are of Non Technical or

Technical, should be categorised as Supervisory Management

Assistants and as such, they should have been placed at salary scale

MN-3-2006-A. The Petitioners averred in their pleadings that they

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

55

supervise the Office Assistant attached to the Cultural Centre. In their

counter affidavit, the Petitioners stated that they have been assigned

with duties of managing finances of Cultural Centres, managing affairs

of the stores, to take part in the annual inventory inspections and also to

serve in various units of the Ministry and Universities, in support of the

said claims.

Learned Presidents Counsel, invited our attention to the duties

that are assigned to Assistant Cultural Development Officers by making

reference to contents of P12, where it is specifically stated that the sole

responsibility of managing the library of the Centre is vested with the

Assistant Cultural Development Officer, in addition to them being

given the supervisory responsibility of keeping the Cultural Centre

and its premises clean, and by placing the Office Assistants under their

supervision. He further referred to the observation made by the

Committee appointed by the 1st Respondent in its report (P16B) stating

that the Assistant Cultural Development Officers function as the

supervising officer of the Office Assistant and the Security Officer,

who are attached to each Centre. Learned Counsel further submitted

that this factor was highlighted by the 1st Respondent, in his

recommendation, forwarded to the NSCC to categorise the Petitioners

as Supervisory Management Assistants (P21).

The Petitioners claim of performing supervisory functions is

based on the factual assertion that the Office Assistant and Security

Officer attached to Cultural Centres are placed under their supervision.

However, in terms of the assignment of official duties (P12), an

Assistant Cultural Development Officer must discharge his duties

under the direct supervision of the Cultural Officer, who was appointed

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

56

as the Officer-in-Charge of the Centre and invested with its overall

responsibility. As submitted by learned Solicitor General, paragraph 4

of P12 indicates that it is the Assistant Cultural Development Officers

responsibility- ^j.lSu& to ensure the cleanliness of the Centre

through the Office Assistant assigned to that Centre. No reference to

any supervision over the members of minor staff was made in P12.

In the report of the Committee, appointed by the 1st Respondent

which inquired into and made recommendation on the grievances of

Assistant Cultural Development Officers, the only reference of them

performing a supervisory function is made in relation to the placement

of the Office Assistant and the Security Officer attached to the Cultural

Centre. However, the document P12, which sets out the responsibilities

of the Office Assistant, indicate a contrary position. Both these

documents confirm the fact that the Office Assistant was placed under

the direct supervision of the Officer-in-Charge, and not under the

supervision of the Assistant Cultural Development Officer. In the

proposed amendment to the SOR (P17) of the 1st Respondent, a similar

position is reflected in relation to the job description of the Office

Assistant as well as of the Security Officer assigned to a Cultural Centre.

Documents 27R3G and 27R3H describe the job description of the Office

Assistants and Security Officers, respectively and indicate that the

Office Assistant and Security Officer, assigned to a Cultural Centres, are

placed under the direct supervision of the Cultural Officer, negating the

Petitioners assertion.

There is another perspective in which the validity of the

Petitioners claim of performing supervisory functions should be

considered. The document containing the job description of the

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

57

Assistant Cultural Development Officers (P12) specifies the time period

they should function in their respective Cultural Centres. The Cultural

Centre should be kept open from 8.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m. for a period of

12 hours on a daily basis. In any given day, the Cultural Officer and the

Assistant Cultural Development Officer are expected to function at the

Centre for a period of nine hours, including 1-hour lunch break. The

Assistant Cultural Development Officers are expected to report to work

at 11.30 a.m. and remain in the centre until 8.30 p.m. The Cultural

Officer, being the Officer-in-Charge of the Cultural Centre, who should

report to work at 8.30 a.m., will remain at the Centre until 5.30 p.m. and

only from that time onward the Assistant Cultural Development Officer

will function without the formers physical supervision and that too for

the remaining three hour period until closing time of the Centre at 8.30

p.m. This is the only time the Petitioners are expected to perform any

form of supervision over the two members of minor staff and that too

in the acting capacity and on behalf of the Cultural Officer. This factor

does not make the Petitioners are assigned with supervisory duties in

terms of P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, because, anyway they are expected

to cover duties of the Cultural Officer during his absence, being the

normal working arrangement for this type of establishments, that are

manned by a limited staff.

In view of the above, I am more inclined to accept the

submissions of the learned Solicitor General that the post of Assistant

Cultural Development Officer is not conferred with any supervisory

functions over the Office Assistant or the Security Officer of the Centre

and therefore are not entitled to be considered as Management

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

58

Assistants who are in charge of supervisory functions in terms of P.A.

Circular No. 6/2006.

Learned Presidents Counsels contention on the issue of

performing multifunctional duties was that the relevant documentation

clearly indicate that they do perform multi-functional duties, in terms of

the special set of instructions issued for recruitment of Supervisory

Management Non Technical with corresponding salary scale MN-03-

2006-A (P13). The contention that the post of Assistant Cultural

Development Officer was erroneously categorised as Management

Assistants Non Technical Segment 2 and were placed in salary scale

MN-1-2006-A by the NSCC, was founded on the claim that they are

expected to perform multi-functional duties and supervises other

employees. In support of the said contention, learned Presidents

Counsel had listed out different functions the Assistant Cultural

Development Officers are expected to perform, which included

functions related to managing finances, field duties, library

management, supervisory functions and assignment of other duties.

Thus, they contend, the performance of these multiple duties should

satisfy the definition contained in paragraph 3.2 at page 2 of Annexure

II for multi-functional duties and thereby made them entitled to be

placed at the salary scale of MN-03-2006-A.

The Respondents challenged the validity of the said contention,

which meant to impress upon this Court that the said categorisation is

an erroneously made decision by the NSCC. Learned Solicitor General,

in her submissions contended that the fact of assignment of several

duties does not mean the Petitioners are in fact assigned with multi-

functional duties in terms of P.A. Circular No. 6/2006. She further

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

59

submitted that the recommendations made by the Committee

appointed by the 1st Respondent in P16B, did so only upon an

erroneous application of the definition of multi-functional duties in

the said P.A. Circular No. 6/2006 and therefore the NSCC was correct

in rejecting the 1st Respondents recommendations, which in effect was

made based on that report.

If the decision to categorise the Petitioners as Management

Assistants (Non Technical) Segment 1 is found to be made on an

erroneous basis as they claim, then that factor would support the

position that they should have been categorised as Supervisory

Management Assistants. In order to qualify to be categorised as

Supervisory Management Assistants, the Petitioners must satisfy this

Court that they are assigned with multi-functional duties in terms of

the P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, in order to qualify for such a

categorisation.

The Petitioners contend that they possess all four qualifications

referred to above to be categorised as Supervisory Management

Assistants, a claim consistently refuted by the Respondents.

The job description for the post of Assistant Cultural Officer as

contained in the draft SOR prepared by the 1st Respondent in 2006

(27R3D), indicates that the Assistant Cultural Development Officers are

assigned with following functions;

(emphasis added)

What are these supervisory functions that are expected of the

Petitioners?

The approved SOR of 2012 (P10), under its paragraph 4 sets out

the job description of the Assistant Cultural Development Officers are

assigned with. The said paragraph describes 11 different duties. These

duties indicate functions related to library activities, clerical work in

relation to all correspondence, preparation of vouchers, maintaining

attendance registers of students and to act for the Cultural Officer

during his absence. The summary description of the post is described in

the said job description as wkqhqla;j isk ixialD;sl uOHia:dkfha wdh;ksl

It is important to note in this context of the general instructions

issued in terms of P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, in completion of the

Scheme of Recruitment for Management Assistants Non Technical

Segment 2 who are entitled to be placed in the salary scale of MN-1-

2006-A, (55R5A). In the said set of instructions, the general definition

given to Management Assistants Non Technical Segment 2 are as

follows:-

ks,Orhka iska bgqlrkq ,eh hq;=h

It is evident from the above quoted descriptions, the assignment

of official functions to the post of Assistant Cultural Development

Officer are of single functional in terms of the P.A. Circular No. 6/2006,

although they are expected to carry out the functions that are

specifically assigned to them by the relevant appointing authority

(m;alsrS n,Orhd siska fYaIfhka kshu fldg olajk ,o ldhhka fuu

fiajd .Khg wh;a ks,Orhka iska bgqlrkq ,eh hq;=h), which may include

the ones that are referred to in the approved SOR of 2012 (P10), under

paragraph 4. It seemed that the Petitioners had no serious objection to

the said categorisation at that point of time, although they merely stated

in their petition that when they made representations over this issue

and it was promised to rectify same with formulation of the SOR for the

post of Assistant Cultural Development Officers. This was eventually

done in the year 2012.

Then only a Collective of Assistant Cultural Development

Officers made representations to the 1st Respondent by letter dated

17.05.2012 (P16A) registering their protest for the said categorisation

and placement of the impugned salary scale of MN-01-2006. It is stated

therein that when the Assistant Cultural Development Officers were

recruited in the year 2000, their entry qualifications were set well above

the entry qualifications of Management Assistants, but their salary scale

is placed lower to that of the other Management Assistants. It is also

stated that the said grievance is a direct result of their absorption to the

State Management Service. The Committee appointed by the 1st

Respondent, after hearing the trade unions who made representations

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

62

before them, made recommendation to place the Assistant Cultural

Development Officers in the salary scale of MN-03- 2006-A and made a

factually erroneous observation that the Office Assistant and Security

Officer of the Cultural Centres were being supervised by them, in

accepting the Petitioners claim that they do perform supervisory

functions. The Committee further recommended that the SOR should be

amended to reflect the changes they recommend.

In the proposed amendments to SOR (P17), the general job

description for the post of Assistant Cultural Development Officer, re-

categorised as Supervisory Management Assistant Non Technical

(MN-03-2006-A) reads wdh;khkays Odhlfha ldhhkag Wmia:Nl jk fia

uqo,a mrsyrKh wlaIKh yd fufyhq hk lhhka we;=<;a nyqldh (Multi-

Functional) iajrEmfha ldhhka bgqlrk fiajd .Khls. This description is

identical to the one provided in the general guidelines issued to

complete the Scheme of Recruitment to Supervisory Management

Assistants Non Technical (MN-03-2006-A), (55R5C). However, the

functions that are assigned to the said post under the proposed

amended SOR differed from the functions that are already assigned

under the approved SOR (P10), only in respect of two aspects. In

relation to the functions that are associated with the library, the

proposed amended SOR made it the sole responsibility of the Assistant

Cultural Development Officer and in relation to the Office Assistant

and Security Officer, he was expected only to assist the supervision of

minor staff. Clearly, there was no assignment of supervisory function to

the Petitioners even in the said proposed amendment to SOR but only

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

63

an assignment to assist the Cultural Development Officer, in the

supervision of minor staff.

The NSCC, by its letter dated 09.10.2012 rejected the said

proposed amendments to SOR, indicating there was no sufficient

reasons to change its decision to place them in the salary scale MN-1-

2006 (P19). Within a month of the said letter, the 3rd Petitioner and

others lodged a complaint with the HRCSL under reference

HRC/4070/2012 (P20). During the ensuing inquiry before the

Commission, the NSCC provided further reasons for its decision in

P23A, by way of a reply to specific issues that had been raised. In that

letter the NSCC clarified its position that although the Petitioners were

placed initially under TB 2-1, before placing them under MN-1-2006 in

terms of P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, the mere fact of placement of some

others who too were initially under salary scale TB 2-1 in MN-2-2006,

does not make the Petitioners entitled to be placed under the salary

scale MN-2-2006. This is due to the reason that subsequent salary

revisions implemented under different Circulars had introduced

changes in the applicable salary scales and with the implementation of

P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, and it was therefore imperative for the

categorisation of posts/service of the entire Public Service into several

categories as stipulated in that circular.

During the process of re-categorisation, the relevant Ministries

and Departments were expected to take into consideration the

responsibilities that are assigned to each of such posts/services. The

NSCC cites an example to highlight its point by stating that no direct

comparison could be made to the former salary scales to the new set of

salary scales introduced by the P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, by way of a

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

64

particular salary scale corresponding to the former salary scale. As a

result, some of the posts that were placed under the former salary scale

TB 2-1 were subsequently placed under MN-2-2006 while several others

were not. It was further stated by the NSCC that Schedule 1 to P.A.

Circular No. 6/2006 specifically provides under item 6, by stating in

order to be categorised as Supervisory Management Assistants, the

post/service should have G.C.E.(O/L)/(A.L) with supervision

responsibilities as basic qualifications.

Moreover, it is stated in the general instruction to setting up the

Scheme of Recruitment for Management Assistants (Non-Technical)

who are placed in the salary scale MN-3-2006-A (55R5C), they should

perform functions that are classified as wdh;khkays Odhlfha ldhhkag

Wmia:Nl jk fia Odhlh iska ksYa; fldg mjrkq ,nk msrsia md,kh" uqo,a

Ndrldrs;ajh yd uqo,a mrsyrKh wlaIKh yd fufyhq hk lhhka we;=<;a

nyqldh (Multi-Functional) iajrEmfha ldhhka .

It is observed that, in relation to the duties that are connected

with the library of the Cultural Centre, job description P12 expects an

Assistant Cultural Development Officer to carry them out as his

primary function, but that too under the supervision of the Cultural

Officer, who was placed with overall responsibility for the affairs of the

Centre, including its library.

In this context, it is opportune at this stage to consider another

important aspect highlighted by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioners during his submissions. The Petitioners, in their attempt to

establish that they were treated differently to another group of

employees, who are similarly circumstanced as they are, pointed out

that the Postal Services Officers Grade 1B of Segment B of the Unified

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

65

Postal Services, who also have similar entry qualifications and perform

multifunctional duties as the Petitioners, were placed in the higher

salary scale MN-3-2006-A. To illustrate their point, the Petitioners relied

on a paper advertisement inserted by Postmaster General (P15), calling

for applications for the said post by which it is indicated that applicants

to the post of Postal Services Officer - Grade 1B of Segment B, once

appointed, were entitled to be placed in salary scale MN-3-2006-A.

This particular contention of the Petitioners appears to have been

founded on an erroneous assumption regarding the nature of the

criterion employed in the categorisation of posts. It appears that the

Petitioners are under a misapprehension that the entry level educational

qualifications are the sole criterion. Clearly the entry level qualification

is not the sole criterion that is considered for the purpose of

categorisation, but only one among several others. Annexure II of P.A.

Circular No. 6/2006, sets out the multiple criteria that should be

employed for the re-categorisation and re-grouping of posts. Item 1 of

the said Annexure II reads thus;

The categorisation of employees has been based on the

following criteria;

a) Entry Qualifications/Scheme of Recruitment

b) Promotional Procedures

c) Nature of Duties

d) Simplicity

e) Practicability

f) Consistency/Compatibility.

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

66

It may be a fact that when the Petitioners were recruited, their

entry qualifications were comparable to the ones applicable to the

recruitment for the Postal Services Officers. But the subsequent change

of the policy of the Government, implemented through the P.A.

Circular No. 6/2006, had introduced a paradigm shift in the

categorisation of posts in the Public Service by adopting the several

distinct criteria, as set out therein. This particular aspect was recognised

in Padma Akarawita and Others v Dr. Nanda Wickramasinghe and

Others (supra)

Learned Solicitor General highlighted the differences in the entry

qualifications, assignment of responsibilities and instances which

clearly indicate the supervisory character of the duties that are assigned

to Postal Services Officers of Grade 1B of Segment B in the Unified

Postal Service. She thus contended that the two posts could not be

compared and are distinct in all aspects, in terms of the P.A. Circular

No. 6/2006. She relied on the applicable Scheme of Recruitment to the

said post, 55R1.

Perusal of 55R1 and P15 revealed that the entry requirements to

the post of Postal Services Officer - Grade 1B of Segment 2 were that

each applicant must pass six subjects in G.C.E.(O/L) examination in not

more than two attempts and should have at least four credit passes for

subjects including Sinhala/Tamil/English literature and Mathematics.

The applicants also must pass three subjects in G.C.E.(A/L)

examination and, in addition, must be computer literate in a specified

area of a study program which is not less than 720 hours and conferred

by an institution approved by the Tertiary and Vocational Education

Commission.

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

67

In contrast, the entry qualifications for the post of Assistant

Cultural Development Officer in terms of the SOR (P10) and proposed

SOR (P17) are six passes in G.C.E.(O/L) examination in one sitting and

at least a pass in one subject in G.C.E.(A/L) examination. In relation to

professional qualification, an applicant must have either followed a

course in word processing and typewriting in an institution accepted by

Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission or achieved

competency to a similar level.

The comparison referred to above as to the entry requirements

concerns one of the criteria adopted to the categorisation of Supervisory

Management Assistants. That criterion is possession of a skill of a

defined nature at the time of recruitment. The SOR of the Unified Postal

Services (55R1) as well as the advertisement referred to by the

Petitioners, calling for applications for the Unified Postal Services and

in setting out the required qualifications for recruitment for the post of

Postal Services Officer of that service, clearly specifies under the

heading professional qualifications that each applicant must possess a

qualification of a study programme on a specified area, which is of not

less than 720 hours of study, approved by the Tertiary and Vocational

Education Commission. None of the Petitioners nor any of the new

recruits that are to be selected under the SOR (P10) were expected to

fulfil such an entry requirement at the time of recruitment.

It seems that the contention that the SOR (P10) had lowered the

entry level educational qualifications is directly relevant to their

contention based on the claim of differential treatment with the Postal

Services Officers. The Petitioners were recruited with the educational

qualifications (as per P2) and with the approved SOR (P10), the lowered

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

68

entry level qualifications would only apply to new recruits and not to

the Petitioners, who were already confirmed in their service. This was

made on a policy decision to align with the present categorisation of

Assistant Cultural Development Officers with the categorisation of a

Management Assistant Non Technical Segment 2. Even if the said

entry level qualifications on which the Petitioners were recruited are

retained, that factor alone will not qualify the post of Assistant Cultural

Development Officer to be categorised as Supervisory Management

Assistant Non -Technical.

Thus, it seems that the entry qualifications and professional

qualifications that are applicable to the two posts are not comparable.

Even if it is comparable, the Respondents contention is that the

educational qualifications are not the sole criterion considered by the

NSCC in recommending a salary scale to a post or service in terms of

the P.A. Circular No.6/2006, and it is one among five other different

factors that should be taken into consideration. Thus, the perceived

similarity between the entry requirements between the two posts, as

entertained by the Petitioners by placing reliance on entry qualifications

that were applied at the time they were recruited on contract basis with

that of the entry requirement of the Postal Services Officer, would not

advance their cause any further.

This is primarily because, the nature of the duties that are

assigned to an Assistant Cultural Development Officer, a criterion

imposed by Annexure II for re-categorisation of the posts, indicate a

striking dissimilarity between that post and the post of Postal Services

Officer. In the applicable SOR (55R1) to the Postal Services Officers, the

definition of functions to the said post is stated as follows;

It is clear from the list of functions reproduced above from the

relevant SOR, the post of Postal Services Officer is placed as the senior

most officer who is placed in charge of a Post Office and is expected to

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

70

supervise its sales, accounts, financial, transactions, communications,

staff, sorting of postal items and their custody. The term wlaIKh

appears in three specific instances, in addition to placing the

responsibility of overall supervision of the Post Office and its entire

staff on the Postal Services Officer and thus conceding to the

supervisory nature of the functions in the definition section itself.

The document containing the assignment duties to the post of

Assistant Cultural Development Officer (P12) lists out following duties;

It is very evident from the considerations that are referred to

above, the attempt made by the Petitioners to compare themselves with

the post of Postal Services Officers in support of their contention that

they were treated unequally when compared with others who are

similarly circumstanced should necessarily fail for the reason that the

very nature of functions that are assigned to Postal Services Officers are

clearly of supervisory in nature in terms of the P.A. Circular No.6/2006,

whereas the functions that are assigned to the Petitioners are not.

When the nature of responsibilities of the Postal Services Officer

is compared with that of Assistant Cultural Development Officers, in

relation to the applicable salary scale, the 27th Respondent states at

paragraph 39(e) in his Statement of Objections that prior to

implementation of the Government policy reflected in the P.A. Circular

No. 6/2006, the applicable circular in relation to determination of the

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

72

salary scale was Public Administration Circular No. 9/2004. In terms of

said circular, the Petitioners were absorbed into Public Service in 2006,

and were placed on the salary scale of TB-2-1 ( Rs. 101, 880 14X1,320

6X1,160 129,720), whereas the officers of the Public Management

Assistants Service, had already been placed at a higher salary scale of

TB 2-2 (Rs. 108,480 9X1,320 8X1,560 134,500). The Petitioners

merely denied this statement of the 27th Respondent by paragraph 45 of

their counter affidavit. They only reiterated their claim that they

perform both supervisory functions and multiple duties but did not

make any specific statement as to applicable salary scale to the post of

Assistant Cultural Development Officers in terms of the Public

Administration Circular No. 9/2004, contradicting the 27th

Respondents position.

Since the Petitioners grievance over the categorisation and salary

scale is founded on the claims that they perform multi-functional and

supervisory duties, it is of interest to peruse Annexure III to P.A.

Circular No. 6/2006, to have a general overview as to the other posts

that are placed in salary scale of MN- 01- 2006-A with the Petitioners

along with the posts that had been placed in the salary scale of MN-03-

2006.

The posts of Sub Post Masters, Welfare Officers, Co-operative

Inspectors, Court Clerks, Court Interpreters, Court Stenographers,

Court Typists and Grama Niladhari Class I are placed in the salary scale

of MN- 01- 2006-A, whereas officers of the Unified Postal Service Group

A Grade III Segment B, Group B, Grade I and Grade II are placed in the

salary scale of MN-03-2006, along with Station Master of Supra Grade,

Class I and II, and Librarians (non-graduates).

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

73

Learned Solicitor General, in her submissions contended that the

fact of assignment of several duties does not by itself make the

Petitioners as Public Officers who are assigned with multi-functional

duties in terms of P.A. Circular No. 6/2006 and the Index to Salary

Conversion seem to indicate that it had been the underlying rationale

adopted uniformly by the NSCC in the determination of salary

conversions between posts that are placed in salary scales MN-01-2006

and MN-3-2006.

Thus, the NSCC in determining not to accept the proposed

Scheme of Recruitment (P17) not only considered the nature of duties, a

criterion set out by P.A. Circular No. 6/2006, that are assigned to the

post of Assistant Cultural Development Officers, but also considered

and applied the other different criteria as well, as the 27th Respondent

avers in his Statement of Objections.

In view of the foregoing, it is evident that the 3rd Petitioner failed

to establish that the impugned decision made by the NSCC (P19) to

reject the proposed amended Scheme of Recruitment (P17)

recommended by the 1st Respondent by his letter dated 21.09.2012 (P18),

was not made on the scheme set out by the set of guidelines that had

been laid down in the P.A. Circular No. 6/2006 as amended in the re-

categorisation of the post of Assistant Cultural Development Officer

and in the determination of the applicable salary conversion.

Since the scope of this application is to consider whether the

rejection of the proposed Scheme of Recruitment (P17) to amend the

existing Scheme of Recruitment (P10) is violative of the fundamental

right to equality of the 3rd Petitioner, it is very relevant to refer to the

pronouncement made by Sripavan CJ in Disanayake and Others v

S.C. (FR) Application No. 298/2013

74

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs and

Others (2015) 1 Sri L.R. 362. His Lordship stated (at p. 367) that [A]

scheme of recruitment once formulated is not good forever, it is perfectly within

the competence of the appropriate authority to change it, rechange it, adjust it

and re-adjust it according to the compulsions of changing circumstances. The

Court cannot give directions as to how the Public Service Commission should

function except to state the obligation not to act arbitrarily and to treat

employees who are similarly situated equally Once the Public Service

Commission lays down a scheme, it has to follow it uniformly.

In the judgment of Gunaratne and Others v Ceylon Petroleum

Corporation and Others (1996) 1 Sri L.R. 315, Fernando J stated (at p.

324) in relation to Article 12 of the Constitution that it prohibits

arbitrary, capricious and/or discriminatory action.

The basis on which the NSCC decided not to accept the proposed

amended Scheme of Recruitment for the post of Assistant Cultural

Development Officers indicative from the contents of the letter P19,

which states;

Tn wud;HdxYfha ;k;=re j, n|jd .ekSf mrsmd ms<sn|j g

Therefore, it is my considered view that the impugned decision in

P19, cannot be termed as an arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory

decision, and it did not discriminate among persons who are similarly

circumstanced.

costs, along with the petitions of the other Petitioners, whose grievances

are time barred.
