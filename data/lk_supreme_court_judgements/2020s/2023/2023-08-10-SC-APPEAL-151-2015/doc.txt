Argued on: 02.12.2022 Decided on: 10.08.2023 Janak De Silva J.

This appeal arises out of a partition action. There is no dispute as to the identity of the

corpus. On the title dispute there was some common ground between Plaintiff-

Respondent-Respondent (Plaintiff) and the 1st to 4th and 9th Defendant-Appellant-

Appellants (Appellants).

According to them the original owner of the corpus was Keppetiwalana Ralalage Pabilis

Appuhamy. It was also admitted that Pabilis Appuhamy by Deed of Transfer No. 29739

dated 14.05.1933 transferred the corpus in equal undivided shares to one Manchanayake

Arachchilage Jamis Appuhamy and one Manchanayake Arachchige Podisingho. The title

dispute between the Plaintiff and Appellants was on the devolution of title from the said

Manchanayake Arachchilage Jamis Appuhamy and said Manchanayake Arachchige

Podisingho.

According to the Plaintiff, Jamis Appuhamy by Deed of Transfer No. 275 dated 23.06.1939

(1.1) transferred his undivided share of the corpus back to Pabilis Appuhamy.

Thereafter Pablis Appuhamy by Deed of Transfer No. 17754 dated 17.11.1971 (1.2)

transferred this undivided share of the corpus to his grandchildren, the 1st to 4th

Appellants. They are the children of the 9th Appellant and Keppetiwalana Ralalage

Wijedasa, a son of Pabilis Appuhamy. Thus, according to the Plaintiff each of the 1st to 4th

Appellants became entitled to an undivided 1/8th share of the corpus. Nevertheless, the

Appellants contend that Keppetiwalana Ralalage Dharmadasa, another son of Pabilis

Appuhamy has prescribed to the entire corpus through long and undisturbed possession

adverse to the other co-owners.

Page 6 of 12

The title dispute between the Plaintiff and the Appellants on one side and the 5th to 8(a),

8(b) and 8(c) Defendant-Respondent-Respondents (Respondents) on the other side

revolved on whether Pabilis Appuhamy was the only son of Keppetiwalana Ralalage Akalis

Appuhamy. According to the Plaintiff and the Appellants, Pabilis Appuhamy was the sole

son of Akalis Appuhamy and inherited the corpus from Akalis Appuhamy. Nonetheless,

according to the Respondents, Akalis Appuhamy had another son called Keppetiwalana

Ralalage Juwanis Appuhamy. Hence, Pabilis Appuhamy and Juwanis Appuhamy each

inherited an undivided share of the corpus from Akalis Appuhamy.

The learned Additional District Judge accepted the pedigree claimed by the 8th

Respondent and rendered judgment accordingly. The Appellants' prescriptive claim was

denied. The appeal to the Civil Appellate High Court of the Western Province (holden in

Gampaha) by the Appellants was dismissed.

Leave to appeal has been granted on the following questions of law:

1. Have the Hon. High Court Judges as well as the District Judge erred in law by basing

the judgment on the purported pedigree of the 8th Defendant-Respondent-

Respondent which has not beens proved at all during the course of the trial on the

contrary the 8th Defendant-Respondent-Respondent contradicted himself with

regard to the purported original ownership relied upon by him in arriving at his

said conclusion?

2. Have the Hon. High Court Judges as well as the learned District Judge erred in law

by granting an undivided half share of the property whereas the 8th Defendant-

Respondent-Respondent by the Statement of Claim dated 04.09.1986 in fact only

sought to obtain undivided 1/6th of the said property in arriving at their final

conclusion?

Page 7 of 12

3. The Hon. High Court Judges as well as the learned District Judge totally failed to

consider the prescriptive possession of these Petitioners backed by their title

deeds in arriving at their final conclusion?

4. Have the Hon. High Court Judges as well as the learned District Judge erred in law

by failing to evaluate the evidence led by the parties at the trial with regard to the

actual devolution of title of the property in a suit and prescriptive claims made by

the Petitioners and also the other Respondents in arriving at their final conclusion?

Inheritance

The plaint claimed that Pabilis Appuhamy acquired the corpus through a long and

undisturbed possession. This is the position taken up by the Appellants as well. Neither

party has provided any evidence to support this position.

On the contrary there is evidence that Pabilis Appuhamy inherited an undivided share of

the corpus from Akalis Appuhamy. Under cross-examination the Plaintiff admitted to

being the daughter of Podisingho, a son of Pabilis Appuhamy. According to the Plaintiff,

Pabilis Appuhamy by Deed of Transfer No. 29739 dated 14.05.1933 transferred the corpus

in equal undivided shares to Manchanayake Arachchilage Jamis Appuhamy and

Podisingho.

In Suhumaran v. Sathiyaseelan [S.C. Appeal No. 28/2017, S.C.M. 04.10.2021] I held that

the probative value of the contents of a recital in a deed depends on the facts and

circumstances of each case. Although it is mentioned in the proceedings that a photocopy

of Deed of Transfer No. 29739 was produced marked as .1, it cannot be found in the

brief. Nevertheless, the Plaintiff was cross examined on the contents of .1 and she

admitted that the recital therein states that Pabilis Appuhamy obtained title to the corpus

through inheritance from his father Akalis Appuhamy and his mother Helena.

Page 8 of 12

In the absence of the marked deed . 1 in the brief, I am of the view that there is no

legal impediment to the Court considering the evidence on record given by the Plaintiff

on the contents of the recital therein. Given the relationship between Podisingho and

Pabilis Appuhamy, I have no hesitation in accepting this evidence of the facts and

circumstances of the case.

The fact that Akalis Appuhamy died intestate is further corroborated by the recital in deed

marked (8.1) wherein Helena states that she is transferring the rights, to another

land, which she derived from marriage inheritance. Moreover, documents marked

8.2and 8.3 (plaints of two partition actions instituted by the 8th Respondent in

relation to partition of other property belonging to Akalis Appuhamy) establish the fact

that Pabilis Appuhamy and Juwanis Appuhamy were sons of Akalis Appuhamy. In fact, the

Plaintiff accepted under cross-examination that Juwanis Appuhamy was also entitled to

his share of the corpus on the death of Akalis Appuhamy. Accordingly, I am of the view

that the 8th Respondent has proved that both Pablis Appuhamy and Juwanis Appuhamy

inherited an undivided share each of the corpus from Akalis Appuhamy.

The Appellants strenuously contended that no share of the corpus should be granted to

the 8th Respondent as neither he nor his predecessors were ever in possession of the

corpus. The short answer to this point is that a co-owners possession is in law the

possession of all the other co-owners. Every co-owner is presumed to be in possession in

his capacity as a co-owner.

Accordingly, I answer the first question of law in the negative.

The Appellants contend that nevertheless, the 8th Respondent failed to prove the

devolution of title of Juwanis Appuhamy to him. In particular, it was contended that

Juwanis Appuhmay had three children, namely Keppetiwalana Ralalage Jayaratne (8th

Respondent), Keppetiwalana Ralalage Jayatilleke and Keppetiwalana Ralalage Helena.

Page 9 of 12

Hence, if at all the 8th Respondent is only entitled to an undivided 1/6th share of the

corpus. In fact, the 8th Respondent in his statement of claim only claimed an undivided

1/6th share of the corpus. However, the learned Additional District Judge granted the 8th

Respondent an undivided share of the corpus.

Admittedly notices were sent by the District Court to Keppetiwalana Ralalage Jayatilleke

and Keppetiwalana Ralalage Helena. They did not come forward. Nevertheless, it is the

bounden duty of the trial judge in a partition action to fully investigate the title to the

corpus. The law does not permit him to allocate shares to a claimant merely because the

other parties who are entitled to undivided shares do not make a claim in the partition

action. In Ismail Lebbe v. Haniffa (51 N.L.R. 299 at 301) it was held that if no party is able

to establish to the satisfaction of the Court that a co-owner is alive or, if he is dead, who

his heirs are, his share would remain unallotted and the Court will proceed to enter a

partition decree in respect of the remaining shares among other co-owners. In Yoosuf

and Others v. Muttaliph (13 C.L.Rec. 171) it was held that where such a portion of the

corpus is left unallotted, the title to this unallotted lot remains in the original co-owners

and that title is in no respect affected by the partition decree. I am of the opinion that

both the District Court and the High Court were mistaken in their decision to grant the 8th

Respondent an undivided share of the corpus. The 8th Respondent is only entitled to an

undivided 1/6th share of the corpus.

Therefore, I answer question of law No. 2 in the affirmative.

Prescription

The 1st to 4th Appellants are the children of Keppetiwalana Ralalage Dharmadasa, a son of

Pabilis Appuhamy. The 9th Appellant is the widow of Keppetiwalana Ralalage Dharmadasa.

The Appellants claim that from around 1955 Keppetiwalana Ralalage Dharmadasa was in

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the entirety of the corpus in a manner that

Page 10 of 12

was adverse to the rights of aforementioned Podisingho and all those who claim the title

through him. Consequently, they claim to have obtained title to the corpus.

The 9th Appellant's testimony shows that she got married to Dharmadasa in 1954 and

acquired possession of the corpus in 1955. Nevertheless, the evidence in this case

indicates that the corpus was co-owned property by then.

In Tillekeratne v. Bastian (21 N.L.R. 12) it was held that in order to acquire prescriptive

title a co-owner should prove exclusive possession for ten years after changing the nature

of the possession to one of adverse title to the others.

Furthermore, the Appellants and the parties they claim prescriptive rights against are

related. In De Silva v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (80 N.L.R. 292 at 295-6)

Sharvananda J. (As he was then) held:

The principle of law is well established that a person who bases his title in adverse

possession must show by clear and unequivocal evidence that his possession was

hostile to the real owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property

claimed. In order to constitute adverse possession, the possession must be in denial

of the title of the true owner. The acts of the person in possession should be

irreconcilable with the rights of the true owner; the person in possession must claim

to be so as of right as against the true owner. Where there is no hostility to or denial

of the title of the true owner there can be no adverse possession. In deciding

whether the alleged acts of the person constitute adverse possession, regard must

be had to the animus of the person doing those acts, and this must be ascertained

from the facts and circumstances of each case and the relationship of the parties.

Possession which may be presumed to be adverse in the case of a stranger may

not attract such a presumption, in the case of persons standing in certain social

or legal relationships.(Emphasis added)

Page 11 of 12

Let me now examine the evidence presented by the Appellants against these principles.

The 9th Appellant's claim was that her husband Dharmadasa paid taxes for the corpus.

This testimony has been corroborated by retired agrarian officer P.A.S. Sumanasiri.

Nevertheless, in Hassan v. Romanishamy (66 C.L.W. 112) Basnayake C.J. held that the

payment of rates is by itself not proof of possession for the purpose of section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance, for rates can be tendered by a tenant or one occupying any

premises with the leave and license of the owner or by any other person. This statement

was cited with approval in Sirajudeen and Others v. Abbas [(1994) 2 Sri. L. R. 365].

Gamaralalage Joseph Perera, a friend of Dharmadasa, testified that Dharmadasa and the

Appellants resided in the house built on the corpus. However, he stated that he is

unaware as to who enjoyed the produce of the corpus or whether anyone else was in

possession of or could claim title to the corpus. Gunapala Jayawardane, who is related to

the 9th Appellant, lived in the house built on the corpus with Dharmadasa and the 9th

Appellant from 1955 to 1978. He testified that Dharmadasa and the 9th Appellant were

the only ones who had possession of the corpus and were the only ones who cultivated

the corpus. However, during cross-examination on behalf of the Plaintiff, he admitted

that Wijedasa frequently visited the corpus until his death in 1980 and that he is unaware

whether Wijedasa was given a portion of the produce from the corpus.

H.S.A.P. Peris, a Deputy Provincial Director of the Department of Agriculture was called

to prove documents 8.12 to 8.15. He testified that these documents were issued

by the Department of Agriculture allowing Dharmadasa and the 9th Appellant to cultivate

specific types of crops on a land called Ambagahalanda.

Nevertheless, as pointed out earlier, every co-owner is presumed to be possessing the

corpus in his capacity as a co-owner. One co-owner cannot put an end to such possession

by any secret intention in his mind. It is only "ouster" or something equivalent to "ouster"

which could bring about that result. The evidence in this case does not establish any such

Page 12 of 12

ouster. The ouster was established only in December 1983 when the Appellants

obstructed the possession of the Plaintiff and her children. This partition action was filed

by the Plaintiff in November 1984.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the learned Additional District Judge and the Civil

Appellate High Court judges were correct in rejecting the prescriptive claim of the

Appellants for the whole corpus.

Accordingly, question of law Nos. 3 and 4 are answered in the negative.

Based on the answer given to the question of law No. 2, I vary the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge and allocate an undivided 1/6th share of the corpus to the 8th

Respondent. Another 2/6th share of the corpus should be left unallotted.

The learned District Judge of Gampaha is directed to enter an interlocutory decree in

accordance with this judgment. If the interlocutory decree has already been entered, it

should be amended in accordance with the judgment of the Court.

The parties shall bear the costs of this appeal.

The appeal is partly allowed.
