Janak De Silva, J.

The Petitioner owns a parcel of land that is situated in Rattanapitiya, Boralesgamuwa

and facing the Pamankada-Horana main road. According to the Petitioner this is the

sole residential property owned by him. The State acquired two portions of the same

parcel of land on two separate occasions for road development.

Page 5 of 13

The factual circumstances of the two acquisitions are as follows.

A section 2 notice under the Land Acquisition Act (Act) dated 08.04.2008 (9R1) was

published asserting that land was required for the public purpose of widening of

Colombo Horana Highway [] under the National Highways Sector Project. On

06.02.2012, a section 5 notice under the Act (9R2) was published reflecting the

decision of the Minister of Lands, inter alia, that Lot No. EF depicted in the Advance

Tracing bearing No. CO/KSB/2008/198 (9R3) was required for the said public purpose.

On 19.02.2013, an order (9R4) was made in terms of section 38 (a) of the Act (9R4).

The notice in terms of section 7 of the Act (9R5) was published on 08.05.2013.

On 27.05.2013, an inquiry was held in terms of section 9 of the Act with the

participation of the Petitioner. A decision in terms of section 10(1)(a) of the Act (9R8)

was made accepting the claim of the Petitioner in respect of Lot No. 1 depicted in Plan

bearing No. 9332 subject to the life interest of the mother of the Petitioner. On

10.03.2014, an award in terms of section 17 (1) of the Act (9R9) was made awarding a

sum of Rs. 2,840,000/- as compensation for the acquisition of 2.29 perches.

Subsequently, the Petitioner preferred an appeal to the Land Acquisition Board of

Review. Later, the Petitioner made an appeal to the Ministerial Committee as reflected

in document marked P17. Upon considering the appeal, the Land Acquisition and

Resettlement Committee (LARC), increased the compensation to Rs. 4,070,041/-.

This decision was later affirmed by the Ministerial Compensation Appeal Board

(SUPER LARC). The Petitioner refused to accept the said compensation along with

the ex-gratia payment of Rs. 500,000/- claiming that he found the proposed

compensation insufficient and that he wanted to seek an enhancement of the

proposed compensation. The State has taken possession of the said portion of land.

Page 6 of 13

In the second acquisition, a section 2 notice under the Act was published on

12.12.2013 for the same public purpose, namely widening of the Pamankada-Horana

Road. A section 38 (a) order under the Act was published on 05.05.2014, covering 1.38

perches of land belonging to the Petitioner. On 08.02.2017 and 19.04.2017 respectively

steps were taken to publish notices in terms of Sections 5 and 7 of the Act. On

08.05.2017, an inquiry in terms of section 9 of the Act was held with the participation

of the Petitioner. The Petitioners claim to the said land was accepted in terms of

section 10 (1) (a) of the Act in the decision marked 9R26 dated 16.05.2017. On

03.10.2017, an award in terms of section 17 (1) of the Act was made awarding Rs.

1,496,500.00 as compensation. This was subsequently increased to Rs. 3,235,750.00

by LARC and to Rs. 4,623,875.00 by SUPER LARC. The State has taken possession of this

portion as well.

Hence, a total sum of Rs. 8,693,916.00 has been determined to be paid as

compensation to the Petitioner for the acquisition of a total of 3.64 perches of land.

The Petitioner has thus far refused to accept this amount.

Leave to proceed has been granted under Articles 12(1), 12(2) and 14(1)(g) of the

Constitution.

The Petitioner is seeking the following reliefs:

1. Declaration of an infringement and/or continuing violation of the Petitioners

fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 12 (1) and/or 12 (2) and/or 14 (g)

of the Constitution by the 1st 10th Respondents; and,

2. A direction that the 1st 10th Respondents pay compensation to the Petitioner

for the acquisitions together without any delay.

Articles 12 (1) and 12(2)

Article 12(1) of the Constitution encompasses two distinct principles. The negative

concept is that all individuals are equal before the law and that no one should be

treated differently. The positive concept is that all individuals are entitled to equal

protection of the law, which requires them to be treated equally in similar

circumstances.

The negative concept requires the application of the law to everyone. No one is

entitled to be treated differently, except where the law recognises a specific exemption

to its application such as Articles 12(4), 15(7) and 15(8) of the Constitution. Any act

which contravenes the law will violate the rule of law embedded in Article 12(1).

In C. W. Mackie and Company Ltd. v. Hugh Molagoda, Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue and others [(1986) 1 Sri L.R. 300 at page 309] Sharvananda C.J. held

that:

[] [T]he equal treatment guaranteed by Article 12 is equal treatment in the

performance of a lawful act. Via Article 12, one cannot seek the execution of any

illegal or invalid act. Fundamental to this postulate of equal treatment is that it

should be referable to the exercise of a valid right, founded in law in

contradistinction to an illegal right which is invalid in law. (Emphasis added)

This decision was quoted with approval in Farook v. Dharmaratne, Chairman,

Provincial Public Service Commission, Uva and Others [(2005) 1 Sri L.R. 133 at 140]

where Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake C.J. observed that:

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution does not provide for any situation where the

authorities will have to act illegally. The safeguard retained in Article 12 (1) is for

the performance of a lawful act and not to be directed to carry out an illegal

function. In order to succeed the petitioner must be in a position to place material

Page 8 of 13

before this Court that there has been unequal treatment within the framework of a

lawful act. (Emphasis added)

Therefore, where there is an allegation of a violation of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution, it is incumbent on the Petitioner to, inter alia, establish that the

Respondent will not have to act contrary to law in providing the relief sought by the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner does not challenge the legality of the acquisition of the two parcels of

land. In fact, he makes a laudable assertion that he did not challenge the acquisition in

the public interest. His grievance is that the compensation paid for the two acquisitions

is inadequate as it was calculated based on the acquisition having been made on two

different dates. The Petitioner contends that he is entitled in law to have the

authorities calculate the compensation assuming the two acquisitions were done

together and not independently.

In this context, I have to examine the basis on which compensation is calculated in

terms of the Act.

Part VI of the Act deals with compensation. Section 46 of the Act deals with the

"market value" of the land or servitude that is to be acquired for the stated public

purpose. Section 45 of the Act specifies the factors that must be taken into account

when determining the market value for compensation assessment.

It states that this market value refers to the value specified in section 7 of the Act. This

position is clearly defined in the Act, but it has been reaffirmed in C.E.A Perera v. The

Assistant Government Agent, Kaluthara (74 N.L.R. 130), where Weeramantry, J. held:

Section 45 (1) of the Land Acquisition Ordinance (Cap. 460) provides that the

market value of a land for the purposes of that Ordinance shall be the amount

which the land might be expected to have realized if sold by a willing seller in

Page 9 of 13

the open market as a separate entity on the date of publication of notice under

Section 7. (Emphasis added)

It is evident that the market value of the land acquired must be determined on the

date of the notice under section 7 of the Act. The section 7 notices for the two

acquisitions were published on two different dates, 08.05.2013 and 19.04.2017. Thus,

the market value of the two portions of land must be determined based on those two

different dates on which the section 7 notices were made although acquired for the

same public purpose. There is no provision in the Act to apply one date to both

acquisitions.

The State has followed the provisions of the Act when calculating the compensation.

The Petitioner is asking the State to determine the compensation for the two portions

of land acquired in the two different days, assuming they were done on the same day.

That basis may lead to the Petitioner receiving a higher compensation. Nevertheless,

the existing law does not permit the Court to order such a course of action.

Court is certainly exercising just and equitable jurisdiction in terms of Article 126(4) of

the Constitution. In Noble Resources International Pte Limited v. Hon. Ranjith

Siyambalapitiya, Minister of Power and Renewable Energy and Others [S.C. FR No.

394/2015, S.C.M. 24.06.2016] The Court issued directives pursuant to Article 126(4)

even if no violation of a fundamental right has been established. However, the Court

cannot under the guise of just and equitable jurisdiction enshrined in Article 126(4) of

the Constitution grant any remedy which requires any person to act contrary to law.

I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish any violation of Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. Moreover, the Court cannot direct the State to calculate compensation

assuming both acquisitions were done on the same day as it would require the State

to act contrary to law.

Furthermore, the Petitioner has failed to show that he was discriminated in calculating

the compensation contrary to Article 12(2).

Page 10 of 13

Article 14 (1) (g)

The petitioner contends that he and his wife were forced to cease their self-

employment of supplying readymade garments because of the lack of space in their

residence after the acquisition.

Article 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution states that [e]very citizen is entitled to the

freedom to engage by himself or in association with others in any lawful occupation,

profession, trade, business or enterprise.

The right to engage in any lawful trade or profession is infringed if that right is restricted

contrary to law. [W.M.K. De Silva v. Chairman, Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation (1989) 2

Sri L. R. 393 at pages 407-408, Nuwan Chathuranga Padmasiri and Others v. C.D.

Wickremaratne and Others (S.C. (F/R) No. 46/2021, S.C.M. 23.11.2022)].

Moreover, the fundamental right to engage in a trade or business, must be read

together with Articles 15 (5), 15 (7) and 15 (8) which demonstrate that Article 14 (1)

(g) is not an unrestricted fundamental right.

Specifically, Article 15 (5) states that:

15 (5). The exercise and operation of the fundamental right declared and recognized

by Article 14 (1) (g) shall be subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed by law

in the interests of national economy or in relation to

(a) the professional, technical, academic, financial and other qualifications necessary

for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation, trade, business or

enterprise and the licensing and disciplinary control of the person entitled to such

fundamental right; and

(b) the carrying on by the State, a State agency or a public corporation of any trade,

business, industry, service or enterprise whether to the exclusion, complete or

partial, of citizens or otherwise. (Emphasis added)

Page 11 of 13

In Licensing of Produce Brokers Bill [Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary

Bills, 1978-1983 (Vol. I), page 32], it was observed that Article 15 (5) restrictions are

permitted only in accordance with law. Restrictions over an individuals employment

shall be permitted in the interest of the general public [Jeshingbhai v. Emperor AIR

1950 Bombay 363 at page 367].

Road transport is a significant part of economic activity, particularly in developing

countries like Sri Lanka. Although it may be difficult to quantify in economic terms, the

contribution of transport for national development, there is no doubt that developed

road network plays an indispensable role in providing access to a myriad of economic

activity including health, education and facilitating markets for economic growth.

Admittedly, the impugned acquisition has been made for a road widening project. The

Petitioner in paragraph 14 of the affidavit dated 12.10.2016 states that he did not

intend to stand in the way of the said road widening project considering the national

importance of the same. The national importance of the project is thus conceded.

Nevertheless, any restriction on the right to engage by himself or in association with

others in any lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise must be

reasonable and proportionate to the object sought to be achieved. Such restrictions

would not be reasonable if they arbitrarily and excessively invade the freedom of

individuals [Chintamoan Rao v. State of M.P. AIR 1951 SC 118; Rashid Ahmed v.

Municipal Board, Kairana AIR 1950 SC 163].

I observe that the State has in this instance resorted to a least intrusive approach in

the acquisition of land in the instant case by first acquiring a portion which was

deemed to be absolutely necessary for the stated public purpose. The second

acquisition followed sometime thereafter.

Page 12 of 13

Moreover, in Elmore Perera v. Major Montague Jayawickrema, Minister of Public

Administration and Plantation Industries [(1985) 1 Sri. L. R. 285 at 323] Sharvananda,

C. J. held that the discontinuance of a job or employment in which any person is

engaged in does not by itself infringe his fundamental right to carry on an occupation

or profession which is guaranteed under Article 14 (1) (g) of the Constitution. Despite

the claim of discontinuance of self-employment by the Petitioner, attachment marked

P26(iv) shows that the Petitioner, at the time of filing this action, continued to engage

in his employment, albeit somewhat restrictively for lack of space, and hence, the

Petitioner was not completely deprived of his ability to engage in his trade or business.

In any event, the Respondents have factored in the employment of the Petitioner and

the impact the acquisition had on it when compensation was calculated. In the final

determination of the SUPER LARC dated 12.05.2015 marked as P35, that part has been

addressed as in the computation of Rs. 4,070,041/=.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish any

violation of Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Before parting with this judgment, I wish to draw attention to a shortcoming in the Act

that must be corrected. The comity between the legislature and the judiciary requires

the Court to draw the attention of the legislature to situations where a lacuna in the

law prevents the Court from remedying an injustice. The State has chosen a less

intrusive method of acquiring land for the project's development by doing it in two

stages. This is in line with the principle of proportionality mentioned earlier and should

be encouraged to be followed in future acquisitions as well. The Act does not provide

for the compensation to be calculated equitably in such a situation, given the

provisions in section 7.

Page 13 of 13

The attention of the legislature is drawn to this deficiency in order to examine an

appropriate amendment to the relevant provisions to provide for equitable

compensation in similar situations.

The application is dismissed without costs.
