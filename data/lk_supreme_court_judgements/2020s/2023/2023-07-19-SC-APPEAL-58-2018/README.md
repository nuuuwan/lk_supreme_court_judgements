Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff filed this action against the defendant in the District Court

of Matale seeking a declaration of title to the land described in the

schedule to the plaint and a declaration that the defendants title deed

No. 1711 is a forgery. Conversely, the defendant sought a declaration of

title to the same land and a declaration that the plaintiffs title deed No.

275 is a forgery. At the trial, paragraphs 2-5 of the plaint were recorded

as admissions, i.e., Atipola Kiri Banda Karunaratne was the original

owner of the land; he transferred his rights by deed No. 1451 to four

persons including Heen Banda Atipola; the other three persons later

transferred their rights to the said Heen Banda Atipola by deed No.

10601; and Heen Banda Atipola by deed No. 183 dated 01.02.1997 gifted

the land to Bandaranayake. Both parties accept that the said deed of gift

No. 183 was later revoked by Heen Banda Atipola. The fact that Heen

Banda Atipola was at one time the owner of this land was admitted by

both parties. The real issue was whether Heen Banda Atipola transferred

the land to the plaintiff by deed No. 275 or whether he transferred the

land to the defendant by deed No. 1711. In the event the Court decided

that the forgery was not proved, the defendant alternatively claimed

priority by registration of his deed in the correct folio despite his deed

having been executed after the deed of the plaintiff.

SC/APPEAL/58/2018

However, during the course of leading evidence in the defendants case,

a further issue was raised by the defendant on the basis that by judgment

delivered on 10.06.2009 in case No. CA/1152/98 marked V3 (page 542

of the brief), the Court of Appeal had come to the conclusion that the

aforementioned deed No. 1451 attested by a notary public, namely T.M.A.

Sally, is null and void since the notarial licence of Mr. Sally had not been

extended at the time of execution of the deed and therefore both parties

to the present case cannot derive title from Heen Banda Atipola.

The Court of Appeal concluded that According to the evidence of Malani

Perera an official of the High Court of Kandy, the notarial license of T.M.A.

Sally who executed the deed No. 1451 of 11.04.1978 had not been

extended beyond 22.02.1978. Accordingly Mr. T.M.A. Sally was not a

notary public on the date he attested the deed No. 1451 which was marked

V1 at the trial. But according to the judgment of the District Court

marked V8 (page 580 of the brief), witness Malani Pereras evidence is

that notary Sally had a valid licence at the time of the execution of deed

No. 1451. The evidence is not available in the brief. The Court of Appeal

in its judgment has not explained why the finding of the District Court in

that regard is wrong. In any event, as I will explain below, even if the

notarial licence has not been extended, the notary does not cease to be a

notary and the deeds executed during that period do not become invalid

ipso facto.

The Court of Appeal in the said judgment (page 543) also states that the

aforesaid Etipola Kiribanda Karunaratne died on 28.04.1978 leaving a

last will whereby this property was bequeathed to Chandrasena

Karunaratne who transferred the same to the plaintiff in that case by

deed No. 4151 dated 31.12.1984. According to the judgment of the Court

of Appeal, the deed had been tendered for the first time to the Court of

Appeal. The Court of Appeal has accepted that position despite there

5

SC/APPEAL/58/2018

being no indication that the said last will was proved before a court of

law and admitted to probate.

Ultimately the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the District

Court which was in favour of the defendant-respondent in that case on

the submissions made by counsel for the defendant-respondent himself.

This is very unusual. The Court of Appeal states: Upon submission made

before this Court by the counsel for the defendant-respondent it is

contended that the deed No. 4151 marked as X conveys title to the

plaintiff/appellant. And the deed No. 1451 attested by T.M.A. Sally

11.04.1978 conveys no title to the defendant-respondents. Accordingly we

allow the appeal and grant the reliefs prayed by the plaintiff-appellant in

the amended plaint dated 10.03.1992. Unless there is collusion, it is

hard to believe that the defendant-respondent, in favour of whom

judgment has been entered, would make submissions on appeal in

support of their opponent.

The subject matter of this case and the aforesaid Court of Appeal case is

the same. The defendant in this case is the substituted defendant in the

Court of Appeal case. But the plaintiffs are different. The application for

intervention in the Court of Appeal case by the plaintiff in the instant

case was refused by the Court of Appeal in view of the objections raised

by the plaintiff-appellant and the substituted defendant in the Court of

Appeal case, the latter being, as I have already stated, the defendant in

this case (vide V4 at page 545).

The judgment of the Court of Appeal is not binding on the plaintiff in the

instant action inter alia because he was not a party to the said (in my

view, collusive) appeal.

6

SC/APPEAL/58/2018

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book The Law of Evidence, Vol I, 2nd

Edition (1989), at pages 528-529 states that in order to establish a plea

of res judicata, the following constituents must be established:

(i) the former action must have been a regular action;

(ii) the two actions must be between the same parties or their

representatives in interest (privies);

(iii) the previous decision must be what in law is deemed such;

(iv) the particular judicial decision must have been in fact

pronounced as alleged;

(v) the previous judgment must be a final judgment;

(vi) the same question or identical causes of action must have been

involved in both actions;

(vii) the judicial tribunal pronouncing the decision must have had

competent jurisdiction in that behalf;

(viii) the judgment should not have been obtained by fraud or

collusion;

(ix) if it is a foreign judgment, it should have been passed in

accordance with the principles of natural justice.

The learned author adds that the correctness of the decision is not a

relevant consideration.

After a lengthy trial before the District Court on several contentious

issues, which commenced on 27.03.2006 and ended on 28.06.2012,

spanning over six years, the District Court by judgment dated 23.01.2013

dismissed the plaintiffs action as well as the defendants cross claim

stating that the District Court is bound by the judgment of the Court of

Appeal on the doctrine of stare decisis. In view of that finding, the District

Court did not answer the real issues raised by both parties over which

voluminous evidence was led at the trial. The District Court merely

7

SC/APPEAL/58/2018

concluded that answering those contentious issues does not arise in view

of the Court of Appeal judgment.

On appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal of Kandy affirmed the judgment

of the District Court and dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff is before this

Court against the judgment of the High Court. This Court granted leave

to appeal on the question whether the High Court and the District Court

erred in law in applying the doctrine of stare decisis to this case.

The doctrine of state decisis was considered in the Full Bench decision of

this Court in the case of Mallika v. Siriwardena and Others

(SC/APPEAL/160/2016, SC Minutes of 02.12.2022). Stare decisis is an

abbreviation of the Latin phrase stare decisis et non quieta movere (to

stand by precedent and not to disturb settled points).

Regarding deed No. 1451, the Court of Appeal found it to be a nullity

because the notarial license of T.M.A. Sally who executed the deed No.

1451 of 11.04.1978 had not been extended beyond 22.02.1978.

Assuming this is true, this does not make the deed a nullity.

According to section 2 of the Notaries Ordinance No. 1 of 1907 as

amended every appointment to the office of notary shall be by warrant

granted by the Minister in charge of the subject. According to section 13,

it is a punishable offence for a person to practice as a notary without

such warrant. Once enrolled as a notary, he shall renew his certificate on

a yearly basis. Section 27 sets down the procedure to be followed in

granting certificates to practice as a notary on a yearly basis by every

Registrar of the High Court holden in every judicial zone. Section 29

provides for appeals for an aggrieved notary whose application for

certificate has been refused. What happens if such notary practices as a

notary without renewal of the certificate? Section 30 provides the answer:

If any person shall act as a notary without having obtained such

8

SC/APPEAL/58/2018

certificate as aforesaid, he shall for or in respect of every deed executed or

acknowledged before him as such notary, whilst he shall have been

without such certificate, be guilty of an offence and be liable to a fine not

less than five thousand rupees and not exceeding twenty five thousand

rupees. He will have to pay a fine in a sum not less than five thousand

rupees and not exceeding twenty five thousand rupees for every deed

executed. Until the Increase of Fines Act No. 12 of 2005 was enacted, the

fine was a sum not exceeding fifty rupees for every such deed. In terms

of section 35, such offence is even compoundable by the Registrar-

General. There is no provision in the Notaries Ordinance which makes

those deeds invalid.

I must emphasise that the instant appeal is not against the judgment of

the Court of Appeal. But consideration of the said Court of Appeal

judgment is intensely relevant to decide this appeal. Insofar as the

instant appeal is concerned, I hold that the said judgment of the Court

of Appeal does not represent the correct position of the law.

The High Court in its judgment cites Wickramanayake v. Perera (1932)

34 NLR 168 and states that in that case the issue of failure to renew

notarial license was discussed and it was held that if a notary had acted

as a notary before renewal of his certificate and obtained it later it has no

retrospective effect. I am in agreement with this statement of law.

However, in that case the question was not whether the deeds the notary

executed during that period were valid or invalid but whether the

conviction of the notary for failure to renew the certificate at the correct

time was right or wrong. That case is of no assistance to resolve the

instant issue.

The District Court in my view should not have allowed the defendant to

present a different case after the plaintiff closed his case by raising

additional issues on a judgment of a different case to which the plaintiff

9

SC/APPEAL/58/2018

was not a party. The District Court whilst answering issue Nos. 31 and

32 admits that the defendant was not a party to that case and therefore

the defendant is not bound by the judgment of the Court of Appeal.

Thereafter the learned District Judge fell into error by concluding that

the District Court is bound by that judgment on the doctrine of stare

decisis.

(stare decisis) . . 3412 1152

The District Court held that the plaintiff did not prove deed No. 1451 by

calling witnesses. At page 19 of the judgment, the District Court held that

in terms of section 31 of the Evidence Ordinance, admissions recorded at

the trial are not conclusive. This interpretation is erroneous. There was

no necessity to prove deed No. 1451 because it was recorded as a formal

admission at the commencement of the trial. Section 31 of the Evidence

Ordinance reads as follows: Admissions are not conclusive proof of the

matters admitted, but they may operate as estoppels under the provisions

hereinafter contained. Section 31 relates to informal admissions. It is

section 58 which is applicable to formal admissions in Court. Section 58

reads as follows: No fact need be proved in any proceeding which the

parties thereto or their agents agree to admit at the hearing, or which,

before the hearing, they agree to admit by any writing under their hands,

or which by any rule of pleading in force at the time they are deemed to

have admitted by their pleadings: Provided that the court may, in its

discretion, require the facts admitted to be proved otherwise than by such

admissions.

10

SC/APPEAL/58/2018

I answer the question of law on which leave was granted in the affirmative

and set aside the judgments of the High Court and the District Court and

allow the appeal. In view of the judgment of this Court there is no purpose

in directing the High Court to rehear the appeal. As I stated previously,

voluminous evidence has been led before the District Court on several

issues raised before that Court although the District Court ultimately

disregarded the entirety of the evidence on the erroneous basis that the

Court of Appeal judgment is binding on it. I direct the incumbent District

Judge of Matale to pronounce the judgment afresh on the evidence led

and to answer all the issues raised at the trial. Counsel for both parties

shall be given an opportunity to file comprehensive written submissions

before the matter is fixed for judgment. The plaintiff is entitled to costs in

all three Courts.
