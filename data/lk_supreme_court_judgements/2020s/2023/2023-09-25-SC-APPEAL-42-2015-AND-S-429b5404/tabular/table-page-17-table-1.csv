"them in respect of a defined legal relationship whether contractual or not.”"

"A careful consideration of the said section shows that unlike civil actions filed in the District Court,"
"the Arbitration Act provides a simple and flexible procedure to resolve disputes between the parties"
"that are subject to the said Act. It is pertinent to note that the phrase “all or certain disputes which"
"have arisen or which may arise between them” allows the parties to refer all or some of the disputes"
"between them to arbitration. Further, the phrase “which have arisen or which may arise between"
"them” allows the parties to refer disputes when and where they arise."
"Thus, the appellant-company was entitled in law to refer the disputes arising from or concerning"
"the  arbitration  Clause  in  the  said  Master  Lease  Financing  Agreement  jointly  or  separately  to"
"arbitration to resolve the disputes between the parties. In view of the above, I am of the view that"
"the  learned  High  Court  Judge  erred  in  law  by  holding  that  it  is  not  possible  to  have  multiple"
"arbitrations based on one arbitration agreement."
