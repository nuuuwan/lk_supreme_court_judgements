"made immediately, but only after the lapse of the period of one year and fourteen"
"days allowed for an application for enforcement. By that time, the learned Judge"
"had consolidated the proceedings: hence he could not have ignored the certified"
"copies  filed  in  the  STC’s  application,  which  admittedly,  were  identical  in  all"
"material respects to the copies tendered with the claimant’s application. He had"
"also  to  consider  (even  if  he  was  not  bound  by  it)  the  admission  in  the  STC’s"
"statement of objections that those copies were “duly certified”, as well as the fact"
"that, by them, the claimant had also tendered copies certified in terms of clause (i)."
"it was on all that material that the learned Judge had to decide whether the copies"
"had been certified to his satisfaction. In deciding that issue, he was perfectly correct"
"in  noting  that  the  Court  had  to  ensure  that  it  ‘gave  judgment  according  to  the"
"award” (cf section 31 (6)) : the object of section 31 (2) was to ensure that the High"
"Court did have true copies of the award. It was not reasonable, on the facts of this"
"case, to conclude that the copies initially filed were anything but true copies of the"
"originals. There was not even the faintest suspicion or suggestion that they were"
"inaccurate.”"
