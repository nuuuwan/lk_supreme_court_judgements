"It is pertinent to note that, there can be circumstances where it is not possible to file the original"
"arbitration  agreement  in  court,  including  instances  where  there  are  multiple  applications  for"
"enforcement of arbitral  awards. Thus, the Arbitration Act  has made provisions to  cater to  such"
"instances by including a provision to file ‘a duly certified copy’ of the arbitration agreement with"
"applications for the enforcement of arbitral awards. The phrase ‘a duly certified copy’ requires the"
"court to satisfy itself that a copy of the original arbitration agreement has been filed in court. In"
"the case of Kristley (Pvt) Limited v The State Timber Corporation [2002] 1 SLR 228 the copies"
"of the awards tendered with the claimant’s application certified by an Attorney-at-Law were held"
"as  “duly  certified  copies  within  the  meaning  of  section  31(2)(ii)  of  the  Arbitration  Act.  It  was"
"further held that even in a case where the copy of the award filed with the application is not a duly"
"certified copy, the application for enforcement may not be summarily rejected without giving an"
"opportunity  to  tender  duly  certified  copy  as  the  word  “accompany”  in  section  31(2)  has  been"
"included in the said section purposively and thus, it should be interpreted widely. In that judgment,"
