ARGUED ON : 13-09-2023

DECIDED ON : 20-09-2023

Order relating to preliminary objection

Both the Petitioner and the 6th Respondent had applied for the post of Principal (Sri Lanka

Education Administrative Service Grade I) responding to the notice produced marked F1 by

which the Secretary of the Ministry of Education had called for applications from suitable

candidates to fill thirty-one vacancies which existed at thirty-one National Schools in the year

2021. Subsequent to the selection process, the 6th Respondent has been appointed as principal

of Visaka Vidyalaya Colombo with effect from 24-01-2022. The Petitioner having failed to

secure that appointment from the said selection process, has challenged in this application

the appointment of the 6th Respondent to the post of Principal of Visaka Vidyalaya Colombo.

The Petitioner in her petition has prayed for four main reliefs:

1. A declaration that the marking scheme of Sri Lanka Education Administrative

Service class I officers to Grade I schools 2021 produced marked F3 has violated

the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution,

2. A declaration that the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1)

of the Constitution has been violated by the appointment of the 6th Respondent to

the post of Principal Visaka Vidyalaya with effect from 18-01-2022 and/or by not

awarding the Petitioner more marks than the 6th Respondent and/or by not

appointing the Petitioner to the said post,

3. A declaration that the appointment of the 6th Respondent to the post of Principal

Visaka Vidyalaya is null and void in law and to make an order directing the

Respondents to appoint the Petitioner to the post of Principal Visaka Vidyalaya with

effect from 18-01-2022.

At the outset, both the learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the 6th Respondent and

the learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for all the other Respondents (other than

the 6th Respondent), raised a preliminary objection that the Petitioner has filed this Petition

after the 01-month period permitted by Article 126(2) of the Constitution and therefore the

6

application is out of time. The Court proceeded to hear the submissions of all parties and

reserved its order.

According to the Respondents, it is the marking scheme of Sri Lanka Education Administrative

Service class I officers to Grade I schools - 2021 produced marked F3 which the Petitioner

has complained as having violated her fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

The Petitioner herself has applied responding to the notice calling for application (F1). The

list of vacancies expected to be filled through this appointment process has been produced

marked F2. The marking scheme relied on to award marks to the candidates has also been

produced marked F3. Admittedly, the marking sheet F3 has been published right from the

beginning in the website. The closing date for the submission of the application was 12-10-

2021. Petitioner has filed this application on 05-04-2022. There is no dispute that the

Petitioner was aware of the said published marking scheme (F3) at the time she had

forwarded her application for this post. Thus, the Petitioner has filed the instant application

more than six months after the aforesaid alleged act of infringement.

The Petitioner has stated that she had made a complaint to the Human Rights Commission

and therefore her application cannot be out of time as per Section 13 (1) of the Human Rights

Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 which reads as follows:

Where a complaint is made by an aggrieved party in terms of section 14, to the

Commission, within one month of the alleged infringement or imminent infringement

of a fundamental right by executive or administrative action, the period within which

the inquiry into such complaint is pending before the Commission, shall not be taken

into account in computing the period of one month within which an application may

be made to the Supreme Court by such person in terms of Article 126 (2) of the

Constitution.

Mr. Sanjeewa Jayawardena PC who appeared for the 6th Respondent argued that the Petitioner

has failed to prove that the inquiry into her complaint is pending before the Human Rights

Commission. However, we do not need to go that far because Section 13 (1) of the Human

Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act requires the Petitioner to pass a more preliminary

threshold. That is the requirement for the Petitioner to have made her complaint to the Human

Rights Commission within one month of the alleged infringement. According to the receipt

issued by the Human Rights Commission produced by the Petitioner marked O-1, the

Petitioner had made the complaint to the Human Rights Commission on 15-02-2022.

Therefore, it is clear that the Petitioner had made her complaint to the Human Rights

Commission very much after the one-month time allowed by Section 13 (1) of the Human

7

Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996. Therefore, irrespective of the fact that

the inquiry into the Petitioners complaint is pending before the Human Rights Commission or

not, the Petitioner's case cannot come under Section 13 (1) of the Human Rights Commission

of Sri Lanka Act for the purpose of computing the period of one month referred to in Article

126 (2) of the Constitution.

Therefore, we hold that the Petitioners application in so far as the challenge made to the

marking scheme F3 is out of time.

However, Mr. Ikram Mohommed PC submitted before us that he has sought other relief which

are not out of time as per Article 126(2) of the Constitution. He complained that , in certain

instances the Petitioner has been deprived of the marks which are legally due to her. Let us

proceed to consider that aspect of the case.

According to the marking scheme F3, marks to the candidates have been awarded under nine

categories. They are as follows:

1. Service experience

2. Educational qualifications

3. English language proficiency

4. Computer literacy

5. Service evaluation

6. Research and publication relevant to education

7. Presentation

8. Case study

9. Overall skills and personality at interview

Mr. Ikram Mohommed PC, contended that the Petitioners complaint is that she has not been

awarded marks to the qualifications and experience she had possessed in respect of the first

four categories (i.e., Service experience; Educational qualifications; English language

proficiency; Computer literacy) because the Marking Scheme has no such provision to

entertain and award marks to those qualifications. In particular, the Petitioner complains that

unlike the 2015 marking scheme, the marking scheme F3, used in this instance does not

permit award of marks to the qualifications and experience she had possessed in respect of

the third and fourth categories (i.e., English language proficiency; Computer literacy) because

the present Marking Scheme has no such provision to entertain and award such marks to

those qualifications. Thus, in effect, it is clear that the Petitioner is challenging the Marking

Scheme (F3) in respect of the award of marks under those four categories. Therefore, the

Petitioners complaint in respect of the first four categories (i.e., Service experience;

Educational qualifications; English language proficiency; Computer literacy) is also out of time.

8

In respect of the marks awarded under the 7th, 8th and 9th categories, (i.e., presentation, case

study and overall skills and personality at the interview), it is the complaint of the Petitioner

that she had performed better than the 6th Respondent in relation to the performance under

those three categories and therefore she should have been awarded more marks than she

has been awarded. We are of the view that we cannot get into the shoes of the panelists who

evaluated the applicants and proceed to consider and evaluate afresh, the performance of the

candidates by us. Therefore, we are unable to entertain the said complaint made in relation

to 7th, 8th and 9th categories.

What remains to be considered are the complaints made by the Petitioner in relation to the

5th category service evaluation, and the 6th category research and publication relevant to

education.

The complaint of the Petitioner with regard to service evaluation is that the Respondents

could not, in any event, have appointed the 6th Respondent according to the eligibility criteria

referred to in the Service Minute (produced marked Q) with the counter affidavit of the

Petitioner dated 28-11-2022. According to the table at page 13A of the Gazette No. 1928/28

dated 21st August 2015, for any applicant to be eligible to be appointed for the post of

Principal, he/she should be an officer in Grade I/II/III of the S.L.E.A.S. (General Cadre). While

the Petitioner claims that she is an officer in General Cadre, she asserts that the 6th

Respondent was not in General Cadre but in Special Cadre. However, as pointed out by both

Mr. Sanjeewa Jayawardena, PC and Mrs. Kanishka Balapatabendi DSG, at page 2A of the same

Gazette in clause 6.1 all Grade I officers must necessarily be in General Cadre. This is because

all officers in Grade I are classified under General cadre and there is no Special Cadre in

Grade 1. Therefore, the 6th Respondent who is a Grade I officer must necessarily belong to

the General Cadre. Thus, we see no merit in this argument either.

With regard to the 6th category i.e., research and publication relevant to education, it is the

position of the Petitioner that the Respondents had arbitrarily deprived her of due marks while

arbitrarily awarding undue marks to the 6th Respondent. In this regard we observe that both

the Petitioner and the 6th Respondent had been awarded three marks each (identical marks)

under this category. The total marks obtained by the Petitioner is 60 marks; the total marks

obtained by the 6th Respondent is 67 marks. Thus, the difference in total marks obtained by

the Petitioner and the 6th Respondent is seven marks;. The maximum mark any applicant

could obtain under this category (Research and publication relevant to education) is 05 marks.

Therefore, even if the Petitioners argument that the Respondents had arbitrarily deprived her

9

of due marks is accepted, the Petitioner can only score 02 more marks which will make her

total only 62 marks. Similarly, even if the argument of the Petitioner that the Respondents

had arbitrarily awarded undue marks to the 6th Respondent is accepted, the 6th Respondents

marks can be reduced only by 03 marks making the 6th Respondents total marks 64. Thus,

we observe that the Petitioner cannot succeed on this ground as well because the 6th

Respondent is still ahead of the Petitioner.

For the foregoing reasons Leave to Proceed is refused and the Petition is dismissed without

costs.
