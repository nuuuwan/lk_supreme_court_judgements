"I
n respect of the marks awarded under the 7th, 8th and 9th categories, (i.e., presentation, case"
"study and overall skills and personality at the interview), it is the complaint of the Petitioner"
"that she had performed better than the 6th Respondent in relation to the performance under"
"those three categories and therefore she should have been awarded more marks than she"
"has been awarded. We are of the view that we cannot get into the shoes of the panelists who"
"evaluated the applicants and proceed to consider and evaluate afresh, the performance of the"
"candidates by us. Therefore, we are unable to entertain the said complaint made in relation"
"to 7th, 8th and 9th categories."
"What remains to be considered are the complaints made by the Petitioner in relation to the"
"5th  category  service  evaluation,  and  the  6th  category  research  and  publication  relevant  to"
"education."
"The complaint  of  the Petitioner with regard to service evaluation is that the Respondents"
"could not, in any event,  have appointed the 6th Respondent according to the eligibility criteria"
"referred  to    in  the  Service  Minute  (produced  marked  Q)  with  the  counter  affidavit  of  the"
"Petitioner dated 28-11-2022. According to the table at page 13A of the Gazette No. 1928/28"
"dated  21st  August  2015,  for  any  applicant  to  be  eligible  to  be  appointed  for  the  post  of"
"Principal, he/she should be an officer in Grade I/II/III of the S.L.E.A.S. (General Cadre). While"
"the  Petitioner  claims  that  she  is  an  officer  in  General  Cadre,  she  asserts    that  the  6th"
"Respondent was not in General Cadre but in Special Cadre. However, as pointed out by both"
"Mr. Sanjeewa Jayawardena, PC and Mrs. Kanishka Balapatabendi DSG, at page 2A of the same"
"Gazette in clause 6.1 all Grade I officers must necessarily be in General Cadre. This is because"
"all officers in  Grade I are classified under ‘General cadre’ and there is no  ‘Special Cadre’ in"
"Grade 1. Therefore, the 6th Respondent who is a Grade I officer must necessarily belong to"
"the  General Cadre. Thus, we see no merit in this argument either."
