"of due marks is accepted, the Petitioner can only score 02 more marks which will make her"
"total only 62 marks. Similarly, even if the argument of the Petitioner that the Respondents"
"had arbitrarily awarded undue marks to the 6th Respondent is accepted, the 6th Respondent’s"
"marks can be reduced only by 03 marks making the 6th Respondent’s total marks 64. Thus,"
"we  observe  that  the  Petitioner  cannot  succeed  on  this  ground  as  well  because  the  6th"
"Respondent is still ahead of the Petitioner."
"For the foregoing reasons Leave to Proceed is refused and the Petition is dismissed without"
"costs."
