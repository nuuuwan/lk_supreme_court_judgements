While the petitioner was searching for the contact number, he has felt that the vehicle was moving slightly off its course. Within seconds of him instinctively raising his head, the Army Jeep has collided with the said three-wheeler causing the three-wheeler to be thrown off the road and over the culvert. As a result of the collision, the Army Jeep has also hit the culvert and come to a halt. Thereafter, the petitioner has got off the Army Jeep and rushed to the assistance of the injured persons, who were the passengers and the driver of the three-wheeler. The petitioner along with the assistance of the villagers that gathered around the scene of the accident, has rushed the injured persons to the Balangoda hospital in a Lorry. The driver of the Army Jeep was also taken to the hospital along with the escort Private in a separate vehicle. Thereafter, the petitioner has also got himself admitted in the hospital as he was suffering from a chest pain after being knocked against the dashboard. 5.
