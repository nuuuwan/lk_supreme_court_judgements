The Petitioner-Petitioner-Appellant-Appellant (Hatton National Bank Limited),

(hereinafter referred to as HNB), filed petition (case No. 17/99 CO) in the District Court

of Colombo praying for the winding up by Court, the company by the name of Lanka

Tractors Limited which stands in the caption of this judgment as the Respondent-

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 5 of 25

Respondent- Respondent. The said winding up application was filed in the District

Court on 02nd June 1999.

The learned District Judge, by order dated 14th March 2000, had dismissed the said

petition (filed by HNB which prayed for the winding up of Lanka Tractors Limited).

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned District Judge (order dated 14th March

2000), HNB filed the application bearing No. CA LA 83/2000 in the Court of Appeal

seeking Leave to Appeal against the said order of the learned District Judge. The Court

of Appeal on 02nd November 2000, granted Leave to Appeal as prayed for, in that

application.

Thereafter, the Court of Appeal having concluded the arguments of that case, by its

judgment dated 28th June 2001 -, set aside the order of the learned District Judge

dated 14th March 2000 and sent the case back to the District Court of Colombo to

consider and make an order relating to the preliminary issue of publication.

Thereafter, the learned District Judge by her order delivered on 13th June 2002-,

permitted the publication of the Petitioners claim in three newspapers. Pursuant to

the said order, a notice was published in the said papers after which creditors including

the Party Respondent - Respondent- Respondent, Seylan Bank PLC, (hereinafter

referred to as the Seylan Bank), filed their statements of claim. The claim put forward

by Seylan Bank as at 31st August 2002 was for Rs. 44,677,226/92.

In the meantime, during the period between the time of dismissal of the petition filed

by HNB praying for winding up Lanka Tractors Limited by the learned District Judge

on 14th March 2000, and the setting aside of the said order of dismissal by the Court

of Appeal on 28th June 2001, Lanka Tractors Limited, by way of Mortgage Bond No.

475 dated 12th May 2001 had mortgaged some of its properties and obtained credit

facilities from Seylan Bank.

As Lanka Tractors Limited had defaulted the re-payment of the aforesaid credit

facilities, Seylan Bank had taken steps to auction the property relevant to the said

Mortgage Bond by way of Parate Execution. When Seylan Bank published the

resolution of its board of directors which exercised its powers of Parate Execution in

the newspaper on 10th March 2006-, HNB had made the application dated 21st March

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 6 of 25

2006 to the District Court of Colombo in terms of Sections 260, 261, 348, 359 and

352 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 (hereinafter sometimes also referred to as

the Companies Act), seeking an order to stay the said execution on the basis that the

said execution proceedings had commenced after the winding up of Lanka Tractors

Limited and hence would have the effect of nullifying the liquidation proceedings. This

was on the basis that the said auction, if held, and the properties thereby sold, would

cause an irreparable damage and irremediable loss to HNB and all other creditors

(other than Seylan Bank) in the liquidation proceedings resulting in nullifying the effect

of the liquidation proceedings. In the said application, HNB had also prayed that the

Mortgage Bond relevant to the pending execution be set aside on the basis that it is

a fraudulent preference under Section 348 of the Companies Act and/or in terms of

Section 350 of the Companies Act. This application by HNB was on the basis that in

terms of Section 352 of the Companies Act, Seylan Bank had no right to proceed with

such execution of the property of Lanka Tractors Limited after the commencement of

its winding up proceedings.

Having considered the submissions of the parties, the learned District Judge by his

order dated 05th March 2007, restrained Seylan Bank from continuing with the Parate

Execution of the relevant property. The learned District Judge in the same order had

further held that the Mortgage Bond in question could not be declared null and void

as there was insufficient material in that regard. In other words, the learned District

Judge by its order dated 05th March 2007, though restrained Seylan Bank from

carrying out the said Parate Execution, refused to declare that the relevant Mortgage

was void.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned District Judge (dated 05th March

2007), HNB sought leave to appeal from the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal of

the Western Province in order to have the said order set aside and obtain a declaration

that the relevant Parate Execution proceeding is null void.

HNB in its petition before this Court states that: the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal of the Western Province on 30th July 2007 granted Leave to Appeal against the

learned District Judges order dated 05th March 2007and the matter was fixed for

argument; when the case was taken up for argument on 15th November 2007 Counsel

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 7 of 25

for Lanka Tractors Limited took up a series of preliminary objections; arguments

relating to the preliminary objections were concluded on the 3rd and 21st February

2008; High Court reserved its order on the preliminary objections for the 10th March

2008; thereafter the order had to be put off for number of dates as one of the Judges

of the bench was elevated to the Court of Appeal; subsequently on 3rd February 2009,

the judgement was delivered on the whole case despite the fact that the High Court

had reserved its order only on the preliminary objections raised by Lanka Tractors

Limited.

HNB complains before this Court that the learned Judges of the Provincial High Court

of the Civil Appeal by their Judgment dated 3rd February 2009, wrongly dismissed the

whole appeal.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal, HNB

sought Leave to Appeal from this Court and accordingly, on 30th June 2009, this Court

granted Leave to Appeal on the questions of law set out in paragraphs 28 (1), 28 (2),

28 (4) and 28 (5), of the petition dated 16th March 2009. At the time the Court decided

to grant Leave to Appeal to the afore-stated four questions of law, at the instance of

Seylan Bank, two more questions of law (No. 5 and 6 below) were also framed. It was

thereafter that HNB framed another question of law (No. 7 below) as a consequential

question of law. The said questions of law being renumbered by me as 1-7

respectively, are to the following effect.

1) In the light of the conclusion that the disposition of property after a winding up

application has been led, is void and such disposition includes a mortgage as

well, whether the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal has erred in law when it

held that the mortgage was in order as it was executed after the original

petition was dismissed and prior to its restoration by the Court of Appeal, when

in fact all claims against Lanka Tractors Limited are xed as at the

commencement of the winding up;

2) Whether the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal has erred in law when they

failed to take into account the fact that the Court of Appeal by its order dated

28-06-2001 had restored the HNBs application for winding up of Lanka Tractors

Limited which resulted in the winding up of Lanka Tractors Limited deeming to

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 8 of 25

have commenced at the time of the filing of the application for winding up

which was 02-06-1999 which was prior to the mortgage in question;

3) Whether the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal has erred in law when they

had failed to take into account the fact that the said disposition of the property

by Lanka Tractors Limited was done with the sole object of defrauding the

creditors of Lanka Tractors Limited thereby creating a diminution of the assets

of Lanka Tractors Limited which was not an act done honestly and in the

ordinary course of business.

4) Whether the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal has failed to consider the fact

that Lanka Tractors Limited had knowledge that Leave to Appeal was granted

in the aforesaid application No. CA / LA 83 / 2000 when Lanka Tractors Limited

executed the Mortgage Bond in favour of Seylan Bank after the order of

dismissal of the application for winding up by the HNB on 14-03-2000;

5) Whether a Mortgage Bond is a disposition within the meaning of Section 260

of the Companies Act;

6) Whether the HNBs application to the High Court of the Western Province was

correct; in that it was a Leave to Appeal application whereas in fact it should

have been a nal appeal.

7) Is the Seylan Bank entitled in law to raise the question of law No. (6) at this

stage?

It would be appropriate to deal with the question of law No. (6) and (7) at the

beginning itself. The question of law No. (6) has been formulated by Seylan Bank on

the premise that HNBs petition to the High Court of Western Province should have

been a petition of a nal appeal. While this can be gathered from the wordings of the

question of law No. (6) itself, Seylan Bank in its written submissions1 also has

confirmed its position by stating therein that the correct application if at all is for

revision and in any event, it is a final appeal. However, what Seylan Bank had sought

to advance in the same written submission is the argument that an appeal is only

1 Written submissions Dated 17-09-2009 filed before this Court by Seylan Bank.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 9 of 25

possible when an act specifically gives permission to appeal. It is Seylan Banks

argument that there is no provision in law to permit an appeal against an order made

in terms of sections 260 and 261 of the Companies Act. In support of the above

position Seylan Bank has relied on authorities: Gunaratne vs. Thambinayagam and

others,2 Bakmeewewa vs. Raja,3 Martin vs. Wijewardane,4 Peoples Bank vs. Perera,5

Dassenayake vs. Sampath Bank.6

In my view, the question whether a party has a right of appeal is different to the

question whether an aggrieved party should file an appeal or a leave to appeal

application against an order with which such party is dissatisfied with. In these

circumstances, I find that Seylan Bank has made no submission regarding the question

of law No. (6) in respect of which this Court has granted leave to appeal. This leads

me to form the view that Seylan Bank has abandoned pursuing the question of law

No. (6). In view of such abandonment of the question of law No. (6), the consequential

question of law (question of law No. (7)) raised by HNB does not arise. Hence, I would

not proceed any further to deal with both the questions of law No. (6) and (7).

The question of law No. (4) raises the issue whether Lanka Tractors Limited had

knowledge of leave to appeal being granted to HNBs application No. CA / LA 83 /

2000 when it executed the relevant Mortgage Bond in favour of the Seylan Bank. Let

me next consider this question.

HNB filed the winding up application9 in the District Court on 02nd June 1999. The

learned District Judge dismissed the petition on 14th March 2000. HNB filed the

application No. CA LA 83/2000 in the Court of Appeal seeking Leave to Appeal against

the said order of the learned District Judge dated 14th March 2000. The Court of

Appeal granted leave to appeal on 02nd November 2000.-. It was on 12th May 2001

that Lanka Tractors Limited, by way of Mortgage Bond No. 475 had mortgaged the

relevant properties to obtain credit facilities from Seylan Bank. Thus, it is clear that

Lanka Tractors Limited, had executed the Mortgage Bond No. 475 to mortgage the

3 (1989) 1 SLR 231.

4 (1989) 2 SLR 250.

5 (2003) 2 SLR 358.

6 (2002) 3 SLR 268.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 10 of 25

relevant properties to Seylan Bank, more than 06 months after the Court of Appeal

had granted Leave to Appeal against the order of the learned District Judge dismissing

the petition for winding up.

Seylan Bank, neither in the statement of objections dated 27th June 2006 nor in the

affidavit dated 22nd June 2006 filed by the Chief Manager, Foreign Currency Banking

Unit of Seylan Bank T Jegatheeswaran has taken up any position that it was not aware

of the fact that the Court of Appeal, on 02nd November 2000, had granted Leave to

Appeal against the order of the learned District Judge dismissing the petition for

winding up.

Moreover, the fact whether Lanka Tractors Limited was or was not aware that the

Court of Appeal, on 02nd November 2000, had granted leave to appeal against the

order of the learned District Judge is a matter exclusively within the knowledge of

Lanka Tractors Limited. While no party has addressed this issue, I have to proceed on

the basis that the said fact was well within the knowledge of Lanka Tractors Limited

which was a party to the said proceedings in the Court of Appeal. I have no basis to

hold the contrary. Section 106 of the Evidence Ordinance reads thus: When any fact

is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is

upon him. Lanka Tractors Limited, has not taken up the position that it was not aware

of such fact. Thus, I hold that Lanka Tractors Limited has failed to discharge its burden

that it did not have any knowledge of Court of Appeal, granting leave to appeal against

the order of the learned District Judge on 02nd November 2000 dismissing the petition

for winding up. In those circumstances, I hold that at the time Lanka Tractors Limited

executed the Mortgage Bond No. 475, it did so with full knowledge that the winding

up process was still alive as the Court of Appeal by that time had granted Leave to

Appeal against the order of the learned District Judge dismissing the petition for

winding up. Perusal of the judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal shows

clearly that it had not at all considered this aspect of the case.

Let me now proceed to consider the question of law No. 02. That revolves around the

question whether the winding up of Lanka Tractors Limited should be deemed to have

commenced at the time of filing of the application for winding up which was 02nd June

1999.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 11 of 25

Section 262 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 is relevant in this regard and is as

follows:

(1) Where, before the presentation of a petition for the winding up of a

company by the court, a resolution has been passed by the company for

voluntary winding up, the winding up of the company shall be deemed to

have commenced at the time of the passing of the resolution, and unless

the court, on proof of fraud or mistake, thinks fit otherwise to direct, all

proceedings taken in the voluntary winding up shall be deemed to have

been validly taken.

(2) In any other case, the winding up of a company by the court shall be

deemed to commence at the time of the presentation of the petition for the

winding up.

Thus, the plain reading of the above section clearly shows that the date of

commencement of the winding up of a company by Court must be taken as the date

of filing of the application for winding up. Legislature in its wisdom has mentioned it

as a deeming provision for good reasons. It is because the actual winding up order is

made after the petition praying for winding up is filed. What happens if the date of

commencement of the winding up of a company is taken as the date of the actual

order of Court that the company be wound up? In such event, the company under

winding up is able to alienate its property leaving nothing for its creditors. If that be

the case, any application for winding up would not achieve any practical result. Thus,

it is clear that the legislature has intended to restrain (indirectly) the company under

winding up from making any disposition after any petition for winding up of that

company has been filed. This is the mischief the legislature has intended to suppress.

This view is further supported by section 261 which states thus: Where any Company

is being wound up by court, any attachment, sequestration, distress, or execution put

in force against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the

winding up shall be void to all intents. This means that the company under winding

up has an obligation to stop such dispositions of its property after any petition for

winding up of that company has been filed.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 12 of 25

Following quotations would show that the above position is consonant with English

law principles set out in various legal literature.

Sarah Worthington in Sealy & Worthingtons Text, Cases & Materials in Company

Law,10 states the following.

For many statutory purposes, a winding up takes effect from its

'commencement', which may involve some backdating. IA 1986 s 8611

provides that a voluntary winding up is deemed to commence at the time

of the passing of the resolution for winding up. In the case of a compulsory

winding up, the liquidation is deemed to commence at the time of the

presentation of the petition (and not the making of the order itself), but if

the company is already in voluntary liquidation when the petition is

presented, the relevant time is when the winding-up resolution was passed

(s 129).

Gower Principles of Modern Company Law12 comments on the above as follows.

On the making of a winding up order the winding up is deemed to have

commenced as from the date of the presentation of the petition (or, indeed,

if the order is made in respect of a company already in voluntary winding

up, as from the date of the resolution to wind up voluntarily). This dating

back is important since it can have the effect of invalidating property

dispositions and executions of judgments lawfully undertaken during the

period between the presentation of the petition and the order, and of

affecting the duration of the periods prior to "the onset of insolvency" in

which, if certain transactions are undertaken, they are liable to adjustment

or avoidance in the event of winding up or administration.

10 Sarah Worthington in Sealy & Worthingtons Text, Cases & Materials in Company Law 11th Edition p. 851-852.

11 Section 86 of the United Kingdoms Insolvency Act 1986 states that A voluntary winding up is deemed to commence at the time of the passing of the resolution for voluntary winding up.

12 Paul L. Davies and Sarah Worthington in Gower principles of modern company law 10th edition p. 1157.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 13 of 25

Thus, as the winding up application by the petitioner was presented to the District

Court on 3rd June 1999, in terms of section 262 of the Companies Act, if an order to

wind up has been made, the winding up must stand as having commenced from the

date of presentation of the petition to Court.

The Court of Appeal by its order dated 28th June 2001restored HNBs application for

winding up of Lanka Tractors Limited. After its restoration, there is winding up

proceedings before Court to which section 262 of the Companies Act must apply. Thus,

the effect of the restoration of HNBs application for winding up of Lanka Tractors

Limited is that Lanka Tractors Limited must stand as having commenced its winding

up proceedings from 02nd June 1999-i.e., the date of presentation of the petition to

Court. Therefore, winding up of Lanka Tractors Limited is deemed to have commenced

on 02nd June 1999 (at the time of filing of the application in Court for winding up).

The Provincial High Court has failed to appreciate that aspect of the case.

It is now time to turn to the question of law No. 05. That is the question whether the

Mortgage Bond executed by Lanka Tractors Limited is a disposition within the meaning

of section 260 of the Companies Act. At the outset, it has to be noted that the original

application dated 21st March 2006 relevant to this proceeding made in the District

Court by HNB had been filed in terms of sections 260, 261, 348, 350 and 352 of the

Companies Act No. 17 of 1982.

HNB argues that the Mortgage Bond No. 475 dated 12th May 2001 executed by Lanka

Tractors Limited to obtain credit facilities from Seylan Bank is a disposition of the

property of the company, made after the commencement of the winding up, and

therefore falls within the meaning of section 260 of the Companies Act. HNB therefore

argues that the said Mortgage Bond shall be void as per the said section.

In contradiction to the above argument, Seylan Bank argues that the Mortgage Bond

No. 475 dated 12th May 2001 is not a disposition within the meaning of section 260 of

the Companies Act. It is the above issue that I have to decide in the question of law

No. (5) which I would now proceed to consider.

Section 260 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 is as follows:

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 14 of 25

In a winding up by the court, any disposition of the property of the

company, including things in action, and any transfer of shares, or alteration

in the status of the members of the company, made after the

commencement of the winding up, shall, unless the court otherwise orders,

be void.

Section 260 unambiguously states that any disposition of the property of the company

made after the commencement of the winding up, shall, unless the court otherwise

orders, be void. The several items specified in that section i.e., any transfer of shares,

or alteration in the status of the members of the company are merely some of such

dispositions and hence are not exhaustive. Therefore, what has been declared void by

that section is any disposition. Thus, I need to now examine the meaning of the term

disposition set out in section 260.

As per Blacks Law Dictionary,13 the term disposition is defined as follows:

The act of transferring something to another's care or possession, esp. by

deed or will; the relinquishing of property <a testamentary disposition of all

the assets>.

The District Judge in his order has held that the execution of Mortgage Bond No. 475

dated 12th May 2001 by Lanka Tractors Limited, to mortgage some of its properties to

obtain credit facilities from Seylan Bank cannot be considered a disposition within the

meaning of section 260 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982. However, on appeal,

the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal had held that the said execution of Mortgage

Bond No. 475 dated 12th May 2001 is a disposition within the meaning of section 260

of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982. Neither Lanka Tractors Limited nor Seylan Bank

has canvassed the said conclusion by the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal.

However, in the instant appeal HNB had prayed inter alia in its Leave to Appeal

application the followings:

i. to set aside the order of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal of the

Western Province dated 3rd February 2009 and the order of the District

Court dated 5th March 2007;

13 11th Edition page 592.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 15 of 25

ii. to declare that the said Mortgage Bond No. 475 dated 12th May 2001

executed in favour of the Party Respondent (Seylan Bank) is null and void;

iii. to set aside and/ or rescind the said Mortgage Bond No 475 dated 12th May

2001 executed in favour of the Party Respondent (Seylan Bank).

It is the position of Seylan Bank that mortgages would not be considered as disposition

as ownership is retained in the Mortgagor in the case of a mortgage. To the contrary,

HNB argues that such mortgage is:

a) contrary to sections 260 and 261 of the Companies Act in light of the order

made by their Lordships in the Court of Appeal reviving this case;

b) an act done to defraud the creditors of the company in the liquidation

proceedings causing diminution of the Company assets; and

c) would render the liquidation proceedings a mere technicality and the entire

purpose of those proceedings made nugatory.

In considering the above arguments, it would be relevant to refer to the following

passage taken from Akers and others vs. Samba Financial Group14 where Lord Mance

observed the following regard to section 127 of the Insolvency Act 1986 of the United

Kingdom which is similar to aforementioned section 260 of the Companies Act.

However, it is fair to say that the word disposition is linguistically capable

of applying to a transaction which involves the destruction or termination of

an interest

And it is possible to claim support for such a view in relation to section 127

from respected authors. Thus, Professor Sir Roy Goode in Principles of

Corporate Insolvency Law, 4th ed (2011) at para 13-127 states that

[s]ection 127 bites on beneficial ownership, not necessarily on the legal

title. And at para 13-128, he says that [t]he word disposition ... must be

given a wide meaning if the purpose of the section is to be achieved,

particularly in view of the fact that there is no exception in favour of transfers

14 (2017) UKSC 6

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 16 of 25

for full value; particularly relevantly for present purposes, this passage

continues: [d]isposition should therefore be considered to include not only

any dealing in the companys ... assets by sale, exchange, lease, charge, gift

or loan but also ... any other act which in reducing or extinguishing the

companys rights in an asset, transfers value to another person. Sir Roy

then explains that on this basis disposition includes an agreement whereby

the company surrenders a lease or gives up contractual rights. And

McPhersons Law of Company Liquidation, 3rd ed (2013), para 7-015, states

that section 127 only [applies to] property which belongs in equity to the

company and is confined to the companys beneficial interest in property

Further in Re Leslie engineers Co. Ltd.15 Oliver J had observed that,

on the true construction of section 227 of the Act of 1948, the term

dispositions included dispositions of a companys property whether made

by the company or by a third party or whether made directly or indirectly;

Accordingly, it is apparent that in the context of winding up, the term disposition

covers a wide range of transactions which diminish the value of the companys assets

while transferring the same to another.

A mortgage bond in general is executed in such a way that it binds a property taken

as a security for the repayment of a debt. In the instant case, Lanka Tractors Limited

executed the Mortgage Bond No. 475 dated 12th May 2001 in regard to some of its

properties in return for credit facilities from the Seylan Bank. Accordingly, by

mortgaging the said properties to Seylan Bank, Lanka Tractors Limited has authorized

Seylan Bank to sell it by public auction and recover its dues in case of a failure to

settle credit facilities.

In the Australian case of Re Dittmer Gold Mines Ltd.16 the Supreme Court of Brisbane

reached the same conclusion holding that the memorandum of mortgage, although

executed after the order for winding-up, was nevertheless a disposition of the property

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 17 of 25

of The Companies Acts, 1931 1942, and was void unless the court otherwise

ordered.

It would be relevant to note that the above decision (Re Dittmer Gold Mines Ltd.) was

given in regard to section 178 of their Companies Acts, 1931 1942 which is in fact

identical to section 260 of our Companies Act where the provision reads,

In a winding-up by the court, any disposition of the property of the

company, including things in action, and any transfer of shares or alteration

in the status of the members of the company made after the commencement

of the winding-up shall, unless the court otherwise orders, be void.

Therefore, I find no reason to oppose the afore stated general consensus of courts

which have observed the wide interpretation of the term disposition. Moreover,

section 352 of the Companies Act would also confirm the position that the legislature

has placed expressed restriction on the rights of creditors as to execution attachment

in relation to properties of a company under winding up. The said section is

reproduced below for easy reference.

(1) Where a creditor has issued execution against the goods or lands of a

company or has attached any debt due to the company, and the company

is subsequently wound up, he shall not be entitled to retain the benefit of

the execution or attachment against the liquidator in the winding up of the

company unless he has completed the execution or attachment before the

date of commencement of the winding up.

Provided that

(a) where any creditor has had notice of a meeting having been called at

which a resolution for voluntary winding up is to be proposed, the

date on which the creditor so had notice shall for the purposes of the

preceding provisions be substituted for the date of commencement of

the winding up;

(b) a person who purchases in good faith under a sale by order of court

any goods of a company on which an execution has been levied shall

in all cases acquire a good title to them against the liquidator;

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 18 of 25

(c) the rights conferred by the provisions of this sub- section on the

liquidator may be set aside by the court in favour of the creditor to

such extent and subject to such terms as the court may think fit.

(2) For the purposes of this section, an execution against goods shall be taken

to be completed by seizure and sale, and an attachment of a debt shall be

deemed to be completed by receipt of the debt, and an execution against

land shall be deemed to be completed by seizure and, in the case of an

equitable interest, by the appointment of a receiver.

(3) In this section the expression " goods " includes all movable property.

Thus, in light of the wide interpretation given to the term disposition and the intention

of the legislature to restrict the rights of creditors as to the execution of attachments

in relation to properties of a company under winding up it can be stated that even the

question of ownership would not be of strict relevance in interpreting whether a

particular act could be regarded as a disposition. Therefore, the position taken up by

Seylan Bank that mortgages would not be considered as disposition as ownership is

still retained in the Mortgagor, cannot be accepted.

As has been clarified above, the term disposition should be given a wider meaning

than the transfer, which is used to interpret a change of title. This is why the

legislature in its wisdom has used the term disposition instead of the term transfer.

What has happened in this case is that Lanka Tractors Limited has mortgaged the

relevant properties to Seylan Bank just few months before the pronouncement of the

judgment in the Court of Appeal and defaulted the repayment. The resultant position

of this act is the commencement of Parate Execution proceedings by Seylan Bank to

auction the property and recover its dues. Therefore, there is no doubt that the

cumulative effect of the entire process of the execution of Mortgage Bond No. 475 by

Lanka Tractors Limited and the subsequent default of repayment thereof which led

Seylan Bank to commence Parate Execution of the property, has amounted to an act

of transferring the beneficial interest of the relevant property to Seylan bank to enable

it to become the owner through Parate Execution. That is the way Lanka Tractors

Limited had chosen to relinquish its beneficial interest in the relevant property.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 19 of 25

It would be only Lanka Tractors Limited which would know if it had any other

purpose/intention other than that mentioned above. But Lanka Tractors Limited had

not even attempted to explain why it decided to execute the Mortgage Bond No. 475.

In light of the above, it would be absurd to hold that the Mortgage Bond No. 475

executed by Lanka Tractors Limited in favour of Seylan Bank cannot be invalidated on

the mere fact that it is only a mortgage. The purpose of this section is clear and wide

enough to bring the Mortgage Bond No. 475 under section 260 despite the word

mortgage is not found in its list of items. In these circumstances, I have no hesitation

to hold that irrespective of the fact that the title does not pass in a mortgage, the

Mortgage Bond No. 475 is a disposition within the meaning of section 260 of the

Companies Act.

I would now deal with the question of law No. (3). The primary issue raised in question

of law No. (3) is whether the said disposition of the property by Lanka Tractors Limited

was done with the sole object of defrauding its creditors. Section 348 of the Companies

Act which describes about Fraudulent reference would be relevant in this regard. It is

as follows:

(1) Any conveyance, mortgage, delivery of goods, payment, execution, or

other act relating to property which would, if made or done by or against

an individual, be deemed in his insolvency a fraudulent preference, shall if

made or done by or against a company, be deemed, in the event of its

being wound up, a fraudulent preference of its creditors, and be invalid

accordingly.

(2) For the purposes of this section, the commencement of the winding up shall

be deemed to correspond with the act of insolvency in the case of an

individual.

(3) Any conveyance or assignment by a company of all its property to trustees

for the benefit of all its creditors shall be void to all intents.

Having considered the arguments in relation to the question of law No. (4), I have

already held that Lanka Tractors Limited had executed the Mortgage Bond No. 475

with full knowledge that the winding up process was still alive as the Court of Appeal

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 20 of 25

by that time had granted Leave to Appeal against the order of the learned District

Judge dismissing the petition for winding up.

There can be two inferences from the above conclusion. One is that the disposition of

the property relevant to the issue at hand by Lanka Tractors Limited was done with

the sole object of defrauding its creditors. The other is that the said disposition of the

property was done by Lanka Tractors Limited without any object of defrauding its

creditors. As to which object Lanka Tractors Limited had when it had executed the

Mortgage Bond No. 475 is only within the exclusive knowledge of Lanka Tractors

Limited itself.

I have already mentioned about the rule of evidence that would be applicable in

situations of this nature. The said rule is contained in section 106 of the Evidence

Ordinance which I have already reproduced before.

The first illustration mentioned under the section of the Evidence Ordinance states

thus:

When a person does an act with some intention other than that which the

character and circumstances of the act suggest, the burden of proving that

intention is upon him.

Thus, when taking into the character and the circumstances under which the Mortgage

Bond No. 475 has been executed coupled with the fact that it is Lanka Tractors Limited

which has the exclusive knowledge of the relevant facts, Lanka Tractors Limited has

a legal obligation to prove that it acted with some intention other than that which the

character and circumstances of the aforesaid execution suggests. Lanka Tractors

Limited, has not taken up any position in relation to the question whether the

disposition of the relevant property was done with or without the object of defrauding

its creditors. Thus, I hold that Lanka Tractors Limited has failed to discharge its burden

that it did not have the object of defrauding its creditors when it executed the

Mortgage Bond No. 475 with full knowledge that the winding up process was still alive

as the Court of Appeal by that time had granted leave to appeal against the order of

the learned District Judge dismissing the petition for winding up.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 21 of 25

Learned Counsel drew our attention to the views expressed by the Court of Appeal in

the unreported case of L. M. Apparels (Pvt) Ltd. vs. E. H. Cooray & others.17 In that

case, S. N. Silva J. (as he was then) stated as follows:

"Submissions of learned President's Counsel relate to the ambit and effect

of the provisions contained in section 260 of the Companies Act and the

procedure to be adopted in a matter where the provisions of the section

are sought to be applied.

The provision is identical with section 227 of the Companies Act of England.

The ambit of operation of this provision may be more readily

comprehended by reference to the commentary in Palmer's Company Law,

23rd ed. vol 1. page 1185. The commentary based on cases decided in

England is as follows:

A disposition of the property of the Company, including things in

action and a transfer of shares or alteration in the status of the

members of the company, made after the commencement of the

winding up, is void unless the Court otherwise orders (1948 Act. 'S

227): but the practice of the Court is to allow such payments or

dispositions, pending the petition, if made honestly and in the

ordinary course of business. The exercise of the discretion of the

Court under this section is controlled only by the general principles

of justice and fairness. Such an order may be made prior to the

hearing of the winding up order.

The foregoing commentary, made with reference to the practice of court,

reveals that the provision is not to be construed as it were a guillotine

which indiscriminately strikes down every disposition of property of the

company made after the commencement of its winding up, with a reserved

power vested in the Court to validate any such disposition. The words

unless the Court otherwise orders, be void should be understood as

subjecting every disposition of property of the company made after the

commencement of the winding up, to the scrutiny of Court with a

17 CA Application No. 584/93, decided on 25th March 1994.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 22 of 25

overriding discretion vested in the Court to permit such disposition to

stand.. 18

I have held that Lanka Tractors Limited has failed to discharge its burden that it did

not have the object of defrauding its creditors when it executed the Mortgage Bond

No. 475 when it had the full knowledge that the winding up process was still alive as

the Court of Appeal by that time had granted Leave to Appeal against the order of the

learned District Judge dismissing the petition for winding up. Although the above

conclusion is a sufficient answer to the question of law under consideration, in view

of the fact that the above case was cited before us, I would briefly mention about the

question whether it would be just and fair in the circumstances of this case for Court

to permit this disposition to stand.

Lanka Tractors Limited was fully aware at the time they mortgaged the property to

Seylan Bank Limited on or about 12th May 2001 the fact that HNB had sought Leave

to Appeal from the Court of Appeal against the dismissal of the winding up petition.

In fact, Leave to Appeal had already been granted on 2nd November 2000 by the time

the mortgage bond was executed on or about 12th May 2001. Thus, Lanka Tractors

Limited has not adduced any basis/material upon which I can hold that the said

disposition was made honestly in its ordinary course of business.

The attention of court was also drawn to the case of Express Electrical Ltd v Beavis

and Ors.19 The case concerned with a validation order in a situation where a person

had delivered goods to a company at the time when a winding up petition had been

filed. The object of a validation order in that a case was to validate the payment made

by the company for goods supplied. In that case Lord Justice Sales observed:

The true position is that, save in exceptional circumstances, a validation

order should only be made in relation to dispositions occurring after

presentation of winding up petition if there is some special circumstance

which shows that the disposition in question will be (in a prospective

application case) or has been (in a retrospective application case) for the

18 at page 8.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 23 of 25

benefit of the general body of unsecured creditors, such that it is

appropriate to disapply the usual pari passu principle.

I have already cited above, section 348 (1) of the Companies Act. That section

specifically encompasses mortgages. I have no difficulty in holding that the execution

of mortgage bond on 12th May 2001 i.e., the property relevant to the instant case if

executed by or against an individual, would, be deemed in his insolvency a fraudulent

preference. If that is so, then such mortgage if made or done by or against a company,

shall be deemed, in the event of its being wound up, a fraudulent preference of its

creditors, and be invalid accordingly. (The commencement of the winding up shall be

deemed to correspond with the act of insolvency in the case of an individual (section

348(2)).

Attention of the Court was also drawn in this regard to Re Kushler Ltd.20 In that case,

the appellant was the liquidator of the company and the respondents were the

companys bankers. The appellant sought a declaration of fraudulent preference in

respect of all payments made to the respondents between 23rd of February and 23rd

of May 1941 which was the date of the resolution for voluntary winding up. The

company had an overdraft at the bank which overdraft was guaranteed by a director

of the company and secured by the deposit of certain policies belonging to him.

Payments were made into the Bank as the result of which the overdraft was

extinguished. The liquidator claimed that the payments to the bank constituted a

fraudulent preference. In the above circumstances, it was held in that case, that the

proper inference to be drawn was that the payments to the bank after May 10th May

1941, were made with a view of giving the bank a preference over the other creditors

by so discharging the guarantee.

The sections 260, 261, 348, 350 and 352 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 which

HNB has referred to in the caption of its petition filed in the District Court are sections

found under the PART IX of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982. Section 348 thereof

covers a mortgage as well. Cumulative effect of those provisions is to prevent the

company under winding up, disposing its assets by some means in order to deprive

20 (1943) 2 All ER 22.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 24 of 25

its creditors, the value of those properties. In the instant case, Lanka Tractors Limited

was well aware that the winding up proceedings against it was in progress. In these

circumstances, there is a heavy burden on Lanka Tractors Limited to satisfy court that

it did not intend to defraud the creditors by executing the relevant mortgage.

However, as I have mentioned before, Lanka Tractors Limited has failed to place any

acceptable material to satisfy court that its action was one that was in the course of

the ordinary business.

In the above circumstances, I hold that Lanka Tractors Limited had executed the

Mortgage Bond No. 475 with the sole object of defrauding its creditors.

What is now left for me is only to consider the question of law No. (1).

I have held that at the time Lanka Tractors Limited executed the Mortgage Bond No.

475, it did so with full knowledge that the winding up process was still alive as the

Court of Appeal by that time had granted leave to appeal against the order of the

learned District Judge dismissing the petition for winding up. [vide discussion relating

to Question of law No. (4)]

I have also held that winding up of Lanka Tractors Limited is deemed to have

commenced on 02nd June 1999(at the time of the filing of application in Court for

winding up). [vide discussion relating to Question of law No. (2)]

I have further held that the Mortgage Bond No. 475 is a disposition within the meaning

of section 260 of the Companies Act. [vide discussion relating to Question of law No.

(5)]

I have also held that Lanka Tractors Limited executed the Mortgage Bond No. 475

with the sole object of defrauding its creditors. [vide discussion relating to Question

of law No. (3)]

In the light of the above conclusions, I hold that that the Provincial High Court of Civil

Appeal has erred in law when it held that the Mortgage Bond No. 475 was in order as

it was executed after the original Petition was dismissed and prior to its restoration by

the Court of Appeal, when in fact all claims against Lanka Tractors Limited are xed

as at the commencement of the winding up.

[SC Appeal No. 85A /2009] Page 25 of 25

Thus, I proceed to set aside the judgment of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal

of the Western Province dated 3rd February 2009 and the order of the District Court

dated 5th March 2007. I hold that the Mortgage Bond No 475 dated 12th May 2001

executed in favour of the Party Respondent (Seylan Bank) is null and void and has no

force or avail in law.

Hatton National Bank is entitled to the costs of litigation in both Courts.
