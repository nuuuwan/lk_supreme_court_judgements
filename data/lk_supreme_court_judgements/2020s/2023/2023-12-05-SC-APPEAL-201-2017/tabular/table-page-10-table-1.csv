…  In  cases  of  employment  which  demand  a  high  level  of  responsibility  and"
"autonomy,  a  lapse  in  integrity  is  the  precise  sort  of  moral  turpitude  that  can"
"result in a particularly devastating structural and managerial breakdown simply"
"because  of  the  reliance  and  expectation  placed  in  the  hands  of  such  positions,"
"and  as  such  is  the  sort  of  transgressive  behaviour  for  which  termination  of"
"services can be justified.” [emphasis added]"
