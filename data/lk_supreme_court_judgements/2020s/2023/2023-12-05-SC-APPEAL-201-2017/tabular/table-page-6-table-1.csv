"conducted  in  accordance  with  the  law.  The  Respondent  admitted  that  he  was"
"guilty  of  the  second  charge,  that  his  inability  to  assess  the  eligibility  of  loan"
"borrowers resulted in the funds being misappropriated by third parties, causing"
"the Appellant significant loss."
"T
he  Appellant  draws  the  court's  attention  to  the  evidence  of  the  Appellant's"
"witness,  who  clearly  stated  that  the  six  officers  who  placed  their  signatures  in"
"approving the loans are no longer in service. Therefore, it is the position of the"
"Appellant  that  the  High  Court  judge's  findings  that  one  person  who  placed  his"
"signature  in  approving  the  loans  still  being  in  service  while  the  Respondent's"
"services  were  terminated  had  proved  mala  fide  on  the  part  of  the  Appellant  is"
"unjust and unreasonable."
"M
oreover,  the  Respondent  has not presented any  evidence to show  that  he  has"
"been  victimised  in  any  way.  Thus,  the  High  Court's  finding  that  there  was  no"
"previous  charge  against  the  Respondent  is  also  incorrect,  as  the  Respondent"
"revealed  in  his  examination-in-chief  that  he  was  warned  for  improper  asset"
"assessment on one occasion and suspended for one month at half salary."
"I
n light of the above, the Appellant claims that the Learned High Court Judge's"
"determination 
that  what 
the  Respondent  has  done 
is 
just  authorising 
loans"
"without examining the borrowers' income is erroneous. The Appellant therefore"
"claims that the award of compensation granting back wages is erroneous."
"T
he Appellant also claims that the Respondent has failed to present any evidence"
"of actual financial loss incurred by him as a result of the Appellant's termination"
"of  his  services.  It 
is  well  established 
that 
the  employee  must  prove  actual"
"financial 
loss  he  suffered  as  a  result  of 
the  employer's 
termination  of  his"
"employment.  If  the  employee  fails  to  provide  proof  in  this  regard,  the  Labour"
"Tribunal cannot award compensation even if it is proven that the termination of"
"the employee's services was unjust and unreasonable."
"T
he Appellant claims that the Learned High Court Judge's decision goes against"
"the weight of the evidence presented in the case and that he failed to appreciate"
"the just and equitable nature of the order of the learned President of the Labour"
"Tribunal"
"R
espondentâ€™s Position"
"T
he  Respondent  asserts  that  the  termination  of  his  services  was  not  warranted"
"since 
the  decision 
to 
issue 
loans 
to 
the  beneficiaries  was  determined  by  a"
