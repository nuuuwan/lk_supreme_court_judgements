Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner-1st Respondent-Respondent (1st Respondent) filed this application in the

District Court of Colombo to wind up the 1st Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner (Petitioner).

This application was made on 19th March 2003 in terms of the Companies Act No. 17 of

1982 (Companies Act 1982).

By order dated 16th January 2009 the learned District Judge ordered the winding up of the

Petitioner. The Petitioner preferred an appeal to the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal

of the Western Province (Holden in Colombo) (High Court). When this appeal was taken

up for hearing, the Intervenient-Petitioner-2nd Respondent (2nd Respondent) raised a

preliminary objection that no right of appeal has been given to the Petitioner by

Companies Act No. 7 of 2007 (Companies Act 2007) to appeal against the winding up

order.

The High Court ruled that the issue must be decided by reference to section 532(1) of the

Companies Act 2007. It concluded that the provisions of the Companies Act 1982 were

applicable to the present case only for the purposes of winding up and that section 307

of the Companies Act 1982, which conferred a right of appeal against any order or decision

made up in winding up proceedings, was not open to the Petitioner. Accordingly, the High

Court upheld the preliminary objection and dismissed the appeal. The Petitioner

appealed.

Leave to appeal was granted on the following questions of law:

(1) Whether the impugned order is erroneous and incorrect in that, the conclusion

that no appeal would lie against a winding up order in the particular circumstances

of this case?

Page 6 of 18

(2) Whether the impugned order is erroneous and incorrect in that, the conclusion

that no appeal would lie against a winding up order in the particular circumstances

of this case on the basis that the Company law is a special law?

During the hearing, a further question of law was raised, namely:

(3) Assuming that the winding up order dated 16th January 2009 is appealable, is the

proper remedy a Leave to Appeal application?

Questions of Law No. 1 and 2

Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that section 532(1) of the Companies Act

2007 preserved the application of section 307 of the Companies Act 1982 to winding up

proceedings commenced under the said Act. Therefore, any order or decision made in

such winding up proceedings was subject to appeal.

In response, the learned counsel for the 1st Respondent and the Intervenient Petitioner-

2nd Respondent-Respondent (2nd Respondent) submitted that an appeal is a statutory right

and must be expressly created. Reliance was placed on the decisions in Martin v.

Wijewardena [(1989) 2 Sri.L.R. 409], Dassanayake v. Sampath Bank [(2002) 3 Sri.L.R.

268], Sangarapillai v. Chairman, Municipal Council of Colombo (32 NLR 92),

Vanderpoorten et al. v. The Settlement Officer (43 NLR 230), Kanagasunderam v.

Podihamine (42 NLR 97), Bakmeewewa, Authorized Officer of Peoples Bank v. Konarage

Raja [(1989) 1 Sri.L.R. 231],Gunaratne v. Thambinayagam and Others [(1993) 2 Sri.L.R.

355]. It was further contended that the Companies Law is a special law and that any right

of appeal should have been granted by the same law. In support of this proposition

reliance was placed upon the decision in Sirisena Perera and another v. Vinson Perera

[(2005) 1 Sri.L.R. 270]. It was contended that section 532(1) of the Companies Act 2007

did not keep alive all sections in the Companies Act 1982 and in particular did not provide

for the application of section 307 therein to the present case.

Page 7 of 18

There is no dispute that these winding up proceedings commenced in terms of the

Companies Act 1982 which provided a right of appeal against any order or decision made

in a winding up proceeding. The dispute is over the legal effect of the repeal of the

Companies Act 1982 by the Companies Act 2007.

The analysis must first take into account paragraph 6(3)(c) of the Interpretation Ordinance,

which reads as follows:

6(3)Whenever any written law repeals either in whole or part a former written law,

such repeal shall not, in the absence of any express provision to that effect, affect

or be deemed to have affected

(c) any action, proceeding, or thing pending or incompleted when the

repealing written law comes into operation, but every such action,

proceeding, or thing may be carried on and completed as if there had been

no such repeal.

The interpretation of this section raises two questions. First, we have to determine what

is meant by an action, procedure or thing, and whether winding up proceedings falls

under these words.

There is a divergence of opinion in some jurisdictions on whether a winding up proceeding

is an action in the context of the relevant legal provisions even though the same legal

provision was the subject of interpretation.

Page 8 of 18

Section 4(4) of the Limitation Ordinance, Cap. 347 of Hong Kong provided that:

An action shall not be brought upon any judgment after the expiration of 12

years from the date on which the judgment became enforceable, and no arrears

of interest in respect of any judgment debt shall be recovered after the expiration

of 6 years from the date on which the interest became due

Action is defined in section 2 of the said Ordinance as including any proceeding in a

court of law. In Re: Li Man Hoo [2013] 4 HKLRD 247 the Hong Kong Court of Appeal

held that a winding up petition falls within this definition. However, in England and

Australia, which has similar provisions, a more restrictive meaning has been adopted

and it has been held that the relevant limitation provision does not bar the presentation

of a winding-up petition. [See Ridgeway Motors (Isleworth) Ltd v ALTS Ltd [2005] 1

WLR 2871, Dennehy v Reasonable Endeavours Pty Ltd (2003) 130 FCR 494, OMara

Constructions Pty Ltd v Avery (2006) 230 ALR 581].

In Collett v. Priest [(1931) A. D. 290 at 298] De Villers, C. J., held that that the essential

feature of a 'suit or action' under section 50 of the Charter of Justice or under section 39

of Transvaal Proclamation 14 of 1902, or of a 'suit ' under section 24 of Cape Act 35 of

1896, is that it is a proceeding in which one party sues for or claims something from

another, and that no proceeding which lacks this feature, such as sequestration

proceedings, an application for winding up of a company etc., can be properly described

as a 'suit or action' or as a 'suit' under any of these sections.

The Interpretation Ordinance does not define what constitutes an action. According to

section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code, an action is a proceeding for the prevention or

redress of a wrong. One may ask whether this definition should be used to define the

word action in the Interpretation Ordinance.

Page 9 of 18

However, I do not believe there are any such difficulties in interpreting the word

proceeding in paragraph 6(3)(c) of the Interpretation Order, which is broader in scope. In

Perumawasam Silva et al. v. Balasingham (A. G. A., Kalutara) (53 NLR 421 at 423) it was

held that this section must be read in a wider sense. Hence, I hold that the present winding

up application falls within the word proceeding in section 6(3)(c) of the Interpretation

Ordinance.

The second issue is the meaning to be attributed to the words may be carried on and

completed as if there had been no such repeal. We must examine whether these words

are to be read, as meaning the culmination of the action, proceeding or thing in the

original court or as encompassing appellate proceedings as well.

Here, it is important to examine whether an appeal and the original action, proceeding or

thing are the same. An examination of the papers filed in this appeal reflects that as the

action advanced through different forums, both original and appellate, the caption filed

in the original court has been suitably adopted based on the respective petitioner or

respondent. This indicates that it is accepted in practice that an appeal is a continuation

of the initial action rather than a new proceeding or action.

Indeed, the common law position is that an appeal is not a fresh action but only a

continuation of the original proceedings and a stage in that action itself [See Garikapati

Veeraya v. Subbiah Choudhary and others (AIR 1957 SC 540), Shiv Shakti Co-op. Housing

Sociedty, Nagpur v. M/s Swaraj Developers and Others [AIR 2003 SC 2434],Malluru

Mallappa (D) THR. LRS. v. Kuruvathappa & Ors. (Civil Appeal 1485 of 2020)]. This view

has been adopted in Sudharman De Silva v Attorney General [(1986) 1 Sri LR 9 at 13],

W.L.M.N. De Alwis (Deceased) and others v. Malwatte Valley Plantations Ltd. and

another [SC/HCCA/LA 47/16, S.C.M. 21.06.2019].

Page 10 of 18

Accordingly, a reading of section 6(3)(c) of the Interpretation Ordinance in harmony with

this position in common law means that any repeal of any existing law shall not, in the

absence of any express provision to that effect, affect or be deemed to have affected any

action, proceeding or thing pending or incompleted when the repealing written law comes

into operation, and such action may be carried on and completed up to the conclusion of

the appeal as provided in the repealed law.

Therefore, I hold that in the absence of any express provision to that effect in the

Companies Act 2007, the repealing of the Companies Act 1982 by the Companies Act 2007

should not be interpreted to affect or be deemed to have affected the right of appeal

granted under section 307 of the Companies Act 1982.

There is another reason to require the express removal by the Companies Act 2007 of the

right of appeal provided by section 307 of the Companies Act 1982. The learned counsel

for the 1st and 2nd Respondents submitted that such right of appeal is procedural in nature

and not a vested right. Hence, it was contended that such a procedural right can be taken

away retrospectively. The following extract from Maxwell on The Interpretation of

Statute (12th ed., page 222) was cited in support:

No person has a vested right in any course of procedure, but only the right of

prosecution or defence in the manner prescribed for the time being, by or for

the court in which he sues, and if an Act of Parliament alters that mode of

procedure, he can only proceed according to the altered mode. Alteration in the

form of procedure are always retrospective, unless there is some good reason or

other why they should not be.

Page 11 of 18

However, a statutory right of appeal is not a mere procedural right but is a vested right.

An intention to interfere with or to impair or imperil such a vested right cannot be

presumed unless such intention be clearly manifested by express words or necessary

implication. [Messrs. Hoosein Kasam Dada (India) Ltd. v. The State of Madhya Pradesh

and Others (AIR 1953 SC 221), Garikapati Veeraya v. Subbiah Choudhary and others

(supra), Shiv Shakti Co-op. Housing Sociedty, Nagpur v. M/s Swaraj Developers and

Others (AIR 2003 SC 2434)].

In Akilandanayaki v. Sothinagaratnam (53 NLR 385 at 400) where Rose, C. J. held:

The combined effect of sections 6(3)(b) and 6(3)(c) of the Interpretation Ordinance

is that if a party had already instituted proceedings to vindicate a vested right, the

subsequent repeal of the enactment under which that right was acquired cannot

be regarded as operating retrospectively unless there are express words satisfying

both sub-sections.

In summary, there are two reasons to require that the right of appeal under section 307

of the Companies Act 1982 be expressly removed. One is the requirement in section

6(3)(c) of the Interpretation Ordinance. Second, a right of appeal is a vested right, and

therefore there must be explicit language to clearly express the intention to take away

that right of appeal.

Let me now examine whether such express taking away is seen in the Companies Act 2007.

Section 532(1) therein reads:

Subject to the provisions of subsection (2), the provisions of this Act with respect

to winding up shall not apply to any company of which the winding up has

commenced before the appointed date. Every such company shall be wound up in

the same manner and with the same incidents, as if this Act had not been enacted,

and for the purpose of the winding up, the written law under which the winding

up commenced shall be deemed to remain in full force. (Emphasis added)

Page 12 of 18

The learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents drew our attention to the words for

the purpose of the winding up and submitted that all what has been kept alive are the

provisions providing for the winding up in the Companies Act 1982. It was contended that

the right of appeal in section 307 of the Companies Act 1982 is not part of such provisions

and is not caught up within the words for the purpose of the winding up.

On the contrary, the learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that such an

interpretation would lead to grave and manifest injustice and absurdity as it would take

away a right of appeal from a party.

In this context it is interesting to observe the same formulation in section 532(1) of the

Companies Act 2007, section 452 of the Companies Act 1982 and section 366 of the

Companies Ordinance No. 51 of 1938 as amended. All these three Acts repealed the

previous applicable law. The words and for the purpose of the winding up are found in all

three sections.

Nevertheless, section 307 of the Companies Act 1982 provided for a right of appeal. I am

of the view that in these circumstances, those words cannot be used to interpret that they

expressly exclude the right of appeal in section 307 of the Companies Act. Moreover, when

an appeal is in law a continuation of the original proceedings as explained earlier, such an

interpretation is not possible.

Accordingly, I hold that the right of appeal recognized in terms of section 307 of the

Companies Act 1982 was not taken away in relation to the impugned winding up

proceedings that were to be continued in terms of section 532(1) of the Companies Act

2007.

Questions of law Nos. 1 and 2 are answered in the affirmative.

Page 13 of 18

Question of Law No. 3

Learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondent submitted that assuming a right of appeal

is available against the winding up order issued in the present case, it is not a final order

but only an interlocutory order. It was contended that section 307 of the Companies Act

1982 must be read with sections 754(1), (2) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Code and that

the remedy available to the Petitioner was to make a leave to appeal application and not

a final appeal. Reliance was placed on the decision in Chettiar v. Chettiar [(2011) BLR 25]

and H.B. Ajith Ariyadasa v. Paranawithana and another [C.A. (Rev.) 1695/06, C.A.M.

2.6.2009].

Section 307 of the Companies Act 1982 reads:

An appeal from any order or decision made or given in the winding up of a

company by the court under this Act shall lie to the Court of Appeal in the same

manner and subject to the same conditions, as an appeal from any order or decision

of the court made or given in the exercise of its ordinary civil jurisdiction.

The right of appeal is granted against any order or decision (if I may use that word

generically) made in a winding up of a company. It does not refer to a winding up order

per se. Nevertheless, the use of the word any therein makes it possible to give a wide

interpretation to catch all orders or decisions including an order for the winding up of a

company.

However, the learned counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents contended that the analysis

does not stop there and must go on to consider the provisions in sections 754(1), (2) and

(5) of the Civil Procedure Code. The words in the same manner and subject to the same

conditions in section 307 of the Companies Act 1982 was contended to be a reference to

the conditions specified in those sections. In particular, it was submitted that a right of

Page 14 of 18

appeal is available only in relation to a judgment whereas if it is an order, a leave to appeal

application is the only remedy.

I agree that section 307 of the Companies Act 1982 must be read with subsections 754(1),

(2) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Code. Therefore, we must consider whether the

impugned winding up order is a judgment or order within the meaning of these sections.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents cited the decision in H.B. Ajith Ariyadasa v. Paranawithana

and another (supra) where it was held that the proper application to be made was a leave

to appeal application in terms of section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. However, the

order impugned in that matter was not an order of winding up. It was an order directing

the petitioner to hand over goods listed in the inventory submitted by the liquidator.

In Chettiar v. Chettiar (supra. 31) it was held:

Therefore, to ascertain the nature of the decision made by a Civil Court as to

whether it is final or not, in keeping with the provisions of section 754(5) of the Civil

Procedure Code, it would be necessary to follow the test offered by Lord Esher MR

in Standard Discount Co. v. La Grange (supra) and as stated in Salaman v. Warner

(supra) which reads as follows:

The question must depend on what would be the result of the decision of

the Divisional Court assuming it to be given in favour of either of the parties.

If their decision, whichever way it is given, will, if it stands, finally dispose of

the matter in dispute, I think that for the purposes of these rules it is final.

On the other hand, if their decision, if given in one way, will finally dispose

of the matter in dispute, but if given in the other, will allow the action to go

on, then I think it is not final, but interlocutory.

Page 15 of 18

The Court adopted the application test adopted by English courts in determining whether

an order or decision is a final judgment. Therefore, the characterization of a winding up

order by the English courts must be examined.

In Re Reliance Properties Ltd Waygood, Otis and Co Ltd v Reliance Properties Ltd [(1951)

2 All ER 327] Evershed MR in placing a winding up order in its proper perspective held (at

327):

It would be difficult to think of any order made by the court which in substance or

character was more final than a winding up order.

Moreover, Halsbury's The Laws of England, 3rd edition (1954) Vol. 6 at 712, states:

an appeal from a winding up order maybe brought without leave of the court, as

the order is a final order and not a interlocutory judgment

This appears to have been the position in English common law even at the time the 4th

edition of this work was published in 1974 [See Halsbury's The Laws of England, 4th edition

(1974) Vol. 7 at 789. Nevertheless, Halsbury's Laws of England, 5th edition (2011) Vol (17)

at 255, state:

An appeal from a winding-up order made by a district judge or circuit judge of the

High Court or a registrar of the High Court requires permission of the first instance

judge or registrar or a High Court Judge, and permission is required from the judge

or the Court of Appeal from appeals from a High Court judge; the Court of Appeal

alone can grant permission where the decision of the High Court judge is itself made

on appeal

Page 16 of 18

The difference in approach appears to be based on the English rules of civil procedure,

which explicitly state the circumstances in which an application for leave to appeal should

be made. Therefore, the present position of English common law cannot be adopted here.

A more detailed analysis of the effect of a winding up order in terms of the Companies Act

1982 should be undertaken.

Winding up proceedings are sui generis in nature. It is distinct and different from an

ordinary action based on a cause of action. The impugned winding up proceedings have

been instituted on the basis that the Petitioner is unable to pay its debts. The District Court

decided to wind up the Petitioner. The appeal to the High Court was made by the

Petitioner against the that winding up order.

With respect to section 265 of the Companies Act 1982, such an order to wind up works

in favour of all of the Petitioner's creditors and contributors. It is thus clear that the

impugned winding up proceedings are a remedy provided to all creditors and

contributors. The substantive issue to be resolved in this winding up proceedings is

whether the Petitioner is unable to pay its debts. The impugned winding up order was

made by the Court after determining that central issue. In fact, it is an issue which goes to

the jurisdiction of the Court.

Moreover, the effect of a winding up order cannot be overlooked in determining whether

it is a final judgment within the meaning of sections 754(1) and (5) of the Civil Procedure

Code. When a winding up order is made, the servants of the company are ipso facto

dismissed [Chapmans case (1886) L.R. 1 Eq. 346, Measures Bros. Ltd. v. Measures (1910)

2 Ch. 248, Gosling v. Gaskell (1897) AC 575] and results in the dismissal of the directors

and the cessation of their powers [Re Union Accident Insurance Co Ltd (1972) 1 All ER

1105, Fowler v. Broads Patent Night Light Co (1893) 1 Ch 724].

Page 17 of 18

There is no doubt that significant steps need to be taken thereafter to complete the

winding up proceedings, such as the appointment of liquidators. Nevertheless, as Williams

LJ held in In Re Herbert Reeves & Co. [(1902) 1 Ch. 29 at 31]:

the mere fact that there may be inquiries to be carried out after the order or

after the judgment has been delivered does not prevent the order or the judgment

from being a final order or final judgment. After you have got an order for winding

up a company, there are obviously an enormous quantity of questions which may

be raised

However, learned counsel for the Respondents drew our attention to several sections of

the Companies Act 1982 and contended that a winding up order is not a final judgment.

Section 287 grants power to the same court which issued the winding up order to stay the

winding up proceedings altogether or for a limited time on such terms and conditions as

the court thinks fit. Section 372 gives the Court the power to declare the dissolution of

the company void. It was contended that the final judgment is when the Court dissolves

a company consequent to an application made by the liquidator under section 304.

I am not convinced that any one of these sections negate a finding that the impugned

winding up order is a final judgment within the meaning of sections 754(1) and (5) of the

Civil Procedure Code. Section 287 empowers the Court only to stay the winding up

proceedings in given circumstances. It does not grant power to the Court to vary a winding

up order. In fact, in Re Intermain Properties Ltd. [(1986) BCLC 265 Ch D.] it was held that

the Court has no jurisdiction to rescind a perfected winding up order.

No doubt, section 372 empowers the Court to declare the dissolution void. But there is a

clear distinction between an order for winding up and an order for dissolution. A winding

up order does not result in the extinction of the company [See Employers Liability

Assurance and Corpn. v. Sedgwick Collins Co. [(1927) AC 95]. A company ceases to exist

Page 18 of 18

only upon an order made for dissolution in terms of section 304(1) of the Companies Act

1982.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the impugned winding up order is a final judgment

within the meaning of sections 754(1) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Question of law No. 3 is answered in the negative.

For avoidance of any doubt and to ensure clarity, I have only made a finding that a winding

up order made by the Court in terms of the Companies Act 1982 in any winding up

proceedings instituted against a company due to its failure to pay its debts is a judgment

within the meaning of sections 754(1) and (5) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Accordingly, I set aside the judgment of the High Court dated 7th June 2011. I direct the

High Court to hear and dispose of the Petitioner's appeal on the merits expeditiously. The

High Court shall make every reasonable endeavour to conclude the appeal by the

Petitioner within a reasonable time. The High Court shall give priority to this matter with

a view to concluding it expeditiously.

The Petitioner is entitled to the costs of this appeal.

Appeal allowed.
