"Notary  Public  thereby  committed  the  offence  of  cheating  under  Section  400  of  the"
"Penal Code"
"b) Making a false document which was dead No. 259 and thereby committed the offence"
"forgery, punishable under Section 454 of the Penal Code"
"In  my  opinion,  this  evidence  would  have  influenced  the  result  of  the  case  since  the"
"authenticity  of  deed  No.259  is  central  to  the  Plaintiff’s  case.  The  Plaintiff  sought  a"
"declaration  in  the  District  Court  that  deed  No.  259  of  26.05.1992  was  fraudulently"
"executed  by  the  1st  Defendant  and  she  along  with  the  two  other  co-accused  were"
"convicted in the Magistrate Court. I am further of the view that the offence for which the"
"1st Defendant was convicted, and the subject matter complained of by the Plaintiff in the"
"District Court are the same, therefore, would have an important influence if not direct,"
"on the outcome of the case."
"Credibility of the Evidence"
"Needless  to  say,  a  judgement  of  a  competent  Court  would  be  credible  evidence.  A"
"competent Court would enter judgment after careful evaluation of the facts and relevant"
"legal principles. Moreover, a criminal conviction, as in the instant Appeal, would carry"
"a higher burden of proof and would be a credible item of evidence in a subsequent civil"
"proceeding if the judgement is relevant."
"In my view, the conjunctive criteria provided above are satisfied  by the Plaintiff.  The"
"Court of Appeal, however, held that once the 1st Defendant passed away the Appeal was"
"left in “limbo” and Section 41A (2) of the Evidence Ordinance has no application. the"
"Court of Appeal held that;"
"“The provision makes it clear that only two categories of convictions become relevant."
