"(2)  The  evidence  must  be  such  that,  if  given,  it  would  probably  have  an  important"
"influence on the result of the case, although it may not be decisive."
"(3) The evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed or, in other words, it must"
"be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible."
"Reasonable Diligence"
"The first criterion requires the Appellant to satisfy the Court that the evidence could not"
"have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial. Our system is one of"
"adversarial, the litigant must present before the Court with the evidence to prove his or"
"her case to satisfy the evidentiary burden embodied in the provisions of Chapter IX of the"
"Evidence Ordinance as applicable. Fresh evidence will not be admitted merely because"
"the result of the first trial was or may have been occasioned by the unsuccessful party’s"
"inattention, or due to an innocent mistake. The opposing party has no duty to atone for"
"the litigant’s mistakes, and the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the errand litigant."
"In the instant Appeal, however, it is apparent that the evidence was not available, as the"
"Plaintiff concluded his case on 02.07.1997 and the convictions against the 1st Defendant,"
"namely for forgery and the other two co-accused were entered on 25.05.1999, in the"
"Magistrate Court. Therefore, I am of the opinion the first condition referred to above, is"
"satisfied."
"Influence of the Evidence"
"The Amendment to the Evidence Ordinance by Act No. 33 of 1998, made a conviction in"
"a Criminal Court a relevant fact in a Civil Court. A conviction is admissible evidence in"
"a civil suit where the fact that he (the person who is so convicted) has committed the acts"
"constituting the offence is a fact in issue."
"The 1st Defendant and the co-accused were convicted in the Magistrate Court [in case"
"No. 59322/1 (marked F 1)] of the following charges;"
"a) Falsely representing a person unknown to the complaint as Hettiarachchige Dominic"
