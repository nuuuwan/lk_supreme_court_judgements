"The Court of Appeal held further that;"
"“What the Plaintiff-Appellant seeks to have admitted is a conviction that appealed against"
"but not adjudicated upon or affirmed as a result of the demise of 1st Defendant. Had the"
"eventuality of the death of the 1st Defendant not intervened, there would have been two"
"possibilities. Either the conviction would have been affirmed or it would have been set"
"aside. Such a conviction which was left in limbo cannot fall within either category (a) or"
"(b) contemplated by Section 41A (2). When the 1st Defendant (who was the 1st accused"
"i
n
 
t
he MC prosecution) passed away, her conviction was neither unappealed nor can it"
"be said to have been affirmed in appeal.”"
