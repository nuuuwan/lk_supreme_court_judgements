Judgement

Aluwihare, P.C., J

The Defendant-Appellant-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter the Defendant) sought

Leave to Appeal against the Judgement of the Civil Appellate High Court of Kandy,

which upheld the Judgment of the District Court of Kandy.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter the Plaintiff) filed action in the

District Court of Kandy under Chapter LIII of the Civil Procedure Code to recover a

liquidated sum of Rs. 184, 000 /- on a promissory note together with a further sum

of Rs. 36, 800 /- and legal interest until the due execution of the decree. Summons

were issued to the Defendant and the Defendant applied to court by way of a petition

and affidavit for leave to appear and defend the action. The District Court allowed the

Defendant to file an answer upon furnishing security and the Defendant sought to

dismiss the action.

The Defendant by way of his answer admitted that the money-transaction took place

but denied placing the signature on the Promissory Note and Deed No. 958 and

4

contended that the signatures are forgeries. Defendant sought by way of a prayer to

the Answer an order that the impugned promissory note be forwarded to the Examiner

of Questioned Documents (hereinafter the EQD) for examination and a report to be

tendered to Court. The contention of the Plaintiff on the other hand was that the

Defendant placed his signature on the Promissory Note as well as the Deed No. 958

on the same day. The Deed was for an unrelated transaction and

Hapugaskuburegedara Samel was a witness for both transactions.

To issue a Commission on the EQD sample signatures were tendered before the

Registrar of the Court by the Defendant on 15.09.2006 but the EQD by a letter dated

27.11.2006 informed the Learned District Judge that the sample signatures were

dissimilar from the document in question and requested the signatures of the

Defendant in the ordinary course of affairs. Thereafter the Defendant provided the

sample signatures along with amended draft Commission papers by way of a Motion

dated 29.05.2007. The application was allowed by the Learned District Judge.

Subsequently, it was reported that Deed No. 958 had been misplaced which was kept

at the Registry for safekeeping and the Commission on the EQD was also not

forthcoming. Eventually the document was found in the custody of the Registry. It

seems owing to the administrative lapses and the Defendants conduct a conclusive

Commission of the EQD was unavailable.

On 27.08.2012 as the Defendant was absent and unrepresented, the case was fixed

for ex-parte trial against the Defendant and the Plaintiff closed his case on that day.

The Defendants contention is that he was unable to retain representation as

Attorneys- at- Law in his locality that he approached, refused to take up the matter

due to the concerns of a fraudulent Deed executed by a member of the legal fraternity.

The Learned District Judge, after considering the evidence, entered judgement in

favour of the Plaintiff. The Learned District Judge, came to this conclusion mainly

based on the evidence provided by the witness Samel and based on Deed No.958,

which was a duly registered instrument in the Land Registry, hence held that the

Promissory Note was genuine and was duly presented for payment (vide p. 166 to

168 of the Brief).

The Defendant being aggrieved by the said Judgement preferred an Appeal to the

Provincial High Court of Kandy. The Learned Judges of the High Court upheld the

judgement of the District Court by judgment dated 02.03.2016.

5

Consequently, the Defendant filed a Leave to Appeal application to this Court and the

Court granted leave on 26.07.2016 for the following questions of law set out in sub-

paragraphs (b) and (c) of paragraph 18 of the Petition of the Defendant;

(1) Did the High Court err in upholding the conclusion of the District Court that the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent has satisfactorily proved that a notice of dishonour

has been given in respect of an action based on a Promissory note?

(2) Did the High Court err in upholding the conclusion of the District Court that the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent has complied with the mandatory requirements of

the Bills of Exchange Ordinance to succeed in enforcing a Promissory note?

Before considering the merits of the Defendants case I will consider the preliminary

objection raised by the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant was not

entitled to prefer this appeal to this Court as the Defendant had not moved to have the

ex-parte judgement of the District Court set aside in terms of Section 84 of the Civil

Procedure Code and that in terms of Section 88(1) no appeal lies against any

judgement entered upon default .

It was argued that as per Section 88(1) of the Civil Procedure Code an ex-parte

judgement is not appealable and the party in default must apply against the judgement

in the same Court for an order setting aside judgment. As held by His Lordship Justice

Samayawardhena in Geethika Sudhirani Samaraweera v Uduruwangala Gedarage

Charaka SC/APPEAL/78/2021 (S.C Minutes 21.11.2022) at p. 6;

In terms of section 88(1) No appeal shall lie against any judgment entered upon

default. This means a final appeal cannot be filed from an ex parte judgment entered

against a defendant for failure to file answer or for want of appearance of the

defendant on the trial date. A final appeal also cannot be filed from a judgment

entered against a plaintiff for want of appearance on the trial date. In such a situation,

if the defaulter is the defendant an application under section 86(2) or if the defaulter

is the plaintiff an application under section 87(3) shall first be made to purge the

default before contesting the case of the opposite party on the merits.

However, as stated earlier, the Plaintiff for reasons best known for her never took up

this objection when the matter was argued before the High Court of Civil Appeals and

chose to participate in the proceedings before it.

6

This Court is now called upon to consider the impugned judgement of the High Court

of Civil Appeals which was an inter-parte proceeding. When this matter was

supported for leave to proceed, neither the preliminary objection taken at the outset

nor did the Defendant- Respondent raise a question of law on this point when the

matter was supported.

In my view, the failure to object to the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court

amounts to a waiver and the Plaintiff is estopped by their conduct. It was held in

Nawinna Kottage Dona Lalitha Padmini v. N.K.D. Pradeepa Nishanthi Kumari

SC/HC/CA/LA No. 134/2016 (S.C Minutes 07.09.2018) that a party that failed to

object to an appeal filed out of time amounts to waiver of such objections. It was held

by His Lordship Priyantha Jayawardena at p.13 that;

The Petitioners raised the time bar objection for the first time in the Supreme Court.

Therefore, it must be considered if the Petitioners are estopped by their conduct from

raising the time bar objection before the Supreme Court.

According to C.D. Fields Law relating to estoppel revised by Gopal S. Chaturvedi,

3rd Ed, page 166;

In order to constitute abandonment or waiver, it must be a voluntary act on the part

of the person possessing the rights. Acquiescence or standing by when there is a duty

to speak or assert a right creates an estoppel. In such cases knowledge of the act must

be brought by the acquiescing party. Acquiescence does not mean simply an

intelligent consent, but may be implied if a person is content not to oppose irregular

acts which he knows are being done.

Therefore, waiver of an objection by a party aggrieved does not afford them the right

to raise such objection at a later stage, as they are estopped by their prior conduct.

Similarly, once the Plaintiff failed to object to the jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court, the Plaintiff is estopped. For the aforementioned reasons I shall proceed to

consider the questions of law on which leave to appeal was granted without

considering the preliminary objection.

The only contention of the Defendant was that a notice of dishonour was not given by

the Plaintiff within a reasonable period of time. The Defendant, however, did not

7

assert this position in the District Court or the High Court and took up the position for

the first time before this Court.

A promissory note is defined in Section 85(1) of the Bills of exchange Ordinance as;

A promissory note is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to

another signed by the maker, engaging to pay, on demand or at a fixed or

determinable future time, a sum certain in money, to, or to the order of, a specified

person or to bearer.

The principal differences of a promissory note from other bills as stated by William

and Richard Hedley Bill of Exchange and Bankers Documentary Credits (4th edn at

p. 148) is that

The basic difference between a promissory note and any other bills is that a note is a

promise by the maker to pay, whereas an ordinary bill is an order to someone else

(that is the drawee) to pay.

Meanwhile, the object of notice of dishonour is to prevent prejudice to the drawer or

indorser, as stated in Byles on Bills of Exchange and Cheques (27th Edition at

page155);

The object of notice is to inform the party, to whom notice is given that the holder or

the party giving notice looks to him for payment. The rationale being that, where the

bill has not been accepted or paid the drawer or indorser will be prejudiced if no such

notice is given. There is no need though for the drawer or indorser to show prejudice,

since the requirement to give notice is an absolute one

The requirement to give a notice of dishonour is stipulated in Section 48 of the Bills

of Exchange Ordinance. The Section provides;

Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, when a bill has been dishonoured by

non-acceptance or by non-payment, notice of dishonour must be given to the drawer

and each indorser, and any drawer or indorser to whom such notice is not given is

discharged:

Provided that-

8

(a) where a bill is dishonoured by non-acceptance, and notice of dishonour is not

given, the rights of a holder in due course subsequently to the omission, shall not be

prejudiced by the omission;

(b) where a bill is dishonoured by non-acceptance and due notice of dishonour is

given, it shall not be necessary to give notice of a subsequent dishonour by non-

payment unless the bill shall in the meantime have been accepted.

Therefore, it is explicit that, as in the case of dishonour by non-acceptance, so also in

that of dishonour by non-payment, notice of dishonour must be given to the drawer

and each indorser; otherwise, the drawer or any indorser to whom such notice is not

given is discharged. However, in certain circumstances a party can be excused from

providing a notice. Section 50(2) of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance provides that a

notice can be dispensed with if;

Notice of dishonour is dispensed with -

(a) When, after the exercise of reasonable diligence, notice as required by this

Ordinance cannot be given to or does not reach the drawer or indorser sought to be

charged ;

(b) By waiver express or implied. Notice of dishonour may be waived before the time

of giving notice has arrived, or after the omission to give due notice ;

(c) As regards the drawer in the following cases, namely -

(i) where drawer and drawee are the same person,

(ii) where the drawee is a fictitious person or a person not having capacity to contract,

(iii) where the drawer is the person to whom the bill is presented for payment,

(iv) where the drawee or acceptor is as between himself and the drawer under no

obligation to accept or pay the bill,

(v) where the drawer has countermanded payment;

(d) As regards the indorser in the following cases, namely -

(i) where the drawee is a fictitious person or a person not having capacity to contract,

and the indorser was aware of the fact at the time he indorsed the bill,

9

(ii) where the indorser is the person to whom the bill is presented for payment,

(iii) where the bill was accepted or made for his accommodation

A notice of dishonour can be dispensed when the drawee and the drawer are the same

person. When the drawer is also the drawee and the drawee refuses payment

obviously the drawer will already know, hence there is no need to give notice of

dishonour. That situation corresponds where a promissory note is made between the

maker of the note and another. In this regard, Byles on Bills of Exchange and

Cheques (27th Edition at page178) states;

As set out in S.5(2) of the 1882 Act where in a bill the drawee and the drawer are

the same person the holder may treat the instrument either as a bill or as a note. If the

holder elects to treat the instrument as a bill there is no reason why he should be given

notice of dishonour, in his capacity as drawer, since, in his capacity as drawee, he is

responsible for the non-acceptance or non-payment of the bill. Thus, notice is

expressly dispensed with (Equally no notice need be given if the instrument is treated

as a note, since the person is the maker of the note and thereby corresponds with the

acceptor of a bill, to whom notice need not be given)

The above position also corresponds under the Bills of Exchange Ordinance. As stated

in Section 91(2);

In applying those provisions the maker of a note shall be deemed to correspond with

the acceptor of a bill, and the first indorser of a note shall be deemed to correspond

with the drawer of an accepted bill payable to drawers order

Hence, the contention of the Defendant is without merit as there is no requirement to

provide a notice of dishonor for a promissory note. The Defendant heavily relied on

Senanayake v Abdul Cader 74 N.L.R. 255 and Ceylon Estate Agency v De Alwis 70

N.L.R 30. The case of Senanayake [supra] was an action upon a cheque where no

notice of dishonour was averred in the plaint and the Court dismissed the action

owing to the defect. However, that judgment is not applicable to the instant appeal

since the present action is upon a promissory note and not a cheque. In Ceylon Estate

Agency [supra], a notice of dishonour was not given in an action for a promissory

note and the Court dismissed the cause of action owing to the defect. That judgement

can be distinguished from the present appeal since the Court was concerned with

10

notice to the indorser of the note. His Lordship Justice L.B. De Silva in Ceylon Estate

Agency at page 39 stated;

We hold that in an action on a promissory note where presentment for payment is

necessary, to make the maker and indorsers liable, it is a necessary averment in the

plaint that the promissory note was duly presented for payment and was dishonoured.

If there was any excuse for not presenting the promissory note for payment, such

excuse should be pleaded. As against the indorsers, the plaint must further aver that

notice of dishonour was given to them, unless there was an excuse for not giving such

notice, when such excuse should be pleaded. Even if the court is to take a liberal view

of the pleadings, the defect should at least be cured by raising the appropriate issues

on these matters unless these facts are admitted by the defendants.

In the present case the Defendant is the maker of the note and not the indorser, hence

the judgement of Ceylon Estate Agency is not applicable.

In any event, I am of the view that the Defendant was provided with sufficient notice.

The Defendant admits the receipt of a Letter of Demand dated 22.06.2003 (vide.

Admissions of the Parties p. 90 of the Brief marked E). However, the Defendant

contends that the said Letter of Demand was not marked at the trial by the Plaintiff

because the said Letter of Demand was misplaced, and the Learned Judge could not

evaluate or analyze the contents. Further, it was stated by the Defendant that contents

of the documents cannot be proved by oral evidence as per Section 59 of the Evidence

Ordinance (as amended). It was also argued by the Defendant that Section 49(5) of

the Bills of Exchange Ordinance requires the notice of dishonor to sufficiently identify

the bill and intimate the bill was dishonored by non-acceptance or non-payment. In

the absence of the said Letter of Demand, the Defendant contends that Section 49(5)

of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance, is not complied with by the Plaintiff.

As held by His Lordship Justice Nawaz in T.M Tennakoon v Seemitha Nuwara Eliya

District Sakasuruwam and Naya Ganudenu Samupakara Samithiya C.A. Case No.

751/2000 (F) (C.A Minutes 20.05.2016) at p. 7 a notice of dishonor must be

distinguished from a Letter of Demand.

Notice of dishonor must be distinguished from a Letter of Demand. It is necessary

to make a demand by way of a Letter of Demand but it is equally necessary to give

11

notice of dishonour when a cheque is dishonoured. Section 47 (2) of the Bills of

Exchange Ordinance enacts:

Subject to the provisions of the Ordinance, when a bill is dishonoured by

non~payment, an immediate right of recourse against the drawer and indorsers

accrues to the holder.

Section 48 of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance stipulates the requirement for a notice

of dishonor. This provision contains not only the requirement of a notice of dishonour

but also the effect of not giving such notice.

Hence, it is apparent that a Letter of Demand per say would not amount to a notice of

dishonour unless the necessary requirements of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance are

complied with by a plaintiff. However, it was contended by the Plaintiff that she met

the Defendant multiple times and attempted to present the note for payment, but the

Defendant refused (vide proceedings on 25.08.2006, p. 98 of the Brief). The

Defendant did not deny this position nor was it controverted by any other evidence.

The Plaintiff states that this amounts to a sufficient notice of dishonour communicated

by personal communication. I am inclined to agree with this view.

Section 49(5) of the Bills of Exchange Ordinance states;

The notice may be given in writing or by personal communication and may be given

in any terms which sufficiently identify the bill and intimate that the bill has been

dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-payment

In Metcalfe v Richardson (1852) 11 CB 1011 on the day after a bill became due, the

holder's clerk called upon the drawer, and told him that the bill had been duly

presented, and that the acceptor "could not pay it" to which the drawer replied that

"he would see the holder about it:" It was held at p. 775 by Maule J that;

The clerk, it is true, does not say that the bill has been dishonoured, or is unpaid; but

that Dalgleish, the acceptor, cannot pay it. He assumes that he has duly ascertained

that: and it is plain that the sense in which the plaintiff understands the

communication is, that he is called upon to pay the bill. He treats it as a notice that

the acceptor has not paid the bill, and that he himself is called upon to pay. Therefore,

we have the fact of the bill being dishonoured, and of the drawer's being informed of

the acceptor's incapacity to pay, as being established, and that the drawer is looked to

12

for payment. And, when the plaintiff, in reply to the communication so made to him,

says, I will see Mr. Richardson about it I think no jury could come to any other

conclusion than that he considered and accepted it, as it evidently was intended, as a

notice of dishonour.

The Court states further that;

It was competent to them to assume, and it was properly left to them to infer from

the conversation deposed to, that the plaintiff had had notice of dishonour, and that

he would be looked to for payment of the bill, which is the material part of the notice.

I therefore think there should be no rule that it was proper to infer from this

conversation that the drawer had due notice of dishonour.

In my opinion, similar to Metcalfe v Richardson (supra) once the Plaintiff attempted

to present the note and the Defendant refused, this amounted to sufficient notice of

dishonour. Hence, I am of the view it is proper to infer that sufficient notice of

dishonour was given.

Conclusion

For the reasons stated above, I answer the questions of law upon which leave to appeal

was granted as follows;

(1) Did the High Court err in upholding the conclusion of the District Court that the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent has satisfactorily proved that a notice of dishonour

has been given in respect of an action based on a Promissory note?

No

(2) Did the High Court err in upholding the conclusion of the District Court that the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent has complied with the mandatory requirements of

the Bills of Exchange Ordinance to succeed in enforcing a Promissory note?

No

Appeal dismissed.
