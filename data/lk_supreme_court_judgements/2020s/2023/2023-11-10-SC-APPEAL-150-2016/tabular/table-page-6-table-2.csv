"SC/HC/CA/LA No. 134/2016 (S.C Minutes 07.09.2018) that a party that failed to"
"object to an appeal filed out of time amounts to waiver of such objections. It was held"
"by His Lordship Priyantha Jayawardena at p.13 that;"
"“The Petitioners raised the time bar objection for the first time in the Supreme Court."
"Therefore, it must be considered if the Petitioners are estopped by their conduct from"
"raising the time bar objection before the Supreme Court."
"According to C.D. Field’s ‘Law relating to estoppel’ revised by Gopal S. Chaturvedi,"
"3rd Ed, page 166;"
