"f
or payment. And, when the plaintiff, in reply to the communication so made to him,"
"says, ‘I will see Mr. Richardson about it’ I think no jury could come to any other"
"conclusion than that he considered and accepted it, as it evidently was intended, as a"
"notice of dishonour.”"
"The Court states further that;"
"“
I
t
 was competent to them to assume, and it was properly left to them to infer from"
"t
he conversation deposed to, that the plaintiff had had notice of dishonour, and that"
"he would be looked to for payment of the bill, which is the material part of the notice."
"I
 therefore think there should be no rule that it was proper to infer from this"
"conversation that the drawer had due notice of dishonour.”"
"In my opinion, similar to Metcalfe v Richardson (supra) once the Plaintiff attempted"
"to present the note and the Defendant refused, this amounted to sufficient notice of"
"dishonour.  Hence,  I  am  of  the  view  it  is  proper  to  infer  that  sufficient  notice  of"
"dishonour was given."
"Conclusion"
"For the reasons stated above, I answer the questions of law upon which leave to appeal"
"was granted as follows;"
"(1) Did the High Court err in upholding the conclusion of the District Court that the"
"Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent has satisfactorily proved that a notice of dishonour"
"has been given in respect of an action based on a Promissory note?"
"No"
"(2) Did the High Court err in upholding the conclusion of the District Court that the"
"Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent has complied with the mandatory requirements of"
"the Bills of Exchange Ordinance to succeed in enforcing a Promissory note?"
"No"
"Appeal dismissed."
