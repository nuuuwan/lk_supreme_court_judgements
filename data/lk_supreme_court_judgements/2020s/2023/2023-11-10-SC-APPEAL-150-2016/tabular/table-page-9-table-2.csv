"obviously  the  drawer  will  already  know,  hence  there  is  no  need  to  give  notice  of"
"dishonour. That situation corresponds where a promissory note is made between the"
"maker  of  the  note  and  another.  In  this  regard,  “Byles on Bills of Exchange and"
"Cheques” (27th Edition at page178) states;"
"“As set out in S.5(2) of the 1882 Act where in a bill the drawee and the drawer are"
"t
he same person the holder may treat the instrument either as a bill or as a note. If the"
"holder elects to treat the instrument as a bill there is no reason why he should be given"
"notice of dishonour, in his capacity as drawer, since, in his capacity as drawee, he is"
"responsible for the non-acceptance or non-payment of the bill. Thus, notice is"
"expressly dispensed with (Equally no notice need be given if the instrument is treated"
"as a note, since the person is the maker of the note and thereby corresponds with the"
"acceptor of a bill, to whom notice need not be given)”"
