"[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 10 of 13"
"to 
the  basis  on  which 
the  1st  accused  could  have 
reposed"
"confidence  in  his  Counsel  who  had  also  taken  instructions  to"
"defend the 3rd, 4th and 5th accused. This is a grave incriminating"
"circumstance that should have been taken into consideration as an"
"item of evidence against the 1st accused."
"The joint representation entered by a single Counsel applies to the"
"3rd,  4th  and  5th  accused  vice  versa. 
In 
this  background, 
the"
"prosecution  has 
invited  us 
to 
take  notice  of 
this  unusual"
"arrangement made to represent the accused by one single Counsel,"
"as a relevant fact against them as well in determining their degree"
"of responsibility in the commission of the crimes. Considering the"
"extreme unusual conduct of the 1st accused and others, I am of the"
"opinion that it constitutes strong incriminating evidence falling into"
"the category of subsequent conduct of the accused."
"I have stated that a President’s Counsel had appeared for all the"
"accused in the High Court until 08.09.2005. It is thereafter that the"
"appearance had been marked separately for the 1st accused and"
"others.  After  this  date  until  the  conclusion  of  the  trial,  the  same"
"President’s Counsel continued to enter his appearance for the 1st"
"accused and quite surprisingly his junior in the case, ceased to be"
"his Junior Counsel and took over case of the other accused. This"
"clearly  shows  that  the  cure  provided  was  even  worse  that  the"
"disease. The conspiracy between the 1st accused and the others,"
"particularly 
the 
4th 
accused 
is 
quite 
apparent 
from 
this"
"arrangement.  This  being  relevant  to  the  fact  in  issue,  cannot  be"
"ignored in determining the degree of culpability of the accused. As"
"this is borne out by  the record of the Magistrate Court  and High"
"Court none can say that it is not proved to the required standard."
