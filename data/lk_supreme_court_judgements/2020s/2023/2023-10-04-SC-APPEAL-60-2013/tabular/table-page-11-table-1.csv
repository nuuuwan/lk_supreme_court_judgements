"[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 11 of 13"
"influenced the mind of the Judges of the Court of Appeal. This factor appears"
"to have ultimately prompted them to arrive at a different conclusion in respect"
"of the 4th Accused which had resulted in a different treatment meted out to"
"the 4th Accused as against the 3rd Accused despite the fact that the evidence"
"against each one of them remains the same."
"Let me now deal with the conclusion arrived at by the learned Judges of the"
"Court  of  Appeal  about  the  presence  of  evidence  of  a  recovery  of  a  revolver"
"subsequent to ‘Section 27 statement’ made by the 4th  Accused. Admittedly,"
"the 4th Accused had surrendered with an Attorney-at-Law to the police station"
"at  9.00  pm,  fifteen  days  after  the  incident.  We  also  observe  that  the  police"
"officer  had  recorded  the  statement  from  the  4th  Accused  at  9.15  pm,  just"
"fifteen  minutes  after  the  time  he  had  surrendered  to  Maharagama  police"
"station. It is this statement which had contained the  ‘Section 27 statement’"
"which  is  alleged  to  have  led  to  the  recovery  of  a  revolver  from  a  particular"
"place. Having regard to: the time at which the 4th Accused had surrendered"
"to the Police Station; the time at which his statement had been recorded; the"
"background of the evidence regarding the identity of the Accused coming from"
"a  solitary  witness  who  says  at  one  point  of  time  that  the  4th  Accused  was"
"wearing a mask, it is highly questionable as to whether it is right for the Court"
"of Appeal to place that much of reliance on the ‘Section 27 statement’ and the"
"subsequent recovery of a revolver to come to a conclusion that the identity of"
"the 4th Accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt. In any event,"
"as pointed out by the learned President’s Counsel for the 4th Accused, even if"
"the evidence of a recovery of a revolver subsequent to ‘Section 27 statement’"
"made by the 4th Accused is accepted, it is clear that the effect of the ‘Section"
"27  statement’  and  the  subsequent  recovery  is  limited  only  to  the  inference"
"that  the  4th  Accused  had  knowledge  of  the  particular  revolver  concealed  or"
"placed  at  that  particular  location.  That  would  be  an  independent  item  of"
"evidence.  Moreover,  although  the  learned  Judges  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in"
"their judgment at page 50, had stated that “According to the evidence of the"
"government analysts P3 is a revolver and it is a gun within the meaning of the"
"law  and  the  two  bullets  recovered  from  the  body  of  the  deceased  may  have"
"been  fired  from  the  said  revolver”.  It  is  clear  that  this  is  also  not  a  correct"
"conclusion."
