ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 04th October 2023

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

Court heard the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th

Accused-Appellant-Appellant and also the submissions of the learned

Additional Solicitor General, PC for the Hon. Attorney General and concluded

the argument.

The Attorney General has indicted the 4th Accused-Appellant-Appellant along

with five others under fifteen counts.

Count No. 01 has alleged that the Accused had committed the conspiracy

to commit the attempted murder of Pattiyawattage Nimal Perera

Samarasinghe who is the prosecution witness No. 01 listed in the

[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 4 of 13

4

indictment, an offence punishable under section 300 read with sections

113 B and 102 of the Penal Code.

Count No. 02 has alleged that the Accused had been members of an

unlawful assembly, the common object of which was to cause the death

of Deepthi Champa Samarasinghe, an offence punishable under Section

300 of the Penal Code.

Count No. 03 has alleged that the Accused had committed an offence

punishable under Section 296 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code

on the basis that one or more of the members of the afore-said unlawful

assembly had committed the offence of murder by causing the death of

said Deepthi Champa Samarasinghe in furtherance of the common object

of the said unlawful assembly.

Count No. 04 has alleged that the Accused had committed an offence

punishable under Section 300 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code

on the basis that one or more of the members of the afore-said unlawful

assembly had committed the offence of attempted murder of said

Pattiyawattage Nimal Perera Samarasinghe (who is the prosecution

witness No. 01) in furtherance of the common object of the afore-said

unlawful assembly.

Count No. 05 has alleged that the Accused had committed an offence

punishable under Section 380 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code

on the basis that one or more of the members of the afore-said unlawful

assembly had committed the offence of robbery of cash, gold jewellary

and wrist watches from the possession of said Pattiyawattage Nimal

Perera Samarasinghe (prosecution witness No. 01) in furtherance of the

common object of the afore-said unlawful assembly.

Count No. 06 has alleged that the Accused had committed an offence

punishable under Section 443 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code

on the basis that one or more of the members of the afore-said unlawful

assembly had committed the offence of criminal trespass on the house of

[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 5 of 13

5

said Pattiyawattage Nimal Perera Samarasinghe (prosecution witness

No. 01) in furtherance of the common object of the afore-said unlawful

assembly.

Count No. 07 has alleged that the Accused had committed an offence

punishable under Section 445 read with Section 146 of the Penal Code

on the basis that one or more of the members of the afore-said unlawful

assembly had trespassed on the house of said Pattiyawattage Nimal

Perera Samarasinghe (prosecution witness No. 01) in order to commit the

attempted murder of said Pattiyawattage Nimal Perera Samarasinghe in

furtherance of the common object of the afore-said unlawful assembly.

Count Nos. 08, 09, 10, 11 and 12 are counts framed under Section 32 of

the Penal Code corresponding to the same incidents set out respectively

in afore-mentioned counts 3-7.

Count No. 13 has alleged that the 03rd Accused had committed robbery

while being armed with a pistol, an offence punishable under Section 383

of the Penal Code.

Count No. 14 has alleged that the 04th Accused had committed robbery

while being armed with a pistol, an offence punishable under Section 383

of the Penal Code.

Count No. 15 has alleged that the 05th Accused had committed robbery

while being armed with a knife, an offence punishable under Section 383

of the Penal Code.

The 14th and 15th counts are in relation to the offence of robbery

punishable under Section 383 of the Penal Code. (Counts 13, 14 and 15

are only against 3rd, 4th & 5th Accused respectively)

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge had acquitted the

6th Accused from all the counts and proceeded to convict the 1st-5th Accused

on Count Nos. 1-12. The learned High Court Judge had also convicted the

[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 6 of 13

6

3rd Accused on Count No. 13; the 4th Accused on Count No. 14; and the 5th

Accused on Count No. 15 respectively.

Although the learned High Court Judge had also convicted the 1st-5th Accused

on the remaining counts framed under Section 32 of the Penal Code (i.e., the

Count Nos. 08, 09, 10, 11, 12), he had not passed any sentence on the 1st-5th

Accused in respect of those counts.

Being aggrieved by the judgement dated 04-06-2007 pronounced by the High

Court, the 1st-5th Accused had appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of

Appeal after the argument by its judgment dated 25-03-2011, had decided to

acquit the 2nd, 3rd and 5th Accused from all counts framed against them.

However, the Court of Appeal had proceeded to affirm the conviction and

sentence imposed on the 1st and 4th Accused on counts 8-12 and the

conviction and the sentence imposed on the 4th Accused in respect of count

Nos. 1, 8-12 and 14. The Court of Appeal had proceeded to acquit the 4th

Accused from count Nos. 2-7.

The main complaint made by the learned Presidents Counsel who appeared

for the 4th Accused-Appellant-Appellant in this case is against the two

different decisions made by the Court of Appeal respectively in respect of the

3rd Accused and the 4th Accused. He pointed out to the evidence of witness

No. 01, Pattiyawattage Nimal Perera Samarasinghe who is the sole eye witness

in this case. The said witness is the only person who had identified the

Accused at the subsequently held identification parade. It is not disputed by

the learned Additional Solicitor General that the evidence against the 3rd and

4th Accused is similar. Wherever and whenever the prosecution witness No.

01 had narrated the incident pertaining to this case, what he had stated was

that he had identified both the 3rd and 4th Accused. He had always mentioned

the names of the 3rd and 4th Accused together. This is apparent from pages

116, 118, 129 and 130 of the Appeal Brief. It is appropriate to re-produce

those parts of his evidence in this regard.

Thus, it is not disputed and is indeed clear from the above portions of evidence

recorded in the trial that it is one and the same evidence that could be used

either to convict or acquit the 3rd and 4th Accused as far as the evidence in

relation to their facial identities are concerned.

According to the judgement dated 25-03-2011, the Court of Appeal has stated

as follows-:

The 3rd Accused was sentenced to death and rigorous

imprisonment ranging up to 15 years. The evidence against the 3rd

accused was his identification at a parade and joint representation

by Counsel. The 3rd accused is said to have worn a facemask

during the commission of the offences and the virtual complainant

claims to have identified him when the 3rd accused had

occasionally removed/lifted the mask. In any event his

identification alone by a single witness unaccompanied by other

evidence does not warrant a conviction on the charges as such

evidence is insufficient to convict him on the charges. For the

reasons, I am satisfied that the verdict against the 3rd Accused was

unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence, and that a

verdict of acquittal should be entered in his case. Hence, I feel

constrained to think that the convictions of the 3rd accused and

[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 9 of 13

9

sentences passed on him should be set aside and the 3rd accused

be acquitted on all the charges.

Therefore, it is clear that the Court of Appeal was not convinced that the

identity of the 3rd Accused was established to the satisfaction of Court through

the evidence of prosecution witness No. 01. It is on that basis that the Court

of Appeal had set-aside the conviction of the 3rd Accused and proceeded to

acquit him from all counts in the indictment.

The Court of Appeal as regards the 4th Accused had stated as follows-:

The case against the 4th accused mainly depended on the evidence

relating to the identification parade, dock identification and section

27 discovery of the firearms and an opinion expressed by a

ballistic expert regarding the use of the firearms in the commission

of the offences. The conviction of the 5th accused was based on

mere identification, at a parade followed by dock identification.

The Counsel for the 4th accused contended that the evidence

adduced against their clients is hardly sufficient to bring home a

conviction while the State argued the contrary.

Therefore, it appears that the Court of Appeal was satisfied about the identity

of the 4th Accused on the same evidence that it rejected as regards the 3rd

Accused, in the presence of evidence of a recovery of a revolver subsequent to

Section 27 statement made by the 4th Accused. It appears that the learned

Judges of the Court of Appeal had also taken in to consideration that joint

representation entered by a single counsel for the 3rd, 4th and 5th Accused and

the fact that counsel is a junior of the learned Presidents Counsel who had

appeared for the 1st Accused. This is apparent from the following extract taken

from the Court of Appeal judgement.

In the circumstances, it could safely be assumed that the 1st

accused has indirectly admitted the stand of the prosecution that

the 3rd, 4th and 5th accused were concerned with the commission

of the crime. In that frame of mind, it is difficult to understand as

[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 10 of 13

10

to the basis on which the 1st accused could have reposed

confidence in his Counsel who had also taken instructions to

defend the 3rd, 4th and 5th accused. This is a grave incriminating

circumstance that should have been taken into consideration as an

item of evidence against the 1st accused.

The joint representation entered by a single Counsel applies to the

3rd, 4th and 5th accused vice versa. In this background, the

prosecution has invited us to take notice of this unusual

arrangement made to represent the accused by one single Counsel,

as a relevant fact against them as well in determining their degree

of responsibility in the commission of the crimes. Considering the

extreme unusual conduct of the 1st accused and others, I am of the

opinion that it constitutes strong incriminating evidence falling into

the category of subsequent conduct of the accused.

I have stated that a Presidents Counsel had appeared for all the

accused in the High Court until 08.09.2005. It is thereafter that the

appearance had been marked separately for the 1st accused and

others. After this date until the conclusion of the trial, the same

Presidents Counsel continued to enter his appearance for the 1st

accused and quite surprisingly his junior in the case, ceased to be

his Junior Counsel and took over case of the other accused. This

clearly shows that the cure provided was even worse that the

disease. The conspiracy between the 1st accused and the others,

particularly the 4th accused is quite apparent from this

arrangement. This being relevant to the fact in issue, cannot be

ignored in determining the degree of culpability of the accused. As

this is borne out by the record of the Magistrate Court and High

Court none can say that it is not proved to the required standard.

We see no basis for such conclusion. Moreover, since this conclusion has been

categorically repeated in more than one place in the judgment, we have no

reason to reject the submission made by the learned Presidents Counsel for

the 4th Accused-Appellant-Appellant that this erroneous conclusion had

[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 11 of 13

11

influenced the mind of the Judges of the Court of Appeal. This factor appears

to have ultimately prompted them to arrive at a different conclusion in respect

of the 4th Accused which had resulted in a different treatment meted out to

the 4th Accused as against the 3rd Accused despite the fact that the evidence

against each one of them remains the same.

Let me now deal with the conclusion arrived at by the learned Judges of the

Court of Appeal about the presence of evidence of a recovery of a revolver

subsequent to Section 27 statement made by the 4th Accused. Admittedly,

the 4th Accused had surrendered with an Attorney-at-Law to the police station

at 9.00 pm, fifteen days after the incident. We also observe that the police

officer had recorded the statement from the 4th Accused at 9.15 pm, just

fifteen minutes after the time he had surrendered to Maharagama police

station. It is this statement which had contained the Section 27 statement

which is alleged to have led to the recovery of a revolver from a particular

place. Having regard to: the time at which the 4th Accused had surrendered

to the Police Station; the time at which his statement had been recorded; the

background of the evidence regarding the identity of the Accused coming from

a solitary witness who says at one point of time that the 4th Accused was

wearing a mask, it is highly questionable as to whether it is right for the Court

of Appeal to place that much of reliance on the Section 27 statement and the

subsequent recovery of a revolver to come to a conclusion that the identity of

the 4th Accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt. In any event,

as pointed out by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 4th Accused, even if

the evidence of a recovery of a revolver subsequent to Section 27 statement

made by the 4th Accused is accepted, it is clear that the effect of the Section

27 statement and the subsequent recovery is limited only to the inference

that the 4th Accused had knowledge of the particular revolver concealed or

placed at that particular location. That would be an independent item of

evidence. Moreover, although the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal in

their judgment at page 50, had stated that According to the evidence of the

government analysts P3 is a revolver and it is a gun within the meaning of the

law and the two bullets recovered from the body of the deceased may have

been fired from the said revolver. It is clear that this is also not a correct

conclusion.

[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 12 of 13

12

The relevant Government Analysts report dated 26-02-1990 was tendered to

this Court by the 4th Accused-Appellant-Appellant by way of motion dated 09-

09-2011. This has been produced in the High Court marked P9. What the

Government Analyst report has stated is as follows-:

We observe that me1 and me2 referred to in the Government Analysts report

are spent bullets. me3 is the revolver. Therefore, what the learned Judge of the

Court of Appeal has stated in his judgement does not appear to be a

conclusive opinion expressed by the Government Analyst. We observe that

this fact also has influenced the mind of the learned Judges of the Court of

Appeal to come to the conclusion that the identity of the 4th Accused-Appellant

has been established.

As the Court of Appeal has held that the evidence of witness No. 01 relating

to the identity of the 3rd Accused is not satisfactory, the Court of Appeal had

acquitted the 3rd Accused. Hon. Attorney General had not appealed against

that finding. Therefore, to date, the Court of Appeals conclusion on that

matter has survived. The question before us is whether there is any additional

material to affirm the conviction of the 4th Accused in view of the fact that it

was on the witness No. 01s evidence that the prosecution had sought to

establish the identity of the 4th Accused also. We are unable to see any such

additional material against the 4th Accused which is capable of independently

establishing the identity of the 4th Accused. Thus, we are compelled to take

the view that there is a clear disparity in the judgment pronounced by the

Court of Appeal which had opted to treat the 4th Accused in a way different to

that of the 3rd Accused.

[SC Appeal No. 60/2013] - Page 13 of 13

13

Going by the Court of Appeal conclusion with regard to the 3rd Accused we

are of the view that there had been no basis before the Court of Appeal to have

enabled it to arrive at a conclusion that the identity of the 4th Accused is

nevertheless established.

Although this Court has granted Special Leave to Appeal in respect of several

questions of law set out in paragraph 15 of the petition dated 06-05-2011 we

are of the view that it would suffice to provide an answer to the following

question of law which is set out in paragraph 15 (c) of the petition dated 06-

05-2011.

Did their Lordships err when they concluded that the Petitioner was

clearly identified while at the same time acquitting the 3rd and 5th

Accused whose convictions were also based on substantially the

same evidence?

We answer the above question of law in the affirmative. Therefore, we proceed

to set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed on the 4th Accused and

direct that the 4th Accused be acquitted and discharged from all counts in the

indictment.

Judgment of the High Court in so far as the 4th Accused is concerned, is set

aside. The judgement of the Court of Appeal in so far as the 4th Accused is

concerned, is set aside.

Registrar is directed to forward the copy of this judgement to the relevant High

Court as soon as the judgment is ready.

Appeal is allowed.
