"in establishing the prosecution’s case, which can be summarized as follows. In Sigera"
"vs Attorney General (2011 1 SLR page 201) the Court held that,"
"“In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the evidence"
"must be consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with"
"any other reasonable hypotheses of his innocence. In order to justify"
"an inference of guilt from the circumstantial evidence the inculpatory"
"facts  must  be  incompatible  with  the  innocence  of  the  accused  and"
"incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypotheses than"
"that of his guilt. (Vide. King Vs Abeywickrama, King Vs Appuhamy, as"
"held in Podisingho Vs King, that in the case of circumstantial evidence"
"it is the duty of the trial judge to tell the jury that such evidence must"
"be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and must only"
"be consistent with his guilt. In Don Sunny Vs Attorney General, it was"
"held that proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together"
"must  irresistibly  point  towards  the  only  inference  that  the  accused"
"committed the offence and that if an inference can be drawn which is"
"consistent  with  the  innocence  of  the  accused  the  accused  cannot  be"
"convicted.”"
