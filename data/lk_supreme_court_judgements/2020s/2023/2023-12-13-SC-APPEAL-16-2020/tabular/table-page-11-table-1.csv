"I am of the view that in the light of the above evidence by the JMO, the contention"
"raised  by  the  Appellant  to  the  effect  that  the  death  was  a  case  of  suicide  becomes"
"negatory.  Further,  the  contention  submitted  by  the  Appellant  to  the  effect  that  the"
"wounds were the result of a fall or an attempt to reverse the decision to commit suicide"
"also becomes nugatory on the above evidence. Furthermore, considering the number"
"of  wounds  on the  body  of  the deceased and  their  nature  as explained  by  the  JMO,"
"together with the evidence that shows the effect of a struggle, the deceased’s mouth"
"being covered, and a blow to the deceased’s head, the irresistible inference one can"
"draw is that this is a clear case of murder. As it was submitted in the evidence of the"
"JMO, the 15 cm mark found on the front-middle portion of the neck of the deceased,"
"which, in his opinion, is a mark created by an act subsequent to the death of the victim"
"or  a  post-mortem  injury,  supports  the  contention  that  the  Appellant  attempted  to"
"stage an act of suicide after committing the murder."
"In this case, as per page 349 of the appeal brief, it is very clearly indicated in the post-"
"mortem report that the signs of hypostasis  were visible on the posterior part of the"
"body. However, according to the evidence of PW1, upon her arrival, the body position"
"was face down on the floor."
