The Accused-Appellant-Appellant preferred this appeal against the judgment of the

Court of dated 17th February 2017 and the special leave was granted on 13th February

2020 on the questions of law set out in paragraphs 12(i), 12(iv) and 12(vii) of the

Petition dated 29th March 2017. On the argument day, the Counsel for the Appellant

and learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that they would confine their

submissions to questions of law no. (i) and (vii) of paragraph 12 of the Petition stated

as follows.

12(i) Did the learned Trial Judge err in law by failure to consider

that the items of circumstantial evidence placed before him were

not sufficient to prove the prosecutions case against the appellant

beyond reasonable doubt?

SC APPEAL 16/2020 JUDGEMENT Page 4 of 15

12 (vii) Did their Lordships of the Court of Appeal err in law in

holding that the Trial Judge was correct in disbelieving and

rejecting the dock statement in the light of the prosecution

evidence?

I find it pertinent to set out the material facts of the case prior to addressing the

question of law before us.

The Accused-Appellant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) to the

present appeal, Jayasinghe Mudiyanselage Roshan Bandaranayake, was indicted

before the High Court of Nuwara Eliya (hereinafter referred to as the High Court) by

the Honourable Attorney General on the charge of committing the murder of Wakwella

Liyana Arachchige Neela Malani Wakwella on or about 27th February 2005 an offence

punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

The said Appellant opted to be tried before the High Court without a jury. After the

conclusion of the prosecution case, the Appellant chose to make a dock statement and

closed his case. The learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant on the

indictment and sentenced him to death. Being dissatisfied with the said conviction and

sentence, the Appellant had preferred an appeal to the Court of Appeal and raised the

following grounds of appeal.

(i) The items of circumstantial evidence are not sufficient to prove the

prosecutions case against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

(ii) The rejection of dock statement is wrongful and the learned High Court

Judge has failed to correctly apply principles governing the evaluation

of a dock statement.

After the conclusion of the arguments, the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal

delivered the judgment on 17th February 2017, dismissing the Appeal and affirming the

conviction and sentence of the learned High Court Judge. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment of the Court of Appeal, the Appellant had preferred the present appeal

before the Supreme Court.

SC APPEAL 16/2020 JUDGEMENT Page 5 of 15

As per the submitted facts of the case, the deceased Neela Malani Wakwella was the

legally married wife of the Appellant, and according to the evidence of the mother of

the Appellant, Kumarihamy (PW2), who was called as a prosecution witness at the High

Court trial, the deceased and the Appellant lived in a house in close proximity to the

house of Kumarihamy. The Police had commenced the investigation into the sudden

death of the deceased Neela Malani Wakwella as a case of suicide by strangulation,

but later, her husband (the Appellant) was arrested as the suspect for committing

murder of the said deceased.

The entirety of the prosecutions case is based on circumstantial evidence placed

before the High Court; therefore, it is important to conduct a proper evaluation of the

said circumstantial evidence in order to address the first question of law submitted in

this present case. During the trial before the High Court, the prosecution had relied on

the evidence of the witnesses namely Godella Waththa Arachchilage Ranjith Dharmasiri

(PW 1), Jayasinghe Mudiyanselage Kumarihamy (PW 2), Weerasinghe Mudiyanselage

Podi Appuhamy (PW 6), Doctor Ashoka Bandara Senevirathne Consultant Judicial

Medical Officer Kandy (PW 16), Retired Inspector of Police Marabedde Rathnayake

Tiyunis Gunathilake (PW 9) and Widyarathne Ganithayalage Wasantha Kumari

Premaratne (PW 8).

According to the evidence of Kumarihamy (PW 2), who is the mother of the Appellant,

the deceased was living alone with the Appellant, on the day the incident occurred. As

narrated by PW 2, at around 8.30 pm on the day of the incident, the Appellant had

visited her on his way to the paddy field to borrow a torch from her. She further testified

that upon hearing the cries of the Appellant around 11.30 pm following his return from

the paddy field, she had hastily made her way to the Appellants house to inquire. At

this juncture, PW1 had seen a piece of wire hooked onto the beam of the house and

another piece of wire that encircled the deceaseds neck. She further testified that she

held the deceased by her legs, and when she attempted to bring her down, the wire

SC APPEAL 16/2020 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 15

from which the deceased was hanging was broken. During this time, the Appellant was

outside the house crying for help from the neighbours.

According to the evidence of witness Dharmasiri (PW 1- the Grama Seva Niladhari), he

had gone to the house of the deceased on the day in question around midnight on

information received from a neighbour. PW 1 found the Appellant seated on a mat

outside the house, and discovered the deceased collapsed near a chair, with one of her

legs still propped on the said chair. He also observed a piece of wire tied to the roof.

He was informed that the deceased had committed suicide by hanging herself. He then

had taken steps to the Police about the death by telephone.

The above descriptions of the scene were confirmed by the evidence of the Inspector

of Police Gunathilake, who was attached to Walapane Police Station. According to his

evidence, the information with regard to the suicide of Wakwella Liyana Arachchige

Neela Malani Wakwella was received by the police station around 2.40 A.M. from the

Grama Niladhari Dharmasiri, and he had gone to the scene of crime around 3.10 A.M.

with a team of police officers consisting of PC 40442, PC 15890, RPC 37718 and the

Inquirer into Sudden Deaths (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the ISP) of the

area. Whilst confirming the position of the dead body with the Grama Niladhari, this

witness had further observed a piece of wire near the body of the deceased in addition

to the wire hanging from the roof. This witness had further observed a wallet with

several letters kept on a cabinet closer to the body. Since the witness had observed

some significance with the said wallet, he had inspected it and found 27 well-packed

love letters written by one Kumari to the Appellant, Roshan Bandaranayake. He had

taken the said letters into his custody, and the said letters were identified at the trial

before the High Court. According to the witness, the wallet was empty save for the

letters.

Even though he had arrived at the scene with the ISP, he felt suspicious of the nature

of the wires and the letters found inside the wallet. Thereby, he requested the inquirer

to refer the matter to a Magisterial Inquiry.

SC APPEAL 16/2020 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 15

The prosecution had relied on the evidence of Wasantha Kumari Premarathne (PW 8)

to explain the 27 love letters found in close proximity to the dead body of the deceased.

According to the evidence of Wasantha Kumari, she had an affair with the Appellant,

Roshan Bandaranayake, in or about 2003 and admitted to writing letters to him. PW 8

had identified the letters produced before the court by the prosecution. However,

according to this witness, she was unaware of the fact that the Appellant was a married

person when she engaged in the affair. When the wife of the accused (the deceased in

this case) visited her along with her mother to confront the witness, on her fathers

advice PW 8 worshipped the deceased to apologise and express her regret, promising

to end the affair with the Appellant. According to the witness, since then, she has never

written or maintained any relationship with the Appellant, and the letters she received

from the Appellant were burnt by her.

As it was submitted, the most important evidence of the prosecution was the evidence

of the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer A.B. Seneviratne (PW 16), who held the post-

mortem inquiry of the deceased Neela Malani Wakwella. At the post-mortem, Dr.

Senevirathne stated that a total of 21 wounds were discovered on the body of the

deceased, and there were multiple abrasions on both sides of the neck of the deceased.

The Judicial Medical Officer (hereinafter referred to as the JMO), in giving evidence at

the trial, confirmed that the death was caused by manual strangulation.

Moreover, the JMO, giving evidence at the trial, refuted the contention that one of the

marks found across the neck of the deceased was a mark caused while the deceased

was alive.

Further, the JMO confirmed the possibility of the above-mentioned mark being caused

by the wire found at the place of the incident and marked as a production in Court.

Therefore, it is submitted that the wound no.10 found on the body (15cm horizontal

mark across the front middle of the neck) of the deceased supports the proposition

that the Appellant attempted to hang the body using the wire subsequent to the

commission of murder in order to stage it as a case of suicide. In addition, the JMO

giving evidence confirmed that there was evidence of a struggle, evidence of the

deceaseds mouth being covered shut, and evidence of a blow to the head.

I am of the view that in the light of the above evidence by the JMO, the contention

raised by the Appellant to the effect that the death was a case of suicide becomes

negatory. Further, the contention submitted by the Appellant to the effect that the

wounds were the result of a fall or an attempt to reverse the decision to commit suicide

also becomes nugatory on the above evidence. Furthermore, considering the number

of wounds on the body of the deceased and their nature as explained by the JMO,

together with the evidence that shows the effect of a struggle, the deceaseds mouth

being covered, and a blow to the deceaseds head, the irresistible inference one can

draw is that this is a clear case of murder. As it was submitted in the evidence of the

JMO, the 15 cm mark found on the front-middle portion of the neck of the deceased,

which, in his opinion, is a mark created by an act subsequent to the death of the victim

or a post-mortem injury, supports the contention that the Appellant attempted to

stage an act of suicide after committing the murder.

In this case, as per page 349 of the appeal brief, it is very clearly indicated in the post-

mortem report that the signs of hypostasis were visible on the posterior part of the

body. However, according to the evidence of PW1, upon her arrival, the body position

was face down on the floor.

: ?

: . .

As per the evidence of PW1, if the body was face down on the floor, it is impossible to

have evidence of hypostasis (post mortem lividity- is the result of sedimenting of the

blood in a cadaver due to gravity. It commences as soon as the circulation ceases. This

appears and apparent after 30-60 minutes after death) on the posterior part of the

body. Therefore, it is very clear from this evidence that the body was shifted after the

death occurred. It is also clear that the body was lying somewhere else face up for a

considerable period of time before it was shifted to the position in which it was found.

SC APPEAL 16/2020 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 15

As it was discussed above, the prosecution heavily relied on the circumstantial evidence

in establishing the prosecutions case, which can be summarized as follows. In Sigera

vs Attorney General (2011 1 SLR page 201) the Court held that,

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the evidence

must be consistent with the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with

any other reasonable hypotheses of his innocence. In order to justify

an inference of guilt from the circumstantial evidence the inculpatory

facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and

incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypotheses than

that of his guilt. (Vide. King Vs Abeywickrama, King Vs Appuhamy, as

held in Podisingho Vs King, that in the case of circumstantial evidence

it is the duty of the trial judge to tell the jury that such evidence must

be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and must only

be consistent with his guilt. In Don Sunny Vs Attorney General, it was

held that proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together

must irresistibly point towards the only inference that the accused

committed the offence and that if an inference can be drawn which is

consistent with the innocence of the accused the accused cannot be

convicted.

In this case, based on the evidence of the JMO, the following was established: the cause

of death was due to manual strangulation and not suicide; the external injuries found

on the body were compatible with injuries inflicted when resisting manual

strangulation; there were no internal injuries found corresponding to the mark found

on the neck; and that it was a post-mortem injury. Even though the scene of the crime

was arranged to display that the deceased had a fall after she hanged herself, the

injuries on her body were not compatible with a fall but instead with resistance to

manual strangulation, and the scene of the crime did not match a version of events

where the deceased fell after hanging herself due to the fact that her leg was still

SC APPEAL 16/2020 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 15

propped on a chair. According to the evidence of Kumarihamy (the mother of the

Appellant) only the Appellant and the deceased lived in their house. The 27 letters

inside the wallet found in close proximity to the body of the deceased were

undisturbed and well-packed when recovered by the Police. The recovered letters

referred to an affair between the Appellant and witness Kumari, which, according to

PW 8, ended two years ago, and consequently, there is no purpose for the appearance

of these letters on the scene of a crime unless the person who placed them at the scene

of crime wanted to introduce them in order to mislead the investigation.

For the reasons set out above, we see no merit in the first ground of appeal raised by

the learned Counsel for the Appellant.

As the final ground of appeal, it was argued by the learned Counsel for the Appellant

that the rejection of the dock statement is wrongful and the learned High Court Judge

has failed to correctly apply principles governing the evaluation of a dock statement.

As discussed above, the Appellant, when explained his rights at the conclusion of the

prosecution case, opted to make a dock statement. In his dock statement, the Appellant

took up the position that when he returned home from the paddy field at around 11.30

P.M., he found the deceased collapsed near a small chair. He speaks of making an

attempt to lift her and, at that time, observed a rope around her neck. At that stage,

having been frightened, he called for his mother. No other evidence was placed on

behalf of the Appellant before the High Court, and the defences case was limited to

the dock statement.

It is appropriate at this stage to consider the approach adopted by the learned High

Court Judge in light of Supreme Court's decisions. In Queen V. Kularatne 71 NLR 529

at page 531, it was held that: -

When an unsworn statement is made by the accused from the dock,

the jurors must be informed that such statement must be looked upon

as evidence, subject however to the infirmity that the accused had

SC APPEAL 16/2020 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 15

deliberately refrained from giving sworn testimony. But the jury must

also be directed that

(a) if they believe the unsworn statement it must be acted upon,

(b) if it raises a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case for the

prosecution, the defence must succeed, and

(c) that it should not be used against another accused.

As observed by me, the learned High Court Judge was mindful of the medical evidence

led at the trial and appropriately gave due consideration to the dock statement in his

judgment (at pages 14-17) before rejecting it. In view of the above, it is abundantly

clear that the learned High Court Judge had adopted the correct approach in

evaluating the dock statement. Therefore, I see no merit in this argument.

Further, same and identical questions of law were raised in his appeal by the Appellant

before the Court of Appeal too. The learned Judges of the Court of Appeal dismissed

the Appellants appeal on 17th February 2017. I perused the judgment of the Court of

Appeal and I am of the view that the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal

comprehensively analysed both grounds of appeal, submissions made by the parties

and had come to a correct conclusion by dismissing the Appellants appeal.

Decision

After careful consideration of the submissions made, facts and circumstances of the

instant case as discussed above, there is no basis to interfere with the decision of the

learned High Court Judge of Nuwara Eliya and the learned Judges of the Court of

Appeal. I hereby dismiss this Appeal, by answering the first and second questions of

law negatively. I affirm the conviction and the sentence given by the learned High

SC APPEAL 16/2020 JUDGEMENT Page 15 of 15

Court Judge of Nuwara Eliya dated 02nd November 2010 and the judgment of the

learned of the Court of Appeal dated 17th February 2017.
