"It is the Appellant’s contention that the summons has not been served properly by the"
"Fiscal. However, as per Section 60 (2) above, it is seen that if personal service has not"
"been  successful,  then  the  Fiscal  has  the  authority  to  fix  the  summons  to  some"
"conspicuous part of the house in which the defendant ordinarily resides in, which is"
"known as substituted service of summons. As evidenced by the Journal Entry No. 14"
"dated 06th September 2010, the summons was pasted on the door of the address given"
"on the Lease Agreement, completing the substituted service of summons."
"The  summons  and  judgements  have  been  served  on  the  address  mentioned  in  the"
"lease  agreement,  and  later  at  the  second  address.  The  1st  Defendant  has  not  been"
"present at any of the two addresses on the dates that the summons were served by"
"the summons server. As proved by the journal entries and the fiscal reports mentioned"
"above, it is safe to assume that the Defendant is within the country, although he has"
"moved from place to place constantly."
