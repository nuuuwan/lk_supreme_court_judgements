S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The 1st Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant, namely Mohomed Thawbeer Mohomed

Haneez, (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) preferred this appeal

against the order of the Commercial High Court dated 10th March 2015.

The Appellant had filed his Petition of appeal on 8th May 2015 and submitted as

follows:

7) Being aggrieved by the said Order of the Honourable High Court Judge

of Commercial High Court of Colombo dated 10-03-2015 the 01st

Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant humbly makes this appeal against the

SC CHC Appeal 25/2015 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 17

said Order to Your Lordships Court on the following among other grounds

that may be urged by his counsel at the hearing of this appeal.

a. The said order is contrary to Law and against the weight of facts and

circumstances in this case.

b. The Honourable High Court Judge has failed to consider the real Issues

placed by the Appellant

c. The Honourable High Court Judge has failed to consider the fact that

the Respondent has failed to prove that the summons have been

properly served only Appellant by the Fiscal.

d. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the legal

entitlement of the Respondent and his order is totally contrary to the

doctrine of undue enrichment.

(Reproduced as it is) [sic]

This Court observes that there is no specific pleading of Questions of Law hence the

Court inquired for the Counsel to submit his questions of law. After submissions, the

Counsel submitted that he will be continuing his argument on paragraph 7(c) of the

Petition and moves to accept the same as questions of law and grounds of application.

The Counsel stated that he is not relying on (a), (b) and (d) of paragraph 7 as they are

wide and uncertain. Accordingly, the Court will be considering the following question

of law:

c. The Honourable High Court Judge has failed to consider the fact that

the Respondent has failed to prove that the summons have been properly

served only Appellant by the Fiscal.

(Reproduced as it is) [sic]

This Court reluctantly observes and places on record that none of the Parties have filed

written submissions. This was brought to the notice of both Counsel and they pleaded

SC CHC Appeal 25/2015 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 17

that they be permitted to make submissions and the written submissions will be filed

within two weeks, i.e. 20th July 2023. Unfortunately, up until 28th August 2023, neither

party has filed the written submissions. The Counsel for the 1st Defendant-Petitioner-

Appellant only filed his written submissions on 1st September 2023, more than a month

after the written submissions were due to be filed. This Court is compelled to rely on

their oral submissions and the materials available in the appeal brief.

To have a better understanding it will be preferable to have the facts of the case.

The Facts

1st Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant had obtained leasing facilities via Leasing

agreement bearing No. V/0885/24/NUW dated 24th May 2006 from Plaintiff-

Respondent-Respondent Company (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Plaintiff) to lease a Mitsubishi FE516BD Motor Lorry. In the said leasing agreement

(P2), the 1st Defendant was to pay sixty monthly instalments of Rs. 61,056.74 to the

Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent. Two guarantors Arpin Mohomed Hameen (2nd

Defendant) and Wahampurage Rukman Samaranayake (3rd Defendant) entered into

Guarantee Agreement with the Plaintiff Company dated 24th May 2006 and guaranteed

inter alia that the 1st Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant would make punctual payment

of all rentals and all sums due and owing to the Plaintiff in terms of the said Lease

Agreement.

The Appellant failed to pay the monthly Lease Rentals as stated in the agreement. The

Plaintiff therefore issued Notice of Failure. As the 1st Defendant failed to remedy the

substantial failure, the Plaintiff set out to terminate the Lease Agreement by letter

dated 20th March 2007. Letters of demand were sent to 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants to

pay the sum of Rs. 3,088,679.28 which was owed to the Plaintiff. Since there was no

response, the Plaintiff Company filed an action at the Commercial High Court to

recover the due amount. Summons were served on 3rd Defendant. He had appeared

and filed his proxy and answer on or about 11th October 2009. It was reported that the

SC CHC Appeal 25/2015 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 17

2nd Defendant has died during the pendency of the case in the Commercial High Court

of Colombo.

Plaintiff Company claims that they have sent notices via Registered post and since

there is no response, they have served notice through the Fiscal.

In the fiscal report dated 30th July 2009, the person who served summons affirmed and

stated that

M. 2009 07 21 1, 2

,

The unofficial translation of the above is given below for ease of reference.

"I, summons server, M. Selvam, inform the Honourable Court that on 21st

July 2009, I went to his house at Magasthota, Mipilimana where the 1st

and 2nd Defendants usually reside, and I am being informed that the 1st

Defendant is residing in Welimada area and the 2nd Defendant is now

deceased. "

On the application made by the Plaintiff Company the Court ordered to serve the

summons through substituted service, the same was effected by the fiscal on the given

address i.e. No. 42/12, Gajabapura, Magastota, Nuwara Eliya.

The Fiscal of Nuwara Eliya reported with an affidavit stating that the notice was pasted

on the doors of the given address and substituted service was duly complied with.

Thereafter it was informed to Court that he is living elsewhere, namely, No. 142,

Himiliyagahamadiththa, Uwaparanagama.

Once again, the notice was sent to the new address but the 1st Defendant-Petitioner-

Appellant was not available and evading of receiving the notice. Once again it was

served through substituted service and a report was filed in the Court.

On the same report it was written that he went to the given new address to find the

1st Defendant in this case, (for 3 days), but then came to know that this Defendant is

not available, absconding and evading the service of notice. Therefore, he reported to

the Court that the summons cannot be served.

SC CHC Appeal 25/2015 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 17

On 9th October 2013 the Plaintiff Company changed its name, and this was informed

to the lawyers of the 1st and 3rd Defendants via registered post.

The Commercial High Court of Western Province being convinced of the service of

summons, heard the case ex parte against the 1st Defendant and ordered in favour of

the Company (Plaintiff-Respondent) on 16th December 2011.

When the company tried to proceed against the 3rd Defendant, the 1st Defendant-

Petitioner-Appellant made an application under Section 86 (2) of the Civil Procedure

Code to vacate the order. Section 86 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code has been

reproduced below.

Where, within fourteen days of the service of the decree entered against

him for default, the defendant with notice to the plaintiff makes

application to and thereafter satisfies court, that he had reasonable

grounds for such default, the court shall set aside the judgment and decree

and permit the defendant to proceed with his defence as from the stage of

default upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as to the court shall

appear proper.

The Commercial High Court after hearing both sides, dismissed the application to

vacate the ex parte order. Being aggrieved with the order of the Commercial High

Court, 1st Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant preferred an appeal to this Court.

Analysis

It is to be noted that the written submissions, motions and petitions submitted by the

parties have variations with regard to the names of the parties. Therefore, we will be

referring to the Petition filed in this Court regarding the same.

The main issue raised by the Appellant is that the Commercial High Court Judge has

failed to consider the fact that the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent Company has

SC CHC Appeal 25/2015 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 17

failed to prove that the summons have been properly served on the Appellant by the

Fiscal.

In Wimalawathie and Others vs Thotamuna and Others (1998) 3 Sri LR 1, Dr.

Ranaraja, J held that

The affidavit filed by the Process Server is prima facie evidence of

the fact that summons was duly served on the defendants mentioned

therein and there is a presumption that summons was duly served.

Accordingly, the burden shifts on to the defendants to prove that no

summons had been served.

(Emphasis added)

As affidavits have been filed by the process/summons servers, the 1st Defendant must

present evidence to prove that no summons had been served, however, there has been

no satisfactory evidence to prove the stance of the 1st Defendant. He keeps insisting

that the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent Company has to prove the summons were

served on him, although vide Dr. Ranaraja, Js judgement in the above mentioned case,

once an affidavit has been signed, the burden of proof shifts to the 1st Defendant.

I discussed earlier that the Appellant was evading notice and not residing in the

address stated on the Lease Agreement. As seen in the Commercial High Court Journal

Entry No.10B, the Fiscal has got to know that the Appellant was hiding/evading from

receiving summons. Journal Entry No. 14 dated 06th September 2010 states that the

summons was pasted on the door of the previous address given on the Lease

Agreement.

Now I draw my attention to the above mentioned lease agreement bearing No.

V/0885/24/NUW dated 24th May 2006.

The address given by the Appellant was No. 42/12 Gajabapura, Magastota, Nuwara

Eliya. If a party changes their address, it is mandatory for them to inform the other side

SC CHC Appeal 25/2015 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 17

of their change of address. But if the party has a reasonable explanation for not doing

so within a reasonable time, it can be considered according to the situation

subjectively. In the given matter, the summons server got to know that the 1st

Defendant was not residing in the address given in the lease agreement only after he

went to serve summons on separate days. Even after the summons were served on the

second address, the 1st Defendant was not present at the second address either. It was

the 1st Defendants father who informed the summons server that his son (the 1st

Defendant) was residing in Colombo at the time. It must be highlighted that none of

these address changes were informed to the Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent

Company at any point. The 1st Defendant has moved around the country but has not

informed the Plaintiffs of his changes in addresses even at one instance. This is a clear

evasion of receiving summons.

Further, I draw my attention to Article 30 of the lease agreement above mentioned

which provides for service of notice. It says as follows:

Article 30: Service of Notice

Any notice summons or demand to be sent or given by either party or their

duly authorised representative or their Attorneys-At-Law or by any Court

or any Tribunal or any Arbitrator/s to the other may be sent by

registered post to the address of the other party as appearing herein

or such other address as such party may from time to time have duly

communicated to the other and if so sent shall be deemed to be served

on the day following the date of posting. In proving service of any

notice, summons, demand or Arbitral award it shall be sufficient to show

that the letter containing the notice, summons, demand or Arbitral

Award was properly addressed, stamped and posted under

registered cover, or has been served to the address of the other party

SC CHC Appeal 25/2015 JUDGEMENT Page 15 of 17

as appearing herein or such other address as such party may have from

time to time duly communicated to the other party.

It is hereby agreed by and between the parties hereto that a notice,

summons, demand or Arbitral Award so sent and/or served in terms of the

foregoing by one party is deemed to have been received by the other party

and no objection on grounds of non-receipt of notice can be taken by the

party to where such notice, summons, demand or Arbitral Award was sent.

(Emphasis added)

It is clear that there is a contractual obligation between these two parties regarding

service of notice. If a notice is sent to the given address, as per the above provisions

of the contract, it will be sufficient.

In the present case however, the company had not only served notices to the given

address through registered post but also served notices via Fiscal and substituted

service. It had also informed the Defendants of change in the name of the Company.

The Company and the fiscals have gone above and beyond their duty to serve the

summons on the 1st Defendant. He therefore cannot rely on his evasion to claim that

he did not receive summons and claim that the Learned Commercial High Court Judge

erred in his judgement.

Section 60 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

(1) The court shall, where it is reported that summons could not be

effected by registered post or where the summons having been

served and the defendant fails to appear, direct that such summons

be served personally on the defendant by delivering or tendering to

him the said summons through the Fiscal or the Grama Niladhari

within whose division the defendant resides or in any case where the

plaintiff is a lending institution within the meaning of the Debt Recovery

SC CHC Appeal 25/2015 JUDGEMENT Page 16 of 17

(Special Provisions) Act, No. 2 of 1990, through the Fiscal or other officer

authorized by court, accompanied by a precept in form No. 17 of the First

Schedule. In the case of a corporation summons may be served personally

by delivering or tendering it to the secretary or like officer or a director or

the person in charge of the principal place of business of such corporation.

(2) If the service referred to in the preceding provisions of this section

cannot by the exercise of due diligence be effected, the Fiscal or

Grama Niladhari shall affix the summons to some conspicuous part

of the house in which the defendant ordinarily resides or in the case

of a corporation or unincorporated body, to the usual place of business or

office of such corporation or such body and in every such case the summon

shall be deemed to have been duly served on the defendant.

(Emphasis added)

It is the Appellants contention that the summons has not been served properly by the

Fiscal. However, as per Section 60 (2) above, it is seen that if personal service has not

been successful, then the Fiscal has the authority to fix the summons to some

conspicuous part of the house in which the defendant ordinarily resides in, which is

known as substituted service of summons. As evidenced by the Journal Entry No. 14

dated 06th September 2010, the summons was pasted on the door of the address given

on the Lease Agreement, completing the substituted service of summons.

The summons and judgements have been served on the address mentioned in the

lease agreement, and later at the second address. The 1st Defendant has not been

present at any of the two addresses on the dates that the summons were served by

the summons server. As proved by the journal entries and the fiscal reports mentioned

above, it is safe to assume that the Defendant is within the country, although he has

moved from place to place constantly.

Decision

Considering all above material before us, I turn to answer the question of law

considered by this Court, as to whether the High Court Judge has failed to prove that

summons have been properly served on the Appellant by the Fiscal. I answer in the

negative and find that the learned High Court judge has not failed to consider the fact

that the summons have been properly served on the Appellant by the Fiscal.

I state that the learned High Court Judge has made the correct order. There is no

reason for us to interfere with said order. Accordingly, I dismiss this appeal with cost.

Appeal Dismissed with cost.
