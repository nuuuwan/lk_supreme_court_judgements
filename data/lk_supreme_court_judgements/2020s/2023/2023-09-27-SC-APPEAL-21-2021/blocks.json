It is noted thateven though the accused made a statement from the dock he was silent as to whathappened after the deceased was placed on the bed. I am of the view that thestatement of the accused that he did not know anything about the incident cannotbe accepted. An accused person is entitled to remain silent but when theprosecution has established strong and incriminating evidence against him he isrequired to offer an explanation of the highly incriminating circumstancesestablished against him. Accordingly, the court tends to apply Ellenboroughdictum in such situations.",
