"In
the
case
of Kotuwila Kankanamalage
Premalal
Leonard
Perera
v"
"Attorney General [SC/Appeal/220/2014] decided on 09.11.2018 at page 05 the"
"Supreme Court observed that “It
is evident
that a Magistrate will only act on the"
"evidence of a witness
if
the witness
is a credible witness and the credibility is"
"tested mainly on the demeanor or deportment of a witness after applying several"
"tests
such
as probability/
improbability,
spontaneity, belatedness,
consistency/"
"inconsistency, and/or
interestedness/ disinterestedness/”.
It
is apparent
that
the"
"Learned High Court
Judge and the Honourable Judges of
the Court of Appeal"
"have carefully analysed, evaluated, and weighed the evidence that was led in the"
"trial and was convinced that
the testimonies of these two witnesses in Court were"
"cogent and truthful in nature."
"I
am of
the
view that
the
prosecution
has
established
a
strong
case with"
"incriminating and cogent evidence against
the Accused Appellants. Under these"
"circumstances
the evidence of
the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant
(the dock"
"statement denying any and all
involvement
in the incident) had failed to create"
"any reasonable doubt in the prosecution case."
"Now I will proceed to address
the second question of
law namely that “This"
"being a case based on circumstantial evidence, the Learned High Court Judge and"
"the Hon. Judges of the Court of Appeal failed to properly consider and correctly"
"apply the
relevant principles
applicable
to such a case in order
to arrive at a"
"decision in the said case”."
"The
rule
regarding circumstantial
evidence
and its
effect, has been stated by"
"Chief Justice Shaw in the American Case of Commonwealth v Webster [1850]"
"5 Cush. 295, 59 Mass. 295 the following words which have been referred to in"
"Seetin v The Queen [1965] 68 NLR 316 at 322.
“Where probable proof
is"
"brought of a statement of
facts tending to criminate the accused,
the absence of"
"evidence tending to a contrary conclusion is to be considered though not alone"
"entitled to much weight, because the burden of proof
lies on the accuser to make"
"out
the whole case by substantive evidence. But when pretty stringent proof of"
"circumstances is produced tending to support
the charge, and it
is apparent
that"
"the
accused
is
so
situated
that
he
could
offer
evidence
of all
the
facts and"
"circumstances as they exist, and show,
if such was the truth,
that
the suspicious"
"circumstances can be accounted for consistently with his innocence and he fails"
"to offer such proof,
the natural conclusion is that
the proof,
if produced,
instead"
"of rebutting, would tend to sustain the charge”"
