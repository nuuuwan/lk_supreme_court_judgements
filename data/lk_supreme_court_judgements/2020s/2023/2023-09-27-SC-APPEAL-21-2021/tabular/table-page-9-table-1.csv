"husband. PW9 in his
testimony stated that based on information received by"
"informants he became suspicious of
the 1st Accused Appellant Respondent and"
"decided to search her property. After which he observed a toilet pit covered with"
"wooden planks and fertiliser bags stacked on top of it situated within the property"
"belonging
to
the
1st Accused Appellant Respondent. The witness
stated
he"
"became suspicious upon such observation and recorded a statement from the 1st"
"Accused Appellant Respondent
and
based on her
statement,
the body of
the"
"deceased was
recovered. However,
the Honourable
Justices
of
the Court
of"
"Appeal correctly observed that,
the part of the statement that led to the discovery"
"of the body is dated 05.04.1999 marked පැ 1, which is almost one month prior to"
"the date the investigation had been initiated as stated by PW9 in his testimony"
"before court. The testimony of PW9 reflects the correct date of discovery of the"
"body which he
stated to be 03.05.1999.
The
true
copy of
the extract of
the"
"Information Book of Ruwanwella Police is dated 05.04.1999 which could be a"
"typing error.
However, I agree with the reasoning of the Learned Justices of the"
"Court of Appeal
for not acting upon the section 27 statement of
the Evidence"
"Ordinance
(This
could have been clarified by the Learned High Court
Judge"
"during the trial stage)."
"Thus,
the main evidence that remains is the evidence led against the two Accused"
"are the statements made by the Witnesses PW1 and PW2. Justice Jayasuriya in"
"Sumansena V Attorney General [1999] 3 Sri L.R. at 137 observed that “In our"
"law of evidence the salutary principle is enunciated that evidence must not be"
"counted but weighed and the evidence of a single solitary witness if cogent and"
"impressive could be acted upon by a court of
law. Section 134 of
the Evidence"
"Ordinance sets out
that no particular number of witnesses shall,
in any case, be"
"required for the proof of any fact”. Their Lordships in the above judgement are"
"of the view that a person may be convicted even on the evidence of one witness."
"In the case of the Attorney General V. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa [2011]"
"2 Sri LR 292 Supreme Court held; “Credibility is a question of fact and not law."
"Appellate
Judges
have
repeatedly
stressed
the
importance
of
Trial
Judges’"
"observation of the demeanor of witnesses in deciding questions of fact. Demeanor"
"represents
the
Trial
Judges’
opportunity
to
observe
the
witness
and
his"
"deportment.” The Learned High Court Judge in her
judgement states that she is"
"convinced of the truthful nature of the witness’s testimony of PW1, by observing"
"the demeanor of and deportment of the witness despite being subjected to a long"
"and protracted cross-examination."
