"(iii) The circumstances should be conclusive;"
"(iv) They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved."
"(v) There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable"
"ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of
the accused and must"
"show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.”"
"I am of
the view that
these conditions are fulfilled in the present case which is"
"solely dependent on circumstantial evidence. The Prosecution has proved its case"
"according to the
aforesaid measurements which are used on a
case based on"
"circumstantial evidence. When considering the cumulative effect of the evidence"
"led in the present case,
such as;
the witness PW1’s
testimony of how the 2nd"
"Accused Appellant Appellant
and the 1st Accused Appellant Respondent had"
"disposed
of
the
body
of
the
deceased which indicates
that
the 2nd Accused"
"Appellant Appellant
played
a
participatory
role, PW2 witnessed
her mother"
"removing some earth with some red powder-like substance from the footpath and"
"the testimony of
the PW14 where he discovered a stone with human-like hair"
"attached to it are all strands of evidence when considered together are sufficient"
"to ascertain guilt on part of the both the Accused as all of these actions amount to"
"the concealment of the crime that they are accused of committing."
"Now I will proceed to answer the third question of law, namely that “The Learned"
"High Court Judge and the Hon. Judges of the Court of Appeal failed to evaluate"
"the
evidence led against each accused in this case,
separately,
in arriving at a"
"decision against each such accused.”"
"In
terms
of
evidence
led
against
each
accused,
the
evidence
that
is most"
"significant
is the testimony of Thilakarathna PW1. The evidence given by PW2"
"the 1st Accused Appellant Respondents daughter corroborates certain aspects of"
"the
testimony
provided
by
Thilakarathna.
Further
based
on
the
statement"
"provided by the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant
to the investigating Police"
"Officer
(PW14)
a
stone had been discovered with hair
similar
to human hair"
"attached to it, however, no expert evidence regarding this
stone uncovered by"
"such statement had been led in the trial. Therefore,
the relevancy of its contents"
"cannot be given any evidentiary value."
"Thus, as reiterated above the main evidence against each accused is the testimony"
"of
the
two witnesses PW1
and PW2.
It
can be
contended however
that
the"
"testimony provided by PW2 does not
imply guilt on part of
the 2nd Accused"
