"Accused Appellant Appellant voluntarily participated in the disposal of the dead"
"body of the deceased and played a participatory role as it
is most unlikely for an"
"innocent person to partake in the disposal of a dead body to which he has no"
"connection whatsoever. Accordingly,
the only conclusion that could be arrived at"
"on such evidence is
that
the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant
is guilty of
the"
"offence charged."
"Therefore, considering all of the above factors in this appeal of the 2nd Accused"
"Appellant Appellant, I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge and the"
"Honourable Judges of
the Court of Appeal had arrived at a correct conclusion"
"that
the
prosecution
had
proved
the
case
against
the
1st Accused Appellant"
"Respondent
and
the
2nd Accused Appellant Appellant
beyond
a
reasonable"
"doubt."
"Accordingly, I answer the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd questions of law on which special leave"
"to appeal has been granted in the negative. For these reasons, the Judgment of the"
"Court of Appeal and that of the High Court of Kegalle are affirmed. The Appeal"
"of the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant is hereby dismissed."
