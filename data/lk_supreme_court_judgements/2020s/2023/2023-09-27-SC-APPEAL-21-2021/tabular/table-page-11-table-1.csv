"This view has been reiterated in the case of King vs. Abeywickrama [1943] 44"
"NLR 254 where it was held that “In order to base a conviction on circumstantial"
"evidence the Jury must be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the"
"accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of his innocence”."
"Based on the evaluation of the evidence,
the prosecution case hinges entirely on"
"the testimony of Thilkaratne (PW1) in which he stated that he witnessed the 2nd"
"Accused Appellant Appellant followed by the 1st Accused Appellant Respondent"
"dispose of the body of the deceased into the toilet pit."
"In the case of Bhojraj v Sita Ram [1935] AIR, 193 PC 60 at 62 Lord Roche set"
"out
the real
test
for accepting and rejecting a testimony of a witness based on"
"testimonial
trustworthiness
stating that “How consistent
is
the story with itself"
"(consistency per se). How does it stand the test of cross-examination? (Stability"
"under cross-examination) How far it
fits in with the rest of
the evidence and the"
"circumstances of
the case (inconsistency inter
se).” It
is important
to note that"
"PW1 has maintained the same position in his testimony throughout the trial."
"In order to convict an Accused person on the basis of circumstantial evidence it is"
"the duty of
the court
to be satisfied that
the facts proved are consistent with the"
"guilt of the accused and that the facts proved exclude every other possibility other"
"than
the
guilt of
the
accused.
In the
case of Gunawardena v the Republic"
"[1981] 2 SLR 315 CA it was held that “Each piece of circumstantial evidence is"
"not a link in a chain for if one link breaks the chain would fail. Circumstantial"
"evidence is more like a rope composed of several cords. One strand of rope may"
"be
insufficient
to sustain the weight but
three stranded together may be quite"
"sufficient.”"
"In the case of Hanumant vs State of M.P [1952] AIR SC 343; 1953 Cri LJ 129"
"have laid down the following conditions which must be fulfilled before a case"
"against
an
accused
based
on circumstantial
evidence
can be
said to be
fully"
"established;"
"“(i) The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt
is to be drawn should"
"be fully established. The circumstances concerned must or should and not may be"
"established;"
"(ii) The facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of
the"
"guilt of
the accused,
that
is to say,
that should not be explainable on any other"
"hypothesis except that the accused is guilty;"
