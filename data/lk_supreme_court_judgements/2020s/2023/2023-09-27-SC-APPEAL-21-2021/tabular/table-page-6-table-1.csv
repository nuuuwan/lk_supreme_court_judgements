"conclusion that can be arrived by court
is that both of them have committed the"
"murder of the deceased."
"Being aggrieved by the judgement of the High Court,
the 1st Accused Appellant"
"Respondent and the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant had appealed to the Court"
"of Appeal complaining inter alia that
the Learned High Court Judge misdirected"
"herself when admitting the evidence under section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance,"
"the evaluation of
the evidence given by PW1 is bad in law,
the Learned High"
"Court Judge misdirected herself by anticipating a reasonable explanation from the"
"said Appellant when the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case"
"against
the 1st Accused Appellant Respondent,
the Learned High Court Judge"
"failed to evaluate the medical evidence against the sole eye witness testimony and"
"the Learned High Court
Judge has not properly considered and evaluated the"
"evidence against the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant."
"The Honourable
Judges of
the Court of Appeal upon perusal of
the evidence"
"concluded that on the 1st ground of appeal
that
the evidence under section 27 of"
"the Evidence Ordinance
is unsafe to act upon. The Honourable Judges of
the"
"Court of Appeal thereafter considered the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th grounds of appeal"
"together as it was all
in relation to the credibility of evidence given by witness"
"(PW1). The Honourable Judges of the Court of Appeal observed that the Learned"
"High Court Judge had placed a heavy reliance on the evidence provided by PW1"
"to hold the 1st Accused Appellant Respondent and the 2nd Accused Appellant"
"Appellant guilty. PW1 was initially a suspect
in this case however, no evidence"
"was provided on the circumstances that led to his arrest. The Learned Counsel for"
"the Appellants questioned the belatedness of the statements given to the police by"
"PW1. The Honourable Judges of
the Court of Appeal observed that not a single"
"question had been put forth towards the witness for the belatedness of making the"
"said statement. The witness, however,
in his evidence had offered an explanation"
"as to why he could not make a statement to the Police soon after the incident had"
"taken
place,
as
the
1st Accused Appellant Respondent
and
the
2nd Accused"
"Appellant Appellant had repeatedly threatened him and asked him to refrain from"
"giving any information about
the incident. Further, PW1 had seen both the 1st"
"Accused Appellant Respondent and the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant at
the"
"crime scene at or about
the time the crime was committed, he observed that
the"
"dead body was held by the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant who was closely"
"followed by the 1st Accused Appellant Respondent and dumped into the toilet"
"pit.
