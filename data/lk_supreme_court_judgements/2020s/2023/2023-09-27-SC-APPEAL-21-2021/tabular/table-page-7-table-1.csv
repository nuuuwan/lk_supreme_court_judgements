"cross-examination and the Honourable Judges of
the Court of Appeal observed"
"that there was no motive on part of PW1 to implicate the Appellants in this crime."
"The Honourable Judges of
the Court of Appeal upon evaluation of the evidence"
"concluded that
there was no inconsistency in the lack of credibility with regard to"
"the evidence given by PW1 and that the Learned High Court Judge was correct in"
"accepting
the
said
evidence. The Honourable
Judges of
the Court of Appeal"
"upheld the conviction and sentence of the Learned High Court Judge, dismissing"
"the appeal."
"Being
aggrieved
by

decision
of

"from the aforementioned judgement of the Court of Appeal."
"The Learned Counsel
for
the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant submitted that"
"there were
no
eyewitnesses
to
this
case
and
it was
purely
based
on
the"
"circumstantial evidence. The witness PW1 had been arrested by the police as a"
"suspect, however later on named as a witness of the prosecution. 4 contradictions"
"had been marked on behalf of the Appellant during the cross-examination of the"
"witness of PW1 but
the Learned Trial Judge has failed to properly evaluate those"
"contradictions. The Learned Counsel further submitted that even though evidence"
"has been led by the Prosecution that several productions were recovered on the"
"statement of the appellant, but failed to mark the said production in the course of"
"the
trial. No Government Analysis Reports were marked. Only a
section 27"
"statement under the Evidence Ordinance has been marked in evidence against the"
"Appellant without even the productions being produced."
"The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant submitted that the"
"only evidence available against
the appellant
is that he assisted in the disposal of"

"had been recovered on a Section 27 statement however
the stone or strands of"
"hair had not been produced in court and there was no expert evidence placed"
"before
the
court
that
the
said
strands
recovered
by the Police. The Learned"
"Counsel
for
the
2nd Accused Appellant Appellant
further
submitted that
the"
"daughter of the 1st Accused Appellant Respondent, witness PW2 (K. V. Tharusha"
"Chathurika
Kithsiri)
commenced
giving
evidence
on
25.11.2013,
at
the"
"conclusion of the proceedings she had been released on Rs.10,000/- bail and that"
"this amounts to pressure/fear being put on the witness."
