"Accused Appellant Respondent)
clearing what
looked
like
a
red
earth-like"
"substance from the pathway approaching the house. Therefore the main evidence"
"inferring the involvement of the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant of crime is the"
"testimony of PW1."
"It
is
important
to
note
that
even
though witness PW1 had been arrested on"
"suspicion he had never been charged with the commission of
the offence and"
"hence was
never
on
the
footing
of
an
accomplice. This
position
has
been"
"reiterated in the testimony of
the investigating Police Officer (PW9). Therefore"
"the testimony of witness PW1 does not
fall within the footing of section 133 of"
"the Evidence Ordinance of Sri Lanka."
"It
has
been
raised
by
the Learned Counsel
for
the
2nd Accused Appellant"
"Appellant
that
the witness PW1 was first arrested as a suspect but later named as"
"a witness for
the prosecution and that 4 contradictions have been marked in the"
"testimony of the witness during the cross-examination on the witness and that the"
"learned Trial
Judge
had failed to properly evaluate
those
contradictions. The"
"Learned High Court Judge in her Judgement states that
the accused was arrested"
"as an accomplice and upon receiving a pardon has become a witness for the state."
"This contradicts the evidence provided by the Ruwanwella OIC Jayalath Ralalage"
"Senivartane (PW9) in which he stated that
the witness was arrested on suspicion"
"but never named as an accused."
"With regard to the contradictions marked in the testimony of
the witness PW1,"
"the Learned High Court
Judge in her
judgement
stated that when a witness is"
"giving evidence about an occurrence that
took place in the year 1999 in 2013"
"there will be discrepancies as a witness is not expected to have a photographic"
"memory. Even though there were contradictions and lacunas in the testimony of"
"witness PW1 those contradictions are not material because his stance remained"
"unchanged
throughout
the
cross-examination
process. Therefore,
the Learned"
"Judge of
the High Court was of
the opinion that
there was no reasonable doubt"
"raised on testimony provided by the witness. I am in agreement with the stance of"
"the Learned High Court Judge."
