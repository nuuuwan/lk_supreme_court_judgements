"the case of Rex v Cochrane and Others [1814] Gurney’s Report 479, the court"
"held that “No person accused of a crime is bound to offer any explanation of his"
"conduct or of circumstances of suspicion which attach to him; but, nevertheless if"
"he refuses to do so where a strong prima facie case has been made out, and when"
"it
is
in his own power
to offer evidence,
if
such exists,
in explanation of such"
"suspicious circumstances which would show them to be fallacious and explicable"
"consistently with his innocence,
it
is a reasonable and justifiable conclusion that"
"he
refrains
from doing
so
only
from the
conviction
that
the
evidence
so"
"suppressed or not adduced would operate adversely to his interest.”"
"In Krishantha de Silva v The Attorney-General [2003] 1 Sri LR 162,
it was"
"held that“…a prima facie case was made against
the accused.
It
is noted that"
"even though the accused made a statement from the dock he was silent as to what"
"happened after
the deceased was placed on the bed.
I am of
the view that
the"
"statement of
the accused that he did not know anything about the incident cannot"
"be
accepted.
An
accused
person
is
entitled
to
remain
silent
but when
the"
"prosecution has established strong and incriminating evidence against him he is"
"required
to
offer
an
explanation
of
the
highly
incriminating
circumstances"
"established against him.
“Accordingly,
the
court
tends
to apply Ellenborough"
"dictum in such situations."
"In The King v Wickremasinghe [1941] 42 NLR 313,
it was held that “in the"
"absence of an explanation,
the court was entitled to form the opinion that
the"
"accused was directly responsible”. There is a strong and prima facie case against"
"the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant
in the present case. Nevertheless,
the 2nd"
"Accused Appellant Appellant has
failed to adduce any evidence or
to call any"
"witnesses to prove his innocence. The only evidence adduced by the 2nd Accused"
"Appellant Appellant
is the dock statement claiming his innocence however, not"
"provided any explanation nor evidence thereafter."
"Thus,
in my opinion,
the evidence available against
the 2nd Accused Appellant"
"Appellant
is
strong and incriminating;
incompatible
and inconsistent with the"
"innocence of the 2nd Accused Appellant Appellant and consistent with his guilt."
"There
is
consistent
and
cogent
evidence
against
the
2nd Accused Appellant"
"Appellant. The Honourable Judges of the Court of Appeal stated that
there is no"
"reason to doubt
the evidence of PW1 as
there is no inconsistency nor
lack of"
"credibility regarding the evidence. The cumulative effect of all the circumstantial"
"evidence led at
the trial
is the guilt of the 1st Accused Appellant Respondent and"
"the
2nd Accused Appellant Appellant. Therefore,
it
is
evident
that
the
2nd"
