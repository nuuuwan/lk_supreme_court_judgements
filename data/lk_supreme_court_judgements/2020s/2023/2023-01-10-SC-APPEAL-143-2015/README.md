Judgement

Aluwihare PC. J.,

(1) The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

(Applicant) filed an application against the Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) in the Labour Tribunal on the basis

that his services were terminated wrongfully. The Applicant prayed for

reinstatement and back-wages. The learned President of the Labour Tribunal

upheld the application and ordered the reinstatement and payment of back-

wages. Aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant appealed against the award

to the High Court. The learned High Court Judge affirmed the award of the

learned President of the Labour Tribunal and in addition ordered the payment

of back-wages to cover the duration of the inquiry. The Appellant is now

canvassing the said order of the High Court.

(2) When this matter was supported before this court for Special Leave to Appeal,

Special Leave was granted on the following questions of law referred to in

sub-paragraphs (b) (c) and (d) of paragraph 18 of the petition of the

Appellant:

[I] Have both the President of the Labour Tribunal and the learned High

Court Judge overlooked the nature of the employment of the

Respondent?

[II] Have both the President of the Labour Tribunal and the learned High

Court Judge misdirected themselves in ordering reinstatement of

service of the Respondent?

[II] Have both the President of the Labour Tribunal and the learned High

Court Judge erred in fact and law in computing the back wages of the

Respondent?

4

(3) It would be apposite to refer to the facts of the case before examining the

aforementioned questions of law. The Applicant had joined the Appellant, the

Diya-Kithulkanda Co-operative Thrift & Credit society Ltd., as a Cash

Collector on the 25th of August 2007 and continued in service till July 2009.

The Applicant, however, asserts that he had not been paid his salary for the

months of May, June, and July in 2009 and had alleged that when he made

inquiries about the non- payment which was on the 31st July, the Appellant

had stopped providing him with work. According to the Applicant, on the 3rd

of August he had again made further inquiries and he was once again refused

work. Thereafter, on 3rd September 2009 he had filed an application in the

Labour Tribunal claiming relief in the form of reinstatement and back wages

for wrongful termination. According to the Applicant he had been paid a

monthly salary of Rs.10, 000/-. at the time of dismissal.

(4) The Appellant, in their response to the application filed by the Applicant,

maintained that the Applicant, had been recruited on contract basis, initially,

for a period of one year, beginning, 1st August 2007 to work in the delivery

van as a Cash Collector for a Product Distribution Agreement the Appellant

had entered into with Nestle Lanka PLC.in May 2007 [R6]. Initially this had

been for a period of one year. At the expiry of the said contract period,

however, the Applicant was offered an extended contract for the period of one

more year beginning, 1st August 2008 and ending on 31st July 2009 [R16 A]

for services related to the same project. At the expiry of that contract, the

Appellant had decided to extend the contract as a Cash Collector for a further

period of 3 months with effect from 1st August 2009. It is in evidence that the

reason for obtaining services on a contract basis instead of permanent

employment was due to the fact that the services were needed only for the

duration of the subsistence of the distribution agency with Nestle Ltd.

5

(5) It would also be relevant to mention that the Appellant Co-Operative Society

at its General Meeting held, decided to offer employment opportunities

regarding the Nestle project, only to the members of the Society or their

relatives. The Applicant had admitted that, at a General Meeting it was

announced that members can apply for the vacancies in the Nestle project and

accordingly he had applied. The Applicant had also admitted that at the end

the second year, a contract for three months was offered to all employees

attached to the Nestle project.

(6) According to the evidence led, by 2009 April, the project had become a

failure and all persons employed by the project were put on notice that due to

financial issues, the project would be terminated.

(7) The Appellant, in explaining the non-payment of the Applicants salary for

the months of May to August, states that they decided to hold it back till the

Applicant signed the fresh contract extending his services by 3 months. The

Appellant takes up the position that the Applicants services were not

terminated nor was he dismissed from service, but was treated as having

vacated his post, since he did not report for duty after the 1st of August 2009.

(8) Having examined and assessed the evidence produced before the tribunal by

both parties, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal had focused on the

question whether the Appellant had unjustly terminated the services of the

Applicant by refusing to employ him on 31st July and 3rd August 2009 or

whether the Applicant had vacated his post by not reporting for work from

3rd August 2009. The learned President of the Labour Tribunal observed that

the initial recruitment as a Cash Collectors had been on an application made

by the Applicant and no evidence had been adduced to establish that a formal

contract of employment was initially signed or exchanged to establish a

master-servant relationship between the two parties, but the Applicant had

continued in service till July 2009, receiving a monthly salary as

6

remuneration for his work as a Cash Collector. The learned President of the

Labour Tribunal, by the award dated 31st May 2011, ordered the Appellant to

pay, back-wages to the Applicant at the rate Rs.10, 000/- for the months of

May, June and July of 2009, [the three months for which the Applicant

complained that he was not paid] and to pay wages amounting to Rs. 240,000

(10,000 x 24) up to the date of the Tribunals decision, and also to reinstate

the Applicant with effect from 3rd May 2011.

(9) From the tenor e of the award of the Labour Tribunal, it appears that the

learned President of the Labour tribunal had concluded that the Applicants

employment with the Appellant was on a permanent basis for the reason that

the Appellant had neither adduced any material as evidence nor elicited in

the cross examination, to establish that the form of employment offered to the

Applicant was one of a contractual and not of a permanent nature . [Page 5 of

the Award]. This observation in my view, however, does not seem to be

accurate and later in the judgement I have given reasons for the said

conclusion.

(10) Being aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant appealed to the High Court

pleading that the orders referred to in the preceding paragraph were

erroneous on two grounds. Firstly, that despite being employed on a contract

basis for a fixed period of time, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal

had declared the Applicant to be a permanent employee. Secondly, that despite

the Applicants voluntary termination of services by vacating the post, the

learned President of the Labour Tribunal had declared that his services had

been terminated by the Appellant.

(11) The learned High Court Judge, relying on the decision in the case of Ceylon

Cinema and Film Studio Employees Union v. Liberty Cinema Ltd 1994 3 SLR

121 held that the assessment of evidence lies within the province of the

7

Labour Tribunal, and the appellate court cannot review the Labour Tribunals

findings unless the Labour Tribunal had no evidence on record to support its

findings. Accordingly, the Appellant was required to satisfy the High Court

that there was no cogent evidence to support the conclusion reached by the

Tribunal or that the finding was not rationally possible and was perverse

having regard to the material placed before the Tribunal. The learned High

Court Judge, having observed that the Appellant failed to satisfy Court, upheld

the order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal and by its order

dated 21st October 2014, ordered back wages amounting to 42 months

beginning in May 2011 up to September 2014 amounting to a sum of Rs.

420,000 (10,000 x 42), in addition to the wages ordered by the Labour

Tribunal. The learned High Court Judge also affirmed the order of the Labour

Tribunal directing the Appellant to reinstate the Applicant with effect from

30th November 2014.

(12) Before addressing the questions of law on which Special Leave was granted, I

wish to touch on the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court and this Court

as regards appeals from Labour Tribunals. In the case of Kotagala Plantations

Ltd and Lankem Tea and Rubber Plantations (Pvt) Ltd v. Ceylon Planters'

Society SC Appeal 144/2009 SCM 15.12.2010, Chief Justice, De. Silva,

observed that: ... It is not for an Appellate Court to review the evidence and

come to a different conclusion regarding the facts of the case unless the

findings on the facts by the Tribunal was against the weight of the

evidence. Emphasis is mine]

(13) Therefore, this court does not endeavour to re-assess or re-evaluate any facts

unless and otherwise the Appellant has satisfied the court that the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal overlooked or reached conclusions which

were against the weight of the evidence, or the conclusions reached were

rationally impossible or perverse. Therefore, I shall confine my review solely

8

to the order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal, which the

Appellant submits was bad in law having regard to the weight of specific

evidence placed before the Labour Tribunal.

Nature of Employment [1st question of law]

(14) Learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the nature of the Appellants

business as a Co-operative thrift society was such that they would, from

time-to-time, engage in various ventures with a view to generating revenue

for its membership, and the agreement entered into with Nestle Lanka PLC,

[in 2007] to distribute their products in the region, was one such venture. The

management of the Society had also taken a decision to offer any available

employment in connection with the Nestle venture to its own members as it

would be some benefit to them. The Applicant being a member of the Society,

was therefore one among many who was contracted for the specific purpose

of collecting cash from the retailers to whom the merchandise was supplied.

Learned Counsel for the Appellant also noted that the nature of the Applicants

employment was such that it was exclusively confined to the specific venture

and the Applicants admissions before the Labour Tribunal indicate that he

too was aware of this fact. The learned Counsel for the Appellant drew the

attention of the court to the evidence at the inquiry which reveals that the

distribution of products in relation to the Nestle venture was phased out from

about April 2009. The learned Counsels submissions on this matter

concluded by noting how the Applicant was provided employment for two

subsequent years, each for a fixed term, during which the Appellant was

engaged in the venture with Nestle Lanka PLC, and therefore, the Applicants

employment could not have been that of a permanent employee and could

only be one of a fixed term employee. It is the Appellants submission that

therefore both the learned President of the Labour Tribunal as well as the

learned High Court Judge misdirected themselves in holding that the

Applicant was not a fixed term employee. It is the Applicants position, that he

9

was a permanent employee, that he not working on a contract of employment

for a fixed period of time, nor had he entered into any such contract.

(15) As S. R. de Silva notes in The Contract of Employment (1998) para. 179, p.

138, permanent employee refers to persons who serve under a monthly

contract or agreement of employment whereby the agreement upon which

the master-servant relationship operates is renewed at the end of each month

unless it is terminated upon notice by either party.

(16) At the inquiry before the Labour Tribunal, it was revealed that at the stage of

recruitment, although the Appellant had decided to employ Cash Collectors

on a contract basis for a fixed period, no written contract for the year 2007 -

2008 had been executed. R16 is the written contact drawn in the name of the

Applicant signed by the Chairman of the Appellant Co-operative Society for

the period 2008 August to 2009, however, its acceptance had not been

acknowledged by the Applicant. The Applicant nevertheless had admitted at

the inquiry (referenced in pages 13, 28, 29, 31 and 42 in the brief marked

X) that despite the absence of a written contract of employment for a fixed

term, he was aware of the nature of his employment as being exclusively

confined to the Nestle venture. When questioned as to whether the Applicant

was aware that he was employed to work for a period of one year, the

Applicant answered that he had not been provided with notice of such an

arrangement. Furthermore, it is the Appellants submission that the learned

President of the Labour Tribunal had not adduced sufficient weight to the

documentary evidence (R16) provided to the Tribunal indicating the

existence of a fixed-term contract between the Appellant and the Respondent.

(17) As noted by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal, both R16

documents, which appear to be the Applicants letter of appointment and

contract of employment for the period 1st August 2008 to 31st July 2009 do

10

not bear the signature of the Applicant and the Appellant does appears to

have not acted in a professional manner when it came to regularising

employment. Both, witnesses Somalatha [Accountant] and Withanachchi

[Store keeper] of the Co-operative Society had been emphatic that the nature

of the employment that was offered to all the employees relating to the Nestle

venture were of fixed time contracts. It was the evidence of witness

Withanachchi, that they [all those were recruited] were informed that, as the

Society would only be acting as agents for Nestle, they were not being

recruited on a permanent but only on a contract basis.

(18) When one considers the totality of the evidence led, the explanation of the

learned Counsel for the Appellant as to why the Appellant decided to employ

persons, whose services were confined to the Nestle venture, on a Fixed Term

Contract seems rational. Thus, the learned President of the Labour Tribunal

fell into error when he held that the Respondent [present Appellant] had not

placed any evidence either through the cross examination of the Applicant

or by other evidence that the Applicant entered into an employment contract

with the Appellant on an yearly basis Accordingly, I answer the first question

of law in the affirmative and hold that the nature of employment offered to

the applicant was one of a fixed term contract.

Termination of Services

(19) It is established that neither the Appellant nor the Respondent provided notice

of termination of services. Any cessation of service, therefore must necessarily

have been caused by vacation of post by the Applicant or constructive

termination of the Applicants employment by the Appellant.

(20) It would be pertinent to examine the distinct elements of vacation of post as a

means by which an employment is terminated. In a series of cases decided by

this court, it has been established that vacation of post refers to a situation in

11

which the employee terminates his employment by not reporting to work over

a sustained period of time, with no animus revertendi. I wish to examine the

principles enunciated in the cases of Building Materials Corporation v. Jathika

Sevaka Sangamaya (1993) 2 Sri LR 316 and Nelson De Silva v. Sri Lanka State

Engineering Corporation (1996) 2 Sri LR 342.

(21) In Building Materials Corporation v. Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya, Justice Perera

observed that vacation of post occurs as follows: Where an employee

endeavours to keep away from work or refuses or fails to report to work or

duty without an acceptable excuse for a reasonably long period of time such

conduct would necessarily be a ground which justifies the employer to

consider the employee as having vacated service. [At p. 322] (emphasis

added). In Nelson De Silva v. Sri Lanka State Engineering Corporation Justice

Jayasuriya held that [the] concept of vacation of post involves two aspects;

one is the mental element, that is intention to desert and abandon the

employment and the more familiar element of the concept of vacation of post,

which is the failure to report at the workplace of the employee. To constitute

the first element, it must be established that the Applicant is not reporting at

the workplace, was actuated by an intention to voluntarily vacate his

employment. [at p. 343] (emphasis added).

(22) It is therefore evident that to constitute vacation of post, the workman must

not report to or seek work from the employer. It is in evidence that the

Applicant sought work from the Appellant on 31st July and 3rd August 2009.

It is also established that the Applicant worked for the Appellant for the

months of May, June and July without receiving his salary. The Applicants

position is that he inquired about the salary, but the Appellant refused to offer

work to the Applicant, informing him that he would not be provided with

work nor be paid the salary for the months of May, June and July until he

signed the contract extending his services by 3 months from August 2009.

12

From the evidence it is clear that there was a standoff between the two parties,

the Applicant was not agreeable to the extension of the [employment] contract

only for three months, whereas the Appellant was not in a position to offer a

contract for a longer period due to the Nestle project coming to an end. The

Applicants repeated attempts to report for work, prior to his absence from

work due to the Appellants manifest refusal to pay his salary leads me to draw

the conclusion that the Applicant had not vacated his post.

(23) I wish to now examine whether the Applicants services were terminated by

the Appellant. I find the observations of Gunasekara, J. in the case of Pfizer

Limited v. Rasanayagam (1991) 1 Sri LR 290 before the Court of Appeal ad

rem in this aspect. The Applicant, in that case, had communicated that

although he did not report for work, he was willing to work for the employer

and that his absence was a form of protest against the employers order to

report to a colleague who was a junior officer. Gunasekara, J. stated that The

question as to whether a given set of circumstances constitutes a vacation of

employment or a constructive termination is a question of fact to be

determined by the Tribunal having regard to all the facts and circumstances

which transpire in the evidence. [at p. 294].

(24) The case of Warnakulasooriya v. Hotel Developers (Lanka) Ltd, SC Appeal

101/2014 (Decided on 26-07-2018) is helpful in making the

aforementioned determination. The employee in that case had been served

with a letter terminating her services for vacating her post due to prolonged

and sustained absence from employment. It was revealed that the employee

had been unable to report to work due to medical reasons and had reported

for work at the earliest possible date and submitted a medical certificate

confirming the reasons for her absence. This Court, exercising its appellate

jurisdiction held that the mental element of abandonment of employment had

not been established as the employee had returned to work on the earliest

13

possible day, and for that reason the learned President of the Labour Tribunal

and the learned High Court Judge had erred in concluding that the employee

had vacated her post. The Court arrived at the said decision having considered

the weight of documentary evidence placed before the Tribunal which

indicated that the employer had send multiple notices and letters requiring

explanation from hr for her absence.

(25) In the present case, as observed by the learned President of the Labour

Tribunal, not only did the Appellant fail to provide such notice to the

Applicant, but the Appellant had on two occasions expressly denied him work

after he had served without receiving a salary for three consecutive months.

The Appellant has submitted to the Labour Tribunal that it sought to discuss

the Applicants employment after 3rd August 2009 by inviting the Applicant

to attend a discussion by a letter dated 24th August 2009. As observed by the

learned President of the Labour Tribunal, however, there is no proof that such

a letter was communicated to the Applicant

(26) It is my view, therefore, that by not providing the Applicant his salary for three

consecutive months, and thereafter refusing to employ him, the Appellant had

unjustly terminated his employment on the 3rd August 2009.

Order of Reinstatement [2nd question of law]

(27) It is the Appellants submission that the President of the Labour Tribunal and

the learned High Court Judge misdirected themselves by ordering

reinstatement of service of the Applicant whereas the venture in question had

ceased to function. The Applicant maintained that the reinstatement of his

service was just and equitable. The Appellant in its written submission before

this court referred to the decisions in De Silva v. Ceylon Estate Staffs Union,

SC 211/72 SCM 15.05.1974 and United Industrial Local Government and

General Workers Union v. Independent News Papers Ltd 75 NLR 531 to

14

convince the court that the learned President of the Labour Tribunal erred in

ordering reinstatement of the Respondent when the Appellant Co-op Society

had been compelled to terminate its venture with Nestle PLC due to its failure.

(28) In the case of, United Industrial Local Government and General Workers

Union v. Independent News Papers Ltd. [supra], It was held [at p. 531] that

the finding of a workmans termination of service as being unjust does not

entitle the workman to demand reinstatement as a right, nor does it confer

upon the Labour Tribunal an obligation to order reinstatement, the tribunal

is vested with the discretion to determine whether payment of compensation

would be a just alternative to reinstatement. I also wish to note the

observations of Rajaratnam, J. in De Silva v. Ceylon Estate Staffs Union SC

211/72 SCM 15.05.1974: the Tribunal must be mindful of the nature of

the applicants employment, the impact a reinstatement can make on the

industry and the employer/ employee relationship. It should also consider

whether an order of reinstatement would disrupt and disorganize the

management or administration of the business.. [Emphasis added].

Furthermore, it was observed by this court in the case of Jayasuriya vs. Sri

Lanka State Plantation Corporation 1995 2 SLR 379, that even where the

dismissal is unlawful, reinstatement will not invariably be ordered either

where it is inexpedient or where there are unusual features. In such an event,

an award of compensation instead of reinstatement would meet the ends of

justice. The instant case, in my view, is not an instance where reinstatement

of the Applicant is expedient given the nature of the employment the

Applicant was engaged in.

(29) It is established that the Appellants business venture with Nestle Lanka PLC

had completely ceased by 2010. Due to the unique utility Cash Collectors

offered to the Appellant in its venture with Nestle Lanka PLC, the fact that the

venture had ceased due to its financial failure as far as the Appellant was

15

concerned and in particular the nature of employment that was offered to

the Applicant, it is my considered view that the learned President of the

Labour Tribunal erred in ordering reinstatement of the Applicants services

with effect from 3rd May 2011, and the learned High Court Judge erred in

ordering reinstatement of service with effect from 30th November 2014.

(30) Accordingly, I answer the 2nd question of law also in the affirmative.

Payment of Back Wages

(31) It is the Appellants submission that in the event this court finds that the

Respondents employment was terminated unjustly, the duration for the

computation of payment of back wages should not extend beyond the period

of employment the Respondent would have enjoyed, had his employment not

been terminated. I am mindful of the duty of a Labour Tribunal, and

consequently this court, to make such award or order as may appear just and

equitable. The Applicant, no doubt, is entitled to compensation for the sudden

termination, as he would have had a reasonable expectation of continuing

employment within the venture. When computing compensation on the basis

of the Applicants basic salary, the final date of his period of service should be

reconciled with the final date of employment of other persons employed as

Cash Collectors for the Appellants venture with Nestle Lanka PLC. Having

considered all the facts and circumstances of the case, it is my view that that

the compensation ordered by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal is

reasonable and cannot be considered as excessive

(32) Accordingly, the order of the learned President of the Labour Tribunal dated

31st May 2011 ordering back wages amounting to Rs. 240,000 is affirmed.

In my view the order of learned High Court Judge enhancing the back wages

to Rs. 420,000 cannot be justified as the High Court had arrived at the said

figure without proper evaluation of the facts relevant to issue of back wages.

(33) In determining this matter the principle laid down in the case of Jayasuriya

16

vs. Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation [supra] would be relevant. It was

held that In determining compensation what is expected is that after

weighing together of the evidence and probabilities in the case, the Tribunal

must form an opinion of the nature and extent of the loss, arriving at an

amount that a sensible person would not regard as means of extravagant but

would rather consider to be just an equitable in all the circumstances of the

case. The Court also observed [in the case of Jayasuriya] that the burden is

on the employee to adduce sufficient evidence to enable the tribunal to assess

the loss and .if the employee had had obtained equally beneficial or

financially better alternative employment, he should receive no

compensation. In the instant case the Applicant had failed to adduce any

evidence as to loss to him.

(34) Accordingly, the order made by the learned High Court Judge enhancing the

compensation ordered by the President of the Labour Tribunal is set aside and

the order of the Labour Tribunal regarding compensation is affirmed. It is in

evidence that the Applicant was not paid by the Appellant for the months of

June, July and August 2009. That had not been factored in by the Labour

Tribunal when computing the compensation. As such the Appellant is directed

to pay the Applicant a sum of Rs.30,000/- in addition to Rs.240,000/-

ordered by the Labour Tribunal.

Considering the above the 3rd question of law, which has two parts, is

answered in the following manner;

(a) The Labour Tribunal had not erred in fact and law in computing the

back wages of the Applicant and that part of the question is answered

in the negative

(b) The High Court had erred in fact and law in computing the back

wages of the Applicant and that part of the question is answered in

the affirmative.

The Court makes the following orders;

17

(1) The orders made by both the Labour Tribunal and the High Court to

reinstate the Applicant [Respondent] are set aside.

(2) The Applicant would be entitled to compensation in a sum Rs

270,000/-and the Appellant is directed to make this payment within

two months from today.

(3) The Applicant [Respondent] is also entitled for the cost of this case in

a sum of Rs. 40,000/-

Appeal is partially allowed
