Judgement Aluwihare PC. J., This is a case related to the vesting, and subsequent revocation of land taken over by the

Land Reform Commission under the Land Reform Law. The Petitioner-Petitioner-

Appellant [hereinafter the Appellant] seeks to impugn the decision of the Minister to

revoke the vesting of the disputed land in the State Plantations Corporation, which had

leased the said land to the Appellant. This court granted Special Leave to Appeal against

the Order of the Court of Appeal dated 01.11.2007 on the following questions of law.

(a) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal made only an observation on the bare denial of the Respondents

that the DEEGALA DIVISION is not part of the VOGAN ESTATE as against the

strong documentary evidence placed by the Petitioners to the contrary?

(b) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal considered Section 27A(4) of the Land Reform Law in isolation

and having no regard to the material circumstances as set out in detail by the

Petitioner, which contentions were supported by documentation?

(c) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal failed to consider that principles of natural justice would have

warranted a hearing and/or notification to the Petitioner prior to making of the

Revocation Order P10 by Gazette Extraordinary No. 1059/16 dated

24.12.1998?

(d) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal failed to consider that Revocation order P10 itself gives no

reason as to why the said Revocation Order was made?

(e) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal failed to consider that the Petitioner is not only the Lessee of the

entirety of VOGAN ESTATE including the said extent of 94A:2R:14P for a period

of 99 years as stated above, but also holds a Power of Attorney No. 345 dated 4th

May 1995 from the State Plantations Corporation, 2nd Respondent- Respondent

and that the Petitioner would suffer grave prejudice and loss if the said extent of

11

land vests in the Land Reform Commission by virtue of the said Revocation Order?

(f) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal failed to consider that the Revocation Order P10 has been made

by the 1st Respondent despite being well aware that the Petitioner had sought

judicial recourse against the sub lessee for non-payment of the rentals and

moreover without any notice to the Petitioner of the said Revocation order? Thus

had the 1st Respondent acted arbitrarily, ultra vires, with mala fides, in an

unreasonable manner and had been made for an ulterior motive?

(g) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal considered the Revocation Order P10 having no regard to the

commercial complexities applicable to the said VOGAN ESTATE and especially the

DEEGALA DIVISION?

(h) Did the Court of Appeal fail to consider the letter dated 27th February 2003

(X15) by the Land Reform Commission sent to the Petitioner marked P12, by

which letter the Land Reform Commission clearly stated that no further steps

would be taken under and in terms of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1059/16

dated 24.12.1998 to re-vest the DEEGALA DIVISION in the Land Reform

Commission as per the said Gazette notification?

(1) It would be prudent to mention the facts of the case before addressing the questions of

law which warrant determination by this Court. DEEGALA DIVISION is a division of

the VOGAN ESTATE situated in Kalutara and described in Schedule A to the Petition.

By and under virtue of the provisions of the Land Reform Law, No. 1 of 1972 the

VOGAN ESTATE was duly vested in the Land Reform Commission. Thereafter, the

Minister of Forestry, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development acting under and by virtue

of the powers vested under Section 27A of the Land Reform (Special provisions) Act,

No. 39 of 1981, by order published in the Gazette Extraordinary of 21st April 1994

vested the VOGAN ESTATE in the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation.

Subsequently, by and upon Indenture of Lease No. 344 dated 4th of May 1995 attested

by D.C. Pieris Notary Public, the State Plantations Corporation leased the said land,

estate, plantations and premises of VOGAN ESTATE for a period of 99 years

commencing 22nd of June 1992 and ending 31st December 2091 to the Appellant.

12

(2) One Mrs. Gunawardane and family, who were the original owners of the portion of

land-94A.2R.14P comprising part of DEEGALA DIVISION prior to it being vested in

the Land Reform Commission, requested the Ministry of Public Administration, Home

Affairs, Plantation industries and Parliamentary Affairs that an extent of 94A:2R:14P

be leased to them. The Ministry directed the land Reform Commission to lease the said

extent of land out of DEEGALA DIVISION to Mrs. Gunawardane and family.

(3) At this point, the Appellant [Kotagala Plantations Ltd] objected to the lease, maintaining

the position that the aforementioned land, by virtue of being part of the VOGAN

ESTATE was duly vested in the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation, which had in

turn, leased the entirety to the Appellant. A letter dated 23.07.1996 sent by the

Director of Land Alienation of the Land Reform Commission to the Director of the Land

Reform Authority of Kalutara directed that possession be taken of the said extent of

94A:2R:14P out of DEEGALA DIVISION for the purpose of leasing it to Mrs.

Gunawardane and family. The Appellant, having been compelled to seek legal recourse

due to the aforementioned letter, instituted Case No. 4696/Spl in the District Court of

Colombo on 6th August 1996 against the Land Reform Commission, Sri Lanka State

Plantations Corporation and Mrs. Gunawardane. In that case, the Appellant claimed

relief in the form of a declaration that the Appellant is the lawful lessee of VOGAN

ESTATE including DEEGALA DIVISION, a permanent injunction and interim

injunction restraining the Land Reform Commission from entering and/or taking

possession of VOGAN ESTATE including DEEGALA DIVISION, and an interim

injunction restraining Mrs. Gunawardane from entering and/or taking possession of

VOGAN ESTATE including DEEGALA DIVISION.

(4) The Case was fixed for trial in the District Court. In the interim, the Land Reform

Commission and the Ministry agreed that the Appellant should lease the said extent

of 94A:2R:14P to Mrs. Gunawardane and family. DC Colombo Case No. 4696/Spl was

settled and in or around 8th April 1997, the Appellant, by indenture of Lease No. 1594

dated 8th April 1997 attested by Gilbert Somasiri Herath Gunaratne Notary Public, in

pursuance of the authority under the Indenture of Lease No. 344, sub-leased to Mrs.

Gunawardane and her children the allotment of land, estate, plantations and premises

in extent 94A:2R:14P of DEEGALA DIVISION of the VOGAN ESTATE with the buildings

for a period of 50 years commencing 1st November 1996. The Land Reform

13

Commission refunded to the Appellant the sum of Rs. 400,000 paid to it by Mrs.

Gunawardane for the lease rental and the amount was given as credit in favour of Mrs.

Gunawardane and utilised by the Appellant as the first years rental from Mrs.

Gunawardane. A Receipt of Rs. 453,600 received by the Appellant, was provided to

Mrs. Gunawardane.

(5) The terms of the said indenture of lease were such that the Gunawardanes shall pay a

rental of Rs. 453,600 during the first year of the said term, that an yearly rental would

be paid in the manner set out in the lease, that if the yearly rental or any part of it was

unpaid for 60 days after becoming payable, or if any covenant on the part of the

Gunawardanes contained in the indenture were not performed or observed, it shall be

lawful for the Appellant at any time thereafter to re-enter the premises or any part of

it, and that if at any time, any question, dispute or difference of opinion in relation to

or in connection with the lease, or in the interpretation of any provision arises during

the continuance of the lease term, which cannot be amicably settled by the Parties, it

shall be referred to Arbitration.

(6) Having entered into possession of the land, the Gunawardanes failed or neglected to

make payment of rental due as per the lease agreement for the period between 1st

November 1997 to 30th October 1998. Due to the failure of the Arbitration

proceedings which followed as a result of the dispute, the Appellant instituted an

action in the District Court of Colombo bearing No. 5222/Spl against Mrs.

Gunawardane and family seeking inter alia an enjoining order restraining the

Gunawardanes from removing or using any produce of the land. On 27th October

1998, the Court issued the said Enjoining Order prayed for along with notice of

Interim Injunction for the same purpose.

(7) Thereafter, the Minister of Plantation Industries, the relevant Minister at that time; by

Gazette Extraordinary No.1059/16 dated 24.12.1998, acting under Section 27A(4) of

the Land Reform Law, revoked the vesting order made by him in the Gazette

Extraordinary of 21st April 1994 vesting land extent 94A:2R:14P of the DEEGALA

DIVISION of the VOGAN ESTATE in the State Plantations Corporation. It is the validity

of this Revocation Order that was canvassed before the Court of Appeal by the

Appellant.

14

(8) It is the Appellants position that by the vesting order published in the Gazette

Extraordinary of 21st April 1994, the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation became

vested with the title to and ownership of the said land, estate, plantations and premises

of VOGAN ESTATE and that as per Section 27A(4) of the Land Reform Law as amended

by Land Reform (Special Provisions) Act, No.39 of 1981, the Vestee must have failed

to comply with any term or condition in relation to the vesting Order for the Minister

to revoke the vesting Order. The Appellant notes that the said revocation order

provides no reason as to why the revocation order was made, and by virtue of holding

Power of Attorney to the State Plantations Corporation, the Appellant was entitled in

law to be noticed and provided an opportunity of being heard as to why the Revocation

Order was issued. Therefore, the Appellant contends that the said Revocation Order is

arbitrary, mala fide, ultra vires and unreasonable. On this premise, the Appellant

contended before the Court of Appeal that it was entitled in law for an Order in law in

the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the said Revocation Order.

(9) It must be mentioned that no notice of revocation order was provided to the Appellant

until a copy of the said order was produced by the Attorney-at-Law for the Minister of

Plantation Industries in DC Colombo Case No. 4696/Spl on 27th January 1999.

(10) Furthermore, the Appellant contends that in any event, the Revocation Order is not

valid as the Land Reform Commission, in a letter dated 27th February 2003 (X 15),

states that no further steps would be taken under and in terms of the Gazette

Extraordinary No. 1059/16 dated 24.12.1998 for the re-vesting of the DEEGALA

DIVISION in the Commission. The Appellant prays that the of the Court of Appeal

dated 01.11.2007 be set aside and for the issuance of a Writ of Certiorari quashing

the Revocation Order.

(11) The 1st Respondent- Respondents, the Land Reform Commission [LRC] maintains

that the DEEGALA DIVISION was and is not part of the VOGAN ESTATE, that it was

vested separately in the Land Reform Commission, that it was not vested in the State

Plantations Corporation and that the State Plantations Corporation merely managed

the DEEGALA DIVISION- of which the Title Ownership was vested in the Land Reform

Commission. The LRC further submits that the DEEGALA DIVISION was not included

in the Indenture of Lease No. 344 dated 4th May 1995 attested by D.C. Pieris Notary

Public whereby the State Plantations Corporation leased the land, estate, plantations

15

and premises of the VOGAN ESTATE for a period of 99 years commencing 22nd June

1992 and ending 31st December 2091 to the Appellant, and that the State Plantations

Corporation has offered no explanation as to how it considered (if at all) the DEEGALA

DIVISION to be part of the VOGAN ESTATE. The LRC submits that the above matters

are factual disputes and would be best resolved by the District Court, and not by way

of a Writ of Certiorari as prayed by the Appellant. It is of significance to note that when

the Appellant, the LRC and the 2nd Respondent -Respondents, State Plantation

Corporation [SPC] entered into a settlement in the District Court case referred to above,

based on which the Appellant leased DEEGAL DIVISION to Gunawardenas, LRC or the

SPC never took up the position that the DEEGALA DIVISION was not a part of the

Vogan Estate.

(12) Moreover, the LRC submits that, in any event, the terms of condition of the vesting

Order which was breached for the Minister to publish the Revocation Order by the

Extraordinary Gazette is clear as the Vesting Order mentions that the State Plantations

Corporation is bound to pay the Land Reform Commission the nominal value of lands

referred to in the schedule which the State Plantations Corporation failed to fulfil as

it had not paid the Land Reform Commission the nominal value of the lands amounting

to Rs. 14,412,000. The above explanation, the LRC contends, was also made clear in

the affidavit submitted by the then Minister of Plantation Industries. Additionally, the

LRC notes that the duty of diligence to seek out clarity in terms of payments and

documentation on the part of the State Plantations Corporation prior to entering into

a Lease agreement falls upon the Appellant.

(13) The Appellant, during the hearing, took up the position that if non-payment of

consideration for the entire VOGAN ESTATE was the reason for revocation, the

Minister should have revoked the entire estate, not merely the disputed land of extent

94A:2R:14P. The LRC then proceeded to take up a novel position in response. In the

written submission dated 25th February 2019, the LRC argues as follows: that Section

27A(4) offers the relevant Minister the power to revoke the vesting of small portions

of selected land of a vested Estate, and this form of part-vesting and part-revocation of

an estate or land is permitted under Section 27A(1) read together with Section 27A(4)

of the Land Reform Law, and that the above is apparent when considering how part-

vesting and part-revocation conforms with the policy and scheme of the Act whereby

lands vested in the Land Reform Commission may be utilised for multiple purposes and

16

different portions of the same land may be utilised differently.

Is the DEEGALA DIVISION including the land of extent 94A.2R.14P part and parcel of

the VOGAN ESTATE?

(14) Section 27A(1) of the Land Reform (Special provisions) Act, No. 39 of 198 states:

At the request of the Commission, the Minister may, where he considers it necessary

in the interest of the Commission to do so, subject to Sections 22, 23 and 42H, by Order

published in the Gazette, vest, in any State corporation specified in the Order, with

effect from a date specified in that Order, any agricultural land or estate land or any

portion of the land vested in the Commission under this Law, and described in the

Order, subject to terms and conditions relating to consideration for the vesting of that

land in such corporation as may be agreed upon between the Commission and such

Corporation.

(15) It is by virtue of the above provision that by order published in the Gazette

Extraordinary of 21st April 1994 (marked P3) by the Minister, the VOGAN ESTATE

was vested in the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation.

(16) The Hectarage Statement submitted by the Appellant marked P2 notes the

DEEGALA DIVISION comprising 81.15 hectares to be part of the total hectarage of the

VOGAN ESTATE of 847.43 hectares. The Vesting Order which vests the VOGAN

ESTATE in the State Plantation Corporation, marked P3, also states the total hectarage

of the VOGAN ESTATE as 847 hectares. It is also conceded that the 94A:2R:14P leased

to the Gunawardenas, is part of the DEEGALA DIVISION. Even the Court of Appeal had

acknowledged [pages 4 and 5 of the Order] that Board of Directors of the Appellant

Company on a request made by the Ministry of Plantation and Industry, leased out

94A:2R and 14 P to the Gunawardena family the original owners of Deegala Division

which indicates that Deegala Division was part and parcel of the Vogan Estate.

Was the disputed land vested in the State Plantations Corporation?

(17) In addition to the conclusion determined above, I am also of the view for the

purpose of this case, that the LRC cannot maintain the position that DEEGALA

DIVISION was not vested in the State Plantations Corporation while also maintaining

17

the argument that the Revocation Order revoked the vesting of the same land in any

event. This, in essence, as pointed out by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Appellant, constitutes an admission that the disputed extent of land was in fact vested

in the State Plantations Corporation since that which has not been vested cannot be

revoked.

Is the Revocation Order bad in law?

(18) The determination of the court in this regard is whether part-vesting and part-

revocation is permissible in law as per Section 27A(1) and Section 27A(4) of the Land

Reform Act, and if so, whether the order for part-revocation in the present case was

lawful.

(19) Section 27A(4) of the Land Reform (Special provisions) Act, No. 39 of 1981 states:

Where any term or condition relating to consideration for the vesting of any

agricultural land or estate land or portion thereof in any State Corporation by an Order

under subsection (1) is not complied with, the Minister may by Order published in the

Gazette, revoke the Order under subsection (1) relating to that land and thereupon

that land shall revest in the Commission.

(20) It is by virtue of the above provision that by order published in the Gazette

Extraordinary No.1059/16 dated 24.12.1998 (marked P10) the Minister revoked

the vesting order made by the former Minister in the Gazette Extraordinary of 21st

April 1994 vesting land extent 94A:2R:14P of the DEEGALA DIVISION of the VOGAN

ESTATE in the State Plantations Corporation. It is to be noted that this is the exact extent

of land that was leased to Gunawardenas by the Appellant.

(21) It is the LRCs contention that the term or condition relating to consideration for

the vesting Order which the State Plantations Corporation has failed to comply with is

the payment of a nominal value of Rs. 14,412,000 for the lands, premises and estate

of the VOGAN ESTATE. This is the pith and substance on which the Court of Appeal

refused to quash the vesting order. To appreciate that no material was placed before

this Court supporting the failure of payment as reason for revocation besides the

affidavit of the Minister himself dated 20th July 1999 which states that the State

Plantations Corporation failed to pay due consideration of Rs. 14,412,000 as the

18

nominal value of the entire estate. This allegation was strenuously disputed by the

Appellant as well as the State Plantations Corporation. The monies were due to the

LRC, and consequently, it was incumbent upon the LRC and not the Minister to

complain about the non-payment. The Vesting Order P 3 does not require the

payment of consideration within a stipulated time and therefore it follows that even if

the State Plantations Corporation had failed to pay, the revocation could not have been

done without providing an opportunity to pay. In any case, it must be borne in mind

that the Ministers allegation is that that the State Plantations Corporation failed to pay

due consideration of Rs. 14,412,000 as the nominal value of the entire estate. The

succeeding question then, is why the specific land of extent 94A.2R.14P of the

DEEGALA DIVISION alone was revoked and re-vested in the Land Reform Commission,

and not the entire Division or Estate. Therefore, even if partial revocation may be

permissible, for the present Revocation Order to stand it must be proven that the State

Plantations Corporation failed to provide consideration of a defined amount for the

specific extent of land.

(22) There is no mention of consideration being apportioned and assigned for the

specific extent of land to the State Plantations Corporation, and the Respondents have

failed to provide any reason for the partial revocation as divorced from the non-

payment of nominal fees for the entire Estate. This is a pertinent consideration since

the LRC, in the written submission dated 25th February 2019 submits that the policy,

and underlying reasoning behind the part-revocation was that there were various

utilities in different portions of lands held for the State. Although the LRCs argument

does conform to the purpose of the act spelled out in the the preamble to the Land

Reform Law- which provides inter alia to prescribe the purposes and the manner

of disposition by the commission of agricultural lands vested in the commission so as

to increase productivity and employment,, no such reasoning, as applicable for the

disputed portion of land of extent 94:A:2R:14P has been offered, and no specific use

or viability of purpose the land possesses that other lots of land in the VOGAN ESTATE

do not hold has been noted either by the Respondents.

(23) Therefore, even if it could be established that the Minister was entitled to revoke

the vesting order due to the State Plantations Corporations alleged failure to pay

consideration for the entire state, and part-revocation is permissible under Section

27A(1) and Section 27A(4) of the Land Reform Act, it cannot be established that the

19

Minister was entitled to revoke the specific extent of land pertinent to the present

dispute.

(24) The exact portion of land that was revoked i.e. 94A:2R:14P was the extent of the

land which was sub-leased to the Gunawardenas by the Appellant. This reality,

considered with the fact that no reasoning was provided for the exclusive revocation

could only lead to the conclusion that the revocation was effected for the collateral

purpose of benefiting the Gunawardenas alone.

(25) In Sugathapala Mendis Vs. Chandrika Kumaratunga [2008] 2 Sri LR 339, Her

Ladyship Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane, in determining whether the acts impugned

in that case constituted a public purpose, held [at page 360] that the primary object

of public purpose is the general interest of the community. Though in achieving the

public purpose the individual or individuals may be benefited, the benefit to such

individual or individuals must only be indirect.

(26) While 27A(4) of the Land Reform (Special provisions) Act, No. 39 of 1981 does

not expressly restrict the Ministers power to revoke lands vested for public

purposes, I am of the view that any actions taken under the Act must conform to the

policy considerations contemplated by the legislature in enacting such act. This view

was also taken by five Lordships of this Court in Jayanetti Vs. The Land Reform

Commission & Others [1984] 2 SLR 172, where the Court, referring to the preamble

of the Land Reform Law stated that alienations should be strictly confined to purposes

which would ensure productivity or utilization of manpower, and not for other

reasons. All activity of the Commission is subsumed under overriding policy

considerations [at page 189]. Revocation of the portion of land which constitutes

the exact portion of land the Gunawardenas have sought does not in any way

contribute to effecting the purposes of the Land Reform Law or the Land Reform

(Special provisions) Act. Therefore, it is evident that the Minister published the

Revocation Order for an arbitrary, collateral purpose and is therefore bad in law and

liable to be quashed.

Was the Minister bound to provide the Petitioner notice in advance and/or a hearing

prior to publishing the Revocation Order per Principles of Natural Justice?

(27) No administrative body or executive organ exercising an administrative function

20

is entitled to escape the requirements of Natural Justice. The jurisprudence of our

courts has not wavered in this conviction; therefore, I do not find it necessary to

reproduce dicta in this regard. The Appellant was not provided notice in advance of

the revocation; neither was the Appellant granted a hearing before the revocation

order was published. This is not disputed by the Respondents. Therefore, it is ex facie

evident that the Minister, being a creature of the Constitution and exercising an

administrative function bound to adhere to the immutable principle of audi alteram

partem, had lamentably failed in such adherence.

(28) This failure is further aggravated by the manner in which the resort to judicial

recourse by the Appellant for the non-payment of rentals by the sub-lessee

(Gunawardenas) was neglected in publishing the revocation order particularly where

letter dated 27th February 2003, states that no further steps would be taken under and

in terms of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1059/16 dated 24.12.1998 for the re-

vesting of the DEEGALA DIVISION in the Commission.

Conclusion

For the aforementioned reasons, I answer the questions of law upon which leave was

granted in the following manner.

(a) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal made only an observation on the bare denial of the Respondents

that the DEEGALA DIVISION is not part of the VOGAN ESTATE as against the

strong documentary evidence placed by the Petitioners to the contrary?

Yes.

(b) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal considered Section 27A(4) of the Land Reform Law in isolation

and having no regard to the material circumstances as set out in detail by the

Petitioner, which contentions were supported by documentation?

Yes.

(c) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal failed to consider that principles of natural justice would have

warranted a hearing and/or notification to the Petitioner prior to making of the

21

Revocation Order P10 by Gazette Extraordinary No. 1059/16 dated

24.12.1998?

Yes.

(d) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal failed to consider that Revocation order P10 itself gives no

reason as to why the said Revocation Order was made?

Yes.

(e) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal failed to consider that the Petitioner is not only the Lessee of the

entirety of VOGAN ESTATE including the said extent of 94A:2R:14P for a period

of 99 years as stated above, but also holds a Power of Attorney No. 345 dated 4th

May 1995 from the State Plantations Corporation, 2nd Respondent- Respondent

and that the Petitioner would suffer grave prejudice and loss if the said extent of

land vests in the Land Reform Commission by virtue of the said Revocation Order?

Yes.

(f) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal failed to consider that the Revocation Order P10 has been made

by the 1st Respondent despite being well aware that the Petitioner had sought

judicial recourse against the sub lessee for non-payment of the rentals and

moreover without any notice to the Petitioner of the said Revocation order? Thus

had the 1st Respondent acted arbitrarily, ultra vires, with mala fides, in an

unreasonable manner and had been made for an ulterior motive?

Yes.

(g) Did the Court of Appeal err in fact and in law when the Learned Justice of the

Court of Appeal considered the Revocation Order P10 having no regard to the

commercial complexities applicable to the said VOGAN ESTATE and especially the

DEEGALA DIVISION?

Yes.

(h) Did the Court of Appeal fail to consider the letter dated 27th February 2003

(X15) by the Land Reform Commission sent to the Petitioner marked P12, by

22

which letter the Land Reform Commission clearly stated that no further steps

would be taken under and in terms of the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1059/16

dated 24.12.1998 to re-vest the DEEGALA DIVISION in the Land Reform

Commission as per the said Gazette notification?

Yes.

In view of the conclusions reached, and considering the facts and circumstances

of this case a writ in the nature of certiorari is allowed quashing the Revocation

Order P10 published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1059/16 dated

24.12.1998 and I direct that no steps or measures are taken under such Order.

Accordingly, the Order of the Court of Appeal dated 01.11.2007 is set-aside.

Appeal allowed.
