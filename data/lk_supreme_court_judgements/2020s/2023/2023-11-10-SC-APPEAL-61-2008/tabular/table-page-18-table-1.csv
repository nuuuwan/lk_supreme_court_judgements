"nominal  value  of  the  entire  estate.  This  allegation  was  strenuously  disputed  by  the"
"Appellant  as well as the State Plantations Corporation.  The monies were due to the"
"LRC,  and  consequently,  it  was  incumbent  upon  the  LRC  and  not  the  Minister  to"
"complain  about  the  non-payment.  The  Vesting  Order  “P  3”  does  not  require  the"
"payment of consideration within a stipulated time and therefore it follows that even if"
"the State Plantations Corporation had failed to pay, the revocation could not have been"
"done without providing an opportunity to pay. In any case, it must be borne in mind"
"that the Minister’s allegation is that that the State Plantations Corporation failed to pay"
"due  consideration  of  Rs.  14,412,000  as  the  nominal value of the entire estate.  The"
"succeeding  question  then,  is  why  the  specific  land  of  extent  94A.2R.14P  of  the"
"DEEGALA DIVISION alone was revoked and re-vested in the Land Reform Commission,"
"and  not  the  entire  Division  or  Estate.  Therefore,  even  if  partial  revocation  may  be"
"permissible, for the present Revocation Order to stand it must be proven that the State"
"Plantations Corporation failed to provide consideration of a defined amount for the"
"specific extent of land."
