"(8) It  is  the  Appellantâ€™s  position  that  by  the  vesting  order  published  in  the  Gazette"
"Extraordinary of 21st April 1994, the Sri Lanka State Plantations Corporation became"
"vested with the title to and ownership of the said land, estate, plantations and premises"
"of VOGAN ESTATE and that as per Section 27A(4) of the Land Reform Law as amended"
"by Land Reform (Special Provisions) Act, No.39 of 1981, the Vestee must have failed"
"to comply with any term or condition in relation to the vesting Order for the Minister"
"to  revoke  the  vesting  Order.  The  Appellant  notes  that  the  said  revocation  order"
"provides no reason as to why the revocation order was made, and by virtue of holding"
"Power of Attorney to the State Plantations Corporation, the Appellant was entitled in"
"law to be noticed and provided an opportunity of being heard as to why the Revocation"
"Order was issued. Therefore, the Appellant  contends that the said Revocation Order is"
"arbitrary, mala fide,  ultra vires  and  unreasonable.  On  this  premise,  the  Appellant"
"contended before the Court of Appeal that it was entitled in law for an Order in law in"
"the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the said Revocation Order."
