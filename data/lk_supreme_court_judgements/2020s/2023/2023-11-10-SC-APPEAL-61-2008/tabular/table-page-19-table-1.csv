"Minister  was  entitled  to  revoke  the  specific  extent  of  land  pertinent  to  the  present"
"dispute."
"(24) 
The exact portion of land that was revoked i.e. 94A:2R:14P was the extent of the"
"land  which  was  sub-leased  to  the  Gunawardenas  by  the  Appellant.  This  reality,"
"considered with the fact that no reasoning was provided for the exclusive revocation"
"could only lead to the conclusion that the revocation was effected for the collateral"
"purpose of benefiting the Gunawardenas alone."
"(25) 
In Sugathapala Mendis Vs. Chandrika Kumaratunga  [2008]  2  Sri  LR  339,  Her"
"Ladyship Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane, in determining whether the acts impugned"
"in that case constituted a “public purpose”, held [at page 360] that the primary object"
"of “public purpose” is the general interest of the community. Though in achieving the"
"public  purpose  the  individual  or  individuals  may  be  benefited,  the  benefit  to  such"
"individual or individuals must only be indirect."
"(26) 
While 27A(4) of the Land Reform (Special provisions) Act, No. 39 of 1981 does"
"not  expressly  restrict 
the  Minister’s  power 
to  revoke 
lands  vested 
for  “public"
"purposes”, I am of the view that any actions taken under the Act must conform to the"
"policy considerations contemplated by the legislature in enacting such act. This view"
"was  also  taken  by  five  Lordships  of  this  Court  in  Jayanetti Vs. The Land Reform"
"Commission & Others [1984] 2 SLR 172, where the Court, referring to the preamble"
"of the Land Reform Law stated that “alienations should be strictly confined to purposes"
"which would ensure productivity or utilization of manpower, and not for other"
"reasons. All activity of the Commission is subsumed under overriding policy"
"considerations…” [at page 189]. Revocation of the portion of land which constitutes"
"the  exact  portion  of  land  the  Gunawardenas  have  sought  does  not 
in  any  way"
"contribute  to  effecting  the  purposes  of  the  Land  Reform  Law  or  the  Land  Reform"
"(Special  provisions)  Act.  Therefore,  it  is  evident  that  the  Minister  published  the"
"Revocation Order for an arbitrary, collateral purpose and is therefore bad in law and"
"liable to be quashed."
"Was the Minister bound to provide the Petitioner notice in advance and/or a hearing"
"prior to publishing the Revocation Order per Principles of Natural Justice?"

No administrative body or executive organ exercising an administrative function"
