of Rs. 20 million in terms of section 26 of the Bribery Act.

Aggregate sentence imposed on the 2nd Accused-Appellant

12 years Rigorous Imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 55000

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence imposed on them by the High Court at Bar,

both Accused Appellants had preferred two appeals to the Supreme Court under and in terms of

section 12 B of the Judicature Act (as amended) read with the provisions of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 (as amended) His Lordship the Chief Justice had nominated the

present bench in terms of section 12B of the Judicature Act (as amended) to hear and determine

the said appeals and the two Accused-Appellants appeared through their counsel in the hearing of

their appeals before this Court.

As already referred to above, the two Accused-Appellants were indicted before the High Court at

Bar under the provisions of the Bribery Act for the solicitation and acceptance of bribes. As at the

time of the offence, the 1st Accused-Appellant was the Chief of Staff at the Presidential Secretariat

and the 2nd Accused-Appellant was the Chairman of State Timber Corporation. The Complainant K.P.

Nagarajah an Indian National was involved in Sugar Industry and acted as a representative/

shareholder to a foreign investor who was interested in purchasing the state-owned Kanthale Sugar

Factory. The evidence led before the High Court at Bar revealed (which I will consider when

analyzing the evidence) that the Complainant had observed an inordinate delay in implementing the

unsolicited proposal to purchase the Kanthale Sugar Factory when the matter had been approved by

the Cabinet of Ministers. 1st Accused-Appellant being the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands, during

the period in question was handling this matter by himself and the complainant had taken up the

position that the 1st Accused-Appellant had solicited a bribe of US $ 3 million. Since the Complainant

was not happy with the progress made, he brought it to the notice of an official in the Prime

Ministers Officer and the matter had referred to the CIABOC by an Additional Secretary to the

Prime Ministers Officer. The Complainant Nagarajah had appeared before the Investigation Unit of

CIABOC on a telephone message received by the said division.

During the same period virtual complainant had a few meetings with the two accused and it was the

position of the witness that the accused had solicited a sum of Rs. 20 million as an advance in order

to finalize matters pending at that time and a successful raid had been carried out on the 3rd May

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 11 of 145 2018 at Hotel Taj Samudra Colombo when the 1st Accused-Appellant accepted a bribe of Rs. 20

million from the complainant and the 2nd Accused-Appellant too was arrested on charges of

abetment.

The indictment that was served on the two Accused-Appellant contained out charges into a series of

events that took place in the process of the solicitation and acceptance of the bribe including the

original solicitation of US $ 3 million and the subsequent events that took place at the office of the

2nd Accused-Appellant and at Bread Talk restaurant and finally the acceptance that took place at Taj

Samudra Hotel Colombo.

During the arguments before us, the two Accused-Appellants raised several grounds of appeal, and

the grounds that were raised before us can be summarized as follows,

*Was the investigation into the complaint received by the CIABOC against the Appellants,

conducted by officers of the CIABOC in a lawful manner? (Was the investigation lawful?)

*The Indictment was ex facia ultra vires the provisions of section 11 of the CIABOC ACT

*Have the charges in the indictment (joinder of charges) been framed in a lawful manner? More

particularly, is the amalgamation of charges 1 and 2 with the rest of the charges lawful, in

that, has the prosecution established that the offences contained in charges 1 and 2 were

committed in the course of the same transaction with the offences contained in the remaining

charges?

*Has the Prosecution proved aliunde that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two or

more persons have conspired together to commit an offence? If not, was resorting to section 10 of

the Evidence Ordinance lawful?

*When the admissibility of voice recording was challenged at the time the prosecution sought to

place such recordings before the Court as evidence, was it lawful for the trial judge to have

differed taking a decision on the matter till the end of the trial? or in the alternative, Was it

incumbent on the trial court to have conducted a voire dire inquiry into the matter and make a

prompt ruling regarding the admissibility of the impugned voice recordings?

*Was the procedure the trial judges had adopted by deferring the decision on the admissibility of

the Voice recordings, Cause a miscarriage of Justice?

*Did the Magistrate have power/Judicial Authority to give voice samples to the Government

Analyst? Was the compulsion of the Appellants to give voice samples to the Government Analyst

a breach of the rules against self-incrimination and did it cause a miscarriage of Justice?

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 12 of 145 *Is Voice Analysis in the manner conducted by Witness Gunathilaka, Assistant Examiner of

Questioned Documents of the Government Analyst Department a Science?

*What amounts to Safe Custody as per Section 4 (1)(d) of the Evidence (Special provisions) Act?

Were the Voice recordings in Safe custody, when the recorded conversations were in a mobile

phone, which was in the custody of the virtual Complainant? Has the fact that the voice

recordings were in the custody of the Virtual Complainant, resulted in the recordings becoming

inadmissible

*Were the two Accused-Appellants entrapped to commit the offence they have been convicted

of, and if so, have they been deprived of a fair trial?

*In view of the alleged infirmities in the testimony given by the virtual Complainant, can

credibility and testimonial trustworthiness be attached to his testimony?

*Did the virtual Complainant have a motive to falsely implicate the Accused?

* Did the two Accused Appellants possess any motive to solicit and or accept a bribe as narrated

by the virtual complainant?

In considering the grounds that were raised on behalf of the Accused-Appellants before this Court, it

is useful for this Court to first analyze the factual Matrix as revealed before Court during the

arguments.

As already referred to above, the prosecution before the High Court at Bar, led the evidence of 22

witnesses including the evidence of witness Nagarajah, the virtual complainant in this case.

According to the testimony of witness Nagarajah, he has first come to Sri Lanka in 1994 seeking the

prospects of investing in the apparel sector due to the GSP+ stimulus package that the Sri Lankan

Government had been enjoying during that time. Thereafter, in 2011 he had decided to invest in the

local sugar industry and had taken part in the international tender called for by the then Sri Lankan

Government for Kanthale Sugar Factory. The tender process had been called off before its

completion.

The second attempt of the witness to have the Kanthale Sugar Factory project comes to light in

2015, with the establishment of a new Government. According to the witness, he had submitted an

unsolicited proposal to the then Minister in charge of Lands, under whose purview Kanthale Sugar

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 13 of 145 Factory project had been listed. The proposal came through Sri Prabhulingeshvar Sugars and

Chemicals Company, which has its origins in India and is one of the largest in the global sugar

industry. The project proposal is not only for manufacturing sugar but also to produce ethanol,

electricity, and organic fertilizer on larger scales as by-products while empowering the farming

community with financial assistance and improving their welfare. The proposal suggested a joint

venture company to manage Kanthale Sugar Factory of which 51% of shares are owned by the Sri

Lankan Government and 49% by the Investor Company. The total investment was estimated to be a

Hundred million USD based on Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) as opposed to Build Operate and

Owned (BOO). A cabinet memorandum dated 14.02.2015 had been submitted for approval in this

regard by the then Minister of Lands the late Mr. M.K.D.S. Gunawardena.

A cabinet subcommittee comprised of three Cabinet Ministers who were appointed to evaluate the

said proposal and to report back to the Cabinet of Ministers (P20). The said Cabinet Sub-Committee

had referred the project proposal to the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (hereinafter referred to as

BOI) to evaluate the feasibility of the project. During this time, the BOI had been in receipt of

another project proposal in respect of the same project from a company called Jupiter Sugars (PVT)

Ltd., also from India. (P23)

Having considered the capability, capacity, and experience in the related area, the Cabinet of

Ministers on 25.06.2015 approved the proposal submitted by the witness with the concurrence of

the BOI. (P24), (P25), (P26)

Witness Nagarajah, on behalf of the Investor Company (at that point of time) MG Sugars Lanka (PVT)

Ltd, had entered into an Agreement with BOI on 27th July 2015 as an initial step to commence with

the Kanthale Sugar Factory project (P5).

The drafting and preparation of the Shareholders Agreement which was the next stage of this

project had prolonged for 13 months. For the project to be carried out in Sri Lanka, a Sri Lankan

Company named M.G. Sugars Private Limited was incorporated as a Special purpose vehicle to

undertake the business of revival/ restructuring of the sugar industry in Kanthale through the

formation and set up a new sugar factory and associated enterprises and the involvement of the

local farming community The Sri Lankan Government was given shares in the aforesaid Sri Lankan

Company as it was a party to this project in terms of the proposals. Further, the investment was

channeled via a Company incorporated in Singapore named S.L.I. Development Private Limited

which comprised Sri Prabhulingeshvar Sugars and Chemical Industries Ltd, Mendel Gluck, Nagarajah,

and Moussa Salem (P6). It was later observed that the said S.L.I. Development Private Limited had

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 14 of 145 also been brought into the Shareholders Agreement. As the initial proposal approved by the Cabinet

of Ministers was for the project proposal by Sri Prabhu Lingeshwar Sugar and Chemical Company, it

was decided to obtain the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers before signing the agreement by the

Government of Sri Lanka and S.L.I. Development Private Limited. The Cabinet of Ministers granted

the approval on 14th June 2016 and the Shareholders Agreement was signed on 11th November

2016.

After signing the Shareholders Agreement, in terms of Art. 7.9 of the said Agreement, the

Government of Sri Lanka, which held 51% of the shares of MG Sugars Lanka (PVT) Ltd., was

supposed to release the agreed existing infrastructure, machinery, and buildings of the existing

Kanthale Sugar Factory along with surrounding 500 acres of land to the said MG Sugars Lanka (PVT)

Ltd. in order to commence its operations. (P6C)

Witness Nagarajah claimed that a few days after the Shareholders Agreement was signed

(11.08.2016), he had a meeting with the first Accused-Appellant in the capacity of the Secretary to

the Ministry of Lands, under which the subject of the Kanthale Sugar Factory had been listed. It is at

this meeting, according to the witness, the first Accused-Appellant solicited Three Million USD from

him in order to facilitate the execution of the proposed project. The witness had neither refused,

nor agreed to the said solicitation knowing the fact that the first Accused-Appellant, being the

Secretary of the Ministry in charge of the Project can easily scuttle the whole process.

The witness had observed that even after several months of signing the Shareholders Agreement,

the first Accused-Appellant failed to comply with the agreed requirements of the said Agreement,

and that had gone to the extent of refraining from appointing his nominee.

A letter dated 25.10.2016 from the then Chairman of BOI to the first Accused-Appellant had

solicited his assistance to expedite the process to initially divest relevant lands for factory, nursery

and staff residences as provided for in Article 7.1.1(a), 7.1.1 (b) and 7.1.1 (d) of the Shareholders

Agreement to the said enterprise to facilitate preparation work of the project to be implemented

within the given timeline enabling the investor to proceed with preliminary work on land clearance

and clearance of old buildings as the implementation of the Agreement is time bound with the bank

guarantee

It is at that point the first Accused-Appellant wrote a letter dated 2.11.2016 addressed to the

Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, with a copy to the Chairman of BOI seeking advice on the

following matters in order to proceed with the Joint Venture

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 15 of 145

i. The conditions to be adopted on releasing lands as Article 09 of

the Shareholders Agreement affirms that the Government has the

authority of 51% of shares of the company.

ii. As part of the revival process, of the Kanthale Sugar Factory,

the Ministry of Lands already obtained a sealed valuation from the

Government Valuer for machinery and other available resources

within the factory premise.

iii. As such, the procedures to be adopted on implementation of

Article 7.9 of the Shareholders Agreement

It is in this process that the witness wrote a letter dated 5.12.2016 to the Secretary to the Treasury,

with a copy to the first Accused-Appellant, requesting to make necessary arrangements for the

leasing of land as per the Agreement in order to commence activities immediately, since 4 months

have already passed after the signing of the Shareholders Agreements. (P67)

In the meantime, the Secretary to the then Prime minister, on behalf of the Cabinet Committee on

Economic Management (hereinafter referred to as CCEM) had written to the first Accused-Appellant

that The Ministry of Lands has not yet handed over the Land of Kanthale Sugar Plant to the New

Investor. The CCEM instructions were given to the Secretary, Ministry of Lands to hand over the

land and report back at the Next CCEM Meeting. (P68).

The first Accused-Appellant had then written to the Hon Attorney General on 16/1/2017 with a copy

of the Shareholders Agreement attached thereto, soliciting assistance to sort out two matters to

proceed with the implementation of the said Agreement. (P70)

i. There is an issue in deciding the consideration of a Lease Agreement for the State Lands to

be given to the company since the said Lands are to be given in lieu of the 51% shares of the

Government.

ii. Even though the Shareholders Agreement affirms the investor to take possession of land,

premises, infrastructure, and machinery, no instructions were given on transferring these resources,

approximately valued at Rs.300Mn by the chief valuer.

Several letters had been exchanged thereafter between MG Sugar, CCEM, and the 1st Accused-

Appellant about the lease of land as per the agreements already signed but once again the 1st

Accused-Appellant wrote to the Hon. Attorney General on 16.03.2017 soliciting advice on:

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 16 of 145

i.the conditions to be adopted in releasing lands to the investor; and

ii.the procedures to be adopted in disposing the existing infrastructure, machinery, and

other movable properties when implementing the Shareholders Agreement. (P76)

However, in a letter dated 20/3/2017 by the Hon. Attorney General to the 1st Accused-Appellant, in

reply to P76, observed . that although the BOI Agreement was signed on 27/5/2015 and the

Shareholders Agreement was executed on 11/8/2016, the said project has not commenced yet and

there was inordinate delay. Accordingly, the first Appellant was advised by the Hon. Attorney

General: (P77)

i.As regards the releasing of lands to the investor, the modalities are expressly

provided in Article 7.1.1. of the Shareholders Agreement. There are no extraneous

conditions to be complied with when releasing the said land, and it is incumbent

upon the signatories to the said Agreement to strictly abide by the provisions of the

said Article. In view of the concerns expressed at the CCEM about the long delay, this

process should be completed expeditiously as possible.

ii.Regarding the disposal of existing infrastructure, machinery, and other movable

properties, the open tender procedure should be followed within a stipulated time

frame.

On or about 18th May 2017, the 1st Accused Appellant met the virtual complainant at the Royal Boat

Restaurant in Wattala for a meeting over dinner (the 1st Accused Appellant denied such meeting).

The 1st Accused-Appellant had then informed the virtual complainant that if he does not pay the

solicited gratification, he would take steps to call for tenders to dispose of the existing machinery.

When the New paper advertisements were published inviting bids to demolish the buildings and sell

the equipment as per the instructions of the Hon. Attorney General, the Legal consultants of MG

Sugars (Pvt) Ltd wrote to the 1st Accused-Appellant that they have been instructed by their client to

institute legal action against the 1st Accused-Appellant if the said invitation for bids is not publicly

revoked with immediate effect. The said decision to sell the equipment was the subject matter in an

arbitration proceeding commenced in Singapore by MG Sugars (Pvt) Ltd thereafter.

In reply to another letter sent by the 1st Accused-Appellant on 04.08.2017, Hon. Attorney General

had observed the following (P83)

Upon consideration of the available documentation, it is quite clear that the

Ministry of Lands and the BOI have not shared a common understanding or

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 17 of 145

Agreement pertaining to a revival/restructuring of Kanthale Sugar Factory. As a

result, there has been a plethora of letters forwarded to this Department seeking

legal clarification on specific matters which are particularly relied upon or perceived

by the respective institutions. This has led to five (05) opinions tendered by this

Department.

Whilst the exchange of letters, discussions, and consultations take place amongst the stakeholders

to the Shareholders Agreement from 11/8/2016 up until P83 was issued by the Hon. Attorney

General on 17/8/2017, witness Nagarajah says that he received a call on 05.09.2017 from the

second Accused-Appellant, who was known to him previously, requesting him to come to Waters

Edge Hotel at Battaramulla in the evening of the same day. Witness had gone to Waters Edge Hotel

as agreed upon and during the conversation, the second Accused-Appellant had told the witness

that the first Accused-Appellant is disappointed over the recent developments pertaining to the

Kanthale Sugar Factory project, especially the adverse media publicity against him.

Witness had not specified whether he wished to pay the solicited amount of bribe indicated by the

second Accused Appellant but has indicated that he will have to discuss this issue with the other

directors of the company.

It was also claimed by the witness that he recorded this conversation with the second Accused-

Appellant by using his mobile phone.

In the meantime, MG Sugars Lanka (PVT) Ltd., through its Attorneys, informed the first Accused-

Appellant on 6/10/2017 as follows:

Due to the failure and/or neglect of the Government of Sri Lanka to resolve the

matter amicably, and despite the numerous bonafide efforts made by our client in this,

the same was referred to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (CIAC)

As such, an Emergency Interim Relief Agreement (EIRA) was made in terms of Rule 30.2

and Schedule 1 of the CIAC Rules.

Pursuant to the aforementioned application, a hearing was held via telephonic

conference on the 29th of September 2017 at 11 a.m. Sri Lanka time. Subsequently, an

award of Emergency Interim Relief was delivered in favour of our client..

Therefore, you are now compelled to maintain the status quo and are restrained from

carrying out any demolition and/or removal exercise of any infrastructure, machinery,

buildings and/or implements situated within the said lands. (P84)

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 18 of 145 Witness Nagarajah had testified before the High Court at Bar that he provided a Bank Guarantee of

USD 10Mn in favour of the Government of Sri Lanka for several years by that time and has spent

around USD 12Mn as consultancy fees and other expenditures in relation to the project. Considering

the arbitration process, the Cabinet Sub Committee decision, and the huge amount that he had to

spend during this time, he claims that he was frustrated and left with no option but to complain to

the political hierarchy about what was going on in respect of the Kanthale Sugar Factory project.

It is against this backdrop that witness Nagarajah, had made a written complaint dated 7/2/2018 to

the then Prime Minister. The witness was given an audience by a senior official of the Prime

Ministers office on 9/2/2018 who had advised him that he should raise this issue with CIABOC if he

claims that a bribe has been solicited by a Government Official.

ASP/Ruwan Kumara, PW 2, the then Deputy Director (Investigations) of CIABOC confirmed that he

was advised by his Immediate Senior Officer, Director (Investigations) on 9/2/2018, that an Indian

National is expecting to lodge a complaint with CIABOC and to take further steps in that regard. The

mobile telephone number of the said Indian National had also been provided. Several attempts by

ASP/Ruwan Kumara to contact the said complainant had not been successful, but he had returned a

call to PW 2 on the same day. Thereafter Kotagarahalli Peddapaiya Nagarajah the said Indian

National had gone to meet ASP/Ruwan Kumara, at his office at CIABOC around 3.30 p.m. on

9/2/2018 itself.

After listening to the narration of witness Nagarajah, PW 2 informed him that a written complaint

should be submitted in order to commence the investigations over the allegations levelled.

In compliance with the directive of PW 2, the witness had handed over a written complaint to the

CIABOC on 15/2/2018. Subsequently, witness Nagarajahs complaint had been reduced into writing

on 22/2/2018 by IP/ Tennakoon (PW 5) of CIABOC.

After making the statement to CIABOC on 22.02.2018, the witness met the second Accused-

Appellant at his office at Timber Corporation on 23/2/2018. During this meeting, the witness

conveyed the message to the second Accused-Appellant, that he wants to proceed ahead with the

Kanthale Sugar Factory project and therefore willing to pay a bribe as per the request of the first

Accused-Appellant. It was the suggestion of the second Accused-Appellant at this meeting that the

witness must pay Rs. 350Mn for the scrap metal in the factory premises and pay Rs. 100Mn to the

first Accused-Appellant in addition. At the end of this meeting, it was agreed to have a further

discussion with the first Appellant to iron out the issues that existed over the implementation of the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 19 of 145 Shareholders Agreement. According to the witness, this conversation had been recorded with the

use of his mobile phone.

The witness had met with the first and the second Accused Appellants once again at the office of the

second Accused-Appellant at the Timber Corporation on 27/2/2018. According to the witness, the

reactions of the first Accused-Appellant towards him at the very beginning was very rude. The first

Accused-Appellant, according to the witness, had gone to the extent of saying that he will never

trust the witness and does not know whether he is using any recording device even at that point.

The second Accused-Appellant had intervened at this point in time to mediate on the situation and

the 1st Accused-Appellant had agreed to talk to the witness about the project. It was suggested by

the first Accused-Appellant that the witness should in writing express his willingness to purchase the

scrap metal as estimated and a bribe of Rs. 100Mn, out of which Rs. 20Mn is to be paid as an

advance with immediate effect.

Witness has testified, before the High Court at Bar, that he tried to negotiate to bring down the

bribe to Rs. 10Mn but failed. He says that the first Accused-Appellant was very specific that he

would not allow the project to proceed as long as he occupies the office of the Secretary if the

demanded amount of Rs. 100Mn is not paid. It was also stated by the witness that the second

Accused-Appellant had actively participated throughout this discussion. This conversation on

27/2/2018 had also been recorded by the witness. After the said meeting the witness had to go to

India for a short stay.

It was asserted by the witness that he contacted the second Accused-Appellant whilst he was in

India and tried to negotiate the amount of bribe but the request was turned down by him saying

that the first Accused-Appellant would not agree to such a move.

Upon arrival on 05.03.2018, the witness had met the 2nd Accused-Appellant on two occasions, once

at Waters Edge and the other at the 2nd Accused-Appellants office. Even though the witness had

expected to arrange the transaction in early march, that did not materialize due to the retirement of

the 1st Accused-Appellant as Secretary Ministry of Lands and his assumption of duties as the Chief of

Staff to His Excellency the President.

However, witness Nagarajah had met the two Accused-Appellants at the Bread Talk Restaurant on

28/04/2018 around 11.30 a.m. after the 1st Accused-Appellant assumed duties as the Chief of staff to

His Excellency the President. According to the witness, this meeting was arranged as promised by

the 2nd Accused-Appellant. It is during this meeting the 1st Accused-Appellant had given his new

visiting card (P10) as the chief of staff to His Excellency the President. Witness had stated that, upon

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 20 of 145 his agreement to pay the demanded gratification of Rs. 100 million and to pay Rs. 20 million in

advance, the 1st Accused-Appellant agreed to provide his assistance to ensure the continuance of

the proposed Kanthale Sugar Factory project. Further, according to the witness he had requested

three days to organize things in order to meet the said advance of Rs. 20 million.

Two days after the above meeting, on 30/04/2018, the witness conveyed the message to the 2nd

Accused-Appellant that he is ready with the agreed advance money of Rs. 20 million by the 02nd or

3rd of May. By this time the witness had close contact with the officers of the CIABOC and he had

even provided a traveling bag to the investigators to bring the money. Sgt/ Karunarathne an officer

from CIABOC was entrusted as the decoy and this officer was present at Bread Talk when the

witness met the two Accused-Appellants on 28.04.2018. On the instructions of the investigators, it

was decided to conduct the raid at the Residence of witness Nagarajah and to introduce the decoy

as a domestic helper to the two Accused-Appellants when they visit his residence to accept the

bribe.

On the 3rd around 10 oclock witness received a call from the 2nd Accused-Appellant, that they should

be able to meet him after 2 p.m. at Hotel Taj Samudra. Once again, the 2nd Accused-Appellant had

called the witness around 11 oclock and told that both should be able to meet him around 3.20

p.m. at Hotel Taj Samudra.

According to witness Nagarajah, he immediately contacted the officers from CIABOC and informed

them of the change of venue and on the instructions, he received from the investigators, left for

Hotel Taj Samudra accompanied by Sgt/ Karunarathne in his car driven by his Driver.

Whilst the witness had been waiting at the coffee shop in the lobby of Hotel Taj Samudra, it was the

2nd Accused-Appellant who joined him first. A few minutes later, the 1st Accused-Appellant had also

come to the same place and had a conversation for about 50 minutes and had some beverages as

well. According to him, the 1st Accused-Appellant had questioned about the money and it was

informed to him that it is ready but kept with the personal assistant who is in the car at the car park.

It was further told by the witness that the 1st Accused-Appellant wanted another bag and that was

supplied with the assistance of a waiter at the coffee shop. Upon settling the bill, (P16) all three

proceeded towards the car park through the rear passage of the Hotel. When they reached the

driveway, the witness waved at his driver with the use of the bag collected from the coffee shop

(P17) signaling him to come towards them. Sgt. Karunaratne having seen this signal got off from the

car and walked towards the witness and the two Accused-Appellants carrying, the red colour

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 21 of 145 traveling bag which contained Rs. 20 million cash. By the time Sgt/Karunaratne reached the trio, the

car also reached closer to them.

According to the virtual complainant, when he asked the 1st Accused-Appellant whether he can

hand over the bag, he was told by the 1st Accused-Appellant that he wants to check the money and

give the 2nd Accused-Appellants portion. Thereafter the 1st Accused-Appellant got into the rear seat

of the car from the drivers side.

The Prosecution claims that P12 was then handed over to the 1st Appellant who was seated in the

back seat and told: Doctor I did my part and I need your help to continue with the Kanthale

Project. Since the 1st Accused-Appellant was struggling to open the bag, the witness had requested

Sgt/ Karunarthne to assist the 1st Accused-Appellant to get it open. The decoy, Sgt/ Karunarathne

had helped the 1st Accused-Appellant to check the cash bundles and thereafter put three bundles

out of four, into the bag that was obtained from the coffee shop, by Sgt/ Karaunarathne on the

request of the 1st Accused-Appellant. This paper bag which was produced marked P-17 was with the

witness until the 1st Accused-Appellant wanted that bag to be given to Sgt/ Karunarathne to put the

3 cash bundles into the bag. The 2nd Accused-Appellant had been standing at the front passenger

seat door during this time.

Witness saw the officers from the CIABOC approaching his car and arresting the two Accused-

Appellants, whilst the money that was given to the 1st Accused-Appellant was in his custody.

According to witness Nagarajah, he made a statement to CIABOC on the following day regarding the

raid which took place at Hotel Taj Samudra. The investigators had requested him to hand over the

two mobile phones that he used to record the conversations with the 1st and 2nd Accused-

Appellants, but he has declined to adhere to the said request on the basis that his personal mobile

phone contained a lot of financial, personal and health details of him and his family.

The prosecution had relied on the evidence of several officers from CIABOC in establishing the case

against the two Accused before the High Court at Bar and Sgt/ Karunarathne who acted as the decoy

is one of the main witnesses the prosecution had relied upon.

According to the evidence of Sgt/ Karunarathne, he witnessed the meeting between Nagarajah and

the two Accused-Appellants which took place at the Bread Talk Restaurant on 28.04.2018.

Thereafter he was instructed to act as a domestic helper at the house of witness Nagarajah when it

was arranged to hand over the bribe money to the Accused-Appellants. The said plan was suddenly

changed and the witness was instructed to go to Hotel Taj Samudra with the bag containing Rs.

2000000/-. He went to Hotel Taj Samudra accompanied by witness Nagarajah in the car belonging to

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 22 of 145 the witness Nagarajah driven by Nagarajahs driver. He was instructed to be in the car park and to

meet witness Nagarajah with the bag containing the money when the message was sent by witness

Nagarajah who went inside the Hotel. According to the witness, both the witness and the

Complainant Nagarajah were searched by CI/ Pushpakumara before they left the house of the

complainant at Rosemond Place. After some time, the driver informed him that witness Nagarajah

wanted him to come with the money. At that time, he saw Nagarajah coming towards the car park

with two others and waving at them. He immediately got down from the car with the Red colour

bag and walked towards them. The car too was moved towards them and stopped Infront of them.

At that time, he heard the witness asking the others, whether he could give the money and the 1st

Accused-Appellant saying that he wanted to get inside the car and check the money.

When the 1st Accused-Appellant got into the rear seat of the car, Nagarajah had given him the bag

and the 1st Accused-Appellant tried to open the bag. At that stage he heard Complainant Nagarajah

telling the 1st Accused-Appellant, Dr. I have done my part, I wanted you to help me to start the

sugar project On the request of Nagarajah, the witness helped 1st Accused-Appellant to open the

bag and on the request of the 1st Accused-Appellant witness put 3 bundles of money (out of four)

into a bag which was given to him by Complainant Nagarajah (P-17)

After placing three bundles of cash in P17 upon the request of the 1st Accused-Appellant, Sgt/

Karunarathne signaled SI/ Weerathunge (PW06), who was close by, indicating the completion of the

transaction.

With the said signal of Sgt/ Karunarathne, all the key members of the investigating team, CI/

Pushpakumara (PW03), IP/ Tennakoon (PW05), and SI/ Weerathunga (PW06), who were

approaching the car, had rushed there. Witness then informed the Chief Investigating Officer and

others that the person who is in the back seat is the 1st Accused-Appellant and the person who is

standing near the front passenger seat is the 2nd Accused-Appellant. He had confirmed the

completion of the transaction between the virtual complainant and the 1st Accused-Appellant. It is

CI/ Pushpakumaras evidence that the 2nd Accused-Appellant at this point asked whether they are

police Officers and the 1st Accused-Appellant had told he is the Chief of Staff to His Excellency the

President. CI/ Pushpakumara, has informed him that he is aware of that and requested the 1st

Accused Appellant to allow him to continue his duties.

Regarding the investigation carried out by the officers of CIABOC, witness Thushara Ruwan Kumara

Superintendent of Police and IP Janaka Pushpakumara gave evidence before the High Court at Bar

and witness Anura Tennakoon, Inspector of Police, S.K. Weerathunga, Sub-Inspector of Police and

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 23 of 145 IP/ Janaka Pushpakumara gave evidence about the raid conducted on 03.05.2013 at Hotel Taj

Samudra.

As revealed from the evidence of the said witnesses, upon his return from India on 05.03.2018, the

Virtual Complainant Nagarajah informed the investigators that there is a great possibility for the

transaction to take place either on 8th or 9th March 2018.

Thereafter ASP/ Ruwan Kumara (PW 2) assigned the investigation to a team led by Chief Inspector

Pushpakumara (PW 3). CI/ Pushpakumara had been instructed by ASP/ Ruwan Kumara to obtain Rs.

30Mn cash from the Central Bank with the assistance of the Accounts Division. ASP/Ruwan Kumara

has stated in his evidence that he decided to obtain Rs. 30Mn, instead of the required amount of Rs.

20Mn simply to avoid any suspicion, had the request of CIABOC being leaked to the suspects.

The investigators had initially suspected that the transaction might take place at the office of the

second Accused-Appellant in the Timber Corporation. They had in fact visited the said compound in

order to get ready for the raid, in case it takes place in that compound. At the same time, the

Investigating Officers had come to the residence of the virtual complainant at Rosemond Place and

had been of the view that it is a better location to have the raid conducted, having been compared

to the surroundings of the Timber Corporation.

The case for the Prosecution is that, even though the Investigators were ready to conduct the raid

on 8th or 9th March 2018, it did not materialize due to Mr. Nagarajah being informed by the second

Accused-Appellant that the first Accused-Appellant is to retire as Secretary, Ministry of Lands and to

assume duties as the Chief of Staff to His Excellency the President. However, after the meeting with

the two Accused-Appellants and the Complainant at Bread Talk Restaurant on 28.04.2018,

Complainant Nagarajah informed the Investigators that the transaction might take place within two-

three days.

The Investigating team comprised CI/Pushpakumara (PW03), IP/Tennakoon (PW05), SI/

Weerathunga (PW06), and Sgt/Karunaratne (PW07) had visited the residence of Nagarajah on

02/05/2018 and decided at that point that it would be practically convenient for them to conduct

the raid if it takes place at his residence.

It was decided at this meeting to have Sgt/ Karunarathne as the decoy when the raid is conducted.

The team of investigators had once again visited the residence on 03/05/2018, the following day, to

conduct the raid according to the instructions and directions that they are going to receive from the

2nd Accused-Appellant simply because the via media between Complainant and the 1st Accused-

Appellant was the 2nd Accused-Appellant. It was at this visit only CI/ Pushpakumara had brought Rs.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 24 of 145 20 million out of the money obtained by the CIABOC in March in anticipation of this raid, to the

residence of witness Nagarajah and showed the same to him, four bundles of Rs. 5000 notes (P14-a,

b, c, d), a total sum of Rs. 20million.

It is also claimed both by the virtual complainant and the investigating officers that the virtual

complainant was adequately cautioned that he should not at any point give the money to the

suspects forcefully and must give it to the hand of the suspect only if he shows a willingness to

accept the money, whilst stressing that the money is being given to him in order to facilitate the

Kanthale Sugar Factory project. The decoy Sgt/ Karunarathne too was present when the said

instructions were given to the Complainant.

On 03rd May a red colour traveling bag (P 12) had been obtained by the investigators from the

Virtual Complainant in order to put the said four bundles of money. Before the bundles of money

had been kept inside P 12, they were wrapped using a few pages of an English newspaper (P 13).

The cash certificate in respect of the said amount of money had been submitted by the CIABOC at

the time suspects were produced before the Magistrate upon arrest (P 15).

Once the venue had been informed by the 2nd Accused-Appellant, CI/ Pushpakumara had decided to

send the supporting teams along with IP/Tennakoon (PW 05), SI/ Weerathunga and

WSI/Weerasinghe to Hotel Taj Samudra for reconnaissance/or to gather useful information in the

ground level to conduct the raid.

Upon receiving the 2nd call specifying the time and confirming the venue, the Investigators who

remained at the Complainants residence had advised him to leave for Hotel Taj Samudra and the

Complainant had left for the Hotel, accompanied by Sgt/Karunarathne (PW 07) in his Chauffer

driven car.

Complainant Nagarajah had once again been strictly advised not to coerce or not to forcefully get

the money accepted. The presence of the decoy at the time of the transaction had also been

stressed upon. The decoy and the complainant were both searched by CI/ Pushpakumara and got

himself satisfied that there is nothing illegal in their possession.

CI/ Pushkumara had left Nagarajahs residence at the same time in his official car to Hotel Taj

Samudra.

According to the evidence of CI/ Pushpakumara when he went to Hotel Taj Samudra, the other

CIABOC officer including IP/ Tennakoon, SI/ Weerathunge and WSI/ Weerasinghe had already

arrived at the Hotel. He had seen the car belonging to the Complaint parked at the car park and he

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 25 of 145 too has stayed in the car park area. After some time, he saw the Complainant coming towards the

car park with two other persons and Sgt/ Karunarathne going towards them with the Red Bag. The

car belonging to the Complainant had moved towards them. When he saw PS Karunarathnes signal,

he rushed towards the car.

At that time CI/Pushpakumara had witnessed the red colour traveling bag (P12) on the back seat

beside 1st Accused-Appellant, CI/ Pushpakumara had further noticed that the three sealed bundles

of cash were inside the Taj Samudra paper bag, (P17) and the unsealed bundle of cash was inside

the red colour traveling bag (P12). Thereafter CI/ Pushpakumara put three sealed bundles of cash

and the Taj Samudra paper bag inside the red colour traveling bag and handed over the same to

SI/Weerathunga (PW06).

The 1st Accused-Appellant had been arrested around 4.35 p.m. followed by the arrest of the 2nd

Accused-Appellant and both were taken to CIABOC to record their statements.

During the investigation at Hotel Taj Samudra, it has also been revealed that the Toyota Allion car

bearing number KF- 9502, which belongs to the presidential secretariat, which was used by the 1st

Accused-Appellant on 03.05.2018 to come to Hotel Samudra had been parked at the car park in

anticipation of the return of the 1st Accused-Appellant. PW 10, Pinsiri Dharmapriya Peiris, the driver

of the said vehicle had been arrested soon after the arrest of the two Accused-Appellants whilst

waiting at the hotel car park, but released soon afterward his statement was recorded. Peiris has

testified before the High Court at Bar to the effect that he was advised by the 1st Accused-Appellant

to wait at the car park of the hotel until his return.

In addition to the evidence of the virtual Complainant and the Police Witnesses, the evidence of the

Government Analyst played an important role in the prosecution evidence before the High Court at

Bar. The prosecution had placed a lot of reliance on the telephone conversations between the

virtual Complainant and the Accused-Appellants. As already referred to above in this Judgment, the

virtual Complainant in his evidence before the High Court at Bar referred to several instances where

he has recorded the conversation he had with the two Accused-Appellants. In the said

circumstances voice identification of the two Accused-Appellants and the recorded conversations

between the virtual Complainant and the Accused-Appellants had a key role to play at the trial

before the High Court at Bar, and in this regard, the prosecution heavily relied on the evidence of

Ms. Dulani Lalithya Gunathilake, an Assistant Examiner of Questioned Documents attached to the

Government Analyst Department (PW41)

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 26 of 145 Witness Gunathilake had been called by the prosecution in order to testify about 18 voice samples

she had extracted from two telephones belonging to the virtual Complainant that was handed over

to her on 17.05.2018. The two Accused-Appellants had been produced before the witness to obtain

voice samples on 29.06.2018 by an order of the Chief Magistrate.

The two Accused-Appellants raised several objections regarding the admissibility of the said

evidence during the trial before the High Court at Bar, and several legal issues were raised before us

during their submissions. We will be separately analyzing the questions of law raised on behalf of

the two Accused-Appellants and will be considering the evidence of witness Gunathilake when

analyzing the above.

The contemporaneous recordings of CCTV footage at Bread Talk Restaurant and Hotel Taj Samudra

were also another piece of evidence relied upon by the prosecution. The above footages were

played before this Court as well as before the High Court at Bar by the prosecution.

Apart from the evidence of the above witnesses, the prosecution had relied on the evidence of a

few formal witnesses in order to establish some legal requirements and their evidence was neither

challenged nor discussed on behalf of the two Accused-Appellants before this Court. At the

conclusion of the trial before the High Court at Bar, Court having considered the material placed

before it had called upon the two Accused-Appellants to place their defence before Court.

The 1st Accused-Appellant had made a statement from the dock and the 2nd Accused-Appellant

opted to give evidence from the witness box. Witness Neelakandan was called as a witness on

behalf of the second Accused Appellant. In his dock statement, the 1st Accused-Appellant admitted

that he was appointed the secretary to the Ministry of Lands in 2015 and continued to hold the

office until 10.03.2018, since his retirement from the public service. He had then been appointed as

the Chief of Staff to His Excellency the President with effect from 22.03.2018, though the letter of

appointment received by him on 05.04.2018.

According to the 1st Accused-Appellant he had been in the public service for over 30 years at the

time he was arrested in relation to this incident. He vehemently denied the allegation levelled

against him and went on to say that he follows a very simple lifestyle that was never tainted with

bribes or any improper/ immoral conduct. He claimed that he was trapped by the complainant and

that the CIABOC offices may have simply resorted to their ordinary duties.

Nevertheless, the 1st Accused-Appellant admitted that he met the complainant somewhere in

August 2016, soon after the Shareholders Agreement was signed on 11.08.2016, at his office, on

27.02.2018 at the office of the 2nd Accused-Appellant in Timber Cooperation, on 28.04.2018 at

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 27 of 145 Bread Talk Restaurant and on 03.05.2018 at hotel Taj Samudra. He also admitted that the 2nd

Accused-Appellant accompanied him during the last 3 meetings above mentioned, at Timber

Cooperation, at Bread Talk Restaurant, and at hotel Taj Samudra.

The concern of the 1st Accused-Appellant regarding the project in issue seems to be his observation

on the Complainant/ Investor that he is more interested in the scrap metal available in the

compound of the factory than in commencing the substantive Sugar Cane project. The 1st Accused-

Appellant has stated that he, during the meeting on 27.02.2018, advised the Complainant that he

could pay Rs.350 million for the value of the infrastructure available in the premises and commence

the Sugar Cane project.

The 1st Accused-Appellant admits the pending Arbitration process in Singapore and submitted to the

court that he was supposed to be a witness on behalf of the Sri Lankan Government and the

Attorney Generals Department was getting ready by preparing his affidavit before he testified. The

1st Accused-Appellant had not been able to testify as scheduled due to the arrest of this case and he

has revealed that the Sri Lankan Government had lost the said arbitration in November 2018.

Whilst claiming that the Complainant developed a rift with him during this period of the delays in

implementing the Kanthale Sugar project, the 1st Accused-Appellant admits that he took part in the

discussions and the meetings with the complainant because of the request by the 2nd Accused-

Appellant, who is a long-standing friend of him.

Explaining the events which took place on 03.05.2018, the 1st Accused-Appellant says that he was

thinking of getting a lift from the complainant to the Ministry of Postal Services, where his wife was

the secretary, got into the complainants car to the right-hand rear seat. He had then been thinking,

according to the 1st Accused-Appellant, to call his driver who was waiting for him at the hotel car

park, to go back to the office, but suddenly a few people claimed to be police officers from CIABOC,

had approached him and arrested then and there.

He claims that he in fact was a victim of a very well-articulated and executed conspiracy to trap him

due to the role he played as the secretary to the Ministry of Lands. He further claims that the voice

recordings produced in court are fabricated.

As referred to above the 2nd Accused-Appellant had opted to give evidence from the witness box

and he had been subjected to cross-examined by the prosecution.

The career of the 2nd Accused-Appellant in the public sector runs from 1978 to 2015. He himself had

been the Chief of Staff to a former president when such a position was created for the first time.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 28 of 145 Upon his retirement, in 2015, he had been appointed the Chairman of the State Timber

Cooperation, which also falls within the ambit of a public officer in terms of the bribery act. He

had been holding the said office until he was arrested on 03.05.2018 in relation to this matter. The

2nd Accused-Appellant claimed that he met the complainant at a public function well before the

meeting at Waters Edge Restaurant on 09.05.2017. Whilst admitting the first meeting reflected in

the indictment, at Waters Edge Restaurant on 09.05.2017, the 2nd Accused Appellant admits the

next four meetings he was alleged to have taken part, on 23.02.2018 and 27.02.2018 at his office,

28.04.2018 at Bread Talk Restaurant and finally on 03.05.2018 at hotel Taj Samudra.

The assertion of the virtual Complainant that the first Accused-Appellant blamed him for trying to

trap him is corroborated by the 2nd Accused-Appellant to a greater extent. He claims that after the

initial exchange of words commenced by the 1st Accused Appellant, both of them had ironed out

their differences and agreed to work together.

The 2nd Accused-Appellant speaks of a herbal toothpaste, requested to be brought from India when

the complainant goes there. And also, he had stated that the complainant had indicated to him that

he has brought a bottle of Brandy when returning from overseas and one of the expectations of the

2nd Accused-Appellant during the meeting at Bread Talk was to obtain the said two items.

Apparently, he admits that he was given the said herbal toothpaste by the complainant when they

met at the Bread Talk Restaurant, but not the bottle of Brandy.

Explaining the reasons for his presence at hotel Taj Samudra on 03.05.2018, the 2nd Accused-

Appellant says that he had to participate in a meeting in the India-Sri Lanka summit in the same

evening at the same venue and therefore he thought of accommodating the repeated requests of

the Complainant to have a meeting with the presence of the 1st Accused-Appellant.

It is the version of the 2nd Accused-Appellant that after the three of them met at the lobby of Hotel

Taj Samudra for a discussion for about 20 minutes, the virtual Complainant had informed them that

the two bottles of Brandy brought for them are in the car. According to the 1st Accused Appellant,

the reason for him and the 1st Accused-Appellant to proceed towards the car park of the hotel was

to get the said bottles. He confirmed the virtual Complainant getting a bag from the waiter of the

hotel restaurant and says that he thought it was meant for the bottles the virtual Complainant was

to give them.

The 2nd Accused-Appellant confirmed that the car of the virtual Complainant approached three of

them when they proceeded towards the car park and a person with a pink colored t-shirt put a red

colored bag on the rear seat of the car after opening the back door. He has testified that either time

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 29 of 145 he realized that the said red bag did not contain the anticipated bottles of Brandy, the 1st Accused-

Appellant had already got into the back seat of the car from the drivers side. He admits that he too

had been leaning onto the car when the investigators surrounded the car.

The 2nd Accused-Appellant vehemently denied that he himself solicited or abetted the 1st Accused-

Appellant to solicit and/or accept any bribe from the Complainant in relation to any of the official

duties related to Kanthale Sugar Project. Further, at one point, he denied the presence of his voice

in the produced audio recording in court and alleged that the said recordings are being tampered

with by the Complainant.

It is on the strength of the above evidence placed before the High Court at Bar, Court proceeded to

convict the two Accused-Appellants on charges levelled against them except for the 3rd Count

framed against the 2nd Accused-Appellant. It is also important to note at this stage that the

prosecution after leading evidence before the High Court at Bar had informed Court that the

prosecution would not be proceeding against the 2nd Accused-Appellant with regard to the 3rd count

framed against the 2nd Accused-Appellant.

In the light of the evidence placed before the High Court at Bar by the prosecution as well as by the

two Accused-Appellants, this Court will now proceed to consider the questions of Law raised by the

two Accused-Appellants before this Court.

Was the investigation into the complaint received by the CIABOC against the Appellants,

conducted by officers of the CIABOC in a lawful manner? (Was the investigation lawful?)

The argument advanced by the Accused-Appellants is that the officers of the CIABOC had not carried

out investigations into the complaint received by it against the two Accused-Appellants, in a lawful

manner. It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Accused Appellants that

the first complaint regarding this incident was not lawfully recorded by the officers of the CIABOC. In

order to evaluate this argument, let us first consider the process in which the virtual complainant

Nagarajah, approached the CIABOC.

As already observed in this Judgment the virtual complainant had met ASP Ruwan Kumara of

CIABOC following the phone call, he received in his office at CIABOC where ASP Ruwan Kumara had

advised him to write a complaint regarding the matter. Thus, ASP Ruwan Kumara after listening to

the oral account narrated by the virtual complaint, sent the virtual complainant back to submit a

written complaint, without proceeding to record/reduce the statement into writing at that time

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 30 of 145 itself. It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that this procedure is illegal as it is

contrary to section 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979.

Thereafter, the virtual complainant proceeded to lodge a complaint on 15th February 2018 acting

upon which, CIABOC had proceeded to record a statement from him in the English language on 22

February 2018. The investigators then informed him that the available material is not sufficient to

proceed with an arrest, to which the virtual complainant responded that he no longer had contact

with either Appellant at that point in time. The Investigators had then instructed the virtual

complainant to regenerate communication with the Appellants. It is this procedure that the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Accused Appellants complains as being unlawful.

Section 109 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 on which the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Accused Appellants have relied, states as follows;

Every information relating to the commission of an offence may be given orally or in

writing to a police officer or inquirer

Section 109 (2) states-

If such information is given orally to a police officer or to an inquirer, it shall be reduced to

writing by him in the language in which it is given and be read over to the informant:

Provided that if it is not possible for the officer or inquirer to record the information in the

language in which it is given the officer or enquirer shall request that the information be

given in writing. If the informant is unable to give it in writing, the officer or inquirer shall

record the information in one of the national languages after recording the reasons for doing

so and shall read over the record to the informant or interpret it in the language he

understands.

However, we observe that the procedure regarding the commencement of an investigation in

relation to the offences under the Bribery Act by CIABOC is different. The Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994 (CIABOC Act) has specifically provided as to

how CIABOC must commence an investigation. This can be clearly seen in sections 3, 4, and 5 of the

Act. It is worthwhile reproducing the following parts from those sections.

CIABOC Act No. 19 of 1994

Section 3

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 31 of 145

The Commission shall subject to the other provisions of this Act, investigate allegations,

contained in communications made to it under section 4 and where any such

investigation discloses the commission of any offence by any person under the Bribery

Act or the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, No. 1 of 1975, direct the institution

of proceedings against such person for such offence in the appropriate court.

Section 4

(1) An allegation of bribery or corruption may be made against a person (whether or

not such person is holding on the date on which the communication is received by the

Commission, the office, or employment by virtue of holding which he is alleged to have

committed the act constituting bribery or corruption) by a communication to the

Commission, or a person may by a communication on to the Commission, draw the

attention of the Commission to any recent acquisitions of wealth or property or to any

recent financial or business dealings or to any recent expenditures by a person (whether

or not such person is holding any office or employment on the date on which such

communication is received by the Commission) which acquisitions, dealings or

expenditures are to the knowledge of the person making such communication not

commensurate with the known sources of wealth or income of such person.

(2) Upon receipt of a communication under subsection (1) the Commission, if it is

satisfied that such communication is genuine and that the communication discloses

material upon which an investigation ought to be conducted, shall conduct such

investigation as may be necessary for the purpose of deciding upon all or any of the

following matters; -

(a) prosecution or other suitable action under the provisions of the Bribery Act or the

Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, No. 1 of 1975; or

(b) prosecution under any other Law.

and where the Commission decides, whether before or after the conduct of an

investigation, that a communication received by it should be dealt with by any other

authority, it may forward such communication to such other authority.

(3) the Commission shall have the power to investigate any matters disclosed by a

communication received by it under subsection (1) whether or not such matters relate

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 32 of 145

to a period prior to the appointed date and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

any other law.

Thus, it is a legal obligation in the form of a prerequisite under the CIABOC Act that the Commission

must be satisfied that any communication it receives, is genuine and that such communication

discloses material upon which an investigation ought to be conducted. Therefore, it would not be

lawful for the Commission to bypass this provision and straight away proceed to launch an

investigation in respect of any communication it receives irrespective of its merits.

Let us also consider the applicability of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15

of 1979 to the investigations undertaken by CIABOC.

Section 2 (1) of the Bribery Act No. 11 of 1954 has clearly set out the scope of application of other

written laws to the offences under the Bribery Act. It is as follows;

Section 2 (2) of the Bribery Act-

(2) Where the provisions of this Act are in conflict or are inconsistent with any other

written law, this Act shall prevail.

Further, Section 6(1) of the Bribery Act also has clearly specified the application of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 to the offences under the Bribery Act in the following

manner.

Section 6 (1) of the Bribery Act-

(1) Such of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979, as are

not excluded by subsection (2) or are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act shall

apply to proceedings instituted in a court for offences under this Act.

In addition, the Prosecutions 2nd witness ASP Ruwan Kumara has provided the reasoning behind

what impelled him not to record the virtual Complainants statement at the very first instance, but

to advise him to provide a written statement as CIABOC could treat it as a communication upon

which it could act. Alongside other reasons, ASP Ruwan Kumara has stated in his evidence that as

there was a complexity in the complaint and uncertainty in the alleged solicitation of a gratification

at that point in time, he had wanted to establish whether the virtual Complainant was consistent in

his version and ascertain whether there was merit in the allegations put forward by the virtual

complainant.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 33 of 145 In the evidence given by the virtual Complainant (PW 1), the learned counsel of the 2nd Appellant

highlights that there was no evidence of contact between 2nd Appellant and the virtual Complainant

after 5th September 2017, until the 23rd of February 2018, the day after Ruwan Kumara initiated the

instigation on 22nd February 2018. Further, the learned counsel for the 2nd Appellant submitted that

the entire process by CIABOC was to instigate, induce and inveigle PW 1 to hand over a bribe by

providing PW 1 with the money to do so and that was a plan formulated by PW 2 Ruwan Kumara to

entrap the Accused Appellants.

Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellants persistently submitted that the Investigators of the

CIABOC had an ulterior motive to entrap the Accused-Appellants, claiming that ASP Ruwan Kumara

had made an unjustified phone call to the virtual Complainant instructing him to come to the

CIABOC, without waiting for the virtual Complainant to come on his own. However, the evidence

given by ASP Ruwan Kumara has clarified that the Director/Investigations of the CIABOC has

informed him about the virtual Complainant and asked him to contact the said foreign national. The

witness has further explained how they ordinarily receive complaints and has explained the

situations where third parties contact the CIABOC on behalf of the Complainants [p.953 Vol 4A of

Appeal Brief].

It is the submission of the appellants that the virtual Complainant had no intention of making a

complaint to CIABOC. It is on that footing that the appellants further submitted that there cannot be

a valid conviction without a legal and fair investigation.

We need to be mindful that the offences of bribery and corruption is generally committed by public

officers. Thus, for an instance, in a circumstance where an allegation of bribery has to be made

against the officer in charge of a police station, the mechanism provided for in the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act for a complainant to make a complaint against the very police officer in the relevant

police station appears to cause practical difficulties.

On the other hand, as a person can easily make an allegation of Bribery against any public officer,

the legislature has set up a threshold in section 4 (2) of the CIABOC Act in that it has required

CIABOC to be satisfied that the information received by it, is genuine and warrants further

investigation. That would explain why investigations for the offences under the Bribery Act must

proceed on a somewhat different path.

Thus, the legislature in its wisdom has vested the CIABOC with the power of commencing an

investigation against any public officer when it receives any such communication only when the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 34 of 145 Commission is satisfied that such communication is genuine and discloses material upon which an

investigation ought to be conducted.

It must also be noted that the 19th amendment to the Constitution which was certified by the

Parliament on 15th May 2015 brought in Chapter XIX A introducing a new Article, i.e., Article 156 A.

According to Article 156A (1) (b), the powers of CIABOC includes the power to direct the holding of a

preliminary inquiry or the making of an investigation into an allegation of bribery or corruption,

whether of its own motion or on a complaint made to it, and the power to institute prosecutions for

offences under the law in force relating to bribery or corruption. (Emphasize is ours)

Accordingly, it is clear that the 19th amendment to the Constitution by Article 156 A had empowered

the CIABOC to hold preliminary inquiries or investigations into allegations of bribery or corruption

on its own motion also. This is in addition to its power to act when a complaint is made by any

person.

We may mention here further that, the aforementioned Chapter (Chapter XIX A) containing Article

156 A was repealed by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution which came into effect on 29th

October 2020. Although the said provision was subsequently repealed, the incidents relating to the

instant case had taken place while the 19th amendment to the Constitution was in force i.e., the

alleged incidents of solicitation of gratification had occurred during the time period between 11th

August 20163rd May 2018. Thus, steps taken by ASP/Ruwan Kumara of CIABOC towards the

commencement of around 22nd February 2018 would fall under Article 156 A making it lawful under

the said article only.

Thus, it can be clearly seen that CIABOC had all the power, at the time in question, to commence

and proceed with any investigation even on its own motion i.e., without a complaint. In this regard,

section 5 of the CIABOC Act would also be relevant and its reproduction would further resolve the

above issues. It is as follows;

Section 5 of the CIABOC Act:

(1) For the purpose of discharging the functions assigned to it by this Act, the

Commission shall have the power-

(a) to procure and receive all such evidence, written or oral, and to examine all such

persons as the Commission may think necessary or desirable to procure, receive or

examine;

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 35 of 145

(b) to require any person to attend before the Commission for the purposes of being

examined by the Commission and to answer, orally on oath or affirmation, any question

put to him by the Commission relevant, in the opinion of the Commission, to the matters

under investigation or require such person to state any facts relevant to the matters

under investigation in the form of an affidavit;

(c) to summon any person to produce any document or other thing in his possession or

control;

(d) to direct by notice in writing the manager of any back produce, within such time as

may be specified in the notice, any book, document or cheque of the back containing

entries relating to the account of any person in respect of whom a communication has

been received under section 4 or of the spouse or a son or daughter of such person, or of

a company of which such person is a director, or of a trust in which such person has a

beneficial interest or of a firm of which such person is a partner, or to furnish as so

specified, certified copies of such book, document, cheque or of any entry therein;

(e) to direct by notice in writing the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue to furnish,

as specified in the notice, all information available to such Commissioner-General

relating to the affairs of any person in respect of whom a communication has been

received under section 4 or of the spouse or a son or daughter of such person and to

produce or furnish, as specified in the notice, any document or a certified copy of any

document relating to such person, spouse, son or daughter which is in the possession or

under the control of such Commissioner-General;

(f) to direct by notice in writing the person in charge of any department, office or

establishment of the Government or the Mayor, Chairman, Governor or chief executive,

howsoever designated, of a local authority, Provincial Council, scheduled institution or a

company in which the Government owns more than fifty per centum of the shares, to

produce or furnish, as specified in the notice, any book, register, record or document

which is in his possession or under his control or certified copies thereof or of any entry

therein;

(g) to direct any person in respect of whom communication has been received under

section 4 to furnish a sworn statement in writing-

(i) setting out all movable or immovable property owned or possessed at any time, or

at such time as may be specified by the Commission, by such person and by the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 36 of 145

spouse, son, or daughter of such person and specifying the date on which each of the

properties so set out was acquired, whether by way of purchase, gift, bequest,

inheritance or otherwise;

(ii) containing particulars of such other matters which in the opinion of the

Commission are relevant to the investigation;

(h) to direct any other person to furnish a sworn statement in writing-

(i) setting out all movable or immovable property owned or possessed at any time or

at such time as may be specified by the Commission, by a such person where the

Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that such information can assist an

investigation conducted by the Commission;

(ii) containing particulars of such other matters which in the opinion of the

Commission are relevant to the investigation;

(i) to prohibit, by written order, any person in respect of whom a communication

has been received under Section 4, the spouse, a son or daughter of such person,

or any other person holding any property in trust for such first-mentioned person,

or a company of which he is a director or firm in which he is a partner from

transferring the ownership of, or any interest in, any movable or immovable

property specified in such order, until such time as such order is revoked by the

Commission; and to cause a copy of such written order to be served on any such

authority as the Commission may think fit, including in the case of immovable

property, the Registrar of Lands, in the case of a motor vehicle, the Commissioner

of Motor Traffic and in the case of shares, stocks of debentures of any company,

the Registrar of Companies and the Secretary of such company;

(j) to require, by written order, any authority on whom a copy of a written order made

under paragraph (i) has been served, to cause such copy to be registered or filed in any

register or record maintained by such authority.

(k) to require, by written order the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to impound

the passport and other travel documents of any person in respect of whom a

communication has been received under section 4, for such period not exceeding three

months as may be specified in such written order; and

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 37 of 145

(l) to require by written order, any police officer as shall be specified in that order,

whether by name or by office, to take all such steps as may be necessary to prevent the

departure from Sri Lanka of any person in respect of whom a communication has been

received under section 4 for such period not exceeding three months, as may be specified

in such order.

(2) the Commission may exercise any power conferred on it under subsection (1) and any

person to whom the Commission issues any direction in the exercise of such power shall

comply with such direction, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law.

The above section also clearly shows that the procedure of investigating offences under the Bribery

Act takes a different form, from that of a normal crime investigation under the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act. That is the law of the country.

In the above circumstances, the submission made on behalf of the Appellants that the virtual

complainant had no intention of initiating an investigation by the officers of CIABOC becomes

irrelevant.

Hence, we hold that the investigators of the CIABOC inclusive of ASP Ruwan Kumara have acted

within the parameters of the law and have not acted in any manner which brings their conduct into

question.

We need to highlight one other matter regarding the complaint that in the instant case. That is the

argument that this case has been fabricated by the CIABOC against the Appellants. The Accused-

Appellants were very senior Public Officers with long experience. They had held posts in the top

echelons of the Government at the time of their arrest. However, it is noteworthy that at no time

had they hitherto ever taken any step to make any complaint to any authority against any

investigator for fabricating false evidence to implicate them in this crime. They also had failed to

make any complaint against anyone in relation to any coercive act committed or unfair treatment

meted out to them at any time during the investigation. Thus, we can conclude safely that no such

fabrication had happened in the course of the raid and thereafter.

Hence, we hold that the position of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Accused-Appellants that

the Accused-Appellants were subjected to an unfair, vindictive, prejudicial, and partisan

investigation is completely unfounded.

In view of the threshold provision in section 4(2) of the CIABOC Act and also in view of the fact that

any authorized officer of CIABOC is duty-bound to follow the procedure set out in the CIABOC Act,

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 38 of 145 the submissions made on behalf of the Accused-Appellants that the failure to record a statement

from the virtual complainant on the very first day has led to an unfair investigation, also does not

have merit. This is because the law requires that the CIABOC officer commencing the investigation

must be satisfied of the genuineness of the complaint/allegation.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Accused-Appellant advanced another argument to the

effect that the prosecution had failed to make available to the accused, a copy of the first complaint.

According to the learned Presidents Counsel, the first complaint of this case is the letter written by

Nagarajah to the Prime Minister. He urged that we must apply the principles of fair trial enumerated

in the case of Wijepala vs Attorney General. [(2001) 1 Sri L.R. 46]

It would be relevant at this stage to reproduce here, Section 444 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act which is as follows;

Section 444 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 179

444. Accused person entitled to copy of first information

(1) Every inquirer or officer in charge of a police station shall issue to every accused person or

his attorney-at-law who applies for it a duly certified copy of the first information relating to

the commission of the offence with which he is charged and of any statement made by the

person against whom or in respect of whom the accused is alleged to have committed an

offence.

(2) In every proceeding under this Code the production of a certified copy of any information or

statement obtained under subsection (1) shall be prima facie evidence of the fact that such

information was given or that such statement was made to the inquirer or police officer by

whom it was recorded; and notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, it shall not be

necessary to call such inquirer or officer as a witness solely for the purpose of producing

such certified copy.

(3) In the course of a trial in a Magistrates Court, the Magistrate may, in the interests of justice,

make available to the accused or his attorney-at-law for perusal in open court the statement

recorded under Section 110 of any witness whose evidence is relied on by the prosecution in

support of the charge against the accused.

What the learned Presidents Counsel for the Accused-Appellants complain as being not made

available for them, is not the first information relating to the commission of the offence which an

inquirer or officer in charge of a police station has had in their custody (as per the above section).

What the above section makes every accused entitled to receive, is a duly certified copy of the first

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 39 of 145 information relating to the commission of the offence with which any inquirer or officer in charge of

a police station is charged. Any letter written by either Nagarajah or anybody else to the President

or to the Prime Minister of the country cannot be considered as the first information relating to the

commission of the offence given to any inquirer or officer in charge of a police station under section

444 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

The information which is treated as the first information as per our law is the first information

relating to the commission of the offence given to any inquirer or officer in charge of a police

station. Even in Wijepala vs Attorney General (2001) 1 Sri LR 46 - Mark Fernando J treated witness

named Senaratne's statement around 9.30 pm to hospital Police Post, as the first information.

On the other hand, Nagarajahs evidence on what he informed the President by that letter is the

fact that the 1st appellant had called for tenders by way of a Newspaper advertisement, regarding

the disposal of the factory building, machinery, and other infrastructure in the premises.

Moreover, the learned Presidents Counsel for the accused-appellants has also failed to show that

there is evidence adduced in the trial, establishing the fact that any information/complaint (be it the

first information or otherwise) pertaining to a solicitation of a gratification by either the appellants

or any other public officer has been made to the President or the Prime Minister of the country.

This means that the appellants have not established the actual availability/actually making of such a

complaint although they claim entitlement for it on the basis that it is the first information of the

instant case.

There is also no mention of the fact whether the Appellants had taken any step to move court or the

prosecution to give them a copy of this document if there was any such document available.

Therefore, this submission made by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellants has no merit.

The Indictment was ex facie ultra vires the provisions of section 11 of the CIABOC ACT

The next question of law raised on behalf of the 2nd Accused-Appellant was that the Indictment was

ex-facia ultra vires the provisions of Section 11 of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of 1994 (CIABOC Act) for the reason that the Indictment served on

the Accused-Appellant was unaccompanied by the direction of the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (the Commission) to institute proceedings against the Accused-

Appellants. The above issue was first raised before the High Court at Bar as a preliminary objection

by the Accused-Appellants and the High Court at Bar overruled the preliminary objection.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 40 of 145 There is no doubt as to the nature of the indictment that was before the High Court at Bar. CIABOC

had investigated a complaint of bribery and forwarded an Indictment against the two Accused under

the provisions of the Bribery Act. The jurisdictional objection that was first raised before the High

Court at Bar as well as before this Court on behalf of the 2nd Accused-Appellant was based on the

provisions of Section 11 of the CIABOC ACT.

When raising the objection, it was contended;

a) Whether the CIABOC had considered the investigational findings and directed the

Director General of CIABOC to institute Criminal proceedings against the Appellant

before the High Court.

b) If such a directive had been issued, was it incumbent on the Director General of CIABOC

to have attached to the indictment, the direction received by him by the Commissioners?

and the learned Presidents Counsel heavily relied on two Appellate Court decisions one by

the Court of Appeal and the other by the Supreme Court.

Even though this Court is not bound by a decision of the Court of Appeal, their lordships of the Court

of Appeal when deciding the case of Nandasena Gotabya Rajapakse V. Director General

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption and Others CA (Rev) APN

29/2018 C.A. minute 12.09.2019 had considered a plethora of decisions both by the SC as well as

Court of Appeal and therefore it appears to us that the said decision has a persuasive value before

the Supreme Court.

The main complaint in the said case was the failure by CIABOC to act under Section 78(1) of the

Bribery Act (as amended) by granting written sanction to institute the proceedings before the

Magistrates Court. The English Text of Section 78(1) of the Bribery Act (as amended) reads as

follows;

No Magistrates Court shall entertain any prosecution for an offence under this Act except

by or with the written sanction of the Commission.

The Court of Appeal has referred to the Sinhala text of Section 78 (1) of the Bribery Act, (as

amended) and also to the decision by the Supreme Court in Senanayake V. Attorney General (2010)

1 Sri LR 149 and observed the following;

The prosecution by the Commission is therefore clearly legislative residue from Section 78

(1) from the statutory provisions that existed before the amendment brought in by Act Nos.

19 and 20 of 1994, with no corresponding power conferred on the Commission to institute

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 41 of 145

proceedings. In the circumstances, the order of the Magistrates Court and the Provincial

High Court is tainted with illegality and thereby subjected to be interfered with this Court in

exerting its power of revision

The Court of Appeal has observed the above and had finally concluded that If that Court is the

Magistrates Court, then the Commission must sanction the institution of such proceedings by

written communication to that effect, addressed to that Court.

Even though section 78 (1) of the Bribery Act refers to a written sanction in order to entertain any

prosecution before the Magistrate, neither Section 78 (1) nor any other provision in the Bribery Act

had imposed a similar restriction when forwarding an indictment to the High Court. Since the

decision by the Court of Appeal had only considered the question of sanction granted by the

Commission under Section 78 (1) of the Bribery Act (as amended) we see no relevance of the

above judgment to the instant case.

The Petitioner in Anoma S. Polwatte V. Director General Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery and Corruption and Others SC Writ 1/2011 SC minute dated 26.07.2018, had challenged the

decision to prosecute the Petitioner before the Magistrates Court by way of a Writ Application.

In the said case Petitioners main argument before the Supreme Court was the failure of the CIABOC

to adhere to Section 11 of the CIABOC Act when forwarding charges before the Magistrates Court.

Section 11 of the CIABOC Act which provides for a directive from CIABOC to the Director General,

reads as follows;

Section 11 Where the material received by the Commission in the course of an investigation

conducted by it under this Act, discloses the commission of an offence by any person

under the Bribery Act or the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 01 of 1975,

the Commission shall direct the Director General to institute criminal proceedings

against such person in the appropriate Court and the Director General shall institute

proceedings accordingly.

When raising the said objection to the charges that were presented before the Magistrates Court,

the Petitioner had also relied on Section 2 (a) of the CIABOC Act which reads as follows;

Section 2 (a) The Commission shall consist of three members, two of whom shall be retired Judges

of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal and one of whom shall be a person with

wide experience relating to the Investigation of Crime and Law Enforcement.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 42 of 145 In the said case it was submitted before the Supreme Court, that during the period of which the

investigation with regard to the Petitioner was carried out, CIABOC was not properly constituted

since there were some unfilled positions or vacancies in the Commission and therefore the

Commission could not have given a directive to the Director General to institute proceedings against

the Petitioner before the Magistrates Court under Section 11 of the CIABOC Act. While responding

to the above position taken up by the Petitioner in the said case, the Director General of CIABOC

had submitted the journal entry of the relevant file which carried the directive received by him

before the Supreme Court along with the affidavit he tendered before the Court. The Supreme

Court has considered several provisions of the CIABOC Act and the journal entry that was produced

marked R-1, had finally concluded that there was no valid directive made under Section 11 of the

CIABOC Act and quashed the charge sheet issued to the Petitioner in the said case.

When raising the question of law, on behalf of the 2nd Accused-Appellant, it was submitted that the

said decision had imposed a duty cast upon the Director General to file the directive he received by

the Commission under Section 11 of the CIABOC Act along with the indictment filed before the High

Court.

As already referred to above, the Petitioner in the case of Anoma S. Polwatte V. Director General

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (supra) came before the Supreme

Court seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the charges served on her since there was no valid

directive given by the Commission under Section 11 of the CIABOC Act. The Petitioner in the said

Case had not challenged the charges served on her under Section 78 (1) of the Bribery Act (as

amended) even though the impugned charge sheet was filed before the Magistrates Court under

Section 78 (1) of the Bribery Act for the failure to submit the written sanction from the Commission,

and the Supreme Court when deciding the said case had not considered the provision in Section 78

(1) of the Bribery Act (as amended). It is also important to note at this stage that the Supreme Court

when deciding Anoma S. Polwatte V. Director General Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery and Corruption (supra) had not pronounced a requirement by the CIABOC to submit a

written directive when chargers are filed before the Magistrates Court.

The requirements that should be fulfilled by CIABOC when forwarding an indictment before the High

Court is identified under Section 12 (1) and (2) of the CIABOC Act which reads as follows;

Section 12 (1) Where proceedings are instituted in a High Court, in pursuance of a direction

made by the Commission under Section 11 by an indictment signed by the

Director General, such High Court shall receive such indictment and shall have

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 43 of 145

jurisdiction to try the offence described in such indictment in all respects as if

such indictment were an indictment presented by the Attorney General to

such Court.

(2) There shall be annexed to every such indictment, in addition to the

documents which are required by the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15

of 1979, to be annexed thereto, a copy of the statements, if any, before the

Commission, by the accused and by every person intended to be called as a

witness by the prosecution.

The said provisions, in Section 12 (1) and (2) are silent on any requirement to annex a copy of the

directive made under Section 11 of the CIABOC Act even though there is a specific reference to the

directive made by the Commission under Section 11 of the CIABOC Act in subsection (1) referred to

above.

In these circumstances it is clear that, the Supreme Court when deciding Anoma S. Polwatte V.

Director General Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (supra) had

never intended to impose an additional requirement to submit a written directive when filing

charges before Court, and therefore this Court is not inclined to impose an additional requirement

other than the provisions already identified in Section 12 (I) and (II) of the CIABOC Act when

forwarding an indictment before the High Court.

Whilst raising the above objection to the indictment before the Supreme Court, the learned

Presidents Counsel who represented the 2nd Accused-Appellant drew the attention of this Court to

the alleged fundamental errors committed by the High Court at Bar when refusing the same

jurisdictional objection at the commencement of the Trial at Bar proceeding.

In this regard it was submitted that the High Court at Bar erred;

a) In holding that this issue had to be canvassed in another forum by way of a separate

judicial proceeding

b) In deciding this issue by applying the presumption in Section 114, illustration (d) of

the Evidence Ordinance, failing to apply the explicit provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance, and totally disregarding the doctrine of stare Decisis, in not following the

decision of the Supreme Court in the Polwatte case.

c) In its selective application of presumptions under the Evidence Ordinance to the

detriment of the Accused,

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 44 of 145 When considering the submissions referred to above, it is clear that the said grounds of appeal

raised on behalf of the 2nd Accused-Appellant were based on a misinterpretation given to the

decision of this Court in the case of Anoma S. Polwatte V. Director General Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (supra).

As already observed by us, when deciding the above case, this Court had never intended to impose

an additional requirement of submitting a written directive given by the Commission when

forwarding an indictment by the Director General CIABOC to High Court other than following the

provisions already identified under Sections 12 (I) and (II) of the CIABOC Act. If the Director General

is directed under Section 11 of the CIABOC Act by the CIABOC to forward an indictment, he is only

bound to follow the provisions in Section 12 (I) and (II) of the CIABOC Act. In the absence of any

complaint, that the Director General CIABOC had failed to comply with Sections 12(I) and (II) of the

CIABOC Act when forwarding the indictment before the High Court at Bar it is correct in refusing the

jurisdictional objection raised on behalf of the 2nd Accused before the High Court at Bar. The Trial

Judge before whom the indictment is filed is therefore bound to accept the indictment and take up

the trial unless there is material to establish that Director General CIABOC had failed to comply with

the provisions of Sections 12 (1) and (2) of the CIABOC Act. Any party who intends to challenge an

indictment forwarded by the Director General CIABOC on the basis that, the CIABOC had failed to

comply with Section 11 of the CIABOC Act, the said challenge could only be raised in an appropriate

action filed before an appropriate forum.

In the said circumstance, I see no merit in the argument placed before us.

Have the charges in the indictment (joinder of charges) been framed in a lawful manner? More

particularly, is the amalgamation of charges 1 and 2 with the rest of the charges lawful, in

that, has the prosecution established that the offences contained in charges 1 and 2 were

committed in the course of the same transaction with the offences contained in the remaining

charges?

The Accused-Appellants before the High Court at Bar had raised an objection to the amended

indictment on the basis that the prosecution could not have lawfully joined the charges in counts 1,

2, and 3 with the rest of the charges as the incidents referred to in charges 1, 2 and 3 do not fall

within the same course of the transaction as the rest of the charges.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 45 of 145 When the objection was raised in the High Court at Bar, the learned judges had decided to address

the said objection after the leading of evidence by the Prosecution. Accordingly, the learned judges

in the judgment dated 19th December 2019 have reached the conclusion that the events relating to

the charges are interconnected and do form part of the same transaction. The learned Judges of the

High Court at Bar have rejected the aforesaid objection of the Appellants.

Let us now consider whether there is merit in this argument. The indictment against both Accused-

Appellants contains 24 charges and we have already mentioned the charges and the sentence

imposed by the High Court at Bar in this Judgment.

Out of the 24 counts in the indictment, counts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 are against

the 1st Accused Appellant; the counts 3, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 are against the 2nd

Accused-Appellant. The charge in count 4 has been framed against both Accused-Appellants

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Accused-Appellants submitted that charges 1 and 2 are in

respect of the alleged solicitation of a bribe of Rs. 450 million (USD 3 million) by the 1st Accused

Appellant on or about 11th August 2016 whereas charges 4 - 24 are solicitation of Rs. 100 million as a

bribe and acceptance of Rs. 20 million as an advance based on a conspiracy set out in charge 4

during the period between 05th September 2017 and 03rd May 2018 and the 3rd charge is for

solicitation of a bribe of Rs 450 million by the 2nd Accused-Appellant on or about 05th September

2017. The learned Presidents Counsel therefore sought to argue that the purpose of soliciting Rs.

450 million in respect of charges 1 and 2 was to permit the virtual complainant to go ahead with the

project whereas the purpose in relation to charge 4 which covers the charge of conspiracy between

1st and 2nd Accused-Appellants to solicit Rs. 100 million is different. It was on that footing that the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Accused-Appellants submitted that while there is a common

factor of soliciting a gratification, the element of community of purpose cannot be inferred by the

same and the Prosecution lacks evidence to prove that there was continuity of action and

community of purpose to enable them to lawfully join the charges on the basis that they had

occurred in the course of the same transaction.

It is also to be noted that the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Accused-Appellant had

submitted before the High Court at Bar that the test used to ascertain whether incidents fall within

the same transaction is the test of Common Agreement ( ), which is not seen in the

current instance. Accordingly, it was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st

Accused-Appellant that charges 1-2 and 3 cannot be joined with the rest of the charges. In other

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 46 of 145 words, the Accused-Appellants had claimed that charges 1 and 2, charges 3, and charges 4 - 24 do

not fall within the course of the same transaction but fall under three separate transactions.

It is the contention of the 1st Accused-Appellant that although the objection was raised at the

correct time in the Trial at Bar, the learned Judges had indicated that they would consider the same

at the end of the trial, misdirecting themselves on the law. Thus, the learned Presidents Counsel

complained that evidence which otherwise would have been inadmissible was permitted in by the

trial Judges. It is therefore the contention of the 1st Accused-Appellant that the Accused-Appellants

did not get a fair trial due to the above alleged lapse on the part of the learned Judges of the

Permanent Trial at Bar.

Let us first reproduce below, the relevant sections from the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15

of 1979.

Section 173 (Separate charge of separate offence)

For every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate

charge and every such charge shall be tried separately except in the cases mentioned in

sections 174, 175, 176 and 180 which said sections may be applied either severally or in

combination.

Section 175 (1) (Trial for more than one offence)

If in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction more

offences than one are committed by the same person he may be charged with and tried

at one trial for every such offence, and in trials before the High Court such charges may

be included in one and the same indictment.

Section 180 (All persons concerned in committing an offence may be charged together)

When more persons than one are accused of jointly committing the same offence or of

different offences committed in the same transaction or when one person is accused of

committing any offence and another of abetment of or attempt to commit such offence, they

may be charged and tried together or separately as the court thinks fit; and the provisions

contained in the former part of this Chapter shall apply to all such charges.

The 1st count (under section 19(b) of the Bribery Act) alleges that on or about 11th August 2016 in

Colombo, the 1st Accused-Appellant being a public servant, (Secretary to the Ministry of Land),

solicited from K. P. Nagarajah (the virtual complainant) a gratification in a sum of USD 3 Million [SLR

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 47 of 145 450 Million], as an inducement or reward for - his expediting or delaying or hindering or preventing

an official act - or for assisting or favouring or for hindering or delaying the transaction of any

business with the Government - that is to say the act of giving unto him the machinery along with

the entirety of the land and premises for the purpose of operating the Kanthale Sugar Factory. The

2nd count is for the same incident but framed under 19(c) of the Bribery Act and therefore the

charge is silent about the purpose for which the alleged gratification was solicited.

The 3rd count (under s. 19(c) of the Bribery Act) alleges that on or about 5th September 2017 in

Colombo, the 2nd Accused-Appellant being a public servant, (the Chairman of the State Timber

Corporation), solicited from K. P. Nagarajah (the virtual Complainant), a gratification in a sum of USD

3 Mil [SLR 450 million].

According to the Respondent, the alleged solicitation has been made in respect of the same

purpose, and the evidence led in the case too clearly shows that the alleged solicitation has been

made in respect of the same purpose which is the act of giving the machinery along with the

entirety of the land and premises for the purpose of operating the Kanthale Sugar Factory. This is

evident from the fact that the 2nd Accused-Appellant had approached the virtual Complainant on 5th

September 2017 to discuss at Waters Edge, the matter relating to the Kanthale Sugar Factory

project and to inform the virtual complainant about the disappointment of the 1st Accused

Appellant. They discussed the recent developments of the project. Although the only

connection/standing that the 2nd Accused Appellant had in this event is his mere close friendship

with the 1st Accused Appellant, evidence shows very clearly that it was the expectation of the 2nd

Accused Appellant to persuade the virtual complainant that he should adhere to the solicitation of

the gratification by the 1st Accused Appellant. The gratification solicited is for non-other than

relating to affairs of the progress of operating the Kanthale Sugar Factory which falls within one and

the same transaction.

The 4th count alleges between the 5th September 2017 and 3rd May 2018 in Colombo, the 1st

Accused-Appellant being a public servant, (the Secretary to the Ministry of Land and the Presidents

Chief of Staff) and the 2nd Accused Appellant, being a public servant, (the Chairman of the State

Timber Corporation) agreed to act together with or without any previous concert or deliberation

with the common intention for or in committing or abetting the offence of soliciting from K. P.

Nagarajah, a gratification in a sum of SLR 100 million and the said offence was committed in

consequence of the said conspiracy and they thereby committed the offence of Conspiracy

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 48 of 145 punishable under section 25(3) of the Bribery Act read with section 19(c) of the Bribery Act. The

incident in count 4 too was committed on the same day as charge 3 (5th of September 2017). Counts

4 - 24 are connected to the aforesaid conspiracy to solicit Rs. 100 million as a bribe and acceptance

of Rs. 20 million as an advance based on the same. Indeed, according to the Prosecution, both the

Accused-Appellants had been present when the advance of Rs. 20 million was handed over by the

virtual Complainant at the car park of Taj Samudra Hotel.

While it is clear from the above facts that the charges in counts 4-24 can be joined along with the

charges in counts 1-3 under section 175(1) and section 180 of the Criminal Procedure Code on the

basis that they had occurred in the course of the same transaction, let us proceed to consider how

our Courts have applied this principle in the past.

In Jonklaas vs Somadasa 43 NLR 284, Wijeyewardene J took into consideration that the substantial

test for determining whether several offences are committed in the course of the same transaction

is to ascertain whether they are so related to one another in point of purpose or as cause and effect

or as principal and subsidiary acts as to constitute one continuous action. His Lordship then went on

to hold as follows.

a community of purpose and a continuity of action which are regarded as essential

elements necessary to link together different acts so as to form one and the same

transaction.

This was followed by Alles J in Don Wilbert vs Sub Inspector Chilaw 69 NLR 448 where the accused

was charged on two counts; the first count was for driving a vehicle in a negligent manner; the

second count was for failure to report the said accident to the Officer-in-Charge of the nearest

Police Station after driving the said vehicle on the said highway at the same time and place and after

having met with an accident causing injury to another, an offence punishable under section 224 of

the Motor Traffic Act.

In the case of The King V. Aman 21 NLR 375 the Accused was prosecuted upon an indictment

containing two counts, one for causing hurt to one Sena Abdul Cader, and the other for voluntarily

causing hurt to one Cader Meera Saibo. The accused has had words with the man who is the subject

of the second count (Cader Meera Saibo), pulled out a knife, and stabbed him. He then rushed along

the street, which had several boutiques, and had seen Sena Abdul Cader at a place about thirty

yards from the place where he committed the first offence. He had an altercation with him the

previous day about some rice. The Accused reminded him of that occurrence and stabbed Sena

Abdul Cader also. The two offences were committed in the same street, and the man who was

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 49 of 145 struck on the occasion of the second offence could see from where he was standing, the disturbance

going on in which the first offence was committed. One of the two objections raised in the appeal

was that these two offences could not be considered as a series of acts so connected together as to

form the same transaction. In that case, Bertram C.J. holding that the acts were so connected

together as to form the same transaction stated as follows;

The real truth is that in all cases that question is a question of fact. The word " transaction,"

is defined in the Imperial Dictionary (which seems very closely to follow the definition in

Webster) as " that which is done or takes place, an affair." Had the expression in our section

been '' a series of acts so connected together as to form the same affair " there would have

been no question as to the meaning. The word " transaction " does not necessarily mean

something which takes place between parties. That is explained in the case of Drinecqbier v.

Wood ([1899) 1Oh.Div.397.), where Byrne J., in interpreting a similar phrase under the

English rules of procedure, instances the case of a traction engine proceeding along a

highway and causing damage to a terrace of several houses. He says: " In the illustration

suggested by the illegal use of a traction engine passing in front of them, each owner would

have to prove his title to his house, but the other questions of fact and law would be common

to all the owners, and I have no doubt that they could all sue in one action."

In Don Wilberts case the two offences that were joined, did not even take place between the same

parties. The said incidents were joined on the premise that it was committed by the same person

one after the other. The Court did not hesitate to treat them as a series of acts so connected

together as part of the same transaction. In the instant case, not only are the incidents connected

and interwoven together but have occurred in the same course of events following one other.

Further, all those incidents had occurred between the same parties namely the Accused-Appellants

and the virtual Complainant.

In regard to the instant matter, it is the view of this Court that there exists a common purpose that

runs throughout the charges 1-2,3 up to 4-24 which purpose being the need to obtain a bribe and to

scuttle and delay the process in order to apply pressure on the virtual complainant to pay the bribe.

Further, it is evident that the 1st Accused Appellant has sought the assistance of the 2nd Accused

Appellant to solicit the bribe from the virtual complainant. The Respondent has relied on the

telephone records in establishing the same. The 1st Accused Appellant has made a call to the 2nd

Accused Appellant even prior to the 2nd Accused Appellant contacting the complainant on 5th

September 2017.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 50 of 145 Following the incident on the 5th of September 2017, there had been three attempts to solicit a

bribe i.e., on the 27th of February 2018, the 28th of April 2018, and the 03rd of May 2018. In all of the

above three instances, the 2nd Accused-Appellant had been involved in facilitating the transactions.

Further in all 5 attempts of solicitation (11/08/2016, 05/09/2017, 27/02/2018, 28/04/2018, and

03/05/2018) the purpose of the bribe was to expedite the process and/or grant clearance of

handing over the land and machinery of Kanthale old Sugar Factory to the virtual Complainant and

or to his company. Thus, the 2nd Accused-Appellant had throughout been involved in soliciting and

aiding the 1st Accused-Appellant.

Further, it should be noted that although there was no telephone correspondence between the 1st

Accused-Appellant and the virtual Complainant during the period August 2016 to September 2017,

the subject file maintained at the 1st Accused-Appellant Ministry reveals the continuous

correspondence between the 1st Accused-Appellant and the Complainant. The relevant

correspondence has been submitted before court by Prosecution Witness No. 37.

Accordingly, by the letter dated 16th January 2017 produced marked P-70 it is evident that the 1st

Accused-Appellant has sought the opinion of the Attorney General when the same was not

required. According to the Prosecution, that was to delay the process. Further, letters produced

marked P 67 dated 17th December 2016 and P 73 dated 10th February 2017 prove that the 1st

Accused-Appellant had unduly delayed the handing over of the land. The letter produced marked P

75 dated 6th March 2017 further indicates that the 1st Accused-Appellant had once again sought

instructions relating to the same issue; this too according to the Prosecution, was to willfully delay

the progress of the process.

The Prosecution has also adduced the letters produced marked P-80A dated 8th June 2017, P 80

dated 9th June 2017, and P 83 dated 7th August 2017 to further indicate that the 1st Accused-

Appellant had continued to delay the process.

On the other hand, the mere absence of telephone communications between the 1st Accused-

Appellant and the virtual Complainant during the period August 2016 to September 2017 does not

mean that the relevant parties terminated altogether, the solicitation process they had already

started and commenced a fresh solicitation process. Such thinking is far-fetched. Moreover, even if

it is so, it is by and large, for the same purpose. Therefore, the continuity of action and the

community of purpose are remarkably present in the incidents described in the charges.

Accordingly, it is evident that while the process pertaining to soliciting the gratification had

commenced on 11th August 2016 and ended only on 3rd May 2018 running through a time span little

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 51 of 145 over of 1 1/2 years, the 1st Accused Appellant has continued to pursue his aim of soliciting and

accepting the gratification from the virtual Complainant throughout the said period with the

involvement of the 2nd Accused Appellant also in the process, right through from 5th September

2017 onwards.

Therefore, there is lucid evidence to hold that the Accused-Appellants have acted with a community

of purpose and continuity action linking counts 1-2 and count 3 with the rest of the counts (4-24),

creating one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction. Therefore, we

find the joinder of charges in the instant case to be lawful and there is no misjoinder as alleged by

the Accused-Appellants.

Has the Prosecution proved aliunde that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two or

more persons have conspired together to commit an offence? If not, was resorting to section 10 of

the Evidence Ordinance lawful?

In count 04 of the indictment, the 1st and 2nd Accused-Appellants have been charged with the

offence of conspiracy under section 25 (3) of the Bribery Act read with section 19 (c) of the Bribery

Act as amended and section 113 A of the Penal Code. The said count is to the following effect,

That on between the 5th September 2017 and 3rd May 2018 at Colombo, within the jurisdiction

of this Court, in the course of the same transaction the 1st Accused Appellant being a public

servant, i.e., the Secretary of the Ministry of Land and the President's Chief of Staff, and the 2nd

Accused Appellant being a public servant, i.e., the Chairman of the State Timber Corporation

agreed to act together with or without any previous concert or deliberation with the common

intention for or in committing or abetting the offence of soliciting from K P Nagarajah,

gratification in a sum of SLR 100 Million and the said offence was committed in consequence of

the said conspiracy and they thereby committed the offence of "Conspiracy " punishable under

s. 25(3) of the Bribery Act read with s.19(c) of the Bribery Act as amended by Acts No.2/1965,

38/1974, 9/1980 and s. 113A of the Penal Code.

It is the contention of the 1st Accused-Appellant that the Prosecution has not placed before Court

material aliunde, to prove that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Accused-

Appellants have conspired together to commit the offence described in count 4.

The 1st Accused-Appellant submits that the only evidence the Prosecution has submitted in this

regard, are statements alleged to have been made by the 2nd Accused-Appellant to the investigating

officers regarding discussions he is alleged to have had with the 1st Accused-Appellant. Accordingly,

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 52 of 145 the 1st Accused-Appellant submitted that these items of evidence are hearsay which would be made

admissible only under section 10 of the Evidence Ordinance which is as follows.

Section 10 (Things said or done by conspirator in reference to common intention.)

Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired

together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, anything said, done, or written by

any one of such persons in reference to their common intention, after the time when such

intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against each of

the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the purpose of proving the existence

of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it.

illustrations

Reasonable ground exists for believing that A has joined in a conspiracy to wage war

against the Queen.

The facts that B procured arms in Europe for the purpose of the conspiracy, C collected

money in Colombo for a like object, D persuaded persons to join the conspiracy in Kandy,

E published writings advocating the object in view at Galle, and F transmitted from

Kalutara to G at Negombo the money which C had collected at Colombo, and the contents

of a letter written by H giving an account of the conspiracy, are each relevant, both to

prove the existence of the conspiracy and to prove A 's complicity in it, although he may

have been ignorant of all of them, and although the persons by whom they were done

were strangers to him, and although they may have taken place before he joined the

conspiracy or after he left it.

The 1st Accused-Appellant argues that prior to section 10 being applied, the Prosecution must prove

aliunde that there are reasonable grounds to believe that two or more persons have conspired

together to commit an offence. It is the contention of the 1st Accused-Appellant that, in proving

such reasonable grounds the statements to be relied on (under section 10 of the Evidence

Ordinance) cannot themselves be taken as evidence for the existence of reasonable grounds; the

said reasonable grounds should first be established in order to pave the way for the said statements

to be admitted as evidence under section 10 of the Evidence Ordinance, and such evidence

produced to establish the existence of reasonable grounds would also be considered as additional

proof of conspiracy.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 53 of 145 in this regard, the learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Accused-Appellant has cited the case of

Peiris V. Silva 17 NLR 139 at 141. In that case, Perera J had observed as follows;

It is manifest that these statements are no more than mere hearsay as against the first

accused. They are by no means evidence against him. With reference to them the Solicitor-

General cited section 10 of the Evidence Ordinance, but that section applies when it is first

established aliunde that there are reasonable grounds to believe that two or more persons

have conspired together to commit an offence. The statements relied on cannot themselves be

taken as evidence of the existence of such reasonable grounds. Such grounds must first be

established in order to pave the way for the admission of the statements as evidence, and

when so admitted they may be additional proof of the conspiracy.

This question was further considered in the case of King V. Attanayake (1931) 34 NLR 19 where His

Lordship Lyall-Grant J observed thus:

Taylor on Evidence (section 590) states that before any act or declaration of one of a

company of conspirators in regard to the common design as affecting his fellows is led, a

foundation should first be laid by proof, sufficient, in the opinion of the Judge, to establish

prima facie the fact of the conspiracy between the parties, or, at least, proper to be laid

before a jury, as tending to establish such fact. The connection of the individuals in the

unlawful enterprise being shown, every act or declaration of each member of the confederacy

in furtherance of the original concerted plan and with reference to the common object is, in

contemplation of law an act and declaration of all and this is evidence against each other.

This statement of the English law has, I think, exactly the same effect as section 10 of our

Code. Taylor proceeds: -"Sometimes for the sake of convenience the acts or declarations of

one are admitted in evidence before sufficient proof is given of the conspiracy, the prosecutor

undertaking to furnish such proof in a subsequent stage of the case."

In King vs. Attanayake, Lyall-Grant, J. emphasized the followings:

(a) the judge should decide in every case whether or not reasonable grounds exist to believe

that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or an

actionable wrong;

(b) in order to do so, the judge can be guided:

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 54 of 145

(i) by the evidence already led which gives an indication that a conspiracy already

exists; and

(ii) by assurance of the prosecuting counsel that he would at a later stage lead further

evidence.

(c) the existence of a conspiracy need not be conclusively proved in order to render evidence

admissible under Section 10.

In the instant case, the Prosecution has clearly established the existence of reasonable grounds to

believe that the two Accused-Appellants have conspired together to commit this offence. It would

suffice in this regard, to mention here that the Prosecution has produced three main independent

evidence for the said purpose. Firstly, the telephone call records between the Accused-Appellants

and the virtual Complainant; secondly, the video footage in which both Accused-Appellants are

shown acting in concert; thirdly, the conversations that took place amongst the three as admitted

by the two Accused-Appellants.

Moreover, the Prosecution has produced before this Court, a telephone call log showcasing how the

two Appellants have been in continuous communication while the 2nd Accused-Appellant had been

having independent conversations with the virtual Complainant. The telephone records submitted,

show that the 2nd Accused-Appellant had contacted the virtual Complainant via telephone call in

twelve instances (during the time period 24th February 2018 3rd May 2018)/ The telephone log

reveals how the two Accused-Appellants have been in contact with each other either immediately

prior to or subsequent to the 2nd Accused-Appellants telephone conversation with the virtual

complainant. The said records have been established in the High Court at Bar by Prosecution

Witnesses No. 28 and 29 (witness from Sri Lanka Mobitel Co. and Dialog Axiata Co.). In addition to

the above, the 2nd Accused-Appellant has in fact admitted the identity of the voices in the audio

recordings to be of his, the 1st Accused-Appellants and the virtual Complainants. This indicates the

existence of communion and agreement between the two.

Further, the video footage submitted, and the evidence led by the Prosecution confirms the

presence of both Accused-Appellants along with the virtual complainant during the meetings that

had taken place in the run up to the solicitation of the bribe i.e., the meeting at Bread Talk and the

meeting at Taj Samudra Hotel. The presence of both Accused-Appellants and the conduct of both

Accused-Appellants during the said meetings have displayed them acting in concert to infer the

existence of conspiracy. In addition to the above, there is evidence that the 1st Accused-Appellant

requesting for a separate bag from the hotel waiter at Taj Samudra once he got to know that the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 55 of 145 virtual Complainant had brought the money. This when taken together with the other events, leads

to the inference that such request was made to separate the share of the 2nd Accused-Appellant.

Thus, taking all of the above factors into consideration and while keeping in mind the degree of

proof required by the Prosecution is merely to establish a prima facie case of conspiracy, where a

prudent man would feel reasonably convinced that a conspiracy exists, we are of the view that the

Prosecution has satisfied the aforesaid threshold requirement.

For the above reasons, we hold that the Prosecution has proved aliunde, that there are reasonable

grounds to believe that the two Accused-Appellants have conspired together to commit the offence

of conspiracy permitting further evidence in terms of section 10 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Therefore, we hold that the learned Judges of the High Court at Bar have correctly applied section

10 of the Evidence Ordinance in relation to the charge of conspiracy against each of the Accused-

Appellants.

When the admissibility of voice recording was challenged at the time the prosecution sought to

place such recordings before the Court as evidence, was it lawful for the trial judge to have

differed taking a decision on the matter till the end of the trial? or in the alternative, Was it

incumbent on the trial court to have conducted a voire dire inquiry into the matter and make a

prompt ruling regarding the admissibility of the impugned voice recordings?

Was the procedure the trial judges adopted by deferring the decision on the admissibility of the

Voice recordings, cause a miscarriage of justice?

On 13/11/2019 the Counsel for the Prosecution who appeared before the High Court at Bar sought

to place the recordings (converted into a transcript) before the Court as evidence. The Counsel

appearing for the second Accused-Appellant opposed the same stating that the person who

prepared the transcript (in accordance with the voice recordings) was not called before Court as a

witness and that he/she did not sign the transcript, alleging that the authenticity of the transcript is

questionable. Further he submitted to Court that the impugned voice recordings are not clear and

hence the transcript which was made based on such recordings cannot be used as evidence. On the

same day, Court made a prompt order stating that, Court will make an order considering the

objections raised by the Defence at the end of the trial and Court allowed to raise questions based

on the transcript (which made in accordance with the voice recordings). In this order, Court

observed that though some parts of the voice recordings were not clear, the Court cannot neglect

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 56 of 145 the entire voice recording. Further it was emphasized in this order that the Court will consider the

objections raised by the Counsel for the Defence when it would analyze the evidence.

This question of law suggests that, in the alternative, it was incumbent on the trial court to have

conducted a voire dire inquiry into the matter and to have made a prompt ruling regarding the

admissibility of the impugned voice recordings.

In answering the same this Court need to consider voire-dire inquiries and their application. Despite

a judge not being normally required to determine questions of fact before the final judgment, in

certain selected occasions the judge is called upon to do the same, particularly when a disputed

question of fact must be determined in order to decide whether an item of evidence should be

admitted. On these occasions the judge alone determines questions of fact and may generally tend

to hear witnesses in order to do so. This procedure is called a trial-within-a-trail or voire-dire.

The procedure at a voire-dire inquiry usually involves various steps including objection being made

when the evidence is to be called, and the judge then hearing the evidence before ruling on

admissibility, unless the circumstances are exceptional. If the Accused has opted for a jury trial, the

jury is normally sent out and the evidence is heard in its absence. Usually, evidence for both

prosecution and defence is called. Witnesses are sworn on the voire-dire, not on the oath taken

when giving evidence before the jury. Prosecution witnesses may be cross-examined without

affecting the right to cross-examination in the substantive trial. The Accused may give evidence

himself and may call witnesses on his behalf. When deciding the question of admissibility, the judge

should then act on admissible evidence presented at the voire-dire inquiry.

As is evident, a voire-dire inquiry is a protracted procedure which may involve many steps to be

followed and generally this procedure may be adopted in a preliminary examination to determine

competency of a witness available in Court to give evidence. This is done merely to save time as the

Court may decide the competency of a witness at the outset of the trial. However, in the present

case though the learned Counsel for the Accused Appellants contended that the learned Trial Judges

ought to have conducted voire-dire inquiry to decide the admissibility at the outset of the trial itself,

it is our position that holding a voire-dire inquiry is not a sine qua non to decide the admissibility of

evidence.

In the case of Halawa V. Federation Against Copyright Theft ([1995] 1 Cr App Rep 21, DC) of the

Divisional Court of UK, it was held that,

The duty of trial judge, on an application under voire-dire, is either to deal with it when it

arises or to leave the decision until the end of the hearing, with the primary objective

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 57 of 145

being to secure is fair and just trial for both parties. Thus, in certain cases there will be a

trial within a trial in which the accused is given the opportunity to exclude the evidence

before he is required to give evidence on the main issues but in most cases the better course

will be for the whole of the prosecution case to be heard, including the disputed evidence,

before any trial-within-a-trial held.

(Emphasis Added)

There are other occasions when a trial-within-a-trial is appropriate i.e., to determine the

admissibility of tape recordings as held in R v Robson v. Harris, R v Harris (1972) 56 Cr.App.R. 450.

However, a trial within a trial may be appropriate if the issues are limited but not if it is likely to be

protracted and to raise issues which will need to be re-examined in the trial itself. Hence, it is our

considered view that the voire-dire inquiry is a trial within a trial and should be used in the

appropriate circumstances. It is not to be used as a means of protracting proceedings, which would

in such case defeat the very purpose of having a trial before a High Court-at-Bar. In the instant case,

there was sufficient material in the form of submissions of both parties before the Learned Judges

to decide the admissibility of the audio recordings at the time they allowed the prosecution to lead

such evidence. Hence we hold that it was lawful for the learned Trial Judges to have differed taking

a decision on the matter till the end of the trial.

Further, in the impugned order Court made the decision to allow/place such recordings before the

Court as evidence due to the fact that the 2nd Accused Appellant on many occasions accepted the

voice recordings and its content. The excerpt of the order of the Trial Court is as follows:

,

.

.

The above can simply be translated to the effect that the trial court decided to determine whether

the Voice Recordings are admissible evidence for the purpose for which they are led by the

prosecution, at the end of the trial. In the meantime, the Court stated that they did not see any

basis to disallow questioning based on matters pertaining to the Recordings for the reason that, at

such time, the Accused had already admitted matters in the recordings to a large extent during the

trial.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 58 of 145 It must be noted that this decision was made after consideration of the fact that the evidence was

already almost admitted by the accused during the trial. This court observes that the opinion and

impression created in the mind of laymen in being faced with evidence is drastically different to that

of Judges who consider and evaluate these matters with a judicially trained mind and ample

experience. The Judges who were at the Trial-at-Bar have proceeded to hear evidence as they have

been capable of distinguishing the difference between admissibility of the evidence as a whole, as

opposed to leading evidence for the limited purpose of identity towards the end. The High Court

Judgment has dissected the admissibility of this evidence based on identity, content, safe custody

and the implication of the evidence and considered each segment on its own merit. As such, this

court does not find that this evidence has tainted the decision detrimentally to the accused.

Based on the above, the decision made by the judges to answer the issue regarding the admissibility

of voice recordings at the end of the trial is acceptable as doing otherwise would merely have

protracted proceedings, which defeats the very purpose of the trial. Therefore, this Court observes

that the learned Trial Judges have not erred in allowing the prosecution to lead the audio recordings

in evidence in the course of the trial and that the procedure adopted by the trial judges in deferring

the decision on the admissibility of the voice recordings has not caused any miscarriage of Justice.

Did the Magistrate have power/Judicial Authority to give voice samples to the Government

Analyst? Was the compulsion of the Accused Appellants to give voice samples to the Government

Analyst a breach of the rule against self-incrimination and did it cause a miscarriage of Justice?

A prerequisite to the steps of voice identification, particularly for the purpose of

Spectrographic and Automatic Analysis is the taking of voice samples from a conversation conducted

with the concerned party as well as samples from reading a transcript based on recurring words in

the recordings. In furtherance of this aim, the learned Magistrate had made an order dated 5th June

2018 under Section 124 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in relation to obtaining voice samples

from the 1st and 2nd Accused Appellants as well as the Complainant. The Counsel appearing for the

Accused Appellant had objected to the order on the basis that the Magistrate did not have the

power under Section 124 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to make such order. Having

considered the objection, the Magistrate had rejected the same.

The High Court appears to have relied on the cases of Ritesh Sinha v Uttar Pradesh, R v

Suppiah and King v Francis Perera in coming to the conclusion that the Magistrate was acting within

their powers with the said order. This court is faced with two Questions in this regard; firstly,

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 59 of 145 whether the Magistrate had power/judicial authority to give voice samples to the Government

Analyst, and secondly, whether the compulsion of the Accused Appellants to give voice samples to

the Government Analyst amounts to a breach of the rule against self-incrimination and thereby

caused a miscarriage of Justice.

Section 124 based on which the Magistrates order has been issued is as follows:

Every Magistrate to whom application is made in that behalf shall assist the conduct of an

investigation by making and issuing appropriate orders and processes of court, and may, in

particular hold, or authorize the holding of, an identification parade for the purpose of

ascertaining the identity of the offender, and may for such purpose require a suspect or any

other person to participate in such parade, allow a witness to make his identification from a

concealed position and make or cause to be made a record of the proceedings of such

parade.

In terms of the above, the Accused Appellants argue that the scope of this provision is restricted to

the purposes of empowering the Magistrate to hold identification parades, as supported by the fact

that the only amendment made to this section pertains to the conduct of such identification

parades. Further, it is the position of the Accused that this is supported by Section 123 and the

amendments thereof.

Section 123 as amended states,

(1) Where any officer in charge of a police station is of opinion that it is necessary to do so

for the purpose of an investigation, he may cause any finger, palm or foot impression or

impression of any part of the body of any person suspected of the offence under

investigation or any specimen of blood, saliva, urine, hair or finger nail or any scraping from

a finger nail of such person to be taken with his consent.

(2) Where the person referred to in subsection (1) does not consent to such impression,

specimen or scraping being taken, such police officer may apply to the Magistrate's Court

within whose jurisdiction the investigation is being made for an order authorizing a police

officer to take such impression, specimen or scraping and such person shall comply with such

order.

(3) Any officer in charge of a police station may, where it is necessary for the purpose of the

investigation to compare any handwriting, cause a specimen of the handwriting of any

person to be taken with his consent.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 60 of 145

(4) Where such person refuses to give a specimen of his handwriting the officer in charge of

the police station may apply to the Magistrate's Court within whose jurisdiction the

investigation is being made for an order requiring such person to give a specimen of his

handwriting, and such person shall comply with such order.

The Accused Appellants claim that the entry of blood to sub section (1) above by Section 3 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act No 14 of 2005 supports the position that should the

Act empower the magistrate to order the taking of voice samples, the same would have been

included in express terms as was done in 2005. As such, they argue that the lack of express

authorization is an implication of intentional exclusion of this authority.

However, in interpreting the above provision it is rather apparent that all specimen, impression or

scraping; finger, palm or foot impression, impression of any part of the body, specimen of blood,

saliva, urine, hair, finger nail, any scraping from a finger nail, or handwriting of any suspect, all relate

to identification of the suspect in the course of an investigation, by comparison of samples found in

relation to the relevant offence at the scene. As such the purpose of the voice samples directly

corresponds to such purpose.

Most importantly, Section 124 in essence provides for the Magistrate to assist the conduct of an

investigation by making and issuing appropriate orders and processes of court while the portion

allowing for the conduct of identification ...and may, in particular... simply indicates that the

Magistrate can also hold or authorize the holding of identification parades for the purpose of

ascertaining the identity of the offender.

Interpretation of this section at such face value does not provide any assistance to crime

investigations . Firstly, it must be noted that the primary purpose is not only holding identification

parades but rather to provide judicial assistance for the conduct of investigations using the powers

vested in the Magistrate to issue processes of court, which is a power neither lightly granted, nor

vested in the investigators themselves. As such, this provision allows providing such assistance not

provided for under the preceding provisions, to assist identification of suspects. The provision for

identification parades is therefore rather an extension of this same power rather than a restriction

of it.

The High Court at bar has also considered Section 7 of the Act which states

As regards matters of criminal procedure for which special provisions may not have

been made by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force such procedure

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 61 of 145

as the justice of the case may require and as is not inconsistent with this Code may be

followed.

Considering the above, the taking of voice samples is indeed a procedure which the Code nor any

other law expressly provides for, however as discussed above, it is in no way inconsistent with the

Code and is aimed at achieving justice as is required in the instant case.

However, the Accused Appellants raise a secondary question whether the above order to provide

evidence would potentially incriminate them on positive identification would amount to a violation

of the rule against self-incrimination. The Evidence Ordinance Section 120(6) on Competency of

witnesses provide that the accused shall be a competent witness in his own behalf, accordingly, the

accused cannot be compelled to provide evidence against himself.

In Sri Lanka, this has been tested previously in Rex v Suppiah (1931) Cey. Law Recorder 31, where

the accused was compelled by an order of the Magistrate to provide impressions of fingerprints,

which cited an observation made in a case before a Full bench of the High Court of Burma, King

Emperor v Tun Hlaing (1923) I.L.R. 1 Ran. 759, F.B. wherein it was remarked that:

The Court was not in effect compelling him to provide evidence against himself, since what

really constituted the evidence, viz, the ridges of his thumb, are not provided by him any

more than the features of his countenance

Further the case of King v. Francis Perera 9 NLR 122 was cited, wherein a sample of handwriting was

taken on an order of the Magistrate. In this instance, Middleton J was of the following view,

It seems to me that the writing of these words and letter was merely the creation of facts,

which standing alone were of no probative value, but which, when coupled or compared

with some other facts in the case, might suggest an inference one way or the other, and

until that comparison or conjunction was made, no inference arose.

The above view was concurred by Wendt J who stated thus:

They are not, the embodiment in language of any facts or opinions. The mere fact that they

suggest an inference of guilt is not enough

In considering the instant case in light of the above, it is apparent that providing samples of his voice

in conversation and via reading a transcript does not by itself amount to a confession and is merely

a matter of providing a sample of the characteristics inherent to a persons voice, as opposed to

posing questions in regard to the contents of the conversations at such stage of investigation. The

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 62 of 145 evidence of the recordings is of relevance at the comparison of the samples and on arriving at a

conclusion as to identity of the suspect. It is primarily of relevance that certain communications, of

whatever content, were constantly recurring between the parties at hand. The providing of voice

samples to arrive at conclusions on scientific basis is a discovery of relevant fact and does not

amount to a confession in the sense of violating rule against self-incrimination. To interpret it in

such manner negates the functionality of Sections 123 and 124 as has been utilized since the

enactment of these provisions. In the instant case this evidence is solely of corroborative value.

As neither of the above circumstances pertain to Voice Samples, the case of Ritesh Sinha v

State of Uttar Pradesh (2013) 2 SCC 357 cited cases including that of State of Bombay v Kathi Kalu

Oghad (1961) AIR 1808 in which the following observations were made by the then Chief Justice B.P

Sinha:

Self-incrimination must mean conveying information based upon the personal knowledge

of the person giving the information and cannot include merely the mechanical process of

producing documents in court which may throw a light on any of the points in controversy,

but which do not contain any statement of the accused based on his personal knowledge.

In order that a testimony by an accused person may be said to have been self- incriminatory,

the compulsion of which comes within the prohibition, of the constitutional provision, it

must be of such a character that by itself it should have the tendency of incriminating the

accused, if riot also of actually doing so. In other words, it should be a statement which

makes the case against the accused person at least probable, considered by itself. A

specimen handwriting or signature or finger impressions by themselves are no testimony at

all, being wholly innocuous because they are unchangeable except in rare cases where the

ridges of the fingers or the style of writing have been tampered with. They are only materials

for comparison in order to lend assurance to the Court that its inference based on other

pieces of evidence is reliable...

Applying the above to the instant case, the compelling of the accused to provide voice

samples cannot be considered self-incriminatory as it does not make the case against the accused

probable by itself, rather it is used upon positive identification only in conjunction with other

reliable evidence against the accused. Accordingly, the provided voice samples do not amount to a

confession and is not self-incriminatory in nature. It is simply the process whereby facts pertaining

to the identity of the accused can be ascertained.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 63 of 145

Additionally, the Accused Appellants in their submissions raised a question of the

compulsion to provide voice samples being a violation of the rights of the Petitioner. However, as in

the Ritesh Singh case, in the specific context of the instant case, the position in Sri Lanka is that the

right to privacy cannot be construed as absolute. The suspect under investigation must bow down to

compelling public interest and the Magistrates power to order him to give a sample of his voice for

the purpose of investigation of a crime. Such power has been conferred on a Magistrate in order to

exercise his jurisdiction vested in him under the aforementioned provisions of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

Considering all above, it is the opinion of this court that the Magistrate had power to give voice

samples to the Government Analyst and the compulsion of the Accused Appellants to give voice

samples is not a breach of the rule against self-incrimination nor has it caused a miscarriage of

Justice or violation of their rights.

Is Voice Analysis in the manner conducted by Witness Gunathilaka, Assistant Examiner of Questioned

Documents of the Government Analyst Department a Science?

It must be noted that this question of law at hand is not solely whether Voice Identification itself is a

science, but rather whether the Voice Identification in the manner conducted by Witness

Gunathilaka qualifies it as a science.

Since the question whether witness Gunathilaka is an expert in Voice Identification has been dealt

with, we may consider the circumstances under which the evidence of this witness becomes

relevant to the instant matter. As per Section 45 of the Evidence Ordinance, opinions of experts are

relevant in certain instances. It is as follows:

When the Court has to form an opinion as to foreign law, or of science, or art, or as to

identity or genuineness of handwriting or finger impressions, palm impressions or foot

impressions, the opinions upon that point of persons specially skilled in such foreign law,

science, or art, or in questions as to identity or genuineness of handwriting or finger

impressions, palm impressions or foot impressions, are relevant.

Such persons are called experts.

Accordingly, an expert is a person specially skilled in such science. The Accused Appellants

have stated in their Written submissions that by the exclusion of any reference to voice in the

above provision, the legislature never intended to provide for matters of Voice Identification. As has

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 64 of 145 been observed in the Judgment of the High Court, it must be noted that this provision was enacted

in 1895. It is rather apparent that the science of Audio Forensics was not developed at the time of

enactment of the Evidence Ordinance. Despite a lack of substantial amendments, this provision is

still operable on the basis that the provision does not restrict the interpretation of what may

amount to a science or an art, thus leaving room for the evolution of the same based on available

technology, modern developments with the passage of time. The approach of courts has been aptly

demonstrated in Singho Appu v the King (1944) 46 NLR 49, which stated thus;

Science and art in section 45 of the Evidence Ordinance are to be construed widely

It must also be noted that all areas of expertise expressly provided for in this provision pertain to

the ascertainment of identity through the use of science. This has been the basis for leading

evidence on many other matters of which expert evidence is admissible in Sri Lankan Courts, that

solely fall within the ambit of science, despite lack of direct mention in Section 45.

Further, as per illustration c of Section 45,

The question is, whether a certain document was written by A. Another document is

produced which is proved or admitted to have been written by A. The opinion of experts on

the question whether the two documents were written by the same person or by different

persons, are relevant.

In terms of the above illustration, it is apparent that Section 45 stands to provide for expert

evidence on identification. In the instant case, the evidence of the Expert Witness has only been

used by the High Court to establish that the speakers in the recorded conversations were in fact the

Accused Appellants. It appears that the question whether the voices of the speakers in the

recordings as stated by the Complainant were the same voices of the Accused Appellants as per the

voice samples provided by them. It is rather similar to the question whether the handwriting is of

the same or different persons as raised in the illustration above. Considering all, in the event Voice

Identification is considered a science in the manner conducted by the Expert Witness, expert

evidence of the same is admissible under Section 45 of the Evidence Ordinance.

In the matter of assessing whether Voice Identification in the manner conducted by the expert

witness is a science, the factor of whether the procedure followed during analysis is scientific is of

relevance. The High Court considered the fact that Voice Identification has been a developing area

of research in Forensic science which has been evolving since World War II. The understanding

behind this area of research has drastically evolved since its early days leading to higher levels of

accuracy and many more available reliable methods to achieve its objective. The Witness has

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 65 of 145 explained how technological advancements have brought format comparison on par with DNA and

handwriting analysis.

As already discussed in this Judgment, prosecution in the instant case had heavily relied on the

identification of the two Accused-Appellants through their voice, and as already referred to above,

PW 41 Dulani Lalithya Gunathilake testified before the High Court at Bar regarding her expertise on

the matter and her findings with regard to the examination conducted on the voice samples

submitted before her.

The High court Judgment reproduces at length, the basis of such analysis as described by witness

Gunathilake in her evidence and the process utilized to analyze the impugned recordings. Witness

Gunathilake in her evidence states specific factors considered in Voice Identification.

The witness described the physiological process through which voice is produced and perceived by a

human being. This has been done to explain how this field is being treated as a science. A voice is

produced by a stream of air starting at the lungs and moving through the larynx vibrating the vocal

cords in it. The vibrations are released as sound waves. The sound waves would differ on factors

such as the thickness of the walls of the larynx, the length of the vocal cords, their shape, and the

amount of air that flows through it. The sound waves that take different shapes on the above

factors would be reflected as formants in the analysis.

The witness also explained that there are four formants in the Human Voice (Named 1,2,3 and 4)

Out of the above four formants, the human ear can only perceive the 1st and 2nd formants. The 3rd

and 4th formants out of the above are unique to each individual just like handwriting and DNA and is

not affected by imitation. The witness explained that the analysis of the above formants is therefore

accepted as a science.

In terms of the steps involved in the scientific analysis as conducted by the witness, the steps as

described were firstly that of Critical Listening. Critical Listening is explained as a focused form of

listening where small segments are listened to repeatedly. Qualities such as primary frequency,

pitch, volume, duration of periods of silence of the speaker, speed of speech, dynamics, the stress

put on words/ enunciation of words, accent, words frequently used by the speaker, geographical

variations in speech, and stammering are perceived and analyzed at this stage. As explained a voice

sample is listened to over one hundred times and Spectrogram Analysis is also conducted to identify

the formants in the voices at this stage.

The Second Step is the extraction of voice samples from the individuals in question. Having a normal

conversation with the subjects is done first in this process. While basic aspects of the voice are

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 66 of 145 checked, the subjects are later given a transcript to read out. The transcripts are extractions from

the recordings that are produced for analysis. The portions from the transcripts are compared with

the same portions of the questioned recordings when doing the formant analysis.

The witness further opined that the next expected development in this field would be automatic

comparison. Even though such a software is used nowadays during the course of analysis, it is said

not to be accurate enough to express an opinion based on that alone, Therefore the comparison is

not solely based on the automatic analysis giving a margin for errors. The final comparison results

are also subjected to review. The witness also explained how her report, in this case, has been

subjected to review and agreed upon.

In addition to the above, she has stated that she has taken care to observe any background noises

that would affect the analysis. Other factors considered had included whether the voice provided

for analysis is a computer-generated voice which is evaluated during the Critical listening stage and

through observations done during this phase and she was satisfied that no editing has been done.

The witness has discussed the extraction process of the recordings and the obtaining of the voice

samples from witness which will be considered in due course in the analysis of the relevant

questions of law. In Cross examination, she was extensively questioned on the validity of the

Spectrographic analysis, to which she provided substantial responses with an explanation to the

effect that the Spectrographic approach is supplemented by Critical Listening, automatic analysis,

and review.

In terms of Audio recorded Evidence and Identification of an accused by voice, such evidence has

been admissible in Sri Lanka for well over half a century. The High Court cites and relies on the Case

of Abu Bakr v The Queen (1953) 54 NLR 566. In this case, the prosecution adduced evidence to the

effect that the incriminating speech in question, which allegedly attempted to promote feelings of

ill-will and hostility between different classes of the King's subjects, was electronically recorded, and

subsequently reproduced, by means of an instrument and that when it was reproduced it was taken

down in writing by an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department, named Wijesena, and that

the document containing the text of the speech as taken down by him. The said Wijesena gave

evidence, identified the document, and read it aloud to the jury. One of the grounds of appeal is

that this document was inadmissible. In this case, an element of Voice Identification was discussed.

Gunasekere J considered the evidence reproduced by electronic means to be admissible under S.11

of the evidence Ordinance under the below premise:

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 67 of 145

There was evidence before the jury, about the working of the wire recorder, upon which it

was open to them to hold that the instrument could accurately record a speech and

reproduce it; .

The police sergeant who had operated the instrument at the time of the speeches gave

evidence to the effect that it was he who operated it later to reproduce the sounds recorded

on P1 so that Wijesena might take down the appellant's speech as reproduced; and that he

identified the appellant's voice on that occasion. Another police sergeant, too, gave

evidence to the effect that he was present on both occasions and that he too identified the

voice that was reproduced as the voice of the appellant.

The speech that is alleged to have been reproduced in Wijesena's hearing by means of the

wire recorder is a fact that, in connection with the other facts alleged by the prosecution

witnesses regarding the making of a speech by the appellant and the recording and

reproduction of it, makes it highly probable that the appellant made a speech in the same

terms on the occasion in question. Therefore, if it is not a fact that is otherwise relevant, it is

relevant under section 11 of the Evidence Ordinance; which provides that facts not

otherwise relevant are relevant if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make

the existence of any fact in issue or relevant fact highly probable. .. Therefore, even if the

document itself was inadmissible there was before the jury admissible oral evidence of what

was heard by Wijesena, from which they could infer what was said by the appellant and was

recorded on the spool of wire P1.

As such the use of voice recording for the purpose of identification of an individual is not entirely a

foreign concept to Sri Lankan Courts. The above case was cited for further discussion of this matter

in the case of Karunaratne V. The Queen (1966) 69 NLR 10 concerning a wire recording of a

telephone conversation in which the police accused a solicitation of a bribe as inducement for the

performance of an official function. The evidence was to be led in the form of the transcript of this

conversation, however, the original recording itself was played in court. Hon. Justice T. S. Fernando,

J observed:

It was next urged on behalf of the appellant that, before the tape- recorded evidence was

acted upon, the trial judge should have considered the evidence of an expert the defence

called at the trial to prove, inter alia, that (1) there are dangers in attempting to identify

speakers by their voices as relayed through tape-recorders and (2) the dangers attendant

upon such identification are greater in a case where what is relayed is a telephone

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 68 of 145

conversation, and that too a taped telephone conversation. I think the criticism made in this

regard is just.

However, the omission of the same was not fatal in the above case owing to ample surrounding

evidence to substantiate the charge, as the Judges believed the wire recorded evidence was

relevant principally as corroborative evidence touching identity. As evidence was led extensively on

the matter of the margin of error in voice identification as well as the actual risk of using the

evidence, we find that the circumstances mentioned in Karunaratne case do not apply against the

admissibility of the recorded evidence in the instant case.

However, both law and science have developed exponentially since the above decisions. The above

cases referred to witnesses simply identifying a suspect by voice and did not delve into determining

the admissibility of evidence as a science nor consider expert evidence based on the same.

Accordingly, the evidence of Voice Identification has predominantly been used in the past where the

witness is familiar with the voice of the perpetrator.

Thus, in discussing whether the methodology used in the instant case is recognized in courts of law

as a Science, we may turn to available research and determinations in other Jurisdictions.

In terms of available research, in delving into the development of this field of science visible speech

as a quantitative and legible form of speech was propounded by Melville Bell, and continued by his

son, Alexander Graham Bell, and was furthered by the efforts of Bell Telephone Laboratories. The

development of this technology was initially for the benefit of the deaf community, but the use of

the Spectrograph and related technology was later rated a war project given the military interests in

this technology. The technology of voiceprints, coined with obvious reference to fingerprints, for

the purpose of Voice Identification was furthered during this time and was later controversially used

in forensic applications by engineer Lawrence Kersta. Others soon discovered that context

dependence is important to perform identification and an aural perspective was suggested to

increase the accuracy of identification, which has been supported by research subsequently.

Accordingly, the development of the methodology as it stands today predominantly focuses on the

use of four general approaches including the Auditory Approach, the Spectrographic approach, the

Acoustic-phonetic approach, and the Automatic Approach.

In determining whether the utilized procedure is scientific, the High Court has relied on that of

Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. 509 U.S. 579. This case was preceded by the case of

Frye V. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923), which had set the standard of admissibility of

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 69 of 145 expert opinion based on a scientific technique. In determining the admissibility of novel scientific

evidence, it was famously stated that:

Just when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and

demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential

force of the principle must be recognized, and while the courts will go a long way in

admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery,

the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have

gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs

(Emphasis added)

This above general acceptance test was applied in determining the admissibility of expert

evidence on spectrographic voice identification in many instances, including that of US v Smith 869

F.2d 348 (7th Circuit 1989). In this instance, the court was faced with a unique situation of identical

twins who had committed financial fraud. The women were indicted and tried together for posing as

bank employees and having telephoned banks authorizing them to make wire transfers of non-

existent funds. Given that identity was a core dispute at the trial the government had led evidence

provided by a Voice Identification Expert who utilized the Spectrographic approach to determine

which of the twins had made certain phone calls. It was argued on behalf of the defence that Voice

Identification did not pass this test of general acceptance. However, based on sufficient evidence of

the reliability of this technique being adduced at trial by a description of the principles behind and

the technique used to make spectrographs, as well as the technique being unlikely to mislead the

jury, The evidence was held to be admissible.

However, in the case of Daubert V. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. 509 U.S. 579, as has been

relied on by the High Court, it was held that, faced with expert scientific testimony, the trial judge,

must make a preliminary assessment of whether the testimony's underlying reasoning or

methodology is scientifically valid and can be properly applied to the facts at hand. Many

considerations will bear on the inquiry, including whether the theory or technique in question can

be (and has been) tested, whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication, its known

or potential error rate and the existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation,

and whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within a relevant scientific community. The

inquiry is a flexible one, and its focus must be solely on principles and methodology, not on the

conclusions that they generate. Throughout, the judge should also be mindful of other applicable

rules.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 70 of 145 While it is specified that this is not an exhaustive list, the considerations therein mentioned are

sound in assessing whether the scientific method is sound, beyond simply the General Acceptance

test of Frye.

In the instant case, the Witness has provided information as to the above. She has expounded on

the acceptance of this science within the relevant scientific community of Forensic Audio Analysis,

and the methods utilized are supported by current scientific findings in this field of science.

Additionally, the software and devices used and their acceptance as suitable for the purposes used,

and she has provided a clear answer as to the margin of error and potential risks, including the

methods used to mitigate errors as far as possible through using a combination of multiple standard

methods. As has been aptly noted, the inquiry is a flexible one wherein the methodology used in

each science must be considered for its own merit as opposed to a strict checklist to be satisfied.

The expert witness has conducted this examination with careful attention on the process and has

not hesitated in indicating instances where she could not give conclusive answers, giving her

reasoning for such instances. Additionally, her findings are not merely her own, but have been

reviewed and approved by competent individuals in her department.

In terms of the error rate, a hundred percent infallibility or unanimity is not a precondition

for general acceptance of scientific evidence under our law. Allowing for substantial technological

advancement since the decision in the case of U.S. Vs. Smith (Supra) in terms of the Spectrograph

analysis alone as it was in that time, the error rates as admitted and discussed in that case, prove

that there is a certain margin of error as has been elaborated by numerous studies. However, it is

also mentioned that many difficulties encountered in Voice identification using tapes not recorded

under laboratory conditions will increase the error rate of false eliminations. As such, instead of

results in more false identifications, these variations would result in more false eliminations, doing

away with prejudice that may be caused to the accused by the conditions of the recording.

In the instant case this is assisted by the element of the accent and speech style of the two accused,

in speaking in English which is not in fact their first language. The 2nd Accused has admitted that he

is not particularly comfortable or well versed in speaking English, which amounts to his individual

speaking style and accent being much more so pronounced as opposed to comparing the samples of

persons whose style and manner of speaking would be easier to replicate. As in Archbold on

Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice 14-72, on Expert Evidence of Voice Identification by

personal characteristics, the advantage of expert evidence is that the expert can draw up an overall

profile of an individuals speech patterns, in which the significance of each parameter is assessed

individually, and which will be backed up with instrumental analysis and reference research.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 71 of 145

Additionally, admission of evidence of novel sciences for the purposes of identification is not

a foreign experience for Sri Lankan Courts. For instance, the leading of evidence as to identification

through DNA typing and fingerprints in the Sajeewa Alias Ukkuwa and Others V. The Attorney-

General (Hokandara Case) (2004) 2 SLR 263 as early as 1999 made history as the first case to

consider DNA evidence in Sri Lanka. Thereafter, the use of DNA evidence as corroborative evidence

in the case of The Attorney-General V. Potta Naufer and Others (Ambepitiya Murder Case) (2007)

2 SLR 144, with extensive elaboration of the methodology and science supporting the use of DNA

typing, are both instances of leading expert evidence for the purposes of identification. Given the

technological advancement, especially with the use of personal devices as smartphones and

personal computers, the outlook on technological evidence must be altered significantly, making

room for modern realities which could not have been contemplated by legislators at the time of the

enactment of certain legislation effecting such evidence. It is evident that the evolution of

technology has outpaced the parallel development of law, and oft it has been demonstrated in cases

as the above, that practical necessity being demonstrated in cases, leads to the opinions of courts

preceding and influencing eventual legislative amendments encompassing such opinions.

The identification of individuals, earlier being a selected few methods has undeniably advanced

during the current millennia. For instance, the development of biometric technology for

identification, including methods as facial and retinal recognition, have drastically increased in

accuracy.

However, in terms of legal admissibility of evidence based on novel sciences, it is entirely dependent

on factors that include those considered above and is undeniably subjective to each individual

circumstance, the science concerned, the specific methodology used, and the error margin involved.

In the instant case, applying all the above tests and taking the expert evidence into account, with

due regard to the methodology used in this specific circumstance, we find that Voice Analysis in

the manner conducted by Witness Gunathilake, is in fact a Science which falls under Section 45 of

the Evidence Ordinance.

Was it correct for the trial court to have concluded that Witness Gunathilake of the Government

Analyst Department was an Expert on Voice Identification for the purposes of S.45 of the

Evidence Ordinance?

In considering the question of whether Witness Gunathilake is an expert in the field of Voice

Identification, her credentials which have been admitted during the examination of the witness

before the High court are noteworthy.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 72 of 145 She has performed over sixty voice analysis and issued Analyst Reports for similar purposes albeit

never having testified before court prior to this occasion. She was functioning in the capacity of

Assistant Government Examiner of Questioned Documents and had listed her basic qualifications. In

respect of qualifications in the area of Forensic Audio Analysis, she has specialized in this area during

the training she received through a project conducted by KOICA Institute (Korea International

Cooperation Agency) through which she has participated in a training conducted by four senior

scientists at the National Forensic Service (NFS) situated in Wongju, South Korea. Thereafter, a

further training was provided on her return to Sri Lanka. The witness explains that the equipment

required for this form of testing was donated by KOICA and that she is the most senior officer in

regard to Audio Forensic Analysis in her Department and has provided reports since 2017.

In terms of who may qualify as an expert, the High Court has relied on the definition provided by

Blacks Law Dictionary as

Someone who, through education or experience, has developed skill of knowledge in a

particular subject, so that he or she may form an opinion that will assist the fact finder

And expert evidence as provided by the same source is as follows:

Evidence about a scientific, technical, professional or other specialized issue given by a

person qualified to testify because of familiarity with the subject or special training in the

field

In the case of Charles Perera V. Motha 65 NLR 294 Hon. Basnayake, C. J. expressed his opinion on

the expert witnesses to the effect that:

The standing of the expert, his skill and experience, the amount and nature of the materials

available for comparison, the care and discrimination with which he has approached the

question on which he is expressing his opinion, the extent to which he has called in aid the

advances of modern science to demonstrate to the Court the soundness of his opinion, are

all matters which will assist the Court in assessing the weight to be attached to the fact of

his opinion. The cross-examination of the " expert " by the opposing side, where it is properly

directed, would also assist the Court in determining what weight it should attach to the fact

declared relevant by section 45.

Additionally, in cases such as Solicitor General V. Fernando 1965 67 NLR 159 it was

considered that the precise character of the question upon which expert evidence is required has to

be taken into account when deciding whether the qualifications of a person entitles him to be

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 73 of 145 regarded as a competent expert. In the situation at hand given that the witness is the expert on

Audio Analysis in Sri Lanka and the character of the question pertains to Voice Identification, which

is an area she has received special training in, she qualifies as an expert in the instant case on the

questions directed to her.

Her credibility is in no way affected by the lack of previous appearances before a court of

law. As considered in Mitharadasa Fernando V. S.I of Police, Kalubowila 1961 63 NLR 422. The fact

that a person has provided evidence as an expert 250 instances prior, does not qualify him as an

expert in the subject matter. Further, as per Stork I.P Vs. Perera (1948) 38 C.L.W 80, once the

necessary degree of skill is conceded it does not matter how seldom that skill has been displayed in

the witness box. Accordingly, the real expertise, training and methodology utilized by the witness is

of more important than the number of times a person may or may not have testified before court.

This was considered in the field of Voice Identification in the US 7th Circuit Court in US V. Smith 869

F,2d 348 (7th Cir.1989), in leading evidence of an expert who had not previously testified as a voice

identification expert in a court of law.

The expert evidence of novel sciences is a question posed to Courts even during cases as Singho

Appu V. The King (Supra) in which expert evidence was led regarding footprints, Hon Howard, C.J,

considered that;

Here again the testimony against the accused did not rest solely on the evidence of foot-

prints it would appear that the learned Judge in the present case was entitled to construe

the words science or art so widely as to include within its ambit the testimony of a

person who had studied foot-prints. If he was satisfied that such person was capable of

distinguishing and identifying foot-prints, he was also entitled to rely on his testimony

In such cases, it was made apparent that in addition to the wider construction of Section 45,

evidence of such science or art can be admitted if the Court is satisfied that the person testifying

regarding the same is a person capable of distinguishing and identifying matters of such nature,

Applying the same to the instant case, in perusing the material before this court I find that the

Witness has received requisite training and is competent in the field in which she professes to be an

expert and she has continually practiced the same in previous instances albeit never having testified

before court on the same. The witness has provided extensive and clear answers to the questions

posed to her in her area of expertise in addition to a clear report of her investigation. She has

expressed the basis of her having formed opinions with direct reference to the methodologies

utilized by her in the conduct of her investigation. Further, she has not hesitated in answering with

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 74 of 145 clarity of the instances she could not deduce any matter with certainty. The witness has maintained

a professional demeanor, standing firmly in cross examination and has presented her opinion with

great confidence in an unwavering manner. The cross examination has not revealed any matters

fatal to her findings nor refuted her position through other expert evidence.

For the reasons stated hereinbefore we hold that it is correct for the trial court to have concluded

that witness Gunathilake of the Government Analyst Department is an Expert on Voice

Identification for the purposes of S.45 of the Evidence Ordinance.

What amounts to Safe Custody as per Section 4 (1)(d) of the Evidence (Special provisions) Act?

Were the Voice recordings in Safe custody, when the recorded conversations were in a mobile

phone, which was in the custody of the virtual Complainant? Has the fact that the voice recordings

were in the custody of the Virtual Complainant, resulted in the recordings becoming inadmissible?

Information stored on digital devices can pose a number of evidential issues for the courts. This is

largely given that rules of evidence contained in the Evidence Ordinance evolved long before the

advent of modern electronic equipment and computers, and those rules have not always proved

adaptable to evidence emanating from such modern devices. This has necessitated the introduction

of legislation with a view of facilitating the proper use of such evidence. The Evidence (Special

Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995 has been enacted in Sri Lanka to provide for the admissibility of

audio-visual recordings, and of information contained in statements produced by computers in civil

and criminal proceedings.

Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance has confined its definition of evidence to oral and

documentary evidence. However, despite the non-inclusion of real evidence within the

definition of evidence in Section 3, our courts have admitted real evidence also. The

introduction of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995, has now enabled a party

to produce in any proceeding where direct oral evidence of a fact would be admissible, any

contemporaneous recording or reproduction thereof. (Section 4 (1) of the Act).

Section 4 (1)(d) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act reads as follows,

In any proceeding where direct oral evidence of a fact would be admissible, any

contemporaneous recording reproduction thereof, tending to establish that fact shall be

admissible as evidence of that fact. If it is shown that-

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 75 of 145

a) ..

b) ..

c) ..

d) the recording or reproduction was not altered or tampered with in any manner

whatsoever during or after the making of such recording or reproduction, or that it

was kept in safe custody at all material times, during or after the making of such

recording or reproduction and that sufficient precautions were taken to prevent the

possibility of such recording or reproduction being altered or tampered with, during

the period in which It was in such custody.

(Emphasis added)

There was no dispute that the voice recordings relevant to the instant case is a contemporaneous

recording in terms of Section 4(1) of the Act. This is presumably because the said voice recording

was recorded using a mobile phone.

The main thrust of the arguments put forward by the Accused Appellants is whether the voice

recordings were in safe custody while in the possession of the Virtual Complainant. Section 4(1)(d)

of the Act (above mentioned) is relevant in this regard.

Safe Custody is the safekeeping of important documents and valuables, in the instant case, the voice

recordings. It is important to maintain the chain of custody to preserve the integrity of the evidence

and prevent it from contamination, which can alter the state of the evidence. If not preserved, the

evidence presented in Court might be challenged and ruled inadmissible. The chain of custody in

digital forensics can also be referred to as the forensic link, the paper trail, or the chronological

documentation of electronic evidence. It indicates the collection, sequence of control, transfer, and

analysis. It also documents each person who handled the evidence, the date/time it was collected or

transferred, and the purpose for the transfer.

In order to preserve digital evidence, the chain of custody should span from the first point of data

collection, through examination, analysis, reporting, and the time of presentation to the Courts. This

is necessary to avoid the possibility of any suggestion that the evidence has been altered or

tampered with, in any manner. While it may have been handled correctly during the forensic

process, if the evidence is then handed to the Court in a way that then leaves it open to alteration,

perhaps by altering the timestamps or metadata associated, it may then be damaged. Hence it is

important to establish that the recordings were in safe custody at all material times and that

sufficient precautions were taken to prevent even a mere possibility of tampering in order to ensure

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 76 of 145 the authenticity of the recordings. In the instant case, the chain of custody pertaining to the persons

in whose possession the evidence was kept, it can be observed that the chain of custody has not

been broken as the recordings were constantly in possession of the Complainant until it was handed

over to the Government Analyst and there have been no third-party interferences.

The Virtual Complainant has recorded multiple telephone conversations which had taken place

between the 1st and 2nd Accused-Appellant and himself during the years 2017-2018 on his two

mobile phones (iPhone 6 and iPhone 7). The issue raised by the Accused Appellants is that the

alleged mobile phones used to record the conversations had not been tendered to the investigators

and that the Complainant traveled to Bangalore, India with the mobile phones in his possession.

Therefore, the Accused Appellants argue that they were not in safe custody when they were in the

possession of the Virtual Complainant.

As per the Complainants explanation, this was because he was a businessman and needed the use

of the said mobile phones for his day-to-day activities. The Complainant admits that he did not hand

over the said mobile phones to the investigators but had directly handed them over to the

Government Analyst much later. In the meantime, he had traveled to India several times while

possessing mobile phones in his custody and had copied all the recordings onto his computer in

Bangalore. He further admits that he had retained custody of the phones for 5 days before the

recordings made on 23/02/2018 were copied to the computers of the investigators and for over 5

months before the recordings made on 05/09/2017 were copied to the computers of the

investigators.

As per the evidence submitted, the Accused Appellant argue that the said mobile phones had been

handed over temporarily to the Government Analyst much later on 17/05/2018 and the same was

not sealed. It is the contention of the Accused Appellant that the Complainant had ample

opportunity to tamper with them prior to handing them over to the Government Analyst.

However, in the Indian case of S. Pratap Singh V. State of Punjab, AIR 1964 SC 72, it was held that,

tape recorded talks are admissible in evidence and the simple fact that such type of evidence can be

easily tampered with certainly could not be a ground to reject such evidence as inadmissible or

refuse to consider it, because there are few documents and possibly no piece of evidence, which

could not be tampered with.

The Accused relying on Indian Law further argues that the fact that the recordings were not sealed

naturally gives rise to the argument that the recording medium might have been tampered with

before it was replayed.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 77 of 145 In the Court of Appeal case Abeyagunawardane V. Samoon and Others [2007] 1 Sri L.R the video

cassette lay for two years in a dark room, which was not padlocked, nor the envelope that contained

the video cassette sealed, as in the case of other productions, and accessible to many others. Hon.

Imam J stated that,

The evidence of P.S. Karunathilaka in my view clearly establishes that the requirements as

set out in section 4(1)(d) of the aforesaid Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995

were not complied with. Section 4(2) of the aforesaid Act makes it clear that the video

cassette could be admissible in evidence only if the conditions set out in section 4(1) are

satisfied.

In the above case, it was decided that the video cassette was not admissible as it did not satisfy the

requirements set out in Section 4(1)(d) as it was easily accessible to anyone for two whole years and

thus could have been tampered with. However, in the instant case, although the devices were not

sealed when it was handed over to the Government Analyst, the recordings were on the personal

mobile phones of the Complainant. As such, the circumstances of the instant case differ from that of

the aforementioned case as it was always on his person even when he traveled to India and was

never left unattended unlike in the case of Abeyagunawardane.

Furthermore, the Complainant had established the fact that the two mobile phones were secured

with Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) only known to him and it was only he who had access to

the phones. In mobile devices, the PIN acts as a password preventing persons from gaining

unauthorized access to a personal device. This is a numeric code that must be entered each time the

device is started. Unlike a video cassette, a mobile phone is much more advanced in technology and

has many security features such as PIN codes or biometric scanners which prevents unauthorized

access.

Due to the development of security countermeasures in personal devices, such as smartphones are

no longer easily accessible to outsiders. As per Paul Bischoff, who is privacy advocate at

Comparitech, iPhones are considered to have a highly secure operating system. Disk encryption is

enabled by default, apps from the App Store go through a stricter vetting process, and Apple does

not gather users personal details for advertising purposes. Hence, third party access through

hacking or malware is minimal in the devices used by the Complainant.

In the instant case, it is vital to establish that the recording or reproduction was not altered or

tampered with in any manner whatsoever during or after the making of such recording or

reproduction, or that it was kept in safe custody at all material times, during or after the making of

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 78 of 145 such recording or reproduction and that sufficient precautions were taken to prevent the possibility

of such recording or reproduction being altered or tampered with, during the period in which it was

in such custody.

As per the testimony of the expert witness Gunathilake, they have subjected the recordings to an

initial investigation. She further pointed out that they did not subject the recordings to an

authenticity analysis as they were not requested to do so. However, upon the initial investigation

they were able to identify that they were not computer-generated voices thus, there was no need to

go for an authenticity analysis.

However, they did subject the said recordings to a process of Critical Listening. This involves a

thorough breakdown of both foreground and background sounds through repetitive listening. They

had scanned the recordings to identify any viruses, then made a duplicate copy of it to work with, in

order not to harm the original file. During the initial investigation of the copy, they first identify

whether the voices on the recording are computer generated voices. Next, they pay attention to the

background noises to see if there have been any changes to the background or if the flow of the

conversation has changed. During this process they had listened to recordings repeatedly in order to

identify if there has been any editing done to the recording, during which they had not identified

any discrepancies. It is submitted that on a preliminary basis there were no indications of alteration

shedding doubt on the authenticity of the recordings that would have indicated the need for an

Authentication Analysis.

Upon being questioned on whether any mimicry of voices can be identified during the initial

investigation, witness Gunathilake explained that only the tone we hear will be different. No matter

how hard a person tries to change their voice only the basic pitch can be changed, and the person

can still be identified through the process utilized for identification and on the above basis it was

observed that the recordings have not been altered or tampered with.

On a secondary level, the Accused-Appellants argue that the presence of a modified date on the

properties of the said recordings show that they have been modified by the Complainant. As per

witness Gunathilake, what appears as the date modified means the last date the file has been

modified or the content of the file has been changed. This can be changed or edited by anyone and

therefore cannot be considered during a forensic investigation. As she further explained, the date

modified can change due to saving the file after any small changes done to it or if the file is copied

as a VCD then both the modified date and created date will change to the date it was created. This

can even change if one copies the file to a laptop, in which event the date of the file may change to

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 79 of 145 the date and time of the operating system on the laptop. Therefore, as per witness Gunathilake, the

date modified cannot be relied on in identifying whether the file has been tampered with.

Thirdly, the Accused Appellants relying on the testimony of witness Gunathilake, argued that the

voice recordings may have been tampered with even before they were handed over to the

Government Analyst Department.

As witness Gunathilake explained, a more accurate and scientific form of investigating any

tampering or alteration of the voice recordings is by analyzing the Hash Value of the recordings.

Hash value is an algorithm which is unique to each file and is used to identify the files. Hash values

can be thought of as fingerprints for files. The contents of a file are processed through a

cryptographic algorithm, and a unique numerical value (the hash value) is produced that identifies

the contents of the file. If the contents are modified in any way, the hash value will also change

significantly. Of the many varieties of hash values available, the varieties used in the immediate

investigation are MD.05 (Message Digest 5) and SHA 01 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1).

As every file on a computer is, ultimately, just data that can be represented in binary form, a

hashing algorithm can take that data and run a complex calculation on it and output a fixed-length

string as the result of the calculation. The result is the files hash value or message digest. Since

hashes cannot be reversed, simply knowing the result of a files hash from a hashing algorithm does

not allow a person to reconstruct the files contents. However, it does allow to determine whether

two files are identical or not without knowing anything about their contents.

As witness Gunathilake explained, she cannot confirm that the hash value of the original recording

and the hash value of the recording given to her are the same. In the event the recording had been

altered with before she received it, she would not have the original hash value. However, what she

can confirm is that the hash value of the recording given to her, and the hash value of the recording

played in Court are the same. Thus, it can be proved that the recordings have not been tampered

with during that specific period of time, however, it is not a fact that can serve to establish

genuineness nor tampering of any form.

Due to the above reasons explained, this Court believes that the mobile phones were in safe

custody while they were in the custody of the Virtual Complainant.

Additionally, the Accused Appellants had raised objections with regard to the application of Section

7(1) of the Act. Section 7(1) reads as follows;

The following provisions shall apply where any party to a proceeding proposes to tender any

evidence under section 4 or 5, in such proceeding-

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 80 of 145

(a) the party proposing to tender such evidence shall, not later than forty-five days before the

date fixed for inquiry or trial file, or cause to be filed, in court, after notice to the opposing

party, a list of such evidence as is proposed to be tendered by that party, together with a

copy of such evidence or such particulars thereof as is sufficient to enable the party to

understand the nature of the evidence;

(b) any party to whom a notice has been given under the preceding provision may, within

fifteen days of the receipt or such notice apply to the party giving such notice, to be

permitted access to

At the time of the commencement of the trial, the accused had requested access to the two

iPhones, which were used by the Complainant to record the conversations. With the

commencement of the prosecution the Court has allowed both Accused Appellants to inspect the

two mobile phones of the Complainant. (Both Accused have challenged the voice recordings on the

ground that they were not kept in safe custody and that the Prosecution has not excluded the

possibility of tampering. Therefore, they contended that it was dangerous to rely on such

recordings).

However, as observed by the High Court, the said request for access to the mobile phones were

made only on 09/09/2019, which was not within the stipulated period of 15 days. Though the

opportunity was granted, the Accused Appellants did not inspect the devices and informed that the

given time was not sufficient to employ the services of an expert. The Court had granted further

time to have access to the phones on 18/09/2019 and on 20/09/2019. However, the 1st Accused

Appellant particularly had failed to lead the evidence of his expert who inspected the two phones

and the 2nd Accused Appellant did not even utilize the opportunity given to him by the Court to

inspect the two phones. Therefore, the Accused Appellants cannot rely on non-compliance with

Section 7 to question the integrity of the recordings.

Finally, in the question of whether the fact of the recordings being in the custody of the Virtual

Complainant has resulted in them becoming inadmissible. In the instant case, when dealing with the

question of admissibility, the High Court has stated that it used the voice recordings found in the

mobile phones only to the limited extent of identifying the voices of the parties involved. However,

as discussed above, as the recordings have been in safe custody while in possession of the

Complainant, the recordings can be used as evidence to prove that the conversations actually took

place and the incidents discussed happened in reality (further proved by the CCTV recordings

submitted). Additionally, during cross examination and through independent evidence led to this

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 81 of 145 effect, it became an admitted/proved fact that the relevant conversations and incidents had indeed

taken place. This is simply, corroborated by the scientific and technical evidence discussed above.

Finally, as per Section 167 of the Evidence Ordinance,

The improper admission or rejection of evidence shall not be ground of itself for a new

trial or reversal of any decisions in any case, if it shall appear to the court before

which such objection is raised that, independently of the evidence objected to and

admitted, there was sufficient evidence to justify the decision, or that, if the rejected

evidence had been received, it ought not to have varied the decision.

It is the opinion of this court that the conviction of the accused is based on sufficient evidence

beyond the voice recordings. Indeed, the recordings serve as corroborative evidence

supporting the conviction, however, exclusion of the same would not have amounted to any

substantial variation of the decision.

Therefore, after carefully observing all the evidence at hand, this Court believes that the voice

recordings which were in the mobile phones of the Virtual Complainant were in safe custody as per

Section 4(1)(d) and are therefore admissible.

Were the two Accused-Appellants entrapped to commit the offence they have been convicted of,

and if so, have they been deprived of a fair trial?

As has already been mentioned above, the virtual complainant had met ASP Ruwan Kumara of

CIABOC after he had received a telephone call. Upon the virtual complainant's arrival in his office at

CIABOC, ASP Ruwan Kumara had advised him to submit a written complaint regarding the matter.

Thus, ASP Ruwan Kumara after listening to the oral account narrated by the virtual complainant,

sent the virtual complainant back to submit a written complaint, without proceeding to

record/reduce the statement into writing. Thereafter, the virtual complainant had lodged a

complaint on 15th February 2018 and CIABOC had proceeded to record a statement from him on 22

February 2018. As has been mentioned before, the investigators then informed him that the

available material is not sufficient to warrant an arrest. As the virtual complainant informed CIABOC

that he no longer had contact with either Accused Appellant at that point in time, the Investigators

had instructed the virtual complainant to renew his communication line with the Accused

Appellants. It is the submission of the Accused Appellants that this procedure amounts entrapment

of the Accused Appellants at the instance of the officers of CIABOC.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 82 of 145 Learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Accused-Appellant vehemently relied on Sorrells V. United

States 287 US 435 (1932). In that case the term entrapment has been defined as follows: the

conception and planning of an offence by an officer and his procurement of its commission by one

who would not have perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the officer . It

can be seen from the above definition that any defence of entrapment would pre-suppose that the

accused person who takes up such defence admits commission of the offending act. It is then only

such accused person can assert that he/she would not have committed it in the absence of any

trickery, persuasion or fraud of the officer. Let us see whether there was trickery, persuasion or

fraud on the part of the CIABOC officers.

When the virtual complainant had received a telephone call from ASP Ruwan Kumara of CIABOC he

went on his own volition. It was not his position that he was coerced by any officer of CIABOC to

make a complaint against the Accused Appellants. When ASP Ruwan Kumara requested the virtual

complainant to submit a written complaint, the virtual complainant could have waited without

submitting such statement in writing. Thereafter, the virtual complainant could well have waited

without proceeding to CIABOC which led to his statement being recorded on 22 February 2018.

When the virtual complainant was informed by CIABOC to renew his communication line with the

Accused Appellants the virtual complainant could have waited without implementing that advise. It

was not his position that he was lured by any officer of CIABOC to make a complaint against the

Accused Appellants. It is also not the position of the Accused Appellants that they would not have

perpetrated this crime if not for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the CIABOC officers. The

defence of the Accused Appellants is that they did not commit this crime. Then whose position is

this? It is only an argument put forward by the learned counsel for the Accused Appellants in the

course the hearing of this appeal inviting Court to hold in this case that the officers of CIABOC have

entrapped the Accused Appellants. We are unable to see any merit in this argument.

Moreover, if it is the position of the Accused Appellants that they would not have perpetrated this

crime if not for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the CIABOC officers, that would necessarily be

within their exclusive knowledge. Thus, in such circumstances, section 106 of the Evidence

Ordinance to wit: When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of

proving that fact is upon him shall apply. Even if one is to argue that the above is a special

circumstance (not provided by statutory law but as per some law), then too, section 105 of the

Evidence Ordinance would apply and the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing

the case within such special circumstance is upon the Accused Appellants. The Accused Appellants in

the instant case have not even attempted to discharge such burden.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 83 of 145 We need to be mindful that Police officers day in and day out, lay traps to detect criminals in action.

This happens in cases involving possession and trafficking of dangerous drugs, bribery and

corruption, gambling, prostitutions, raids carried out by authorized officers under Food Act and even

price control cases. That is a long-standing practice happening from time immemorial not only in

this country but in every part of the civilized world. While it is not an unlawful method of detecting

crimes, the learned Presidents Counsel also did not seek to argue that those trap cases come under

entrapment. This can be clearly seen from the following quotation relied upon by the learned

Presidents Counsel from the judgment of Justice Panchapakesa Ayyar in M.S. Mohiddin V.

Unknown [AIR 1952 Mad 561]:

I have held in several cases already that there are two kinds of traps a legitimate trap,

where the offence has already been born and is in its course, and an illegitimate trap,

where the offence has not yet been born and a temptation is offered to see whether an

offence would be committed, succumbing to it, or not. Thus, where the bribe has already

been demanded from a man, and the man goes out offering to bring the money but goes

to the police and the magistrate and brings them to witness the payment, it will be a

legitimate trap, wholly laudable and admirable, and adopted in every civilized country

without the least criticism by any honest man. But, where a man has not demanded a

bribe, and he is only suspected to be in the habit of taking bribes, and he is tempted with a

bribe; just to see whether he would accept it or not and to trap him; if he accepts it, will be

an illegitimate trap and, unless authorized by an Act of Parliament, it will be an offence on

the part of the persons taking part in the trap who -will all be accomplices whose

evidence will have to be corroborated by untainted evidence to a smaller or larger extent as

the case may be before a conviction can be had under a rule of Court which has ripened

almost to a rule of law. But, in the case of a legitimate trap, the officers taking part in the

trap, like P.Ws 9 to 11, and the witnesses to the trap, like P.W. 8 would in no sense be

accomplices and their evidence will not require under the law, to be corroborated as a

condition precedent for conviction though the usual rule of prudence will require the

evidence to be scrutinized carefully and accepted as true before a conviction can be had.

(Emphasize is ours).

In the instant case, what had happened is not anything more than the virtual complainant going out

offering to bring the money after the Accused Appellants solicited the bribe from him but goes to

the CIABOC and brings CIABOC officers to witness the payment. Thus, even in terms of the above

case cited by the learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Accused Appellant, the trap in the instant

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 84 of 145 case would be a legitimate trap, which is wholly laudable and admirable, and adopted in every

civilized country without the least criticism by any honest man. It is not an entrapment.

Moreover, Entrapment as a defence is not part of our criminal justice system. Even if one resorts to

section 100 of the Evidence Ordinance, the position would be the same. Section 100 of the

Evidence Ordinance is as follows:

Whenever in a judicial proceeding a question of evidence arises not provided for by this

Ordinance or by any other law in force in Sri Lanka, such question shall be determined in

accordance with the English Law of Evidence for the time being.

In R. Vs. Sang, [(1980) AC 402], the House of Lords held that Entrapment is not a defence in English

Law. Thus, it would further confirm the earlier position we have already taken that even through the

window provided for in section 100, Entrapment is not a defence in our criminal justice system.

Furthermore, in Rajapakse V Fernando (52 NLR 361), Mr. Chitty's first submission was that while

Courts have to look to the Evidence Ordinance in regard to questions of evidence, nevertheless, it is

incorrect to say that the principles of '' Public Policy '' do not form part of our law. Mr. Chitty

contended in that case that the power is inherent in the Courts of Justice when it is faced with, what

he called, conduct which is contrary to public morality or fair dealing. In such a scenario, Mr. Chitty

contended that the Courts, despite the strict rules of evidence, must apply such principles of public

policy, and hold that the admission of such evidence would cause greater harm than its rejection,

and refuse to receive such evidence. However, Dias SPJs views stated in that case, could be

discernible from following excerpts taken from that judgment. They are as follows:

With this submission I am unable to agree. It will be observed that Mr. Chitty has been

unable to quote a single authority in support of his proposition. What authority there is

appears to be against him.

What Mr. Chitty is inviting us to do now is precisely what Wood Renton C J. pointed out a

Court of Justice could not and must not do, namely, to expand the law of evidence by

importing into it certain grounds of public policy to control or modify the statutory rules of

evidence laid down by the Evidence Ordinance. This we cannot do as we possess no

legislative powers. An examination of the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance shows that

the Legislature when drafting the Evidence Ordinance had ". public policy " in mind, and

legislated in order to give effect to the principles of " public policy " of the kind Mr. Chitty

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 85 of 145

refers to in certain cases. Thus the admission of confessions against persons accused of

crimes was confined within very strict limits. The rules of evidence relating to privilege and

the admission of privileged communications is another example of the Legislature giving

effect to certain principles of public policy. The prohibition that the prisoner's spouse should

be called as a witness for the prosecution save in very exceptional cases furnishes another

example. I am, therefore, unable to agree with Mr. Chitty that, over and above this, there

exists a nebulous and undefined residual power in the Courts to admit or reject admissible

evidence brought before it by legally competent and compellable witnesses on grounds of

"public policy". Section 100 of the Evidence Ordinance provides that in the case of any casus

omissus we are to have recourse, not to Scottish or American law, but to the principles of the

English law alone. As I have pointed out, under English Law, relevant evidence which has

been obtained improperly is not rendered inadmissible on that ground alone. ..

..Mr. Chitty next argued that altogether apart from the question of public policy, there is

another principle of law that an accused person should not be compelled to give or furnish

evidence against himself. I agree that it would be immoral and undesirable that agents

provocateur and others should tempt or abet persons to commit offences ; but it is a

question whether it is open to a Court to acquit such persons where the offence is proved, on

the sole ground that the evidence was procured by unfair means. Such considerations may

induce the trial Judge ' to disbelieve the evidence, but such evidence is not inadmissible, and,

therefore, when the offence charged has been proved, it is the duty of the Judge to convict.

..

The above excerpts are self-explanatory and hence we would not delve on any further discussion on

this matter. Therefore, we reject the argument advanced by the Accused Appellants that they have

been deprived of a fair trial as the officers of CIABOC have entrapped the Accused Appellants in this

case.

In view of the alleged infirmities in the testimony given by the virtual Complainant, can credibility

and testimonial trustworthiness be attached to his testimony?

Did the virtual Complainant have a motive to falsely implicate the Accused?

Did the two Accused Appellants possess any motive to solicit and or accept a bribe as narrated by

the virtual complainant?

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 86 of 145

As already referred to above in this judgment, the instant case is based on an investigation

commenced by the officers of CIABOC upon a complaint of alleged solicitation of a bribe by two

senior Public Servants. The said complaint was investigated by a team of officers from CIABOC and

the two Accused-Appellants were arrested at the point of accepting a bribe of Rupees twenty

million. The fact that the two Accused-Appellants came to the Coffee-shop of Hotel Taj Samudra and

met with the virtual Complainant as pre-arranged by them and the fact that they had some

refreshments at the expense of the virtual Complainant is undisputed. The video footages obtained

from the Hotel CCTV system confirms this fact. Subsequent to the meeting at the Coffee-shop, all

three persons, including the virtual Complainant, the two Accused-Appellants, walked towards the

car park. When the car belonging to the virtual Complainant reached them, the 1st Accused-

Appellant had got into the rear seat of the said car from the Drivers side, and was seated inside the

car with two bags, containing Rs. 20 million when the officers of the CIABOC came to the place. The

2nd Accused-Appellant who accompanied the 1st Accused-Appellant to the car park was watching the

transaction when he was arrested by the CIABOC officers.

It is also admitted by the 2nd Accused-Appellant that he met the virtual Complainant on 05.09 2017

at the Waters Edge Restaurant. The meeting between the two Accused-Appellants and the virtual

Complainant on 27.02.2018 at the office of the 2nd Accused-Appellant and on 28.04.2018 at Bread

talk Restaurant was admitted by all parties including the two Accused-Appellants. Even though the

1st Accused-Appellant denies his meeting with the virtual Complainant on 17.05.2017 at Royal Boat

Restaurant, he too had admitted meeting the virtual Complainant at his office somewhere in August

2016 after signing the shareholders agreement. It is also an admitted fact before the High Court at

Bar, that the virtual Complainant representing Sri Prabhulingeshvar Sugars had submitted the

unsolicited proposal for a joint venture between the Government of Sri Lanka and the said company

to manage Kanthale Sugar Factory in early 2015 and in fact a cabinet paper was submitted by the

late Minister of Lands seeking approval for the above proposal.

The virtual complainant complains of a long delay in giving effect to the unsolicited proposal he

made and alleges that the 1st Accused-Appellant being the key person who is responsible for giving

effect to the cabinet approval, had purposely delayed the implementation since the virtual

complainant did not agree to pay him US $ 300000 as a bribe.

Since the case for the prosecution was solely dependent on the evidence of Nagarajah (the virtual

complainant), it was submitted on behalf of the Accused-Appellants that it is unsafe to act on the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 87 of 145 evidence of the sole witness who cannot be considered as an innocent person but was a dubious

investor. In his evidence before the High Court at Bar, the virtual complainant took up the position

that he recorded several conversations between him and the two Accused-Appellants and that he

did not modify the recordings until the two phones were handed over to the Government Analyst

for examination.

However, it was argued on behalf of the Accused-Appellants that the presence of a modified date

on the properties that were examined by the Government Analyst creates a doubt on the evidence

of the virtual Complainant and therefore his evidence cannot be acted upon or in other words, the

virtual Complainant had lied before the High Court at Bar when he said that he did not interfere

with the recorded evidence.

In those circumstances, on behalf of the 1st Accused-Appellant, it was submitted that the Court

should advert to the principle of indivisibility of credibility

In this regard, the 1st Accused-Appellant relied on several appellate Court decisions including the

case of Queen V. Vellasamy 63 NLR 265 at 270.

As already referred to by us in this judgment, witness Gunathilake had explained her position with

regard to Modified data as the date modified can change due to saving the file after any small

change done to it or if the file is copied as a VCD- then both the modified date and created date will

change to the date it was created. This can even change if one copies the file to a laptop, in which

event the date of the file may change to the date and time of the operating system on the laptop.

Based on the above, witness Gunathilake took the view that the date modified cannot be relied on,

in identifying whether the file has been tampered with or not but she took the view that, the

recordings before her were subject to Critical Listening which involves a thorough breakdown of

both foreground and background sounds through repetitive listing and she could not identify any

editing done to the voice samples. Furthermore, we have already held that the voice recordings

which were in the mobile phones of the Virtual Complainant were in safe custody as per Section

4(1)(d) and are therefore admissible. we have already given extensive reasons in that regard.

In the light of the above conclusion and on the evidence of witness Gunathilake, it is not possible

for this Court to conclude that witness Nagarajah had lied before the High Court at Bar when he

denied making any modification to the recordings that were available in his two mobile phones.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 88 of 145 When advancing the above argument, the Accused-Appellants further contended that the same

principle of indivisibility of credibility applies when the prosecution decided to drop the 3rd charge in

the Indictment against the 2nd Accused-Appellant.

As already referred to in this judgment, the 3rd count in the Indictment referred to a solicitation of a

gratification of Rs. 540 million from the virtual complainant on or about 05.09.2017 by the 2nd

Accused-Appellant. When establishing charges against an accused person, it is the duty of the

prosecution to submit evidence to prove each and every charge. As submitted by the learned

counsel for the Respondents, even though witness Nagarajah had referred to a meeting with the 2nd

Accused-Appellant at Waters Edge Restaurant on 05.09.2017, he had not referred to a solicitation of

Rs. 540 million from him on that day.

In the absence of any other evidence to that effect, the prosecution had decided to drop the said

count but it cannot affect the credibility of the evidence of the virtual complainant.

As observed by this Court the above decision of the prosecution was solely on the non-availability of

evidence to establish the said count, but there is no material before court to conclude that the

virtual complainant had either lied or took up a different stand when giving evidence before the

High Court at Bar.

Even though the learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellants relied heavily on the principle of

indivisibility of credibility and submitted that witness cannot be both not credible and credible with

regard to the very same evidence and submitted that it is unsafe to act on the evidence of the

virtual Complainant, we see no reason to uphold such position for two reasons.

Firstly, the material already referred to above does not reveal that the evidence given by the virtual

complainant with regard to the said matters are contradictory in nature compelling the Court to

reject his evidence.

Secondly, our Courts have now adopted a more moderate view in following the principle of

indivisibility of credibility which is evident from several cases decided in the recent past including

the case of Sudu Aiya and Others V. The Attorney General 2005 1 Sri LR 358 at 377 where the

position of our Courts was discussed as follows;

Further, counsels submission that Ratnayake has given false evidence and by the

application of the maxim Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus his evidence should be rejected,

is also without merit. Other than a few contradictions and omissions which were not very

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 89 of 145

material, defence did not succeed in showing that witness Ratnayake had given false

evidence. In relation to this matter, errors of memory, faulty observations, and even

exaggerations must be distinguished from deliberate falsehood. Besides, this maxim has not

been applied as an absolute rule. It was observed in the case of Samaraweera vs. The

Attorney General that divisibility of evidence test is preferred under certain conditions. In

the case of Francis Appuhamy vs. The Queen T. S. Fernando J, in the course of his judgment

stated as follows: Certainly in this Country, it is not an uncommon experience to find in

criminal cases witnesses who, in addition to implicating a person actually seen by them

committing a crime, seek to implicate others who are either members of the family of that

person or enemies of such witnesses. In that situation the judge or jurors have to decide for

themselves whether that part of the testimony which is found to be false taints the whole or

whether the false can safely be separated from the true.

The virtual complainant is an Indian National who was engaged in business activities in Sri Lanka

since 2003. In 2011 when the Government of Sri Lanka called for international bids to recommence

the work in Kanthale Sugar Factory, he submitted a tender but he was not awarded the tender at

that time. However, the said process was subsequently cancelled by the Government and in the

year 2015 the virtual complainant had submitted an unsolicited offer for the same purpose through

Prabhulingeshvar Sugar and Chemicals Company, a leading Sugar Manufacturer in India.

Subsequent to the signing of the shareholders agreement in August 2016, the virtual complainant

had met the 1st Accused-Appellant at his office and during the said meeting the 1st Accused-

Appellant had solicited a gratification of 3 million USD to execute the project.

During this period 1st Accused-Appellant was directly involved in the implementation of the project

as the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands. As revealed from the evidence of the virtual complainant,

the 1st Accused-Appellant on another occasion had informed the virtual complainant that if he does

not pay him the solicited gratification, steps would be taken to dispose of the existing machinery

without giving it to the virtual complainant as per Article 7.9 of the Agreement. While the process

for disposing of the machinery was in progress, the 2nd Accused-Appellant had met the virtual

complainant and influenced him to resolve the dispute between the virtual complainant and the 1st

Accused-Appellant with regard to the machinery lying in the Sugar Factory premises.

Even though the virtual complainant had ignored various steps taken by the 1st Accused-Appellant

that delayed the implementation of the cabinet decision and the agreements signed between the

parties, the seriousness of the conduct of the 1st Accused-Appellant was realized by the virtual

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 90 of 145 complainant when the 1st Accused-Appellant advertised the sale of machinery at Kanthale Sugar

Factory.

As already revealed from the evidence of the virtual complainant, the investors had spent more

than 20 million USD by this time and therefore, he had decided to bring it to the notice of the Prime

Minister and met an officer of the Prime Ministers office and informed his grievance to the said

officer. Since there was a reference to a solicitation of a bribe, he was advised by the said officer to

lodge a complaint at the CIABOC.

However, the virtual complainant had not gone to CIABOC until he was requested to come by the

CIABOC. When he was asked to lodge a complaint by ASP Ruwan Kumara, his first reaction was that

he is not interested in taking legal action since he had come here to do business, but finally agreed

to submit a written complaint.

The above is the path in a nutshell which ended up with a complaint by witness Nagarajah with

CIABOC against the two Accused-Appellants. If he had the intention to falsely implicate the two

Accused-Appellants, he would not have waited so long to lodge a complaint against them. As

already referred to in this judgment, the Hon. Attorney General too had observed a long delay in

implementing certain decisions by the 1st Accused-Appellant but still, the virtual complainant was

following the routine procedure by making an appeal after appeal, until he realized that the things

have been moving away from the interest of the investor.

Learned Presidents Counsel on behalf of the two Accused-Appellants argued that the two Accused-

Appellants did not possess any motive to solicit and/or accept a bribe as narrated by the virtual

complainant.

In support of the above argument the followings were submitted on behalf of the 2nd Accused-

Appellant:

a) A copy of the shareholders agreement was not provided to him and he had to request for a

copy from the Finance Ministry in order to implement the provisions in the said agreement.

b) Later he had observed that certain provisions in the agreement were contradictory to the

advice given by the Hon. Attorney General.

c) In the said circumstances he had faced difficulties in implementing the provisions in the

agreement and therefore he had to obtain advice from the Hon. Attorney General on several

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 91 of 145

occasion, but he never delayed the process to scuttle the implementation of the

shareholders agreement.

At this point, I would like to look at Blacks Law Dictionary to ascertain the meaning of the term

motive. Black defines motive as, something esp. willful desire that lead one to Act (Blacks Law

Dictionary 8th edition) In the above context the motive entertained by the virtual complainant

should be for a wrongful purpose or in other words should have had malicious motive to falsely

implicate the Accused-Appellant.

It is observed by this Court that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) and the

Hon. Attorney General, both had observed the long delay in implementing the shareholders

agreement and the 1st Accused-Appellant had been repeatedly reminded by the said Cabinet

Committee to handover the land and report back to the Committee.

Similarly, the Hon. Attorney General too had observed in his letter addressed to the 1st Accused-

Appellant which was produced mark P-77 as follows:

As regards the releasing of lands to the investor, the modalities are expressly

provided in Article 17.1.1. of the Shareholders Agreement. There are no extraneous

conditions to be completed with when releasing the said land, and it is incumbent

upon the signatories to the said agreement to strictly abide by the provisions of the

said Articles. In view of the concerns expressed at the CCEM about the long delay,

this process should be completed expeditiously as possible.

When the Hon. Attorney General had reached a specific and conclusive opinion about the issues

raised by the 1st Accused-Appellant, as submitted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General before us,

the 1st Accused-Appellant had without any justification, turned again towards the secretary to His

Excellency the President writing the letter dated 07.08.2017 (P-82) seeking his intervention in the

process.

The next notable incident after writing P-82 was the intervention by the 2nd Accused-Appellant, and

the meeting the 2nd Accused-Appellant and Nagarajah had at Waters Edge Restaurant on

05.09.2017.

From the call record details produced before the High Court at Bar, it was the 2nd Accused-Appellant

who had given the first call to Nagarajah on 05.09.2017 around 11.42.52.a.m.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 92 of 145 Since then, the involvement of the 2nd Accused-Appellant is visible from the two CCTV footages

produced before Court with regard to the meetings at Bread Talk Restaurant and Taj Samundra

Hotel and the call records which show a similar pattern of calls taken between the virtual

complainant and the two Accused-Appellants.

When evaluating the above evidence, the High Court at Bar had correctly observed that the 1st

Accused-Appellant once retired from the office of the Secretary to the Ministry of Lands and

assumed duties as the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Secretariat, where he has no role to play in

Kanthale Sugar Factory Project, had still opted to continue the dealings with the virtual complainant

and admittedly met with him at Bread Talk Restaurant and Hotel Taj Samudra in order to discuss

and assist him in proceeding ahead with the project. If the 1st Accused-Appellant accompanied by

the 2nd Accused-Appellant, wanted to assist the virtual complainant in the said project, being senior

officers of the Government, they would obviously know that it is not the acceptable, prudent or

transparent way in dealing with the matters of this nature.

When considering the totality of the above material we have no hesitation in concluding that both

Accused-Appellants did possess the requisite motive for the solicitation and acceptance referred to

in the Indictment filed before the High Court at Bar.

As already observed by this court the virtual complainant being a foreigner who had come to Sri

Lanka to engage in business, and gone a considerable distance in the relevant investment by

spending and/or investing over 20 million USD. He had not been left with any other option, but to

seek some assistance from the higher authorities as he did. It was the version of the virtual

complainant that he never wanted/planned to get entangled with anybody in this manner but

simply wanted to focus on his business, but the circumstances had led for the final outcome of him

becoming the virtual complainant in this case.

In the light of this backdrop, this court concludes that the virtual complainant had simply acted as an

ordinary reasonable man who was confronted with a situation to which the solutions were beyond

his reach.

We have carefully considered all the arguments put forward before us by both parties. For the

foregoing reasons, we are unable to agree with the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel

for the Accused Appellants that the High Court at Bar has wrongly/unlawfully/unfairly conducted

the trial against their clients and wrongly convicted them. We hold that the High Court at Bar has

lawfully convicted both the Accused Appellants for the respective charges. We see no necessity for

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 93 of 145 our intervention in this conviction. Therefore, we proceed to affirm the conviction of both the

Accused Appellants for the respective charges as entered into by the High Court at Bar.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Accused Appellants also made submissions regarding the

sentences imposed on them by the High Court at Bar.

We have already mentioned before that both the Accused Appellants at the time they solicited and

accepted the bribes relevant to the instant case were holding very high posts in the highest echelons

of the Public Service of this country. The magnitude of the bribes they have solicited are

unimaginable. The purpose for which they were solicited no doubt shows that the Accused

Appellants while holding high positions of the Government had only worked for their unlawful and

immoral purposes while only helping the destruction of the countrys economy. We are of the view

that it would be difficult for this country to revive itself as long as high officers like the Accused

Appellants would hold such high offices in the Government. We therefore think that it would be

important to take into account the need to deter such public officers from being inclined to embark

on such unlawful endeavours.

In the case of The Attorney-General Vs. H. N. De Silva 57 NLR 121, Basnayake, A.C.J. (as he then

was) stated as follows:

In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a Judge should consider the

matter of sentence both from the point of view of the public and the offender. Judges are too often

prone to look at the question only from the angle of the offender. A Judge should, in determining

the proper sentence, first consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act

itself and should have regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under

which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent

and consider to what extent it will be effective. If the offender held a position of trust or belonged

to a service which enjoys the public confidence that must be taken into account in assessing the

punishment. The incidence of crimes of the nature of which the offender has been found to be

guilty and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should receive due consideration. The

reformation of the criminal, though no doubt an important consideration, is subordinate to the

others I have mentioned. Where the public interest or the welfare of the State (which are

synonymous) outweighs the previous good character, antecedents and age of the offender, public

interest must prevail.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 94 of 145 Sri Skanda Rajah J while citing with approval, the above passage from Basnayake, A.C.J.s judgment,

went ahead in the case of M. Gomes (S. I. Police, Crimes) Vs. W. V. D. Leelaratna 66 NLR 233, to

add three more grounds which a trial judge should consider in the assessment of the sentence to be

imposed on a convicted accused. Three of those additional grounds are firstly, the nature of the loss

to the victim and secondly, the profit that may accrue to the culprit in the event of non-detection

and thirdly, the use to which a stolen article could be put.

Perusal of the judgment of the High Court at Bar shows clearly, that it has been mindful of all the

relevant matters before passing the sentence imposed by it on the Accused Appellants. The

sentences imposed by the High Court at Bar are within the sentences the law has prescribed for the

relevant offences. We have no basis to disagree with the said sentences. We affirm the sentences

imposed on both the Accused Appellants by the High Court at Bar.

We proceed to dismiss the appeals of both the Accused Appellants.

Justice S. Thurairaja, PC,

JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 95 of 145 Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J

I have considered the draft judgment of my brother Judges Honourable Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda,

PC, Honourable Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya, Hon. Justice P. Padman Surasena and Hon. Justice S.

Thurairaja, PC. I am in agreement with their judgment, including their findings in respect of the

several questions of law raised during the hearing of this Appeal, and the conclusion reached that

this Appeal should be dismissed for the reasons contained in the said judgment. However, it is my

considered opinion that the following question of law raised by the Appellants is unique, extremely

important and therefore requires a detailed and an in-depth consideration. Therefore, I present this

judgment which contains reasons, conclusions and findings of my own regarding the following

question of law:

Were the two Appellants entrapped to commit the offences they have been convicted of, and if so,

have they been denied a fair trial?

Introduction

During the hearing of this Appeal, learned Presidents Counsel for both Appellants jointly raised a

novel and innovative question of law. Albeit brief, their position was that (i) both Appellants (more

particularly the 1st Appellant) had been entrapped to commit the offences which they had been

found guilty of having committed and convicted, (ii) the investigative technique referred to as

entrapment is obnoxious to law and hence illegal, (iii) presentation of evidence by the prosecution

at the trial arising out of such entrapment was contrary to law, and thus, (iv) the two Appellants had

been denied a fair trial. Therefore, learned counsel for the Appellants submitted that convictions of

both Appellants should be quashed and the Appeal should be allowed, as their Fundamental Right

guaranteed under Article 13(3) of the Constitution (which guarantees an accused a fair trial) had

been infringed. It was submitted on behalf of the 1st Appellant that the defence of entrapment was

raised on his behalf at the end of the trial in the Permanent High Court at Bar, which rejected the

said defence. They submitted that the rejection of the defence of entrapment was unlawful and

hence this Court should set-aside the finding of guilt pronounced by the Permanent High Court at

Bar. They urged that this ground of appeal was of such fundamental and critical importance, that

should this Court were to hold with the Appellants on this point, the conviction of the Accused -

Appellants should be set-aside and the Appellants should be acquitted while allowing this Appeal.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 96 of 145 Both learned Presidents Counsel emphasized that their arguments pertaining to this question of

law were being presented without prejudice to their other submissions which were based on the

footing that (i) the institution of criminal proceedings by the Director General of the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption was unlawful, (ii) the joinder of charges was

unlawful, in that there was a misjoinder, (iii) the testimony given by virtual complainant Nagarajah

was false and untrustworthy, (iv) the deferment of the decision pertaining to the admissibility of the

mobile telephone call recordings, till the end of the trial, was unlawful, (v) the Magistrate (during

the investigation stage) having directed the Appellants to give voice samples to the Government

Analyst was in violation of the rule against self-incrimination and was thus unlawful, and (vi) the

prosecution had failed to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.

Both learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellants as well as the learned Deputy Solicitor General

who appeared for the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC)

submitted that this was the first instance where the defence of entrapment had been raised in a

criminal appeal in Sri Lanka. Therefore, in my opinion, there exists a compelling need to consider

this matter very carefully and at considerable length.

Submissions of learned Counsel

Submissions on behalf of the 1st Appellant

Citing the judgment of Justice Rehnquist in United States v. Russell (411 US 423), learned

Presidents Counsel for the 1st Appellant drew the attention of this Court to the following quotation:

that the fact that officers or employees of the Government merely afford opportunities or

facilities for the commission of the offence does not defeat the prosecution. Nor will the

mere fact of deceit defeat the prosecution. For there are circumstances when the use of

deceit is the only practicable law enforcement technique available. It is only when the

Governments deception actually implants the criminal design in the mind of the Defendant

that the defence of entrapment come into play. [Emphasis added]

Citing certain principles contained in the judgment of the House of Lords in R v. Looseley, learned

Presidents Counsel submitted that in English law, while entrapment is not a substantive defence to

criminal liability, it has been held that nevertheless, it is unacceptable for the State, through its

agents to lure and entrap its citizens into committing crimes and then prosecute them for their

criminal conduct. To allow such prosecutions to take place would be to condone the abuse of its

power by the Executive and compromise the integrity of the criminal justice system. Permitting

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 97 of 145 entrapment would result in an abuse of the process of court and possibly lead to a violation of

Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). (Learned Presidents Counsel drew

parallels between Article 6 of the ECHR and Article 13(3) of the Constitution of the Democratic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, which guarantee inter-alia the right to a fair trial.) Therefore,

prosecutions based on entrapment should be stayed as it would amount to an abuse of process. It is

necessary to balance the competing requirements that those who commit crimes should be

convicted and punished, and that there should not be an abuse of process which would constitute

an affront to public conscience.

Learned counsel submitted that even though an accused receives a forensically fair trial, if it would

be unfair to present certain evidence or subject the accused to a particular type of trial, he should

not be tried in that manner. In appropriate circumstances, the doctrine of entrapment could be

availed of by an accused to obtain relief against oppressive actions by the Police.

Turning towards Sri Lankas law, learned Presidents Counsel submitted that in terms of Article 13(3)

of the Constitution, every accused was entitled to receive a fair trial. He submitted that it was a very

important Fundamental Right. A prosecution which is founded upon entrapment deprives an

accused of a fair trial. Therefore, principles of law pertaining to entrapment should be applied when

deciding Sri Lankan cases of the instant nature. Learned counsel submitted that if the investigation

that resulted in the indictment of the accused was based on entrapment, following trial, the accused

should not be convicted. In view of these principles of law, as the accused have been unlawfully

convicted by the Permanent High Court at Bar, in Appeal, the conviction should be quashed and the

Appeal should be allowed.

It is necessary to place on record, that though learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Appellant

initially attempted to portray that entrapment was an exculpatory defence even under Sri Lankan

law, he later abandoned that position, and sought to convince this Court (and I would think,

advisedly) that entrapment is an unlawful investigative technique, and thus, the presentation of

evidence emanating from an entrapment is unlawful. He submitted that in the instant case, the

prosecution had presented evidence emanating from such an entrapment (which amounted to

unlawfully gathered evidence), and hence the 1st Appellant (together with the 2nd Appellant) had

been denied a fair trial.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 98 of 145 Learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Appellant further submitted that it was at the instance of

CIABOC officers, that the virtual complainant had got in touch with the 2nd Appellant and

accordingly on 05.09.2017 both of them had met at the Waters Edge restaurant. On the advice of

CIABOC officers, through the 2nd Appellant, a meeting with the 1st Appellant had been arranged.

That meeting took place on 27.02.2018 at the office of the 2nd Appellant. At this meeting, learned

Counsel alleged that due to persistence by the virtual complainant the 1st Appellant solicited a bribe

of Rs. 100 million, out of which the virtual complainant was asked by the 1st Appellant to pay a sum

of Rs. 20 million, as an advance. It was submitted that the said solicitation of a bribe took place due

to trickery practiced on the 1st Appellant by officers of the CIABOC and the virtual complainant.

After this meeting, CIABOC officers attempted to get down the 1st Appellant to the residence of the

virtual complainant. Notwithstanding entreaties made by the virtual complainant, the 1st Appellant

did not fall prey to that trap. Once again on 28.04.2018, at the instance of the virtual complainant,

the 2nd Appellant persuaded the 1st Appellant to come to Bread Talk to meet the virtual

complainant. This meeting took place on the same day at Bread Talk outlet, and it is alleged that the

1st Appellant repeated the solicitation of the bribe of Rs. 20 million. Thereafter, the virtual

complainant proceeded to India and was there for a week, and returned. After he returned, the 1st

Appellant was inveigled by the virtual complainant to come to the Taj Samudra Hotel, and that final

meeting took place on 03.05.2018, where the learned Presidents Counsel submitted that a trap

had been laid. Learned counsel submitted that this sequence of events and the associated

circumstances, clearly point towards entrapment perpetrated by officers of the CIABOC together

with the virtual complainant, to which the 1st Appellant fell victim to.

In view of the foregoing facts and circumstances, learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Appellant

submitted that this was a case of entrapment, and thus, the 1st Appellant has been denied a fair

trial and hence the conviction of the 1st Appellant should be quashed in appeal.

Submissions on behalf of the 2nd Appellant

Augmenting the submissions made in this regard by learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st

Appellant and successfully creating a synergy between the two submissions, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the 2nd Appellant submitted that the Constitution ensures and guarantees unto the

Accused in this case, as well as to all other accused, the fundamental right to a fair trial. However,

the Accused Appellants in this matter were deprived of a fair trial due to several reasons; the

investigation carried out by CIABOC officers amounted to an entrapment was one, and the main

ground. The other grounds urged by learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Appellant which he

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 99 of 145 alleged resulted in the Appellants being denied a fair trial have been dealt with by my brother

judges as separate and substantive questions of law on their own standing. As I agree with the

reasons, findings and conclusions reached in respect of those other grounds of Appeal, I do not

propose to deal with those grounds raised by learned Presidents Counsel.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Appellant submitted that investigation officers of CIABOC

have not been vested with power to engage in an entrapment in the nature of what they did in this

case. He said that officers of CIABOC have induced and inveigled the virtual complainant who

complained only of an instance of solicitation of a bribe, to participate in a scheme which had been

designed to entrap the Appellants, so that they may be prosecuted. The entrapment perpetrated by

officers of the CIABOC with the cooperation and assistance provided by the virtual complainant

resulted in the Appellants committing offences, which they would not have otherwise committed.

Entrapment was caused when the virtual complainant offered a bribe to the Appellants, afresh.

Such offering was done with the view to luring the Appellants to commit the offence of accepting a

bribe, and apprehending the Appellants in the act of acceptance.

Quoting certain observations of Justice Saleem Marsoof, PC in Namunukula Plantations Limited v.

Minister of Lands and 6 Others, [(2012) 1 Sri L.R. 365], learned Presidents Counsel submitted that

the conduct of officers of CIABOC was contrary to public policy and hence a prosecution launched

based on such a scheme ought not be entertained by any Court, as it would be a pollution of the

pure stream of justice.

Citing the judgment of Justice Roberts in Sorrells v. United States, [287 US 435 (1932], learned

Presidents Counsel submitted that this Court should adopt the definition of entrapment found in

the said judgment. It defines entrapment as the conception and planning of an offence by an

officer and his procurement of its commission by one who would not have perpetrated it except for

the trickery, persuasion or fraud of the officer. Learned Presidents Counsel submitted that in the

same case, Justice Roberts has held that, Proof of entrapment at any stage of the case, requires

the court to stop the prosecution, direct that the indictment be quashed, and the defendant set at

liberty. .

Referring to the powers and functions of the CIABOC in terms of the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act, No.19 of 1994 (CIABOC Act), learned Presidents Counsel

submitted that the CIABOC and its officers did not have the power to trap a person or to find out

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 100 of 145 whether he will commit an offence. Citing Lord Goddard in Brannan v. Peek [(1947) 2 All ER 572],

he submitted that unless authorized by an Act of Parliament, no trap can be laid by the police to find

out whether a man will commit an offence, and that persons trapping him like that would be

accomplices, who are themselves liable for punishment. He submitted that the doctrine pertaining

to the prohibition on entrapment contained in Brannan v. Peek should be adopted by Sri Lankan

Courts under section 100 of the Evidence Ordinance and incorporated into Sri Lankas Law of

Evidence.

The position advanced by learned Presidents Counsel was that upon recording the complaint of the

virtual complainant Nagarajah relating to the alleged solicitation of a bribe by the 1st Appellant,

CIABOC officials should have proceeded to investigate that complaint. If the complaint revealed the

commission of an offence or offences, the Commission should have directly taken action against

those who have committed such offence(s). He submitted that without doing that, the investigators

had engaged in a process of entrapment which is unlawful. Officers of the CIABOC did so by

directing Nagarajah to re-establish contact with the Appellants, record all communications he had

with them, and luring the suspects to commit further offences. He submitted that doing so was in

excess of the powers conferred on CIABOC by the CIABOC Act and was thus, illegal. Therefore,

learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the trial Court (Permanent High Court at Bar) should

have rejected the testimony presented by the prosecution relating to the series of events which are

said to have occurred after Nagarajahs complaint was recorded by officers of the CIABOC.

Learned Presidents Counsel in his post-argument written submissions brought to the attention of

this Court the following quotation from the judgment of Justice Panchapakesa Ayyar in M.S.

Mohiddin v. Unknown [AIR 1952 Mad 561]:

I have held in several cases already that there are two kinds of traps a legitimate trap,

where the offence has already been born and is in its course, and an illegitimate trap,

where the offence has not yet been born and a temptation is offered to see whether an

offence would be committed, succumbing to it, or not. Thus, where the bribe has already

been demanded from a man, and the man goes out offering to bring the money but goes to

the police and the magistrate and brings them to witness the payment, it will be a legitimate

trap, wholly laudable and admirable, and adopted in every civilized country without the least

criticism by any honest man. But, where a man has not demanded a bribe, and he is only

suspected to be in the habit of taking bribes, and he is tempted with a bribe just to see

whether he would accept it or not and to trap him if he accepts it, will be an illegitimate trap

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 101 of 145

and, unless authorized by an Act of Parliament, it will be an offence on the part of the

persons taking part in the trap who will all be accomplices whose evidence will have to be

corroborated by untainted evidence to a smaller or larger extent as the case may be before a

conviction can be had under a rule of Court which has ripened almost into a rule of law. But,

in the case of a legitimate trap, the officers taking part in the trap, like P.Ws 9 to 11, and the

witnesses to the trap, like P.W. 8 would in no sense be accomplices and their evidence will

not require under the law, to be corroborated as a condition precedent for conviction though

the usual rule of prudence will require the evidence to be scrutinized carefully and accepted

as true before a conviction can be had.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Appellant also drew the attention of this Court to the

following quote from the judgment in Ramjanam Singh v. The State of Bihar [AIR 1956 SC 643]:

Whatever the criminal tendencies of a man may be, he has a right to expect that he will not

be deliberately tempted beyond the powers of his frail endurance and provoked into breaking

the law; and more particularly by those who are the guardians and keepers of the law.

However regrettable the necessity of employing agents provocateurs may be (and we realize

to the full that this is unfortunately often inevitable if corruption is to be detected and bribery

stamped out), it is one thing to tempt a suspected offender to overt action when he is doing

all he can to commit a crime and has every intention of carrying through his nefarious

purpose from start to finish, and quite another to egg him on to do that which it has been

finally and firmly decided shall not be done.

Summing up his submissions on this point, learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Appellant

submitted that there cannot be a valid conviction in the absence of a legal and fair investigation. He

alleged that the evidence in this case in its entirety is the result of an entrapment which was illegal

and conducted by officers of the CIABOC. Learned counsel alleged that the evidence in this case had

not been procured by the investigators during a legally valid and fair investigation. Quoting from the

judgment of Justice Mark Fernando in Victor Ivon v. Sarath N. Silva, Attorney General and Another

[(1998) 1 Sri L.R. 340], learned Presidents Counsel concluded his submission by stating that a

citizen is entitled to a proper investigation one which is fair, competent, timely and appropriate .

Submissions on behalf of the Respondent

Responding to the submissions made by learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellants, learned

Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent (CIABOC) made two key submissions. They were that (i)

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 102 of 145 entrapment is not a substantive defence in Sri Lankan jurisprudence, and (ii) assuming without

conceding that the defence of entrapment can be taken by an accused in a criminal case in Sri Lanka

either as an exculpatory defence or as a ground on which it could be alleged that the accused had

been denied a fair trial, the facts of the instant case do not fall within the scope of entrapment as

recognized by other jurisdictions, and thus the question of legality of the evidence presented by the

prosecution does not arise. He emphasized that the two Appellants had not been denied a fair trial.

For the purpose of determining whether a particular set of facts pertaining to an investigation reveal

the existence of an entrapment or not, learned Deputy Solicitor General presented the following

quotation from the House of Lords judgment in R v. Loosely, [(2001) UKHL 53]:

On this a useful guide is to consider whether the police did no more than present the

defendant with an unexceptional opportunity to commit a crime. I emphasize the word

unexceptional. The yardstick for the purpose of this test is, in general, whether the police

conduct preceding the commission of the offence was no more than might have been

expected from others in the circumstances. Police conduct of this nature is not to be regarded

as inciting or instigating crime, or luring a person into committing a crime. The police did no

more than others could be expected to do. The police did not create crime artificially.

McHugh J had this approach in mind in Ridgeway v. The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19, 92, when

he said:

The State can justify the use of entrapment techniques to induce the commission of

an offence only when the inducement is consistent with the ordinary temptations and

stratagems that are likely to be encountered in the course of criminal activity. That

may mean that some degree of deception, importunity and even threats on the part

of authorities may be acceptable. But once the State goes beyond the ordinary, it is

likely to increase the incidence of crime by artificial means.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that though the defence of entrapment was

recognized in certain overseas jurisdictions, English Courts do not treat entrapment as a substantive

defence. Citing R v. Sang, [(1980) AC 402], he submitted that the Court had held that the physical

and mental elements of an offence are both constituted even when there is entrapment, and that in

the circumstances, the value if any of the defence of entrapment is limited to mitigation of

culpability. In support of his submission as regards the position in English law, learned DSG cited the

following excerpt from the judgment of Lord Nicholls in R. v. Loosely, [(2001) UKHL 53]:

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 103 of 145

In R v Sang [1980] AC 402 Your Lordships' House affirmed the Court of Appeal decisions of R

v McEvilly (1973) 60 Cr App R 150 and R v Mealey (1974) 60 Cr App R 59. The House treated it

as axiomatic that entrapment does not exist as a substantive defence in English law. Lord

Diplock, at p 432, noted that many crimes are committed by one person at the instigation of

others. The fact that the counsellor or procurer is a policeman or a police informer, although

it may be of relevance in mitigation of penalty for the offence, cannot affect the guilt of the

principal offender: 'both the physical element (actus reus) and the mental element (mens rea)

of the offence with which he is charged are present in his case'. Likewise, Lord Fraser of

Tullybelton observed, at p 446, that all the elements, factual and mental, of guilt are present

and no finding other than guilty would be logically possible. The degree of guilt may be

modified by the inducement and that can appropriately be reflected in the sentence. Lord

Fraser famously added that when Eve, taxed with having eaten forbidden fruit, replied 'the

serpent beguiled me', her excuse was at most a plea in mitigation and not a complete

defence.

In view of the foregoing, learned DSG urged this Court to follow English law regarding this matter,

and to not recognize entrapment as a substantive defence. He stressed that, if at all, entrapment

should be treated only as a mitigatory ground for reduction of the severity of the punishment.

Referring to R v. Loosely learned DSG conceded that, following the enactment of the Police and

Criminal Evidence Act (1984) by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (the enactment of which pre-

dates the decision in R v. Loosely), the concept of excluding from criminal trials evidence emanating

from entrapment has been recognized by English law, if such entrapment amounted to an abuse of

power or if the conduct of the Police was illegal. He submitted that trial judges were permitted to

exclude such evidence on the premise that permitting such evidence would affect fairness of the

proceedings. He submitted that in the circumstances, exclusion of evidence emanating from

entrapment in English law is an evidential principle as opposed to an exculpatory defence.

Learned DSG submitted further that in Sri Lankan law, trial judges were not empowered to exclude

evidence that is relevant and admissible (in terms of the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance), on

the premise that such evidence would affect fairness. Citing Rajapakse v. Fernando [52 NLR 361], he

submitted that even evidence emanating from a search which was in the circumstances of the

situation illegal was admissible provided such evidence was relevant. In this regard, learned DSG

cited the following excerpt from the judgment of Justice Dias:

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 104 of 145

I agree that it would be immoral and undesirable that agents provocateur and others should

tempt or abet persons to commit offences; but it is a question whether it is open to a Court to

acquit such persons where the offence is proved, on the sole ground that the evidence was

procured by unfair means. Such considerations may induce the trial Judge to disbelieve the

evidence, but such evidence is not inadmissible, and, therefore, when the offence charged has

been proved, it is the duty of the Judge to convict.

It is a point of considerable significance that learned DSG while emphasizing that admission of

evidence during a trial should be screened only from the perspective of relevancy and

admissibility (as per provisions of the Evidence Ordinance), did not venture to comment on

whether the views of Justice Dias should be reconsidered in the present era, in view of the possible

causal relationship between evidence gathered through unlawful means and depriving an accused

of the fundamental right to a fair trial.

Based on an analysis of the judgment of the House of Lords in R v. Loosely, learned Deputy Solicitor

General pointed out that when determining whether a particular modus operandi adopted by law

enforcement authorities in the conduct of an investigation amounts to entrapment (which method

he admitted should not be condoned), there are several features the Courts should consider. They

are (a) the nature of the offence that was being investigated into, (b) reason for the investigators

having adopted the particular investigative procedure, (c) the nature and extent of participation by

the investigators, (d) intrusiveness of the investigative method adopted, (e) whether the

investigators acted in good-faith, and (f) the antecedents of the suspect.

Turning towards the evidence, learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the following

evidential aspects pertaining to the case, should be taken into consideration:

(i) The involvement of officers of the CIABOC commenced only after the 1st Appellant had in

August 2016 made the initial solicitation of a bribe of USD 3 million from the virtual

complainant.

(ii) Following the first instance when the solicitation was made, the 1st Appellant had on

several other occasions solicited from the virtual complainant a bribe, and such events

reveal a predisposition on the part of the 1st Appellant to accept a bribe from the virtual

complainant.

(iii) On 5th September 2017 (well before the virtual complainant complained to the CIABOC),

when the virtual complainant met the 2nd Appellant at the Waters Edge, the 2nd

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 105 of 145

Appellant had on his own motion solicited a bribe on behalf of the 1st Appellant. That was

without the virtual complainant having induced the 2nd Appellant.

(iv) From that point onwards, it was the 2nd Appellant who had arranged meetings between

the 1st Appellant and the virtual complainant. The virtual complainant did not initiate any

of those meetings.

(v) At no stage did the officers of the CIABOC instigate or induce or lure either of the

Appellants to solicit or accept a bribe. Nor did the virtual complainant do so.

(vi) The role of the decoy who was an officer of the CIABOC was passive, non-intrusive and

was a mere pedestrian like presence.

(vii) The decoy did not actively guide the virtual complainant, or manipulate the processes of

the raid.

(viii) The virtual complainant on the strict advice of officers of the CIABOC refrained from

enticing, luring or otherwise encouraging the 1st and the 2nd Appellants to commit any

offence.

Learned DSG submitted that these items of evidence and circumstances support his contention that

the instant case was not a case of entrapment. Learned DSG using terminology found in R v.

Loosely stressed that the role of CIABOC officers was limited to providing an unexceptional

opportunity to commit a long-standing pre-planned crime which was already in the move. He

submitted that in the circumstances, the evidence emanating from the prosecutions narrative from

the time the virtual complainant complained to the CIABOC up to the arrest of the Appellants,

should not be rejected and should be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining this

Appeal. He concluded his submissions by stating that in view of the foregoing, the Appellants had

not been denied a fair trial.

Finding of the Trial Court

An examination of the impugned judgment of the Permanent High Court at Bar reveals that learned

Counsel who defended the two Appellants at the trial had raised the defence of entrapment on the

footing that the virtual complainant Nagarajah had acted as an agent provocateur, and that he had

lured the accused to commit the offences in the indictment. In the circumstances, learned Counsel

had pleaded that the evidence of the virtual complainant relating to events that are said to have

occurred from the moment the complaint was made to the CIABOC, be excluded from the trial.

Following a consideration of R. v. Sang, the trial Court had rejected the submission that English law

recognizes the defence of entrapment. Drawing a parallel, the view formed by the trial Court is

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 106 of 145 that Sri Lankas law too does not recognize the defence of entrapment. Thus, the Court has

concluded that the evidence presented by the prosecution against the accused cannot be rejected.

Such refusal to reject evidence presented by the prosecution has also been on the footing that

virtual complainants conduct cannot be treated as that of an agent provocateur.

Consideration, conclusions and findings

The fundamental right to a fair trial

The right of a person accused of committing an offence, to a fair trial against him, which is a

fundamental right recognized by Article 13(3) of the Constitution, is of unparalleled importance. It is

an important and crucial safeguard to ensure that only a person guilty of having committed an

offence is convicted by a Court. Such conviction should be conditioned upon the prosecution

having proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. It is a fair trial that

ultimately ensures that not a single innocent person is convicted of committing an offence for which

he is not culpable of. Rightfully, the concept of a fair trial finds itself a foremost place even in the

main objective of criminal justice, that in my opinion being, the prevention, detection and

investigation of crime, and the prosecution and punishment of offenders founded upon a lawful and

fair trial.

Particularly due to the prospect of a criminal trial resulting in the imposition of serious penal

sanctions which have the potential of depriving the convict of his personal liberty, as well as

affecting his financial and proprietary interests culminating in serious and far-reaching

consequences, the conduct of criminal trials and related prosecutions must not only be procedurally

lawful, they must be conducted in a fair manner as well.

It is primarily a fair trial that reflects the civility of any criminal justice system and ensures that the

dignity of all persons who may be prosecuted by the state is protected and that criminal justice is

administered according to law, equitably, and in a fair manner. It is the rule of law and a fair trial

that separates a prosecution from a persecution. Persecution is a major afront to the rule of law

and is unfair. Persecution is a sign of incivility. In the long-term, systematic and widespread

persecution has the distinct potential of causing social unrest, resulting in the breakdown of an

otherwise cohesive and law-abiding society and culminating in the destruction of the state. The

insistence upon the conduct of criminal trials in a fair manner is a safeguard against such dangerous

evils.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 107 of 145

It is a fair trial that distinguishes a competent criminal trial court discharging justice according to

law which is very much in national and public interest, from what is colloquially referred to as a

kangaroo court of which the hallmarks are (i) illegitimacy, (ii) absence of independence,

impartiality and neutrality, (iii) lack or absence of professionalism and fairness on the part of the

judge and the prosecutor, and (iv) the existence of subjectivity, arbitrariness, unreasonableness,

prejudice and unjustifiable haste.

Fair trial is consonant with the administration of justice, and serves as a protection against

harassment and oppressive intrusion into the liberty of not only innocent persons, but even persons

who may be culpable of committing offences.

Therefore, fair trial is necessarily a core feature to be expected from Sri Lankas criminal justice

system, which should permeate throughout the multiple phases of the criminal justice system,

without being technically restricted to the trial stage. It is an imperative legal requirement that

should prevail during pre-trial, trial and post-trail stages of criminal justice. It is of such importance

that an accused deprived of a fair trial thereby gains the entitlement to have his conviction

challenged in Appeal on that ground alone, particularly if grave and irreparable prejudice to the

accused had resulted from such absence or lack of a fair trial culminating in a miscarriage of

justice.

Article 13(3) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka provides as follows:

Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard, in person or by an attorney-

at-law, at a fair trial by a competent court. [Emphasis added]

The importance the Constitution has placed on the fundamental right to a fair trial is manifest in the

fact that Article 15 of the Constitution does not recognize any restrictions that may be lawfully

imposed on the enjoyment of the right to a fair trial, save as to certain very limited restrictions that

may be prescribed by law. The only restriction permitted by the Constitution are those that may be

prescribed by law and made applicable only to trials against members of the armed forces, the

police and other forces who may be charged with the maintenance of public order. Thus, there can

be no derogation from the right to a fair trial even with regard to persons who may be indicted of

having committed the most heinous type of offences such as those that may cause serious harm to

national security or to the society as a whole.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 108 of 145 In The Attorney-General v. Segulebbe Latheef and Another, [(2008) 1 Sri L.R. 225] and Attorney-

General v. Aponso, [(2008) B.L.R. 145], Justice J.A.N. De Silva (as His Lordship was then) has

highlighted the importance of recognizing the right to a fair trial in the following words:

The Constitution by Article 13(3) expressly guarantees the right of a person charged with an

offence to be heard by person or by an Attorney-at-law at a "fair trial" by a competent court.

This right is recognised obviously for the reason that a criminal trial (subject to an appeal) is

the final stage of a proceeding at the end of which a person may have to suffer penalties of

one sort or another, if found guilty. The right of an accused persons to a fair trial is

recognized in all the criminal justice systems in the civilized world. Its denial is generally proof

enough that justice has been denied.

Justice J.A.N. De Silva has observed that the right of an accused person to a fair trial is recognized in

all criminal justice systems in the civilized world. Its denial is generally proof enough that justice has

been denied. Justice De Silva has further observed that like the concept of fairness, a fair trial is also

not capable of a clear definition. However, there are certain aspects or qualities of a fair trial

amongst other things which could be identified.

From a holistic perspective, it is in public interest that the following are ensured:

(i) That a person who has committed an offence and is therefore indicted, must be found

guilty and convicted of committing the offence he has been charged with, and is

appropriately punished in terms of the law. However, such outcome must be achieved by

prosecuting the alleged offender before a competent court, through a procedurally

lawful and fair trial at which evidence that is legally relevant is presented in terms of

legally admissible means, through credible witnesses, whose testimonies are

trustworthy.

(ii) That a person who has not committed an offence, who nevertheless may have been

indicted, must be found not guilty and acquitted of the charges in terms of the law,

following a procedurally lawful and fair trial.

Trial outcomes that are contrary to these two principles are inconsistent with the objectives of

criminal justice and are not in public interest.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 109 of 145 As pointed out by learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Appellant, a trial should not only be

forensically fair (which means compatibility with procedural and evidential rules), it must be fair in

the true sense of the word.

In Zahira Habibullah Sheik and Another v. State of Gujarat and Others, [Criminal Appeal No. 446-

449 of 2004, decided in March 2006 by the Supreme Court of India], Justice Arijith Pasayat has held

the following:

The principle of fair trial now informs and energizes many areas of the law. It is reflected in

numerous rules and practices. It is a constant, ongoing development process continually

adapted to new and changing circumstances, and exigencies of the situation peculiar at

times and related to the nature of crime, persons involved directly or operating behind,

social impart and societal needs and even so many powerful balancing factors which may

come in the way of administration of the criminal justice system. Denial of a fair trial is as

much injustice to the accused as it is to the victim and the society. Fair trial obviously would

mean a trial before an impartial judge, a fair prosecutor and an atmosphere of judicial calm.

In view of the foregoing, it is my view that judges of trial Courts of this country have an enormous

and extraordinary legal responsibility of ensuring that criminal trials are conducted not only in a

forensically accurate manner (in accordance with procedure prescribed by law and in compliance

with the rules of evidence) but also in a fair manner as well. Similarly, there is an associated

professional duty cast on the prosecutor (who in the conduct of criminal prosecutions has a quasi-

judicial responsibility to perform, solely in public interest) to conduct the prosecution not only as

provided for in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and to present evidence in accordance with the

law of Evidence, but also to discharge that pivotal professional responsibility towards the

administration of justice in a fair manner as well. I cannot see a fair trial taking place, unless both

the trial judge and the prosecutor discharge their responsibilities in a fair manner. That of course

does not mean that all judicial orders and prosecutorial decisions should be favourable to the

accused. What it means is that, while the trial judge should make lawful, judicious and fair decisions,

the prosecutor must act in a quasi-judicial and fair manner, necessarily in public interest. The master

and the guiding force of both the judge and the prosecutor should be the law and the law alone, and

no individual or organization or self-interest.

There is one more point that requires, what I wish to refer to as a passing comment . It is necessary

to note that the concept of fairness at a criminal trial has been so far recognized as a fundamental

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 110 of 145 right only from the perspective of the accused. However, in my view, it is of paramount importance

to recognize that victims of crime are also entitled to receive a fair trial. The right to a fair trial is one

of the underlying legal concepts based upon which the Parliament has enacted numerous rights of

victims of crime and made them justiciable in terms of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of

Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015. Thus, victims of crime are also entitled by law to receive a

fair trial. Witnesses too, have an entitlement to testify at a fair trial. What is even more important to

note is that when an offence has been committed, the public at large and the state also have the

entitlement to have a lawful, fair and expeditious trial against the perpetrator of the offence. Such

trial should be aimed at the conviction of the guilty or the acquittal of the innocent.

Relationship between the fundamental right to a fair trial and adjudication of a criminal appeal

It is natural for one to wonder why in the judicial adjudication of a criminal appeal, judicial

consideration need be given to the examination and determination of whether in the impugned trial

proceedings the accused appellant had been deprived of the fundamental right to a fair trial. In

this regard, it is pertinent to observe that in terms of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka, it is the duty of all organs of the state (the Executive, Legislature and the

Judiciary) to respect, protect and promote the fundamental rights of all persons and not to act in a

manner that would infringe fundamental rights. In fact, in my view, the spirit of Sri Lankas

Constitution demands that the three organs of the state undertake and carryout an activist role

towards the promotion and protection of fundamental rights. That is an overarching Constitutional

duty cast on the state towards the public at large.

While Articles 17 read with 126 provide for a specific mechanism to impugn executive or

administrative action on the footing that such action infringed one or more fundamental rights or

that there exists an imminent likelihood of a fundamental right being infringed and to therefor

obtain declarations from the Supreme Court to that effect and just and equitable relief, it remains

the responsibility of all Courts to ensure that judicial proceedings (notwithstanding the nature of the

jurisdiction invoked) are conducted in a manner in which fundamental rights are not infringed. It is

important to note that as the mechanism contained in Articles 17 and 126 does not confer

jurisdiction on the Supreme Court to adjudicate upon allegations that a particular judicial conduct or

a judicial decision resulted in an infringement of a fundamental right, it is through appellate

proceedings of this nature that the Supreme Court could examine such allegations. Thus, in

appellate proceedings (such as in the instant appeal), when an allegation is made that the impugned

criminal trial proceedings were conducted in a manner that infringed the fundamental rights of the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 111 of 145 accused, the Supreme Court must give its anxious consideration to such allegation and arrive at a

finding thereon. If it is found that a fundamental right the accused appellant was entitled to enjoy

had been infringed during trial proceedings and such infringement had resulted in a miscarriage of

justice, the conviction of the accused appellant must be set aside.

In this regard it would be pertinent to note that Justice Buwaneka Aluwihare in Hattuwan Pedige

Sugath Karunarathne v. Attorney-General [SC Appeal 32/2020, Supreme Court Minutes of 20th

October 2020] has observed that Courts must respect and give effect to Constitutional provisions in

the conduct of Court proceedings, such as the fundamental rights contained in Chapter III of the

Constitution. Justice Aluwihare has proceeded to observe that Article 13(3) recognizes the

entitlement of a person charged with an offence to a fair trial, a right which the state has an

obligation to accord to an accused through the Courts. It is important to note that these

observations were made by Justice Aluwihare in the course of adjudicating upon a criminal Appeal.

Basis for the allegation that the Appellants had been denied a fair trial

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellants presented their arguments on the footing that the

entire investigation conducted by the CIABOC was founded upon a process of investigation which

they referred to as entrapment. They submitted that the investigative process of entrapment is

illegal (or to say the least unlawful), and that such illegality in the investigation resulted in the

Appellants being deprived of a fair trial, since a lawful and fair investigation was a prerequisite for a

fair trial. They submitted that the Appellants had been denied a fair trial, as the Prosecutions

evidence was founded upon an entrapment which was illegal. Thus, from a generic perspective, the

position advanced on behalf of the Appellants was that as the prosecution was founded upon an

entrapment, the accused were deprived of a fair trial, and hence the convictions must be quashed.

Therefore, it is necessary to first consider and conclude whether a lawful investigation is a

prerequisite for a fair trial or whether a lawful investigation is a component of a fair trial.

Nature and ingredients of the right to a fair trial

Though the Constitution recognizes the right to a fair trial as a Fundamental Right, the black letters

of the Constitution remain conspicuous by their silence as to the exact meaning and the constituent

ingredients of a fair trial.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 112 of 145 The conceptual origins of a fair hearing (used synonymously with the term fair trial) being afforded

to a person accused of committing a crime are found in the Magna Carta of 1215 AD. *" No

freeman shall be taken, imprisoned, disseised, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will

we proceed against or prosecute him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the

land To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay, right or justice."]

The specific rules which regulate a fair trial have evolved from the rules of natural justice. It is widely

accepted that the concept of a fair hearing was developed by the judges of Courts of Equity in

England and thereby entered the English common law. In contemporary English law, the concept of

a fair hearing has found its way into both administrative law and the law relating to criminal justice.

A fair hearing as a Human Right was initially recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human

Rights (UDHR) in 1948. Article 10 of the Declaration provides that, Everyone is entitled in full

equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination

of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him. [Emphasis added] Articles 11,

14 and 15 of the Declaration refer to certain ensuing rights of persons accused of committing

offences, which seek to guarantee a fair trial.

The significance of Articles 10, 11, 14 and 15 of the UDHR fell outside the spotlight in 1966 by the

right to a fair trial being recognized as a Human Right under the International Covenant on Civil and

Political Rights (ICCPR). With almost universal ratification of the Covenant, the ICCPR serves as the

bedrock for contemporary International Human Rights Law.

Article 14 of the ICCPR reads as follows:

1. All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any

criminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall

be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal

established by law. The press and the public may be excluded from all or part of a trial for

reasons of morals, public order (ordre public) or national security in a democratic society, or

when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires, or to the extent strictly

necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice

the interests of justice; but any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a suit at law shall

be made public except where the interest of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the

proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or the guardianship of children.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 113 of 145

2. Everyone charged with a criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent

until proved guilty according to law.

3. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the

following minimum guarantees, in full equality:

(a) To be informed promptly and in detail in a language which he understands of the

nature and cause of the charge against him;

(b) To have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and to

communicate with counsel of his own choosing;

(c) To be tried without undue delay;

(d) To be tried in his presence, and to defend himself in person or through legal

assistance of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of

this right; and to have legal assistance assigned to him, in any case where the

interests of justice so require, and without payment by him in any such case if he does

not have sufficient means to pay for it;

(e) To examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him and to obtain the

attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as

witnesses against him;

(f) To have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the

language used in court;

(g) Not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.

4. In the case of juvenile persons, the procedure shall be such as will take account of their age

and the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation.

5. Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being

reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law.

6. When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when

subsequently his conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned on the ground that a

new or newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice,

the person who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall be compensated

according to law, unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the unknown fact in time is

wholly or partly attributable to him.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 114 of 145

7. No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already

been finally convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each

country.

Supplementing the ICCPR, several regional Human Rights treaties have come into being, among

which is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) of 1950. Article 6 of the ECHR seeks to

guarantee the human right to a fair trial. Article 6(1) provides as follows:

In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against

him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an

independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced

publicly but the press and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests

of morals, public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of

juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent strictly

necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice

the interests of justice. [Emphasis added]

Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights which contain very important pronouncements

on the right to a fair trial embodied in the ECHR (such as Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal cited by the

House of Lords in R. v. Looseley, the case which was referred to frequently by learned Counsel

during the hearing of this Appeal) have contributed immensely to the development of jurisprudence

regarding the human right to a fair trial.

It is to be noted that Article 14 of the ICCPR while recognizing the right to a fair hearing as a Human

Right, contains both substantive and procedural safeguards to ensure that accused receive a fair

trial. They are recognized under international human rights law only as minimum legal guarantees to

be accorded to a person accused of committing an offence. A careful consideration of the schemes

and provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (CCPA) and the Evidence Ordinance (EO) reveal

that these two laws which are the two primary cornerstones of the criminal justice system of Sri

Lanka, have been designed and structured to recognize many of the features contained in Article 14

of the ICCPR and generally the concept of a fair trial. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the

CCPA and the EO do not contain ingredients of a fair trial, exhaustively. Those two laws, provide only

the minimum features of a fair trial.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 115 of 145 In 2007, the Parliament enacted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act,

No. 56 of 2007, as its preamble reads, to give effect to certain Articles of the ICCPR relating to

Human Rights which have not been given domestic recognition through legislative measures.

Section 4 of the Act confers on alleged offenders the following entitlements:

(1) A person charged of a criminal offence under any written law, shall be entitled

(a) to be afforded an opportunity of being tried in his presence;

(b) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing and where

he does not have any such assistance, to be informed of that right;

(c) to have legal assistance assigned to him in appropriate cases where the interest of

justice so requires and without any payment by him, where he does not have sufficient

means to pay for such assistance:

(d) to examine or to have examined the witnesses against him and to obtain the

attendance of witnesses on his behalf, under the same conditions as witnesses called

against him;

(e) to have the assistance of an interpreter where such person cannot understand or

speak the language in which the trial is being conducted; and

(f) not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt.

(2) Every person convicted of a criminal offence under any written law, shall have the right to

appeal to a higher court against such conviction and any sentence imposed.

(3) No person shall be tried or punished for any criminal offence for which such person has

already been convicted or acquitted according to law.

Whether these entitlements have the force of law and unconditional justiciability (particularly as

they have not been, surprisingly though, classified as rights) is a matter to be decided in an

appropriate case. However, it is pertinent to note that substantial judicial recognition of these

entitlements is found in Attorney-General v. Aponso (cited above).

It is noteworthy that both Article 14 of the ICCPR and section 4 of the ICCPR Act make no mention

regarding the need for a lawful investigation based upon which a criminal prosecution could be

founded upon and for a lawful investigation to be a condition precedent for a fair trial.

Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider whether this lacuna in international treaty and domestic

statutory law, needs to be filled by judicial pronouncements resulting in the development of the

common law.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 116 of 145

In Wijepala v. Attorney General [(2001) 1 Sri L.R. 46] Mark Fernando, J. observed that Article 13(3)

not only entitles an accused to a right to legal representation at a trial before a competent court,

but also to a fair trial, and that includes anything and everything necessary for a fair trial.

(Emphasis added.) Thus, it is seen that Justice Mark Fernando has by the use of the term anything

and everything indicated the impossibility of defining the concept of a fair trial and exhaustively

describing the constituent ingredients of a fair trial. He has observed the expansive nature of the

concept of a fair trial. Indeed, what amounts to a fair trial would be extremely difficult to define. It is

only a series of judgments on this matter that would give rise to a comprehensive description of the

concept of a fair trial and illustrate a definitive list of the constituent ingredients of the concept.

Whether or not an accused has been denied a fair trial must be determined upon a consideration of

the attendant facts and circumstances of the case in comparison with the requirements of a fair

trial.

Link between the right to a fair trial, a lawful investigation and the institution of criminal

proceedings

It is noteworthy that both the institution of criminal proceedings and the conduct of criminal

prosecutions are founded upon the conduct of criminal and forensic investigations. A criminal

investigation can be described as a legally regulated process, which is required to be conducted by

officials who possess the legal authority to conduct such a process. The primary objectives for which

a criminal investigation is conducted, are as follows:

(a) To ascertain the truth pertaining to the information, complaint or allegation that an offence

has been committed (i.e. whether in fact an offence has been committed).

(b) If the investigation reveals that in fact an offence has been committed, ascertaining the

identity of the perpetrator.

(c) Apprehending the perpetrator.

(d) Collecting investigative material that would have the potential of being admissible against

such perpetrator in a court of law, by converting such material into judicial evidence (oral,

documentary and technical), so that criminal proceedings could be instituted against the

perpetrator, and upon successful prosecution of the perpetrator, he could be convicted for

committing the offence and be appropriately punished.

It must be noted that the function of the Attorney General with regard to the institution of criminal

proceedings (following a consideration of investigative material) has been conferred on him by

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 117 of 145 statute (the written law). A decision on the institution of criminal proceedings has a direct bearing

on the legal rights and interests of both the suspect / accused (alleged offender) and the relevant

victim of crime. Therefore, this function of the Attorney General should be viewed from the

perspectives of principles of public law. Subject to the exception provided by section 24 of the

Commissions of Inquiry Act (as amended by Act No. 16 of 2008), the statutory function of instituting

criminal proceedings against alleged offenders is regulated by section 393 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act (CCPA). With regard to offences that are required to be investigated into by the

police, the CCPA requires the decision of the Attorney General on the institution of criminal

proceedings to be founded upon an investigation conducted by the police in terms of the law. Thus,

with regard to an offence investigated into by the police, a decision on the institution of criminal

proceedings by the Attorney General must be founded upon an intra-vires, independent, impartial,

neutral, good faith and objective consideration of investigative material relating to an investigation

conducted by the police in a lawful manner. The same principle applies to the function of the

CIABOC pertaining to the institution of criminal proceedings by it. It needs hardly be mentioned that

the institution of criminal proceedings by either the Attorney-General or the CIABOC for whatever

collateral purposes of itself or any other person, would be unlawful and amount to an infringement

of Article 12 of the Constitution.

If investigators are permitted to conduct investigations in a manner contrary to law, it would

amount to a serious afront to the rule of law and will affect the legality of the institution of criminal

proceedings. Similarly, it will affect the integrity of the criminal justice system and frustrate the

achievement of objectives of criminal justice. It can result in persons suspected of committing

offences being deprived of their fundamental rights, the truth being suppressed, and accused

persons being unfairly prosecuted. It can give rise to innocent persons being investigated into and

actual perpetrators of crime being shielded from criminal justice. In addition to the underlying

rationale behind outlawing unlawful investigations, from a public law perspective, using

investigative material gathered through such an unlawfully conducted investigation to found a

decision on the institution of criminal proceedings would be manifestly unlawful.

In R.P. Wijesiri v. The Attorney General [(1980) 2 Sri L.R. 317], Justice Parinda Ranasinghe (as His

Lordship was then) as a Judge of the Court of Appeal, considered the vexed question of (in the

circumstances of the case examined by that Court), the legality of an indictment preferred by the

Attorney General to the High Court. His Lordship considered whether, even if the Attorney General

had the statutory power to prefer an indictment to the High Court, such indictment should have

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 118 of 145 been preceded by a lawful investigation. While answering this question in the affirmative, Justice

Ranasinghe observed the necessity for and the importance of a legally valid investigation being

conducted by the Police into an offence, before criminal proceedings are instituted by the Attorney

General. He observed that the importance of commencing proceedings before a Court in a lawful

manner cannot be overstated (at page 339). In the circumstances of that case where the Attorney

General had directly instituted criminal proceedings against the Petitioner for having committed an

offence under section 480 of the Penal Code, Justice Ranasinghe observed (at pages 346-7) that the

indictment should have been preceded by a lawful investigation, and that the absence of such a

lawful investigation preceding the indictment rendered the indictment also unlawful. Justice Abdul

Cader pronouncing a separate judgment, while expressing agreement with the views expressed by

Justice Ranasinghe, held that in the circumstances of that case, the High Court was not empowered

to try the case, as the Police had not conducted an investigation in a lawful manner in accordance

with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. He therefore ruled that the indictment

itself was unlawful.

Thus, the law is clear. The institution of criminal proceedings in the High Court by the Attorney-

General and by the Director General of the CIAOBC (who is also conferred with the statutory power

of instituting criminal proceedings before the High Court by forwarding indictment, on a direction to

do so by the Commission) should be founded upon a consideration of investigative material

collected in the course of a lawful investigation (which means an investigation conducted in terms

of the applicable law) and should be preceded by the conduct of such a lawful investigation by

competent law enforcement personnel. All criminal investigations must necessarily be conducted in

terms of the law. As observed by the Court of Appeal in R. P. Wijesiri v. The Attorney General, it is

only investigative material emanating from a lawfully conducted investigation that a prosecutorial

authority such as the Attorney General should consider for the purpose of deciding on the

institution of criminal proceedings. The same principle of law would apply to the CIABOC.

In terms of section 11 of the CIABOC Act, where the material received by the Commission in the

course of an investigation conducted under the Act, discloses the commission of an offence by any

person under the Bribery Act or the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, the Commission shall

direct the Director General to institute criminal proceedings in the appropriate Court. It is implicit in

section 11, that such investigation should be lawful. Thus, this principle applies equally to both the

Attorney-General and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption. It logically

flows from this principle of law, that, if upon a consideration of investigative material, an affirmative

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 119 of 145 decision is taken by either of these two prosecutorial authorities to institute criminal proceedings

against an alleged offender, the corresponding prosecution can be conducted only based on

material collected in the course of a lawful investigation, and not otherwise.

It is necessary to observe that basing prosecutorial decisions such as a decision on the institution of

criminal proceedings and framing of charges, and the conduct of prosecutions relying upon material

gathered in the course of an unlawful investigation, would be a violation of the doctrine of the rule

of law, and be both unreliable and unfair. The resultant effect of an unlawful investigation may be

grave prejudice being caused to the accused and depriving him of this fundamental right to a fair

trial. Such a process would also amount to an infringement of Article 12(1) of the Constitution

(which may be identified as the Constitutional guardian of the rule of law).

Fair investigations

Not only should a criminal investigation be lawful, it must be fair as well; fair from the perspective of

both the victim of crime and the suspected perpetrator of the offence. From the perspective of the

suspect, a fair investigation will include the investigator adhering to the following:

(i) Explaining to the suspect the allegation against him.

(ii) Affording the suspect, a full opportunity of presenting his position with regard to the

allegation against him and regarding persons who have made incriminatory statements and

items of incriminatory material gathered by investigators.

(iii) Conducting investigations based on exculpatory positions (if any) taken up by the suspect.

(iv) Treating the suspect in a humane manner, and in a manner that would not infringe his

fundamental rights.

The investigator must always maintain an objective mind and not view or treat the suspect with any

prejudice. Ascertainment of the truth in terms of the law should be the prime motive of the

investigator, and not to develop a case against the suspect so that he could be somehow

prosecuted.

In Nirmal Singh Kahlon v. State of Punjab and Others, [(2009) AIR SC 984] the Supreme Court of

India has held that an accused is entitled to a fair investigation. Fair investigation and fair trial

are concomitant to the preservation of fundamental right of an accused under Article 21 of the

Constitution of India. [Emphasis added] In Sidhartha Vashisht alias Manu Sharma v State (NCT of

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 120 of 145 Delhi), [(2010) 6 SCC 1] the Supreme Court of India has observed that, the alleged accused is

entitled to fairness and true investigation and fair trial, and the prosecution is expected to play a

balanced role in the trial of a crime... The investigation should be judicious, fair, transparent and

expeditious to ensure compliance to the basic rule of law.

If an investigation is conducted in an unfair manner, the accused (when indicted) may be able to

claim that he had been deprived of his fundamental right to a fair trial. Further, by the conduct of an

unfair investigation, there is every reason to believe that the truth will not surface, and in the

circumstances, the public will lose confidence in criminal law enforcement and in the criminal justice

system.

Unlawful investigations

There can be a strong causal nexus between on the one hand an unlawfully conducted investigation

and on the other hand the conviction of the accused following a trial at which investigative material

collected in the course of such unlawful investigation had been presented (as judicial evidence).

Presentation of evidence founded upon investigative material (material which has the potential of

being converted into judicial evidence at the trial) collected in the course of an unlawfully

conducted investigation can pollute the findings of the trial court and its verdict, and thereby render

such finding unlawful. That is primarily due to the possibility of highly prejudicial evidence

emanating from an unlawfully conducted investigation. Therefore, if the prosecution had relied

primarily on evidence collected in the course of an unlawfully conducted investigation, it is possible

that such evidence resulted in causing substantial prejudice to the accused and therefore resulted in

a miscarriage of justice. If in fact a miscarriage of justice had occurred, the conviction of the accused

should be set aside on the premise that the accused has been denied a fair trial. That is a situation

where the outcome of the case (conviction of the accused) has been inextricably interwoven with

the evidence presented by the prosecution which had emanated from an unlawfully conducted

investigation. Therefore, there has been a causal nexus between the unlawfully conducted

investigation and the conviction of the accused.

However, there may be situations where the investigation as a whole had been conducted in a

lawful manner, and only certain segments of it had been unlawfully conducted. An example would

be a lawful investigation into an incident of murder, where a particular search had been conducted

in an unlawful manner, and a highly incriminatory item of real (physical) evidence having been

found during such unlawful search. In such instances, the Court would have to carefully examine

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 121 of 145 and rule on the impact of such unlawfully conducted portion(s) of the investigation. What was the

impact of the search having been conducted in an unlawful manner, on the recovery of the relevant

incriminatory item of real evidence? Was evidence presented against the accused based on such

unlawfully conducted segments of the investigation? Was the testimonial narrative of the

prosecution pertaining to the recovery of such item, credible and trustworthy? Has the presentation

of material emanating from such unlawfully conducted segments of the investigation, cause grave

and irreparable prejudice to the accused resulting in a miscarriage of justice? It is the answers to

these questions, that will enable the Court to determine whether in such instances (where only a

part of the investigation had been conducted unlawfully), the accused had been denied a fair trial,

and if so, whether the conviction should be set-aside.

Conduct of the investigation by officers of the CIABOC

It is now necessary to consider whether the investigation into the complaint made to the CIABOC by

the virtual complainant Nagarajah, had been conducted in a lawful manner. In this regard,

consideration of section 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 would provide a

useful starting point.

All offences

(a) under the Penal Code,

(b) under any other law unless otherwise specifically provided for in that law or any other

law,

shall be investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the

provisions of this Code. [Emphasis added]

The offences for which the Appellants have been found guilty of committing, are offences under

the Bribery Act. The Bribery Act presently does not contain specific provisions pertaining to the

conduct of investigations into offences under the Act. [Prior to 1994, there were certain provisions,

which were repealed by Act No. 20 of 1994.]

However, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act, No. 19 of 1994,

which established the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), has

vide section 3 of the Act, entrusted such Commission the statutory functions of

(i) investigating allegations contained in communications made to the Commission

under section 4, and

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 122 of 145

(ii) where such investigation discloses the commission of any offence by any person

under the Bribery Act or the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law, No. 1 of 1975,

directing the Director General for the Prevention of Bribery or Corruption to institute

criminal proceedings against such person in the appropriate court.

It would be seen that by section 5 of the CIABOC Act, the CIABOC has been vested with certain

powers of investigation. Therefore, the Commission in the exercise of its statutory function of

investigating the alleged commission of certain offences (such as the offences the Appellants were

subsequently indicted of having committed) is entitled to exercise such powers of investigation

contained in section 5 of the CIABOC Act. However, vide section 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act, unless specifically provided in a particular law, an investigation at large should be conducted in

the manner provided for in such Code. To enable officers appointed to assist the Commission to

exercise powers of investigation contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, section 18(2) of

the CIABOC Act provides that the Director General for the Prevention of Bribery or Corruption

(referred to as the Director General of the Commission during the hearing of this Appeal) and every

officer appointed to assist the Commission shall be deemed to be peace officers within the

meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

A careful consideration of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reveals that the statutory regulation

of the conduct of an investigation is primarily found in Chapter XI of the Act. As observed by Justice

Parinda Ranasinghe in R.P. Wijesiri v. The Attorney-General, Chapter XI contains vital powers of

investigation, provisions that are sacrosanct and are invaluable safeguards against oppressive and

unlawful forms of investigations. However, it is important to note that there are several very

important provisions pertaining to the conduct of criminal investigations outside Chapter XI of the

Code as well. They are, the (i) power to conduct search operations (sections 24 to 31), (ii) powers of

arrest of suspects (sections 23, 32, 33, 34, and 42), and (iii) power to hold an arrested person in

custody (sections 37 and 43A). Additionally, when police officers conduct investigations, they are

empowered under the provisions of the Police Ordinance as well. Therefore, restricting the powers

of investigation to Chapter XI of the Code would not be correct.

A further examination of the provisions of the CIABOC Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

reveals that though the said laws suitably empower any Peace Officer or an Officer-in-Charge of

Police Station (in the context of investigations into offences under the Penal Code and various other

laws containing offences which may be investigated into by the Police) and the Commission (in the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 123 of 145 context of offences under the Bribery Act and the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law), the two

laws in conjunction do not exhaustively contain provisions of law that would regulate the conduct of

investigations. Neither of these two laws stipulate the exact modus operandi that may be adopted

when conducting an investigation. For valid reasons, determining the exact manner in which an

investigation should be conducted has been left to the ingenuity of the relevant investigators based

on circumstances relating to each investigation. The manner of conducting an investigation is to be

determined keeping in mind a host of factors such as the nature of the offence, the circumstances

pertaining to the commission of the offence that is required to be investigated into, and the need to

collect sufficient investigative material that would enable the launching of a successful prosecution.

Subject to the provisions of the afore-stated laws and circumscribed by such laws, investigation

officers have been vested with considerable discretionary authority to determine the exact manner

in which the investigation ought to be conducted and implement the conceptualized investigation

strategy in a lawful manner. Particularly with regard to complex crimes such as premeditated

murder, bribery and corruption, money laundering, and drug trafficking, law enforcement officers

would need to adopt complex investigative methodology to detect crime and to gather evidence. Of

course, when designing such investigation strategy and implementing it, investigation officers would

have to abide specifically by the applicable provisions of the afore-stated two laws and generally by

the rule of law, which would include recognizing and respecting the Fundamental Rights of suspects

and the rights and entitlements of victims of crime and witnesses. Indeed, every investigation must

be conducted in a lawful, impartial, fair, prompt and comprehensive manner, with the view to

ascertaining the truth.

Laying of a trap and entrapment as investigative techniques and their legality

Throughout the hearing of this Appeal, there was considerable debate about the investigative

technique adopted by CIABOC officials which resulted in the arrest of the appellants. While learned

Presidents Counsel for the Appellants submitted that what took place at the instance of officers of

the CIABOC was an entrapment, learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents submitted

that the investigative technique adopted by officers of the CIABOC did not amount to entrapment

and was not unlawful. Learned counsel also debated whether the modus operandi adopted by

CIABOC officers was merely laying of a trap or an entrapment. Therefore, it is now necessary to

consider (i) what a trap is as opposed to an entrapment, (ii) whether the modus operandi of

entrapment as alleged to have been adopted by the investigation officers of the Commission in the

instant case, amounted to an entrapment (iii) whether such entrapment is unlawful or illegal,

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 124 of 145 and (iv) whether in the instant case, officers of the CIABOC engaged in an entrapment and thereby

deprived the Appellants of a fair trial.

A search for answers to these questions should be viewed against the backdrop of a core submission

made by learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellants, that when the virtual complainant

Nagarajah lodged his complaint at the CIABOC, all what CIABOC officers were entitled to do in terms

of the law, was to investigate that complaint containing multiple instances of solicitation of a bribe,

and if such investigation revealed sufficient evidence against the perpetrators, take action against

them. Learned counsel submitted that instead of doing that (which is the investigative procedure

provided by law), the investigators engaged in entrapping the Appellants, which was illegal.

In my view, what was urged by learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellants as being the lawful

entitlement of investigators, was a very conventional and routine investigation: What may be

described as a simple, conventional and reactive investigation, as opposed to a proactive form of

investigation aimed at detecting the commission of an offence and gathering cogent evidence

relating to the commission of such offence.

It would be seen that not only in complex crimes such as bribery, corruption, money laundering,

terrorism, drug trafficking and online / cyber environment based criminal activities, even in

somewhat simple offences such as offences under the Food Act and the Consumer Protection

Authority Act, unless law enforcement authorities were to engage in the adoption of proactive and

innovative measures of investigation, detecting the commission of the offences, promptly arresting

the perpetrator and procuring credible and cogent evidence relating to commission of those

offences, would be extremely difficult. Further, by the adoption of simple, conventional and reactive

methods of investigation (in the nature of what was submitted by learned counsel for the Appellants

as being what was permitted by law), it is highly unlikely that the investigators would be successful

in securing sufficient investigative material that would enable the prosecutor to successfully

prosecute the offender. Therefore, in my view, what was suggested by the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Appellants as being the only method that is permissible by law, would not be in

public interest or in the furtherance of objectives of law enforcement and criminal justice. In my

opinion, what was suggested by learned Counsel for the Appellants would be a panacea for

perpetrators of crime to avoid criminal justice sanctions, and certainly not in public interest.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 125 of 145 Particularly in what may be referred to as consent crimes where there is no direct and immediate

victim and both parties had acted surreptitiously in a consensual manner, it is unlikely that law

enforcement officers will receive complaints or information pertaining to the commission of such

offences. Examples would be (i) a lay person voluntarily giving a bribe to a public officer to secure a

benefit for himself and the corresponding acceptance of that bribe by the official for his personal

gain, which results in the requested official act being successfully performed and a benefit accruing

to both the giver and the receiver of the bribe, and (ii) the sale of narcotics by a large scale drug-

trafficker to secure financial gain for himself and the corresponding purchase of such narcotics also

by a drug-trafficker or by an addict for re-sale or personal use. Unless law enforcement authorities

based on available information and crime intelligence, engage the suspected perpetrator in a

proactive manner and devise a method of apprehending the perpetrator at the very moment the

offence is committed while they themselves witness the commission of the offence, detection of

such offences, arrest of suspects and successful prosecution of offenders would not be feasible.

Contemporary law enforcement practices which include covert policing operations in the name and

style of sting operations using decoys, other forms of crime detection using decoys, test purchases,

controlled deliveries, automated detection of offences using advanced technology, and virtue

testing of fidelity to legal values using online communication channels and other methods are

adopted throughout the world. Particularly with the increase in the sophistication of commission of

crime and the use of advanced technology by criminals, law enforcement authorities have been able

to keep society relatively safe from unscrupulous criminals, mainly due to such proactive forms of

crime detection and criminal investigation.

Particularly in the field of bribery and corruption, which has most dangerously invaded the

officialdom of our country and caused (possibly continues to cause) significant damage to the

integrity of governance and devastating economic consequences, the adoption of proactive forms of

investigation (to the exclusion of what is illegal) is very much in public interest, and must be

encouraged.

Trap

According to the Oxford Advanced Learns Dictionary (10th Edition - 2020) to the extent it is

contextually relevant, a trap is a clever plan designed to trick somebody, either by capturing them

or by making them to do or say something that they did not mean to do or say. (e.g. She had set up

a trap for him and he had walked straight into it.) A trap is also a trick to get somebody into doing

something. According to the Blacks Law Dictionary (11th Edition) a trap is a devise for capturing

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 126 of 145 living creatures and that shuts suddenly. A trap has also be described as any devise or contrivance

by which one may be caught unawares.

From a crime detection perspective, a trap may be described as an innovative crime detection

method which law enforcement authorities use to nab perpetrators at the very instant the offence

is committed. It is an undercover method of criminal investigation by which a trap is laid enabling

the perpetrator to be apprehended in the act of committing the crime while ensuring that the

perpetrator has no room to extricate himself. Where investigators adopt the trap technique, the

suspected perpetrator is not apprehended (arrested) immediately following the receipt of

information or the complaint that he has committed an offence. A crime detection method referred

to as a trap is laid providing the perpetrator an opportunity to commit the substantive offence or a

further offence (if he decides to commit the substantive offence or such further offence, on his own

volition). It is the commission of the substantive or further offence that is detected by law

enforcement officers by the laying of a trap. Thus, what law enforcement officers do is to design and

create circumstances that confer on the perpetrator the opportunity to commit an offence on his

own free will. This investigative method is designed in such a manner that the suspect receives a

free opportunity to commit an offence in the immediate presence of an undercover law

enforcement officer, who is generally referred to as a decoy. The decoy is a passive observer of the

conduct of the offender and either does not engage with the offenders or engages only minimally.

The decoy offers no inducement to the suspect to commit an offence, nor does he lure him to

commit the offence. If the offender does commit an offence, the decoy either directly apprehends

the offender or signals the rest of the law enforcement personnel, and they rush to apprehend the

offender.

The laying of a trap is carried out for multiple reasons. They are, (i) to check the veracity of the

complaint / information received, (ii) to directly take cognizance of the offence being committed (as

the decoy witnesses the offence being committed), and (iii) to facilitate the perpetrator being

arrested in the act of committing the offence or immediately thereafter. This method has the

advantage of securing cogent evidence against the perpetrator, obtain corroboration of the

complainants position, preventing the offender from destroying evidence which incriminates him,

and also prevents the offender from evading arrest. Therefore, laying of traps is a well-accepted

method. Thus, it would be seen that, it will certainly not be in public interest to proscribe all forms

and manifestations of laying of traps, which do not take the manifestation and aggravated form of

entrapment (defined below). I take judicial note of the fact that, the CIABOC presently adopts the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 127 of 145 laying of traps as a routine method of detection of accepting bribes and its legality has not been

challenged in judicial proceedings. During the hearing of this Appeal, learned Counsel for the

Appellants were non-committal regarding their views on legality of laying of a trap using a decoy.

In M.S. Mohiddin v. Unknown [AIR 1952 Mad 561] (cited by learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd

Appellant) Justice Panchapakesa Ayyar has referred to two kinds of traps, namely legitimate traps

and illegitimate traps. The challenge in my view would be to draw the dividing line between traps

simpliciter that are permissible as they are lawful, as opposed to what are impermissible and thus

unlawful. However, it is important to note that basing the argument on what is lawful verses what is

unlawful based on nomenclature alone to be assigned to the impugned investigative technique can

be troublesome.

Entrapment

Entrapment as an investigative technique, which was at the epicenter of the argument in this

Appeal, is a term which does not find a statutory definition in Sri Lankan law (both written and

unwritten law). Learned Counsel did not bring to the attention of this Court a statutory definition of

the term found in a statute of a comparable jurisdiction.

In the foregoing circumstances, it would be logical to commence the search for a definition of the

term by ascertaining the literal meaning of the term entrapment. According to the Oxford

Advanced Learners Dictionary (10th Edition - 2020) entrapment means the illegal act of tricking

somebody into committing a crime so that he can be arrested for it. Other language dictionaries

offer similar literal meanings.

The logical next step would be to refer legal dictionaries. According to the MerriamWebsters

Dictionary of Law, entrapment is the action or process of entrapping and the state or condition of

being entrapped. The term has also been defined as the affirmative defence of having been

entrapped by an agent of the government. According to the Blacks Law Dictionary (11th Edition),

entrapment is a law enforcement officers or government agents inducement of a person to commit

a crime, by means of fraud or undue persuasion in an attempt to cause a criminal prosecution

against that person.

All counsel were unanimous in their position that judicial pronouncements of this country do not

contain a definition of the term entrapment. In the circumstances, it is necessary to consider

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 128 of 145 judicial interpretations found in judgments of comparable jurisdictions. As referred to above,

learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Appellant brought to the attention of this Court a possible

definition of the term, found in Sorrells v. United States 287 US 435 (1932), which provides that

entrapment is the conception and planning of an offence by an officer and his procurement of its

commission by one who would not have perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion or fraud of

the officer . Learned Deputy Solicitor General did not oppose this definition.

In the English case of R. v. Frank Alexander Birtles [(1969) 53 Cr.A.R. 469], Lord Parker, CJ has, in an

instance where the informer had created the commission of an offence by inciting the accused to

commit an offence which he would not have otherwise committed, held that "it is vitally important

to ensure so far as possible that the informer does not create an offence, that is to say, incite others

to commit an offence which those others would not otherwise have committed." These words reflect

Lord Chief Justice Parker's views on what entrapment means. In the South African case of S. v

Malinga [(1963) 1 S.A.L.R.692] Justice Holmes has defined that a person may be referred to as a

"trap" which such "person who with a view to securing the conviction of another, proposes certain

criminal conduct to him, and himself ostensibly takes part therein. In other words, he creates the

occasion for someone else to commit the offence." In the Canadian case of R. v. Haukness, [(1976) 5

W.W.R. 420], entrapment has been defined as the act of an officer who induces a person to

commit a crime, not contemplated by such person, for the purpose of prosecuting him .

Upon a consideration of the literal meaning of the English term entrapment, definitions found in

legal dictionaries, and judicial pronouncements of comparable jurisdictions, without intending to

provide an exhaustive definition, it is my view that entrapment is a process which is associated

with the conduct of certain forms of criminal investigations, where one or more law enforcement

officers in collaboration with or without the participation of a lay person, engages in the conduct

of one or more activities not associated with routine and conventional criminal investigations, for

the purpose of inducing or enticing another person to commit a crime. Such stratagem may take

the form of instigation, enticement, inveigling, applying duress or luring. As a result of such

stratagem, the offender commits an offence, which he did not originally intend to commit. The

result of causing the offender to commit an offence is achieved by deception or fraud. As a result

of such stratagem and upon being deceived, the offender commits the offence he was instigated,

enticed, inveigled or lured into committing. Consequent to the commission of the offence, the

offender is arrested forthwith.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 129 of 145 Thus, it would also be seen that entrapment is an aggravated manifestation of laying of a trap. In

an entrapment, in addition to the routine features of laying a trap, investigators engage in certain

measures by the application of stratagem, so as to induce or lure the offender to commit an offence

which he would not have otherwise committed. In other words, investigators not only set in place

circumstances that confer on the offender an opportunity to commit and offence, they create the

commission of the offence, as well.

Generally, entrapment is carried out by an agent provocateur. An agent provocateur is a person

who entices another to commit an express breach of the law, which that person would not have

otherwise committed, and then proceed to inform against him in respect of such offence to a law

enforcement agency or to a Court. An agent provocateur could be a law enforcement officer or a lay

person who acts in terms of advice or instructions given by a law enforcement officer. It is

noteworthy that in entrapment, certain forms of interventions by law enforcement officers, are per-

se criminal activities. Examples would be abetting the commission of an offence or conspiracy to

commit an offence. Those are instances where the law enforcement officer concerned and or the

agent provocateurs conduct forms the actus reus of an offence. However, in certain other

entrapments, interventions by the agent provocateur do not constitute the actus reus of any

offence. Notwithstanding the possible blameworthiness of the conduct of the agent provocateur, it

is necessary to note that in entrapment, the motive of law enforcement officers is to detect and

apprehend a person whom they believe has engaged in criminal activity. They do not entertain any

criminal intent on their part.

It is thus seen that, in a case of entrapment, what led to the perpetrator to commit the ingredients

of the offence, was a form of intervention necessarily associated with deception practiced upon him

by law enforcement officers or by a lay person acting at the behest of law enforcement officers. As a

result of the intervention, the perpetrator commits an offence which he would not have committed

if not for such intervention. These features of entrapment distinguish itself from a trap

simpliciter.

In Nottingham City Council v. Amin [(2000) 1 WLR 1071], it was held that the nature of the offence,

the reason for the particular police operation, the nature and extent of police participation in the

crime, and the character of the accused, are factors among others that may be taken into

consideration in determining whether a particular conduct of the law enforcement officers is

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 130 of 145 acceptable or not. It was further held that this was not an exhaustive list of factors and that their

relative weight and importance depends on the facts of each case.

Though in order to justify a particular modus operandi adopted by them to investigate a crime, law

enforcement officers may advance the proposition that recourse was had to the impugned

procedure for the purpose of detecting a person in the act of committing an offence and that they

acted in good faith, the legality of such modus operandi needs to be carefully considered.

Legal implications arising out of entrapment

The legal implications arising out of entrapment has been discussed in the English case of R v Sang

[(1980) AC 402], which was referred to by all Counsel and by the trial court. In this case, while Sang

had been a prisoner detained at the Brixton prison, he met a fellow prisoner called Scippo who

unknown to Sang, was a police informant and served in this instance as an agent provocateur.

Shortly before Sang was about to be released from prison, Scippo who seemed to think that Sangs

business or part of it was to deal in forged banknotes, told Sang that he knew of a safe buyer of

forged banknotes and that he would arrange for this buyer to get in touch with Sang by telephone.

Soon after Sang left the prison, he was telephoned by a man who posed as a keen buyer of forged

banknotes and enquired whether Sang would sell him some. Sang responded that he would, and at

a subsequent meeting between the two, the deal was to be completed. Sang had no idea that the

man with whom he had been speaking, was, in fact a sergeant of the police. Sang and some of his

associates went to the meeting carrying with them a large number of forged USD banknotes and

walked straight into a police trap. The forged notes were confiscated and Sang and his comrades in

crime were arrested. Subsequently, Sang and another were charged with conspiracy to utter

counterfeit banknotes and with unlawful possession of the same.

At the trial, the trial judge ruled that he had no discretion to exclude evidence obtained through an

agent provocateur and after trial, convicted Sang. The Court of Appeal dismissed Sangs Appeal.

However, the following question was certified as being fit for consideration by the House of Lords:

Does a trial judge have a discretion to refuse to allow evidence-being other than evidence of

admission-to be given in any circumstances in which such evidence is relevant and of more than

minimal probative value?

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 131 of 145 The House of Lords affirmed the view of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). It was held that

there was no justification for the exercise of the judges discretion to exclude evidence, whether or

not it had been obtained as a result of the activities of an agent provocateur. Accordingly, the

appeal was dismissed. In the course of the judgment, the Court enunciated the following principles:

There is no defence called entrapment known to English Law. The fact that the procurer of

the offence (agent provocateur) is a policeman or a police informer cannot affect the guilt of

the principal offender, although it may be of relevance in mitigation of penalty for the

offence. Both the physical element (actus reus) and the mental element (mens rea) of the

offence with which the accused has been charged are present in this case.

Incitement is no defence in law for the person incited to crime, even though the inciter is

himself guilty of crime and may be far the more culpable. There are other more direct, less

anomalous ways of controlling police and official activity than by introducing so dubious a

defence into the law. The true relevance of official entrapment is upon the question of

sentence where its mitigating value may be high.

A trial judge in a criminal trial has always a discretion to refuse to admit evidence pertaining

to entrapment, if in his opinion its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.

Save with regard to admissions and confessions and generally with regard to evidence

obtained from the accused after the commission of the offence, the trial judge has no

discretion to refuse to admit relevant and admissible evidence on the ground that it was

obtained by improper or unfair means. The court is not concerned with how it was obtained.

It is no ground for the exercise of discretion to exclude that the evidence was obtained as

the result of the activities of an agent provocateur.

Fair in this context relates to process of trial. No man is to be compelled to incriminate

himself; No man is to be convicted save upon the probative effect of legally admissible

evidence. No admission or confession is to be received in evidence unless such admission or

confession was made voluntarily. If legally admissible evidence be tendered which endangers

these principles, the judge may exercise his discretion to exclude it, thus ensuring that the

accused has the benefit of principles which exist in the law to secure him a fair trial.

Lord Diplock answered the afore-stated question of law, in the following manner:

A trial judge may, at his discretion, exclude such evidence pertaining to an entrapment only

where its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value or where the evidence has been

obtained from the accused after the commission of the offence, as in cases of admissions

and confessions.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 132 of 145

Thus, it is evident that R v. Sang has been decided on the premise that procuring evidence through

entrapment does not per-se make such evidence inadmissible against the accused. Nor is

entrapment an exculpatory defence. If at all, it will have the effect of mitigating the sentence. The

view of the Court was that admissibility of evidence procured through entrapment should be

determined based on relevancy, admissibility and the probative value of such evidence, and should

not be necessarily excluded.

In Regina v. Loosely and The Attorney Generals Reference, No. 3 of 2000 [(2001) UKHL 53] (which

were two conjoined appeals), the House of Lords revisited the law regarding this matter. Much of

the very interesting and argumentative debate during the hearing of the instant Appeal centered

around the ratio decidendi of the judgment of the House of Lords and its applicability to the facts

and circumstances of the instant case.

In R v Looseley, during the course of an authorized police operation relating to the trade in class-A

controlled drugs, an undercover police officer who was at a public house, was given the defendants

(Looseleys) name and telephone number as a potential source of drugs. The officer telephoned

Looseley who confirmed that he could obtain drugs. After they had agreed on a price for the supply

of heroin, the defendant took the officer to an address where the defendant obtained a quantity of

heroin and gave it to the officer in exchange for the agreed sum. On two further occasions, the

officer contacted the defendant and bought two more quantities of heroin from him. The defendant

was charged with supplying or being concerned in the supplying to another of a class-A controlled

drug, contrary to section 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The trial judge declined to stay

proceedings as an abuse of process of court or to exclude the evidence under section 78 of the

Police and Criminal Evidence Act. The Court of Appeal upheld the judges ruling and dismissed the

defendants appeal against conviction. The House of Lords held that there was no objection to the

police posing as drug users to trap an active drug dealer.

In Attorney Generals Reference (No. 3 of 2000), two undercover police officers offered contraband

cigarettes to a youth. The youth took the officers to the accused (who was introduced as a potential

buyer), who paid for the cigarettes. The officers then asked the accused if he could supply them with

some heroin. At first the accused said he could not get heroin at such short notice and that he was

not into heroin. But eventually he agreed to try and get them some. A few days later, he took the

officers to meet the supplier, collected the heroin and gave it to the officers in exchange of 475

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 133 of 145 pounds. When he was subsequently arrested and interviewed, he said that because the officers

were getting him cheap cigarettes, he thought that supplying heroin amounted to a favour for a

favour. He did not suggest that the officers exerted pressure of any kind. The accused was charged

with supplying to another, a class-A controlled drug contrary to section 4 of the 971 Act. The trial

judge stayed proceedings on the ground that the police officers had incited the commission of the

offence and that based on jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, held that

permitting the evidence to be admitted would deprive the accused of the right to a fair hearing as

guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental

Freedoms. When the stay was lifted and the prosecution offered no evidence, the accused was

acquitted. On reference by the Attorney-General, the Court of Appeal ruled that the trial Judge had

erred in staying proceedings. In the House of Lords, it was held that there was an abuse of process

where the defendant, who had never dealt in drugs was induced to procure heroin for an

undercover officer by the prospect of a profitable trade in smuggled cigarettes the police had

caused him to commit an offence which he would not otherwise have committed.

It is important to note that during the intervening period between the judgments in Sang and

Loosely and AGs Reference 3 of 2000, several significant developments occurred in the United

Kingdom, which seems to have had an influence on the outcome of the two conjoined Appeals. They

were, (i) the enactment of the Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Act of 1984, in which section 74

provides for the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence on the footing that it would be unfair to

adduce it, (ii) the pronouncements of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in Ludi

v. Switzerland [(1992) 15 E.H.R.R. 201] and Texeira de Castro v. Portugal [(1998) 28 E.H.R.R. 101]

where investigations conducted by the police amounting to entrapment were viewed from the

context of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights and determined by that Court as

having deprived the accused of a fair trial, (iii) the decision of the House of Lords in R v. Latif and

Shahzad [(1996) 2 Cr.App.R. 92], and (iv) the enactment of the Human Rights Act of 1998 of the

United Kingdom, of which Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair trial.

In R v. Loosely and AGs Reference 3 of 2000, the primary questions before the House of Lords

were, (i) whether entrapment was illegal and thus whether evidence pertaining to an entrapment is

inadmissible, and (ii) when an attempt is made by the prosecution to present evidence procured

through entrapment, whether proceedings should be stayed or the impugned item of evidence

should be excluded.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 134 of 145 Particularly in view of the divergence of views expressed by learned Counsel during the hearing of

this Appeal regarding the ratio decidendi to be deducted from the opinions of the several Lords who

heard these two conjoined appeals, in my view, the following detailed reproduction of the principles

of law (as contained below) found in the composite judgment of the House of Lords Loosely and

AGs Reference 3 of 2000 along with the corresponding observations and comments contained in

the several opinions of their Lordships, is quite justified.

(1) It is not acceptable that the state through its agents should lure its citizens into committing

acts forbidden by the law and then seek to prosecute them for doing so. Such conduct would

amount to entrapment, which would be a misuse of state power and an abuse of process of

court.

(2) By recourse to the principle that every court has an inherent power and duty to prevent

abuse of its process, the courts can ensure that agents of the Executive of the state do not so

misuse the coercive law enforcement functions of the courts and thereby oppress citizens.

(3) As to where the boundary lies in respect of acceptable police behaviour and what is

unacceptable, each case must depend on its own facts. A useful guide to identifying the

limits of the type of police conduct that is acceptable is to consider whether, in the particular

circumstances, the police did no more than present the defendant with an unexceptional

opportunity to commit a crime. The yardstick is, in general, whether the conduct of the

police preceding the commission of the offence was no more than might have been

expected from others in the circumstances; if not, then the police were not to be regarded as

having instigated or incited the crime; if they did no more than others might be expected to

do, they were not creating crime artificially. However, the investigatory technique of

providing an opportunity to commit the crime should not be applied at random fashion or be

used for wholesale virtue testing without good reason. The greater the degree of

intrusiveness, the closer will the court scrutinize the reason for using it. The ultimate

consideration is whether the conduct of the law enforcement agency is so seriously

improper as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The use of proactive

techniques is needed more, and is hence more appropriate, in some circumstances than

others; the secrecy and difficulty of detection and the manner in which the particular

criminal activity is carried on being relevant considerations.

(4) The difficulty lies in identifying conduct which is caught by such imprecise words as lure or

incite or entice or instigate. If police officers acted only as detectives and passive

observers, there would be little problem in identifying the boundary between permissible

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 135 of 145

and impermissible police conduct. But that would not be a satisfactory place for the

boundary line.

(5) Moreover, and importantly, in some instances a degree of active involvement by the police

in the commission of a crime is generally regarded as acceptable. Test purchases fall easily

into this category.

(6) Thus, there are occasions when it is necessary for the police to resort to investigatory

techniques in which the police themselves are the reporters and the witnesses of the

commission of a crime. Sometimes, the particular technique adopted is acceptable.

Sometimes it is not. For even when the use of these investigatory techniques is justified,

there are limits to what is acceptable.

(7) The fact that the evidence was obtained by entrapment does not of itself require the judge

to exclude it. But, in deciding whether to admit the evidence of an undercover police officer,

the judge may take into account matters such as whether the officer was enticing the

defendant to commit an offence he would not otherwise have committed, the nature of any

entrapment, and how active or passive was the officer's role in obtaining the evidence.

(8) The judiciary should accept a responsibility for the maintenance of the rule of law that

embraces a willingness to oversee executive action and to refuse to countenance behaviour

that 'threatens either basic human rights or the rule of law'.

(9) Entrapment, and the use of evidence obtained by entrapment ('as a result of police

incitement'), may deprive an accused of the right to a fair trial. Although entrapment is not a

substantive defence, English law has now developed remedies in respect of entrapment: the

court may stay the relevant criminal proceedings, and the court may exclude evidence.

(10) Entrapment is not a matter going only to the blameworthiness or culpability of the

defendant and, hence, to sentence as distinct from conviction. Entrapment goes to the

propriety of there being a prosecution at all for the relevant offence, having regard to the

state's involvement in the circumstance in which it was committed.

(11) Expressions such as state-created crime and lure and incite focus attention on the

role played by the police in the formation of the defendants intent to commit the crime in

question. If the defendant already had the intent to commit a crime of the same or a similar

kind, then the police did no more than give him the opportunity to fulfil his existing intent.

This is unobjectionable. If the defendant was already presently disposed to commit such a

crime, should opportunity arise, that is not entrapment. That is not state-created crime. The

matter stands differently if the defendant lacked such a predisposition, and the police were

responsible for implanting the necessary intent.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 136 of 145

(12) The overall consideration is always whether the conduct of the police or other law

enforcement agency was so seriously improper as to bring the administration of justice into

disrepute.

(13) The use of pro-active techniques is more needed and, hence, more appropriate, in

some circumstances than others. The secrecy and difficulty of detection, and the manner in

which the particular criminal activity is carried on, are relevant considerations.

(14) It is necessary to consider the reason for the particular police operation. It goes

without saying that the police must act in good faith and not, for example, as part of a

malicious vendetta against an individual or group of individuals. Having reasonable grounds

for suspicion is one-way good faith may be established, but having grounds for suspicion of a

particular individual is not always essential. Sometimes suspicion may be centered on a

particular place, such as a particular public house. Sometimes random testing may be the

only practicable way of policing a particular trading activity.

(15) The greater the inducement held out by the police, and the more forceful or

persistent the police overtures, the more readily may a court conclude that the police

overstepped the boundary: their conduct might well have brought about commission of a

crime by a person who would normally avoid crime of that kind. In assessing the weight to be

attached to the police inducement, regard is to be had to the accuseds circumstances,

including his vulnerability. This is not because the standards of acceptable behaviour are

variable. Rather, this is a recognition that what may be a significant inducement to one

person may not be so to another. For the police to behave as would an ordinary customer of

a trade, whether lawful or unlawful, being carried on by the defendant will not normally be

regarded as objectionable.

(16) The fact that the accused was entrapped is not inconsistent with his having broken

the law. The entrapment will usually have achieved its object in causing him to do the

prohibited act with the necessary guilty intent.

(17) Many cases place emphasis upon the question of whether the policeman can be said

to have caused the commission of the offence, rather than merely providing an opportunity

for the accused to commit it with a policeman rather than in secrecy with someone else.

There is no doubt that this will usually be a most important factor in deciding whether or not

the police have overstepped the line between legitimate crime detection and unacceptable

crime creation.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 137 of 145

(18) The only proper purpose of police participation is to obtain evidence of criminal acts

which they suspect someone is about to commit or in which he is already engaged. It is not

to tempt people to commit crimes in order to expose their bad characters and punish them.

(19) Closely linked with the question of whether the police were creating or detecting

crime is the supervision of their activities. To allow policemen or controlled informers to

undertake entrapment activities unsupervised carries great danger, not merely that they will

try to improve their performances in court, but of oppression, extortion and corruption.

(20) The remedy where entrapment has occurred is not a substantive defence. It had also

been held that entrapment gives rise to a mitigatory plea in so far as the sentence is

concerned. However, in view of section 78 of the PACE Act of 1984 and the Human Rights

Act of 1998, this approach must be modified. The phrase fairness of proceedings in section

78 of the PACE Act is directed primarily at matters going into the fairness of the actual

conduct of proceedings. However, the scope of the wide and comprehensive discretion

conferred on trial judges should not be strictly to procedural unfairness and can justify the

exclusion of evidence pertaining to entrapment.

Present status of the English law on entrapment

In view of the foregoing, it is evident that the law relating to entrapment as laid down in R v. Sang

has been reversed by the House of Lords by their judgment in the conjoined Appeals of R v. Loosely

and AGs Reference (No. 3 of 2000). The House of Lords has held that entrapment amounts to an

abuse of power conferred on law enforcement and investigation officers. Permitting entrapment to

take place is an afront to the integrity of criminal justice and is contrary to public policy. It is inimical

to the rule of law, and hence cannot be condoned. Entrapment causes the creation of an offence,

that is, in entrapment the offender commits an offence which he would not have otherwise

committed. (It should be noted that, creating crime is different from creating circumstances that

provides a mere opportunity to commit crime.) In the circumstances, entrapment (the parameters

of which have been laid down in the several opinions of the Lords, as being distinguishable from

lawful proactive forms of investigation which would include the laying of traps simpliciter) as a

form of investigative technique is not lawful under English common law. Nevertheless, entrapment

is not a substantive defence in English law. Evidence emanating from an entrapment would impinge

on the right of an accused to a fair trial. Therefore, such evidence should not be permitted to be led

in evidence.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 138 of 145 During the hearing of this Appeal, learned counsel did not bring to the attention of this Court any

subsequent judgment of the House of Lords or the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom which

reflects that the English common law on this matter has changed since the judgment in R v. Loosely.

Nor did a scrutiny of the English law by me reveal such a development. I have considered the

judgment of the Court of Appeal (UK) in Haroon Ali Syed v. Regina, [(2018) EWCA Crim 2809], and it

is my view that English common law on this matter remains that which is contained in R v. Loosely

and AGs Reference 3 of 2000.

Position of Sri Lankas law regarding entrapment

I find myself in agreement with the afore-stated principles of law contained in R v. Loosely and AGs

Reference (No. 3 of 2000). Adoption of these principles into Sri Lankas law is wholly consistent with

the law and procedure pertaining to criminal justice of this country and is in perfect consonance

with the fundamental right to a fair trial. Thus, without any hesitation, I apply those principles in

the adjudication of the instant Appeal.

In the present Appeal, the determination of the question of law referred to at the commencement

of this judgment is not based only on the unlawfulness of the investigative method of entrapment.

The related and more important issue in my opinion is whether permitting a prosecution to present

evidence emanating from entrapment would be fair and therefore, permissible.

In a situation where the offender had been entrapped, the intention on the part of the offender to

commit the offence is not based on his free will and own volition and independent decision-making.

The intention to commit the offence is the result of the stratagem applied on the offender by the

agent provocateur. The offender did not on his own free will intend to commit the offence. He was

influenced to commit an offence which if left alone to himself, he would not have committed. The

offence is committed by the offender influenced by or due to the inducement, incitement or duress

provided or as a result of being lured into committing the offence by the agent provocateur. The

formation of the mens rea of the offence arises out of the intervention by the agent provocateur.

Thus, though the requisite mens rea is entertained by the offender and the actus reus of the offence

is completed by him, the modus operandi adopted by the agent provocateur and the investigators

cannot be endorsed. In a case of entrapment, law enforcement personnel and or the agent

provocateur are responsible for the creation of the offence perpetrated by the offender. If not for

their design and intervention aimed at the commission of the offence, the offender would not have

committed the offence he has been subsequently charged with. Thus, in situations where

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 139 of 145 entrapment has taken place and such entrapment had resulted in the accused committing the

offence, it would be manifestly unfair to prosecute him founded upon evidence arising out of the

entrapment. That is because, presenting such evidence would be grossly unfair. In my view, that is

the justification for the policy and rationale in outlawing evidence emanating from entrapment.

In view of the foregoing, I hold that the investigative technique of entrapment as defined in this

judgment, is unlawful to the extent that, it is an abuse of the powers of investigation conferred on

law enforcement officials, is an affront to the rule of law as it amounts to conspiracy or abetment

to commit an offence or luring another to commit an offence. Doing so which results in creating

the commission of an offence which the offender would not have if not for being entrapped

committed, is not in public interest, is against public conscience, has the potential of bringing the

system of criminal justice into disrepute, and carries the distinct possibility of depriving an

accused of a fair trial.

However, following English law, I hold that entrapment is not an exculpatory defence, as

entrapment does not negative criminal responsibility.

It is unlawful for investigators to engage in entrapment, and is thus an unlawful investigative

technique. Therefore, adoption of entrapment as an investigative technique is a violation of the

rule of law. An investigation which predominantly takes the form of an entrapment is an unlawful

investigation. As a lawful investigation is a prerequisite for a fair trial, an entrapment gives rise to

the distinct possibility of the accused being deprived of a fair trial. If detected during the trial

stage, the duty of the trial judge is to exclude evidence emanating from an entrapment. If alleged

and proven during the appellate stage that evidence emanating from an entrapment had been led

by the prosecution during the corresponding trial, the responsibility of the appellate judge is to

consider the impact of the evidence that had emanated from such entrapment, and quash the

conviction and acquit the accused, if the reception of such evidence at the trial had deprived the

accused appellant of a fair trial resulting in a miscarriage of justice.

Did the manner in which the investigation was carried out by officers of the CIABOC, amount to

entrapment?

What is now left to be determined is whether, the conduct of CIABOC officials and the virtual

complainant (at the instance of CIABOC officials) amounted to entrapment which by its very nature

and impact, in the circumstances of this case, would have deprived the Appellants of a fair trial.

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 140 of 145

In this regard, it is necessary to note that, the Accused Appellants in their testimonies did not

plead that they were entrapped to commit the offences they were accused of committing. Such a

suggestion was not even made by the defence to prosecution witnesses. Nor did learned Counsel for

the Appellants submit to this Court that the Appellants had committed the offences they were

indicted of having committed, because they were entrapped. What was submitted on behalf of the

Appellants was that CIABOC officers and the virtual complainant had engaged in entrapment which

resulted in the Appellants being arrested and subsequently prosecuted. Thus, the Court is left with

only the testimonial narrative of the prosecution to determine whether the Appellants had been

entrapped and thereby deprived of a fair trial. In this regard, the following items of evidence,

related circumstances and necessary inferences are of particular relevance:

(i) Well before the virtual complainant complained to the Prime Ministers office and

thereafter met with and made a statement to the CIABOC, the 1st Appellant had on or

about 11th August 2016, solicited a bribe of USD 3 million from the virtual complainant

Nagarajah. The solicitation related to a matter that the virtual complainant was

legitimately interested in getting attended to, namely facilitating the process of handing

over to MG Sugars Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd (a company he was interested in) the plant and

machinery of the Kantale Sugar Factory, which was a condition specified in the

Shareholders Agreement which the investor company entered into with the Government

of Sri Lanka.

(ii) Thereafter, the 1st Appellant had on 27th February 2017 and 5th September 2017,

repeatedly solicited bribes from the virtual complainant. On those occasions too, there

was no enticement on the part of the virtual complainant which can be alleged by the

Appellants as having resulted in the 1st Appellant soliciting such bribes.

(iii) The virtual complainant did not give the 1st Appellant the solicited bribe. In response

thereof, the 1st Appellant did not concede to the legitimate entitlement of MG Sugars

Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd to receive the ownership of the old plant and machinery of the Kantale

Sugar factory. Thus, in February 2018, as at the time the virtual complainant got in touch

with CIABOC officials, the matter the virtual complainant was interested in remained

unresolved and pending. At no time between the solicitation and the virtual complainant

having come into contact with CIABOC officials did the 1st Appellant withdraw the

solicitation or state that he was no longer interested in receiving a bribe for the work the

virtual complainant requested him to attend to. Thus, it is important to take note of the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 141 of 145

fact that the 1st Appellants predisposition to commit the offence of acceptance of a

bribe remained active, notwithstanding the lapse of time between the last solicitation

prior to the complaint being made to CIABOC and the time the virtual complainant got in

touch with CIABOC officials in February 2018, when the virtual complainant lodged the

complaint.

(iv) The 2nd Appellants involvement in facilitating the 1st Appellant to receive the bribe

commenced in September 2017, prior to the virtual complainant coming into contact

with CIABOC officials. That was founded upon an initiative by the 2nd Appellant.

(v) The involvement of CIABOC officials commenced in February, 2018.

(vi) The virtual complainant was not under instructions by officers of the CIABOC to incite or

lure the Appellants to commit any offence. Nor did he do so. However, on the advice of

CIABOC officials, the virtual complainant contacted the 2nd Appellant by telephoning him.

At the ensuing meeting, the virtual complainant told the 2nd Appellant that he was willing

to pay a bribe to the 1st Appellant. In that regard, all what Nagaraja did was to inform the

2nd Appellant that he was willing to accede to the demand of the 1st Appellant. In

response, the 2nd Appellant proposed that a bribe of Rs. 450 million be given to the 1st

Appellant. At no stage did the 2nd Appellant indicate directly or otherwise that neither he

nor the 1st Appellant were interested in receiving a bribe from the virtual complainant.

Thus, the virtual complainant did not lure in the Appellants to accept a bribe. All what

the virtual complainant did was to provide an opportunity to the Appellants to commit

further offences. Further, these circumstances clearly point towards the continuation of

the intent and pre-existing predisposition of the Appellants to commit the offence of

acceptance of a bribe.

(vii) The initial use of a decoy (an under-cover CIABOC officer) was limited to ascertaining

the veracity of the complaint made by the virtual complainant to the CIABOC.

Throughout the series of events that followed culminating in the acceptance of the bribe

at the car park of the Taj Samudra Hotel, the decoy was a passive observer and did not

instigate or lure either of the Appellants to commit an offence.

(viii) At meetings between the virtual complainant and the two Appellants, the bribe had been

reduced to Rs. 100 million, and Rs. 20 million was to be initially paid as an advance. These

changes took place at the instance of the Appellants.

(ix) On 3rd May 2018 when the Appellants met with the virtual complainant in the lobby of

the Taj Samudra Hotel, neither by word nor deed, did the virtual complainant or the

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 142 of 145

decoy lure, encourage, entice or apply duress on either of the Appellants to accept a

bribe.

(x) The acceptance of the bribe of Rs. 20 million by the 1st Appellant was a purely voluntary

act on the part of the 1st Appellant. Such acceptance was the culmination of a series of

events which commenced from the original solicitation of a bribe of USD 3 million.

(xi) When the Appellants were arrested the same day soon after they accepted the bribe

from the virtual complainant (at the time when they were inside the car of the virtual

complainant which was in the car park of the Taj Samudra Hotel), the role of CIABOC

officers was purely law enforcement in nature. The CIABOC officers or the virtual

complainant did not thrust the money upon either of the Appellants. The role of the

decoy was passive, and to use terminology of the learned Deputy Solicitor General,

pedestrian like.

(xii) As at the time the virtual complainant complained to CIABOC, the only reason as to why

the 1st Appellant had not committed the offence of accepting a bribe, was due to the fact

that the virtual complainant was not willing to give the 1st Appellant the solicited bribe.

It is also seen from the above-mentioned sequence of events that at no time during the afore-stated

events did any CIABOC officer entice, incite or lure either of the Appellants to solicit or accept a

bribe. CIABOC officers did not advice the virtual complainant to do so either. Nor did the virtual

complainant conduct himself in such a manner. What was done by CIABOC officers and the virtual

complainant was to provide an opportunity to the Appellants to fulfil their intent. They did nothing

to takeaway or limit the exercise of free will or discretion by the Appellants. The Appellants

immediately took advantage of the opportunity that was given.

At the time the virtual complainant got in touch with the 2nd Appellant (sequel to the virtual

complainant having met CIABOC officers following the complaint,), his utterance to the 2nd

Appellant was limited to informing him that he (the virtual complainant) was willing to pay the bribe

which the 1st Appellant had solicited from him. The 2nd Appellant immediately responded by

suggesting that the virtual complainant pays a bribe of Rs. 450 million. If by that time, the 1st

Appellant had given up his original intention of receiving a bribe from the virtual complainant and

the 2nd Appellant was not interested in facilitating the 1st Appellant receiving a bribe from the virtual

complainant, there was no reason for the 2nd Appellant to have made the afore-stated suggestion

and for the 2nd Appellant to have arranged a meeting between the virtual complainant and the 1st

Appellant. Further, unless the 1st Appellant remained interested in receiving a bribe from the virtual

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 143 of 145 complainant, the 1st Appellant would not have participated in the meeting arranged by the 2nd

Appellant held on 27th February 2018. Furthermore, the conversation at that meeting had

commenced seamlessly from where the parties concluded the last meeting before the virtual

complainant complained to CIABOC. At that meeting, the virtual complainant did not have to

persuade or encourage the 1st Appellant to accept a bribe. The 1st Appellant solicited a bribe of Rs.

100 million with Rs. 20 million to be paid as an advance.

Prosecution evidence relating to events that took place between 27th February and 3rd May 2018,

clearly points towards the interest and keenness on the part of the 1st and 2nd Appellants to receive

a bribe from the virtual complainant. The events of 3rd May 2018 show clearly the initiative taken by

the 1st and 2nd Appellants to receive the bribe of Rs. 20 million from the virtual complainant. On that

final occasion too, there was no inducement on the part of the virtual complainant. His conduct was

limited to handing over to the 1st Appellant the solicited bribe of Rs. 20 million. The role of the

decoy was observatory in nature. He did not by any utterance or action on his part lure the

Appellants to accept the bribe. The role of the other officers of the CIABOC was non-intrusive in

nature. During the covert operation they took part in, their role was limited to observing the

occurrences keenly and apprehending the Appellants no sooner the bribe was accepted.

Thus, it is beyond doubt that, the events which resulted in the 1st Appellant with the assistance of

the 2nd Appellant having accepted a bribe of Rs. 20 million, was purely due to voluntary conduct on

the part of the two Appellants, and CIABOC officers along with the virtual complainant had not

participated in an entrapment as alleged on behalf of the Appellants. There had been neither

illegality nor abuse of power in the manner the officers of the CIABOC conducted the investigation.

In view of the foregoing factual circumstances, neither the officers of the CIABOC who conducted

the investigation nor the virtual complainant Nagarajah can be classified as agents provocateurs, as

they did not create an offence by enticing or luring the Appellants to commit an offence. They

merely provided an unexceptional opportunity to the Appellants to commit a further ensuing

offence.

The modus operandi adopted by the officers of the CIABOC does not violate the scheme and

provisions of the CIABOC Act and the applicable provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. As

observed by me previously, provisions of those two laws do not lay down investigative techniques to

be adopted when conducting an investigation. Apart from laying down certain vital provisions of law

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 144 of 145 pertaining to the conduct of investigations (which investigators are obliged to comply with) and

powers of investigations, the law does not specify the practical manner in which an investigation

ought to be conducted (modus operandi to be adopted when conducting an investigation). Based on

the nature of the complaint received, the offence, the investigative material that can be gathered at

that point of time, nature and degree of corroboration or the absence thereof of the complainants

narrative, and the propensity of the alleged perpetrator committing further offences, it is up to the

investigator to determine whether the suspect should be interviewed and arrested forthwith or to

delay the arrest pending further investigative steps being taken in good-faith and in a manner that

would not infringe the law, while keeping in mind the ultimate objective of conducting a successful

investigation in terms of the law. In the circumstances, the arrest of the alleged offender can be

delayed up to a strategic moment when the suspect making use of an unexceptional opportunity

provided by the investigator commits an ensuing further offence, enabling the commission of such

offence being spontaneously detected and the suspect being arrested in the immediate aftermath

of such subsequent offence being committed.

In this instance, the investigators of the CIABOC had decided to conduct further investigations with

the view to ascertaining the veracity of the complaint, and should the occasion arise, to arrest the

suspects at the time they commit the offence of acceptance of the solicited bribe. Their conduct was

unexceptional, and was limited to providing an opportunity to the Appellants to commit an ensuing

offence which they in any event intended to commit. The motive of the investigators was achieved,

as subsequent investigative steps taken by them enabled them to conclude that the complainants

version of events was credible. Further, they were successful in apprehending the Appellants in the

act of committing the ensuing offence, which in this instance was the acceptance of a bribe.

Therefore, I am of the view that the investigative technique adopted by officers of the CIABOC was

not in violation of the applicable statutory framework, did not amount to an entrapment and

therefore was lawful. Further, I do not see CIABOC officers having abused their authority or by

themselves having committed an offence or acted with a personal or malicious vendetta against the

Appellants. There is nothing in the conduct of CIABOC officers or the virtual complainant Nagarajah

that would shock the conscience of the public or bring the criminal justice system into disrepute.

Their conduct is not contrary to the notions of fairness, particularly as the commission of an offence

was not created by them. Nor were the Appellants deprived of their own free will.

In view of the foregoing, while expressing agreement with the submissions made by the learned

Deputy Solicitor General, I conclude that the investigative technique adopted by the CIABOC does

[SC TAB 1A and 1B/2020] - Page 145 of 145 not amount to an entrapment and that the Appellants have not been deprived of a fair trial.

Therefore, I hold that the Appellants fundamental right guaranteed under Article 13(3) of the

Constitution has not been infringed, and hence there exists no basis in fact or in law to set aside the

conviction of the Appellants.

I wish to acknowledge with appreciation the invaluable submissions made by learned Presidents

Counsel for the Appellants and the learned Deputy Solicitor General, which significantly contributed

towards the development of this judgment.
