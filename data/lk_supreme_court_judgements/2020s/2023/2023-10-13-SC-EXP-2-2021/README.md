Determination

Aluwihare PC, J

The Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this court in terms of Article 99(13)(a) of

the Constitution seeking declarations from this court that the expulsion of the

Petitioner from Ape Janabala Pakshaya, is invalid; that the seat he held in Parliament

has not become vacant consequent to such expulsion and that the Petitioner has not

ceased to be a member of Parliament.

The Petitioner was declared elected as a Member of Parliament under Article 99A of

the Constitution and the same was gazetted by the Commissioner General of Elections

under an order of the Election Commission on 18-12-2020.

The factual background

The Petitioner is the Chairman of the Wijaya Dharani National Council; a political

party but not a recognized political party under the provisions of the Parliamentary

Elections Act No. 1 of 1981, as amended. The Petitioner, therefore, had decided to

contest the general elections through the 1st Respondent which is a recognized

political party registered with the Election Commission. Accordingly, a Memorandum

of Understanding (hereinafter referred to as the MOU) was signed between the 1st

Respondent, Ape Janabala Pakshaya party and Wijaya Dharani National Council on

18.03.2020. This was to create a coalition or an alliance between the two political

parties and to facilitate Wijaya Dharani National Council to contest for the

Parliamentary Elections under the 1st Respondent, Ape Janabala Pakshaya. [P4]

In terms of the MOU entered between the Ape Janabala Pakshaya and the Wijaya

Dharani National Council, the parties had expressly agreed, inter alia, to the

following conditions;

a) Clause 5; the parties had very clearly agreed that the Ape Janabala

Pakshaya being the first party to the same, has no right to influence or

intervene or object to any political decisions and activities taken by the 2nd

5

party to the MOU, i.e., the Wijaya Dharani National Council of which the

Petitioner is a member as well as its chairman.

b) Clause 6;, the parties had agreed that the 1st Party Ape Janabala Pakshaya

will not have any influence on a member of parliament elected from the

2nd party Wijaya Dharani National Council in relation to any activity of

such member.

c) Clause 7; The members of the 2nd party [Wijaya Dharani National Council]

cannot be subjected to the rules and regulations of the 1st Party; Ape

Janabala Pakshaya, no disciplinary action or other influence can be brought

upon the members of the 2nd Party.

d) Clause 4, the parties also agreed to appoint a candidate nominated by the

Petitioner, as a member of Parliament as the 1st appointee from the National

List and in the event a 2nd member is to be nominated from the National list,

such nomination to be done by the 1st Party.

Further, the members of the Wijaya Dharani National Council were to remain

separate and distinct as opposed to de jure members of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya

and were not required to obtain the membership of the said Ape Janabala Pakshaya.

Pursuant to executing the MOU, each candidate of the Wijaya Dharani National

Council party including the Petitioner, thereafter signed and executed a Letter of

Promise, whereby the candidates agreed to abide by the terms and conditions

stipulated therein, pledging allegiance to the Wijaya Dharani National Council. The

Pledge further confirmed that the Disciplinary Committee of Wijaya Dharani

National Council had disciplinary control over its members.

6

At the conclusion of the Parliamentary Election on 05.08.2020, the Ape Janabala

Pakshaya was informed by the Election Commission that it had secured one National

List seat in Parliament, in terms of Article 99A of the Constitution.

The Petitioner, albeit, after a brief dispute among the coalition partners, was declared

elected as a Member of Parliament under the Constitution provision referred to, by

Gazette Notification dated 18.12.2020.

According to the Petitioner, he received a letter dated 30.06.2020 under the hand of

the 2nd Respondent, calling for explanation in relation to five issues enumerated

therein, on the basis that the Central Committee of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya had

decided to hold an inquiry, in view of the several complaints received by the Party

[P18]. Whilst calling upon the Petitioner to respond to the issues referred to in the

letter within seven days, it states that if the Petitioner is unable to provide acceptable

explanation to the issues raised in the letter, the Disciplinary Committee of the Ape

Janabala Pakshaya will take steps to issue a charge sheet against the Petitioner.

The Petitioner has taken strong objection to the said letter on the basis that he cannot

be subjected to any disciplinary control by the Ape Janabala Pakshaya since the

Constitution of the said Party has no application to the Petitioner as he is not a member

of the said political Party and the Constitution of the said Political Party mandates

taking disciplinary action against its members only. In any event, the MOU [P4]

categorically states that the disciplinary control of the members of Vijaya Dharani

National Council is not within the preview of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya.

The Petitioner has not replied the latter [P18] reasoning that, without any form of

prejudice to the position of the Petitioner, the provisions contained in the Constitution

of Ape Janabala Pakshaya have no application or authority as far as the Petitioner is

concerned.

7

The Petitioner was sent a second letter [by the 2nd Respondent] dated 05.08.2020

containing eight charges and informing the Petitioner that a disciplinary inquiry

relating the to the said charge sheet would be held on the 20th August 2020,requiring

the Petitioner to attend the same. Due to the spread of Covid 19 pandemic, however,

the Petitioner was informed that the said inquiry will not be held on 20.08.2021.

The Petitioner had then been sent a charge sheet again by a letter dated 01.10.2021

by the Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee of Ape Janabala Pakshaya containing

the same charges as the previous charge sheet dated 05.08.2021 and informing the

Petitioner that the inquiry into the charges will be held on 14.10.2021

The petitioner was also informed that in the event the Petitioner is found guilty for

one or more of the charges stipulated therein, the same will be communicated to the

Chairman of the party, the Political Board and Central Working Committee, for the

consideration of the expulsion of the Petitioner from Ape Janabala Pakshaya and in

the event of the Petitioner failing to attend the said disciplinary inquiry, the inquiry

will be conducted by the said Disciplinary Committee, ex parte.

The Petitioner contended that he was hospitalised on the 13.10.2021 and as such, he

instructed his Attorney, Dinesh Vidanapathirana to inform the Disciplinary

Committee of his medical condition and his incapacity to participate at the inquiry. It

is alleged that the Attorney concerned was prevented at the gate either to

communicate with any official or from informing the medical condition of the

Petitioner,This is affirmed by the Affidavit of Dinesh Vidanapathirana dated 11

.11.2021 [P22].

The 2nd Respondent, by his letter dated 15.10.2021, had communicated to the

Election Commission, the decision of the Central Committee of the Ape Janabala

Pakshaya to expel the Petitioner from the membership of the Party and had requested

the Election Commission to annul the parliamentary seat held by the Petitioner.

8

The Petitioner had also received a letter dated 15.10.2021 informing him of the

recommendation of the disciplinary committee and the purported decision of the

Central Working Committee and the Chairman of the party; Ape Janabala Pakshaya.

By letter dated 16.10.2021[P25], the 2nd Respondent had informed the Secretary

General of the Parliament that the Petitioner has been expelled from Ape Janabala

Pakshaya with effect from 14.10.2021 and consequently, the Parliament seat held by

the Petitioner had fallen vacant by virtue of Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution and

had requested the Secretary General to take necessary action in terms of Article

99(13) of the Constitution read with Section 64 of the Parliamentary Elections Act

No.1 of 1981.The Petitioner, by letter dated 08.11.2021 addressed to the 2nd

respondent, placed his position relating to the dispute and challenged the decision

taken by the disciplinary committee and the Central Working Committee of the party

including the Chairman of Ape Janabala Pakshaya.

The gravamen of the Petitioner is that he cannot be subjected to the disciplinary

control or authority of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya or its Central Working Committee

and as such the action taken against him is patently illegal and grievously unlawful

and is also violative of the rules of natural justice. It was on the above premise that

the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this court in terms of Article 99(13) (a) of

the Constitution.

Subsequent developments

After the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this court, which was on the 11th of

November 2021, the attorney on record for the 1st to the 3rd Respondent by way of a

motion dated 21st January 2022, informed the Court that steps had been taken to

withdraw the expulsion of the Petitioner and produced a copy of the letter signed by

the 2nd Respondent dated 12.01 2022, sent to the Petitioner and copied both to the

Secretary General of Parliament as well as the Chairman Election Commission [A].

The letter states that the decision taken by 'Ape Janabala Pakshaya on 14.10.2021 to

9

expel the petitioner will be revisited by the Central Committee and the Chairman of

the Party.

In response to the motion referred to above, the Petitioner by way of a motion dated

21st February 2022, brought to the attention of the Court that the withdrawal of the

decision to expel the petitioner is conditional and as such the Petitioner wishes to

pursue this application and invited this Court to make a final determination with

regard to the validity or otherwise of the impugned expulsion.

Sequel to the said motion by the Petitioner dated 21.02.2022 referred to above, the 1st

to the 3rd Respondent filing a further motion on 24th February 2022 informed court

that steps have been taken to withdraw the expulsion of the Petitioner and had

annexed a letter dated 14.02.2022 addressed to the Petitioner informing him that the

decision taken by the Central Committee and the Chairman of the Ape Janabala

Pakshaya 14.10.2021 to expel the Petitioner was rescinded [X]. The letter had been

copied to the Secretary General, Parliament and the Chairman, Elections Commission.

As opposed to the letter issued by the 2nd Respondent dated 12.01.2022 [A], the second

letter referred to above [X] is clearly an unconditional rescinding of the decision to

expel the Petitioner from the membership of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya.

Even in this backdrop, relying on the decision in the case of Ameer Ali and Others V.

Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and Others 2006 IV SLR 189, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner contended that notwithstanding the withdrawal of the

expulsion of the Petitioner, this Court has the jurisdiction to determine the validity of

the expulsion. The learned Presidents Counsel contended that the withdrawal of the

expulsion is conditional and restricted only to one of the grounds on which the

expulsions have been challenged before this court, namely the failure to comply with

the principles of natural justice, thus, this Court should hear and determine the matter

in its entirety.

10

The learned Counsel for the 1st to 3rd respondents, [the party, General Secretary and

Chairman respectively], however, submitted that, since the expulsion had been

withdrawn, it is unnecessary for this court to make any decision as to the validity of

the expulsion and that the proceedings should be accordingly terminated.

In terms of Article 99(13)(a) of the Constitution, where a Member of Parliament

ceases by expulsion to be a member of a recognized party on whose nomination paper,

his name appeared at the time of becoming such Member of Parliament, his seat

becomes vacant upon the expiration of a period of one month from the date of his

ceasing to be such member. The proviso to the Sub-article states that the seat will not

become vacant if prior to the expiration of one month the member applies to the

Supreme Court and this Court determines in such application that the expulsion was

invalid. It is to be noted that the withdrawal of the expulsion by the 2nd and 3rd

respondents on behalf of the 1st respondent was done on 14.02.2022, after a period

of one month had elapsed from the date of the impugned expulsion. Thus, the

withdrawal [of the expulsion] was done at a time when this Court was seized with the

matter and in terms of the proviso to the Constitutional provision referred to, the seat

will become vacant only if this Court makes a determination that the expulsion is

valid. Accordingly, the withdrawal by the respondents does not per se result in a

position where the expulsion becomes invalid and the Petitioner is correct in

requesting a determination to be made by the Court as to the validity of the expulsion.

The learned Presidents Counsel submitted that the initial letter [A] seeking to

withdraw the expulsions on the alleged non-compliance with the principles of

natural justice in arriving at a decision to expel the Petitioner should be taken as a

concession on the part of the 1st to 3rd Respondents of this ground of invalidity.

The sequence of events outlined above reveals that the patent failure to adhere to the

principles of natural justice in the purported decision to expel the Petitioner from the

party, without prejudice to the position held by the Petitioner that Petitioner is not

subject to the disciplinary control or authority of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya and/or

11

its Central Working Committee, the party Chairman or the Disciplinary Committee.

Furthermore, the Petitioner asserts that the conduct of these bodies including the

party itself is patently illegal and grievously unlawful and is also violative the

fundamental postulates of the rule of law, and also the basic rules of natural justice,

including the principle of Audi Alteram Partem, in as much as, it is very clear that the

said purported disciplinary committee of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya arrived at the

aforesaid recommendation/decision to expel the Petitioner from Ape Janabala

Pakshaya political party, without affording any form of hearing whatsoever to the

Petitioner and/or his legal representative.

In the case of Tilak Karunaratne vs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Others 1993 1 SLR

91, Dheeraratne J., having examined the nature of the jurisdiction conferred on this

Court in terms of the provisions of Article 99(13)(a) observed; [at page 101]-

The nature if the jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court in terms of the proviso

to Article 99(13)(a) is indeed unique in character; it calls for a determination that

expulsion of a member of Parliament from a recognized political party on whose

nomination paper his name appeared at the time of his becoming such Member of

Parliament, was valid or invalid. If the expulsion is determined to be valid, the seat of

the Member of Parliament becomes vacant. It is this seriousness of the consequence

of expulsion which has prompted the framers of the Constitution to invest that unique

original jurisdiction in the highest court of the island, so that a Member of Parliament

may be amply shielded from being expelled from his own party unlawfully and/or

capriciously. It is not disputed that this Courts jurisdiction includes, an investigation

into the requisite competence of the expelling authority, an investigation as to

whether the expelling authority followed the procedure, if any, which was mandatory

in nature; an investigation as to whether there was breach of principles of natural

justice in the decision-making process; and an investigation as to whether in the event

of grounds of expulsion being specified by way of charges at a domestic inquiry the

member was expelled on some other grounds which were not so specified ....

12

In the instant case, as referred to earlier Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the MOU[P4] entered

into between the Petitioners party; Wijaya Dharani National Council and the

political party of the Respondents, Ape Janabala Pakshaya clearly spells out that the

members of the Wijaya Dharani National Council including the Petitioner shall not

be subject to the rules and regulations of the Ape Janabala Pakshaya and such

members cannot be called upon for any disciplinary inquiry.

In the circumstances aforesaid, it was submitted that the office bearers of the Ape

Janabala Pakshaya cannot influence, intervene, or object to the political decisions

taken by the Ape Janabala Pakshaya nor is there any provision to subject the

Petitioner to disciplinary control of Ape Janabala Pakshaya. Thus, it would be of vital

importance to consider whether officials of Ape Janabala Pakshaya had a mandate

to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner in the first place. In this

regard Justice Marsoof in the case Perumpulli Hewage Piyasena, v. Ilankai Tamil

Arasu Kadchi [SC Application Special [Expulsion] No. 03/2010,SC minutes

8.02.2011] observed;

For this purpose, before considering the grounds set out in paragraph 29 of his

Petition dated 10th December 2010 for challenging his expulsion, it is necessary to

consider whether, in the first place, the Petitioner was amenable to the disciplinary

control of ITAK. This is a matter of fundamental importance which involves another

important question, namely, whether the Petitioner is or was a member of ITAK,

because it is obvious that only a member of a political party that can be dealt with by

that party for any breach of discipline.

In the case of Ameer Ali and Others vs. Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and Others, 2006,

1 SLR 189, Sarath N. Silva J [as he then was]., observed that this Court has to examine

the requisite competence of the expelling authority and the nature of the decision-

making process including that of the domestic inquiry to be satisfied as to its bona

fides and the compliance with the principles of natural justice.

13

In the circumstances, I hold that the decision to expel the petitioner from the

membership of Ape Janabala Pakshaya on a purported decision of the Disciplinary

Committee by the letter dated 15.10.2021 marked P23, is ex-facie illegal as it has

not been made by the appropriate disciplinary authority in terms of the MOU.

For all the aforesaid reasons, I determine that for the purposes of Article 99(13)(a) of

the Constitution, the purported expulsion of the Petitioner, Ven. Athuraliye Rathana

Thero was invalid.

In all the circumstances of the case, I make no order as to costs.

Expulsion determined invalid.
