"At  the  conclusion  of  the  Parliamentary  Election  on  05.08.2020,  the  ‘Ape  Janabala"
"Pakshaya’ was informed by the Election Commission that it had secured one National"
"List seat in Parliament, in terms of Article 99A of the Constitution."
"T
he Petitioner, albeit, after a brief dispute among the coalition partners, was declared"
"elected as a Member of Parliament under the Constitution provision referred to, by"
"Gazette Notification dated 18.12.2020."
"A
ccording to the Petitioner, he received a letter dated 30.06.2020 under the hand of"
"the  2nd  Respondent,  calling  for  explanation  in  relation  to  five  issues  enumerated"
"therein, on the basis that the Central Committee of the ‘Ape Janabala Pakshaya’ had"
"decided to hold an inquiry, in view of the several complaints received by the Party"
"[P18]. Whilst calling upon the Petitioner to respond to the ‘issues’ referred to in the"
"letter within seven days, it states that if the Petitioner is unable to provide acceptable"
"explanation to the issues raised in the letter, the Disciplinary Committee of the ‘Ape"
"Janabala Pakshaya’ will take steps to issue a charge sheet’ against the Petitioner."
"T
he Petitioner has taken strong objection to the said letter on the basis that he cannot"
"be  subjected  to  any  disciplinary  control  by  the  ‘Ape  Janabala  Pakshaya’  since  the"
"Constitution of the said Party has no application to the Petitioner as he is not a member"
"of  the  said  political  Party  and  the  Constitution  of  the  said  Political  Party  mandates"
"taking  disciplinary  action  against  its  members  only.  In  any  event,  the  MOU  [P4]"
"categorically states that the disciplinary control of the members of ‘Vijaya  Dharani"
"National Council’ is not within the preview of the ’Ape Janabala Pakshaya’."
"T
he  Petitioner  has  not  replied  the  latter  [P18]  reasoning  that, without  any  form  of"
"prejudice to the position of the Petitioner, the provisions contained in the Constitution"
"of ‘Ape Janabala Pakshaya’ have no application or authority as far as the Petitioner is"
"concerned."
