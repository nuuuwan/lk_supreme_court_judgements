ARGUED ON : 07th March, 2022 ORDER ON : 10th March, 2023 ********* ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Complainant-Respondent-Appellant (hereinafter referred to

as the Appellant), sought special leave to appeal from this Court over

several questions of law arising out of a Judgment pronounced by the

Court of Appeal on 02.02.2012 in relation to the criminal appeal No. CA

97/2004.

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

3

Perusal of the proceedings before the appellate Court indicate

that one Dekum Ambakotuwa Prageeth Nishantha Bandara was indicted by

the Hon. Attorney General on 19.10.1997, alleging that he committed

rape, an offence punishable under Section 364(2) of the Penal Code, as

amended by Act No. 22 of 1995. The trial against said Dekum

Ambakotuwa Prageeth Nishantha Bandara proceeded before a Judge

without a Jury and, at the conclusion of which, the Court found him

guilty as charged. The High Court thereupon imposed a 10-year term of

imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5000.00 on him, coupled with a default

sentence. In addition, he was to compensate the victim with a payment

of Rs. 15,000.00. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence,

said Dekum Ambakotuwa Prageeth Nishantha Bandara had preferred an

appeal to the Court of Appeal under CA Appeal No. 97/2004. In the

caption to his petition of appeal, he had described himself as the

Accused-Appellant. The Court of Appeal, by its Judgment dated

26.10.2004, pronounced after hearing of the said appeal, had set aside

the conviction entered against the Accused-Appellant by the Kalutara

High Court in case No. 38/2000 HC, along with the sentences of

imprisonment and compensation. It is against the said Judgment of the

Court of Appeal that the Appellant had sought special leave to appeal

from this Court.

However, in the operative part of the caption to the said

application, i.e., the part demarcated by the section titled AND NOW

BETWEEN, which indicates the names of the parties to the application

before this Court, the Appellant had named one Imbulana Liyanage

Dharmawardhana of No. 145/53, Walaw-watta, Weliweriya, (hereinafter

referred to as the original Respondent) as the Accused-Appellant-

Respondent and not the actual Accused-Appellant before the Court of

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

4

Appeal, namely Dekum Ambakotuwa Prageeth Nishantha Bandara of

Godella Watta, Andawela, Meegama, (hereinafter referred to as the present

Respondent) in whose favour the impugned Judgment of the Court of

Appeal was pronounced.

Application of the Appellant listed to be supported on 28.05.2012

and notice on the said original Respondent was dispatched by the

Registry on 21.03.2012. When the application was taken up on

28.05.2012 for support, the original Respondent was absent and

unrepresented. Thereupon, Court made order that the matter is re-fixed

for support once again on 05.07.2012, with notice to the Respondent. The

notice issued on the original Respondent was returned to the Registry

on 31.05.2012 with the endorsement that its intended recipient had

rejected the notice. This fact was brought to the notice of the Appellant

on 11.06.2012 by the Registry. Consequent to the said intimation, a

motion was tendered to Court by the Appellant on 25.06.2012. The

Appellant thereby sought to amend the caption by substituting the name

and address of the Accused-Appellant-Respondent but did not indicate as

to the status of the already named Imbulana Liyanage Dharmawardhana of

No. 145/53, Walaw-watta, Weliweriya upon the said substitution. This

motion was supported by the Appellant on 05.07.2012 and the Court

allowed his application to amend the caption.

Consequent to the said order of Court, the Appellant had, in

order to reflect the present Respondent, Dekum Ambakotuwa Prageeth

Nishantha Bandara of Godella Watta, Andawela, Meegama is named as the

Accused-Appellant-Respondent, tendered an amended caption. Only

then the present Respondent was noticed to appear before Court on

11.09.2012, being the next date of support. Notice of the said application

was dispatched on the present Respondent only on 31.07.2012, who had

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

5

then tendered his proxy and caveat along with a motion dated

08.08.2012.

When the application of the Appellant for special leave to appeal

was eventually supported before this Court on 07.12.2012, learned

Presidents Counsel, who represented the present Respondent, moved

Court to consider the question whether the application of the Appellant

is time-barred inasmuch as a wrong party had been originally named

and the present Respondent was brought in as a party to that

application by substituting his name at a subsequent stage and that too

after a period of over ten months. This Court, however, after hearing

parties granted special leave to appeal to several questions of law, as set

out in sub paragraphs (a) to (d) of paragraph 14 of the petition of the

Appellant dated 14.03.2012 and the appeal was fixed for hearing.

When the instant appeal was taken up for hearing on 07.03.2022,

learned Presidents Counsel for the present Respondent reagitated his

contention already presented before this Court on 07.12.2012 and raised

it formally as a preliminary objection. It was also his contention that the

rules of procedure that had been laid down in the Supreme Court Rules

of 1990, which sets out the manner in which a party could invoke the

final appellate jurisdiction of this Court, are mandatory in nature and

therefore, in view of the failure of the Appellant to comply with same,

his appeal should be rejected in limine.

Since the objection of the present Respondent concerns a

threshold issue as to the proper invocation of jurisdiction, the Court

decided to hear parties on the said preliminary objection.

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

6

The preliminary objection raised by the present Respondent, in

the manner in which the Appellant had invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court, is founded upon his alleged failure to adhere to a procedural

requirement, which he contends as mandatory in nature. In support of

his objection, learned Presidents Counsel had strongly relied on the

applicable rules of procedure contained in the Rules of the Supreme

Court 1990, which specifically lay down the manner of lodging

applications seeking special leave to appeal from a Judgment of the

Court of Appeal. In the circumstances, it is very relevant to consider at

the very outset of the applicable procedural requirements which must

be fulfilled by an applicant, in seeking special leave to appeal, as laid

down by the Supreme Court Rules 1990, along with the judicial

precedents which had indicated the degree of importance this Court

had attached to adherence to these procedural requirements and the

consequences that may follow upon non-compliance of these Rules.

Article 118(c) of the Constitution states that subject to the

provisions of the Constitution, the Supreme Court shall exercise final

appellate jurisdiction. Article 127(1) and 127(2) defines the scope of the

said jurisdiction conferred on this Court while Article 128(1) provides

that an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any final order,

Judgment, decree or sentence of the Court of Appeal, whether civil or

criminal, which involves a substantial question of law, if the Court of

Appeal granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. Article 128(2)

states that the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave

to appeal from any final or interlocutory order, Judgment, decree or

sentence of the Court of Appeal, whether civil or criminal. Special leave

to appeal could also be granted by this Court, where the Court of

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

7

Appeal has refused to grant leave to appeal or in the instances where

this Court is of the opinion that the case or matter is fit for review.

The boundaries within which the right to invoke an appellate

jurisdiction were considered in Martin v Wijewardena (1989) 2 Sri L.R.

409, where this Court held (at p. 419) that an Appeal is a Statutory Right

and must be expressly created and granted by Statute. It cannot be implied

and therefore the right to avail of or take advantage of that jurisdiction is

governed by the several statutory provisions in various Legislative

Enactments. That is to say, for appeals from the regular Courts, in the

Judicature Act, and the Procedural Laws pertaining to those Courts. Hence,

the preliminary objection of the present Respondent, founded on the

premise of non-compliance of a mandatory procedural requirement.

In the Judgment of Nestle Lanka PLC v Gamini Rajapakshe (SC

Appeal No. SC HC LA/54/18 decided on 30.09.2020) Jayasuriya CJ,

having observed that the Constitution that establishes the Supreme

Court and makes provision relating to its jurisdiction have not made provisions

relating to the practice and procedure of the Court and had left it to the

Supreme Court to make provision on such matters by way of Rules under

Article 136 subject to the provisions of the Constitution and any law. His

Lordship further observed that the Constitution empowers to make

such Rules regulating the practice and procedure including matters pertaining

to appeals such as the terms under which appeals to the Supreme Court to be

entertained and for provision for the dismissal of such appeals for non-

compliance with such Rules. In this context, it is pertinent to refer to

another observation on the same lines, made by Bandaranayake CJ, in the

Judgment of Sudath Rohana and Another v Mohamed Zeena and

Another (2011) 2 Sri L.R. 134 (at p. 144) where it is stated that whilst the

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

8

substantive law lays down the rights, duties, powers and liberties; the

procedural law refers to the enforcement of such rights and duties. In other

words, the procedural law breathes life into substantive law, sets it in motion,

and functions side by side with the substantive law.

Thereupon, her Ladyship added that the Rules of the Supreme

Court are made in terms of Article 136 of the Constitution, to regulate the

practice and procedure of this Court. Similar to the Civil Procedure Code,

which is the principal source of procedure which guides the Courts of civil

jurisdiction, the Supreme Court Rules thus regulates the practice and

procedure of the Supreme Court.

Turning to the question at hand; it is to be noted that the caption

to the application of the Appellant describes its nature as an application

for special leave to appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal, in

terms of Article 128 of the Constitution. Since the Appellant had sought

special leave to appeal from this Court over a final Judgment of the

Court of Appeal, it is clear that, in doing so, he had moved this Court

by invoking its jurisdiction conferred under Article 128(2).

Learned Presidents Counsel strongly contended that for all

purposes the application by which the Appellant sought special leave to

appeal against the present Respondent was made only on 07.12.2012

and that too with the insertion of his name and thereby substituting him

in the place of the original Respondent, whereas the impugned

Judgment of the Court of Appeal had been delivered in favour of the

present Respondent on 02.02.2012. Since the Appellant had moved this

Court seeking special leave to appeal against the said Judgment after a

period of well over ten months, the Appellant had acted in violation of

the specific time period, as laid down by Rule 7, which restricted the

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

9

time within which such an application should be made to six weeks

reckoned from the date of the order, Judgment decree or sentence of the

Court of Appeal. Therefore, the present Respondent contended that the

appeal of the Appellant is clearly time barred and should be rejected.

There is no dispute to the factual position of naming the present

Respondent was made, as the sole respondent in the special leave to

appeal application of the Appellant, only after the applicable six-weeks

time period reckoned from the date of the Judgment of the Court of

Appeal had lapsed. The Appellant, by a motion dated 25.06.2012,

moved this Court to amend the caption by substituting the name and

address of the Accused-Appellant-Respondent as Dekum Ambakotuwa

Prageeth Nishantha Bandara, Godella Watta, Andawela, Meegama for the

name and address Imbulana Liyanage Dharmawardana, No. 145/53,

Walawvatta, Weliweriya in the caption thereof. This motion was supported

by a Deputy Solicitor General on 05.07.2012 and, in the absence of the

present Respondent, this Court allowed the amendment of the caption

and made order to notify the present Respondent.

Thus, the present Respondent was named as a respondent to the

application of the Appellant only on the 05.07.2012 and that too was

made without serving notice on him. The Judgment of the Court of

Appeal, against which the application to seek special leave to appeal

was lodged, was pronounced on 02.02.2012. Obviously, the time

interval between these two points well exceeds the six-weeks limitation

as per Rule 7.

Defending his motion to substitute the present Respondent, in

place of the original respondent, the Appellant had contended that the

application for special leave to appeal against the impugned Judgment

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

10

of the Court of Appeal had in fact been lodged within the stipulated

time period as prescribed by Rule 7 and therefore the jurisdiction of this

Court had properly been invoked as far as this appeal is concerned.

In view of the conflicting positions presented by the learned

Counsel as to the validity of the application, the pivotal question that

should be decided by this Court in respect of the preliminary objection

raised on behalf of the Respondent could be identified as whether, in

terms of the Supreme Court Rules 1990, the Appellant could validly

invoke the final appellate jurisdiction of this Court by substituting the

present Respondent, after the expiration of the time period of six weeks

reckoned from the date of the pronouncement of the Judgment of the

Court of Appeal, to an application that had already been lodged within

time but naming a wrong party?

In this regard, I must therefore consider the procedure that had

been laid down in the said Rules, in setting out the manner in which a

party could make an application for special leave to appeal against a

Judgment or an order of the Court of Appeal and thereby properly

invoke the final appellate jurisdiction of this Court.

Sub part A of Part I of the Supreme Court Rules 1990, which

consists of a total number of 17 Rules (from Rule 2 to 18), sets out the

procedure an applicant must follow and should comply with, when

making an application for special leave to appeal. Rules 2 and 3 deals

primarily with the content and the format of such an application should

be drafted and presented with and, in addition, also impose the

requirements of setting out the questions of law on which special leave

to appeal is sought. The Rules further require such an applicant to set

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

11

out in that application as to the circumstances which renders the case or

matter fit for review by the Supreme Court.

The provisions that are directly applicable to find an answer to

the question referred to in the preceding segment could be found in

Rule 4. Hence, for the convenience of treatment, it is important to

reproduce the said Rule below in its original form;

Rule 4, in reference to an application under Rule 2, states as

follows;

In every such application, there shall be named as respondent,

the party or parties (whether complainant or accused, in a

criminal cause or matter, or whether the plaintiff, petitioner,

defendant, respondent, intervenient or otherwise, in a civil cause

or matter) in whose favour the judgment or order complaint

against was delivered, or adversely to who whom such

application is preferred, or whose interest may be adversely

affected by the success of the appeal, and the names and the

present addresses of all such respondents shall be set out in full.

The instant matter before this Court, the impugned Judgment is a

final Judgment of the Court of Appeal, which determined an appeal

preferred to that Court upon a conviction entered against the present

Respondent following a criminal prosecution conducted before a High

Court. In the circumstances, I once again reproduce the said Rule 4

below, but after leaving out the irrelevant parts. Thus, the edited-out

Rule 4 now reads thus;

In every such application, there shall be named as respondent,

i. the accused in whose favour the judgment complaint against was

delivered, or

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

12

ii. adversely to who whom such application is preferred, or

iii. whose interest may be adversely affected by the success of the

appeal,

and the names and the present addresses of all such respondents shall be

set out in full.

The indictment presented before the High Court of Kalutara

contained only one name as the person against whom the accusation of

rape was made and it is the name of the present Respondent that

appears therein as the accused. The caption to the petition of appeal

that had been preferred to the Court of Appeal by the present

Respondent after his conviction described him as the only Accused-

Appellant named therein. The present Respondent succeeded in his

appeal. In these circumstances, the present Respondent should have

been named as the Accused-Appellant-Respondent at the time of

lodgment of the application seeking special leave to appeal. This is

because only he is qualified to be treated as either the accused in whose

favour the Judgment complaint against was delivered or whose interest may

be adversely affected by the success of the appeal. The original Respondent,

who had been named by the Appellant would only fit into the category

of a person adversely to who whom such application is preferred.

Obviously, the original Respondent had nothing to do with the

application of the Appellant seeking special leave to appeal against a

Judgment of the Court of Appeal to which he is not a party and perhaps

that could be the reason as to why he had refused to accept the notice

sent by the Registry of this Court. The identity of the present

Respondent is already known to the Appellant as the indictment and

the petition of appeal of the present Respondent clearly indicate the

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

13

names of the relevant parties to the prosecution as well as to the appeal

preferred to the Court of Appeal.

But what is important to note here is when the Appellant had

only named a person adversely to who whom such application is preferred,

and thereby leaving out the accused in whose favour the Judgment

complaint against was delivered and whose interest may be adversely

affected by the success of the appeal, whether this Court could accept the

contention of the Appellant that he had complied with the procedure as

set out in Rule.

In view of the nature of the preliminary objection, the only way

the Appellant could negate the contention of the present Respondent is

that he must satisfy this Court there was a valid application pending

before this Court to which the present Respondent was subsequently

named as the Accused-Appellant-Respondent.

If the Appellant had named either the accused in whose favour the

Judgment complaint against was delivered or whose interest may be

adversely affected by the success of the appeal, at the time of the lodgement

of his application that would automatically satisfy the requirement of

naming the person adversely to who whom such application is preferred.

But the Appellant did not name either the accused in whose favour the

Judgment complaint against was delivered or the person whose interest

may be adversely affected by the success of the appeal. Instead only the

person adversely to who whom such application is preferred was named as

the Accused- Appellant-Respondent. In such an instance, the course of

action adopted by the Appellant would lead to the question, whether

there was a valid application for special leave to appeal for the

Appellant to substitute the present Respondent with.

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

14

The requirement of correctly identifying and naming the parties

in an application invoking appellate jurisdiction of this Court was

raised before this Court and considered in the appeal of Ibrahim v

Nadarajah (1991) 1 Sri L.R. 131. This was an instance where the

appellant had failed to name a particular party to the proceedings

before the original Court as a respondent in the appellate proceedings

before this Court, despite naming several others. Court had then

considered the question whether there was non-compliance of Rule 4

and 28(5) and if so, the consequences that would follow upon such non-

compliance. Delivering the Judgment of Court, Amarasinghe J stated that

the consideration of Rule 28(5) in relation to Rule 4 was necessary due

to the reason that although ordinarily in terms of Rule 27 all appeals to the

Supreme Court must be upon a petition in that behalf lodged by the appellant,

where leave to appeal is granted, Rule 12 makes it unnecessary for the

appellant to file a fresh petition of appeal. The application for leave to appeal is

deemed to be the petition of appeal. A petition of appeal, whether actual or

deemed, however, must in terms of Rule 28 name as respondents all parties in

whose favour the judgment appealed against has been delivered and all parties

whose interests may be adversely affected by the success of the appeal together

with their full addresses.

His Lordship then determined the consequences of such a failure

would follow by holding that It has always, therefore, been the law that it

is necessary for the proper constitution of an appeal that all parties who may be

adversely affected by the result of the appeal should be made parties and, unless

they are, the petition of appeal should be rejected.

The principle of law enunciated by the said pronouncement of

Amerasinghe J was re-affirmed in Senanayake v Attorney General &

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

15

Another (2010) 1 Sri L.R. 149, as it was stated by Bandaranayake J (as she

then was) that In terms of the Supreme Court Rules, for the purpose of

proper constitution of an appeal, it is vital that all parties, who may be

adversely affected by the result of the appeal should be made parties. In

stating thus, this Court had considered the preliminary objection of the

learned Senior State Counsel, who contended that since the Director-

General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption, a necessary party to that application, had not been named a

respondent, the appellant had not complied with Rules 4 and 28 of the

Supreme Court Rules 1990. On that premise, he moved for the dismissal

of the said appeal in limine. Having referred to Rules 4, 28(1) and 28(5),

her Ladyship held that The totality of the aforementioned Rules indicates

the necessity for all parties, who may be adversely affected by the success or

failure of the appeal to be made parties to the appeal. This Court thereupon

proceeded to dismiss the appeal for non-compliance of the Supreme

Court Rules.

In view of the above, it is clear that this Court had consistently

held that naming all parties who may be adversely affected by the result of

the appeal should be made parties as a mandatory requirement that an

applicant must comply in seeking special leave to appeal against a

Judgement or an order of the Court of Appeal and also for proper

invocation of its appellate jurisdiction. In the circumstances, such an

applicant must, in addition to naming all parties, who may be

adversely affected by the result of the appeal must also name the parties

adversely to who whom such application is preferred if the circumstances

so demand.

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

16

In addition to laying emphasis on the aspect of naming the

proper parties who may be adversely affected by the success of appeal

in view of the applicable rules of procedure, there is yet another aspect

that had been emphasised by this Court, which needs to be referred to

in this context. In the Judgment of The Ceylon Electricity Board & 9

others V. Ranjith Fonseka (2008) 1 SLR 337 this Court dealt with a

situation where the petitioner, in filing a Special Leave to Appeal

Application in the Supreme Court regarding an Order made by the

Court of Appeal, included an incorrect title and a statement in the

caption where the jurisdiction of this Court was pleaded incorrectly.

In pronouncing the Judgment, this Court was of the view that

the application for Special leave to Appeal filed by the Petitioners before the

apex Court of the Republic, should have been drafted with care and due

diligence in order to maintain the stature and dignity of this Court. An

application such as the present application, which is teeming with irregularities

and mistakes cannot, not only be tolerated, but also would be difficult to

maintain as each irregularity stated above is fatal to the acceptability and

maintainability of the application. Even if the objections may be technical in

nature, such irregularities clearly demonstrate the fact that the application

made by the petitioners has not complied with the Supreme Court Rules of

1990.

This particular aspect had become relevant in relation to the

instant appeal as well. Perusal of the caption to the application seeking

special leave to appeal lodged by the Appellant reveals that the name of

the present Respondent is already mentioned in the part of the caption

which describes the parties to the proceedings before the High Court

and also before the Court of Appeal. However, in the operative part of

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

17

the caption in which the parties to the proceedings before this Court are

named, the Appellant had inserted the name of the original

Respondent, instead of the present Respondent, who would

undoubtedly be adversely affected by the success of the appeal.

In view of the pronouncements of this Court quoted above, there

arises the question as to why this Court insisted on strict compliance of

Rule as a mandatory requirement and therefore held its non-compliance

is fatal to the maintenance of an application seeking special leave to

appeal. The answer to this question could be found in Ibrahim v

Nadarajah (supra) as it had been held that (at p.133) a failure to

comply with the requirements of Rules 4 and 28 of the Supreme Court is

necessarily fatal. Those Rules are meant to ensure that all parties who may be

prejudicially affected by the result of an appeal should be made parties. How

else could justice between the parties be ensured? It has always, therefore, been

the law that it is necessary for the proper constitution of an appeal that all

parties who may be adversely affected by the result of the appeal should be made

parties and, unless they are, the petition of appeal should be rejected. The

Court arrived at the said conclusion after considering the principles of

law that had been laid down and followed in the Judgments of Ibrahim

v. Beebee et al (1916) 19 NLR 289, Ammal et al v. Mohideen et al (1933)

34 NLR 442, Wickremasooriya v. Rajalias de Silva (1937) 8 CLW 29,

Seelananda v. Rajapakse (1938) 11 CLW 36, Sinnan Chettiar and

Others v. Mohideen and Swarishamy v. Thelenis et al (1916) 19 NLR

289.

It was also decided in Ibrahim v Nadarajah (supra, at p. 132) that

the mere act of granting leave by this Court, as in the case of the instant

appeal, would not confer any validity to a defective application for the

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

18

reason that granting of leave would only determines the question of

access to Court and it does not confer any advantages or exemptions on

the appellant other than to make it unnecessary for the appellant to file

a fresh petition of appeal.

It is already noted that by the motion dated 25.06.2012, the

Appellant moved Court to amend the caption by substituting the name and

address of the Accused-Appellant-Respondent as Dekum Ambakotuwa

Prageeth Nishantha Bandara, Godella Watta, Andawela, Meegama for the

name and address Imbulana Liyanage Dharmawardana, No. 145/53,

Walawvatta, Weliweriya in the caption thereof. The purpose of the motion,

according to the Appellant, is to substitute the name of the original

Respondent by the present Respondents, cited in the operative part of

the caption to the said application.

In these circumstances, it is pertinent at this juncture to consider

to the question whether such a step is even provided for in the Supreme

Court Rules 1990.

Rule 38 of Part II of the Supreme Court Rules, which lay down

general provisions regarding appeals and applications, indicate the

circumstances under which the Court would allow a substitution of a

party already named in an application or an appeal. The Rule 38 states

that where at any time after lodging of an application for special lave to

appeal the record becomes defective by reason of death or change of status

of a party to the proceedings this Court may make order substituting or

adding a person who appears to the Court to be the proper person upon

consideration of the material to establish that fact. Hence, the word

substitute, irrespective of the purpose in which it was used in the said

motion of the Appellant, should only be considered in the context of the

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

19

scope, as envisaged in Rule 38. Therefore, the proposed substitution of

one respondent in the place and room of another created by the act of

mere deletion of his name from the amended caption and making the

insertion of the name of another cannot be considered as a situation

where the record had become defective owing to the reason of the death

of a party or to a change of status of a party to the proceedings as

provided for in Rule 38. In view of the above considerations, it is my

view that, in terms of Rule 38 there cannot be a substitution of a party

who had wrongly been named at the time of lodgement of the

application seeking special leave to appeal with the insertion of the

name of the correct party at a subsequent stage. If that error is detected

within the stipulated time period of six weeks, during which an

applicant could lodge an application seeking special leave to appeal,

such an applicant could lodge a fresh application naming the correct

party.

An application for special leave to appeal, after its lodgement,

could not be corrected subsequently to cure any defects in naming of

parties, perhaps except to any obvious typographical errors. This is

because, unlike in section 332 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979 as amended, Rules of the Supreme Court does not

contain any similar provisions that provide for making such

amendments to an application for special leave to appeal after its

lodgement, in order to facilitate an applicant to rectify a defect in

naming parties by moving to substitute the correct party later. If an

applicant had named a wrong party at the time of lodgement of his

application, instead of a party who is adversely affected if the appeal

succeeds, that party could not thereafter be substituted to that

application at a later point of time and thereby enabling such an

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

20

applicant to bring his application in conformity with the procedure of

invoking the final appellate jurisdiction of this Court under Article

128(2), as laid down in Rules 1 to 7.

Section 332 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act specifically

provide for an amendment of an appeal after its lodgement on the basis

that is not in conformity with the manner prescribed therein,

particularly by section 331 of that Code. The section 332 had

empowered the original Court either to return the petition of appeal to

the appellant to make the necessary amendment or to permit such

amendment to be made then and there in satisfying the provisions of

section 331. The failure of an appellant to comply with a direction of

Court on such an amendment that should be made under section 332,

would make such a petition liable to be rejected by that Court. In

relation to civil litigation, Civil Procedure Code too, in section 759 also,

provide for amendment of the petition of appeal that had already been

lodged.

However, no comparable provision could be found in the

Supreme Court Rules to these statutory provisions contained in section

332 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code and section 759 of the Civil

Procedure Code. In fact, said Rules indicate a contrary provision to

sections 332 and 759. Rule 10(1) provided several reasons enabling a

single Judge of this Court, sitting in chambers, to refuse to entertain an

application for special leave to appeal. One such reason is if such

application does not comply with these rules. Thus, the defect of the

application of the Appellant owing to the failure to name the party

adversely affected if the appeal succeeds to the application at the time

of its lodgement cannot subsequently be cured merely by substituting

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

21

that party after the mandatory six weeks period had elapsed. If there

was compliance of Rule 8(4) by the Appellant, that initial defect in the

application could have been easily detected for that particular Rule

expected an applicant to attend the registry in the third week since the

lodgement of the application for special leave to appeal and to verify

whether the notices of the respondents were returned undelivered. If

this was done by the Appellant, there would have been a window of

opportunity to rectify the defect in the application, provided the

remedial action is taken within the stipulated six-weeks period, as

provided for by Rule 7.

This is not a situation where the often-quoted reasoning of

Fernando J in Kiriwantha and Another v Navaratne and Another (1990)

2 Sri L.R. 393 could be applied. In that instance his Lordship had

considered the nature of the consequences that would follow upon the

failure to comply with Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules 1978. Setting

aside the order of the Court of Appeal, in which such a failure had been

considered as a ground for an automatic rejection, his Lordship

preferred to adopt a a more liberal view as in the Judgment of Rasheed

Ali v Mohammed Ali (1981) 1 Sri L.R. 262 and stated that the Court

should first have determined whether the default had been satisfactorily

explained, or cured subsequently without unreasonable delay, and then have

exercised a judicial discretion either to excuse the non-compliance, or to impose

a sanction ; dismissal was not the only sanction. That discretion should have

been exercised primarily by reference to the purpose of the Rules, and not as a

means of punishing the defaulter. In arriving at this conclusion, his

Lordship cited and relied on the following quotation from Maxwell

(Interpretation of Statutes, 12th ed. pp. 314-5);

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

22

"When a statute requires that something shall be done, or

done in a particular manner or form, without expressly

declaring what shall be the consequence of non-

compliance, is the requirement to be regarded as

imperative (or mandatory) or merely as directory (or

permissive)? In some cases, the conditions or forms

prescribed by the statute have been regarded as essential

to the act or thing regulated by it, and their omission has

been held fatal to its validity. In others, such prescriptions

have been considered as merely directory, the neglect of

them involving nothing more than liability to a penalty, if

any were imposed, for breach of the enactment. 'An

absolute enactment must be obeyed or fulfilled exactly,

but it is sufficient if a directory enactment be obeyed or

fulfilled substantially.

Unlike the Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules 1978, Rule 10(1) of

the Supreme Court Rules 1990, in fact had spelt out the consequences

that would follow upon any failure to comply with the procedure that

had been laid down for moving this Court seeking special leave to

appeal, as set out in the Rules 1 to 7. That particular Rule made specific

provision that such an application is liable to be refused or to be

entertained.

In this context, it must be noted that this Court only allowed the

Appellant to amend the caption on 05.07.2012, and clearly desisted itself

in making a positive order of substitution, despite the motion requesting

the Court to do so and thereby to accept the proposed substitution of

the present Respondent as a party whose interest may be adversely

affected by the success of the appeal. The Appellant only deleted the

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

23

name of the original respondent from the amended caption and

replaced him with the insertion of the present Respondents name,

under the nomenclature Accused-Appellant-Respondent. The

amended caption that was filed by the Appellant had no indication to

the substitution of original Respondent, who was named and

described in the original caption as the Accused-Appellant-Respondent,

with the name of the present Respondent. The Court, at any point of

time, neither made any order either discharging the original Respondent

from these proceedings nor made order to substitute the present

Respondent in the formers place, as already noted. However, with the

replacement of the name of the present Respondent as the Accused-

Appellant-Respondent, the original Respondent had totally disappeared

from the caption. The amendment made to the caption by the Appellant

replacing the already named original respondent with the present

Respondent, after a period of six weeks from the pronouncement of the

final Judgment, cannot cure the fundamental defect created by the

failure to name the proper party at the time of Judgment of that

application for special leave to appeal against the Judgment of the Court

of Appeal in Appeal No. 97/2004.

In view of the above considerations, the appeal of the Appellant

should firstly be rejected due the failure of the Appellant to name the

present Respondent a party at the time of the lodgement of the instant

application, as it was imperative on the Appellant to name him due to

the reason that only he is qualified to be considered as the accused in

whose favour the Judgment complaint against was delivered or whose

interest may be adversely affected by the success of the appeal and not the

original Respondent. Secondly, the appeal of the Appellant should be

rejected for the reason that he cannot confer validity to a defective

S.C. Appeal No. 220/2012

24

application by tacking on to the same with naming of the present

Respondent and that too after the expiration of the mandatory period of

six weeks.

The appeal of the Appellant is accordingly rejected. Parties will

bear their costs.
