"45.  The  learned  Presidentâ€™s  Counsel  for  the  appellant  took  the"
"position  that,  the  learned  Judges  of  the  High  Court  have"
"erred in holding that the mere enjoyment of the right of way"
"for  the  period  of  prescription  is  proof  of  adverse  user  with"
"regard to a servitude based on prescription. It was asserted"
"that, the learned Judges of the High Court in relying on the"
"case of Mercin v. Edwin and Others [1984] 1 Sri.L.R. 224"
"which  in  turn  relied  on  the  South  African  case  of  Head  v."
"Toit S.A.L.R 1932 C.P.D. 287 have decided the instant case"
"based on principles of Roman Dutch Law. However,  it was"
"the position of the learned Counsel for the respondents that,"
"the learned Judges of the High Court have not erred in law"
"in  considering  Mercin(supra)  as  it  was  decided  after  the"
"enactment of the Prescription Ordinance."
