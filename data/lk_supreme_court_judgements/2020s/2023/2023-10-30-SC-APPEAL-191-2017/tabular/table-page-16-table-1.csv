case,

that
the
court would
order"
"reinstatement
in an application dismissed for want of appearance only if
the"
"defaulting party
furnished the
court with a ‘comprehensive and satisfactory"
"disclosure of all attendant circumstances’."
"In the present case,
the attendant circumstances are not satisfactory as such"
"do
not
elucidate
any
reasonable

sensible
explanation
that
justify
the"
"absence of
the Appellant’s attorney at
the High Court on the said date.
If
this"
"court
is to allow this sort of irresponsible behavior of an attorney,
it will
lead to"
"the erosion of professionalism in this noble profession. Even though it
is very"
"unfortunate in the present case that
the Appellant has to suffer for the fault of"

this one party’s grievances must be overridden by the necessity"

opinion that

judge has correctly exercised his discretion in dismissing"

application by

the

"the High Court appeal
is in compliance with the provisions of Section 769 of"
"the Civil Procedure Code in view of the non-appearance of the Petitioners before"
"court. As I have already discussed,
the court has wide discretion in relation to"
"the dismissal of cases. However,
if
the court
is to dismiss a case without giving"
"a hearing, such has to be done only when the justice so requires and justice so"
"requires in the present case."
