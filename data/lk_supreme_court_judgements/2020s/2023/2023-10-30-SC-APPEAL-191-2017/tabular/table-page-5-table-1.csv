"K.KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J."
"This is an appeal
from an order of
the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal of"
"the Uva Province holden in Badulla dated 24.02.2016 which dismissed the"
"application
made
by
the
Appellants
to
re-list
the
Appeal
bearing
No."
"UVA/HCCA/BDL/ 01/13/F, after
the said appeal was dismissed by the same"
"court
on
09.10.2013
for
want
of
appearance
of
the
Appellant,
or
their"
"Attorney-at-Law."
"The
Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent
(hereinafter
referred
to
as"
"the “Respondent”)
instituted the initial action in the District Court of Badulla"
"against
the
1st
and
2nd
Defendants-Appellants-Petitioners-Appellants"
"(hereinafter
referred
to
as
the
“Appellants”)
and
the
3rd"
"Defendant-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent seeking to recover a sum of Rs."
"7,126,338.17 and interest
thereon. The Respondent stated that
the said sum"
"was owed by way of
temporary overdrafts granted to one M.H.B Company of"
"which
Appellants
were
partners.
The
Appellant
together
with
the
3rd"
"Defendant-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent
sought
the
dismissal
of
the"
"Respondent’s action and contended that
there was a case filed earlier by them"
"before Commercial High Court bearing No. L/C/Civil/268/09/MR seeking to"
"recover damages against the Respondent."
"When the case was taken up for trial
in the District Court, the Appellant raised"
"a preliminary objection that
the District Court of Badulla has no jurisdiction to"
"hear
the
case, and the
case
should be
transferred to the Commercial High"
"Court of Colombo having regard to the value of the claim. The said preliminary"
"objection was overruled by the District Court by an order dated 31.05.2012"
"stating that
the Appellant has accepted the jurisdiction of
the District Court in"
"their answer and any objection on such should have been raised at that stage."
"The Learned District Court Judge also refused two more applications made by"
"the Appellants
to postpone
the
trial pending a Leave
to Appeal application"
