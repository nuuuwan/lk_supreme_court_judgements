"The second question raised by the learned Respondent’s counsel
is whether the"
"Appellants are bound and obliged to comply with proviso of Section 769 of the"
"Civil Procedure Code to produce sufficient cause in making an application for"
"re-listing."
"In the Jinadasa
and another Vs. Sam Silva and Others
(cited above),
the"
"court by referring to the provision of Section 769 (2) of the Civil Procedure code"
"held at page 250 that,"
"“The
court may have
reinstated the matter upon such terms as
to
costs
or"
"otherwise
as
it
thought
fit,
yet
it
could
only
do
so
if
sufficient
cause
for"
"reinstatement had been established.”"
"In the same case at page 233 states that,"
"“A court will hold that
there was sufficient cause if
the facts and circumstances"
"established
as
forming
the
grounds
for
absence
are
not
absurd,"
"ridiculous,
trifling
or
irrational
but
sensible,
sane,
and
without"
"expecting too much, aggreable to reason.” [emphasis added]"
"The
facts
and
circumstances
established
in
the
present
case
as
forming"
"grounds
for absence are absurd and irrational.
In the absence of sufficient"
"cause, there was no obligation on the High Court to order a reinstatement."
"In these
circumstances and for
the
foregoing
reasons,
the appeal
is hereby"
"dismissed."
