"The
aforesaid
judgment
has
no
application
here
as
the
facts
and
the"
"circumstances in the above case differ
from that of
the case at hand.
In the"
"above cited case,
there was a delay in receiving notice to appear in the court as"
"the Defendant had shifted from his original address and at
the time he was"
"informed,
the appeal had already been dismissed. Nevertheless, the Appellants"
"in the present case were served with notice to be present before the Provincial"
"High Court of Civil Appeal of Uva Province on 09.10.2013. The Appellant has"
"submitted to this court
that
they notified their attorney-at-law of
the date and"
"they were unable to be present on the said date as they reside in Colombo. The"
"said Attorney-at-Law in his affidavit has failed to disclose any reasonable cause"
"for his absence but
rather has stated that,
‘as this was the very first date it"
"was
taken for granted that
it was only to be mentioned for
the purpose of"
"granting
the
next
step
namely
a
date
for
the written submissions
of
the"
"Defendant-Appellants’.
(page number 517 of the brief)"
"The above reason given by the said Attorney-at-Law in his affidavit itself clearly"
"establishes
that he has
failed
to
carry
out his
bounden duty as
the
legal"
"representative of the Appellants."
"In Packiyanathan Vs. Singarajah [1991] 2 Sri L.R 205, Kulatunga, J. held"
"that in page number 209 that,"
"“Relief will not be granted for default in prosecuting an appeal where —"
"(a)
the default has resulted from the negligence of the client or both the client and"
"his attorney-at-law,"
"(b)
the default has resulted from the negligence of
the attorney-at-law in which"
"event
the principle is that
the negligence of
the attorney-at-law is the negligence"
"of the client and the client must suffer for it.”"
"It was further emphasized in this case at page 205 that,"
