"Therefore,
in relation to the third question of
law,
I conclude that
the learned"
"High Court
judge has not erred in law as the Appellants lacked the standard of"
"due diligence expected from them."
"The fourth and fifth questions of
law which the leave was granted by this court"
"can be considered together. Both these questions consider whether
the High"
"Court
failed to take into account
the relevant and/or attendant circumstances"
"and as such err in not exercising the discretion vested in court judicially."
"In this regard, it was held in D.S Ranaweera Vs. W.W.P Jinadasa and another"
"[1992] BAL Vol.IV, Part II at page 20 that,"
"“Dealing
instead,
in
the matter
before
it, with
a mere
invocation
for
the"
"assistance of
the Court of Appeal
in the exercise of
its discretion,
the court had"
"an uncontrolled power of disposal, so long as that power was not exercised in"
"transgression of
the law and legal principles, and so long as it was not actuated"
"by whim or caprice, and exercised in good faith.”"
"In the same case, Amerasinghe J cited the Indian case of Shamdasani and"
"others Vs. Central Bank of
India,
[1938 Bombay 199]. where Chief Justice"
"Beaumont at page 202 stated that,"
"“It
is, after all, a very serious matter
to dismiss a man’s suit or summons, or"
"whatever
if may be, without hearing it, and that course ought not be adopted"
"unless the court is really satisfied that justice so requires.”"
"If
the court
is to wield its discretion to dismiss a case without hearing, such"
"must be done to meet
the ends of
justice.
In the above cited D.S Ranaweera"
"Vs. W.W.P Jinadasa and another
Amerasinghe J. stated that
‘the needs of"
"justice’
go beyond the narrow interest
of
justice
one
or all of
litigants in a"
"matter and further held at page 21 that,"
