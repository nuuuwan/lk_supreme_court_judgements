"proviso of Section 769 of
the Civil Procedure Code to produce sufficient"
"cause in making an application for re-listing?"
"The first matter for consideration by this court is whether the High Court erred"
"in
law by
the
failure
to
take
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
its
order
dated"
"09.10.2013
dismissing
the
appeal
for
want
of
appearance
contains
no"
"consideration of
the merits of
the appeal and as such has been made in breach"
"of Section 769 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code."
"In order
to ascertain the above question of
law,
it
is pivotal
to analyze Section"
"769 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code which states as follows,"
"“(2)
If
the appellant does not appear either in person or by an Attorney-at-Law to"
"support his appeal,
the court shall
consider
the appeal and make such order"
"thereon as it thinks fit."
"Provided that,
on sufficient
cause
shown,
it
shall be
lawful
for
the Court
of"
"Appeal
to reinstate upon such terms as the court shall
think fit any appeal
that"
"has been dismissed under this subsection”."
"The
position
of
the
Appellant
is
that
the
court
has
a
duty
under
the"
"aforementioned
section
to
consider
the
appeal
before making
any
order"
"thereon,
in instances where the Appellant does not appear and the Learned"
"High Court
Judge has
failed
in his
duty.
In support
of
this
position,
the"
"counsel
for
the Appellant has relied on the decision in the case of M. H. M."
"Suweyal Vs. Pandigamage Podinona,
[S.C. Appeal No. 92A/2008] decided on"
"05.07.2017.
In this judgment, Hon. Justice Aluwihare set aside the order of"
"the High Court dismissing the Appeal and emphasized on the duty of the court"
"to consider the merits of the appeal before making an order for dismissal."
