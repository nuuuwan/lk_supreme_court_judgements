"In Kanagasabai Vs. Kirupamoorthy [1959] 62 N.L.R. 45, while stating that if"
"parties
are
required
by
law or
by
court
to be present,
then they must be"
"present Bansanayake CJ held at page 58 that,"
"“Where, as in this case, the party is required to appear in person and he does not"
"do so then he must suffer
the consequences of his non-appearance.
It
is not"
"sufficient
to say that he gave a proxy to a Proctor and that the Proctor"
"failed to appear by an “ oversight”.
[emphasis added]"
"In the present case, the Appellant’s cannot avert their duty to proceed with due"
"diligence merely
by
stating
that
they
paid
the
brief
fees
and
retained
an"
"attorney. The Appellants are required to appear in the court on the given date"
"either in person or through their attorney. If neither of them appear, there is no"
"way for the court
to determine whether there is a case to proceed or not. In the"
"case
at hand,
the Appellant’s
attorney has
stated
that
they
thought
their"
"presence was not necessary.
(page 518 of
the brief) The Appellants have stated"
"that
they were unable to present on the said date on the sole reason of
them"
"being residents of Colombo.
(the petition of the Appellants to this court)"
"Thus,as I have already discussed,
the reason given by the Appellant’s attorney"
"for his absence is absurd and intolarable. Hence, even if
it was the absence of"
"due diligence of the Appellant’s attorney which alone resulted in the challenged"
"decision of
the High Court, such is indefensible according to “the negligence of"
"the proctor is in law the negligence of the client” and “the client must suffer for"
"his
proctor’s
negligence”
principles
as
it
was
discussed
in
the
case
of"
"Packiyanathan
Vs.
Singarajah
(cited
above).
As
this
court
has
already"
"established in Pakir Mohideen Vs. Mohamadu Casim and Schareguivel v Orr"
"(cited above)
it
is the party who suffers when the attorney who was under a"
"duty to have appeared for him fails to appear without sufficient case, yet,
that"
"is
not
a
factor
to
be
considered
in deciding whether
a matter
should
be"
"considered"
