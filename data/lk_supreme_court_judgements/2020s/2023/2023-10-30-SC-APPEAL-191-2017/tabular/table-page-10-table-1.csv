"“A mere mistake
can
generally
be
excused;
but
not
negligence,
especially"
"continuing negligence. The decision will depend on the facts and circumstances"
"of each case. The Court will
in granting relief ensure that
its order will"
"not
condone
or
in any manner
encourage
the neglect of professional"
"duties expected of Attorneys-at-Law.” [emphasis added]"
"Similarly,
in Pakir Mohideen Vs. Mohamadu Casim [1900]
04 N.L.R 299,"
"Bonser, C.J. held that,"
"“If the Proctor did not do his duty, he is to blame for the absence of the defendant"
"and the defendant must suffer for the fault of his position.”"
"This
sentiment
is
similarly
echoed in Schareguivel v Orr
[1926] 11 N.L.R"
"302, where Lyall Grant J. held that,"
"“To my mind facts indicate that
there was negligence on the part of
the proctor"
"and
not
personal
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
Plaintiff.
That
however
is"
"immaterial. The plaintiff must suffer
for his proctor's negligence. This is clearly"
"laid down by Bonser CJ in Pakir Mohideen v Mohamadu Cassim (4 NLR 299).”"
"In
the
present
case,
both
the
Appellant
and
their
Attorney-at-Law were"
"informed of
the date to appear in advance. However, neither of
them appeared"
"in court on the due date.
It must be noted that
they were not prevented from"
"attending by an unavoidable cause. The reason given by the Appellant
is that"
"they reside in Colombo and could not come to Badulla on the date the appeal"
"was
taken.
They
further
state
that
they
informed
their
attorney
and
the"
"attorney
states he took the date as ‘granted’. Both the Appellants and their"
"attorney have ‘assumed that
their presence was not necessary as this was only"
"a calling date’.
(page 517 and 518 of
the brief)
In my view,
these reasons given"
"by the Appellants are absurd and the negligence on their side is unjustifiable."
