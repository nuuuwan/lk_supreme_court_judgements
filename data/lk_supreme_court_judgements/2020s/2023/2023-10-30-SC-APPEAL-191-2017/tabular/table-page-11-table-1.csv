"With regard
to
the
first
question of
law,
I
direct my
focus
to
the
case
of"
"Appuhamy Vs. Appuhamy [1911] 14 N.L.R. 233, where Wood Renton, J. held"
"at page 236 that,"
"“The Court has undoubtedly a discretion as to whether or not an appeal shall be"
"dismissed, when it
is first called for hearing, on the ground of non-appearance,"
"and we exercise that discretion every day”."
"I am of
the opinion that
the learned High Court
judge in the present case has"
"wielded the said discretion in the interest of
justice. Therefore,
I answer
the"
"first question of
law in negative on the ground that
the duty to consider
the"
"appeal before dismissal
on default
of appearance
of
the Appellant does not"
"become a mandatory duty in situations where there is negligence on the part of"
"the Appellants."
"The second matter
for consideration by this court
is whether
the High Court"
"erred in law by dismissing the appeal as the said appeal did not come up for"
"“hearing” as contemplated by Section 769 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code."
"The position of
the Appellant on this regard is that
the said appeal was not"
"taken up for
‘hearing’ under Section 769 (1) of
the Civil Procedure Code on"
"09.10.2013 but was merely a calling date. Therefore,
the appeal
is not liable to"
"be dismissed."
"Nonetheless,
in The General
Insurance Company Ltd Vs. T.A.Don Abraham"
"[1957] 59 N.L.R 282, Basnayake, C.J, in page 284 stated that,"
"“For
the
purpose
of section
769
an
appeal “ comes
on
for
hearing ” each"
"time it
is
on the daily list.
If
the appellant or his
counsel
is not present when"
"the
appeal
is
called in
Court
whether
for
the purpose
of hearing the"
"submissions
of
counsel
or
for.
any
other
purpose,
it
is
liable
to
be"
"dismissed”. [emphasis added]"
