"attorneys as definite court appointments which the absence will not be excused"
"without a justifiable cause."
"In the present case,
the reason that the attorney was out of Badulla on the day"
"that
the case was taken cannot under any circumstance be excused. Therefore,"
"I am of
the opinion that every ‘calling date’ of a case must be considered as a"
"date for
‘hearing’ under Section 769 (1) of
the Civil Procedure Code and the"
"second question of
law must also be answered in negative."
"The third question for consideration is whether the High Court erred in holding"
"that
the
petitioners had not prosecuted the
civil appeal with due diligence"
"when
the
Appellant
had
paid
the
brief-fees
and
instructed
their"
"Attorney-at-Law to appear on their behalf."
"In order
to examine the legal
issue raised above,
it
is important
to first define"
"‘due
diligence’
expected
from an Appellant
in an appeal.
The
phrase
‘due"
"diligence’ has been defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary, 2nd Ed. as,"
"“Such a measure of prudence, activity or assiduity, as is properly to be expected"
"from, and ordinarily
exercised by, a reasonable and prudent man under
the"
"particular
circumstances;
not
measured
by
any
absolute
standard,
but"
"depending on the relative facts of the special case.”"
"The Appellant has paid brief
fees and has received notices to appear before the"
"court on 09.10.2013. However,
the Appellant or
their attorney did not appear"
"on the
said date as they ‘thought
it was not necessary’ since it was only a"
"calling date. The standard of due diligence expected from an Appellant does not"
"stop once he has paid the brief
fees and retained an attorney. It is the assiduity"
"expected from a person whose rights have been violated and such assiduity"
"must continue until he or she receives justice."
