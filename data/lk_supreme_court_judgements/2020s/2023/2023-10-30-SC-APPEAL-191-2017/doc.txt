K.KUMUDINI WICKREMASINGHE, J.

This is an appeal from an order of the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal of

the Uva Province holden in Badulla dated 24.02.2016 which dismissed the

applicationmadebytheAppellantstore-listtheAppealbearingNo.

UVA/HCCA/BDL/ 01/13/F, after the said appeal was dismissed by the same

courton09.10.2013forwant of appearance of the Appellant, or their

Attorney-at-Law.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the Respondent) instituted the initial action in the District Court of Badulla

againstthe1stand2ndDefendants-Appellants-Petitioners-Appellants

(hereinafterreferredtoastheAppellants)andthe3rd

Defendant-Appellant-Respondent-Respondent seeking to recover a sum of Rs.

7,126,338.17 and interest thereon. The Respondent stated that the said sum

was owed by way of temporary overdrafts granted to one M.H.B Company of

whichAppellantswerepartners.TheAppellanttogetherwiththe3rd

Defendant-Appellant-Respondent-Respondentsoughtthedismissalofthe

Respondents action and contended that there was a case filed earlier by them

before Commercial High Court bearing No. L/C/Civil/268/09/MR seeking to

recover damages against the Respondent.

When the case was taken up for trial in the District Court, the Appellant raised

a preliminary objection that the District Court of Badulla has no jurisdiction to

hear the case, and the case should be transferred to the Commercial High

Court of Colombo having regard to the value of the claim. The said preliminary

objection was overruled by the District Court by an order dated 31.05.2012

stating that the Appellant has accepted the jurisdiction of the District Court in

their answer and any objection on such should have been raised at that stage.

The Learned District Court Judge also refused two more applications made by

the Appellants to postpone the trial pending a Leave to Appeal application

5

bearing No.UVA/ HCCA/ BDL/LA/13/2012 and a Revision Application bearing

No. HC/RA/14/12 being made by the Appellants against the said District

Court order and for postponements to cross-examine a witness.

The District Court delivered the judgment dated 28.09.2012 in favour of the

Respondent. In the judgment, the Learned District Court stated that in the

absence of a stay order, there was no legal obligation to await the outcome of

the Revision and Leave to appeal applications and although the witnesses were

not cross-examined, the Appellants counsel was present in court on all trial

dates.Thereafter,theHighCourtdeliveredtheorder dated 18.10.2012

dismissing the said Leave to Appeal and Revision applications.

Aggrieved by the judgment of the Learned District Court Judge of Badulla, the

Appellants appealed to the High Court of Civil Appeal of the Uva Province,

Badulla. The Appellant were served with notice to be present before the High

Court on 09.10.2013 and on the said date neither the Appellants nor their

attorney-at-lawwerepresent.TheProvincialHigh Court of Civil Appeal

dismissed the appeal of the Appellants stating that it appears that the

Appellants are not proceeding with the appeal with due diligence. (page 488 of

the brief) Thereafter, the Appellants filed an application to re-list the said

appeal and the Provincial High Court of Civil Appeal refused the application for

re-listing by the order dated 24.02.2016.

The Appellant is before this court challenging the said order. This court by

order dated 03.10.2017 granted Leave to Appeal on the questions of law stated

in paragraph 19 (a) to (e) of the Petition dated 04.04.2016, as set out below.

1. Did the Civil Appellate High Court err by the omission to take cognizance

of the fact that its order dated 09.10.2013 dismissing the appeal for want

of appearance contains no consideration whatsoever of the merits of the

6

said appeal and as such has been made in breach of Section 769 (2) of

the Civil Procedure Code?

2. Did the Civil Appellate High Court misdirect itself in law by the failure to

consider that it was not competent for the said court to have made an

order of dismissal inasmuch as the said appeal did not come up for

hearing as contemplated by Section 769 (1) of the Civil Procedure

Code?

3. Did the High Court of Civil Appeal misdirect itself by its failure to take

cognizance of the fact that the Petitioners had paid the brief-fees and

instructed their Attorney-at-Law to appear on their behalf before the said

court, and thereby, err in holding that the petitioners had not prosecuted

the civil appeal with due diligence?

4. Did the Civil Appellate High Court fail to take into consideration the

attendant circumstances in making the said order of dismissal?

5. In making the said orders, did the Civil Appellate High Court fail to take

intoaccounttherelevantcircumstancesandassucherrinnot

exercising the discretion vested in court judicially?

In addition, the Learned Counsel for the Respondent has raised the following

issues.

a) Whether the order of the Lordships of the High Court appeal dated

24.02.2016 is in compliance with the provisions of Section 769 of the

Civil Procedure Code in view of the non-appearance of the Petitioners

before court?

7

b) In such an event, are the petitioners bound and obliged to comply with

proviso of Section 769 of the Civil Procedure Code to produce sufficient

cause in making an application for re-listing?

The first matter for consideration by this court is whether the High Court erred

in law by the failure to take cognizance of the fact that its order dated

09.10.2013dismissingtheappealforwantofappearancecontainsno

consideration of the merits of the appeal and as such has been made in breach

of Section 769 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

In order to ascertain the above question of law, it is pivotal to analyze Section

769 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code which states as follows,

(2) If the appellant does not appear either in person or by an Attorney-at-Law to

support his appeal, the court shall consider the appeal and make such order

thereon as it thinks fit.

Provided that, on sufficient cause shown, it shall be lawful for the Court of

Appeal to reinstate upon such terms as the court shall think fit any appeal that

has been dismissed under this subsection.

ThepositionoftheAppellantis that the court has a duty under the

aforementionedsectiontoconsiderthe appeal before making any order

thereon, in instances where the Appellant does not appear and the Learned

High Court Judge has failed in his duty. In support of this position, the

counsel for the Appellant has relied on the decision in the case of M. H. M.

Suweyal Vs. Pandigamage Podinona, [S.C. Appeal No. 92A/2008] decided on

05.07.2017.In this judgment, Hon. Justice Aluwihare set aside the order of

the High Court dismissing the Appeal and emphasized on the duty of the court

to consider the merits of the appeal before making an order for dismissal.

8

Theaforesaidjudgmenthasnoapplicationhereasthefactsandthe

circumstances in the above case differ from that of the case at hand. In the

above cited case, there was a delay in receiving notice to appear in the court as

the Defendant had shifted from his original address and at the time he was

informed, the appeal had already been dismissed. Nevertheless, the Appellants

in the present case were served with notice to be present before the Provincial

High Court of Civil Appeal of Uva Province on 09.10.2013. The Appellant has

submitted to this court that they notified their attorney-at-law of the date and

they were unable to be present on the said date as they reside in Colombo. The

said Attorney-at-Law in his affidavit has failed to disclose any reasonable cause

for his absence but rather has stated that, as this was the very first date it

was taken for granted that it was only to be mentioned for the purpose of

granting the next step namely a date for the written submissions of the

Defendant-Appellants. (page number 517 of the brief)

The above reason given by the said Attorney-at-Law in his affidavit itself clearly

establishes that he has failed to carry out his bounden duty as the legal

representative of the Appellants.

In Packiyanathan Vs. Singarajah [1991] 2 Sri L.R 205, Kulatunga, J. held

that in page number 209 that,

Relief will not be granted for default in prosecuting an appeal where

(a) the default has resulted from the negligence of the client or both the client and

his attorney-at-law,

(b) the default has resulted from the negligence of the attorney-at-law in which

event the principle is that the negligence of the attorney-at-law is the negligence

of the client and the client must suffer for it.

It was further emphasized in this case at page 205 that,

9

A mere mistake can generally be excused; but not negligence, especially

continuing negligence. The decision will depend on the facts and circumstances

of each case. The Court will in granting relief ensure that its order will

not condone or in any manner encourage the neglect of professional

duties expected of Attorneys-at-Law. [emphasis added]

Similarly, in Pakir Mohideen Vs. Mohamadu Casim [1900]04 N.L.R 299,

Bonser, C.J. held that,

If the Proctor did not do his duty, he is to blame for the absence of the defendant

and the defendant must suffer for the fault of his position.

This sentiment is similarly echoed in Schareguivel v Orr [1926] 11 N.L.R

302, where Lyall Grant J. held that,

To my mind facts indicate that there was negligence on the part of the proctor

and not personal negligence on the part of the Plaintiff. That however is

immaterial. The plaintiff must suffer for his proctor's negligence. This is clearly

laid down by Bonser CJ in Pakir Mohideen v Mohamadu Cassim (4 NLR 299).

In the present case, both the Appellant and their Attorney-at-Law were

informed of the date to appear in advance. However, neither of them appeared

in court on the due date. It must be noted that they were not prevented from

attending by an unavoidable cause. The reason given by the Appellant is that

they reside in Colombo and could not come to Badulla on the date the appeal

was taken. They further state that they informed their attorney and the

attorney states he took the date as granted. Both the Appellants and their

attorney have assumed that their presence was not necessary as this was only

a calling date. (page 517 and 518 of the brief) In my view, these reasons given

by the Appellants are absurd and the negligence on their side is unjustifiable.

10

With regard to the first question of law, I direct my focus to the case of

Appuhamy Vs. Appuhamy [1911] 14 N.L.R. 233, where Wood Renton, J. held

at page 236 that,

The Court has undoubtedly a discretion as to whether or not an appeal shall be

dismissed, when it is first called for hearing, on the ground of non-appearance,

and we exercise that discretion every day.

I am of the opinion that the learned High Court judge in the present case has

wielded the said discretion in the interest of justice. Therefore, I answer the

first question of law in negative on the ground that the duty to consider the

appeal before dismissal on default of appearance of the Appellant does not

become a mandatory duty in situations where there is negligence on the part of

the Appellants.

The second matter for consideration by this court is whether the High Court

erred in law by dismissing the appeal as the said appeal did not come up for

hearing as contemplated by Section 769 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

The position of the Appellant on this regard is that the said appeal was not

taken up for hearing under Section 769 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code on

09.10.2013 but was merely a calling date. Therefore, the appeal is not liable to

be dismissed.

Nonetheless, in The General Insurance Company Ltd Vs. T.A.Don Abraham

[1957] 59 N.L.R 282, Basnayake, C.J, in page 284 stated that,

Forthepurposeof section 769 an appeal comes on for hearing each

time it ison the daily list.If the appellant or his counsel is not present when

theappeal iscalled inCourtwhether forthe purposeof hearing the

submissions ofcounselorfor.any other purpose, it is liable to be

dismissed. [emphasis added]

11

In Jinadasa and another Vs. Sam Silva and Others [1994] 1 Sri L.R. 232,

Amerasinghe J, stated at page 248 that,

A judge must ensure a prompt disposition of cases, emphasising that dates

given by the court, including dates set out in lists published by a courts

registry, for hearing or other purposes, must be regarded by the parties

and their counsel as definite court appointments. No postponements must

be granted, or absence excused, except upon emergencies occurring after the

fixing of the date, which could not have been anticipated or avoided with

reasonable diligence, and which cannot be otherwise provided for. [emphasis

added]

In the same judgment, Amerasinghe, J. has cited the Abdul Aziz v. Punjab

National Bank [AIR 1929 Lahore 96, 99, 100]., where Jai Lai, J. has stated

that,

In this connection due regard must be had to the nature of duties of counsel

towards his other clients and the other courts. At the same time the court cannot

be expected to give unlimited or unreasonable latitude to counsel in this respect.

Counsel is ordinarily expected to be ready in court when the case is called and it

is no good excuse to say he was busy elsewhere. [emphasis added]

As previously mentioned, the Appellants as well as their attorney assumed that

their presence was not necessary as this was only a calling date. (page 517

and 518 of the brief) Thus, the attorney has stated that he went out of Badulla

on the date the case was taken into consideration. (page 517 of the brief) I

must emphasize that every attorney has a duty towards his client as well as to

the court and attorneys must assist the Judges in prompt disposition of cases.

As stated in the case of Jinadasa and another Vs. Sam Silva and Others

(above cited) every date where the case comes for hearing or for any other

purpose, including, calling dates must be regarded by the parties and their

12

attorneys as definite court appointments which the absence will not be excused

without a justifiable cause.

In the present case, the reason that the attorney was out of Badulla on the day

that the case was taken cannot under any circumstance be excused. Therefore,

I am of the opinion that every calling date of a case must be considered as a

date for hearing under Section 769 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code and the

second question of law must also be answered in negative.

The third question for consideration is whether the High Court erred in holding

that the petitioners had not prosecuted the civil appeal with due diligence

whentheAppellanthadpaidthebrief-feesandinstructedtheir

Attorney-at-Law to appear on their behalf.

In order to examine the legal issue raised above, it is important to first define

due diligence expected from an Appellant in an appeal. The phrase due

diligence has been defined in the Blacks Law Dictionary, 2nd Ed. as,

Such a measure of prudence, activity or assiduity, as is properly to be expected

from, and ordinarilyexercised by, a reasonable and prudent man under the

particularcircumstances;notmeasuredbyanyabsolutestandard,but

depending on the relative facts of the special case.

The Appellant has paid brief fees and has received notices to appear before the

court on 09.10.2013. However, the Appellant or their attorney did not appear

on the said date as they thought it was not necessary since it was only a

calling date. The standard of due diligence expected from an Appellant does not

stop once he has paid the brief fees and retained an attorney. It is the assiduity

expected from a person whose rights have been violated and such assiduity

must continue until he or she receives justice.

13

In Kanagasabai Vs. Kirupamoorthy [1959] 62 N.L.R. 45, while stating that if

parties are required by law or by court to be present, then they must be

present Bansanayake CJ held at page 58 that,

Where, as in this case, the party is required to appear in person and he does not

do so then he must suffer the consequences of his non-appearance. It is not

sufficient to say that he gave a proxy to a Proctor and that the Proctor

failed to appear by an oversight. [emphasis added]

In the present case, the Appellants cannot avert their duty to proceed with due

diligence merely by stating that they paid the brief fees and retained an

attorney. The Appellants are required to appear in the court on the given date

either in person or through their attorney. If neither of them appear, there is no

way for the court to determine whether there is a case to proceed or not. In the

case at hand, the Appellants attorney has stated that they thought their

presence was not necessary. (page 518 of the brief) The Appellants have stated

that they were unable to present on the said date on the sole reason of them

being residents of Colombo. (the petition of the Appellants to this court)

Thus,as I have already discussed, the reason given by the Appellants attorney

for his absence is absurd and intolarable. Hence, even if it was the absence of

due diligence of the Appellants attorney which alone resulted in the challenged

decision of the High Court, such is indefensible according to the negligence of

the proctor is in law the negligence of the client and the client must suffer for

hisproctorsnegligenceprinciplesasitwasdiscussedinthe case of

PackiyanathanVs.Singarajah(citedabove). As this court has already

established in Pakir Mohideen Vs. Mohamadu Casim and Schareguivel v Orr

(cited above) it is the party who suffers when the attorney who was under a

duty to have appeared for him fails to appear without sufficient case, yet, that

is not a factor to be considered in deciding whether a matter should be

considered

14

Therefore, in relation to the third question of law, I conclude that the learned

High Court judge has not erred in law as the Appellants lacked the standard of

due diligence expected from them.

The fourth and fifth questions of law which the leave was granted by this court

can be considered together. Both these questions consider whether the High

Court failed to take into account the relevant and/or attendant circumstances

and as such err in not exercising the discretion vested in court judicially.

In this regard, it was held in D.S Ranaweera Vs. W.W.P Jinadasa and another

[1992] BAL Vol.IV, Part II at page 20 that,

Dealing instead, in the matter before it, with a mere invocation for the

assistance of the Court of Appeal in the exercise of its discretion, the court had

an uncontrolled power of disposal, so long as that power was not exercised in

transgression of the law and legal principles, and so long as it was not actuated

by whim or caprice, and exercised in good faith.

In the same case, Amerasinghe J cited the Indian case of Shamdasani and

others Vs. Central Bank of India, [1938 Bombay 199]. where Chief Justice

Beaumont at page 202 stated that,

It is, after all, a very serious matter to dismiss a mans suit or summons, or

whatever if may be, without hearing it, and that course ought not be adopted

unless the court is really satisfied that justice so requires.

If the court is to wield its discretion to dismiss a case without hearing, such

must be done to meet the ends of justice. In the above cited D.S Ranaweera

Vs. W.W.P Jinadasa and anotherAmerasinghe J. stated that the needs of

justice go beyond the narrow interest of justice one or all of litigants in a

matter and further held at page 21 that,

15

The needs and expectations ofthe community as a whole in the due

administration of justice must be considered. Interest rei publicae ut sit finis

litum.

In the same case, it was held at page 23 that the court would order

reinstatement in an application dismissed for want of appearance only if the

defaulting party furnished the court with a comprehensive and satisfactory

disclosure of all attendant circumstances.

In the present case, the attendant circumstances are not satisfactory as such

do not elucidate any reasonable or sensible explanation that justify the

absence of the Appellants attorney at the High Court on the said date. If this

court is to allow this sort of irresponsible behavior of an attorney, it will lead to

the erosion of professionalism in this noble profession. Even though it is very

unfortunate in the present case that the Appellant has to suffer for the fault of

their attorney, this one partys grievances must be overridden by the necessity

to protect the interests of justice. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the

learned High Court judge has correctly exercised his discretion in dismissing

the application by the Appellants for re-listing to preserve the interests of

justice.

In addition to the above questions of law, the Learned Counsel for the

Respondent has two more questions. The first question is whether the order of

the High Court appeal is in compliance with the provisions of Section 769 of

the Civil Procedure Code in view of the non-appearance of the Petitioners before

court. As I have already discussed, the court has wide discretion in relation to

the dismissal of cases. However, if the court is to dismiss a case without giving

a hearing, such has to be done only when the justice so requires and justice so

requires in the present case.

16

The second question raised by the learned Respondents counsel is whether theAppellants are bound and obliged to comply with proviso of Section 769 of theCivil Procedure Code to produce sufficient cause in making an application forre-listing.

In the Jinadasa and another Vs. Sam Silva and Others (cited above), thecourt by referring to the provision of Section 769 (2) of the Civil Procedure codeheld at page 250 that,

The court may have reinstated the matter upon such terms as to costs orotherwise as it thought fit, yet it could only do so if sufficient cause forreinstatement had been established.

In the same case at page 233 states that,

A court will hold that there was sufficient cause if the facts and circumstancesestablishedasformingthegroundsforabsencearenotabsurd,ridiculous,triflingorirrationalbutsensible,sane,andwithoutexpecting too much, aggreable to reason. [emphasis added]

The facts and circumstances established in the present case as forminggrounds for absence are absurd and irrational. In the absence of sufficientcause, there was no obligation on the High Court to order a reinstatement.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, the appeal is herebydismissed.
