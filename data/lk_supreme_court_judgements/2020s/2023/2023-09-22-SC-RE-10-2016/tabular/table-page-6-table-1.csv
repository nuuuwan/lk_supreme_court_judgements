"(4)  An appeal shall lie directly to the Supreme Court on any matter and in the"
"manner specifically provided for by any other law passed by Parliament."
"Article 128 (1), (2), (3) refers only to appeals from orders or judgements of the Court of Appeal."
"The instant matter is neither an appeal nor against an order or judgement of the Court of Appeal."
"Thus, Articles 128 (1), (2), (3) have no relevance to the instant application. Article 128 (4) of the"
"Constitution also refers only to appeals. Since the instant matter is not an appeal Article 128 (4)"
"is also not relevant to this application."
"In Martin Vs Wijewardena.2 Jameel J (with Ranasinghe CJ and Amerasinghe J agreeing) stated"
"that the right of appeal is a statutory right and must be expressly created and granted by statute."
"In Mariam Beebee Vs. Seyed Mohamed,3 Sansoni C.J. who delivered the majority decision of the"
"Divisional Bench which heard that case stated that the power of revision is an extraordinary power"
"which is quite independent of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of the Court."
