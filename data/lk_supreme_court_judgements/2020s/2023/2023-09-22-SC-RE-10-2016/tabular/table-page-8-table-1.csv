"Let me also have the indulgence to refer to the case of Udaya Saman Subhasinghe Vs. People’s"
"Merchant  PLC.8  The  Petitioner  -  Respondent  in  that  case  (People’s  Merchant  PLC)  raised  a"
"preliminary objection to the maintainability of that appeal stating that there is no legal provision"
"which provided a right of appeal for the Respondent-Appellant (Udaya Saman Subhasinghe) i.e.,"
"to file such an appeal to this Court without first obtaining the leave of the Supreme Court on a"
"question of law, against the impugned order made by the High Court under section 31 (1) of the"
"Arbitration Act. The learned counsel who appeared for the Respondent - Appellant in that case,"
"conceded that the Respondent - Appellant had not first obtained the leave of the Supreme Court"
"on a question of law in that appeal. However, he thereafter submitted that this Court nevertheless"
"has  jurisdiction  to  entertain  this  appeal  both  under  Article  127  of  the  Constitution  and  in  the"
"exercise of revisionary powers of this Court. With the concurrence of Her Ladyship Murdu N. B."
"Fernando PC J and His Lordship A. H. M. D. Nawaz J, I took the view that this Court does not"
"have revisionary powers to intervene and consider that appeal."
"In the above circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, I am of the view that this Court does"
"not have Revisionary Jurisdiction to intervene and consider the instant application. I proceed to"
"dismiss this application."
