"had not been physically separated, having the land fenced soon after purchasing the land"
"and having his name registered in the register at the local authority. Even though the 3rd"
"Defendant gave evidence, he did not state if he did any of the above, except that he used"
"to clean the said land regularly."
"O
n the contrary, the position of the Plaintiff that she has been in possession of the land"
"at all  times has been  supported by the evidence of  the Grama Niladari. I have already"
"stated that the Plaintiff had the land sub-divided into two lots three months prior to the"
"execution of the impugned Deed, and that it is only one lot, namely A1, that is the subject"
"matter  of  this  appeal.  Although  Plan  No.  554/2003  was  produced  and  marked  by  the"
"Plaintiff, the Plaintiff did not explain the reason or the necessity for the sub-division of"
"the  land  into  Lots  A1  and  A2,  nor  was  she  cross-examined  on  this  issue  by  any  of  the"
"Defendants. The learned Counsel for the 3rd Defendant has raised before this Court the"
"issue  of  the  land  being  sub-divided  just  three  months  before  the  execution  of  the"
"impugned Deed in order to support his position that the intention of the Plaintiff was to"
"transfer  the  beneficial  interest  in  the  lot  referred  to  in  the  said  Deed.  However,  I  am"
"unable  to  draw  any  adverse  inference  in  the  absence  of  this  issue  having  been  raised"
"during cross-examination."
"W
hat is important is the evidence of the Plaintiff that the two lots were not separated by"
"a fence and that she continued to occupy and possess both lots of land even after the"
"transfer was executed in favour of the 1st Defendant. The Grama Niladari stated that the"
"Plaintiff occupied the  entire land and that in fact, until he  was cross-examined on this"
"issue, he did not even know the land had been sub-divided into two lots for the reason"
"that there was no physical demarcation of the lots on the ground. The Plaintiff also stated"
"that even though her house was situated on Lot A2, her toilet was situated on Lot A1, a"
"fact which has been corroborated by the evidence of the Valuer. None of the Defendants"
"have  questioned  the  Plaintiff  on  her  sanitation  facilities  being  situated  on  Lot  A1  and"
"whether she had alternative arrangements on Lot A2. The Plaintiff stated further that she"
"had a chicken pen on Lot A1 and that it was she who enjoyed the fruits of the said lot of"
"land."
