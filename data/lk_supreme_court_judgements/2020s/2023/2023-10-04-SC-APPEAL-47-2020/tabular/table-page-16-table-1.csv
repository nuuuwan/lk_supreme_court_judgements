"The second matter that I wish to refer to, which explains the reason for the Plaintiff to"
"have approached the 1st Defendant to fulfil her immediate need for money, and the long"
"time  taken  for  her  to  seek  redress  from  Court,  is  the  blood  relationship  that  existed"
"between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant, who in addition was personally known to her"
"and lived about ten houses from where she lived. This relationship in turn appears to have"
"given rise to the implicit trust that the Plaintiff claims that she had in the 1st Defendant,"
"and prompted her to sign a deed of transfer, even though she allegedly had no intention"
"of transferring the land."
