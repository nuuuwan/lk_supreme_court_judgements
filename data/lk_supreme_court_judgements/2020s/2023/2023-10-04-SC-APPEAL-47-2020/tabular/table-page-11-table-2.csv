"Herath Mudiyanselage Gedara Somawathi [SC Appeal No. 173/2011; SC minutes of 6th"
"April 2017], Prasanna Jayawardena, PC, J stated at page 15 that:"
"“The Court has to keep in mind that, a notarially attested deed of transfer should not"
"be lightly declared to be a nullity. The Court must also guard against allowing a false"
"or belated claim of ‘Trust’ made by a transferor who has transferred his property and"
"then had second thoughts or seeks to profit from changed circumstances. Dalton J’s"
"observations made close to 90 years ago in Mohamadu vs. Pathuamma [11 CLR 48"
"at page 49], (that) “It is becoming not uncommon by the mere allegation of a trust"
"to seek to evade the very salutary provisions of (the Evidence) Ordinance to which I"
"have referred,” continues to remain a salutary caution.”"
