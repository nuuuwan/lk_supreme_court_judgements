"A
lthough  a  secret 
intention  on  the  part  of  the  Plaintiff  will  not  be  an  attendant"
"circumstance, 
the  explanation  of 
the  Plaintiff  demonstrates 
that  she  has  clearly"
"communicated  her  intention  to  the  1st  Defendant  and  gives  context  not  only  to  what"
"transpired  thereafter,  but  to  the  attendant  circumstances  that  prompted  the  learned"
"District Judge to hold in favour of the Plaintiff."
"T
he position of the Plaintiff can therefore be summarised as follows:"
"(
a) 
The Plaintiff requested a sum of Rs. 50,000 from the 1st Defendant, who was related"
"to her and whom she trusted, in order to settle debts she had incurred."
"(
b)  While agreeing to give her the money, the 1st Defendant had wanted the said land"
"transferred in his name."
"(c) 
The 1st Defendant had agreed to re-transfer the said land upon the re-payment of"
"the money."
"(d) 
Due to the relationship and the trust that she had in the 1st Defendant, and having"
"clarified with the 1st Defendant that the property would be re-transferred upon re-"
"payment,  she  agreed  to  the  course  of  action  proposed  by  the  1st  Defendant  and"
"thereafter executed the said Deed as an outright transfer, without having specified"
"any conditions relating to the re-transfer of the land."
"P
ossession of the land by the Plaintiff"
"I
 have already stated that none of the Defendants responded to the letters of demand in"
"which  the  Plaintiff  claimed  that  she  was  in  possession  of  the  land.  Although  the  1st"
"Defendant had stated in his answer that he was in possession of the said land, no evidence"
"was placed during the trial to support this position. This applies to the 3rd Defendant as"
"well.  Unlike  the  1st  Defendant,  the  3rd  Defendant  was  a  stranger  to  the  Plaintiff  and"
"therefore should have taken steps that a bona fide purchaser would ordinarily take, such"
"as having a search of title carried out by an Attorney-at-Law, having a fresh survey carried"
"out to determine the exact extent of the land especially since the two lots, A1 and A2,"
"17"
