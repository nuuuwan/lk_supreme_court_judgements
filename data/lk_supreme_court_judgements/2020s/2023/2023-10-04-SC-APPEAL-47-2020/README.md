Obeyesekere, J

The question that arises for determination in this appeal is whether the Plaintiff

Respondent Respondent [the Plaintiff] has conveyed to the 1st Defendant Appellant

Appellant [the 1st Defendant] by Deed No. 4158, the beneficial interest in the land

referred to in the said Deed. The answer to this question would then determine whether

the said land is being held by the 1st Defendant in trust for the Plaintiff, as provided for by

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance.

Facts in brief

By Deed of Declaration No. 3939 dated 16th August 2002, the Plaintiff declared as follows:

(a) The original owner of the land referred to in the said Deed is Kalawilage Don Odiris

Appuhamy;

(b) The said land, which is in extent of 0A 1R 11.90P and depicted in Plan No. 731/2002

dated 19th May 2002, is situated within the limits of the Beruwala Pradeshiya Sabha;

4

(c) Upon the death of Odiris Appuhamy, Kalawilage Don Somipala, who is the son of

Odiris Appuhamy and the husband of the Plaintiff, came into possession of the said

land and occupied the said land for a long period of time;

(d) Don Somipala passed away in 1989 and thereafter, the Plaintiff has been in

undisturbed and uninterrupted possession of the said land;

(e) By virtue of such long possession, she is the owner of the said land.

In June 2003, which is less than one year after the execution of the above Deed of

Declaration, the Plaintiff had the said land sub-divided into two lots marked A1 and A2,

as more fully depicted in Plan No. 554/2003. According to the said Plan, the house of the

Plaintiff and the well used by her had been situated on Lot A2, while the toilet was

situated on Lot A1.

On 21st September 2003, the Plaintiff executed the impugned Deed of Transfer No. 4158

attested by Nadeel Malagoda, Attorney-at-Law, by which she transferred to the 1st

Defendant, who is a relation of hers and who lived close to her house, Lot A1 in Plan No.

554/2003, in extent of 0A 0R 25P. The purchase consideration has been stipulated as Rs.

50,000, with the Notary certifying that the consideration was not paid in his presence. It

must be noted that Deed No. 4158 does not contain any condition relating to the re-

transfer of the said land to the Plaintiff and on the face of it, was an absolute transfer.

By Deed of Transfer No. 4560 executed on 7th March 2004, the 1st Defendant had

transferred Lot A1 to the 2nd Defendant Respondent Respondent [the 2nd Defendant]

for a sum of Rs. 60,000. The 2nd Defendant is said to be a company engaged in money

lending. On 2nd October 2006, the 3rd Defendant Appellant Appellant [the 3rd

Defendant] purchased from the 2nd Defendant the said land by way of Deed of Transfer

No. 221 attested by Nirosha Silva, Attorney-at-Law, for a sum of Rs. 65,000, with the 1st

Defendant signing as a witness and the Attorney-at-Law certifying that the consideration

had been paid prior to the execution of the said Deed.

5

The Plaintiff claims that in 2007, she had requested the 1st Defendant to re-transfer the

said land to her on payment of Rs. 50,000, which is the sum of money that the Plaintiff

received from the 1st Defendant, together with interest, but that the 1st Defendant

rejected the said request. The Plaintiff says that it is at this point that she was informed

by the 1st Defendant that he had mortgaged the land to the 2nd Defendant. The Plaintiff

states that her Attorney-at-Law had thereafter carried out a search at the Land Registry

which revealed the execution of the aforementioned Deeds in favour of the 2nd Defendant

and the 3rd Defendant.

On 20th October 2009, which is six years after the initial conveyance to the 1st Defendant,

and two years after the Plaintiff found out about the execution of the aforementioned

deeds in favour of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, letters of demand have been sent on behalf

of the Plaintiff to all three Defendants claiming that Deed No. 4158 was in fact only a

mortgage, that the said Deed did not seek to convey the beneficial interest in the said

land to the 1st Defendant, that the beneficial interest in the said land remains with the

Plaintiff and that the 1st Defendant is holding the said land in trust for the Plaintiff. The

said letters of demand went on to state that the value of one perch of the said land was

Rs. 125,000 and that the Plaintiff has continued to remain in possession of the said land.

None of the Defendants have responded to the said letters of demand, with the result

that the claim of the Plaintiff that she continues to be in possession of the said land, has

not been rejected by any of the Defendants at the first available opportunity.

Action in the District Court

On 7th December 2009, the Plaintiff instituted action in the District Court of Kalutara

against all three Defendants. In her plaint, while reiterating the aforementioned matters

contained in the letters of demand, the Plaintiff stated that she had been in urgent need

of money to settle a loan that she had taken [,ndf.k ;snq khla yosisfhka f.jsug isoq jq

nejska] and that she had borrowed a sum of Rs. 50,000 from the 1st Defendant to settle the

said loan. The Plaintiff had averred that although she had executed Deed No. 4158 as a

transfer, it was in effect a mortgage and that she did not intend to transfer the beneficial

interest in the said property to the 1st Defendant and further, that the 1st Defendant was

in fact holding the said property in trust for her. The Plaintiff was therefore seeking to

6

contradict the terms of Deed No. 4158, which, as I have noted already, did not contain

any terms or conditions to support the claim of the Plaintiff and was, on the face of it, an

absolute transfer.

The position taken up by the Plaintiff in her plaint thus brought into focus fairly and

squarely the provisions of Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance, which provides a Court with

a mechanism to decipher the real intention of the owner of a property who later claims

that he or she did not intend to transfer the beneficial interest in the property to the

transferee, by considering the attendant circumstances surrounding the said transfer.

The Plaintiff had accordingly sought the following reliefs in her plaint:

(a) A declaration that Lot A1 in Plan No. 554/2003 is held in trust by the 1st Defendant

in favour of the Plaintiff;

(b) A direction that the 1st Defendant re-transfer the said land to the Plaintiff;

(c) A declaration that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are not entitled to the said land on the

Deeds executed in their favour.

While the 1st and 3rd Defendants filed their answers, the 2nd Defendant did not file an

answer and the trial against the 2nd Defendant proceeded ex parte. In his answer, the 1st

Defendant denied the version of the Plaintiff and took up the position that Deed No. 4158

was an outright transfer, a position from which he resiled at the trial. He admitted that

he had mortgaged the property to the 2nd Defendant in order to raise a loan and that the

said loan had been settled by him. While stating that he was in possession of the said

land, the 1st Defendant sought a declaration that he was entitled to the beneficial interest

in the said land. The 3rd Defendant claimed in his answer that he had paid Rs. 170,000 to

the 1st Defendant at the office of the 2nd Defendant to enable the 1st Defendant to settle

the loan that he had taken and for the 2nd Defendant to transfer the said land to him. The

3rd Defendant therefore claimed that he was a bona fide purchaser and that he is in

possession of the said land. Thus, the principal issue raised on behalf of the Plaintiff and

the 1st Defendant revolved on the true nature of Deed No. 4158.

7

At the trial, the Plaintiff gave evidence on her behalf and led the evidence of the Grama

Niladhari of the area and a Valuer, while the 3rd Defendant gave evidence on his behalf.

The Attorney-at-Law for the 1st Defendant, having informed Court that the 1st Defendant

was accepting the position of the Plaintiff, closed the case for the 1st Defendant without

leading any evidence.

Judgment of the District Court

By judgment dated 12th May 2014, the learned District Judge, having applied the

provisions of Section 83, found that the Plaintiff had been in possession of both lots A1

and A2 at all times and that the consideration she received from the 1st Defendant did not

accurately reflect the true value of the land. The learned District Judge, having concluded

that,

(a) the Plaintiff did not intend to transfer the beneficial interest in the said land to the

1st Defendant;

(b) there existed a constructive trust between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant; and

(c) no ownership rights passed to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants by virtue of the deeds

executed in their favour,

delivered judgment in favour of the Plaintiff and directed the 1st Defendant to re-transfer

the said land, i.e., Lot A1, to the Plaintiff upon the payment of Rs. 50,000 by the Plaintiff.

The appeal filed by the 3rd Defendant against the said judgment in the High Court of the

Western Province holden in Kalutara exercising Civil Appellate jurisdiction [the High

Court] was dismissed by the High Court by its judgment delivered on 5th December 2019.

Questions of Law

The 3rd Defendant thereafter sought and obtained leave to appeal from this Court on 10th

June 2020 on the following two questions of law:

8

(1) Have the learned Judges of the High Court failed to consider the fact that the learned

Trial Judge has erred in law by failing to appreciate the necessary ingredients

applicable in establishing a constructive trust?

(2) Have the learned Judges of the High Court as well as the learned Trial Judge failed

to consider and apply attendant circumstances required to establish a constructive

trust in its proper perspective?

In answering the above questions of law, I would consider the findings of the learned

District Judge and the learned Judges of the High Court in the light of the test laid down

in Section 83 and the evidence that was available to the learned District Judge.

Reception of oral evidence of an instrument

There are two laws that I must refer to at the very outset, in order to give context to

Section 83.

The first is the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, of which Section 2 (prior to its amendment

by the Prevention of Frauds (Amendment) Act No. 30 of 2022) provided as follows:

No sale, purchase, transfer, assignment, or mortgage of land or other immovable

property, and no promise, bargain, contract, or agreement for effecting any such

object, or for establishing any security, interest, or incumbrance affecting land or

other immovable property (other than a lease at will, or for any period not exceeding

one month), nor any contract or agreement for the future sale or purchase of any

land or other immovable property, and no notice, given under the provisions of the

Thesawalamai Pre-emption Ordinance, of an intention or proposal to sell any

undivided share or interest in land held in joint or common ownership, shall be in

force or avail in law unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party

making the same, or by some person lawfully authorized by him or her in the

presence of a licensed notary public and two or more witnesses present at the same

time, and unless the execution of such writing, deed, or instrument be duly attested

by such notary and witnesses. [emphasis added]

9

The second is the Evidence Ordinance of which Sections 91 and 92 are relevant and are

re-produced below:

Section 91

When the terms of a contract, or of a grant, or of any other disposition of property

have been reduced by or by consent of the parties to the form of a document, and in

all cases in which any matter is required by law to be reduced to the form of a

document, no evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract, grant,

or other disposition of property, or of such matter, except the document itself, or

secondary evidence of its contents in cases in which secondary evidence is admissible

under the provisions herein before contained. [emphasis added]

Section 92

When the terms of any such contract, grant, or other disposition of property, or any

matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, have been proved

according to the last section, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement shall

be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument, or their representatives

in interest, for the purpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from

its terms. [emphasis added]

None of (a) the exceptions to Section 91 and (b) the provisos to Section 92 arise for

consideration in this appeal.

The cumulative effect of the above provisions is that while the disposition of any

immovable property must be reduced to writing, proving the terms of a deed by which

any immovable property has been transferred can be done only by producing the deed

itself or where permissible by way of secondary evidence and in the manner provided

therefor in the Evidence Ordinance, and no oral evidence can be given to inter alia

contradict the terms of such deed. The resultant position is that oral evidence relating to

any instrument relating to land that seeks to contradict, vary, add to, or subtract the

terms contained in such deed cannot be received by a Court.

10

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance

Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance, however, acts as an exception to the said rule laid

down in Section 92, and reads as follows:

Where the owner of property transfers or bequeaths it, and it cannot reasonably

be inferred, consistently with the attendant circumstances that he intended to

dispose of the beneficial interest therein, the transferee or legatee must hold such

property for the benefit of the owner or his legal representative. [emphasis added]

In Muttammah v Thiyagarajah [62 NLR 559] H.N.G. Fernando, J (as he then was) referring

to Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Section 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance, stated as follows at page 571:

The plaintiff sought to prove the oral promise to reconvey not in order to enforce

that promise, but only to establish an attendant circumstance from which it could

be inferred that the beneficial interest did not pass. Although that promise was of no

force or avail in law by reason of Section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance, it

is nevertheless a fact from which an inference of the nature contemplated in Section

83 of the Trusts Ordinance properly arises. The Prevention of Frauds Ordinance does

not prohibit the proof of such an act. If the arguments of counsel for the appellant

based on the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and on section 92 of the Evidence

Ordinance are to be accepted, then it will be found that not only section 83, but also

many of the other provisions in Chapter IX of the Trusts Ordinance will be nugatory.

If for example attendant circumstances in Section 83 means only matters

contained in an instrument of transfer of property it is difficult to see how a

conveyance of property can be held in trust unless indeed its terms are such as to

create an express trust.

A similar view was expressed in Krishanthy Balasubramanium and Another v Vellayar

Krishnapillai and Wife and Another [SC Appeal No. 28/2008; SC minutes of 24th May

2012] where Sripavan, J (as he then was) referring to the judgment in Dayawathie and

Others v Gunasekera and Another [(1991) 1 Sri LR 115] stated at page 10 that this Court

11

has held that the provisions of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and Section 92 of the

Evidence Ordinance do not bar parole evidence to prove a constructive trust and that the

transferor did not intend to pass the beneficial interest in the property. In such a case,

extrinsic evidence to prove attendant circumstances can be properly received in evidence

to prove a resulting trust.

In Fernando v Fernando and Another [SC Appeal No. 175/2010; SC minutes of 17th

January 2017], Sisira De Abrew, J reiterated at page 10 that, Section 2 of the Prevention

of Frauds Ordinance and Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance do not operate as a bar to

lead parole evidence to prove a constructive trust and to prove that the transferor did not

intend to dispose of beneficial interest in the property.

Section 83 thus being an exception, it has been held that in applying Section 83, Courts

must exercise great caution. In Senadheerage Chandrika Sudarshani v Muthukuda

Herath Mudiyanselage Gedara Somawathi [SC Appeal No. 173/2011; SC minutes of 6th

April 2017], Prasanna Jayawardena, PC, J stated at page 15 that:

The Court has to keep in mind that, a notarially attested deed of transfer should not

be lightly declared to be a nullity. The Court must also guard against allowing a false

or belated claim of Trust made by a transferor who has transferred his property and

then had second thoughts or seeks to profit from changed circumstances. Dalton Js

observations made close to 90 years ago in Mohamadu vs. Pathuamma [11 CLR 48

at page 49], (that) It is becoming not uncommon by the mere allegation of a trust

to seek to evade the very salutary provisions of (the Evidence) Ordinance to which I

have referred, continues to remain a salutary caution.

What is an attendant circumstance?

The application of the test laid down in Section 83 would enable the Court to decide

whether the owner of the property intended to dispose of the beneficial interest in the

said property when he transferred it. Accordingly, the intention of the owner must be

reasonably inferred from, and be consistent with, the attendant circumstances

surrounding the transfer.

12

Aluwihare, PC, J in Watagodagedara Mallika Chandralatha v Herath Mudiyanselage

Punchi Banda and Another [SC Appeal No. 185/2015; SC minutes of 4th December 2017]

emphasised [at page 8] that, One needs to bear in mind that where a constructive trust

within the meaning of Section 83 of the Trust Ordinance is asserted, it is incumbent on the

court to meticulously examine the evidence placed before the court, the reason being, on

the face value the evidence placed may give the appearance of a straight forward

transaction of a sale but the real intention of the parties can only be gleaned from a close

scrutiny of the circumstances under which the transaction was effected. And the intention

of the parties is of paramount importance.

What, then, would be an attendant circumstance? In Muttammah v Thiyagarajah [supra;

at page 564], Chief Justice Basnayake who delivered the minority opinion, referring to

Section 83 stated as follows:

The section is designed to prevent transfers of property which on the face of the

instrument appear to be genuine transfers, but where an intention to dispose of the

beneficial interest cannot reasonably be inferred consistently with the attendant

circumstances. Neither the declaration of the transferor at the time of the

execution of the instrument nor his secret intentions are attendant circumstances.

Attendant circumstances are to my mind circumstances which precede or follow

the transfer but are not too far removed in point of time to be regarded as

attendant which expression in this context may be understood as accompanying

or connected with. Whether a circumstance is attendant or not would depend on

the facts of each case. [emphasis added]

In Senadheerage Chandrika Sudarshani v Muthukuda Herath Mudiyanselage Gedara

Somawathi [supra; at page 14], Prasanna Jayawardena, PC, J prior to referring to the

above passage of Basnayake, CJ with approval, stated that, The words attendant

circumstances can be broadly described as meaning the facts surrounding the

transaction. In Blacks Law Dictionary (9th Edition) the words attendant circumstance, as

used in the American Law, have been defined as A fact that is situationally relevant to a

particular event or occurrence.

13

Over the years our Courts have identified different circumstances as being attendant

circumstances, and emphasised that, what an attendant circumstance is and the weight

that must be attached to such circumstance in reasonably inferring the intention of the

owner, would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. It would also mean

that a circumstance which is attendant in one case may not be an attendant circumstance

in another.

Dias, J stated thus in Ehiya Lebbe v Majeed [48 NLR 357 at 359]:

There are certain tests for ascertaining into which category a case falls. Thus if the

transferor continued to remain in possession after the conveyance, or if the

transferor paid the whole cost of the conveyance or if the consideration expressed

on the deed is utterly inadequate to what would be the fair purchase money for the

property conveyed all these are circumstances which would show whether the

transaction was a genuine sale for valuable consideration, or something else.

In Thisa Nona and Three Others v Premadasa [(1997) 1 Sri LR 169] Wigneswaran, J held

that the following circumstances which transpired in that case were relevant on the

question whether the transaction was a loan transaction or an outright transfer:

(1) The fact that a non-notarial document was signed by the transferee

contemporaneous to the impugned deed of transfer, agreeing to transfer the land

if the sum of Rs. 1,500 referred to in the deed was paid within six years;

(2) The payment of the stamp duty and the Notarys fees by the transferor;

(3) The fact that the transfer deed came into existence in the course of a series of

money transactions;

(4) The continued possession of the premises in suit by the transferor in the same

manner as she did before the transfer deed was executed.

14

In Carthelis v Ranasinghe [(2002) 2 Sri LR 359] it was held at page 369 that, If it was a

pure and simple transfer, one would expect the title deeds and all other old deeds to be in

the hands of the transferee having obtained them from the transferor, for the purpose of

preparing the deed of transfer.

I am therefore of the view that it is in the light of the sequence of events and the nature

of attendant circumstances peculiar to a case that a Court must arrive at its conclusion on

whether Section 83 of the Trusts Ordinance applies to that particular case or not.

The burden of proof

It is clear that the burden of proof lies on the person who claims that he or she did not

intend to transfer the beneficial interest in the property to the transferee. In

Watagodagedara Mallika Chandralatha v Herath Mudiyanselage Punchi Banda and

Another [supra] Aluwihare, PC, J cited with approval the following passage from The

Reception in Ceylon of the English Trust (1971) by L.J.M. Cooray Where a person has

a notarial conveyance in his favour, courts have placed a heavy burden on the transferor

to prove facts bringing himself within Section 83.

The manner in which the Court must be satisfied that the said burden has been discharged

was considered in Senadheerage Chandrika Sudarshani v Muthukuda Herath

Mudiyanselage Gedara Somawathi [supra], where this Court held as follows:

. the use of the aforesaid words in Section 83 require that, the Court applies an

objective test when determining the intention of the owner from the attendant

circumstances. Therefore, if the claim of a Constructive Trust is to succeed, the

attendant circumstances must make it plainly clear to the reasonable man that,

the owner did not intend to part with his beneficial interest in the property. A

secret or hidden intention to retain the beneficial interest will not do. The attendant

circumstances must be such that they would have demonstrated to the transferee

that the owner intended to retain the beneficial interest in the property. The

transferee is judged here as standing in the shoes of the reasonable man. If a

reasonable man must have known from the attendant circumstances that the

15

owner intended to retain his beneficial interest in the property, the transferee is

deemed to hold the property upon a Constructive Trust in favour of the owner.

However, if a reasonable man may not have drawn such an inference from the

attendant circumstances, the transferee holds the property absolutely, since no

Constructive Trust can be deemed to have arisen. Further, the burden of proof lies

firmly on the person who claims a Constructive Trust to prove it. [page 15; emphasis

added]

At the trial, the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff relied on two principal circumstances in

order to establish his position that the Plaintiff did not intend to transfer to the 1st

Defendant the beneficial interest in the said land firstly, that the Plaintiff has continued

to remain in possession of the said land; and secondly, that the value of the land was

much higher than what was paid to her by the 1st Defendant. These are the two grounds

relied upon by the learned District Judge, as well.

However, prior to considering these two grounds, I shall set out the background to the

transaction as it transpired before the learned Trial Judge, as the said background places

in context the said two grounds urged by the Plaintiff.

The explanation of the Plaintiff for the execution of the Deed

The first matter that I wish to refer to is the purpose for which the Plaintiff required the

money, which in her own words is as follows:

tjeks .Kqfokqjla lsrSfuS wruqK jqfka" uf.a iajdushd wjqreoq 12 la tl ;ek bo,d ke;s jqk fj,dfjs .;a; Kh' mejrSu lr, ;sfnkafka 2003 jraIfha' fus Tmamqj ,shkak re' 50"000$- la ,nd .;a;' fus .Kqfokqj lrk wjia:dfjs thdg b,a,qjdu uu Thdg ,shkakus yosishg msrsuykak" i,a,s fidhdf.k miafi uu fnsr .kakus lshk fmdfrdkaoqj msg oqkafka 1 js;a;slreg'

i,a,s wjYH;djhla jqfka'

Thus, the Plaintiffs position was that she had a specific purpose to obtain a sum of Rs.

50,000 as a loan. Whether her evidence on this issue is credible or not is an issue that I

shall consider in detail, later in this judgment.

16

The second matter that I wish to refer to, which explains the reason for the Plaintiff to

have approached the 1st Defendant to fulfil her immediate need for money, and the long

time taken for her to seek redress from Court, is the blood relationship that existed

between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant, who in addition was personally known to her

and lived about ten houses from where she lived. This relationship in turn appears to have

given rise to the implicit trust that the Plaintiff claims that she had in the 1st Defendant,

and prompted her to sign a deed of transfer, even though she allegedly had no intention

of transferring the land.

Referring to Deed No. 4158, the Plaintiff has stated that:

fus f,aLKh jsl=Kquslrhla f,i ,sh,d ;sfhkafka' jsl=Kquslrhla f,i ,sjsfjs ug f,dl=

[emphasis added]

The Plaintiff thereafter stated that:

fokak lsh,d'

To my mind, the first answer reflects the thinking of the Plaintiff at the time she executed

the Deed that is, the 1st Defendant would hold the said land in trust for her and that the

land would not be sold to a third party without first offering it to her or, in other words,

that the Plaintiff would be entitled to a right of first refusal and a re-transfer of the

property. The second answer makes it clear that the land was to be re-transferred to her.

The Plaintiff has however not been cross-examined on whether she was entitled only to

a right of first refusal and not a re-transfer of the said Deed as of right.

17

Although a secret intention on the part of the Plaintiff will not be an attendant

circumstance, the explanation of the Plaintiff demonstrates that she has clearly

communicated her intention to the 1st Defendant and gives context not only to what

transpired thereafter, but to the attendant circumstances that prompted the learned

District Judge to hold in favour of the Plaintiff.

The position of the Plaintiff can therefore be summarised as follows:

(a) The Plaintiff requested a sum of Rs. 50,000 from the 1st Defendant, who was related

to her and whom she trusted, in order to settle debts she had incurred.

(b) While agreeing to give her the money, the 1st Defendant had wanted the said land

transferred in his name.

(c) The 1st Defendant had agreed to re-transfer the said land upon the re-payment of

the money.

(d) Due to the relationship and the trust that she had in the 1st Defendant, and having

clarified with the 1st Defendant that the property would be re-transferred upon re-

payment, she agreed to the course of action proposed by the 1st Defendant and

thereafter executed the said Deed as an outright transfer, without having specified

any conditions relating to the re-transfer of the land.

Possession of the land by the Plaintiff

I have already stated that none of the Defendants responded to the letters of demand in

which the Plaintiff claimed that she was in possession of the land. Although the 1st

Defendant had stated in his answer that he was in possession of the said land, no evidence

was placed during the trial to support this position. This applies to the 3rd Defendant as

well. Unlike the 1st Defendant, the 3rd Defendant was a stranger to the Plaintiff and

therefore should have taken steps that a bona fide purchaser would ordinarily take, such

as having a search of title carried out by an Attorney-at-Law, having a fresh survey carried

out to determine the exact extent of the land especially since the two lots, A1 and A2,

18

had not been physically separated, having the land fenced soon after purchasing the land

and having his name registered in the register at the local authority. Even though the 3rd

Defendant gave evidence, he did not state if he did any of the above, except that he used

to clean the said land regularly.

On the contrary, the position of the Plaintiff that she has been in possession of the land

at all times has been supported by the evidence of the Grama Niladari. I have already

stated that the Plaintiff had the land sub-divided into two lots three months prior to the

execution of the impugned Deed, and that it is only one lot, namely A1, that is the subject

matter of this appeal. Although Plan No. 554/2003 was produced and marked by the

Plaintiff, the Plaintiff did not explain the reason or the necessity for the sub-division of

the land into Lots A1 and A2, nor was she cross-examined on this issue by any of the

Defendants. The learned Counsel for the 3rd Defendant has raised before this Court the

issue of the land being sub-divided just three months before the execution of the

impugned Deed in order to support his position that the intention of the Plaintiff was to

transfer the beneficial interest in the lot referred to in the said Deed. However, I am

unable to draw any adverse inference in the absence of this issue having been raised

during cross-examination.

What is important is the evidence of the Plaintiff that the two lots were not separated by

a fence and that she continued to occupy and possess both lots of land even after the

transfer was executed in favour of the 1st Defendant. The Grama Niladari stated that the

Plaintiff occupied the entire land and that in fact, until he was cross-examined on this

issue, he did not even know the land had been sub-divided into two lots for the reason

that there was no physical demarcation of the lots on the ground. The Plaintiff also stated

that even though her house was situated on Lot A2, her toilet was situated on Lot A1, a

fact which has been corroborated by the evidence of the Valuer. None of the Defendants

have questioned the Plaintiff on her sanitation facilities being situated on Lot A1 and

whether she had alternative arrangements on Lot A2. The Plaintiff stated further that she

had a chicken pen on Lot A1 and that it was she who enjoyed the fruits of the said lot of

land.

The learned District Judge has considered the above evidence and concluded as follows:

The learned Judges of the High Court have affirmed the judgment of the District Court

only after considering the above evidence. I am in agreement with the above conclusion

and take the view that the Plaintiff has established that she continued to be in possession

of the property at all times, thereby giving rise to a reasonable inference that she did not

intend to transfer the beneficial interest in the said land to the 1st Defendant.

Value of the property

The second ground relied upon by the Plaintiff was that the consideration of Rs. 50,000

that passed from the 1st Defendant to her did not reflect the true value of the land. The

consideration of Rs. 50,000 amounts to Rs. 2,000 per perch. With regard to the value, the

Plaintiff stated that the land was worth Rs. 125,000 per perch at the time she signed the

impugned Deed. The Plaintiff had also obtained through Court a Commission on D.I.

Danthanarayana, an Incorporated Valuer, to ascertain the current market value as well as

the value that prevailed at the time the impugned Deed was executed. He had reported

that the current market value of one perch of the said land was Rs. 30,000 while the

market value at the time the said Deed was executed was Rs. 20,000 per perch. Thus,

even though there was a glaring disparity between the value given by the Plaintiff and the

Court-appointed Valuer, the fact remains that the land was worth well over Rs. 2,000 per

20

perch, thus supporting the version of the Plaintiff that she only obtained a loan from the

1st Defendant and that she did not intend to transfer the beneficial interest in the said

land to the 1st Defendant. The Plaintiff and the Valuer have been cross-examined

extensively on behalf of the 3rd Defendant but mostly with regard to the locality of the

land and the facilities available in the said locality, and not with regard to any specific

aspect of the valuation. It is on this basis that the learned District Judge has concluded

that the consideration set out in the said deed does not reflect the true value of the said

land. These findings have been considered by the High Court, and I see no reason to

disagree with the said findings.

Other attendant circumstances

There are two other circumstances which in my view are attendant circumstances and

confirm the position of the Plaintiff. The first, which has not been considered either by

the District Court or the High Court, is that the original of the Deed of Declaration and the

impugned Deed are with the Plaintiff, and not with the 3rd Defendant, as claimed in the

written submissions filed on behalf of the 3rd Defendant. I say this for the reason that it

was the Plaintiff who produced and marked the originals of the Deed of Declaration and

the impugned Deed as P1 and P3, respectively. The originals are available in the case

record and I have examined same. The simple position here is that if P3 was an absolute

transfer, then, in the absence of any explanation to the contrary, the originals of P1 and

P3 should have been handed over to the 1st Defendant. Furthermore, any bona fide

purchaser, which the 3rd Defendant claims he is, would have sought the originals of the

previous Deeds, especially as he was purchasing the land from the 2nd Defendant. No

explanation has been given by the 3rd Defendant why he did not do so.

The second matter is that the consideration has not passed in the presence of the

Attorney-at-Law before whom the impugned Deed was signed, which supports the

position of the Plaintiff that the transaction was purely monetary and that the execution

of the Deed was nominal.

21

Grounds urged on behalf of the 3rd Defendant

In addition to the submissions on possession and value, the learned Counsel for the 3rd

Defendant presented two other arguments to support his position that a reasonable

inference cannot be drawn that the Plaintiff did not intend to transfer the beneficial

interest in the land to the 1st Defendant.

The first is with regard to the purpose for which the money was required. In the Plaintiffs

own words, the money was required for the following purpose:

fok njg'

As observed by the learned District Judge, the Plaintiff did not produce any further details

with regard to the above-mentioned loans that she had taken, including the dates when

she had taken such loans, from whom she had taken the loans or whether she used the

money to settle such loans. These details become important in view of the fact that in the

Deed of Declaration, the Plaintiff has stated as follows:

,nk nejskao'

In my view, the Plaintiff should have been cross-examined on her explanation as to the

need for the money, especially since her husband is said to have expired in 1989 and the

loan was being raised much later [2003]. However, in the absence of the evidence of the

22

Plaintiff being challenged in cross-examination, it is not possible for this Court to consider

the first argument of the learned Counsel for the 3rd Defendant.

The second is with regard to the arrangement for the repayment of the money. The

learned Counsel for the 3rd Defendant submitted that if Rs. 50,000 was taken as a loan,

there ought to have been an arrangement between the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant

with regard to the re-payment of the said money and the payment of interest. It must be

noted that neither the plaint nor the letters of demand sent on behalf of the Plaintiff

contained any details with regard to the rate of interest, the period within which the

monies should be repaid etc. During cross-examination, the Plaintiff was questioned in

this regard and her position was that she had not paid any interest to the 1st Defendant.

The Plaintiff however claims that when she wanted to repay the money in 2007, she

offered to do so with interest which demonstrates the intention on the part of the Plaintiff

to pay interest. In my view, given the relationship that existed between the Plaintiff and

the 1st Defendant, the failure to agree on the payment of interest, the rate of interest and

the period of re-payment cannot displace the strong attendant circumstances referenced

above, that had been established by evidence and which were relied upon by the learned

Judges of the District Court and the High Court.

Conclusion

Having carefully considered the judgments of the learned District Judge and the learned

Judges of the High Court, I am of the view that:

(a) both Courts have analysed and applied the evidence in light of the test laid down in

Section 83; and

(b) it cannot reasonably be inferred, consistently with the attendant circumstances,

that the Plaintiff intended to dispose of the beneficial interest that she had in Lot

A1, to the 1st Defendant by way of Deed No. 4158.

In the said circumstances, I would answer in the negative the aforementioned questions

of law raised by the 3rd Defendant.

23

I therefore direct that the Plaintiff shall pay to the 1st Defendant a sum of Rs. 50,000

together with legal interest thereon, from 21st September 2003 until the payment of the

said sum of Rs. 50,000 is made. The 1st Defendant shall execute in favour of the Plaintiff a

deed of transfer in respect of Lot A1 in Plan No. 554/2003 upon the aforesaid payment by

the Plaintiff. If the 1st Defendant fails to execute a deed of transfer, the Registrar of the

District Court of Kalutara shall execute a conveyance in favour of the Plaintiff, upon the

Plaintiff depositing the aforementioned sum of money with the Registrar of the District

Court of Kalutara.

Subject to the above, the judgments of the District Court and the High Court are affirmed

and this appeal is dismissed, with costs.
