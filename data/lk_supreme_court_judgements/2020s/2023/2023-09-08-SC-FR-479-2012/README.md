ARGUED &

DECIDED ON : 09/08/2023

P. PADMAN SURASENA, J:

Court heard the submissions of the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners

as well as the submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for

the Respondents and also the submissions of the learned President’s Counsel

appearing for the Intervenient Respondents and concluded the argument of this

case.

According to the Service Minute relevant to the recruitment of Class III officers in

Sri Lanka Administrative Service which is published in the Gazette No. 1419/3

dated 14/11/2005 produced marked P 1, the vacancies in Class III officers in Sri

Lanka Administrative Service must be filled only through two examinations which

are identified in the said Service Minute as the Open Examination and the Limited

Competitive Examination. The Petitioners in this application are candidates who

had sat for the Limited Competitive Examination-20091 held for the recruitment

of Class III officers in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. As the Petitioners in

this application have complained only about the filling of vacancies through the

said Limited Competitive Examination-2009, this Court need not consider at all

about the Open Examination.

1 The Limited Competitive Examination-2009 was held in 2011.

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 15 of 28

Limited Competitive Examination-2009.

It is by the notice produced marked P 3 that the applications from the candidates

have been called for the Limited Competitive Examination-2009. This notice has

been published in the Gazette dated 09/07/2010. It is important to observe that

this Gazette has been published by the Secretary, Ministry of Public

Administration and Home Affairs pursuant to an order of the Cabinet of Ministers.

It has been specifically stated in Clause 02 of the said Gazette P 3, that the

number of vacancies to be filled and the date of appointments will be decided by

Public Service commission/the Cabinet of Ministers.

According to the Gazette No. 1419/3 dated 14/11/2005 produced marked P 1

which is the Service Minute relevant to the recruitment of Class III officers in Sri

Lanka Administrative Service, it has been stated in no uncertain terms, that the

number of vacancies for the recruitment of officers to Class III in any given year,

should be the number of vacancies existing for that post as at 30th June of the

relevant year. As the Petitioners in their argument has urged us to draw a parallel

between the Limited Competitive Examination-2009 and the Limited Competitive

Examination-2010, let us next state below about the Limited Competitive

Examination-2010.

Limited Competitive Examination-2010.

The number of vacancies to be filled through the Limited Competitive

Examination-20102 has been specified in the Gazette No. 1754 dated 11/04/2012

produced marked P 10. According to the said Gazette (P 10), the Public Service

Commission has decided on the number of vacancies to be filled by the Limited

Competitive Examination-2010. The Learned President’s Counsel appearing for

2 The Limited Competitive Examination-2009 was held in 2012.

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 16 of 28

the Petitioners drew our attention to Paragraph 31C of the affidavit of the 03rd

Respondent which is to the following effect.

The Public Service Commission considered in full the details regarding

the number of vacancies in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service and

concluded that as at 30/06/2010 there were 178 vacancies in Class

II and III of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (which is a combined

service). However, on 01/07/2010, 144 officers were to be promoted

to Class-I of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. Such promotions to

Class-I, would in turn create 144 vacancies in Class II / III of Sri Lanka

Administrative Service. If such vacancies were not filled expeditiously

the inconvenience to the Sri Lanka Administrative Service would be

dire.

Thus, according to the above paragraph, the Public Service Commission had gone

beyond the permitted number of vacancies in Sri Lanka Administrative Service as

at 30/06/2010 of the relevant year as per the Service Minute (P 1), when

calculating the number of vacancies to be filled by the Limited Competitive

Examination-2010.

It is on the above basis, that the Petitioners advanced the argument that similar

approach should have been taken to calculate the number of vacancies to be filled

from the Limited Competitive Examination-2009.

The Petitioners have submitted documentation to establish that the number of

vacancies namely 33, which had been filled from the Limited Competitive

Examination-2009 is less than the number of vacancies calculated according to

the approach taken for the Limited Competitive Examination-2010. According to

the Petitioners, the number of vacancies as per the calculation method adopted

in the Limited Competitive Examination-2010, would add 24 more vacancies to

the 33 vacancies which had been filled by the Limited Competitive Examination

2009. It is on the above basis, that the Petitioners have stated that they have

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 17 of 28

every reason to believe that an additional number of 24 vacancies should have

been filled on the Limited Competitive Examination 2009.3

It is in that backdrop that the Petitioners in their Petition have prayed inter-alia

for,

A) Leave to Proceed under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution in the first

instance;

B) A direction to the Respondents to submit the updated list of vacancies for

the years of 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 in the Sri Lanka Administrative

Service (SLAS) Class III;

C) A direction on the Respondents to submit the marking scheme utilized for

the interviews which were held for the Limited Competitive Examination-

2009 and the relevant mark sheets of the candidates who were interviewed;

D) An interim order restraining/preventing one or more or all of the

Respondents from recruiting officers and or taking any steps to recruit to

the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Class III from the Limited Competitive

Examination held in 2012 until the final determination of this application;

E) Declare that one or more or all the Respondents and/or the State have

infringed the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the Petitioners under

Article 12 (1) of the Constitution;

F) Direct one or more or all the Respondents to appoint the Petitioners to Class

III of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service on the basis of the Limited

Competitive Examination-2009 held in 2011 and back date the said

appointment with effect from 15.12.2010 or such other date as Your

Lordships’ Court deems lawful;

3 Paragraph 48 of the Petition.

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 18 of 28

Out of the six prayers in the Petition, there are only two main final prayers in this

application. They are prayers (E) and (F). All the other prayers are interim prayers

asked for by the Petitioners to facilitate their further collection of the material and

further prosecution of this case. Prayer (E) is a declaration to the effect that the

Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) have been violated.

The prayer (F) seeks a direction on the Respondents to appoint the Petitioners to

Class III of Sri Lanka Administrative Service on the basis of the Limited

Competitive Examination-2009 held in 2011 and back date the said appointment

with effect from 15.12.2010 or such other date as Court would deem lawful.

We observe that the Cabinet of Ministers as per the Cabinet decision produced

marked R 7A had specifically decided the number of vacancies to be filled through

the Limited Competitive Examination-2009. That number is 33 vacancies which

was dully filled subsequent to the Limited Competitive Examination-2009 held as

per the Gazette P 3. The Cabinet decision in R 7A was based on the Cabinet

Memorandum produced marked R 7B submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers by

the Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs. Admittedly, the Public

Service Commission was not functioning at the time the Cabinet of Ministers had

decided on the number of vacancies to be filled through Limited Competitive

Examination-2009 as per R 7A & R 7B. Therefore, in any event, it is not the

Public Service Commission which had made the decision in R 7A. The said

decision was taken by the Cabinet of Ministers. The Public Service Commission

also has nothing to do with the Cabinet Memorandum R 7B as well.

The number of vacancies to be filled through Limited Competitive Examination-

2010 was decided by the Public Service Commission. That was because by that

time the Public Service Commission had been constituted and was functioning.

Thus, in effect the number of vacancies to be filled through the Limited

Competitive Examination-2009 and the number of vacancies to be filled through

the Limited Competitive Examination-2010 have been decided at two different

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 19 of 28

times by two different bodies. i.e., the decision in respect of the Limited

Competitive Examination-2009 was made by the Cabinet of Ministers and the

decision in respect of the Limited Competitive Examination-2010 was made by

the Public Service Commission.

The Petitioners complaint was that the same approach adopted by the Public

Service Commission for the Limited Competitive Examination-2010 should have

been adopted to decide the number of vacancies to be filled through the Limited

Competitive Examination-2009.

Invariably this is in effect an argument that the Cabinet of Ministers also should

have followed the same approach taken by the Public Service Commission at the

Limited Competitive Examination-2010 when they (the Cabinet of Ministers)

decided on the number of vacancies to be filled through the Limited Competitive

Examination-2009. (in their decision as per R 7A & R 7B).

Thus, it is clear that the argument advanced by the Petitioners is directed to

challenge the decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers as per R 7A which was

based on the Cabinet Memorandum R 7B. This is because, if at all, it is the

Cabinet of Ministers who should have considered such an approach when they

made their decision regarding the number of vacancies to be filled through the

Limited Competitive Examination-2009 which is set out in R 7A & R 7B.

Moreover, in any case, the Public Service Commisssion was not functioning and

was not a party to that decision in R 7A & R 7B. Indeed, the Public Service

Commisssion has nothing to do with either the Cabinet Decision R 7A or the

Cabinet Memorandum R 7B. It was in that backdrop that the learned Deputy

Solicitor General drew the attention of Court to the fact that the Petitioners have

failed to name the Cabinet of Ministers as Respondents to this Petition despite

the fact that they are necessary parties in this case as it is their decision that is

being challenged in this case.

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 20 of 28

It is true that the Petitioners have not made the Cabinet of Ministers as

Respondents to this application. As has already been mentioned above, it is also

true that it is the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers that is being challenged in

this case. This is because the Petitioners’ position is that the decision to fill only

33 vacancies through the Limited Competitive Examination-2009 is unlawful and

hence has violated their fundamental right guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the

Constitution. Who has made that decision? It is the Cabinet of Ministers. Thus,

in our view, there is merit in the above submission made by the learned Deputy

Solicitor General. It is clear that the Cabinet of Ministers have not been made

parties to this application.

Furthermore, Part IV of the Supreme Court Rules would apply in respect of filing

of fundamental rights applications under Article 126 of the Constitution. In terms

of Rule 44 (1)(a), such Petition shall contain the circumstances and particulars of

the ‘executive and administrative action’ by which the fundamental rights of the

Petitioners have been or are about to be infringed. The facts and circumstances

relating to such infringement must be clearly and distinctly set out in their

petition.

As per Rule 44(1)(b), such Petitioner must name as Respondents not only the

Attorney General but also the person or persons who have infringed their

fundamental rights. Although in this case the allegation of the infringement of the

Petitioners fundamental rights is by a decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers

the Petitioners have failed to name the Cabinet of Ministers as respondents to this

application as required under Rule 44(1)(b).

Furthermore, the Petitioners have not prayed that the said Cabinet decisions R

7A be quashed. The Petitioners have merely prayed for a direction on the

Respondents to appoint the Petitioners to Class-III of Sri Lanka Administrative

Service on the basis of the Limited Competitive Examination in 2009.

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 21 of 28

The Petitioners also have prayed for an alternative relief to direct the Respondents

to fill 24 further vacancies (relying on the method by which the number of

vacancies were calculated for the Limited Competitive Examination-2010) to

Class-III of Sri Lanka Administrative Service on the basis of the Limited

Competitive Examination-2009.

As has been already mentioned above, following the Limited Competitive

Examination-2009, the number of vacancies (33) have been filled according to the

decision made by the Cabinet of Ministers which is R 7A. The notice for calling

for applications for the Limited Competitive Examination-2009 has been

published by the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs.

It is not a notice published by the Public Service Commission. (Public Service

Commission was not even functioning at that time). The Cabinet of Ministers had

decided to fill number of vacancies (33) on 19-05-2010. We observe that the

Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs had clearly stated

at the end of the Gazette (P 3) that he had published this Gazette as per the

direction by the Cabinet of Ministers. Thus, it was pursuant to that decision in R

7A, that the Secretary, Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs had

published the Gazette (P 3) dated 09-07-2010 in order to take steps to call for the

applications to fill those 33 vacancies.

Thus, as far as the filing of 33 vacancies from the Limited Competitive

Examination-2009 is concerned, it was the Cabinet of Ministers which had

decided that only 33 vacancies must be filled by the Limited Competitive

Examination-2009. As has already been mentioned above, the Petitioners do not

seek to quash the Cabinet decision in R 7A. We observe that if R 7A is quashed

the Petitioners have no leg to stand in this instance as none of them can be

considered for any appointment as it is on R 7A that they too had applied to sit

for the Limited Competitive Examination-2009. In those circumstances, we are

unable to see how we can direct the Respondents to appoint another set of 24

candidates who had sat for the same examination in 2009 without quashing the

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 22 of 28

afore-stated restriction in the Cabinet decision R 7A. There is no legal basis to

take such a course of action.

The learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners also drew the attention of

Court to pages 9A and 10A of the Gazette No. 1419/3 dated 14/11/2005 (P 1) at

which it is stated that the Public Service Commission will decide the number of

appointments to be made at one occasion. He sought to argue that according to

the said clause the Public Service Commission has been empowered to decide the

number of appointments to be made at one occasion. However, as pointed out by

the learned Deputy Solicitor General, we take the view that this clause is not a

reference to any power to decide the number of vacancies to be filled through any

examination, but only a reference to the number of persons who may be given

appointments after finishing the relevant recruitment process in a given year.

Therefore, in our view those clauses would not help the Petitioners.

We also note the paragraph 31D of the affidavit filed by the 3rd Respondent, dated

22-03-2013 which states as follows:

“as such by letter dated 30-09-2011 as a one-off deviation from the Service

Minute, the PSC permitted the said 144 vacancies arising one day after 30-

06-2010 to be added to the 178 vacancies existing as at 30-06-2010. Of the

322 such vacancies 258 were permitted to be filled through the open

competitive examination.”

The same view is also reflected in the document dated 30-09-2011 produced

marked R 10 which is the decision made by the Public Service Commission on

the number of vacancies to be filled by the Limited Competitive Examination-

2010.

R 10 states that the real number of vacancies to be filled through the Limited

competitive examination-2010 must be taken as the number of vacancies existed

at 30th June. However, it was because 144 Class II officers had been promoted to

Class I with effect from 01-07-2010, another 144 vacancies had been added to

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 23 of 28

the number of vacancies existed as at 30th June of that year. That was how the

322 vacancies in Class III was calculated for the Limited competitive examination-

2010. The Public Service Commission as per R 10 having considered that aspect

had approved to fill 258 vacancies in that year. The Public Service Commission

had done this ‘as a one-off deviation from the service minute’. This could be seen

from the two following paragraphs quoted respectively from R 10 and R 08.

The following paragraph is quoted from the document dated 30-09-2011

produced marked R 10 which is the decision made by the Public Service

Commission on the number of vacancies to be filled by the Limited Competitive

Examination-2010.

“03. ශ්‍රී ලංකා පරිපාලන සේවා වයවේථාව අනුව ශ්‍රී.ලං.ප.සේ. III පන්තියට

The portions highlighted would clearly show that the decision made by the Public

Service Commission on the number of vacancies to be filled by the Limited

Competitive Examination-2010 is ‘a one-off deviation from the service minute’.

That becomes further clear from the following paragraph quoted from the letter

dated 22-08-2011 which has been produced marked R 08. Indeed, that is the

letter referred to as “…ඔසේ සමාංක හා 2011.08.22 දිනැි ලිපිසේ සෙවන සේෙසේ

සෙහන්ත කරුණුෙ …” in the above paragraph quoted from R10. Contents of the

second paragraph of R 08 is as follows.

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 24 of 28

“එසහත් රජ්‍සේ විශ්‍රාමික නිලධාරීන්ත නැවත සේවසේ සනාසයෙවීමට

ප්‍රිපත්ිමය තීරණයක් සගන ඇි බැවින්ත පළාත් සභාවල පුරප්පාඩු පිරවීසම්ප

Thus, it could be seen from the above paragraph in R 08 that there was some

exigency prevailed at that time.

The above facts would show that the Cabinet of Ministers by R 7A and R 7B had

not deviated from the normal practice of calculating the vacancies according to

the Service Minute (P 1). However, R 10 shows that the Public Service

Commission had deviated from the accepted general lawful practice of calculating

the vacancies as at 30th June of the relevant year. Thus, if at all, if there is a

violation of law, it must be in the decision made by the Public Service Commission

as per R 10 which has violated the accepted normal lawful practice of calculating

the number of vacancies for a given year as per the Service Minute (P 1).

Moreover, that decision has only been made applicable to that year. Whether that

is correct or wrong or permissible is another matter. In the instant application the

Petitioners had neither challenged nor prayed to quash that decision. To the

contrary, they seek to rely on that decision which is not strictly as per the law.

Another important thing we observe in this application is that the Petitioners have

failed to rely on a particular legal basis to agitate that the Respondents should

have filled 24 more vacancies than the 33 number of vacancies which had lawfully

existed as at 30th June of that year. As has been mentioned above, the sole basis

upon which the Petitioners appear to agitate for their claim is the fact that the

Respondents had adopted a different method outside the method specified by law

to calculate the number of vacancies to be filled through the Limited Competitive

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 25 of 28

Examination-2010. The Petitioners have not averred that they had a legitimate

expectation. The Petitioners were content by mere stating in paragraph 48 of the

Petition that they have every reason to believe that an additional number of 24

vacancies should have been filled on the Limited Competitive Examination 2009.

As the Limited Competitive Examination-2009 had preceded the Limited

Competitive Examination-2010, the Petitioners would not have known that the

Respondents would calculate the number of vacancies in a different way in the

following year. Thus, leave alone legitimate expectation, the Petitioners could not

have had any expectation of that nature when they applied and sat for the Limited

Competitive Examination-2009. Therefore, it is not open for the Petitioners to

advance a case on legitimate expectation (The Petitioners have not averred such

ground specifically).

As has already been mentioned above, the method of calculation of the number

of vacancies to be filled through the Limited Competitive Examination-2010 is

outside the method set out in P 1 and that decision does not conform to the

published service minute. If the Petitioners had challenged the calculation of the

number of vacancies to be filled through the Limited Competitive Examination-

2010 it is then altogether a different scenario. As they had not, we are not called

upon to consider the legality of the calculation of the number of vacancies to be

filled through the Limited Competitive Examination-2010. Suffice to say that one

wrong would not make the second wrong legal. Therefore, in our view, the

Petitioners are not entitled to claim that the same deviation should have been

done to calculate the number of vacancies to be filled through the Limited

Competitive Examination-2009 also. That is to say that the Petitioners wished

that the Cabinet of Ministers also should have ignored the provisions in the

Service Minute P 1. In effect what the Petitioners are trying to do is not to uphold

the law i.e., not to conform to the published service minute, but to blatantly go

outside it. Then why should the published service minute there for?

On the other hand, as per paragraph 31D of the affidavit filed by the 3rd

Respondent dated 22-03-2013, the decision set out in the letter dated 30-09-2011

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 26 of 28

produced marked R 10, it is clear that the deviated method of calculation of

number of vacancies was limited only to that year ‘as a one-off deviation from the

service minute’ for whatever the exigency that may have prevailed at that time. As

has already been mentioned above, we would not engage ourselves to consider

the legality of the said ‘one-off deviation’.

This court by its order dated 04-10-2012, had granted leave to proceed to the

Petitioners in respect of the alleged violations of their Fundamental Rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Thus, the question arises as

to what law the Respondents had violated when they adopted the published

method to calculate the number of vacancies existed as at 30th June of the

relevant year. There is absolutely none.

Then, what is the legal basis for this Court to hold that any Respondent in this

case has infringed the Petitioners’ Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article

12(1) of the Constitution? We cannot see any such basis whatsoever.

For the forgoing reasons, we hold that the Petitioners have not made out a case

of any infringement of any fundamental right guaranteed under Article 12(1) of

the Constitution. The Petitioners are therefore not entitled to succeed with this

petition. We decide to dismiss this Petition but without costs.

Mr. Manohara De Silva, PC appearing for the Intervenient Respondents, in the

course of his submissions drew the attention of Court to the fact that the

Intervenient Respondents are a set of candidates who had not sat for the Limited

Competitive Examination-2009 which is relevant to the case advanced by the

Petitioners, but a set of candidates who had only sat for the Limited Competitive

Examination-2010. Mr. Manohara De Silva, PC submitted that despite that fact

his clients have also been prevented from being appointed to Class-III of Sri Lanka

Administrative Service due to the presence of the interim order which had been

granted by Court on 03/07/2013.

[ SC FR 479/2012] - Page 27 of 28

Both the learned President’s Counsel for the Petitioners as well as the learned

President’s Counsel for the Intervenient Respondents admitted that they are not

rivals to each other.

Petitioners in this application have neither challenged Limited Competitive

Examination-2010 nor challenged the calculation of number of vacancies to be

filled through that examination (2010).

As pointed out by Mr. Manohara De Silva PC, we observe that the Interim Order

which had been granted by Court on 03/07/2013 was to restrain/prevent

Respondents from recruiting officers and or taking any steps to recruit to the Sri

Lanka Administrative Service Class-III from the Limited Competitive Examination

held in 2012 until the final determination of this application. Therefore, out of an

abundance of caution, we direct that the interim order granted by this Court on

03/07/2013 must no longer have any effect.

The Petition is dismissed without costs.
