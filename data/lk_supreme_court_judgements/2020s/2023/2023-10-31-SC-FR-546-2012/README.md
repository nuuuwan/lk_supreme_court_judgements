The Petitioner namely, Captain Ambawalage Dammika Senaratne De Silva

(hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) served in the rank of Captain in the Sri Lanka

Army attached to the 20th Sri Lanka Light Infantry. The Petitioner has made the instant

application seeking relief in respect of the infringement of his Fundamental Rights

guaranteed under and in terms of the Constitution, in the manner hereinafter more

fully set out, against the Respondents.

The 1st Respondent is the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army. The 2nd

Respondent was the Commanding Officer of the Alampil Army Camp (Nandikadal)

where the Petitioner served at the time the alleged incident took place. The 3rd

Respondent is the Centre Commandant of the Regimental Headquarters of the 20th Sri

Lanka Light Infantry. The 4th Respondent is the Chairman of the Court of Inquiry held

against the Petitioner as described below, while the 5th and 6th Respondents are

members of the said Court of Inquiry. The 7th Respondent is the officer who conducted

the investigation against the Petitioner at the Sri Lanka Military Police Headquarters.

The 8th Respondent is the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and the 9th Respondent

is the Secretary to His Excellency the President. The 10th Respondent is the Hon.

Attorney General who has been made a party to this application in compliance with

the law.

The Petitioners instituted this action under Article 126 of the Constitution,

through Petition dated 14th September 2012 against the 1st-10th Respondents claiming

that the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner as guaranteed by Articles 12(1), 13(3),

13(5) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been infringed by the Respondents and

further requesting to quash the recommendation of the 1st Respondent to withdraw

the commission of the Petitioner from the rank of Captain of the Sri Lanka Army.

This matter was supported before this court on 24th October 2012 and the Court

was inclined to grant Leave to Proceed for the alleged violations of Article 12(1) and

Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 24

I find it pertinent to refer to the factual matrix of this application as enumerated

by the parties in order to ascertain whether the Petitioners Fundamental Rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution have been violated by

the 1st-10th Respondents. However, as there are substantial disparities between the

narration of facts provided by the parties, I find it necessary to narrate both positions.

The Facts as recounted by the Petitioner

The Petitioner asserts that on 5th December 1990, he joined the Sri Lanka Army

as a solider. As claimed by the Petitioner, due to his exemplary performance in the said

operations he was enlisted as a Cadet Officer and upon completion of a training course

at the Diyathalawa Army Camp he was commissioned in the rank of 2nd Lieutenant on

13th October 1997 and was attached to the 20th Sri Lanka Infantry of the Sri Lanka

Army. Following this, the Petitioner was promoted as a Lieutenant on 13th April 2001

and as a Captain on 2nd August 2004 and has served in several operational areas of the

country continuously for a period of 19 years, participating in various operations.

As per the Petitioner, in January 2009 he was appointed as the Officer

Commanding of one of the companies of the 20th Light Infantry, namely Alfa Company,

while the 2nd Respondent was the Commanding Officer. It was the position of the

Petitioner that during his period of service in the said Company, differences of opinion

arose between the Petitioner and the 2nd Respondent with regard to military strategies

adopted by the 2nd Respondent. This had resulted in heavy losses both to soldiers and

material and as a result the 2nd Respondent had harboured an animosity towards the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner states that while the Petitioner was serving as the Officer

Commanding of the aforesaid Company of the 20th Light Infantry, on 22nd April 2009,

a soldier named Saman Kumara died from gunshot injuries at the Nandikadal Army

Camp area which gunshots were fired from the said Saman Kumara's own weapon.

Further the Petitioner states that at the time of his death, said Saman Kumara was

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 24

serving in a different company to that of the company where the Petitioner was the

Officer Commanding.

As claimed by the Petitioner, with the report of the said gunshots, on the

directions of the 2nd Respondent and one Major Weerakoon, the Petitioner searched

the area and discovered Saman Kumara (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

deceased) fallen in the jungle with gunshot injuries 300 meters away from where the

Petitioner stood. Following which, the Petitioner had dispatched Saman Kumara to

the Camp upon instructions, and after informing, the 2nd Respondent. Thereafter, the

Petitioner came to know that Saman Kumara had succumbed to his injuries.

It is the position of the Petitioner that on or about 31st May 2009, while he was

serving in the aforementioned Company, the Petitioner was directed by the 2nd

Respondent to take the body of a deceased soldier named Silva to the Vavuniya Army

Camp. As soon as the Petitioner had left the Army Camp the 2nd Respondent had

relieved him of his duties as the Commanding Officer of the Alfa Company and

replaced him with a much junior officer without a valid reason.

According to the Petitioner, his belongings had been removed and kept under

the custody of the 2nd Respondent. Upon the request of the Petitioner, due to the

adverse environment created at the army camp, he was permitted to report back to

the Regimental Headquarters, Panagoda.

According to the Petitioner, on 9th June 2009 he had come home and had

reported back to the Regimental Headquarters on 10th June 2009. However, on or

about 12th June 2009, the Petitioner returned home on medical advice to rest, as he

was suffering from an eye infection and soon after reported back to Headquarters on

the 14th June 2009. Subsequently, the Petitioner was informed by the then Regimental

Centre Commandant that there was an anonymous petition made against him and he

was detained in a cell in the said Camp.

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 24

As asserted by the Petitioner, on 16th June 2009, the Petitioner was brought to

the Sri Lanka Military Police Headquarters on the allegation that he had committed

the murder of aforementioned Soldier Saman Kumara. Moreover, on 17th June 2009

around 9.45 am, the Petitioner was handed over to the 7th Respondent who carried

out the investigation against the Petitioner. The Petitioner further contends that, the

officers attached to the Sri Lanka Military Police, including the 7th Respondent

threatened to shoot the Petitioner if he fails to tell the truth. Additionally, the Petitioner

alleges that the 7th Respondent had brutally assaulted and threatened to kill him in an

attempt to obtain a forcible confession to the effect that the Petitioner had shot the

said Saman Kumara.

Consequent to the above, the Petitioner was kept under the custody of the 7th

Respondent and was denied any visits by his family members despite their continuous

requests. As a result, the Petitioners mother wrote a complaint (marked P1) to His

Excellency the President regarding the manner in which the purported investigation

was being conducted against the Petitioner. Additionally, she lodged a complaint to

the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka bearing no. HRC 2855/09 dated 3rd July

2009 (marked P2a) regarding the same. Subsequently, on 7th July 2009, the officers

attached to the Human Rights Commission telephoned the 7th Respondent and

requested him to allow the family members of the Petitioner to visit him, to which the

7th Respondent agreed to comply with. Accordingly, the Petitioner was allowed to meet

his family for the first time on 7th July 2009 after 23 days of arrest.

The Petitioner states that, his aide Dilum Sanjeewa, had also been detained by

the Military Police and had been forced to give a statement to the effect that he had

shot the deceased on the direction of the Petitioner. Petitioner contends that this

statement was given by the said Dilum Sanjeewa under the influence of the officers

attached to the Military Police, the 2nd Respondent and the 7th Respondent.

The Petitioner states that the investigation conducted against him was illegal as

he was subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment by the Military

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 24

Police. Therefore, the Petitioners Attorney at Law Ms. Niluka Dissanayake had filed a

Fundamental Rights Application bearing No. SC/FR/556/2009 on behalf of the

Petitioner, against the 7th Respondent, 2nd Respondent, Commanding Officer of the Sri

Lanka Military Police and several other responsible officers on the alleged infringement

of the violation of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner as guaranteed by Articles

11, 12(1), 13(1), 13(2), and 13(3) of the Constitution.

As enumerated by the Petitioner, on 6th August 2009 around 10.30 am, he was

handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department with the aforesaid Dilum

Sanjeewa. Following which, on 7th August 2009, the Petitioner was produced before

the learned Magistrate of Aunradhapura under B report bearing No. B/1228/09 on the

allegation that, the Petitioner and the said Dilum Sanjeewa committed the murder of

the deceased, an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code. Eventually,

the Petitioner was remanded.

Consequently, on 18th January 2010, the Petitioners mother filed a Bail

Application bearing No. HCBA 125/2009 on behalf of the Petitioner in the Provincial

High Court of Anuradhapura. On consideration of the said bail application, the learned

High Court Judge had released the Petitioner on bail. Upon being enlarged on bail,

the Petitioner had reported back to the Regimental Headquarters. Accordingly, on 18th

March 2010, the Petitioner had received a message (marked P14) that he was

interdicted with effect from 18th March 2010.

As per the Petitioner, while he was detained in the Sri Lanka Military Police

Headquarters, he was questioned by the officers on allegations of sexual assault

against the deceased in reference to a letter addressed to the 2nd Respondent by the

deceased (marked P15), which alleged that the Petitioner had sexually abused the

deceased on 15th April 2009. As revealed from investigations, the deceased had been

subject to sexual harassment by the Petitioner on 14th April 2009. Accordingly, the said

deceased had given a statement to the 2nd Respondent confirming the said sexual

harassment, following which the 2nd Respondent had reprimanded the Petitioner on

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 11 of 24

18th April 2009. However, it is the position of the Petitioner that the said allegation was

a fabrication of the 2nd Respondent or was obtained under duress.

Challenging the purported statement of the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioner

asserts that he was in the Anuradhapura Military Hospital from 17th to 18th April 2009

in order to obtain his medical reports (marked P16) for his next promotion to the rank

of Major. Therefore, he had reported back to the Camp only on the 19th April 2009.

The Petitioner further states that if such a complaint had been made against him on

an allegation of sexual harassment, the 2nd Respondent should have taken steps

according to the Military Law rather than merely issuing a warning. As such the

Petitioner questions the credibility of the 2nd Respondents statement.

The Petitioner states that the non-summary inquiry in respect of the alleged

murder of the said Saman Kumara commenced in the case bearing No. 29204.

However, on 24th April 2012, the said Dilum Sanjeewa whom the prosecution claimed

to be the assassin of the deceased, was discharged from the proceedings on the

instructions of the Hon. Attorney General. While the Petitioner was held in custody of

the Military Police, he became aware that there was a Court of Inquiry held against him

and his aide Dilum Sanjeewa. Dilum Sanjeewa had informed the Petitioner that he gave

a statement at the said inquiry, however, the Petitioner is of the position that no such

statement was recorded nor was he summoned before a Court of Inquiry. Therefore,

the Petitioner had no knowledge of the said Court of Inquiry held whilst they were in

custody.

Subsequently, the Petitioner discovered that the 1st Respondent had convened

a Court of Inquiry and the 4th Respondent was appointed the Chairman, whilst the 5th

and 6th Respondents were appointed members to the said Court of Inquiry.

Accordingly, by letter dated 18th August 2011 (marked P18), the Petitioner was

informed by the Centre Commandant of the 20th Light Infantry, that the said Court of

Inquiry was scheduled to be held on the 8th September 2011 and the Petitioner was

instructed to be present.

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 24

At the said Court of Inquiry, the Petitioner had given a written statement

(marked P-18a). Furthermore, as per the Petitioner, the statement given by his aide

Dilum Sanjeewa (marked P-18b) was in total contradiction with his previous statements

given to the Court of Inquiry and/or the Military Police and/or the Criminal

Investigation Department.

Moreover, the Petitioner claims that he was not given an opportunity to cross

examine any of the witnesses and his signature was never obtained to the proceedings

of the Court of Inquiry except to the statement made by him. Additionally, the eye

witnesses to the alleged incident categorically stated that the Petitioner had no

involvement to the said incident. The Petitioner further states that the persons who

have been named as witnesses had testified before the Court of Inquiry in his absence

and therefore, the 4th, 5th and 6th Respondents have acted contrary to the army

Regulations in relation to Court of Inquiry and claims that it is a violation of the

principles of Natural Justice.

Upon the conclusion of the said Court of Inquiry, its members had submitted

their findings to the 1st Respondent for his determination and recommendation.

Despite the Petitioners requests for a copy of the said findings and convening order

of the 1st Respondent, he has not been furnished a copy up to date. Further, the

Petitioner states that at the said Court of Inquiry, he was not questioned about the

alleged sexual assault against the deceased.

The Petitioner states that on or about the 7th September he was informed by

his Regimental Headquarters that, after submitting the findings of the Court of Inquiry,

the 1st Respondent had decided to discharge him from his service in the Sri Lanka Army

and to withdraw his rank of Captain. The said recommendation had been sent to His

Excellency the President for the purpose of withdrawing the commission of the

Petitioner.

It is the position of the Petitioner that, as per the Army Courts of Inquiry

Regulations 1952, punishments cannot be imposed on a Respondent Officer upon

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 24

findings of a Court of Inquiry. In terms of Section 2 of the said Regulations, it is only

convened to collect and record evidence, hence it cannot be equated to a trial.

Therefore, the Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent has no authority to discharge

the Petitioner by recommending a withdrawal of his commission, without having

recourse to a Court Martial in terms of law. Accordingly, the Petitioner believes that

the said decision of the 1st Respondent is arbitrary, capricious, ultra vires, unlawful,

illegal and has no force in law, as the Court of Inquiry was held contrary to the

procedure set out in the Army Court of Inquiry Regulations.

Based on the above submissions, the Petitioner claims that his Fundamental

Rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1), 13(3), 13(5) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution

have been violated.

Variations in facts as per the Respondents

It is the position of the 1st and 2nd Respondents that, on 22nd April 2009 around

6.45 pm, a soldier named Lance Corporal Saman Kumara was found dead with gunshot

injuries, which was initially treated as an accidental discharge of his own weapon.

However, prior to his death, the deceased had complained to his superior officers that

the Petitioner had sexually assaulted him, and upon the request of the 2nd Respondent,

the deceased made a complaint in writing. Following which, his Commanding Officer

had taken steps to remove him from the Petitioners command and assign him to the

Headquarters Camp.

Therefore, suspicion had arisen as to whether the Petitioner was involved in the

shooting of the deceased and by June 2009, sufficient evidence had surfaced with

regard to his involvement, as a result of which, the Petitioner was arrested.

Furthermore, the 1st Respondent states that, in terms of Regulation 3(7)(a) of

the Army Court of Inquiry Regulation 1952, in an event where a member of the Army

dies, it is mandatory to appoint a Court of Inquiry to determine the cause of death.

Accordingly, a Court of Inquiry was convened and in the said Inquiry, the Petitioners

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 24

aide Dilum Sanjeewa testified that on the night of 14th April 2009 around 11.30 pm,

the Petitioner had forced the deceased to massage his legs, following which the

deceased had deserted the camp on 16th April 2009. Moreover, as alleged by the said

Dilum Sanjeewa, on 22nd April 2009 around 6.30 pm he had seen the Petitioner

shooting the deceased. Consequent to that, at around 9:00 pm, the petitioner asked

and threatened Dilum not to tell anyone about the incident, and the petitioner said

that if he did, he and the entire family would be killed with the help of the underworld

(As per the document marked R3- the testimony given by the Dilum Sanjeewa on

16/6/2009 before Army Court of Inquiry).

As asserted by the 7th Respondent, on 17th June 2009, the Provost Marshal had

submitted to him an anonymous letter that was received by the Army Commander,

regarding the death of the said Saman Kumara. As per the contents of the letter, the

Petitioner was accused of being responsible for the death of the said Saman Kumara.

Accordingly, the 7th Respondent initiated a Military Police investigation and arrested

the Petitioner. Furthermore, the 7th Respondent denies all allegations made by the

Petitioner against him, with regard to him assaulting the Petitioner and treating him

arbitrarily and illegally whilst in the custody of the Military Police.

With regards to the Court of Inquiry, the 1st Respondent states that, it is an

internal inquiry held to determine whether an officer is fit to hold his office when

criminal charges are preferred against him in a court of law. A pending criminal case

in a court of law is not a bar to the conduct of an inquiry with regard to the Petitioners

acts of misconduct. Therefore, the second Court of Inquiry was convened for this

purpose. At the said inquiry, the Petitioner was given an opportunity to respond to the

allegations against him, he had testified under oath and denied any knowledge of the

incident and further stated that his statement to the Military Police was obtained under

duress. Having considered the reports of the said two Courts of Inquiries, the 1st

Respondent came to the conclusion that the retention of the Petitioner was not

desirable for the maintenance of good order and discipline in the Army, hence decided

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 15 of 24

to recommend to His Excellency the President to withdraw the commission of the

Petitioner.

Validity of the decision to discharge the Petitioner from the Army and to

withdraw his commission

In deciding upon the merits of this case, I find it pertinent to examine the matter

of contention claimed by the Petitioner that the actions of the Respondents are in

violation of Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Article 12(1) reads as follows:

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal

protection of the law.

Article 14(1)(g) reads as follows:

The freedom to engage by himself or in association with others in any

lawful occupation, profession, trade, business or enterprise.

In the instant case, a Petition had been submitted to the Commander of the

Army on 17th May 2009 by the 20th Battalion of the Sri Lanka Light Infantry where the

deceased was served requesting the Commander to carry out justice to their deceased

brother (deceased Lance Corporeal Saman Kumara) who succumbed to the gunshot

injuries on 22nd April 2009.

In terms of Regulation 3(7)(a) of the Army Courts of Inquiry Regulation 1952,

where a member of the Army dies, it is mandatory to appoint a Court of Inquiry to

ascertain the cause of the death and to determine whether the death is duty related

or not. Accordingly, a Court of Inquiry was convened to investigate to the

circumstances leading to the said soldiers death.

However, it is the position of the Petitioner that he was not informed that a

Court of Inquiry had commenced against him and was only made aware of it when his

aide Dilum Sanjeewa had informed him that a statement was recorded from him at the

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 16 of 24

said Inquiry. He further alleges that he was not allowed to cross examine the witnesses

that testified before the Court of Inquiry. The Petitioner alleges that several other

witnesses who have given adverse evidence against the Petitioner had testified in the

absence of the Petitioner. The Petitioner submits that it is a violation of fundamental

principles of natural justice, which should be followed in such kind of inquiries and

Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution of Democratic Socialist Republic

of Sri Lanka.

With regard to the Court of Inquiry, the 1st Respondent states that, it is an

internal inquiry held to determine whether an officer is fit to hold his office when

criminal charges are preferred against him in a court of law. The second Court of

Inquiry was convened for the purpose of determining the criminal liability of the

Accused. At the said second inquiry, the Petitioner was given an opportunity to

respond to the allegations against him, he had testified under oath and denied any

knowledge of the incident and further stated that his statement to the Military Police

was obtained under duress. In Y.B.A.M. Premakumara vs Army Commander and

others (CA WRIT/1153/2006 CA minutes dated 29/10/2009), discussed about the

difference between a Court of inquiry and Disciplinary Inquiry which reads as follows,

A Court of Inquiry is different from a disciplinary inquiry. In a disciplinary inquiry

a charge sheet will be served and the person accused will have an opportunity to

answer the charges and defend himself. In a Court of Inquiry there is no accused

or charge sheet, all those who appear before the Court of Inquiry are witnesses as

it is a fact finding inquiry.

As such, whether the opportunity of cross examination was given or denied will not

change the character of the Court of Inquiry as it is a fact finding inquiry conducted to

unveil the surrounding facts and circumstances. Hence, I am of the view that the

Petitioner was given a fair hearing and the Principles of natural justice was followed as

the Petitioner has no contentions against the conduct of the disciplinary inquiry.

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 17 of 24

As per the evidence adduced by the witnesses before the Court of Inquiry it is

revealed that the deceased who initially belonged to the Alfa Company had been

transferred to the Delta Company after the allegation was made that he was sexually

assaulted by the Petitioner, who at the time functioned as a Commanding Officer of

the Alfa Company. The written statement of the deceased explaining the said sexual

assault is marked 2R1. Following this complaint, the deceased was relocated in the

Southern part of the defence line and he was found shot dead on 22nd April 2009

enroute towards the South of the line of defence.

The Petitioner was arrested for the death of the deceased. Petitioner alleges

that he was seriously physically assaulted whilst in the custody of Military Police. On

the date of his release from the Military Police he had been produced for a physical

examination at the Institute of Legal Medicine and Toxicology in Colombo where the

medical practitioner who examined him stated the following in the Medico-Legal

Examination Report dated 21st August 2009 (Marked RX10).

According to the details given by the examinee he had been kept in a cell.

He had been assaulted on several occasions with a wooden club and hand.

He has experienced pain in the mouth and there had been bleeding from

the mouth.

General conditions He was conscious and rational and talked freely, no

physical deformities detected.

External examination Examination of the mouth did not reveal damaged

teeth or mucosal injuries.

Opinion: 1. The examinee was conscious and rational and was in good

physical and mental state

2. No injuries or scars related to the present incident detected

during the examination.

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 18 of 24

Therefore, as divulged above, no signs of physical injury are evident, hence, the

Petitioners claim of physical assault cannot be considered before this court.

The initial Court of Inquiry was convened on 16th June 2009 (marked 2R2).

According to the evidence adduced by Staff Sergeant Premathilaka (1st Witness), the

deceased was on movement with one Private Soldier named Rukmal, towards the

Southern area of the defence line where the Delta Company was to be relocated. The

route of relocation was passing through the front headquarters of the Alfa Company.

As per the evidence adduced by Private Soldier Rukmal (4th Witness), while

passing the front headquarters of the Alfa Company, the Petitioner officer had inquired

from him about the deceased, who then had met him. The relevant portion of evidence

testified by the 4th witness is quoted below.

The unofficial English translation of the above is as follows:

Q05:- What did Captain Silva say after you said so?

A05:- He asked me to call Lance Corporal Saman Kumara. Thereafter, I

called out to Lance Corporal Saman Kumara and told him that Captain

Silva was looking for him.

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 19 of 24

Q06:- Did you see Lance Corporal Saman Kumara come towards Captain

Silva?

A06:- Yes, he (Saman Kumara) passed me because he (the Captain) was in

front of me.

Q08:- When you were coming past that company, was there anyone near

Captain Silva?

A08:- No, it was only Captain Silva.

Q11:- Do you know the place where Lance Corporal Saman Kumara was

shot?

A11:- Its the place where he left the box and came when Captain Silva

called for him.

The question arises as to who fired the two gunshots which caused the death

of Lance Corporal Saman Kumara. As revealed in the evidence that transpired before

the Court of Inquiry, there was no terror attack in close proximity of the incident of

death on that particular day. The cause of death was revealed to be two gunshots fired

at a close range. Hence, the death cannot be as a result of an attempt of suicide as the

deceased could not have fired two shots at himself.

With the above reasoning together with the testimony of the 4th witness, a

reasonable inference could be drawn that the Petitioner officer with the support of his

aide Dilum Sanjeewa would have shot at Lance Corporal Saman Kumara, from the

anger instigated when the deceased had complained of and reported the sexual

assault caused to him, to the superior officers of the Petitioners Regiment.

In terms of Regulation 3(7)(a) of the Army Courts of Inquiry Regulation 1952,

where a member of the Army dies, it is mandatory to appoint a Court of Inquiry to

ascertain the cause of the death and to determine whether the death is duty related

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 20 of 24

or not. A Court of inquiry as laid down in Regulation 2 of The Army Courts of Inquiry

Regulations 1952 means:

an assembly of officers or, of one or more officers together with one or

more warrant or non-commissioned officers, directed to collect and record

evidence and, if so required, to report or make a decision with regard to

any matter or thing which may be referred to them for inquiry under this

regulation.

Accordingly, a Court of Inquiry was convened to investigate the circumstances

leading to the death of Lance Corporal Saman Kumara. At the said Court of Inquiry,

the Petitioners aide Dilum Sanjeewa had testified that on 22nd April 2009 around 6.30

pm he had seen the Petitioner shooting the deceased and therefore he was threatened

to be killed, if he divulged the said incident.

Having considered the reports of the two Courts of Inquiry, the Army

Commander came to the conclusion that the retention of the Petitioner was not

desirable for the maintenance of good order and discipline (which is mandatory in the

military), in the Army and hence declared to recommend to His Excellency the

President to withdraw the commission of the Petitioner. The Respondents further

submit that, the Petitioner has not sought for a relief to quash the findings of the two

Courts of Inquiry.

However, the question arises as to whether the Commander of the Army is

authorised upon the findings of the Court of Inquiry to make recommendations

seeking the discharge and withdrawal of commission of the Petitioner officer. In terms

of Regulation 2 of the Army Disciplinary Regulation 1950 read with Section 8 of the

Army Act No. 17 of 1949, the Commander of the Army is vested with the responsibility

of maintaining discipline in the Army and has a paramount public duty to ensure that

the soldiers are commanded by fit and proper officers. Furthermore, in terms of

Regulation 2 of the Army Officer Service Regulations (Regular Force) 1992 the

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 21 of 24

Commander of the Army is authorised to forward recommendations to the Minister of

Defence for the approval of His Excellency the President.

As per Justice Vijith K. Malagoda PC, in the case of Major K.D.S. Weerasinghe

vs Colonel G.K.B. Dissanyake and others (SC minutes dated 31.10.2017)

the Commander of the Army shall be vested with general responsibility

for discipline in the Army and in the case in hand the Commander acting

under the above position had sought a direction from His Excellency the

President regarding the further retention of Petitioner. As revealed before

us, the above conduct of the Commander of the army when seeking a

directive from His Excellency the President was an independent act and

was done for the best interest of the Army, in order to maintain the

discipline of the Army.

This is further supported by the Extraordinary Gazette bearing No. 780/7-1993

dated 17th August 1993 which reads as follows:

38. In forwarding an application from an officer to retire or resign his

commission, a commanding officer shall, when such application, is the

result of misconduct or anything affecting the officers honour or character

as gentleman, state all circumstances and particulars of the case, the

Commander of the Army shall ensure that the statement contains a

complete account of the case before forwarding it to the Secretary.

39. An officer may be called upon to retire or resign his commission for

misconduct or in any circumstances which in the opinion of the President,

require such action. An officer so called upon to retire or to resign his

commission may request an interview with the Secretary, in order that he

may be given an opportunity of stating his case.

Accordingly, the Respondents are empowered to forward the said

recommendation to withdraw the commission of the Petitioner to the President.

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 22 of 24

Since the Petitioner is a Presidential appointee who has been granted his

commission in terms of Section 9(1) of the Army Act No.17 of 1949, he holds the said

commission during the pleasure of the President in terms of Section 10 of the same

Act. In the case of Air Vice Marshall Elmo Perera vs Liyanage and Others (2003) 1

Sri L R 331 the Court held that:

It was open to the President to terminate the services of the petitioner on

the basis that the petitioner holds office at the pleasure of the President.

The 1st respondent was merely carrying out a fact-finding inquiry and the

findings or recommendations of the respondent would not be binding on

the President.

Therefore, in the instant case, although the 1st Respondent made the

recommendation regarding the Petitioners withdrawal, the authority to withdraw the

Petitioners commission is on the President.

Based on the above submissions, it is the position of the Respondents that the

application of the Petitioner cannot be instituted in this Court as what is sought to be

challenged in an indirect manner is the right conferred on His Excellency the President

to grant and withdraw a commission to an Army Officer under Section 9(1) of the Army

Act No.17 of 1949. Since such acts qua President which directly flows from Article

4(1)(b) read with Article 30 of the Constitution, it cannot be challenged in a Court of

Law in view of the provisions contained in Article 35 of the Constitution. The

Respondents further claim that this application has been filed out of time.

Furthermore, the Petitioners service was suspended with half pay with effect

from 15th March 2010 upon the commencement of the non-summary inquiry bearing

No. N/S 29204 before the Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura. The Petitioners

services were suspended in adherence to the Special Army Order bearing No. 3/75.

Hence, although the Petitioners services were suspended, he continued be paid in

accordance with Regulation 2(2) of the Army Pay Code of 1982 which reads as follows:

SC FR 546/2012 JUDGEMENT Page 23 of 24

when an officer is suspended from exercising the duties and functions of

his office, other than on any ground referred to in the sub-paragraph (b)

here to, such officer shall receive in respect of each month for the period

during which he is so suspended one half of the consolidated pay payable

to him.

As per Regulation 3(1)(b) of the Army Pension and Gratuities Code of 1981, an

officer shall retire on the expiry of the period in the substantive rank he holds unless

he is promoted to the next higher rank within that period. As per the said Regulation

the relevant period for a Captain to hold office is 11 years. Accordingly, the Petitioner

in the instant case had reached the maximum period permissible within the said rank

with effect from 4th August 2015 (he was promoted as a Captain on 2nd August 2004).

Decision

As such, upon careful consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances of

the immediate case, I see no reason to allow the Petitioners application based on the

violations of his Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g).

Article 126(4) empowers the Supreme Court to grant such relief or make such

directions as it may deem just and equitable depending on the facts and

circumstances of each individual case. Hence, this court can overlook certain

objections in order to serve justice. As evident from the facts above the Petitioner did

commit an act which is unbecoming of the character of an officer and did thereby

commit an offence punishable under Section 107 of the Army Act No.17 of 1949.

Considering all, it is my view that the 1st Respondents decision to recommend

the withdrawal of the Petitioners commission is not in violation of his Fundamental

Rights as it is required to maintain good order and discipline in the Army.

Application Dismissed.
