"findings of a Court of Inquiry. In terms of Section 2 of the said Regulations, it is only"
"convened  to  collect  and  record  evidence,  hence  it  cannot  be  equated  to  a  trial."
"Therefore, the Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent has no authority to discharge"
"the  Petitioner  by  recommending  a  withdrawal  of  his  commission,  without  having"
"recourse to a Court Martial in terms of law. Accordingly, the Petitioner believes that"
"the  said  decision  of  the  1st  Respondent  is  arbitrary,  capricious,  ultra  vires,  unlawful,"
"illegal  and  has  no  force  in  law,  as  the  Court  of  Inquiry  was  held  contrary  to  the"
"procedure set out in the Army Court of Inquiry Regulations."
