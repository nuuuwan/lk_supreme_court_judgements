    "text": "As per the amended petition dated 12.12.2011 filed on behalf of the 20(a), 31st to 33rd Defendant-Appellant-Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Defendant- Appellants), the first judgment dated 28/06/1995 delivered by the District Court of Kuliyapitiya was set aside by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal directed to take steps and hold a trial de novo. The case proceeded to trial for the second time and, after trial the learned trial judge delivered his judgement on 09/05/2003 to partition the subject matter of the District Court action. Being aggrieved by the said judgement the 31st to 33rd Defendant Appellants lodged an appeal to the Court of Appeal which was subsequently transferred to the Civil Appellate High Court of Kurunegala. Aforesaid Petition of Appeal to the Court of Appeal has been tendered along with the Petition marked as P1. It must be noted at the beginning, the Petition of Appeal to the Court of Appeal dated 07.07.2003 tendered along with the Petition to this court marked as P1, has been referred to as the petition of Appeal of the 20(a) Defendant-Appellant appeared by his Attorney-at-Law Mr. Sunil Jayakody and it has been signed at the end by the Attorney-at-law of the 20(a) Defendant-Appellant but the prayer in the said petition is made by the 31st, 32nd and 33rd Defendant- Appellants. Relevant caption of the said petition to the Court of Appeal named only the 20(a) Defendant-Appellant as the Appellant. However, paragraph 13 of the original petition as well as of the amended petition to this court refers to a petition of appeal made by 31st to 33rd Defendant Appellants. Thus, in the first instance I wonder whether there was a proper Petition of Appeal on behalf of the 20(a) Defendant-Appellant before the Civil Appellate High Court which contained a prayer for 20(a) Defendant Appellant. However, in the amended petition to this court at paragraph 21, the Appellants state that the Learned High Court Judges dismissed both the appeals upholding a preliminary objection, indicating that there was another appeal",

In the said submissions made to the High Court (P2) to challenge the correctness of the journal entry dated 02/06/2003, the Appellants had contended that the said certificate dated 07/07/2003 could not have been handed over on 02/06/2003. The said certificate has been signed by the Registrar of District Court on 07/07/2003 deleting the word which is there to indicate the month of May. This shows that this form was prepared in May. As said before, when looking at the said deletion in the Registrars certificate along with the journal entry dated 02.06.2003, it is clear that the form which was to be perfected by the Registrar as his certificate was prepared in May and tendered on 02.06.2003 along with the other accompanying documents and, now the Appellants are trying to give a different interpretation to the contents in the journal entry using the date on which the Registrar signed the said Registrars certificate. Registrar has to sign and prepare the certificate only when he sends the brief to the Appellate court.
