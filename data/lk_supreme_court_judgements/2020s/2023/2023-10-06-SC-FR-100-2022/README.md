ARGUED ON : 12th December 2022

DECIDED ON : 06th October 2023

S. THURAIRAJA, PC, J.

The Petitioner, namely Rannulu Sugath Mohana Mendis, (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) filed an application in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka on the 23rd of

March, 2022 against the Respondents, for alleged violation of fundamental rights

enshrined under Articles 12(1) and 14 (1)(g) of the Constitution, and prayed inter alia

for his salary to be paid until the final determination of this Application.

When the matter was taken up on the 18th of May, 2022, upon hearing both Counsel,

the Court granted Leave to Proceed against the 1st 14th Respondents under Articles

12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. The facts and circumstances of the instant case

are set out in brief below.

The Petitioner is a Police Officer of the Sri Lankan Police and he had joined the Sri

Lanka Police on the 01st of July, 1995 as a Police Constable. He was promoted to a

Police Sergeant with effect from the 01st of May, 2007, and as a Sub-Inspector of Police

with effect from the 31st of May, 2018.

The Petitioner had served for more than twenty-five (25) years in the service of the

Police Force and at the time of filing the instant application, he was 52 years of age.

The Petitioner also claimed that his wife and three younger children depend on him.

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 5 of 18

Further, on or about the 01st of August, 2020, while discharging his duties as a Sub

Inspector of Police at the Embilipitiya Police Station, a Message Form had been sent

from the Colombo Crimes Division, which the Petitioner received on or about the 2nd

of August, 2020. Whereby, the Petitioner was asked to give a statement pertaining to

a suspect named Naligamage Dileepa Asanka Naligama who was arrested upon a

statement made by I.P. Wilwala Arachchi dated 11th of March, 2014.

Thereafter, the Petitioner was arrested on the 03rd of August, 2020 and produced at

the Gampaha Magistrates Court with a B-report bearing No. 1536/20/CDD on

purported allegations that the suspect had falsely introduced certain weapons that fell

within the ambit of the Offensive Weapons Act No. 18 of 1966, Firearms Ordinance

No. 33 of 1916 as amended by Act No. 22 of 1996 and the Explosives Act No. 21 of

1956 as amended by Act No. 33 of 1969. The B-report also alleged that the suspect

had fabricated evidence to frame and arrest the former Deputy Inspector General

Police, namely Sajin de Vass-Gunawardena. However, the investigations relating to the

said B-report were pending in Court as at the date of filing the instant application.

Subsequently, the 1st Respondent, namely the Assistant Superintendent of Police,

Embilipitiya (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent), issued a purported letter

of interdiction dated the 07th of August, 2020 (Ref: EM/ASP I/2416/2020), placing the

Petitioner on interdiction without pay.

According to the said letter, the Petitioner was alleged to have caused one or more

acts of misconduct set out in section 31:1 of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishment Code

(Volume II).

Section 31:1 of Chapter XLVIII of the Establishment Code (Volume II) reads as follows:

31. Interdiction and Compulsory Leave

31:1 Where it is disclosed, prima facie, that a public officer has committed

either one or some or all of the following acts of misconduct, the relevant

Police, namely Vass Gunawardena. However, the investigations relating to the said B-Rep-

ort were pending in Court as at the date of filing the instant application.

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 6 of 18

Disciplinary Authority, or the relevant Secretary to the Ministry of Head of

Department not holding disciplinary authority, may forthwith interdict the

officer concerned subject to the covering approval of the Disciplinary

Authority should be informed sending also a copy of such letter to the

purpose of obtaining covering approval.

31:1:1 Non-allegiance to the Constitution of the Democratic

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

31:1:2 Act or cause to act in such a manner as to bring the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka into disrepute.

31:1:3 Being prosecuted in a Court of Law on anti-government,

terrorist or criminal charges.

31:1:4 Being prosecuted in a Court of Law on bribery or corruption

charges.

31:1:5 Being drunk or smelling of liquor within duty hours or within

Government premises.

31:1:6 Use or be in possession of narcotic drugs within duty hours or

within Government premises.

31:1:7 Misappropriate or cause another to misappropriate

government funds.

31:1:8 Misappropriate government resources or cause such

misappropriation, or cause destruction or depreciation of

government resources willfully or negligently.

31:1:9 Act or cause to act negligently or inadvertently or willfully in

such manner as to harm government interests.

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 7 of 18

31:1:10 Act in such a manner to as to bring the public service into

disrepute.

31:1:11 Divulge information that may harm the State, the State

Service or any other State Institution or make available or

cause to make available State documents or copies thereof to

outside parties without the permission of an appropriate

authority.

31:1:12 Alter, distort, destroy or fudge State documents.

31:1:13 Conduct oneself or act in such manner as to obstruct a public

officer in the discharge of his duties, or insult, or cause or

threaten to cause bodily harm to a public officer.

31:1:14 Refuse or neglect to carry out lawful orders given by a Senior

officer, or insubordination.

31:1:15 Where it is considered that allowing an officer to perform his

duties is harmful or imprudent so far as the public service is

concerned.

The Petitioner stated that prior to receiving the purported letter of interdiction, he had

an unblemished career in the Police Force. Further, the Attorney General in his letter

dated 19th of October, 2011 (P3(a)), commended the Petitioner who was part of the

investigating team, stating high commendation in solving a gruesome crime, for his

contribution in resolving the murder of two young suspects while in police custody (in

the High Court Trial-at-Bar Case 5247/2010). Another letter issued by the Additional

Solicitor General, Jayantha Jayasuriya, P.C. (as he was then) dated 08th of July 2014

(P3(l)) commended the meticulous and diligent conduct of the investigation into the

Royal Park Murder Case, of which the Petitioner was an investigator and that letter was

forwarded to the Attorney General who sent another letter commending the

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 8 of 18

Petitioners work by letter dated 09th of July, 2014 (P3(m)). Apart from those, many

commendations, special increments and awards have been awarded to the Petitioner

by the Police Department.

However, as per the submissions of the counsel for the Petitioner, he was not served

with an indictment nor a charge sheet from the 2nd of August, 2020 until to date.

Furthermore, no preliminary investigation was carried out prior to issuing the letter of

interdiction.

Once the purported letter of interdiction was received, the Petitioners wife filed a

complaint on his behalf in the Human Rights Commission, dated the 2nd of September,

2020 (HRC/1906/20) which is currently pending before the said Commission.

Numerous applications made on behalf of the Petitioner to obtain bail were rejected

by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha. In or about February 2021, the

Petitioners wife filed an application for revision in the Court of Appeal to revise the

order given by the learned High Court Judge. Consequently, the Petitioner was

enlarged on bail by the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal in its judgement observed

the following;

It is my view that on account of the unusual and extraordinary delay in

lodging the first complaint despite every ability to do so demonstrates very

strongly that the allegations against the suspect Rannulu Sugath Mendis

are a result of falsification and embellishment and a creature of after-

thought. On account of the said unusual and extraordinary delay, the

complaint has not only lost the benefit of the advantage of

spontaneity, but also smacks of the introduction of a fabricated,

false version and an exaggerated account or concocted story

involving a set of collaborators or conspirators, to unduly cause

prejudice and harm to the suspect Rannulu Sugath Mendis, for

collateral purposes. Not only that the said delay has not been

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 9 of 18

satisfactorily or credibly explained. It is crystal clear that the statements

given by the said witnesses in 2020 are contradictory to statements given

by them in 2014.

Upon the statements of apparent backers and supporters or collaborators

of the convicted murders, purported facts have been reported in B/1536/20

to the Learned Magistrate's Court of Gampaha against the suspect, in a

blatant attempt to frame allegations through fabrication of false evidence

pertaining to purported commission of offences under the Penal Code and

for the purported possession of a cache of firearms, explosives and

ammunition in a manner that constitutes offence under the Offensive

Weapons and the Explosives Act. However, no credible evidence had

been brought to the attention of the Court to substantiate this

position or credibly establish a semblance of a prima facie case.

(Page 8-9 of the Judgement in Case CA (Rev.) Application No.

CA/CPA/19/2021)

(Emphasis added)

The learned Judges of the Court of Appeal further observed that with regard to the

purported possession of firearms under the Offensive Weapons Act No. 18 of 1966

and the Explosives Act No. 21 of 1956 as amended by Act No. 33 of 1969, it follows

no credible evidence had been brought to the attention of the Court to

substantiate this position or credibly establish a semblance of a prima

facie case.

The Petitioner further stated that he remained without his salary until the Supreme Court

made an interim order directing to pay his salary. The Petitioner stated that such

treatment is a continuing infringement of his fundamental rights guaranteed under

Articles 12(1) and 14 (1)(g) of the Constitution.

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 10 of 18

The Petitioner claims that the actions of the Respondents have violated his rights under

Article 12(1) and Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

Article 12(1) of the Constitution provides as follows;

All persons are equal before the law and are entitled to the equal

protection of the law.

Article 14(1)(g) of the Constitution provides as follows;

Every citizen is entitled to the freedom to engage by himself or in

association with others in any lawful occupation, profession, trade,

business or enterprise.

In light of the facts and circumstances of the instant case, there are two issues which

are required to be answered. Firstly, whether the Respondents are empowered by law

to take action against the Petitioner, and secondly, whether the actions of the

Respondents violate the rights of the Petitioner guaranteed by Article 12(1) and

14(1)(g) of the Constitution.

In addressing the first question of law, it must be considered whether the Respondents

have the authority to interdict the Petitioner in the manner stated above. As per Article

57(1) of the Constitution, the Public Service Commission (PSC) has delegated its

powers to the Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) under the Extraordinary Gazette

No. 2202/24 dated 20th of November, 2020. Thereby, the 1st Respondent being the

ASP has the necessary powers with regard to interdiction within the purview of

respective administrative area.

The Petitioners contention is that there was no preliminary investigation conducted

prior to interdicting him from the service or up to the time of the hearing of this appeal

and no specific reasons were given for his interdiction.

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 11 of 18

Section 31:3 of the Establishments Code provides for the manner in which notice of

interdiction should be conveyed to a Public Officer. Accordingly, the said section

provides that,

an authority who decides to interdict a public officer in terms of

subsection 31:1 above should note clearly and specifically in the

relevant file the reasons on which such a decision was based.

(Emphasis added)

Section 31:4 of the Establishments Code states as follows:

Normally a public officer should be interdicted on matters relating

disclosed in a preliminary investigation held into the charges against

him.

(Emphasis added)

However, the letter of interdiction dated 7th of August 2020 sent by the 1st

Respondent and received by the Petitioner states as follows:

II

XLVIII 31.1

2020.08.03

. .

The unofficial translation of the above is provided below;

Accordingly, as it appears prima facie that you have committed one or

more or all of the violations in accordance with Chapter XLVIII, Volume II,

Establishments Code of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka...

subject to preliminary investigation, your work will be suspended with

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 12 of 18

immediate effect from 03.08.2020 and will not be entitled to any

remuneration and other benefits."

It must be noted that the letter does not clearly and specifically state the reasons for

the interdiction of the Petitioner, as required under section 31:3 as cited above.

In terms of section 31:4 of the Establishment Code, a public officer should be

interdicted on matters disclosed during the Preliminary Investigation. It is pertinent to

note that well over two years since the interdiction, no such preliminary investigation

have been conducted. This is a blatant disregard of the disciplinary power vested on

the 1st Respondent as well as a grave injustice done to the Petitioner.

However, as per section 31:5:3 of the Establishment Code, a relevant authority can

interdict a public officer even without holding a preliminary investigation where Court

proceedings have been instituted against a public officer in terms of section 27 of the

Establishment Code. In such a scenario, at the very least, action should be taken to hold

a preliminary investigation as required under section 31:7 of the said Code. For the

purposes of the aforementioned provisions, the Respondent would constitute a

relevant authority.

Section 27 of the Establishment Code provides the procedure followed when a Court

of Law or Statutory Authority proceeds with a case filed against a Public Officer such

as the Petitioner, whereby section 27:1 of the Code provides that it must be reported

to the necessary authority to take action against the said officer.

Under such circumstances, under section 27:9 of the Establishments Code the

Petitioner should have been reinstated if the Disciplinary Authority determined that

his reinstatement will not adversely affect the interests of the public service, taking

into consideration the observation made by the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal

who granted the bail, and stated in his judgement that no credible evidence has been

brought to the attention of the Court to substantiate this position or credibly establish

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 13 of 18

a semblance of a prima facie case. However, no steps had been taken to reinstate the

Petitioner in his post.

Section 27:10 of Chapter XLVIII of Volume II of the Establishments Code, as amended

by the Public Administration Circular 06/2004 dated 15th of December, 2004 now reads

as provided below:

the Disciplinary Authority/ Administrative Authority should conduct a

preliminary investigation against such Officer within a period not

more than 02 months. The respective preliminary investigation report

should be submitted to the Public Service Commission by the Disciplinary

Authority/ Administrative Authority and if the Public Service

Commission determines that the reinstatement of the Officer

concerned is not detrimental to the interests of the Public Service

according to facts revealed by such report, such an Officer may be

reinstated in service.

[Emphasis added]

However, under the above section, if it is decided that the reinstatement would be

detrimental to the interests of the Public Service, then as per section 27:10:1, the

Petitioners interdiction will remain in force pending the final outcome of the case.

However, this section also provides that if the delivery of the Judgement exceeds the

timeframe of a year, then the Disciplinary Authority may authorise the payment of

salary not exceeding half thereof to the officer concerned. In the instant case, even two

years after the Petitioner was interdicted, no preliminary investigation was begun, nor

was he given his salary due to him. The Respondents have committed a grave error in

keeping the Petitioner on interdiction for a long period of time. There were numerous

opportunities to rectify their wrongs before this case was taken up in the Supreme

Court, but they have not done so.

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 14 of 18

The Petitioner has submitted letters to the Chairman of the National Police

Commission dated 1st of July, 2022, the Chairman of the Human Rights Commission

Sri Lanka, the Director of Police Ombudsman Division, and the Deputy Inspector

General of Police through the relevant chain of command, and requested for his

reinstatement. The Petitioner is yet to receive reasons as to why he was interdicted

from service.

If this Court were to criticise the actions of the Police Force, it need not look further

than the police motto itself; which states those who live

by the Dhamma are protected by the Dhamma. One would expect that the Police

force of Sri Lanka would follow this motto when carrying out their duties, without mala

fide. However, we observe, they have failed to stick to the basics of their code of

conduct and the principles of natural justice.

It is pertinent to note that when this matter came up in Court on the 18th of May, 2022,

Court made an interim order and fixed this application for hearing on the 21st of

September, 2022. Further, the Court made the following order:

Objections, counter objections, written submissions in terms of the rules.

On the 5th of August 2022, the Instructing Attorney for the Petitioner filed a motion

informing the Court that the Respondents have not complied with directions given by

the Court as well as not complied with the rules of the Supreme Court. He also

informed the Court that the interim order was not complied with. On the 14th of

September, 2022, the listing Judge-in Chambers made an order to support this motion

on the 21st of September, 2022, in Open Court, i.e. the date fixed for the hearing of this

application.

On the 21st of September, 2022, the said Attorney filed another motion stating that

the Respondents have not complied with order made by the Court as well as the rules

of the Supreme Court. Further, the Respondents have not sought or obtained any

further time for filing of objections and written submissions. Moreover, the Petitioner

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 15 of 18

has filed written submissions and objected for any time being granted for Respondents

to file objections.

When the matter was listed for hearing on the 21st of September, 2022, the learned

Deputy Solicitor General had sought permission to file counter objections or further

material in relation to the motion dated 5th of August, 2022 and Court granted time

until the 22nd of September, 2022. However, the Respondents did not file any

objections or any material to counter the facts stated in the said motion.

In the meantime, on the 14th of September, 2022, the Attorney-at-Law for the

Petitioner filed a motion and tendered the written submissions on behalf of the

Petitioner. In the motion, she categorically stated that the Respondents have not filed

any objections and therefore, they are objecting for filing of any objections and/or

written submissions.

On the 22nd of September, 2022, the 4th Respondent filed an Affidavit through his

Registered Attorney. Paragraph 6 and 7 of the Affidavit states as follows:

I state that an administrative difficulty as to the payment in full of the

salary to an officer serving an interdiction arose in making the payment in

full of the salary to an officer under interdiction and necessitated the Head

of the Department to be kept informed.

Vide Paragraph 6

I state that, in the circumstances, I brought the matter to the attention of

the Inspector General of Police (IGP).

Vide Paragraph 7

This is a completely different stance taken by the DSG before this Court on the 21st of

September, 2022. When the application came up in Court, on the 23rd of September,

2022, the Court observed that the DSG has not filed any counters or any other

materials other than the Affidavit of the 4th Respondent dated 22nd of September, 2022.

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 16 of 18

The Petitioner supported the motion dated 14th of September, 2022 and moved Court

to make an order. As the learned DSG neither filed objections, nor sought permission

for further time to file the same, as per the Supreme Court Rules, Court allowed the

motion filed by the Petitioner and refused to grant a date to file objections of the

Respondents. Thereafter, the application was fixed for argument for the 16th of

November 2022.

On the 10th of October 2022, the 5th Respondent, had filed an Affidavit dated 7th of

October, 2022. In the said Affidavit, it was stated that the Petitioner had been

reinstated in service on the 23rd of September, 2022, and is currently serving at the

Hikkaduwa Police Station and arrears of his salary had been paid.

Further, it is stated that the reinstatement was:

I. subject to Court orders and

II. subject to disciplinary action related to the incident (especially

Establishments Code Volume II Section 27:10).

This reinstatement is proof to show that the Respondents themselves have accepted

that their previous decision to interdict the Petitioner was wrong. Looking at the

hardships that the Petitioner has been subject to, in the words of Fernando, ACJ, in

Range Bandara v. Gen. Anuruddha Ratwatte and Another (1997) 3 Sri LR 360, this

treatment was

not the result of a mistake or error of judgment, but of a misuse of those

powers, of a kind which demoralises and demotivates the victim, and

indirectly the entire service"

When any State authority or the Sri Lankan Police arrive at a decision, that decision

should be supported by materials available to them. Further, the authority must be

able to defend the decision, if it is questioned before a Court of Law or a Tribunal.

Whether the Court decides to accept or disregard such evidence, they should be able

SC FR 100/2022 JUDGEMENT Page 17 of 18

to submit such evidence before the Court. In this application, the Respondents did not

file objections within the time given by Court. Hence, the averments in the Petition

filed by the Petitioner are not challenged. Accordingly, the Court is required by law to

act on the averments in the Petition and that did not happen, and were they unable to

defend their decision to interdict the Petitioner.

In a government service, the government servants should be able to work

independently without fear or favour. If the relevant authorities are unable to provide

such an environment, it will lead to corruption, which ends up in weak or poor

government service.

Decision

After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances outlined above, I hold that

the Petitioner's rights, as guaranteed by Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution,

have been violated by the Respondents.

Therefore, I direct the State to pay as compensation, Rupees One Million (Rs.

1,000,000) to the Petitioner within 3 months from the date of this judgment.

Furthermore, I direct the Respondents to retrospectively grant all salary increments,

benefits, and promotions to the Petitioner, extending up to the date of his retirement

from the Police Service if he has already retired from the service.

Application Allowed.
