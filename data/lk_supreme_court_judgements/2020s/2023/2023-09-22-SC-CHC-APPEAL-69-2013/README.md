Decided on: 22.09.2023

P. Padman Surasena J:

The Plaintiff-Appellant instituted action relevant to the instant case in the District Court of

Colombo against the Defendant-Respondent praying inter alia, for Specific Performance of the

Agreement of Sale bearing No. 749 dated 28.06.2002 produced marked P 1 (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Agreement) and an order directing the Defendant-Respondent

to execute a Deed of Transfer to have the land which is the subject matter in the Agreement

(P 1) transferred to the Plaintiff-Appellant. With the establishment of the Commercial High

Court, the proceedings of the case were later transferred to the Commercial High Court.

After the conclusion of the trial, the learned Commercial High Court Judge by his judgment

dated 30th May 2013, had concluded that the contract entered into by the parties as per the

Agreement of Sale bearing No. 749 dated 28.06.2002 (P 1) has come to an end due to the

impossibility of performance or frustration. The learned Commercial High Court Judge has

further held that the Defendant-Respondent is entitled to receive from the Defendant-

Respondent, a sum of Rs. Four Million (Rs.4,000,000/-) which is the sum of money paid as

the advance payment by the Plaintiff-Appellant as per the Agreement (P 1) with the legal

interest thereon since 01.11.2002. Being aggrieved by the judgment of the learned

Commercial High Court Judge, the Plaintiff-Appellant has lodged the instant appeal to this

Court seeking to set aside the judgment of the Commercial High Court dated 30th May 2013.

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 3 of 18

Before I proceed any further, let me briefly set out the background facts of the case. The

Plaintiff-Appellant on 28th June 2002, had entered into the Agreement of Sale (P 1) with

Pramuka Savings and Development Bank Ltd. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Pramuka

Bank) to purchase the land (belonging to Pramuka Bank) described in the schedule thereto,

for a price of Thirty-Five Million Rupees (Rs.35,000,000/-). At the time of execution of the said

Agreement the Plaintiff-Appellant had paid a sum of Four Million Rupees (Rs. 4,000,000/-) as

an advance payment. As per the Agreement, the Plaintiff-Appellant had undertaken to pay

the remainder on or before 30.10.2002.1

On 25.10.2002 the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) had issued an

order directing Pramuka Bank to forthwith suspend its business. CBSL by the said order

prohibited carrying out any business transactions by Pramuka Bank with immediate effect.

This is evident by the letter dated 25th October 2002 produced marked V 2(a). Subsequently,

in the year 2007, by press release dated 31.07.2007 marked P 13 it is apparent that the

Government had established a state bank by the name of Sri Lanka Savings Bank Limited

(the Defendant-Respondent in the instant appeal) to take over the business of Pramuka Bank.

The order vesting the business of Pramuka Bank in the Defendant-Respondent with effect

from 01.08.2007 has been produced marked P 14.

The Plaintiff-Appellant claims that by virtue of the vesting order marked P14 all rights and

obligations of Pramuka Bank was assigned to the Defendant-Respondent. It is the position of

the Plaintiff-Appellant that all rights and obligations including those under the Agreement of

Sale (P 1) stand transferred to the Defendant-Respondent as the Defendant-Respondent has

become the successor and/or permitted assign of Pramuka Bank in terms of the Agreement

of Sale. It was in the above backdrop that the Plaintiff-Appellant had taken up the position

that the Defendant-Respondent being the successor of Pramuka Bank must be compelled to

carry out the specific performance in terms of Clause 6 of the Agreement of Sale.

The Clause 6 of the Agreement of Sale is as follows.

Clause 6

If upon the Purchaser duly observing and performing the terms and conditions set

forth in this Agreement and on the part of the Purchaser to be duly observed and

1 Paragraph 5 of the Agreement of Sale bearing No. 749 dated 28.06.2002 (P 1).

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 4 of 18

performed and if the Owner shall wilfully refuse to execute a Deed of Transfer in

favour of the Purchaser in terms of Paragraph 5 hereof the Purchaser shall be

entitled to enforce specific performance of this Agreement, or in the alternative

the Purchaser would be entitled to receive his advance of Rs,4,000,000/- together

with interest thereon and a further sum of Rs.4,000,000/- not as a penalty but as

liquidated damages from the Owner. 2

Clause 6, by itself, has subjected the entitlement conferred on the purchaser for the specific

performance of the Agreement of Sale to three conditions. These conditions are embedded in

Clause 6 itself and could be identified as follows:

i. The Purchaser should have duly observed and performed the terms and conditions set

forth in the Agreement.

ii. The owner should have wilfully refused to execute a Deed of Transfer in favour of the

Purchaser in terms of Paragraph 5.

iii. The entitlement for the specific performance has not been conferred on the purchaser

as of a right as a right to an alternative remedy has also been given to the Purchaser

namely, an entitlement to receive his advance of Rs. 4,000,000/- together with

interest thereon and a further sum of Rs.4,000,000/- not as a penalty but as liquidated

damages from the owner.

As there is a reference to Clause 5 in the second condition above, it would also be necessary

to look at Clause 5 of the Agreement of Sale. It is as follows.

Clause 5

The purchase shall be completed on or before the Thirtieth day of October Two

Thousand and Two (2002) by the Purchaser tendering the balance purchase price

of Rs. 31,000,000/- (Rupees Thirty One Million) of lawful money of Sri Lanka to

the Owner and the Owner executing a valid and effectual Deed of Transfer in

favour of the Purchaser.

As regards the third condition, it is the position of the Plaintiff-Appellant that damages in lieu

of specific performance would not be adequate as obtaining an alternative land, even if

considered as substantially equivalent of the promised performance would not only be difficult

2 Emphasis is mine.

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 5 of 18

and inconvenient but also be undeniably impossible. The Plaintiff-Appellant has attributed

this to the significant increase of the value of the property within the area, over the time. It

is on that basis that the Plaintiff-Appellant has insisted on the specific performance as per

Clause 6 of the Agreement of Sale.

Be that as it may, the first condition above is a mandatory condition to be fulfilled by the

purchaser. In other words, the availability of the remedy of specific performance in terms of

that clause is available only when the Plaintiff-Appellant has fulfilled her obligations by

tendering the balance purchase price of 31 million Rupees on or before 30th October 2002.

This is because the Plaintiff-Appellant relies on Clause 6 of the Agreement, to seek an order

for specific performance against the Defendant-Respondent. Having considered the material

adduced in this case, I am of the view that this appeal could be disposed of only by considering

at the outset, the question whether the Plaintiff-Appellant has fulfilled her obligations by

tendering the balance purchase price of 31 million Rupees on or before 30th October 2002.

Indeed, it is the aforesaid first condition which is couched in the first issue raised jointly by

both the Plaintiff-Appellant and the Defendant-Respondent. The said issue No. 01 (in

verbatim) is as follows:

a) Was the Plaintiff ready and willing to complete the sale on or before 30.10.2002

by tendering the balance purchase price of Rs. 31,000,000 to Pramuka Savings

and Development Bank Limited?

b) Was the same accordingly informed to Pramuka Savings and Development

Bank Limited through the plaintiffs Lawyer by letter dated 28.10.2002?

c) Did Pramuka Savings Development Bank Limited by writing dated 28.10.2002,

fax to Plaintiffs lawyer its reply and confirm their Agreement to proceed with

the sale of the said Property?

As there are three limbs in Issue No. 01 let me first consider its limb (a) i.e., whether the

Plaintiff-Appellant was ready and willing to complete the sale on or before 30.10.2002 by

tendering the balance purchase price of Rs. 31,000,000 to Pramuka Bank. The Plaintiff-

Appellant had sought to prove this fact by stating that by 30.10.2002, she had raised the

required funds by selling the property in which her mother had resided and was ready to

tender the balance purchase price. The Plaintiff-Appellant had sought to substantiate the

above fact by relying on the Deed of Transfer produced marked P3.

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 6 of 18

The Deed of Transfer (P3) had been produced in the course of the trial subject to proof.

That was because of the objections raised by the Counsel for the Defendant-Respondent both

at the time of producing it and at the time of closing the Plaintiff-Appellant's case. In the

presence of the issues No. 04 and 05, one can understand the underlying reason behind the

afore-stated objection to the Deed of Transfer (P3) raised by the Counsel for the Defendant-

Respondent. The said issues No. 04 and No.5 (in verbatim) are as follows:

d) In terms of the averments contained in paragraph 9 to the Plaint did the

Plaintiff enter into the aforesaid Agreement of Sale No. 749 to the purchase for

the said property with the specific intention of using the said property for the

Plaintiffs residential purposes?

e) In terms of the averments contained in paragraph 10 of the Plaint, on or about

21.10.2002, were the residential premises owned by the Plaintiffs mother

Gulnar Saleem sold in order to raise funds to complete the transaction under

the Agreement of Sale No. 749.

The above questions have stood as issues to be answered by the Trial Judge. Before I consider

this aspect any further, let me at this stage consider briefly, the applicable law in this regard.

Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code deals with tender of documents in evidence in the

course of a trial. The explanation given at the end of that section would have some relevance

with regard to this matter. It is as follows:

Explanation to Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code.

If the opposing party does not, on the document being tendered in evidence,

object to its being received, and if the document is not such as is forbidden by

law to be received in evidence, the court should admit it.

If, however, on the document being tendered the opposing party objects to its

being admitted in evidence, then commonly two questions arise for the court:-

Firstly, whether the document is authentic- in other words, is what the party

tendering it represents it to be; and

Secondly, whether, supposing it to be authentic, it constitutes legally

admissible evidence as against the party who is sought to be affected by it.

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 7 of 18

The latter question in general is matter of argument only, but the first must be

supported by such testimony as the party can adduce. If the court is of opinion

that the testimony adduced for this purpose, developed and tested by cross-

examination, makes out a prima facie case of authenticity and is further of

opinion that the authentic document is evidence admissible against the

opposing party, then it should admit the document as before.

If, however, the court is satisfied that either of those questions must be

answered in the negative, then it should refuse to admit the document.

Whether the document is admitted or not it should be marked as soon as any

witness makes a statement with regard to it ; and if not earlier marked on this

account, it must, at least, be marked when the court decides upon

admitting it.

Let me at this stage consider whether the Deed of Transfer (P3) constitutes legally admissible

evidence as against the party who is sought to be affected by it even if it is assumed to be

authentic. The Deed of Transfer (P3) is a document which is required by law to be attested.

Therefore Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance applies in relation to its proof. According to

that section, such document shall not be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least

has been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there is an attesting witness alive,

and subject to the process of the court and capable of giving evidence.

The Plaintiff-Appellant has neither called at least one attesting witness to give evidence to

establish the proof of the execution of P3 nor adduced any evidence regarding the

availability/non-availability of such witnesses. Such evidence is necessary to ascertain:

whether the attesting witnesses are alive or have passed away; whether they could be

subjected to the process of the court if they are alive; whether they are capable of giving

evidence in Court. Thus, in that sense, the Plaintiff-Appellant has not proved the Deed of

Transfer (P3) according to section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance.

However, the above conclusion is not complete unless and until section 154A of the Civil

Procedure Code is also considered in that regard. This is because that section too would apply

for such instance. That section is reproduced below for easy reference.

Section 154A of the Civil Procedure Code.

1) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance (Chapter 14), in any

proceedings under this Code, it shall not be necessary to adduce formal proof of

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 8 of 18

the execution or genuineness of any deed, or document which is required by law

to be attested, other than a will executed under the Wills Ordinance (Chapter 60),

and on the face of it purports to have been duly executed, unless-

a) in the pleadings or further pleadings in an action filed under regular

procedure in terms of this Code, the execution or genuineness of such

deed or document is impeached and raised as an issue; or

b) the court requires such proof

Provided that, the provisions of this section shall not be applicable in an event, a

party to an action seeks to produce any deed or document not included in the

pleadings of that party at any proceedings under this Code.

2) The provisions of subsection (1), shall mutatis mutandis apply in the actions on

summary procedure under this Code.

3) Notwithstanding anything contained in section 2 of this Act, and the provisions of

the Evidence Ordinance, in any case or appeal pending on the date of coming into

operation of this Act

a)

i. if the opposing party does not object or has not objected to it

being received as evidence on the deed or document being

tendered in evidence; or

ii. if the opposing party has objected to it being received as

evidence on the deed or document being tendered in evidence

but not objected at the close of a case when such document is

read in evidence, the court shall admit such deed or document

as evidence without requiring further proof;

b) if the opposing party objects or has objected to it being received as

evidence, the court may decide whether it is necessary or it was

necessary as the case may be, to adduce formal proof of the execution

or genuineness of any such deed or document considering the merits

of the objections taken with regard to the execution or genuineness of

such deed or document.

I observe that during the course of the Plaintiff-Appellants evidence, when the Plaintiff-

Appellant marked and produced the relevant Deed of Transfer bearing No. 1456 attested by

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 9 of 18

Mohamed Cassim Mohamed Muneer the learned counsel who appeared for the Defendant-

Respondent in the Commercial High Court had informed court that the documents P3, P6,

P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P15, and P16 must be marked subject to proof.

However, the Plaintiff-Appellant had not taken any step to prove the Deed marked P3 (that

is the document which is relevant for the instant discussion). Moreover, the learned Counsel

for the Defendant-Respondent, when the Plaintiff-Appellant closed his case, had informed

court that the said documents (P6, P7, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P15, P16 and P17) were not

proved in terms of the Evidence Ordinance. The record indicates that the learned Counsel

who appeared for the Plaintiff-Appellant had been content only by replying to the aforesaid

submission of the learned Counsel for the Defendant by saying:

those documents have already been proved and I make the relevant submissions

at the end of the trial.

Thus, it is clear that the Plaintiff-Appellant according to the applicable law set out above had

not taken any step to prove the Deed marked P3. This is despite the fact that Defendant-

Respondent had objected to P3 being received as evidence and also objected at the close of

the Plaintiffs case to the Deed marked P3 being read in evidence. Therefore in terms of

Section 154A of the Civil Procedure Code, the court cannot admit P3 as evidence without

requiring further proof.

Let me now consider whether it is necessary in the circumstances of the case at hand, to

adduce formal proof of the execution or genuineness of the Deed marked P3 in the light of

the merits of the objections taken by the Defendant-Respondent with regard to the execution

or genuineness of the said deed. In this regard let me first ascertain the extent to which the

Defendant-Respondent has challenged the Deed marked P3 in the course of the trial.

To start with, I observe that the Plaintiff-Appellant answering the questions posed to him in

the course of the cross examination, has taken up the following positions:

i. She was not an account holder or a depositor of Pramuka Bank.

ii. She was only a bona fide buyer of the relevant property.

iii. She went to purchase the property through a broker.

iv. She went to the bank with her husband.

v. She cannot remember who she met at the Bank.

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 10 of 18

vi. She had signed the Sales Agreement in front of two Directors, a Company

Secretary and the witnesses who were there.

vii. She was living at Duplication Road which she had to sell, the sale of which she

concluded through Deed No. P3.

viii. She is now aware that the Deed No. 1275 dated 27.07.1999 (document P1) has

been challenged in another case in court.

ix. The Agreement for Sale was entered into in Colombo at Pramuka Bank in their

Board Room in Kolpetty, Colombo 3 and the said agreement was not entered into

in Wattala.

x. She got to know the suspension of activities of Pramuka Bank on the morning of

28.10.2002 and she had finished the sale of the House at Duplication Road,

coincidentally on the same day.

In my view, the nature of the above positions taken up by the Plaintiff-Appellant clearly cast

very serious doubts about the authenticity of the impugned transaction. That is not the only

factor. The fact whether the consideration mentioned in the Deed P3 had in fact passed, is

another question which cries out for proof. In this regard, I observe that according to the

attestation on P3 the consideration relevant to the said Deed of Transfer which is

Rs.35,140,000 (Rupees Thirty-Five Million Hundred and Forty Thousand) had been paid by

the purchaser at the execution of the deed in the following manner:

By cash Rs. 5,000,000/-

Rs. 6,000,000/-

Total Rs. 35,140,000/=

By Pay order Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited dated 11th October 2002 bearing No. 699679

By Pay order Nations Trust Bank dated 16th October 2002 bearing Nos.

002356 for 002406 for

Rs. 7,640,000 Rs. 12,000,000

By Pay order Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited dated 21st October 2002 bearing No. 699708 Rs. 4,500,000

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 11 of 18

Thus, it is clear that the major part of the consideration has been paid by three pay orders of

banks. It is relevant to note that the Plaintiff-Appellants evidence reveals some relevant and

startling facts in this regard. The said evidence has been quoted below which is self-

explanatory.

Q: In other words, the money was found only after the suspension order made

on the 25th of October 2002?

A: No, P3 that Deed showing that we sold our house, was completed on the 21st

of October 2002. After that we have got the money.

Q. Your position is you got the money on the 21st of October 2002? How did you

get that money, you got it in cash?

A. Rs. 5 million in cash, there was a pay order form Commercial Bank, it is all listed

in the Deed. All the monies are here. There are three pay orders and cash.

Q. It was Friday?

A. I dont know the day.

Q. You said that you found the money on the 24th of October 2002?

A. 21st of October 2002

Q. How did you get that money, you got it by way of cheque or cash?

A. We had cash and we had three pay orders.

Q. Pay orders?

A. Yes.

Q. You should have deposited those pay order into your account?

A. They would have been deposited because we had to get all the monies realized

for us to complete the transactions on or before the 30th.

Q. I am asking now you got the money as pay orders?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you said that you got on the 21st of October 2002?

A. Yes.

Q. When was it encashed?

A. We were ready and willing to sign on that date on the 28th, we got all these

monies and put into the bank, they got it that is why between the 21st, there was

a few days to get it all together and we were signing on the 28th, with the money

intact.

Q. I suggest to you, you are deliberately lying on this issue?

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 12 of 18

A. No, I am not telling lie, I dont have the place to live. My identity card gives the

same address.

Q. You were not ready with the money even prior to the date of 25th of October

2002?

A. No, I was ready with the money, I can get the Bank confirmation to say that

the monies were all realized, were all deposited and it was ready.

Q. Having failed to complete the transaction on or before the 25th of October 2002,

28th of October 2002, you made all the arrangements to write a

A closer look at the above evidence shows that the Plaintiff-Appellant had failed to prove to

the satisfaction of Court that the consideration had in fact passed through pay orders as

claimed by the Plaintiff.

From the answers the Plaintiff-Appellant had given to the questions posed to him by the

learned Counsel who appeared for the Defendant-Respondent during the cross-examination,

it is clear that the Defendant-Respondent had very seriously and in an unambiguous manner

challenged continuously, the authenticity of the Deed of Transfer P3 and the actual happening

of the whole transaction which the Plaintiff-Appellant had claimed to have happened. The

place of Agreement which the Plaintiff-Appellant says is not the place mentioned in the

relevant document. The Plaintiff-Appellant merely says it is a typographical error. As has

already been revealed, there is no adequate proof that the relevant consideration also has

passed.

The Plaintiff-Appellants assertion that the Deed of Transfer P3 was executed on the same

date that she got to know about the suspension of activities of Pramuka Bank by the Central

Bank, is also a strange coincidence. Courts are not bound to believe such fanciful stories

however much the witnesses harp on them. Further, such evidence must be evaluated in the

light of the other infirmities of the evidence of the Plaintiff-Appellant and the very suspicious

background in which this transaction had taken place. These suspicious transactions have

been more fully revealed in the course of this judgment in the next few pages.

Additionally, certified copies of the Deed of Transfer P3 have not been submitted and there

is no proof of P3 having been registered at the land registry. There is also no specific date on

which the Purchaser had signed that Deed of Transfer. These factors merely add on to

increase the questionable circumstances surrounding P3.

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 13 of 18

Thus, having considered the positions taken up by both parties at the trial in relation to the

authenticity of the Deed of Transfer P 3, I am of the view that the Plaintiff-Appellant is obliged

in law to take necessary steps to ensure that the Deed of Transfer (P3) is proved. The Deed

of Transfer (P3) is a notarially executed document; therefore, in the above circumstances,

section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance would apply with regard to the proof of P3. That is

necessary to prove the fact that the residential premises owned by the Plaintiffs mother

Gulnar Saleem was sold in order to raise funds to complete the transaction under the

Agreement of Sale No. 749.

As stated in the explanation to Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code the Plaintiff-Appellant

has not proved the authenticity of the Deed of Transfer at P3 even after the learned Counsel

for the Defendant-Respondent had objected to the production of the said document.

For the above reasons, I hold that the Plaintiff-Appellant has failed to prove the Deed of

Transfer produced marked P3 and thereby failed to prove that by 30.10.2002, she had raised

the required funds by selling the property in which her mother had resided in Duplication Road

and was ready to tender the balance purchase price.

Let me next consider limb (b) of Issue No. 01 i.e., whether the Plaintiff-Appellant has proved

that she had informed Pramuka Bank by writing dated 28.10.2002, her agreement and

readiness to proceed with the execution of the Deed of Transfer to effect the sale of the said

Property.

Plaintiff-Appellant has relied on the letter dated 28th October 2002 which has been produced

marked P4 in the Commercial High Court, to prove that she had fulfilled her obligations as

per the Agreement (P1) by the deadline i.e., 30.10.2002 (vide Clauses 5 and 6 of the

Agreement). It would be necessary to read through this letter to ascertain whether the

Plaintiff-Appellant had in fact confirmed her agreement and readiness to complete the sale on

or before 30.10.2002 by tendering the balance purchase price of Rs. 31,000,000 to Pramuka

Bank. The operative paragraphs of the letter P4 are reproduced below.

.. I write with reference to the Sales Agreement No.749 dated 28th June 2002

entered into between your bank and my client Mrs. Shahla Cassim of No. 7,

Dickmans Lane, Duplication Road, Colombo 5 whereby the bank agreed to

transfer the aforesaid property to my client on or before the Thirtieth day October

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 14 of 18

Two Thousand and Two, in consideration of a sum of Rupees Thirty Five Million

(Rs. 35,000,000/-) of which said sum of Rs. 35,000,000/- a sum of Rs.

4,000,000/- was paid to your bank as an advance by my client on 28th June 2002,

the balance sum of Rs. 31,000,000/- to be paid at the time of execution of the

deed of transfer.

It was agreed between the parties to execute the deed of transfer on the 28th of

October 2002 at 2.30 p.m as per the conversation had with your Assistant

General Manager Corporate Secretarial & Legal Mr. Surein J.S Peiris.

Subsequently my client came to know through media reports that the Central

Bank of Sri Lanka had suspended the business of the bank with immediate effect

for a maximum period of sixty (60) days thereby placing a legal impediment on

the bank to enter into a valid contract.

I wish to state that my client is willing ready and prepared to fulfill her obligations

under the aforesaid Sales Agreement No. 749 and expects to and holds the bank

responsible, in turn to fulfil the obligations of the bank under the said Agreement.

My client seeks an early resolution to the problem that has risen by the legal

impediment placed on your bank to execute a valid contract and requests you to

obtain written permission from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to complete the

said transaction.

My client proposes that in view of the circumstances arisen beyond her control

that she has be given written notice by Pramuka Savings & Development Bank/

Central Bank as to the date on which the Central Bank lifts the suspension order

on the Pramuka Savings & Development Bank to carry out banking activities and

that a mutually agreeable date be fixed to sign and complete the aforementioned

transaction and such date for signing be within 3-7 working days after receiving

such notice.

My client and I await your urgent and earliest response, and an expeditious

resolution of the matter. .

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 15 of 18

A closer look at the letter P4 shows that the Plaintiff-Appellant was aware that the Central

Bank of Sri Lanka had suspended the business of the Defendant-Respondent with immediate

effect at the time she had written P4. Moreover, there is only one general sentence stating

that she was willing, ready and prepared to fulfill her obligations under the Agreement P1.

However, the purpose and the focus of the letter cannot clearly be taken as a genuine

endeavor to get the proposed transaction completed on or before 30th October 2002 by

tendering the balance purchase price to the Defendant-Respondent. Indeed, one cannot find

a specific assertion in the letter P4 to the effect that the Plaintiff-Appellant was ready and

willing to complete the sale on or before 30th October 2002 by tendering balance Rs.

31,000,000 to the Defendant-Respondent and complete the transaction. To the contrary, P4

is a mere request made to the Defendant-Respondent urging it to inform her of the date on

which the Central Bank would lift the suspension order and to fix a mutually agreeable date

thereafter to sign and complete the proposed transaction within 3-7 working days after

receiving such notice. This clearly means that P4 is not a letter which confirms the Plaintiff-

Appellants willingness to complete the proposed transaction on or before 30th October 2002.

It also does not inform the Defendant-Respondent that the Plaintiff-Appellant has raised the

balance purchase price of Rs. 31,000,000 as per the Agreement. Although the learned

Commercial High Court Judge had chosen to answer the limb (b) of Issue No. 01 in the

affirmative, having regard to the above facts, I am of the view that the letter P4 should not

have been taken as sufficient proof of limb (b) of Issue No. 01. For the above reasons, I hold

that the Plaintiff-Appellant has failed to prove to the satisfaction of Court that she had

informed Pramuka Bank by writing dated 28.10.2002, her agreement and readiness to proceed

with the execution of the Deed of Transfer to effect the sale of the relevant Property.

Let me next consider limb (c) of Issue No.1 i.e., whether Pramuka Bank by writing dated

28.10.2002, confirmed to the Plaintiff-Appellant, its agreement to proceed with the sale of the

said Property.

The Plaintiff-Appellant had sought to prove that she had fulfilled her obligations as per the

Agreement P1 by the deadline (30.10.2002) set out in the Agreement relying on P4 and P5.

However, as has been mentioned above, the Plaintiff-Appellant at the time of writing the letter

P4, was aware of the decision taken by the Central Bank as per the document produced

marked V2 (a) and V3. It is appropriate to reproduce the operative part in P5, which is as

follows:

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 16 of 18

We refer to your fax dated 28th October 2002 on the above subject. We have

noted the contents thereon and wish to confirm that the Pramuka Savings and

Development Bank Limited agreed to same.

It is to be noted that the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on

25.10.2002, had issued an order directing Pramuka Bank to suspend its business. The said

order had also prohibited it to carry out any business transactions with immediate effect. This

is evident by the letter dated 25.10.2002 marked V2 (a). The following paragraphs of V2 (a)

would shed further light on the matter. They are as follows:

2. On the basis of the return on capital adequacy submitted by PSDB for the

quarter ending 31st March, 2002 and the examination conducted by officers of

the Bank Supervision Department of the books and records of the PSDB,

thereafter and the subsequent examination conducted consequent to the return

for the month ending 30th September 2002 dated 15.10.2002 and the returns

referring to in paragraph 1. I am satisfied that PSDB has a substantial negative

net worth and around 80% of the banks advances are non-performing. Even on

the basis of the PSDBs subsequent letter of 21.10.2002, around 75% of the

banks advances are non-performing.

3. According to information obtained in the examinations conducted by the

officers of the Bank Supervision Dept. and intimated to the PSDB and its Board of

Directors from time to time the extremely weak financial situation of PSDB cannot

be considered as a temporary phenomenon, because the deterioration of the

financial position of PSDB has been continuing over a considerable period of time.

4. On the basis of the above-mentioned examinations and the information

furnished by PSDB, I am satisfied that PSDB is insolvent and is likely to become

unable to meet the demands of its depositors, and that its continuance in business

is likely to involve loss to the banks depositors and creditors. I have reported

accordingly to the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in terms of section

76 M (1) of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988.

5. Having reviewed the facts and circumstances, the Monetary Board of the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka has made an Order in terms of the provisions of the

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 17 of 18

said section 76 M (1) directing PSDB to forthwith suspend business, and has also

directed me to take all measures as maybe necessary to prevent the continuation

of business by PSDB.

6. The PSDB is hereby informed of the above-mentioned Order of the Monetary

Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and is required, in terms of the said Order,

to suspend all its business with immediate effect. Accordingly, the PSDB is

prohibited from carrying out any business transaction with immediate effect.

The afore-stated contents of V2 (a) would proceed to show that the action taken by the

Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka was not a sudden action came as a surprise

either to the Board of Directors or to the Secretary of Pramuka Bank. Copies of this

communication have been sent not only to all the Directors but also to its secretary. Thus, in

as much as the Plaintiff-Appellant was aware of this decision (as revealed by P4), the Directors

and the Secretary of Pramuka Bank were also aware of the direction given by the Monetary

Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to suspend its business and cease to carry out all

business transactions with immediate effect. The Agreement (P1) between the Plaintiff-

Appellant and Pramuka Bank is no doubt questionable as both parties had entered into the

said Agreement on the verge of the collapse of Pramuka Bank. Although the Plaintiff-Appellant

had given evidence that she was prepared with the remainder of the purchase price by

21.10.2002, the Plaintiff-Appellant has failed to satisfy court as to why she waited until the

suspension of the business of Pramuka Bank to make that fact known to the other party.

I also observe that the document marked P4 by the learned Counsel of the Plaintiff-Appellant

had been faxed to Pramuka Bank at 11.30 am.

The letter P5 has been signed by Surein J.S. Peiris Assistant General Manager Corporate

Secretarial & Legal. The letter P5 does not assert that the author had any authority by the

Board of Directors to communicate what it had communicated. P5 is dated 28th October 2002

and the communication directing the suspension of the business of Pramuka Bank [V2 (a)]

is dated 25th of October 2002. Therefore, in any case, neither the Board of Directors nor the

author of P5 could legally have written any such letter. I also observe that P4 and P5 are

both dated on 28th October 2002; both have been faxed to each other giving no room for the

Board of Directors to make a considered decision on the purported decision the Pramuka Bank

claims to have been made according to the Plaintiff-Appellant as per P5. For those reasons, I

[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 18 of 18

hold that the communication P5 is not lawful communication and hence has no force or avail

in law.

For the above reasons, I hold that the Plaintiff-Appellant has failed to fulfil her obligations

under the Agreement of Sale (P1).

The law on contract is clear that if one party to a contract fails to fulfil his/her obligation said

party would be in breach of the relevant contract. Accordingly, a party in breach of contract

would not be entitled to an order for specific performance.

According to Clause 6 of the Agreement, which provides for the specific performance, such

remedy is available only where the Plaintiff-Appellant had fulfilled her obligations by tendering

the balance purchase price of 31 million on or before 30th October 2002.

In the instant case, the Plaintiff-Appellant has clearly breached her obligations under the

Agreement of Sale (P1). Therefore, she is not entitled to the remedy of specific performance

under Clause 6 of the Agreement.

For the foregoing reasons, I proceed to dismiss this appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 200,000/=

payable to the Defendant-Respondent by the Plaintiff-Appellant.
