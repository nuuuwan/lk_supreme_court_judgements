"[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 5 of 18"
"and inconvenient but also  be ‘undeniably  impossible’. The Plaintiff-Appellant has attributed"
"this to the significant increase of the value of the property within the area, over the time. It"
"is on that basis that the Plaintiff-Appellant has insisted on the specific performance as per"
"Clause 6 of the Agreement of Sale."
"B
e that as it may, the first condition above is a mandatory  condition to  be fulfilled by  the"
"purchaser. In other words, the availability of the remedy of specific performance in terms of"
"that  clause  is  available  only  when  the  Plaintiff-Appellant  has  fulfilled  her  obligations  by"
"tendering the balance purchase price of 31 million Rupees on or before 30th October 2002."
"This is because the Plaintiff-Appellant relies on Clause 6 of the Agreement, to seek an order"
"for specific performance against the Defendant-Respondent. Having considered the material"
"adduced in this case, I am of the view that this appeal could be disposed of only by considering"
"at  the  outset,  the  question  whether  the  Plaintiff-Appellant  has  fulfilled  her  obligations  by"
"tendering the balance purchase price of 31 million Rupees on or before 30th October 2002."
"I
ndeed, it is the aforesaid first condition which is couched in the first issue raised jointly by"
"both  the  Plaintiff-Appellant  and  the  Defendant-Respondent.  The  said 
issue  No.  01  (in"
"verbatim) is as follows:"
"a)  Was the Plaintiff ready and willing to complete the sale on or before 30.10.2002"
"by tendering the balance purchase price of Rs. 31,000,000 to Pramuka Savings"
"and Development Bank Limited?"
"b)  Was the same accordingly informed to Pramuka Savings and Development"
"Bank Limited through the plaintiff’s Lawyer by letter dated 28.10.2002?"
"c)  Did Pramuka Savings Development Bank Limited by writing dated 28.10.2002,"
"f
ax to Plaintiff’s lawyer its reply and confirm their Agreement to proceed with"
"t
he sale of the said Property?"
"As there are three limbs in Issue No. 01 let me first consider its limb (a) i.e., whether the"
"Plaintiff-Appellant  was  ready  and  willing  to  complete  the  sale  on  or  before  30.10.2002  by"
"tendering  the  balance  purchase  price  of  Rs.  31,000,000  to  Pramuka  Bank.  The  Plaintiff-"
"Appellant had sought to  prove this fact by  stating that by  30.10.2002, she had raised the"
"required funds by  selling the property  in which her mother had resided and was ready  to"
"tender  the  balance  purchase  price.    The  Plaintiff-Appellant  had  sought  to  substantiate  the"
"above fact by relying on the Deed of Transfer produced marked P3."
