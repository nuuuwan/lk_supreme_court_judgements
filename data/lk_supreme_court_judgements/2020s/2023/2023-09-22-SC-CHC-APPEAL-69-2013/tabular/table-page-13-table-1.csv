"T
hus, having considered the positions taken up by both parties at the trial in relation to the"
"authenticity of the Deed of Transfer P 3, I am of the view that the Plaintiff-Appellant is obliged"
"in law to take necessary steps to ensure that the Deed of Transfer (P3) is proved. The Deed"
"of Transfer (P3) is a notarially executed document; therefore, in the above circumstances,"
"section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance would apply  with regard to the proof of  P3. That is"
"necessary  to  prove  the  fact  that  the  residential  premises  owned  by  the  Plaintiffâ€™s  mother"
"Gulnar  Saleem  was  sold  in  order  to  raise  funds  to  complete  the  transaction  under  the"
"Agreement of Sale No. 749."
