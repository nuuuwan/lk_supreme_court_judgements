"[SC (CHC) Appeal 69/2013] - Page 15 of 18"
"A closer look at the letter P4 shows that the Plaintiff-Appellant was aware that the Central"
"Bank of Sri Lanka had suspended the business of the Defendant-Respondent with immediate"
"effect at the time she had written P4. Moreover, there is only one general sentence stating"
"that she was willing, ready and prepared to fulfill her obligations under the Agreement  P1."
"However,  the  purpose  and  the  focus  of  the  letter  cannot  clearly  be  taken  as  a  genuine"
"endeavor  to  get  the  proposed  transaction  completed  on  or  before  30th  October  2002  by"
"tendering the balance purchase price to the Defendant-Respondent. Indeed, one cannot find"
"a specific assertion in the letter  P4 to the effect that the Plaintiff-Appellant was ready and"
"willing  to  complete  the  sale  on  or  before  30th  October  2002  by  tendering  balance  Rs."
"31,000,000 to the Defendant-Respondent and complete the transaction. To the contrary, P4"
"is a mere request made to the Defendant-Respondent urging it to inform her of the date on"
"which the Central Bank would lift the suspension order and to fix a mutually agreeable date"
"thereafter  to  sign  and  complete  the  proposed  transaction  within  3-7  working  days  after"
"receiving such notice. This clearly means that P4 is not a letter which confirms the Plaintiff-"
"Appellants willingness to complete the proposed transaction on or before 30th October 2002."
"It also does not inform the Defendant-Respondent that the Plaintiff-Appellant has raised the"
"balance  purchase  price  of  Rs.  31,000,000  as  per  the  Agreement.  Although  the  learned"
"Commercial  High  Court  Judge  had  chosen  to  answer  the  limb  (b)  of  Issue  No.  01  in  the"
"affirmative, having regard to the above facts, I am of the view that the letter P4 should not"
"have been taken as sufficient proof of limb (b) of Issue No. 01. For the above reasons, I hold"
"that  the  Plaintiff-Appellant  has  failed  to  prove  to  the  satisfaction  of  Court  that  she  had"
"informed Pramuka Bank by writing dated 28.10.2002, her agreement and readiness to proceed"
"with the execution of the Deed of Transfer to effect the sale of the relevant Property."
