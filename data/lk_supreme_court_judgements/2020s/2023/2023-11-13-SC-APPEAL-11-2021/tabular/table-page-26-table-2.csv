"In Becke v. Smith (1836) 2 M & W 191, Parke B., states at 195:"
"It is a very useful rule, in the construction of a statute, to adhere to the ordinary"
"meaning of the words used, and to the grammatical construction, unless that is"
"at variance with the intention of the legislature, to be collected from the statute"
"itself,  or  leads  to  any  manifest  absurdity  or  repugnance,  in  which  case  the"
"language may be varied or modified, so as to avoid such inconvenience, but no"
"further."
