"public auction (parate execution). Very close to the date of the auction, the 1st and"
"2nd plaintiffs rushed to the Commercial High Court and obtained an enjoining order"
"preventing  the  bank  from  holding  the  auction  on  the  ground  that  this  Act  is"
"inapplicable 
to  mortgages  executed  by  persons  who  are  not  borrowers.  The"
"plaintiffs’ position was that the loan was obtained by the 1st plaintiff company and"
"the 2nd plaintiff who mortgaged the property as security to obtain the loan is a third"
"party. The plaintiffs relied on the majority judgment of the Five Judge Bench of this"
"Court (with one Judge dissenting) in Ramachandran v. Hatton National Bank [2006]"
"1 Sri LR 393 (hereinafter sometimes “Ramachandran”) which held that the right of"
"parate execution in terms of Act No. 4 of 1990 is not available to banks when the"
"mortgagor 
is  not 
the  borrower. 
In  short, 
the  Act 
is 
inapplicable 
to  what 
is"
"conveniently called “third-party mortgages”. However, the Commercial High Court"
"subsequently refused to issue an interim injunction preventing future auctions. This"
"appeal by the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs (hereinafter “the appellant”) with leave obtained"
"is from the refusal of the interim injunction."
"Two  years  after  the 
judgment 
in  Ramachandran, 
in  Hatton  National  Bank  v."
"Jayawardane [2007] 1 Sri LR 181 (hereinafter sometimes “Jayawardane”), a Three"
"Judge  Bench  of  this  Court  restricted  the  applicability  of  the  majority  decision  in"
"Ramachandran. In Jayawardane, it was held inter alia that when the directors of the"
"company are the mortgagors, they cannot be treated as third-party mortgagors since"
"they  have  directly  benefited 
from  the 
financial 
facility  made  available  to  the"
"company."
"Thereafter, later decisions such as Nelka Rupasinghe v. National Development Bank"
"[2014] 1 Sri LR 68 and DFCC Bank v. Mudith Perera [2014] 1 Sri LR 128 favoured the"
"majority judgment of Ramachandran (without reservation); and decisions such as"
"Yasodha Holdings (Pvt) Ltd v. People’s Bank (CA/WRIT/1268/1998, CA Minutes of"
