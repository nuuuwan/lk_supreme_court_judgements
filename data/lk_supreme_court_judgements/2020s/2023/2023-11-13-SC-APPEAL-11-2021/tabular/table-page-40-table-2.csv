"Every  statute  must  be  construed  ex  visceribus  actus,  that  is,  within  the  four"
"corners of the Act. When the court is called upon to construe the term of any"
"provision found in a statute, the court should not confine its attention only to"
"the  particular  provision  which  falls  for  consideration.  The  court  should  also"
"consider  other  parts of the statute which throw  light on the intention of the"
"legislature  and  serve  to  show  that  the  particular  provision  ought  not  to  be"
"construed as if it stood alone and part from the rest of the statute."
