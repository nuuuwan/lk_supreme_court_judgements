        SC/APPEAL/11/2021"
"Peoples bank Act no 29 of 1961 liable to be auctioned in terms of the respective acts"
"referred to"
"When considering the analysis of both draft judgments, I believe that Ramachandran"
"and  Others  v  Hatton  National  Bank  [2006]  1  Sri  L.R.  393  is  considered  as  an"
"important jurisprudence in our country and that  the  salient principles  set out  by"
"such  a  case  must  be  given  its  due  recognition  in  law  and  this  court  must  take"
"cognisance  of  the  importance  of  this  judgment  in  order  to  avert  injustice  in  the"
"future  by  overruling  the  same  and  the  matter  must  be  addressed  in  a  diplomatic"
"manner."
"The highlight of the decision of Ramachandran and Others v Hatton National Bank"
"[2006]  1  Sri  L.R.  393 
is  that  “the  provision  of  the  Recovery  of  Loans  (Special"
"Provisions)  Act  No  4  of  1990  will  not  apply  in  respect  of  a  mortgage  given  by  a"
"guarantor or any person other than a borrower to whom a loan has been granted by a"
"Bank or the economic development of Sri Lanka”"
"Considering the facts of this appeal I am in full agreement with my Learned brothers"
"that the interpretation that needs to be given Recovery of Loans (Special Provisions)"
"Act No 4 of 1990 by this court is that the Act applies to any property mortgaged to"
"the  bank  as  security  for  any  loan  in  respect  of  which  default  has  been  made"
"irrespective of whether the mortgagor is the borrower or a third party and not the"
"ratio as of the above mentioned case."
"However, we must keep in mind that prior to the decision of  Ramachandran and"
"Others v Hatton National Bank [2006] 1 Sri L.R. 393, where the majority decision"
"gave a restrictive interpretation of the term borrower and declared invalid  parate"
"execution  of  the  third  party  mortgages,  innocent  third  party  borrowers  had  no"
"protection  against  parate  executions  under 
the  Recovery  of  Loans 
(Special"
"Provisions)  Act  No  4  of  1990  and  we  must  ensure  that 
innocent  third  party"
"borrowers can still avail this avenue of justice in future."
