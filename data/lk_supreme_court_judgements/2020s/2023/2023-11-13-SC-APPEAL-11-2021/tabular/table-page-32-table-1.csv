"by the borrower is liable to parate execution is unacceptable as such construction",""

"An intention to produce an unreasonable result should not be attributed to a statute",""

"“borrower” must be interpreted to include the mortgagor who has provided security",""
"for the loan obtained by the borrower. This construction can be adopted in respect",""
