"and  can  be  used  as  an  aid  to 
the  construction  of  the  Act.  (Maxwell  on  the"
"Interpretation of Statutes, 12th edition, page 4)"
"Apart  from  the  long  title,  the  Act  does  not  contain  any  reference  to  support  the"
"argument  that  only  loans  granted  by  banks  for  economic  development  can  be"
"recovered under the provisions of this Act. The recovery of loans granted by banks"
"will contribute to the economic development of Sri Lanka; when money circulates,"
"the economy will prosper."
"The question arises as to why this special Act was introduced when the Mortgage"
"Act, No. 6 of 1949, as amended, was already there (and still is) for the purpose of"
"recovering 
loans  granted  by  banks.  The 
legislature  recognised  that  while  the"
"ultimate outcome remained consistent (the sale of the mortgaged property for the"
"recovery  of  loans),  the  duration  required  to  conclude  a  hypothecary  action  filed"
"under  the  Mortgage  Act  was  unreasonably  protracted.  As  a  result,  the  lending"
"portfolios  of  banks,  their  solvency,  financial  performance  and  other  factors  were"
"significantly compromised, directly impacting the country’s economic development."
"The 
classic 
example  would  be 
that 
after 
the 
Supreme  Court  decision 
in"
"Ramachandran  on  15.04.2005, 
the  bank 
filed  a  hypothecary  action 
in 
the"
"Commercial High Court on 22.06.2006 to recover the money by judicial sale of the"
"mortgaged property and this case still remains pending in Courts even after a span"
"of more than 17 years."
"Scheme of the Act: operative sections"
"Understanding  the  scheme  of  the  Act 
is 
important 
in 
interpreting 
its  various"
"provisions and discerning the legislative intent behind its enactment."
"The operative provisions of a statute are of great significance; they constitute the"
"enacting  part  of  a  statute.  Halsbury’s  Laws  of  England:  Statutes  and  Legislative"
