"In Sultana Begum v. Prem Chand Jain AIR 1997 SC 1006, it was held:"
"[T]he rule of interpretation requires that while interpreting two inconsistent,"
"or, obviously repugnant provisions of an Act, the courts should make an effort"
"to so interpret the provisions as to harmonise them so that the purpose of the"
"Act may be given effect to and both the provisions may be allowed to operate"
"without rendering either of them otiose."
