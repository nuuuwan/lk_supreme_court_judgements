"must be noted that the default is generally proved using records of the banks which"
"are considered as prima facie proof which may be hardly challenged only by cross"
"examination. Now the position has changed and the Banks have given the authority"
"to  pass  a  resolution  using  such  prima  facie  evidence  but  still  I  do  not  see  any"
"hindrance to access to justice and challenge such resolution prior to the entering of"
"certificate of sale. The difference would be that it is now the alleged defaulter or the"
"mortgagor who has to initiate proceedings."
"The 
learned 
judges  who  heard 
the  said  Ramachandran  case  and 
the  said"
"Jayawardena case mentioned above would have contributed their best to solve the"
"issues presented before them as per the submissions available before them. They"
