"Similar sentiments were echoed in The King v. Ettridge [1909] 2 KB 24."
"Bindra states at page 365-366:"
"When a language of the statute is plain and unambiguous it would not be open"
"to the courts to adopt a hypothetical construction on the ground that such a"
"construction is more consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act."
"But where such a plain reading leads to anomalies, injustices and absurdities,"
"the court may look into the purpose for which the statute was enacted and try"
"to interpret it so as to adhere to the purpose of the statute. If words are to be"
"added by the court in order to repair an omission in the Act, it should be possible"
"to  state  with  certainty  that  these  words  would  have  been  inserted  by  the"
"draftsman and approved by the legislature had their attention been drawn to"
"the omission before the Bill had passed into law."
