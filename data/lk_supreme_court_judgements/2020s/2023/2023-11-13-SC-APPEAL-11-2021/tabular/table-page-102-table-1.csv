"has been used uniformly in different parts of the statute and when Section 2 (1) of"
"the Act, No.4 of 1990 uses the words ‘’the mortgage of property’’,  it would connote"
"not  only  the  property  of  the  person  to  whom  the  loan  is  granted  but  also  the"
"property of a third-party who volunteers to provide security for the loan."
"F
urthermore, when Section15 (1) of the Act, No.4 of 1990 states that “all the right,"
"title, and interest of the borrower to, and in, the property shall vest in the purchaser…’’,"
"the  word  borrower 
in  the  subsection  would 
include  the  third-party  who  has"
"provided the security for the financial assistance."
"Before  I  part  with  this  judgement,  two  questions  repay  consideration.  What"
"does one make of the cases such as Jayawardane104 and DFCC v. Muditha Perera"
"and  Others?105 
  How  does  this  Court  deal  with  the  precedent  of  Chelliah"
"Ramachandran, now that it has been held to be incorrectly decided?"
"Since I have concluded that the property of  a third-party mortgagor becomes"
"liable  for  parate  execution, 
it  follows  that  the 
legal  precedent  of  Chelliah"
"Ramachandran has been wrongly decided. In the same breath a re-appraisal of"
"the Jayawardane case would be otiose as the property mortgaged by a director"
"for  the  loan  of  the  company  would  anyway  be  available  for  parate  execution"
"because of its character as a third-party mortgage. Laconically, on the strength"
"of the repudiation of Chelliah Ramachandran by this Court, lending institutions"
"would  no 
longer  require  the  aid  of  the  Jayawardane  case.  An 
immovable"
"property  mortgaged  by  a  director  would  now  become  available  for  parate"
"execution merely on the basis that it is a third-party mortgage that qualifies for"
"exposure to parate execution.   However, it has to be recalled that there were"
"arguments  for  and  against  the  correctness  or  otherwise  of  the  Jayawardane"
"decision and whilst the Petitioners contended that the Jayawardane case was"
"wrongly  decided, 
the  Respondent  banks
