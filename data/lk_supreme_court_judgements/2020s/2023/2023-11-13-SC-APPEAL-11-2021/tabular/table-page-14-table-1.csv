"a former Governor of the Central Bank, were members of the committee. The"
"committee 
submitted  a  valuable  report 
in  October  1985  with  detailed"
"recommendations and draft legislation for the improvement of the laws and"
"procedures relating to debt recovery."
"The Wimalaratne Report ran into considerable opposition from some sections"
"of  the  legal  profession.  As  a  result,  its  recommendations,  which  would  have"
"greatly  improved  the  debt  recovery  environment  in  the  country,  were  not"
"implemented at that time."
"A  committee  was  appointed  in  March  1988  jointly  by  the  then  Minister  of"
"Finance  and  the  then  Minister  of  Justice  to  examine  the  matter  further  and"
"propose  amendments  which  would  assist  in  expediting  debt  recovery.  The"
"committee was chaired by Dr. A.R.B. Amarasinghe, at that time Secretary to the"
"Ministry  of  Justice  and  now  a  Judge  of  the  Supreme  Court,  and  it  included"
"representatives of the Central Bank, the Sri Lanka Banks Association and the"
"Bar Association of Sri Lanka. The committee made recommendations for some"
"changes  in  the 
law  relating  to  debt  recovery.  The 
laws  proposed  by  the"
"Amarasinghe Committee were more restricted in scope and effect than those"
"which had been previously proposed by the Wimalaratne Committee."
"The  subject was  also  examined  by Prof.  Ross  Cranston, Professor  of  Banking"
"Law  in  the  University  of  London,  who  was  engaged  as  a  consultant  by  the"
"Ministry of Finance to report on the improvement of Sri Lankaâ€™s debt recovery"
"laws  and  procedures.  Prof.  Cranston  submitted  a  valuable  report  on  this"
"subject.  Like 
the  Wimalaratne  Committee,  Prof.  Cranston  recommended"
"changes in the law which were more far reaching than those which had been"
"proposed by the Amarasinghe Committee."
"All these reports were carefully considered by the Ministry of Finance and the"
"Central Bank. Based on the recommendations of the Ministry and the Central"
"Bank,  the  Cabinet  agreed  on  a  large  number  of  changes  in  the  laws  and"
