"Question No (ii)-   To the extent that veil lifting in HNB Ltd v. Jayawardane and Others"
"was not warranted on the facts and circumstances in the case, the ratio in the case is"
"incorrect and in view of the holding in this case now, any director who mortgages"
"his property would be a borrower within the meaning of Act, No.4 of 1990."
"Question No (1) -Yes"
"Question No (2) -Yes"
"Should Chelliah Ramachandran be overruled?"
"In view of the answers to the questions of law, another question arises before one"
"would part with this judgment. As I said before, the Divisional Court of this 7-judge"
"bench 
finds 
that 
the  4 
judge-bench  decision  of  Chelliah  Ramachandran 
is"
"irreconcilable  and 
it 
is  undoubtedly  within  the  competence  of  a  numerically"
"superior  Supreme  Court  to  overrule  a  decision  of  any  Court  containing  a  fewer"
"number of judges-see Bandahamy v. Senanayake.112"
"The  doctrine  of 
judicial  precedent  or  binding  precedent 
is  one  of  the  most"
"fundamental aspects of any legal system. Precedent is based on the maxim, stare"
"decisis et non quieta movere, literally to stand by previous decisions and not to"
"disturb  settled  matters; 
to  adhere 
to  precedents  and  not 
to  depart 
from"
"established principles.   In common law systems a large part of the law is made of"
"decided cases, i.e. judge made law or case law. These decisions carry the authority"
"of  law  upon  pronouncement  and  must  necessarily  bind  later  judges  to  ensure"
"certainty,  uniformity  and  finis 
litium  (an  end  to 
litigation). 
  The  doctrine 
is"
"important  to  give  the  system  a  sense  of  certainty  and  balance  and  to  make  it"
"acceptable to the public."
"But there are circumstances that destroy the binding force of a precedent and one"
"such  factor  which  is  often  cited  as  an  exception  to  stare  decisis  is  when  it  can  be"
"inferred that the deciding Court merely assumed the correctness of the propositions"
