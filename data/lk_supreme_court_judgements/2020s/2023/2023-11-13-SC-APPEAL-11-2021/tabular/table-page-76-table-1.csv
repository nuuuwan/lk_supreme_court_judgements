"Generally,  as  we  have  seen,  the  law  in  Sri  Lanka  had  set  itself  against  parate"
"execution  until 
the  Roman-Dutch  Law  rule  against  parate  execution  was"
"mitigated by the Mortgage (Amendment) Act in 1949 and the enactment of the"
"Act No.4 of 1990.  Over the years, however, a number of state or state related"
"institutions  have  been  given 
the 
right  of  parate  execution  by 
specific"
"enactments. Until the introduction of the debt recovery package in 1990, the right"
"of parate execution (i.e. the right of a creditor to sell the mortgaged property without"
"recourse to Court) had been restricted to the two state commercial banks, i.e., the"
"Bank of Ceylon and the People's Bank, and the other state lending institutions such"
"as  the  State Mortgage  and Investment  Bank, the National Development Bank, the"
"National  Savings  Bank  and  also  the  Development  Finance  Corporation  of  Ceylon."
"However,  with 
the  enactment  of 
the  Recovery  of  Loans  by  Banks 
(Special"
"Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990, all licensed commercial banks were given the power"
"of parate execution."
"The Bank of Ceylon Ordinance as amended."
"The  power 
in 
the  Bank  of  Ceylon  Ordinance 
is 
illustrative.  The  bank 
is"
"empowered to grant loans, advances or other accommodation on the security of"
"a mortgage of  any movable or immovable property. When default occurs, the"
"board of directors of the bank may authorize a person to take possession of any"
"immovable property or seize any movable property mortgaged to the bank and"
"to  manage  and  maintain  such  property  as  might  have  been  done  by  the"
"mortgagor if he had not made default.63 Moreover, S. 19 provides that the Board"
"of Directors may resolve to authorize a specified person to sell by public auction"
"any movable or immovable property mortgaged to the bank as security for any"
"loan in respect of which default has been made in order to recover the whole of"
"the unpaid portion of such loan, and the interest due up to the date of the sale,"
"together with the monies and costs recoverable under S. 18. If the mortgaged"
"63 Bank of Ceylon Ordinance, as amended by Act No. 34 of 1968 and Law No. 10 of 1974, s. 17."
"See also s. 18 on the manager's powers."
