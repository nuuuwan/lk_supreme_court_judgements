"Provided  that  the  costs  incurred  under  paragraph  (b)  shall  not  exceed  such"
"percentage of the loan as may be prescribed."
"Section 13 empowers the bank to recover the expenses and costs incurred by the"
"bank in conducting the  sale  from the  borrower in accordance  with the  covenants"
"contained in the mortgage bond executed by the borrower. The literal interpretation"
"of  this  section  suggests  that  the  bank  can  recover  expenses  as  contained  in  the"
"mortgage bond if the mortgage bond was executed by the borrower, not by a third"
"party."
"When  the  operative  section  of  the  Act  empowers  the  bank  to  sell  any  property"
"mortgaged  to  the  bank  (regardless  of  who  mortgages  the  property),  can  this"
"subordinate provision of the Act nullify the full effect of the operative section of the"
"Act? The purposive interpretation of this section is when the mortgage is executed"
"by a third party, the term “borrower” should mean both the individual who borrows"
"money by mortgaging the property and the third party who mortgages the property"
"on behalf of that individual. That is the way to suppress the mischief and advance"
"the  remedy.  A  construction  that  is  excessively  literal  should  be  avoided  when  it"
"results in an absurdity, especially if a more flexible interpretation would better serve"
"the practical implementation of the Act."
