"Chief Justice Beaumont, in Emperor v. Somadhai Govindbhai (1938) 40 BOMLR 1082"
"remarked:"
"I protest against the suggestion that a Judge, construing an Act of Parliament,"
"is a mere automaton whose only duty is to give out what he considers to be the"
"primary meaning of the language used. A Judge must always consider the effect"
"of any construction which he is asked to put on an Act of Parliament, and if he"
"comes to the conclusion that a particular construction leads to a result which"
"he considers irrational or unfair, he is entitled, and indeed bound, to assume"
"that the Legislature did not intend such a construction to be adopted, and to"
"try to find some more rational meaning to which the words are sensible."
