"56         
        SC/APPEAL/11/2021"
"before  us  contend  that  Jayawardane  case    represents  the  correct  view  of  the  law"
"concerning mortgages executed by a director of a corporate borrower."
"In  a  nutshell,  as  the  law  stands  today  in  the  wake  of  these  two  decisions,  two"
"propositions of law stand out as plain as a pikestaff."
"1)  In  terms  of  the  majority  decision  of  Chelliah  Ramachandran,  a 
lending"
"institution cannot sell by auction the mortgaged property of a person unless"
"he is also the borrower of the loan."
"2)  But  in  the  case  of  a  corporate  borrower,  HNB  v.  Jayawardane  and  Others"
"establishes  that  parate  execution  of  third-party  mortgages  is  permitted,"
"where  the  so-called  third-party  mortgagor  is  a  director  of  the  borrower"
"company,  who  fully  owned  and  controlled  the  corporate  borrower  to  the"
"extent of being its alter ego."
"Both these propositions come up for a re-appraisal before this bench of 7 judges and"
"If I may paraphrase the words of  the English Court of Appeal  in R (Association of"
"British Civilian Internees (Far East Region) v Secretary of State for Defence4  to"
"describe the pith and substance of the arguments of all leading President’s Counsel"
"for 
the  banks, 
the 
time  has  come 
to  perform 
the  burial 
rites  of  Chelliah"
"Ramachandran, whilst the  President’s Counsel, who in a lone battle against the array"
"of  President’s  Counsel  espoused  the  cause  of  the  Petitioners, 
  has  strenuously"
"contended  that  it  is  HNB  Ltd  v.  Jayawardane  and  Others  (the  Jayawardane  case)"
"which must suffer extinction."
"It cannot be gainsaid that when the majority of 4 judges (S.N.Silva, C.J, Jayasinghe, J,"
"Udalagama, J and Dissanayake, J with Shirani Bandaranayake, J dissenting), out of"
"the  5  judges  who  heard  the  eponymous  case  of  Ramachandran  and  Another  and"
"Anandasiva and Another v. Hatton National Bank,  decided on 15 April 2005  that it"
"4 (2003) EWCA Civ 473."
