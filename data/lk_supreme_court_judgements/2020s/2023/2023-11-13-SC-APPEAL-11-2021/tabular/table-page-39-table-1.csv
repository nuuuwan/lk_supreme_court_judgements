"Registrar of Lands, revest the said property in the borrower as though the sale"
"under this Act has never been made."
"According to the literal construction of this section, the endorsement of cancellation"
"on the certificate of sale shall revest the mortgaged property in the borrower as if"
"the sale had never taken place. For the property to be revested, the borrower must"
"have been the owner in the first place. Any argument that such an endorsement shall"
"vest the property in the borrower whether or not he was the owner is untenable. If"
"the sale is deemed not to have taken place, the property will revert to the original"
"owner, who could be either the borrower or a third party. If the term “borrower” is"
"given a liberal meaning to include the mortgagor who is not the borrower, no other"
