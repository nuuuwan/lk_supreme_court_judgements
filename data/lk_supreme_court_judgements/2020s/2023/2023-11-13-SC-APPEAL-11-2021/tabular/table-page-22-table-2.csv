"in  the  control  and  management  of  such  undertaking  as  might  have  been"
"exercised if such property had been pledged or mortgaged."
"It is clear that section 4 of the Act, which serves as the central provision, empowers"
"the board of directors of the bank to pass a resolution authorising any person “to"
"sell by public auction any property mortgaged to the bank as security for any"
"loan  in  respect  of  which  default  has  been  made”  irrespective  of  whether  the"
"property was mortgaged by the borrower or a third party. The focus in sections 3-5"
"is  on  the  mortgaged property and the  mortgagor;  who mortgages the  property is"
"immaterial."
