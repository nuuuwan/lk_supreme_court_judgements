"whether  the  loan  was  released  in  the  name  of  the  mortgagor  or  not,  mortgage"
"property is subject to parate execution in terms of the Act No 4 of 1990 and other"
"similar provision found in other relevant Acts, on which the State Banks which were"
"represented before us rely."
"I  observe  that  my  brother  Judge  Honorable  Samayawardhena  J.  and  Honourable"
"Nawaz J. have answered the questions of Law No. 1, 3, and 4 in the same manner,"
"namely question No. 1 in the Negative and No. 3 and 4 in the affirmative, for which I"
"also agree.  Honourable Samayawardhena J. has considered the 2nd question of law"
"as one that does not arise. Honourable Nawaz J. has answered the 2nd question of"
"law  with  certain  comments.  In  my  view, 
irrespective  of  reasons  given  by  the"
"Honourable judges who decided the Hatton National Bank V Jayawardane (2007)"
"1 Sri L R 181, due to the conclusions reached in this case, any property mortgaged"
"to a bank to obtain a loan subject to the provisions of the relevant act is subject to"
"parate execution. Thus, the 2nd question of law has to be answered stating that any"
"director of a corporate entity who mortgage his property for a loan obtained by the"
"corporate entity is a borrower within the meaning of Act No.4 of 1990."
"I prefer to add few observations in the matter at hand with regard to the nature of"
"obligations  created  by  a  Mortgage.  Philip  S  James  in  his  book  ‘Introduction  to"
"English  Law’,  12th  Edition,  by  Butterworths,  at  page  464  explains  the  origin  of"
"Mortgage as follows;"
"“There  are  two  principal  forms  of  security,  ‘personal’  security  and  ‘real’  security."
"Personal security usually requires a person who  will stand surety for the debt.  Real"
"security requires some form of property; the borrower may, for instances, secure the"
"loan by giving the lender a possession of his watch. If he is lucky, however, the borrower"
"may own land; in this case he will be able to secure the debt upon the land. The best"
"way of securing a debt upon land is by way of mortgage. ‘Mortgage’ is a strange word."
"It is said to derive from the ancient practice by which the borrower conveyed the land"
"to the lender with a proviso for reconveyance should the loan be paid by a certain date;"
"if the loan is not paid on that date the land become dead pledge (‘mortgage’) forever"
