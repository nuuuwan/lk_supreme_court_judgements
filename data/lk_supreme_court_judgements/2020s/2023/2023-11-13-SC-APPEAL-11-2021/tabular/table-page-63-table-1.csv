"63         
        SC/APPEAL/11/2021"
"in the purchaser” in section 15 (1) makes it patently clear that it is the property of"
"the actual borrower that could be sold."
"A harmonious construction, according to Mr. Sahabandu PC, of the sections in the"
"Act must necessarily lead to this interpretation.  On the other hand, Dr. Romesh de"
"Silva, PC argued otherwise. He strenuously contended that a literal construction of"
"the word borrower and its linkage to any property of the actual borrower will result"
"in absurdity and lead to the frustration of the purpose which the Act, No.4 of 1990"
"sought  to  achieve  and  in  order  to  advance  the  remedy  of  speedy  and  effective"
"recovery of non-performing loans, the word borrower must be given an expansive"
"meaning  to  include  a  third-party  mortgagor.  So,  the  crux  of  the  argument  of  the"
"learned  President’s  Counsel 
insisted  on  a  repudiation  of 
the 
literal  rule  of"
"construction 
in  respect  of 
the  word  borrower,  which  profusely  pervades 
the"
"provisions of the Act, No 4 of 1990."
"Thus, the  cardinal issue  in the  case  before  us boils down  to this  nitty-gritty. How"
"should the harmonization of the provisions in the Act, No. 4 of 1990 be achieved? Is"
"it  by  placing  a  restrictive  interpretation  on  the  word  borrower  as  was  done  in"
"Chelliah Ramachandran or expanding it to include a third-party mortgagor who is"
"another  person  other  than  the  actual  borrower?  After  all,  one  of  the  elementary"
"rules of statutory interpretation is that, when there is a doubt about their meaning,"
"the words of statutes are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonize"
"with the object of the enactment."
"In light of all these arguments it falls to this Court to ascertain the meaning of the"
"relevant words bearing in mind the fact that “some general words are capable of more"
"than  one  meaning  depending  on  whether  the  word 
is 
interpreted  narrowly  or"
"broadly”6.    Let  me  state  at  the  very  outset  that  whether  one  interprets  a  word"
"narrowly or broadly depends on context. I will return to this after having discussed"
