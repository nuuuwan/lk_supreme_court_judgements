"of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Bill. Acts from No. 2 of 1990 to No. 14 of 1990"
"were all certified on 06.03.1990. Although at first glance, the Acts listed under (3)-"
"(6), (9), and (10) above may seem out of place, a contextual reading reveals that the"
"intention of the legislature was to include them as part of a comprehensive package"
"aimed at fostering the economic development of the country."
"A stable financial system is crucial for ensuring robust economic development in any"
