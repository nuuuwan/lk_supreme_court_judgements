        SC/APPEAL/11/2021"
"explaining all the provisions contained in these Bills. I would like, however, to"
"refer to the provisions of two of the most important Bills."
"The Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Bill provides a special procedure for the"
"recovery  of 
loans  by 
lending 
institutions.  In  terms  of  this  Bill,  a 
lending"
"institution can file a plaint in court setting out particulars of the loan in default."
"The court will then enter a decree nisi against the debtor. The decree nisi will"
"be sent by registered post to the debtor or, where the debtor is an employee, it"
"will be served through the employer. The debtor can then file an affidavit in"
"court stating that there is an issue or a question which has to be tried by the"
"court. If the defendant fails to show sufficient cause, the court will convert the"
"decree nisi into a decree absolute. Thereafter it is not necessary for the lending"
"institution to go to court again for a writ of execution. The decree absolute itself"
"will be deemed to be a writ of execution issued to the Fiscal. The new procedure"
"will be available to all banks and finance companies in the country."
"Another  important  change  is  introduced  in  the  Recovery  of  Loans  by  Banks"
"(Special Provisions) Bill. Under this Bill the right of parate execution which has"
"already been granted to the State banks will be extended to all banks in the"
"country,  but  not  to  the  finance  companies.  The  right  of  parate  execution"
"enables a lending institution to sell the property mortgaged to it by a debtor"
"who is in default without seeking the intervention of a court of law. Modern"
"banking 
laws 
in  other  countries, 
in  developed  countries 
like  the  United"
"Kingdom  as  well  as  developing  countries  like  Singapore,  allow  the  right  of"
"parate  execution  to  banking  institutions.  The  right  of  parate  execution  will"
"cover all property mortgaged to a bank whether movable or immovable..."
