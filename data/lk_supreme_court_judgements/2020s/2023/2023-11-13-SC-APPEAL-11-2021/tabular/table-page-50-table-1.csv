"of Law and the exercise of judicial power, should be examined, considered and"
"decided upon."
"After referring inter alia to Articles 3, 4, 12(1), 105(1) of the Constitution, rules of"
"natural justice etc. the Court repeated this at page 401:"
"These are basic concepts but they have to be restated as the perspective from"
"which  any  departure 
from  the  established 
law  and  procedure  should  be"
"examined and decided upon."
"I cannot but agree with Dr. De Silva, P.C. when he emphasises that there was no need"
"to reexamine, reconsider and decide on, what had already been decided by a Five"
"Judge Bench of the Supreme Court. The underlying reasoning of the majority view"
"was based on Their Lordships’ belief that Act No. 4 of 1990 ought not to have been"
"made  into  law  in  the  first  place  as  it  had  been  enacted  in  breach  of  the  rights"
"enshrined under Articles 3, 4, 12(1) and 105(1) of the Constitution. As seen from"
"pages 401-404 of the Ramachandran judgment, it is on this basis Their Lordships"

"mortgagor,  the  bank  cannot  subject  the  mortgaged  property  to  parate  execution"
"without judicial process. However, later in the judgment at page 405 Their Lordships"
"take the view that there “may be some justification” for parate execution against the"
"borrower  “on  the  basis  that  the  person  to  whom  the  loan  is  granted  being  the"
"borrower, has a continuing transaction with the Bank and should know the amounts"
"paid by him or are in default.”"
"This approach, Dr. De Silva, P.C. submits, goes against the constitutional framework"
"of  our  Constitution.  In  our  Constitution,  there  is  no  provision  for  reviewing  a"
"decision  made  (under  Article  123) 
in  a  Special  Determination  regarding  the"
"constitutionality of a Bill by a subsequent Bench. Nor does the Constitution provide"
"for  the  review  of  the  constitutionality  of  an  Act.  In  terms  of  Article  80(3)  of  the"
