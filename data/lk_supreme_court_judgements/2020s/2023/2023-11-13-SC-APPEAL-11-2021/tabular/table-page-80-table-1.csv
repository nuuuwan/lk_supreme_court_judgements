"judicial power articulated by Griffith CJ in the Australian case of Huddart Parker v."
"Moorehead:67"
"“The words “judicial power” as used in S.71 of the Constitution mean the power"
"which every sovereign authority must of necessity have to decide controversies"
"between its subjects, or between itself and its subjects, whether the rights relate"
"to life, liberty or property. The exercise of this power does not begin until some"
"tribunal which has power to give a binding and authoritative decision (whether"
"subject to appeal or not) is called upon to take action.”68"
