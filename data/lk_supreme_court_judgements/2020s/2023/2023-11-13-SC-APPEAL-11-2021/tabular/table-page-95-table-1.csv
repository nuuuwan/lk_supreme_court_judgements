"","“The submissions of Counsel for the Petitioner [in Ramachandran’s case], is that"
"","the class of persons is clearly identified in the provisions of the Act commencing"
"","from Section 2 itself. Section 2(1)(a) requires ‘every person to whom any loan"
"","is granted by a Bank on the mortgage of property’ to register with the Bank the"
"","address to which a notice to him may be sent. I am inclined to agree with this"
"","submission  since  a  Resolution  of  the  Board  to  sell  by  Public  Auction,  as"
"","empowered by Section 4, has to be dispatched to this address in terms of Section"
"","8.  Similarly, the notice of sale in terms of Section 9 should be dispatched to that"

"","be paid by the Bank to the borrower. This clearly established that it is only the"

"loan  granted 
to  him. 
 
If","the  provisions  are  extended  by  a  process  of"
"","interpretation to cover a mortgage given by a guarantor, Section 14 will bring"
"","about a preposterous result in which the guarantor’s property is sold and the"
"","excess recovered is paid by the Bank to the borrower. It is when confronted with"
"","their unanswerable contention that the Counsel for the Banks submitted that"
"","the term borrower should be interpreted to include any debtor and that where"
"","a loan is in default the guarantor would be a debtor.  The words ‘borrower’,"
