"I hasten to reiterate that, whichever rule(s) may be applied, the basic task will always",""
"be to give a meaning to the particular words used in the statute in question. Each",""
"rule is simply a means by which that may be achieved. They may be used singly or in",""
"combination. I will add further that judges are not bound to follow one (or indeed",""
"any) of them and do not have to announce in any way which “rule” they have used.",""
"It is perhaps better, then, to think of them as  approaches to interpretation or as a",""
"framework for discussion, rather than as traditional rules or canons. Let me briefly",""
"refer to them and thereafter invoke other aids to construction which I think should",""
"be called in in order to resolve the issue before us namely should the word borrower",""
"in the Act, No.4 of 1990 bring within its scope the Petitioners who have provided the",""
"mortgage securities to the banks in question?",""
"It has to be recalled that whilst Mr. Rohan Sahabandu relied on the literal rule on",""
"behalf of the Petitioners, Dr. Romesh de Silva for the intervenient bank advanced the",""
"mischief rule as the approach that should help ascertain the meaning of the word",""
"borrower and consequently the phrase any property mortgaged to the banks.",""
"Suffice  it  to  set  out  in  brief  the  bare  essentials  of  the  rules  that  surfaced  in  the",""
"arguments of the learned Counsel before us, though it would appear academic.  All",""
"such attempts prove to be nothing but the goal of ascribing the suggested meanings",""
"to the words borrower and the property mortgaged.",""
"The Literal rule.",""
"The literal rule provides that words must be given their plain, ordinary and literal",""
"meaning. The crux of the argument of Mr. Rohan Sahabandu PC was an invocation",""
"of the literal rule to the effect that the plain, ordinary and literal meaning of the word",""
"borrower would mean no one other than the actual borrower.",""
"The rationale behind the use of the literal rule is that if the words of the statute are",""
"clear  they  must  be  applied  as  they  represent  the","intention  of  Parliament  as"
"expressed in the words used. This is so even if the outcome is harsh or undesirable.",""
