Argued on: 15/05/2023

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The 1st and 2nd Complainants, presently, 1A and 2A Substituted Complainant-Petitioner-

Respondent-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Complainant-Appellants) are the

landlords of a paddy field known as Helambagahakumbura, in extent 10A, 3R and 4P.

Hatharasinghe Arachchige Thomas was the tenant cultivator of 4A, 3R, 4P of the said

paddy field and Gimara Dissanayake his wife, (hereinafter referred to as Thomas and

Gimara respectively), was the tenant cultivator of the rest of the 6A of paddy land. The

said Thomas and Gimara died in December 1992 and early 1993 respectively. After the

death of the tenant cultivators, Hatharasinghe Arachchige Ranjith Premalal and

Hatharasinghe Arachchige Gnanasiri, the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondent-

Appellant-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1st and 2nd Respondent-

P a g e 6 | 14

Respondents), the two sons of the said tenant cultivators, continued to cultivate the said

paddy land.

Having claimed that the said children of the tenant cultivators, namely the 1st and 2nd

Respondent Respondents are not entitled in law to cultivate the said paddy land in

question, the Original Complainant-Appellants by application dated 04/02/1994,

complained to the 4th Respondent-Respondent-Respondent, the Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services (hereinafter referred to as the Assistant

Commissioner) to conduct an inquiry in order to evict them from the said paddy land

cultivated by the Respondent-Respondents, in terms of Section 14(1) and (2) of the

Agrarian Services Act. It must be noted that the 3rd Respondent-Respondent-Appellant

Respondent, the sister of the 1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondents, namely Amitha

Kanthi (hereinafter referred to as the 3rd Respondent-Respondent) was not a party

Respondent to the application made to the Assistant Commissioner by the original

Complainants and they did not recognize her as a tenant cultivator or even as an

occupier of the subject matter in their application dated 04/02/1994.

The Complainant-Appellants, in their application to the Assistant Commissioner

contended that, the 1st Respondent-Respondent, Ranjith Premalal, presently is a tenant

cultivator of a paddy field called Kohombagaha Kumbura in extent of 3A and also the

permit holder of a paddy field in extent of 2A, belonging to the Mahaweli Authority

and that the 2nd Respondent-Respondent, Gnanasiri, is presently a tenant cultivator of a

paddy filed called Kohombagaha Kumbura South, in extent 2 1/2A, and the owner

cultivator of a paddy filed belonging to the Mahaweli Authority. However, as per P6

and P7, they have placed evidence only to show that Ranjith Premalal was a tenant

cultivator of a paddy field called Kohombagaha Kumbura in extent of 3A for 1994 and

Gnanasiri was a tenant cultivator for 2A 2R in extent of Kohombagaha Kumbara for

1993.

Having considered the evidence led at the said inquiry, the Assistant Commissioner, by

Order dated 25/11/1997 held that, the Respondent-Respondents were cultivating the

P a g e 7 | 14

paddy field at the time their parents, Thomas and Gimara were cultivating the paddy

land and also after their death, and therefore have established a connection with the

Complainant-Appellants as landlord and tenant cultivators.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Complainant- Appellants by Petition of Appeal

dated 27/03/1998, appealed to the Provincial High Court holden in Hambantota,

seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the said Order made by the Assistant Commissioner

and a writ of mandamus to obtain possession of the said land. The Provincial High

Court having considered the question of devolution of rights of a tenant cultivator, in

terms of Section 4(1), 8(1) and 14(1) of the Agrarian Services Act (referred to as the

said Act), by Order dated 27/10/1999, held that, only the 1st Respondent-Respondent

was entitled to succeed to the tenancy in terms of Section 4(1) of the said Act, and that

too, should be limited to in extent 5A. Accordingly, the Court issued a writ of certiorari

to quash the Order of the Commissioner dated 25/11/1997 and a writ of mandamus to

evict the rest of the Respondent-Respondents from the balance portion of the land in

terms of Section 14(2) of the said Act.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Respondent-Respondents, by Petition of Appeal

dated 09/12/1999, appealed to the Court of Appeal (the Appellate Court). The

Appellate Court, inter alia, having taken into consideration documents marked V5

and V6, where it was found that the Complainant-Appellants had accepted the rentals

from the Respondent-Respondents as tenant cultivators, held that, the Assistant

Commissioner, by Order dated 25/11/1997, has correctly decided the issue before him,

and that the learned High Court Judges order to issue a writ of certiorari and

mandamus on the basis that there was an error on the face of the record is erroneous.

Accordingly, the Appellate Court, by Order dated 24/02/2012, set aside the Order of the

learned High Court Judge dated 21/10/1999 and allowed the Appeal.

The Complainant-Appellants, by its Petition dated 02/04/2012, is before this Court to

set aside the said Order dated 24/02/2012, delivered by the Appellate Court.

P a g e 8 | 14

By Order dated 30/04/2015, this Court granted leave to appeal on the following

questions of law.

1. Could the 1st to 3rd Respondents succeed to the tenancy rights of Thomas and

Gimara in terms of the provisions in Section 8(1) of the Agrarian Services Act.

2. Is the Judgment of the Court of Appeal contrary to Section 14(1) and (2) of the

Agrarian Services Act read together with Section 4 of the same Act.

3. Is there an illegality in the Judgment of the High Court for the Court of Appeal to

set aside the same.

4. In the circumstances pleaded, is the Order of the Court of Appeal in terms of law.

In this action, the Complainant-Petitioners made an Application to the Assistant

Commissioner under Section 14(1) and (2) of the Act, stating that;

a. they are the owners of a paddy field known as Helambagahakumbura, in extent

10A, 3R and 4P.

b. Thomas and Gimara, were their tenant cultivators, who died in 1992 and early part

of 1993 respectively.

c. having no rights to cultivate the said paddy field, the 1st and 2nd Respondent-

Respondents, Ranjith Premalal and Gnanasiri, the two sons of the tenant

cultivators, continued to cultivate the said paddy field.

d. the said 1st and 2nd Respondent-Respondents are presently cultivating

Kohombagaha Kumbura as tenant cultivators and paddy fields belonging to the

Mahaweli Authority as a permit holder and as an owner cultivator respectively.

e. to hold an inquiry in terms of Section 14(1) and (2) of the Act, to evict the said

Respondent-Respondents from the said paddy field.

In terms of Section 14 of the Act, where a tenant cultivator of any extent of land dies,

no person who is not entitled under the said Act, to the rights of such tenant cultivator

in respect of such extent, shall occupy and use such extent.

P a g e 9 | 14

Therefore, as observed earlier, the Complainant-Appellants came before the Assistant

Commissioner on the premise that the Respondent-Respondents had no rights under the

said Act to cultivate the said paddy field after the death of previous tenant cultivators

and sought an order of eviction of the Respondent-Respondents. Therefore, it is

pertinent to note that the scope of the Application made by the Complainant-Petitioners

before the Assistant Commissioner was to seek an order to evict the Respondent-

Respondents from the paddy land in terms of Section 14(2), on the basis that the said

persons were not entitled to any tenancy rights of the deceased tenant cultivators.

At the said Inquiry, witness Hewagamage Piyadasa, in cross examination stated that,

the Respondent-Respondents cultivated the paddy filed jointly, as representatives of the

tenant cultivators. This position was corroborated by the second witness called on

behalf of the Complainant-Appellants. The said witnesses appear to be the present

Substituted-Complainant-Appellants. All other witnesses stated that they cultivated

separated/ different parts within the 10+ Acres.

The Original Complainants appear to have not given evidence before the Assistant

Commissioner and as mentioned above, the present Substituted-Complainant-

Appellants appear to be the witnesses for the Original Complainant-Appellants before

the Assistant Commissioner and the said witnesses have denied that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Respondent-Respondents were tenant cultivators of the subject matter. Since a

relationship of that nature is an arrangement between the Landlord and the tenant

cultivator, whether the Substituted Complainant-Appellants as witnesses at that time

had any first-hand knowledge to deny that relationship is questionable. Anyhow, while

giving evidence on behalf of the Original Complainants, willingness to give 5 acres to

the 1st Respondent-Respondent for cultivation has been clearly stated even though the

Original Complainants in their application had stated that the Respondent-Respondents

have no right to the subject matter.

However, in the contrary, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondent-Respondents have given evidence

to show that the 1st Respondent-Respondent worked in a separate portion as a tenant

P a g e 10 | 14

cultivator even when their parents were living. The 3rd Respondent cultivated the

portion worked by her father, Thomas, and the 2nd Respondent cultivated the portion

worked by his mother, Gimara. A Grama Niladari by the name K.M. Nandasena has

given evidence to show that the Respondent-Respondents were cultivating the paddy

field in question, but he came to know the subject matter only since 1996. However, a

tenant cultivator of a nearby paddy field by the name Lionel Liyana Patabendi has given

evidence in favour of the Respondent-Respondents stand that they were cultivating

even when their parents were among the living.

Having taken into consideration the evidence led before the inquiry, the Assistant

Commissioner by Order dated 25/11/1997 stated, that the Respondent-Respondents had

cultivated the said paddy field in the life time of the tenant cultivators, Thomas and

Gimara, and after their death, continued to work as tenant cultivators thus, creating a

landlord tenant relationship. In arriving at this decision, the Assistant Commissioner

has taken into consideration, the evidence given by the respective witnesses and the

documents marked P13 and P14, (the two letters written to the 1st Respondent-

Respondent relating to nonpayment of rent), and documents marked as V5 and V6,

which established paying of due rent by the Respondent-Respondents and the collection

of such proceeds by the landlord, while accepting the Respondent-Respondents as

tenant cultivators. The Assistant Commissioner further held that there is no material

evidence to show that Ranjith Premalal or Gnanasiri had cultivated any other land in

their capacity as tenant cultivator.

It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the Respondent-

Respondents that the Provincial High Court in its Judgment dated 27/10/1999, did not

appreciate the significance of documents marked V5 and V6, and also failed to

examine the Application before the Assistant Commissioner in the context of a

Complaint filed under Section 14(1) and (2) of the Act, instead, considered Section 8(1)

read with Section 4(1) of the Act, and decided that only the 1st Respondent-Respondent,

P a g e 11 | 14

if at all, will be entitled to succeed to the tenancy, and limited the extent of the tenancy

to 5 acres.

In arriving at the said conclusion, the High Court declared that, since Thomas died

without a nomination, the land cultivated by him devolved on the surviving spouse

Gimara and hence she became the tenant cultivator of the entire paddy filed in extent

10 acres. After the death of Gimara her rights devolved on the 1st Respondent being the

eldest child of Thomas and Gimara, and in terms of Section 4(1) of the Act, the Court

held, since the maximum extent of paddy land that could be cultivated by a tenant

cultivator shall be five acres the 1st Respondent was the only tenant cultivator to

succeed to the tenancy.

The learned High Court Judge was of the view that there is an error on the Order

made on 25/11/1997 and by its Judgment dated 27/10/1999, set aside the Order of the

Assistant Commissioner dated 25/11/1997 and accordingly, issued a writ in the nature

of certiorari to quash the order of the Commissioner, a writ of mandamus to comply

with Section 14, and to evict the Respondent-Respondents from the land, leaving 5

acres for the 1st Respondent.

At this juncture it is pertinent to observe that Section 14(2) contemplates the eviction

of occupants who are not entitled under the Act to the rights of the deceased tenant

cultivator from the extent referred to in Section 14(1) which means the total extent

occupied by the deceased tenant cultivator and not from certain parts of it. On the other

hand, Section 4 and its subsections contemplate a different situation where a tenant

cultivator, who generally has a right to occupy, cultivate in excess of the prescribed

limit by law. Further Section 4 provides for the tenant cultivators entitlement with the

approval of the Commissioner to select the extent he is entitled in law to cultivate and

vacate the rest and failing to exercise such entitlement, eviction of the tenant cultivator

from the extent which is in excess of the prescribed limit. The said section also gives

the landlord a right to cultivate the extent vacated by the tenant cultivator or to appoint

one or more tenant cultivators to the extent so vacated by the tenant cultivator.

P a g e 12 | 14

Thus, Section 14 applies to a situation where the paddy field is occupied by a person

who does not have a right to occupy after the death of the tenant cultivator and Section

4 applies to a situation where a tenant cultivator cultivates more than the prescribed

limit. The application before the Assistant Commissioner was based on the premise that

the Respondent-Respondents had no right to the subject matter.

Even one considers that having the maximum limit in another paddy field under some

other landlord is sufficient to apply Section 4 without making the other landlord a party,

still the tenant cultivator may have an option to select his extent to cultivate. It appears

that the learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate above differences between the

situations and circumstances contemplated by said sections.

The learned High Court Judge also failed to appreciate that;

Even though that Section 8 has some relevance in deciding who is entitled to

occupy as possible successors to the deceased tenant cultivators, that the original

application was not made to decide the successor or successors to the deceased

tenant cultivator.

As per the proviso to Section 4(1), even the extent cultivated by the spouse too is

considered in deciding the ceiling prescribed by law and as such, if there was a

cultivation exceeding the 5A limit, it was there from the commencement of

tenancy by the parents of the Respondent-Respondents indicating that cultivation

of the excess extent by children of the deceased tenant cultivators and acceptance

of rent during the life time of the deceased tenant cultivators even for that excess

extent and the evidence to say that 1st Respondent-Respondent cultivated a

separate portion, favour the view that landlord and tenant cultivator relationship

with 1st Respondent-Respondent commenced prior to the death of Respondent-

Respondents parents.

Even if the payment of rent during the life time of the parents of the Respondent-

Respondents were considered as payment of rent as agents of the deceased tenant

P a g e 13 | 14

cultivators, in the above backdrop, accepting of rent from the Respondent

Respondents naming them as tenant cultivators by V5 and V6 supports the

view that there was a new relationship of landlord and tenant cultivators between

the Original Complainant and the Respondent-Respondents and as such, the

landlord cannot use Section 14 to evict his own tenant cultivators. Thus, the

allegations contained in the application before the Assistant Commissioner was

false/ misconceived.

In its Judgment dated 24/02/2012, the Appellate Court having considered documents

marked V5 and V6 led in evidence before the Assistant Commissioner, held that;

The above documents clearly demonstrate the falsity of the Complaint of Amarasena

and Karunawathie. The said document further demonstrates the fact that Amarasena

and Karunawathie had accepted Ranjith Premalal and Gnanasiri as their tenant

cultivators.

The Appellate Court approached the Application filed before the Assistant

Commissioner, as one, in terms of Section 14(1) and (2) of the Agrarian Services Act.

In that context, the Court decided that there was no truth in the Complaint and that the

Respondent-Respondents were the tenant cultivators of the paddy land in question.

Furthermore, the said findings clearly identified the scope of the Complaint before the

Assistant-Commissioner, as formed in terms of Section 14 of the Act. Thus, the Court

of Appeal has correctly recognized the application made to the Assistant Commissioner

as a false application made under Section 14 to evict the tenant cultivators.

Accordingly, I answer the questions of law on which leave to appeal has been granted

to the Complainant-Appellant, (and which has been quoted earlier), as follows

1. Since it was found that the Respondent-Respondents are tenant cultivators who

have their own right to occupy, Section 8(1) of the Act, has no application to the

instant Appeal and accordingly, is answered in the negative.

P a g e 14 | 14

2. The Assistant Commissioner has a duty to decide the correctness of the

application. The Court of Appeal correctly found the application was based on a

wrong premise and the Respondent-Respondents are Tenant Cultivators on their

own as found by the Assistant Commissioner. Thus, this question of law does not

arise as correctly found by the Court of Appeal, the application before the

Commissioner was based on false footing.

3. Answered in the affirmative as the learned High Court Judge failed in

appreciating relevant aspects as explained above.

4. Answered in the affirmative.

For these reasons, this Appeal is dismissed; the Judgment of the Appellate Court is

affirmed; and that of the Provincial High Court is set aside. No order for costs.
