"if at all, will be entitled to succeed to the tenancy, and limited the extent of the tenancy"
"to 5 acres."
"In  arriving  at  the  said  conclusion,  the  High  Court  declared  that,  since  Thomas  died"
"without  a  nomination,  the  land  cultivated  by  him  devolved  on  the  surviving  spouse"
"Gimara and hence she became the tenant cultivator of the entire paddy filed in extent"
"10 acres. After the death of Gimara her rights devolved on the 1st Respondent being the"
"eldest child of Thomas and Gimara, and in terms of Section 4(1) of the Act, the Court"
"held,  “since  the  maximum  extent  of  paddy  land  that could  be  cultivated  by  a  tenant"
"cultivator  shall  be  five  acres”  the  1st  Respondent  was  the  only  tenant  cultivator  to"
"succeed to the tenancy."
"The learned High Court Judge  was  of the view that  “there is an error on the  Order"
"made on 25/11/1997” and by its Judgment dated 27/10/1999, set aside the Order of the"
"Assistant Commissioner dated 25/11/1997 and accordingly, issued a writ in the nature"
"of certiorari to quash the order of the Commissioner, a writ of mandamus to comply"
"with  Section  14,  and  to  evict  the  Respondent-Respondents  from  the  land,  leaving  5"
"acres for the 1st Respondent."
"At this juncture it is pertinent to observe that Section 14(2) contemplates the eviction"
"of  occupants  who  are  not  entitled  under  the Act  to  the  rights  of  the  deceased  tenant"
"cultivator  from  the  extent  referred  to  in  Section  14(1)  which  means  the  total  extent"
"occupied by the deceased tenant cultivator and not from certain parts of it. On the other"
"hand,  Section  4  and  its  subsections  contemplate  a  different  situation  where  a  tenant"
"cultivator,  who  generally has a  right  to occupy,  cultivate  in  excess  of  the prescribed"
"limit by law. Further Section 4 provides for the tenant cultivator’s entitlement with the"
"approval of the Commissioner to select the extent he is entitled in law to cultivate and"
"vacate the rest and failing to exercise such entitlement, eviction of the tenant cultivator"
"from the extent which is in excess of the prescribed limit. The said section also gives"
"the landlord a right to cultivate the extent vacated by the tenant cultivator or to appoint"
"one or more tenant cultivators to the extent so vacated by the tenant cultivator."
