"Moreover, in Oberholzer v Oberholzer (1921) South African Law Reports Appellate Division"
"274, Innes CJ held:"
"“These  matrimonial  cases  throw  a  great  responsibility  upon  a  judge  of the  first"
"instance; with the exercise of which we should be slow to interfere. He is able not"
"only to estimate the credibility of the parties but to judge of their temperament and"
"character. And we, who have not had the advantage of seeing and hearing them"
"must be careful not to interfere, unless we are certain, on firm grounds, that he is"
"wrong.”"
