"In N.J.Canekaratne v Mrs. R.M.D. Canekeratne 66 NLR 380, it was held:"
"“…. it is correct to say that the conduct of the parties up to and including the time"
"of the trial is relevant when the court has to decide who is to blame. Certainly up"
"to  the  stage  of  entering  decree  nisi  it  is  the  duty  of  each  party  to  provide  a"
"reasonable  opportunity  for  a  resumption  of  married  life,  and  the  party  who"
"deliberately and unreasonably refuses to accept that opportunity will be guilty of"
"malicious desertion.”"
