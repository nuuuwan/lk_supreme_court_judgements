"22.","It was further submitted that, although a presumed contract"
"","of tenancy was created when the respondent was confronted"
"","with  the  demand  of  vacation  on  the  letter  [‘P-8’]  and  the"
"","respondent  continued 
to  occupy 
the  premises, 
the  said"
"","presumed  contract  of  tenancy  was  set 
in  nought  by  the"
"","conduct of the respondent in failing to indicate that she was a"
"","lawful tenant and/ or in tendering rent to the appellant. Mere"
"","deposit  of  rent  in  favour  of  the  father  without  bothering  to"
"","verify, 
could  not  have 
resulted 
in 
sustaining 
the 
said"
"","presumed contract of tenancy."
"Written submissions on behalf of the Respondent.",""
"23.","The  learned  Counsel  for  the  respondent  submitted  that,  the"
"","principal  matter  that  has  to  be  decided  by  this  Court  is"
"","whether  the  respondent  was  in  unlawful  occupation  of  the"
"","premises. The title of the premises has been admitted in favour"
"","of the appellant."
"24.","It was submitted by the learned Counsel that, the appellant in"
"","cross examination on 14.07.2010 (pages 85-88 of the appeal"
"","brief) by admitting the signature of the rent receipts to be that"
"","of her father’s [marked ‘V-1’-‘V-14’] corroborates the position"
"","of  the  respondent  that  she  was  not  a  trespasser  but  was"
"","occupying the premises as a tenant of Dean."
"25.","It was further submitted that, according to the evidence of the"
"","appellant (at pages 65, 66, 67 and 93 of the appeal brief), her"
"","father,  Dean,  has  been  managing  the  premises  in  suit  on"
"","behalf  of  the  appellant  with  her  implied  agreement  in  the"
"","capacity  of  an  agent.  An  agency  is  implied  from  the  special"
"","circumstances of this case, and the appellant as the principal"
"","was  bound  by 
the  contracts  entered 
into  by  her  agent."
"","Therefore,  a  valid  tenancy  existed  between  the  appellant’s"
"","father and the respondent and the appellant was bound by the"
"","contract of tenancy created by her father though he was not"
"","her predecessor in title."
"26.","The learned Counsel further submitted that, even after being"
"","aware  that  a  business  was  in  operation  for  20  years  in  the"
"","premises,  the  appellant  by  not  raising  her  concerns  has"
"","acquiesced the same (pages 69 and 70 of the appeal brief)."
