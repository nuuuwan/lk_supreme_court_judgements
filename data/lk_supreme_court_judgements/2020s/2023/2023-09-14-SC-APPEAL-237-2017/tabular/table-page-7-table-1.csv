"","entitled to an order evicting the Defendant who is a trespasser"
"","as against her.”"
"13.","The learned Counsel further submitted that, although the case"
"","of  Imbuldeniya(supra)  was  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  Civil"
"","Appellate  High  Court,  there  was  no  reference  as  to  why  the"
"","ratio in that case would not apply to the present case or could"
"","be distinguishable on facts."
"14.","It was further submitted that, the Civil Appellate High Court"
"","erred in taking the view that the appellant was not entitled in"
"","law to seek eviction, when the tenancy of the respondent with"
"","Dean  was  intact.  Since  the  appellant’s  title  was  not  derived"
"","from the father, she was not bound by the tenancy created by"
"","the 
father  and  there  could  not  have  been  an  automatic"
"","succession to the position of landlord, in the manner found in"
"","the  Civil  Appellate  High  Court  on  the  strength  of  Izadeen"
"","Mohamed v. Singer Sewing Machine [1962] 64 N.L.R. 407"
"","and Bhojraj v. Abdulla [1998] 1 Sri.L.R. 1 which dealt with"
"","distinguishable  situations  where  new  purchasers  would  be"
"","compelled to accept sitting tenants."
"15.","The learned Counsel for the appellant further submitted that,"
"","the  respondent  asserting  lawful  tenancy  under  the  father  of"
"","the  appellant,  did  not  bother  to  reply  and/  or  dispute  the"
"","contents  of  the  said 
letter 
[‘P-8’]  which  was  sent  by  an"
"","Attorney-at-Law on instructions. This being a business and/"
"","or  an  official  letter  challenging  the  right  of  the  recipient  to"
"","occupy the property in suit, it is incumbent on the recipient to"
"","dispute the facts therein. Reference was made to the case of"
"","Saravanamuttu v. De Mel [1948] 49 N.L.R. 529 where it was"
"","held that, the failure or silence of the recipient of a business"
"","letter indicating that a certain state of facts exists, amounts to"
"","an admission of the truth of the allegations contained in that"
"","letter.  The 
inference  drawn 
from  the  silence 
is  that,  the"
"","contents  of  the  letter  were  true  and  that  the  respondent  did"
"","not assert any tenancy under the appellant."
"16.","The  learned  Counsel  further  submitted  that,  although  the"
"","notice[‘P-8’] did not contain a request by the appellant to the"
"","respondent asking her to attorn the appellant as the landlord,"
"","the respondent could have availed herself of the opportunity"
"","to  attorn,  in  which  event  the  appellant  would  have  to  elect"
