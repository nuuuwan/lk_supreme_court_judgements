"","either to accept attornment to treat the respondent as a tenant"
"","or to deny attornment to treat the defendant as a trespasser."
"17.","It  was  further  submitted  by  the  learned  Counsel  that,  even"
"","after 
the  receipt  of 
the 
letter 
[‘P-8’] 
the  respondent  had"
"","deposited  money  in  a  Bank  of  Ceylon  account  in  favour  of"
"","Dean from April 2008 to October 2008 [receipts marked ‘V-41’-"
"","‘V-46’]. According to the case of Violet Perera v. Asilin Nona"
"","[1996] 1 Sri.L.R. 1 depositing rent in favour of Dean after the"
"","receipt  of  the  letter  [‘P-8’]  cannot  be  treated  as  a  proper"
"","payment made to the landlord, as the appellant has held out"
"","that she is the owner of the premises in suit."
"18.","The learned Counsel further submitted that, if the respondent"
"","was confronted with a situation in which she was in doubt as"
"","to  whom  the  payment  should  be  made,  the  simplest  thing"
"","should have been to reply to [‘P-8’] asking for more particulars"
"","and attorned to the appellant by offering to pay rent to her."
"19.","It was further submitted that, the appellant cannot be faulted"
"","for sending the said letter [‘P-8’] as she was not bound by the"
"","contract  of 
tenancy  created  by 
the 
father,  and 
it  was"
"","incumbent on the respondent to indicate her position coupled"
"","with  an  offer  to  pay  rent  to  the  appellant.  The  conduct  of  a"
"","reasonable  person  under  normal  circumstances  would  have"
"","been  to  send  a  reply  asking  for  further  details.  Further,  the"
"","fact that the address indicated in the notice[‘P-8’] being similar"
"","to the address of Dean [receipts D15-D16 at pages 272,273 of"
"","the appeal brief] is an additional reason for the respondent to"
"","have responded to the notice [‘P-8’]."
"20.","The learned Counsel for the appellant further submitted that,"
"","the respondent should not be allowed to insist on the privity"
"","with Dean by keeping silent as the respondent has not acceded"
"","to the demand in [‘P-8’] and continued to occupy the premises"
"","when  the  contract  of  tenancy  was  being  challenged  by  the"
"","contents of letter [‘P-8’]."
"21.","The learned Counsel further submitted that, assuming but not"
"","conceding that the letter [‘P-8’] was not a notice to attorn, the"
"","contents as indicated by a legal professional on instructions,"
"","should not have been ignored on the basis that the appellant"
"","was not entitled to send such notice."
