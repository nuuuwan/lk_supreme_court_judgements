"","subsistence between the respondent and Dean even at the time"
"","of filing action."
"37.","It  was  further  submitted  that,  the  appellant  could  not  have"
"","instituted  the  instant  action  against  the  respondent,  without"
"","having repudiated the contract of tenancy that existed between"
"","her father and the respondent."
"38.","I will first answer the question of law set out in Paragraph 15(ii)"
"","of the petition."
"","Did the Courts below err in law by failing to take into account"
"","that  the  tenancy  created  by  the  father  without  a  title  to  the"
"","premises in suit, was not binding on the plaintiff?"
"39.","When considering the testimony of the appellant, the appellant"
"","in  cross  examination  on  14.07.2010  (at  pages  85-88  of  the"
"","appeal  brief)  has  admitted  the  signature  of  the  rent  receipts"
"","[marked ‘V-1’-‘V-14’] to be that of her father’s. Therefore, it can"
"","be  established  that  a  valid  contract  of  tenancy  subsisted"
"","between the father of the appellant and the respondent."
"40.","Further,  according  to  the  evidence  of  the  appellant,  she  has"
"","consistently  stated  that  her  father  Dean,  has  been  managing"
"","the  premises  in  question  ever  since  he  got  married  to  the"
"","appellant’s  mother. 
Accordingly, 
when 
considering 
the"
"","circumstances  of  this  case,  an  agency  can  be  inferred  as  the"
"","appellant  has  allowed  her  father  to  continue  to  manage  the"
"","premises even after her mother transferred the property to her."
"","It can be stated that, the father of the appellant was acting as"
"","an agent of the appellant under the implied agreement of the"
"","appellant. Where an agency is inferred, when the agent (father"
"","of the appellant) enters into a contract with the respondent, the"
"","principal 
(appellant)  would  be  bound  by 
such 
contract."
"","Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, as a valid tenancy"
"","existed between the appellant’s father and the respondent, the"
"","appellant being the principal will be bound by the contract of"
"","tenancy created by her father."
"41.","The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that, the case"
"","of  Imbuldeniya(supra) dealt with  a  similar situation, however,"
"","although  this  case  was  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  Civil"
"","Appellate High Court, reference has not been made as to why"
