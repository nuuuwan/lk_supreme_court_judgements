"","the case of Imbuldeniya(supra) is not applicable to the instant"
"","case."
"42.","However, the learned Counsel for the respondent pointed out"
"","that, the case of Imbuldeniya(supra) has no bearing to the facts"
"","of the instant case, as the facts of it are different to the instant"
"","case."
"43.","When considering the facts of the case of Imbuldeniya(supra),"
"","the  father  of  the  plaintiff  has  let  out  the  premises  to  the"
"","defendant and appropriated the rent for himself. He has done"
"","so for his own benefit without the authority from the plaintiff."
"","At the time the property was let out, the plaintiff was not aware"
"","that  she  was  the  absolute  owner.  Further,  when  the  father"
"","rented the premises to the defendant, he was not acting as her"
"","agent. The father had no right or any authority to rent out the"
"","premises to the defendant. The plaintiff neither acquiesced in"
"","or adopted the letting by her father to the defendant."
"44.","Thus, as the case facts of Imbuldeniya(supra) are not similar to"

"","absolute  owner,  she  continued  to  let  her  father  manage  the"
"","property in suit."
"45.","With regard to the first question of law that has been raised, it"
"","is  my  view  that,  in  light  of  the  evidence  and  the  facts  and"
"","circumstances of the instant case,  the courts below have  not"
"","erred in law and have correctly come to the conclusion that the"
"","tenancy created by the father of the appellant is binding on the"
"","appellant."
"46.","Now I will consider the second question of law that has been"
"","set out in paragraph 15(iv) of the petition."
"","Did  the  Courts  below  err  in  law  by  not  following  the  legal"
"","consequences  flowing  from  the  failure  of  the  defendant  to"
"","respond to letter ‘P8’?"
"47.","The learned Counsel for the appellant by relying on the case of"
"","Saravanamuttu  v.  De  Mel  [1948]  49  N.L.R.  529  took  the"
