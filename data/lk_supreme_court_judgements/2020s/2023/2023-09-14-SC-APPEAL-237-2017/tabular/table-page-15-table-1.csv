"","instant case, the failure of the respondent to reply to the letter"
"","[‘P-8’] would not in itself amount to an admission of the truth"
"","of the contents of that letter."
"52.","Therefore, it is my view that, the Courts below have not erred"
"","in 
law  when  deciding  on 
the 
legal  position 
following 
the"
"","respondent’s failure to reply to the letter [‘P-8’]."
"53.","Thirdly,  I  will  answer  the  final  question  of  law  set  out  in"
"","paragraph 15(vi) of the petition."
"","Whether  the  Courts  below  err  in  law  by  the  finding  that  the"
"","tenancy of the defendant would continue notwithstanding the"
"","repudiation of the presumed conduct by her, after the receipt"
"","of ‘P8’."
"54.","The appellant took up the position that, although a presumed"
"","contract 
of 
tenancy  was 
created  when 
the 
respondent"
"","continued  to  occupy  the  premises  even  after  the  letter  [‘P-8’]"
"","demanding  vacation,  this  contract  was  repudiated  when  the"
"","respondent failed to indicate that she was a lawful tenant and"
"","failed to pay rent to the appellant."
"55.","It was brought to the attention of this Court that, according to"
"","the document marked [‘P-5’] (page 215 of the appeal brief), the"
"","father of the appellant had been alive when the said letter [‘P-"
"","8’] was sent by the appellant to the respondent. The letter [‘P-"
"","8’]  was  sent  on  25.03.2008  and  the  death  of  the  appellant’s"
"","father had occurred on 07.07.2008 [‘P-5’]. Further, action has"
"","also been instituted on 30.04.2008 [plaint ‘X-1’] which is before"
"","the death of the appellant’s father. Therefore, a valid contract"
"","existed between Dean and the respondent at the time the letter"
"","[‘P-8’] was sent, and also at the time action was instituted by"
"","the appellant."
"56.","Thus, as the appellant was not entitled to send the letter [‘P-8’]"
"","while her father was alive, it is my view that, the Courts below"
"","have  not  erred 
in  law  by 
finding  that  the  tenancy  of  the"
"","respondent would continue even after the receipt of the letter"
"","[‘P-8’]."
