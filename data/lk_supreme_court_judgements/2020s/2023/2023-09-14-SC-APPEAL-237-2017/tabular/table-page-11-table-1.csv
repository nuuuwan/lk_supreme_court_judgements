"31.","It was submitted by the learned Counsel that, the failure on the"
"","part of the respondent to reply to the letter [‘P-8’] does not give"
"","rise to an adverse inference against the respondent, as she was"
"","unaware of the change in ownership of the premises and bona"
"","fide  accepted  Dean  as  her  landlord.  Further,  there  was  no"
"","necessity  for  the  respondent  to  reply  to  a  letter  sent  by  a"
"","complete stranger."
"32.","It was further submitted that, in the case of Saravanamuttu"
"","v.  De  Mel 
[1948]  49  N.L.R.  529,  exceptions  to  the  rule"
"","requiring a person who does not agree with the contents of a"
"","letter  to  dispute  the  assertions  have  been  set  out.  “…  .For"
"","example,  failure 
to  reply 
to  mere  begging 
letters  when 
the"
"","circumstances show that there was no necessity for the recipient"
"","of the letter to reply can give rise to no adverse inference against"
"","the recipient.”"
"33.","The learned Counsel made reference to the case of Disanayake"
"","Mudiyanselage 
Chandrapala 
Meegahaarawa 
v."
"","Disanayake Mudiyanselage Samaraweera Meegahaarawa"
"","SC Appeal No. 112/2018, S.C. min. 21.05.2021, where the"
"","impact  of  the  failure  to  reply  to  a  letter  was  discussed  and"
"","where it was stated that, the impact of the failure to reply would"
"","depend on the facts and circumstances of each case."
"34.","It was further submitted by the learned Counsel that, the said"
"","quit  notice  cannot  be  considered  in  law  as  a  notice  to  attorn"
"","since 
the  said 
letter  does  not  consist  of  a  notice  of 
the"
"","appellant’s election to recognize the respondent as a tenant."
"35.","The learned Counsel for the respondent further submitted that,"
"","the learned High Court Judges in affirming the judgment of the"
"","learned District Judge, has carefully arrived at the conclusion"
"","that  the  document  marked  [‘P-8’]  cannot  in  any  conceivable"
"","sense be considered as a notice of attornment. In any event, by"
"","the  time  the  letter  [‘P-8’]  was  sent,  the  defendant  was  not  in"
"","illegal occupation of the premises."
"36.","The learned Counsel further submitted that, according to the"
"","document marked [‘P-5’] (at page 215 of the appeal brief) as at"
"","the  date  the  letter  marked  [‘P-8’]  was  sent,  and  at  the  time"
"","action was instituted, Dean had been alive. It was submitted by"
"","the  learned  Counsel  that,  a  valid  contract  of  tenancy  was  in"
