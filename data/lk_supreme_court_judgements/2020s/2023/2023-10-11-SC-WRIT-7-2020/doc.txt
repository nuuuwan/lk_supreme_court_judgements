Order

Aluwihare PC J.,

(1) The Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this court in terms of Article 104H

of the Constitution and sought writs in the nature of Certiorari and

Mandamus on the basis that the decision of the 4th Respondent to reject the

nomination papers tendered by the Political Party the Petitioner represents,

to contest the election of members to the Parliament from the electoral

district of Trincomalee, is ultra vires.

(2) The Petitioner supported this application for notices on the respondent and

the court heard the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner, the learned Presidents Counsel for the 15th Respondent and the

learned Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st, 2nd and the 4th Respondents.

(3) The National Congress, a political party recognized under and in terms of

Section 7(4)(b) of the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 01 of 1981

(hereinafter referred to as the Parliamentary Elections Act) tendered their

nomination paper for the Parliamentary Election of 2020 which was

rejected on the basis that the oath/affirmation set out in the Seventh

Schedule of the Constitution was not duly tendered.

7

(4) The Petitioner, the Secretary General of the National Congress by his

petition sought a declaration that the determination made by the 4th

Respondent, Returning Officer of the Electoral District of Trincomalee to

reject the nomination paper of the National Congress to be illegal, void and

of no effect or avail in law on the following grounds;

a) The 4th Respondent has no power or authority under the Parliamentary

Elections Act No. 01 of 1981 to reject the said nomination paper on the

grounds set out in the letter marked P3a and P3b and as such the

decision is ultra vires,

b) The said decision is ex facie bad in law and unsupported by evidence and

ultra vires,

c) Ex facie the nomination paper has been submitted by the National

Congress in compliance with the law and as such the said determination

of the 4th Respondent is unsupported by evidence and unreasonable in

all the circumstances of the case,

d) The said determination of the 4th Respondent has been occasioned by the

failure to take into account relevant circumstances and is therefore

unsupported by evidence,

e) The said decision of the 4th Respondent is arbitrary, unreasonable, illegal,

in breach of the principles of natural justice and contrary to legitimate

expectations and need for accountability and transparency,

f) The 4th Respondent has failed to pose the correct question, namely; as to

whether the said nomination paper had been submitted in accordance

with the law and thereby misdirected himself and fallen into the further

error of failing to take into account all the relevant circumstances,

g) The said determination is vitiated by the failure to give reasons for

arriving at the said decision,

h) The said decision is in breach of the 4th Respondents duty to advance the

franchise,

8

i) The said rejection had been occasioned by the failure to properly

construe the terms of the said nomination paper and as such is vitiated

by an error of law,

j) The said rejection gravely undermines the free and unfettered exercise

of the choice vested in the people in the exercise of their franchise.

(5) It was contended on behalf of the Petitioner that his party submitted the

nomination paper with the names of 7 candidates to be elected to the

Parliament at the Parliamentary Election of 2020 from the Electoral District

of Trincomalee. It was pointed out that the nomination paper was as

required by the law and that each of the seven candidates have expressed

their written consent and subscribed their respective oath or affirmation in

the Form set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and endorsed

in the said nomination paper. The nomination paper was delivered to the

4th Respondent by the first named candidate who is the authorized agent

before the expiry of the nomination period on 19th March 2020.

(6) After the closure of the nomination period the 4th Respondent had declared

that the nomination paper of the National Congress was rejected. The 4th

Respondent had issued a letter dated 19th March 2020 both in Sinhala and

Tamil marked P3a and P3b respectively. The same states that, acting

under Section 19(2) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, which requires the

returning officer to inform the secretary or the group leader who submitted

the nomination paper of the fact of such rejection. The letter also states that

the nomination paper was rejected under Section 19(1)(d) of the

Parliamentary Elections Act for not fulfilling the requirements under Section

15(2).

(7) Section 15(2) requires that the written consent of each candidate to be

nominated and an oath or affirmation in the Form set out in the Seventh

9

Schedule to the Constitution by every such candidate shall be endorsed on

the nomination paper.

(8) Section 19(1)(d) of the Act, empowers the returning officer to reject any

nomination paper where the consent of one or more candidates nominated

or the oath or affirmation in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule to the

Constitution have not been endorsed on the nomination paper.

(9) It was contended that the Petitioner and his political party were not given

an adequate explanation of the reason or the reasons for the rejection. By

letter marked P4 dated 20th March 2020 the Petitioner had requested for

the specific reason in writing for the rejection of the nomination paper and

requested for a certified copy of the nomination paper submitted by his

party. He had not received a reply to this letter and the Petitioner states that

by the fax dated 23rd April 2020 marked P8 addressed to the 1st

Respondent he had again requested a certified copy of the nomination paper

submitted by his party. The letter had been followed by an email on 24th

April 2020 to the same effect by the Petitioner. These communications had

not received a reply.

(10) The Petitioner had handed over a letter dated 1st May 2020 to the 1st

Respondent inter alia drawing his attention to the letters marked P4 and

P8 referred to above. By this letter marked P9 the Petitioner had appealed

to the Election Commission to review the 4th Respondents decision to reject

the nomination paper and to allow the party to contest the Parliamentary

Election, as the party had filed its nomination paper in compliance with the

law. The Petitioner, however, had not received a reply to this letter either.

(11) By letter dated 3rd June 2020 marked P10 addressed to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Respondents respectively the Petitioner had demanded from the Election

Commission to reconsider the 4th Respondents decision and permit the

10

National Congress to contest the Parliamentary Election. He had further

demanded a certified copy of the nomination paper and connected

documents tendered by the National Congress. The letter too had not

received a response.

(12) As enumerated above the Petitioner had made several requests for a certified

copy of the nomination paper submitted by the National Congress and a

detailed explanation of the reason for rejection of the nomination paper,

from the 4th Respondent and later from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents.

(13) By virtue of Section 19(1)(d) of the Parliamentary Elections Act the

Returning Officer has the authority to examine the nomination papers

received by him and reject any nomination paper. where the consent of

one or more candidates nominated or the oath or affirmation, in the form

set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, of one or more

candidates, had or have not been endorsed on the nomination paper.

Section 19(2) specifically states that the decision of the returning officer to

reject such nomination paper shall be final. There is no explicit requirement

for the returning officer to further explain the reason for rejecting a

nomination paper. Section 19(2) only requires Where any nomination

paper has been rejected by the returning officer under subsection (1), the

returning officer shall inform the secretary of the recognized political party

or the group leader, as the case may be, who had submitted such nomination

paper the fact of such rejection.

(14) The nomination paper submitted by the Petitioners party, the National

Congress was submitted to court by the Election Commission, and we have

had the opportunity of examining the same. According to our observations

the nomination paper is defective due to two grounds;

11

1. The 7th Schedule to the Constitution requires the respective candidate

to either declare and affirm or swear. Thereby the requirement is

either to submit an oath or in the alternative, an affirmation. The

omission to strike through the unnecessary words and specify whether

it is an oath or an affirmation that is being made has rendered the

nomination paper submitted by the Petitioners political party defective.

2. Section 12(3) of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance No. 09 of 1895

(as amended) states that any oath or affirmation shall state truly in the

jurat or attestation at what place and what date the same was

administered or taken The failure to fulfill the requirement of stating

the place at which the oath or affirmation was administered or taken has

rendered the nomination paper submitted by the Petitioners political

party defective.

(15) On these grounds it is evident that the nomination paper submitted by the

Petitioner is defective and warrants rejection. As mentioned before, the

returning officer is bound to inform the fact of rejection to the respective

secretary of the party or the group leader of the independent group, but

there is no explicit requirement for the returning officer to spell out the

reason for rejecting the nomination paper.

(16) As the candidacy at an election involves not only the rights of the candidates

but also the rights of the electors, transparency and specificity may very well

be virtues to uphold. While stating the provisions on whose authority a

nomination paper is rejected, mentioning the exact grounds for the

rejection, where possible, may serve to demonstrate to the candidates that

such rejection was done on justifiable grounds. It may very well settle the

minds of the candidates and prevent the need for litigation such as the

present matter.

12

(17) Be that as it may, in the present application the returning officer has carried

out the duties recumbent on him and the Petitioner has been duly notified.

On such observation, notice is refused.
