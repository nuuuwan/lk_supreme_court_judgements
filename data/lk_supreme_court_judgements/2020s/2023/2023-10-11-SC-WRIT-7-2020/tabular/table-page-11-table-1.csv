"1.   The 7th Schedule to the Constitution requires the respective candidate"
"to  either  ‘declare and affirm’  or  ‘swear’.  Thereby  the  requirement  is"
"either  to  submit  ‘an  oath’  or  in  the  alternative,  ‘an  affirmation’.  The"
"omission to strike through the unnecessary words and specify whether"
"it  is  an  oath  or  an  affirmation  that  is  being  made  has  rendered  the"
"nomination paper submitted by the Petitioner’s political party defective."
